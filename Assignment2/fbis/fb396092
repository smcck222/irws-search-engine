<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Samoylenko: "Everyone Is Happy With </F>
the Elections in Kazakhstan. Except for Certain Skeptics From 
the CSCE?"] 
  [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty]--The elections for the new 
parliament in Kazakhstan were not the most routine news of 
recent days. On 8 March such press agencies as ASSOCIATED PRESS, 
REUTERS, and ITAR-TASS greatly distressed women of the world 
community with the news that "the elections in Kazakhstan did 
not correspond to international standards of democracy." 
  Men were also distressed. Particularly on the Central 
Election Commission of Kazakhstan. They were so upset that they 
lost the power of speech for the three women's days, and this 
whole time "enemy radio voices" (the enemies are all those who 
do not flatter!) tarred unimpeded the facade of young Kazakhstan 
democracy. 
  It is impossible to take what happened seriously. It was 
foolish to expect in the parliamentary births the daughter of 
Democracy, not having conceived her in good time (surely the 
nomenklatura fathers of Kazakhstan understand this?!), and it 
was just as foolish (on the part of the CSCE observers) 
heart-rendingly wailing to the world that in Kazakhstan (ah, in 
Kazakhstan itself!!!), apparently, there is a tight situation 
when it comes to freedom and fairness. 
  I personally am amazed by something else--the fantastic 
haste 
with which Jan Van Hauvelingen's delegation at the news 
conference on 8 March accused Kazakhstan of "the aims of free 
and fair elections not being met." 
  The trouble with these Dutch and Americans and the 
miscellaneous world community is that, despite the imagination 
of the ladies and gentlemen, they are not given to understand 
the entire "distinctiveness," "youthfulness," and 
"individuality" of our democracy. Whence it transpires that what 
for them is nomenklatura willfulness is for us "the 
indisputable"--in N. Nazarbayev's expression--"success of young 
Kazakhstan democracy." What for them is staggering confusion is 
for us "difficult weather conditions." Earlier spring did not 
indulge the farmers, now (who could have thought it!) the 
climate is hampering democratic transformations also. 
  In other words, the misfortunes of some are the blessings of 
others. The CSCE observers were extremely upset by the fact that 
Kazakhstan had not in its organization of the elections abided 
all that much by the Paris Charter. And a polling station of an 
Alma-Ata district could not even remember this charter when, 
prior to the counting of the vote, "extra" ballot boxes full of 
ballots miraculously appeared. In the opinion of the CSCE 
experts, the Kazakhstan elections were not in the best harmony 
with the Helsinki Final Act either. And at other polling 
stations the ballots were printed either only in Kazakh or only 
in Russian. 
  But if there is a desire to be at one with the world 
community (which was why observers were summoned to the 
elections), there had to be some response to the critical 
passages of the CSCE broadcast to the world. And a response was 
forthcoming. The Central Election Commission of Kazakhstan 
called its own news conference and... tore to shreds the 
conclusion of the observers of the CSCE, and this was done with 
such assured self-satisfaction, what is more, as though 
Kazakhstan had accumulated a wealth of experience of life in the 
channel of international charters and acts. 
  This was an odd news conference. The Central Election 
Commission pressed invitations on the ambassadors of Iran and 
Turkey (why not Britain and the United States?), and for some 
reason or other the presidium contained representatives of the 
General Procuracy and the Supreme Court of Kazakhstan, the 
ministers of the press and foreign affairs, and the deputy 
chairman of the Council of Ministers in charge of the press! Why 
had I, a journalist, to work in the presence of ambassadors of 
foreign states and, simultaneously, people from the General 
Procuracy?! Dissatisfaction with the elections was expressed by 
"individual" representatives of the CSCE. Why were the opinions 
of the ambassadors of France and Romania distributed in the 
cloakroom of the news conference? What, did they not agree with 
the CSCE in its evaluation of the elections in Kazakhstan? 
  In short, the Kazakhstan Central Election Commission smeared 
findings of the group of observers of the CSCE on the wall, 
going so far as to say that they did not have the right to stage 
their news conference and "should have notified us." 
  What can we say.... The ways of the former party 
functionaries of assessing themselves as the inspiration behind 
and organizers of all our victories remain exactly what they 
used to be. They never allowed and do not now allow anyone, the 
CSCE included, to cast doubt on their "successes." Yesterday 
they were foaming at the mouth, defending the sanctity of the 
CPSU and pushing into parliament milkers, plasterers, and 
slaughtermen. Today these same people are proud that in the 
"new" parliament there are one worker and three Jews--and all 
have higher education. 
  The most distressing thing is that Kazakhstan's first 
contact 
with the CSCE ended, through the fault of local functionaries, 
in a row. A shame. It is time to break ourselves of the habit of 
pouting and bawling out dissenters. It is time to learn to 
listen closely to people, from a long way off included, and to 
thank them for their assistance, even if these people have in 
some respects artlessly erred.

<F P=106> [Interview with Otakhon Latifi, chairman of the board of the </F>
coordinating center of Tajikistan's democratic forces in the CIS 
countries, by OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent Aleksandr Karpov; 
place and date not given: "Opposition Is for National Accord"] 
  [Text] The Tajik problem may only be solved by 
political methods--this is the main result of negotiations 
between the delegation of forces in opposition to the current 
official Dushanbe with the Russian MFA [Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs] leadership, which were held under UN sponsorship in 
Teheran. Our correspondent Aleksandr Karpov interviews a member 
of the Tajik delegation at this meeting--Otakhon Latifi, 
chairman of the board of the coordinating center of Tajikistan's 
democratic forces in the CIS. 
  [Karpov] Why did the negotiations process on the Tajik 
problem begin with, of all things, the opposition meeting with 
the Russian political leadership? 
  [Latifi] It is our deep conviction that negotiations with 
current Tajik authorities are impossible without first 
discussing the Russian factor. Russia, which alternately 
supported either one or the other side in the confrontation, 
found itself, willy-nilly, directly involved in this conflict. 
Today the official regime in Tajikistan is holding up only 
because of the presence of the Russian army, which in its 
actions transcends the boundaries of peacekeeping tasks and 
constantly interferes in the internal affairs of a sovereign 
independent state. This has been acknowledged by international 
experts, Russian analysts, and the Russian press. One of the 
important results of the meeting in Teheran is the general 
understanding that peacekeeping forces in our republic may even 
be represented by Russia's 201st motorized rifle division but on 
the condition that it will be authorized by the United Nations. 
  [Karpov] Opposition leaders' statements at various times 
often mentioned Russia's special geopolitical interests in 
Tajikistan. What specifically do they have in mind? 
  [Latifi] The economy--it is the uranium industry in 
Leninabad 
Oblast. Do not forget that the first Soviet atomic bomb was 
built using uranium ore mined around the city of Chkalovsk. Many 
among our enterprises also have direct ties with plants and 
factories in the Russian Federation. In the political sphere, 
Tajikistan has always been and remains a gate to the East for 
Russia; Russian positions in Iran, Afghanistan, and India depend 
to a considerable extent on relations with Tajikistan. Anyway, 
how can one discard ties that go back more than 200 years? 
  [Karpov] For a long time, Tajikistan's official authorities 
kept saying that they could not sit down at the negotiating 
table with the opposition, whose "hands are in blood up to the 
elbows." The opposition, in turn, maintained that they have 
nothing to discuss with a puppet government... 
  [Latifi] Most such mutual accusations are a thing of the 
past. During his latest trip to Tashkent, Emomali Rakhmonov said 
that he is willing to sit down at the negotiating table with any 
official representative of the opposition forces regardless of 
his political views. As to blood on the opposition's hands, I 
want to remind that opposition in Tajikistan had never been in 
power. Right now, however, the important point is that there is 
an opportunity to reach a sensible solution, in which there 
should be no place for ambitions. 
  [Karpov] Criminal proceedings, which are investigated by the 
republic procuracy, have been initiated against many opposition 
leaders in Tajikistan... 
  [Latifi] One of the terms of truce is that all these 
proceedings will be terminated. 
  [Karpov] Probably the first round of negotiations between 
the 
opposition and the representatives of Tajikistan's official 
authorities will take place soon. What proposals will the 
opposition forces leaders bring to this meeting? 
  [Latifi] Tajikistan's authorities more or less control the 
situation in Dushanbe, but certainly not in the republic as a 
whole. Therefore, a period of transition to stabilization must 
be defined. During this time, in our opinion, a state council of 
national accord should be set up, which will be comprised of 
new, absolutely neutral people. Over the period of two or three 
years they will have to make a tremendous effort to return all 
refugees to the Motherland (about a million people); conduct a 
population census; disarm all--both opposition and 
government--illegal armed formations. And only then draft and 
adopt a new national constitution and conduct elections to the 
supreme bodies of authority. The opposition does not thirst for 
power. All we want is national accord.

<F P=106> [Report by Yelena Dikun: "Islam Karimov--Uncomfortable in a </F>
`Member-Carrier'"] 
  [Text] As reported in the press, Uzbekistan President Islam 
Karimov made an official visit to Moscow last week. Prior to his 
return to Tashkent, Mr. Karimov met with representatives of 
business circles and the Moscow intelligentsia at the Uzbek 
Embassy. The confidential discussion broadened the understanding 
of meeting participants of the current situation in Uzbekistan 
and of its leader. In particular, President Karimov stated... 
<H5>  On Democracy and Democrats </H5>
  The Moscow newspapers are writing a great deal about Karimov 
allegedly using the bugaboo of fundamentalism to protect his 
authoritarianism and policies, about him being a reactionary. 
While at the same time they make no mention of the fact that in 
all of Central Asia it is only in Uzbekistan, in 1991, that 
presidential elections were held with alternative candidates in 
the running. I received 86 percent of the votes at that time, 
while Akayev and Nazarbayev got 98.5 percent. They are referred 
to as democrats, and I--as a postcommunist. 
  When Akayev meets with Americans, he states that Kyrgyzstan 
is the bastion of democracy in Central Asia. Incidentally, had 
Karimov not gone to Kyrgyzstan on the eve of its referendum and 
supported Mr. Akayev, the latter would not have received 96 
percent of the votes. Or consider what is going on in 
Turkmenistan. You see 15-meter statues of the leader with every 
step you take--the likes of which even Stalin did not permit 
himself. We have adopted a Constitution that underwent the most 
exacting expert review in many Western countries. Incidentally, 
the states of West Europe and America follow very closely what 
is going on in Uzbekistan. We have adopted laws on human rights, 
on citizenship, and on elections, that correspond to the norms 
of the democratic states. And we will attain the kind of 
democracy others only dream about. The fact that we are only 
able to do this some time after you have done it is a different 
matter. But I am a practical individual, a realist and 
pragmatic. I therefore often ask myself the question: Why 
inflict harm needlessly? 
<H5>  Purely Personal </H5>
  I will admit that when they received me with full honors 
just 
now in Moscow and then transported me around the city in this 
grand "member-carrier," I did not feel good about it. Why so? 
After all, I have spent 40 years in Moscow and, like any visitor 
who walks, I know it perhaps even better than you. Before, when 
I was an economist and later minister of finance, I used to come 
here at least twice a month on official business with the 
Gosplan [State Planning Committee] and the Ministry of Finance. 
I would run all around the capital then with my briefcase, and 
each time would drop in without fail at Children's World. 
Usually I tried to arrive when the store opened, when there were 
fewer people, and would spend an hour or two here. I was 
familiar with all five floors of the store and knew what was 
sold in each department. After all, I have two little girls and 
I used to bring them everything from here... 
<H5>  On Independence </H5>
  After the Soviet Union collapsed and we became sovereign, 
there was a period of giddiness with us, of euphoria. All of a 
sudden we all felt quite independent. In certain cases this 
independence turned into a fetish and people began to fashion 
grand plans around it. But life is cruel and it quickly 
demonstrated to us that simply declaring independence was not 
sufficient to achieve it. What is the point of sovereignty if 
our children will not live normal lives under it? 
  Recently at an international forum in Davos, I sat next to 
Mrs. Bhutto, Mr. Demirel, Nazarbayev, and my friend the Turkmen 
leader--I forgot his name. Mrs. Bhutto, a strong personality, of 
course, compared to us, brilliantly rattles off English (I feel 
insecure in that I do not know foreign languages, though I did 
study English, German, and French in my time). So she began 
talking about the fact that since there is no Iron Curtain now 
and the Central Asian republics are open, we finally have the 
opportunity to make contacts with one another, integrate, etc. 
When I was in Islamabad I learned that many people there are 
starting to think that Pakistan will now be the leader in the 
region. It is very important, therefore, for us to feel that we 
have something behind us that will impart to us power and might. 
For Uzbekistan this pillar is Russia. He who believes that 
Russia can be written off is mistaken. We in Uzbekistan realize 
that Russia is a great power in every sense of the word. 
<H5>  On Reforms </H5>
  I am an advocate of the reforms Russia is carrying out, and 
I 
fully support them. But we have different methods of attaining 
these objectives. Under our conditions, radical reforms are 
unworkable. Tell me, do we have the right, when 50 percent of 
the population of Uzbekistan are children, who cannot feed 
themselves, to tear everything down to its foundation and then, 
as the revolutionary song goes--"We will build a new world, our 
own world"? If we followed this course in Central Asia, you 
would see an explosion worse than what has occurred in Karabakh. 
You in Russia have gotten too carried away by these reforms and, 
as a result of their forced implementation, you have discredited 
the most noble intentions. But we have found the only proper way 
out--we have operated without "shock therapy" and have not been 
too quick to repudiate the legacy of the past. We have achieved 
a great deal. Whereas the decline of production as compared with 
1989 is somewhere around 46 percent on the average for the 
countries of the former USSR, in Uzbekistan it is 12 percent. 
The drop in national income on the average throughout the 
republics is 34 percent, while in Uzbekistan it is just 6 
percent. In short, our situation is much better than that in 
other regions. 
<H5>  On Barriers </H5>
  We ourselves are inventing a great many barriers today that 
separate us from one another. For example, the expressions "near 
abroad" and "far abroad" have recently come into everyday use. 
These concepts appeared with you in Russia, not with us. Then 
too, it is not entirely clear as to just what criteria are used 
to categorize certain countries with the "near abroad" and 
others with the "far abroad." For example, why is America, with 
whom you have developed fairly warm relations, considered the 
far abroad? 
  In the same manner, I do not really perceive the concept 
"Russian-speaking population." Whom does this term include--just 
Slavic peoples? But then, where do you place me, a person who 
has completed Russian schooling and who speaks Russian? The 
Russian language has always united us--now we seem to be turning 
it into a watershed. 
  Nazarbayev and I resisted right up to the end the departure 
of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan from the ruble zone. I said that 
the most terrible consequence of this step would be the fact 
that millions of people would feel alienated from Russia. And 
this is in fact what happened. Today Belorussia [Belarus] and 
Russia want to create a unified monetary system. I think this is 
proper, but it should not be confined to a union between 
Belorussia and Russia. This garment should be thrown out to all 
the countries of the former USSR.

<F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Stakhov: "They Promise That Businessmen </F>
Will Not Be Shot in Uzbekistan, and That They Will Even Make a 
Good Living"] 
  [Text] Half a year ago the president of a Western company, 
who made almost weekly visits to Moscow and had even opened an 
office here, decided to stop doing business in Russia. "Working 
here is inconvenient, difficult, and dangerous," he explained 
his decision tersely, although he had been making great plans 
just two years ago and had even managed to act on some of them. 
His euphoria soon passed, however, after it had been throttled 
by Russian irresponsibility. 
  Now he sees Moscow as only a transfer point--going from 
Sheremetyevo-2 to Sheremetyevo-1, and from there to Almaty, and 
then back home by the same route in reverse. In Kazakhstan he 
found what he could not find in Russia: a reliable and secure 
foundation for normal business activity. I would not exclude the 
possibility that he and his Western colleagues will now begin 
buying tickets to Tashkent as well. The harsh political climate 
in Uzbekistan unexpectedly turned out to be a favorable 
atmosphere for business. Unprecedented measures are being taken 
in Tashkent to carry out economic reforms, protect private 
property, develop business, and attract foreign investments on a 
broad scale. 
  President I. Karimov did what Moscow had tried and failed to 
do in the reverse order: He began by strengthening his political 
base and then opened the door to the market economy while 
keeping his finger "on the pulse." When Yu. Abdullayev, 
Uzbekistan's ambassador in Moscow, was asked what had made this 
possible, his reply was brief and to the point: "The time was 
right." 
  Judging by the edict the president of Uzbekistan issued on 
this matter, the mechanism of the process itself, which should 
be fine-tuned by various agencies in the next month (a special 
interdepartmental council was established to coordinate their 
work), should assign priority to the legal protection of 
non-governmental property, to administrative penalties and 
criminal liability for violations of the property rights of 
citizens, and to privileges, credits, and state guarantees for 
private owners within the limits specified by the Constitution 
of Uzbekistan. This means that the state will be responsible for 
securing a civilized business climate for those who are 
occasionally shot in Russia with the complete connivance or 
impotence of government officials (to which end the criminal and 
civil codes and other legal instruments in Uzbekistan will be 
supplemented and revised). 
  Apparently, guarantees of this kind are essential before a 
person can start doing business within the territory of the 
former Union and even start taking an interest in economic 
conditions. Tashkent is letting the market faucet run at almost 
full blast. Joint-stock companies of the closed type, for 
example, are to be "opened up." Republic commercial exchanges 
will sell state property slated for privatization and sell stock 
in enterprises undergoing this process. Facilities in the trade 
and service sector and parcels of land may be acquired as 
private property in competitive bidding sessions. Furthermore, 
the bidder will not even be required to declare the source of 
the funds used for the acquisition of property. 
  Existing bureaucratic obstacles in the licensing procedure 
will be eliminated to stimulate business activity. Permits for 
various types of business activity will be issued by seven 
different agencies, including the Ministry of Health and the 
Ministry of Public Education. There will be no restrictions on 
the amount of foreign currency brought into the country or taken 
out of the country by citizens of Uzbekistan and by 
foreigners--unless, obviously, some aspect of the transfer is 
against republic law. 
  The formation of joint ventures for the production of 
consumer goods will also be convenient in Uzbekistan. If the 
foreign share of the capital stock of these joint ventures 
exceeds 50 percent, they will be exempt from the payment of 
taxes on foreign currency receipts and from the obligatory sale 
of part of the foreign currency to the republic Central Bank for 
the first five years. 
  Officials in Tashkent, in contrast to those in Moscow, felt 
it would be counterproductive to "shelter" local producers with 
high import duties and thereby strip the domestic consumer 
market bare. For this reason, customs duties on all but a few 
types of goods will not be charged until 1 July 1995. In 
addition, there are some export quotas, especially on 
foodstuffs. Customs duties on exports will range from 5 percent 
of the contract cost (for cotton fiber or raw silk, for example) 
to 50 percent (mixed feeds, table salt, and matches) and 100 
percent (antiques of cultural value). 
  These rates are temporary, of course, and are certain to be 
reviewed after the improvement of conditions in the food supply 
and several other spheres. 
  One more item on the list of measures connected with 
economic 
reform is extremely important in the establishment of a free 
market. It concerns the host of bureaucrats who are smothering 
the businessmen in Russia. This is why the edict specifically 
stipulates (and we can only hope that this is not a mere 
declaration) that any kind of interference in the finances and 
management of enterprises, establishments, and organizations, 
irrespective of their property status, by the heads of 
administrations and superior administrative bodies will not be 
tolerated, and neither will the creation of various types of 
extra-budgetary funds in rayons and cities with deductions from 
the income of enterprises, establishments, and so forth. 
  The innovations in Tashkent did not escape the notice of the 
West or the East. They are certain to influence economic 
processes in other Central Asian republics, where Tashkent would 
like to consolidate its influence, with the energetic 
encouragement of some rich Muslim countries, primarily Saudi 
Arabia. Karimov's recent trip to Turkey was no coincidence. We 
can assume that the first investments will begin flowing into 
Uzbekistan from Turkey. Karimov got his start in politics, but 
now he wants to win economic victories as well.

<F P=106> ["Edict of the President of the Armenian Republic `On </F>
Measures To Intensify the Fight Against Drug Addiction and Drug 
Trafficking'"] 
  [Text] In order to intensify the fight against drug 
trafficking and drug addiction in the republic and raise its 
effectiveness, in order to make the best use of the resources 
and efforts of bodies and organizations of executive government 
in this sphere, organize their work, and ensure fulfillment of 
the republic's international obligations in the fight against 
drug addiction, I RESOLVE: 
  1. With the purpose of providing organized support to 
coordination of the efforts of ministries, state 
administrations, departments and organizations in the matter of 
drawing up and implementing programs to fight drug trafficking 
and drug addiction, to establish a State Interdepartmental

<F P=106> [Interview with former prime minister and defense minister </F>
Vazgen Manukyan by HAYLUR correspondent Artur Dokholyan; date 
and place not specified] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] 
<H5>  Rule by Triumvirate </H5>
  [Manukyan] [Interview begins with answer as published] 
[Former national security adviser to the president] Ashot 
Manucharyan has always been in the business. Neither his or 
[Minister of the Interior] Vano Siradeghyan's press conference 
was unexpected. This is the logical continuation of domestic 
politics, that is everything that has been done in the country 
in the last few years. 
  When Levon Ter Petrosyan became president, a 
triumvirate--which stood out even within the Karabakh 
Committee--came to power. The triumvirate is: Levon Ter 
Petrosyan, [speaker of the parliament] Babgen Ararktsyan and 
Vano Siradeghyan. It appeared that all the conditions existed to 
unite the people and to implement a state and national policy, 
but that did not happen. On the contrary, everything was done to 
divide the people and to prevent the presence of any independent 
individuals or forces in the country. Meanwhile a wave of 
gossips spread, and mutual accusations, justified or not, began 
to be leveled. 
  Had that triumvirate chosen to pursue national goals, it 
would have taken a different posture. But apparently its main 
goal became to retain power at any cost. Generally, when a group 
wants to retain power without an ideology it tries to mislead 
the people to prevent it from uniting and usually relies on 
armed force to do that. In order to accomplish that it is 
necessary to give an incentive to the armed force so that it 
becomes dependent on and associated with the government. To that 
end the armed force is generally given the right to "plunder" 
(are the quotation marks necessary?) the people. In such 
circumstances, any change of government not only means material 
losses for such a force but also becomes a question of life and 
death, because it has allowed itself that which will never be 
forgiven. In Armenia, the police became that force. From this 
standpoint, I sometimes think that another nation has come and 
conquered our state and our people. Sometimes I think that I am 
living in the days of Mongol rule. 
  Thus what is happening in the country today can be explained 
from this standpoint. Siradeghyan's press conference was one of 
the steps of that policy. Perhaps it was not a very successful 
step, perhaps it could have been taken more subtly as was done 
in the past, but nevertheless the step has been taken. 
Ironically, I see a positive point in all this. This may become 
the last straw which may help or force the public to see or to 
take an interest in what is happening in the government's 
kitchen, to open up that kitchen and to lead to a certain amount 
of housecleaning. This must not be done in the streets and at 
the level of gossiping. It would be appropriate to create a 
multiparty commission of the Supreme Council that includes 
representatives from public organizations and worker unions from 
enterprises. [passage omitted] 
  [HAYLUR] It has been said that this confrontation between 
the 
two branches of government is so dangerous that it may lead to 
civil war. What do you think? 
  [Manukyan] First, I do not see a confrontation between two 
branches of government, because even in the "good days" Ashot 
Manucharyan was part of the second level of government even 
though he had many levers of power in his hand as part of his 
responsibilities. I repeat, it is the triumvirate that is the 
government. Manucharyan is an individual who stood with the 
government, and now he is outside it. 
  As for the prospect of a civil war, I do not see any such 
danger. We, the Armenian nation, are different from our 
neighbors. 
  [HAYLUR] Then, in your opinion, what course may these events 
take? 
  [Manukyan] It is hard to say. In any event, if the 
commission 
I proposed is created and these issues are examined in a normal 
manner, many things will surface. We will learn the kind of 
government we have and what type of government we want to have. 
Also, the people will be able to participate in politics to some 
extent. 
  In the last few years, Armenia did not have real political 
rivalry. Rather there was a practice of gossiping and mutual 
attacks. From that standpoint, we may come out of all this 
cleaner and ensure that political rivalry is waged not through 
gossips or by misleading the people but through extensive 
debates over serious political and economic issues. 
  [HAYLUR] Vano Siradeghyan said during his press conference 
that there were no disagreements between you and Levon Ter 
Petrosyan. He said that it was the "komsomol" wing of the 
Karabakh Committee, led by Ashot Manucharyan, that worked to 
create such disagreements. 
  [Manukyan] Of course we had disagreements, and it is 
ridiculous to think that it was Ashot Manucharyan who created 
them. We did have several disagreements but that is the subject 
of a separate discussion. It is not proper to mix everything 
together. 
  Let me say that from the time of the Karabakh Committee and 
after we became a government I engaged in debates with Ashot 
Manucharyan continually. He and I argued more than anyone else 
in the National Security Council. However, those were all 
debates of a political nature. 
  [HAYLUR] You have accused the government of pursuing an 
antinational policy. You said that the said triumvirate stood 
out even in the Karabakh Committee, that is, even in the 
Armenian Pannational Movement [APM]. You were also a member of 
that Committee. Then you became prime minister and later defense 
minister and controlled certain levers of power. What did you do 
to prevent the said triumvirate from pursuing an antinational 
policy? 
  [Manukyan] At the beginning they probably got together out 
of 
friendship. During the time I was prime minister, they became a 
political force which gained control of a powerful political 
machine, the APM. I must say that they had to mislead certain 
members of the APM to achieve that. Not all of APM was aware of 
that ploy. 
  The office of prime minister was quite burdensome, 
especially 
since we were not prepared to become a government. Of course 
there was a general program of independence, democratization and 
privatization, but, except for these approaches that specified 
general directions, there were no detailed programs. Also we had 
a serious problem of cadres. We had to cope with Armenia's 
economy in those conditions. That took all of my time, leaving 
me no opportunity to focus on the internal politics of the APM. 
<H5>  National Policy </H5>
  [HAYLUR] How would you define or describe what you call 
"national policy"? How do you see the resolution of the Karabakh 
problem? 
  [Manukyan] For many, the word "national" has a mystical 
meaning and appears to be a complex phenomenon. In reality, 
national policy is a very simple concept. For example, the 
conclusion of the Karabakh war is closely tied with the fate of 
our people. I think that if we lose Karabakh we lose, as a 
nation, something much bigger and more important than a few 
thousand square kilometers of land. 
  Of course it is Karabakh that is at war, but what type of 
Armenia stands beside it has a very big significance. This war 
should have been transformed into a pannational war. Indeed, it 
was like that. You recall how the entire nation wanted to help 
and contribute to that liberation struggle. But everything was 
done to ensure that the people stand aside. This is not how one 
runs a national liberation struggle. Transforming that struggle 
into a pannational struggle is a truly national objective. 
Novice government officials think that they can solve this or 
that problem only by state means and that there is no need to 
incorporate the people in policymaking. [passage omitted] 
  When the president of the republic tells the people that 
this 
situation will last for many decades, he is once again pursuing 
an antinational policy. In addition, I do not agree with what he 
says. Also, I do not know any leader of any country who allows 
himself to say something so cynical to his people--especially 
when that does not correspond to the truth and when the only 
purpose of saying such a thing is to justify and to consolidate 
his own rule. 
  [HAYLUR] During his press conference Ashot Manucharyan urged 
the creation of a government of conciliation and described it as 
a coalition of parties, organizations and individuals around a 
prime minister. What do you think about this issue? 
  [Manukyan] I do not find the present structure of 
government, 
in which the president appoints the prime minister and all the 
ministers, very meaningful. During the time Khosrov Harutyunyan 
was prime minister, we had an absurd situation: the prime 
minister did not agree with the government program. When this 
issue was being discussed in the National Security Council, my 
position was that such contradictions may arise again if the 
government is not formed by the prime minister, does not consist 
of a group of people who agree on a common policy and is made up 
of people who are appointed by the president even though they 
have different economic and political views. I proposed to the 
president that, in the future, he submit his candidate for prime 
minister to the Supreme Council for its approval. In that event 
the Supreme Council would be more participatory and more 
responsible. Then let the prime minister appoint the ministers. 
I stated that the president has ample powers even without that 
authority, and that this concession would only help his work. 
But the president did not agree. This is the first point. 
  About the issue of a coalition government: the president of 
the republic is always formally correct on these issues. For 
example, in a recent Supreme Council session he said that if 123 
deputies vote for a bill, it means nothing for him, but if 124 
vote for it then it is a law. From a standpoint of fairness this 
is wrong. The leader of a state that is not fully established 
must be much more careful in expressing such opinions (how many 
voters are there behind 123 deputies?). In other words, this 
issue cannot be treated like chess with its indisputable and 
immutable rules. 
  In France, which has a government structure somewhat similar 
to ours, various mechanisms as well as financial, economic and 
political bodies have been created over many years. If the game 
is played by those rules then it is meaningful. In our 
conditions, when everything is being created from scratch, a 
group of individuals who have risen to power can exploit the 
situation in the absence of other mechanisms and keep the power 
in their hands for decades to come. But if that group has a 
national mentality it must help the creation of those 
mechanisms. The president of the republic must see even the 
development of opposition parties as one of his own objectives. 
That is how high the president of a newly created state must 
stand, instead of doing everything he can to block and break the 
development of mechanisms opposing him. 
  [HAYLUR] Let us generalize and summarize. 
  [Manukyan] I am most distressed by the fact that our nation 
appears to have lost its self-confidence and its faith in its 
own strength. People are leaving this country; they do not 
believe in the future of this state. I think that we can come 
out of this situation. We do not need decades for that; we can 
do it in a very short time. It is possible to achieve peace 
without giving away Karabakh and to develop the economy. 
[passage omitted] 
  [HAYLUR] To do that it is necessary to have a government 
that 
pursues national objectives. Do you think that the present 
government is capable of doing that? If not, what is your 
assessment of the idea of a coalition government which has been 
proposed by the opposition? 
  [Manukyan] I think that this government cannot realize those 
goals, because the people no longer trust it. We already 
discussed the term "national": it means thinking about the 
people and the state, uniting the Diaspora and the entire 
Armenian nation. 
  As for the idea of a coalition government, formally it is 
possible to bring together those parties in the Supreme Council 
whose votes add up to just over half of the total and thus to 
form a government. But in our conditions we cannot pursue that 
path. It would be more natural if the leadership brought 
together representatives of different parties in the government, 
regardless of the number of votes they have in the parliament, 
so that everyone becomes responsible for what is done. I think 
that the time has come to elect a new parliament. We are slowly 
moving toward the practices that determine the internal life of 
a state. In these conditions government leaders are required to 
engage in nonstandard thinking. 
  The people in the most senior positions today did not rise 
to 
those offices with such practices. It would be very dangerous if 
their posture encourages the formation of a movement that 
attempts to change the government by the same methods [that they 
they used]. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Arpi Totoyan: "LRAGIR on Diaspora"] </F>
  [Excerpts] LRAGIR [Newspaper] is the newest daily in 
Armenia's press. The paper began publishing in October 1993 with 
Haykazn Ghahriyan as editor-in-chief and Tadeos Khachatryan as 
editor. At first glance, that is from the standpoint of 
presentation, the paper owes much to artistic editor Artur 
Ghandilyan whose page layout makes the paper attractive. This 
point needs mentioning given that the Armenian press pays little 
attention to page layout which comes on the top of poor paper 
and ink quality which makes their output virtually unreadable. 
  In addition, LRAGIR is one of the few Armenian papers that 
publishes material worth reading. Most papers carry articles 
that often echo anachronistic ideas in a multicolumn format 
which tires the reader. LRAGIR's articles and analyses indicate 
that an effort has been made to keep them brief, a quality that 
is much sought but rarely found in Armenia's papers. With 
serious and independent reporting added to these attributes, one 
gets a daily which has been missed by many for so long. 
  Another factor that distinguishes LRAGIR is that it writes 
about the Diaspora more than any other paper in Armenia. Its 
recent issues in particular (late January and early February) 
carried several articles on the Diaspora. For example, the 
paper's 29 January issue carries an unsigned article entitled 
"The Armenian Diaspora: The Era of Parties is Fading." The 
article subjects the political life of the Armenian diaspora, 
with its organizations, factions and future outlook, to a 
detailed and accurate analysis. [passage omitted] 
  LRAGIR continues its interest in the Diaspora with reports 
about Diaspora assistance to Armenia in its 1 and 2 February 
issues. The first article by Vahe Tondrakyan is entitled 
"Diaspora's Current Assistance to Armenia" and subtitled "Aid 
Declines Steadily." The second article by Hayk Mesropyan is 
entitled "Armenia an International Beggar" and subtitled "The 
Diaspora and Humanitarian Aid." Both article are shorter than 
the political analysis of the Diaspora. The first article 
briefly enumerates the assistance provided by the largest 
Diaspora organizations and says that this aid began with the 
earthquake [of 1988] and has been declining steadily. Tondrakyan 
writes that after creating branches and press organs in Armenia, 
Diaspora organizations thought their work was done. He describes 
assistance by political parties as a "supply of financial and 
technical means for information and press dissemination to their 
sister organizations." 
  Although interesting, the views of the writer are difficult 
to debate in today's conditions. Those views are summarized in 
the following paragraph: "It is becoming steadily clear that the 
Diaspora's assistance to Armenia and the Nagorno-Karabakh 
Republic is only temporary and that in the future it is the 
latter that must help the Diaspora." 
  Hayk Mesropyan's article contains even sharper points. After 
stating that "today Armenia has earned the reputation of being 
an international beggar," he continues with evident bitterness: 
"What is most painful is that our Diaspora brethren also have 
the same disrespectful attitude toward Armenia." [passage 
omitted]

  [Excerpt] We read in today's [Istanbul] CUMHURIYET: 
  In Azerbaijan a pro-government organization has been created 
to wage armed struggle against Armenian expansionism. 
  The organization, called "Anti-Dashnak Organization," held 
its first meeting in Baku yesterday and proclaimed its goals as 
follows: 
  "Our principal objective is to wage a just and armed 
struggle 
against the Armenian Dashnak party [Armenian Revolutionary 
Federation]. As is known this party has resorted to cruel acts 
and has perpetrated genocide against Turkish and Muslim people 
with a fascist mentality and with rigid and uncompromising 
Armenian fanaticism. The Armenians have been perpetrating 
genocide against the people of Azerbaijan for more than 100 
years. They use every opportunity to exterminate hundreds of 
thousands of innocent and defenseless Azeris. Throughout history 
Armenians have repeatedly attacked and tried to seize our lands. 
  "The Anti-Dashnak Organization is determined to stop the 
savagery and massacres by the fanatical Armenians." 
  The statement notes that the headquarters of the 
organization 
is in Baku and that the new group is engaged in extensive work 
to organize across the country. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Azertadzh report on statements at cabinet conference by </F>
Azerbaijan Prime Minister Suret Guseynov: "Results of Last Year 
Discussed"] 
  [Text] Despite the steps taken by the republic 
government last year to stabilize the economy and overcome the 
crisis, the results desired were not achieved. The situation in 
the consumer market continued to be strained, the rate of 
inflation increased, and the public's standard of living 
declined. Participants in the Cabinet of Ministers conference 
under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Suret Guseynov, which 
discussed the results of national economic activity in 1993 and 
the tasks ahead in the current year, arrived at these 
inauspicious conclusions. 
  According to data from the Ministry of Economics, industrial 
production declined by 6.8 percent last year and the volume of 
national income dropped by 13.3 percent compared with 1992. Oil 
production decreased by 800,000 metric tons and natural gas 
production declined by 1 billion cubic meters. The situation in 
agriculture was especially bad; it failed to deliver 21 percent 
of the grain, 43 percent of the vegetables, 59 percent of the 
cotton, and the same amount of grapes to the state. Compared 
with 1992, 34 percent of the meat, 29 percent of the milk, and 
60 percent of the eggs were delivered. 
  The volume of foreign trade turnover was $545.4 million, 
including exports of $325.7 million and imports of $219 million. 
The exports were mainly petroleum products and the imports were 
mostly foodstuffs. It was noted at the same time that strategic 
products continue to be taken out of the republic because of 
lack of supervision by the State Customs Committee and law 
enforcement organs. 
  The economic managers see the following reasons for the 
situation that has taken shape: the imperfect nature of the 
finance and credit system, insufficient capital investments or 
even the complete lack of them, and failure by a number of 
enterprises to complete deliveries in accordance with the 
settlement clearing stipulated by intergovernmental agreements. 
  The head of government expressed his view with respect to 
the 
reasons for the crisis as well. He characterized the price 
liberalization announced 2 years ago and conducted before 
privatization and the land reform as an inexcusable error. In 
his opinion, this also led to an increase in the rate of 
inflation and a budget deficit of 25 billion manats last year, 
as well as the sharp stratification of society, impoverishment 
of most of the people, and excessive enrichment of a small 
proportion of the public. 
  The conference participants were familiarized with the 
Cabinet of Ministers' draft decree giving clear-cut instructions 
to all ministries and departments on putting affairs in order in 
their organizations, as well as on improving the financial 
sitution in the republic. S. Guseynov reaffirmed the 
government's intention to issue a directive on the sale of state 
enterprises' products to commercial structures for a cash 
payment, as well as the collection of taxes from them in cash. 
  He also told the conference participants that the republic 
government, together with the National Bank, is taking steps to 
pay wages, pensions, allowances, and stipends to the public on 
the threshold of the spring vacations. 
  Summing up the conference results, the head of government 
again called upon all managers of economic and financial organs 
in the republic to direct their efforts toward fulfillment of 
the state's targets and normalization of the economic situation 
in the republic.

<F P=106> ["Official statement by the Republic of Azerbaijan MVD </F>
[Ministry of Internal Affairs] Press Service"] 
  [Text] The radical wing of the political opposition, united 
within the framework of the so-called "Karabakh Liberation 
Movement," recently announced its intention to conduct a mass 
action of disobedience in March and to call upon the republic's 
people to revolt against the country's legal leaders. 
  It is necessary to point out that illegal armed formations 
have been one of the main factors destabilizing the situation in 
the republic in recent years, and they have served as an 
implement of violent actions aimed against the state and 
citizens of Azerbaijan. 
  A particularly large quantity of arms were illegally 
distributed to members of the NFA [People's Front of Azerbaijan] 
and other radical organizations when A. Elchibey was president, 
and there is documentary evidence of this. Despite repeated 
appeals by the authorities, only a small part of the arms held 
by them have been returned to the republic's law enforcement 
organs. 
  Taking into account the extreme public danger of calls to 
revolt, which are a threat to Azerbaijan's national security, 
the republic's law enforcement organs have recently stepped up 
their work to confiscate the combat weapons held illegally by 
private individuals. 
  During the course of this work more than 100 firearms, over 
200 explosives and incendiary agents, and 95 bulletproof vests 
and other munitions and equipment have been confiscated from 
various members of the radical opposition. Seven persons have 
been arrested for their illegal possession. An investigation is 
being conducted in connection with the discovery of munitions 
and military gear on the premises of the NFA headquarters; there 
have been no arrests. 
  These actions by the authorities have received the full 
support of the republic's citizens, who are tired of the illegal 
acts and political extremism of the radical opposition. 
  In attempting to whitewash their illegal activity, the 
radical opposition and the mass media controlled by it seek to 
misrepresent the actual course of events and unleash a 
propaganda racket about "repressions" and "persecution" against 
the opposition. 
  Unfortunately, many news agencies have become unwitting 
participants in this deliberate manipulation by disseminating 
unverified information. 
  In this connection, the press service of the Azerbaijan MVD 
has been authorized to state the following. 
  Observance of personal rights and freedoms is a fundamental 
principle in the Republic of Azerbaijan's domestic and foreign 
policy. The authorities' actions to ensure the security of 
citizens, the society, and the state and to confiscate the 
weapons held illegally by extremist and radical groups who call 
for violent actions are aimed at these very objectives. 
Political pluralism and the rights and freedoms of opposition 
organizations are observed to the full extent, and the activity 
within the law by many opposition parties and their mass media, 
which do not pursue extremist objectives or call for violent 
actions, attests to this.

  [Text] The Azerbaijan Government passed a decree on steps 
to implement the protocol on reciprocal deliveries and the 
principles of trade and economic cooperation between Azerbaijan 
and Latvia for 1994, which was signed on 11 January 1994. 
  As an AzerTadzh correspondent was informed by the Cabinet of 
Ministers Press Service, the heads of ministries and 
departments, state committees, companies, concerns, enterprises, 
and organizations have been instructed to take the necessary 
steps to ensure strict fulfillment of deliveries to Latvia 
stipulated by the intergovernmental agreements for 1994. 
  It was stipulated that Latvia will ship products of the 
paper 
and automotive industries, electrical equipment, and consumer 
goods, as well as canned meat, dairy, and fish products, to 
Azerbaijan in 1994. Azerbaijan, in turn, will send petroleum 
products, items turned out by the chemical, metallurgical, and 
electrical engineering industry, and agricultural products to 
Latvia.

<F P=106> [Article by P. Leonov: "You Give Us Collectivization!.."] </F>
  [Text] Perhaps only this way, in true bolshevist 
style, can you evaluate the process of mass circulation of new 
kolkhozes in the republic which has been continued since the 
times of the "glorious" Stalinist five-year plans. 
  If you think about it, our agriculture has been a vast field 
of experimentation. All kinds of experiments were conducted over 
the years! First they consolidated them, then they broke them 
up, then they transformed them into sovkhozes and interkolkhoz 
associations. There was a time when they even cherished the idea 
of creating agrocities. But all these undertakings were 
conceived at the top and implemented in a directive procedure. 
  But the process which has spread over the Azerbaijan 
countryside during our democratic era is not connected with 
government decisions, not obligatory for the lower strata to 
carry out, and not imposed by the will of high authorities at 
all. The initiative began in local areas, and the ones who 
started it were persons who thirst for power and want to prosper 
at the expense of their fellow countrymen: you see, some persons 
were needed right away to become kolkhoz chairmen, surrounding 
themselves with devoted people who dream of cozy homes in 
management, a little farther from the fields and farms. Enticing 
the masses, "activists" have shared their "brilliant" plans, 
painted glowing pictures of economic prosperity, and led them on 
with the ideas of unlimited independence that are in vogue now. 
  This is how the process of breaking up the 
existing kolkhozes and creating new farms in the rayons was 
begun and rapidly accelerated. While there were 608 kolkhozes in 
the republic in 1985, there were 983 when the question of 
decreasing and eliminating them arose in 1990, and there were 
1,175 of them the year after, there are more than 1,200 of them 
today! This means that there are twice as many chairmen and the 
number of management personnel who are not working in productive 
labor in the fields and pastures and on the farms has increased 
accordingly, naturally. Some rayons have been especially 
successful in their yearning for organizational activity. 
Bilyasuvarskiy Rayon now has 22 kolkhozes instead of 13, 
Ismaillinskiy Rayon has 17 instead of eight, Geranboyskiy Rayon 
has 61 instead of 30, Agdzhabedinskiy Rayon has 40 instead of 
24, and Babezhskiy Rayon now has 32 instead of five kolkhozes. 
So many major changes have taken place in a number of rayons in 
just 1 year. 
  Residents of four settlements in Sabirabadskiy 
Rayon--Mugangendzhyali, Dzhengyan, Salmanly, and Tezekend--were 
members of the rather prosperous "Oktyabr" Kolkhoz. After 
promising their fellow countrymen rivers of milk and honey and 
swearing to serve them faithfully, the new candidates for 
chairmen urged the people to vote to divide the kolkhoz that had 
been formed a very long time ago. As a result, each one of the 
villages acquired its own kolkhoz--"Shakhiyar," "Shen Khayat," 
imeni S. Gazanov... 
  Though the efforts of those who aspired to be the leading 
landowners were not crowned with success everywhere. As an 
example, in Belokanskiy Rayon, there are fewer kolkhozes than 
before. 
  I have been told that once they had assumed power, many of 
the new kolkhoz managers rushed to provide themselves with an 
official vehicle and driver for their personal use first of all 
and began construction of a solid building for the kolkhoz board 
with the indispensable main office and hall. A well-equipped, 
spacious, personal farmstead was often quickly built at the same 
time. As a rule, the persons who zealously assisted the 
power-lover to occupy the administrative and economic throne in 
a deserted, downgraded little hamlet were rewarded, depending on 
the extent of their services. 
  But perhaps by taking care of themselves and those close to 
them, the new chairmen were also concerned about kolkhoz 
production?! In most cases, their activity has turned out to be 
deplorable. Let us take Geranboyskiy Rayon, where the kolkhozes 
were broken up so zealously. The average gross production on 100 
hectares of agricultural land in 1992 declined by one-half as 
much compared with 1985. In Bardinskiy and Salyanskiy rayons, 
output also declined by nearly one-half as much during the same 
period. 
  Overall profitability of agricultural production in the 
republic slid from 36 percent in 1980 to 14 percent in 1992. The 
yield of literally all agricultural products has dropped 
sharply, and livestock breeding is in a disastrous state. Even 
cultivation of vegetables has ceased to be profitable on the 
kolkhozes. The figures on the increasing number of unprofitable 
kolkhozes are depressing: there were only four of 
them in 1985, but now there are over 200! 
  Of course, the causes of the agricultural crisis in 
Azerbaijan are deep-seated; it stems from the extremely bad 
state of the economy in general, the break in traditional ties 
among the regions, and the political instability. However, among 
the other reasons, the factor of overall 
fragmentation of the kolkhozes has been very harmful. This 
organizational intrigue has drawn workers away from production 
and left the fields and farms without supervision. The division 
of kolkhoz property has been scandalous in nature at times: each 
of the new formations has strived to seize the arable land that 
is a little better and equipment in a little better condition. 
  I read a letter from the countryside describing the painful 
division of property when a large and prosperous kolkhoz was 
broken up. One obtained a well-equipped repair base, and others 
received tractors and cultivators which needed thorough 
technical maintenance. They distributed few spare parts, and it 
became obvious that none of the sides would benefit from this. 
It turned out that one of the divided kolkhozes had most of the 
cultivators, but two others did not know what to do with 
unneeded agronomists and livestock experts. Bitter, long-lasting 
disputes have broken out concerning who will be responsible for 
the credits taken in preceding years, and to what extent. 
  It is clear that the separated collectives, in addition to 
losing a substantial amount of material resources and often 
deprived of specialists, have not only been unable to achieve 
high labor productivity, but productivity that is barely 
acceptable. Some of these farms that were created artificially 
very quickly became completely bankrupt and incapable 
of providing for even their own local residents. 
  The competence and morality of the kolkhoz chairmen who have 
taken the reins of power lately are another matter. In 1992 and 
the first half of 1993, because of party bias, persons who were 
absolutely incompetent and far removed from agricultural 
production were advanced to positions as kolkhoz managers. Out 
of 18 new chairmen in Geranboyskiy Rayon, 13 have no 
agricultural education. Drivers, medical attendants, 
teachers, librarians, and photographers continue to hold 
positions as chairmen here and there to this day. Kolkhoz 
regulations and the principles of democracy have been rudely 
flouted. 
  Practice such as this has been fertile ground for misconduct 
and provided scope for the princelings to plunder kolkhoz and 
public property. In Kyurdamirskiy Rayon, a clever kolkhoz 
chairman made his 90-year-old sister-in-law the "manager" of a 
cooperative and sold her kolkhoz motor vehicles, a tractor, and 
a water pump at bargain prices; the building for a machine shop, 
a transformer, and a bath house were transferred to her without 
charge. The kolkhoz "let the cooperative have" 150 sheep at 
little cost. Dozens of hectares of land suitable for cultivation 
were dispensed left and right. And the creator of this self-rule 
got away with it. 
  Many of the kolkhoz members who sincerely believed in the 
advantage of breaking up the kolkhozes or who were deceived as 
careerists and mercenary-minded individuals would not mind 
reuniting the separated farms today. In Imishlinskiy and 
Geranboyskiy rayons, six kolkhozes were consolidated and gained 
as a result. But on the whole, it is not simple to put the 
prevailing trend of possession in reverse. The managers of farms 
in local areas do not intend to part with the positions which 
provide them with an incredible salary, the opportunity to 
command, and all kinds of privileges. 
  And it is hard to engage in organizational restructuring 
once 
again, especially in our troubled time. 
  The number of kolkhozes in the republic has increased partly 
because a number of unprofitable sovkhozes in mountainous areas 
were turned into kolkhozes. The state left its burden to the 
rural residents and firmly proceeded to change the form of 
ownership. But the unprofitable sovkhozes were not turned into 
profitable kolkhozes for the most part, and this has given 
persons an additional reason to maintain that kolkhozes in 
general, no matter whether they are large or small, have become 
obsolete and they have clearly shown that they are unsound. 
  Such categorical conclusions are not likely to be urgent 
these days, when we are entering the market little by little 
with huge and obvious losses, where privatization is only shown 
by a dotted line, and the triumph of private property is still a 
long way off. 
  In the current segment of history with its distinctive 
contradictions and the cataclysms and extraordinary burdens for 
the people, it is important to retain and make use of all 
forms of ownership with the most possible benefit for 
society and to efficiently utilize the best that is 
incorporated in the kolkhozes. Casting aspersions on them 
without making distinctions and rejecting a differentiated 
approach would be an irreparable error. In accordance with our 
old custom, the kolkhozes are still being commanded from 
without, their free access to the market is being impeded, and 
excessive taxes are being imposed on them. 
  I was told an interesting fact at the Kolkhoz Affairs Main 
Administration of the Ministry of Agriculture. Livestock 
raising, and milk production in particular, is unprofitable for 
kolkhozes in the republic as a whole. Kolkhozes have been 
compelled to give milk to the state dairy plants at a sharply 
understated and "very ludicrous" price. But in Imishlinskiy 
Rayon, one of the kolkhozes was authorized to sell milk freely 
as an exception. As a result, in less than a month, selling milk 
in the market at 70 manats [unit of currency] per liter in 
January, the kolkhoz earned more than in the entire year of 
1993! And the cash was most welcome to the kolkhoz. 
  It is hard to tell what will happen to the separated 
kolkhozes now. I think in each specific case we have to be 
extremely careful and cautious not to resort to severe 
administrative pressure, to appeal to people's intellect and 
aspirations first of all, and to encourage and support their 
sense of economic expediency in every possible way.

<F P=106> [AzerTadzh report: "The Production Recession Continues"] </F>
  [Text] The stabilization of the economy being forecast this 
year has not begun yet, judging by the results of the first 
month. According to data provided by the republic's Goskomstat 
[State Committee for Statistics], the decline in industrial 
production in January, compared with the same period last year, 
was recorded at 11.3 percent. 
  The situation was worse in practically all sectors. 
  The situation in agriculture is even less comforting. 
  The production of automotive gasoline was increased 
somewhat. 
But against the background of nearly universal economic decline, 
the situation in the wine and vodka sector was especially 
heartening. Production of alcoholic beverages was nearly doubled 
compared with January 1993. 
  As far as prices are concerned, they rose by nearly 10 times 
as much during the year, but the average wage rose by just 4.3 
times as much. It was 4,600 manats in January 1994. 
  The principal reasons for the production decline and the 
worsening economic situation, according to the analysis cited by 
the republic's Goskomstat, are the critical shortage at 
enterprises of raw material and materials because of their 
higher prices and enterprises' failure to make payments.

"Why Is Meat Rising in Price?"] 
  [Text] Yevlakh--The situation in livestock raising has 
become quite strained lately, as we know. Of course, the sector 
can be revived once and for all only after the occupied 
territories are liberated. But is there a possibility the 
situation can be at least alleviated somehow? 
  "I think we can," said F. Aliyev, director of the Yevlakh 
combine. He stressed that the economic ties that were broken 
with partners in the near abroad must be restored to overcome 
the crisis. 
  In past years, Agdam and Yevlak provided mixed feed to 
livestock raising farms not only in Karabakh, but several dozen 
other rayons in the republic as well. Various components came 
from 20 cities in the former union republics--from special salt, 
chalk, and cottonseed meal to oats and fodder grain--to turn out 
the finished product. 
  It has now been several years since the stabilized ties with 
suppliers were broken. Moreover, we cannot count on the Agdam 
combine for the present. And the production volumes in Yevlakh 
are now being measured in just hundreds of metric tons, not 
thousands. While mixed feed of five varieties was turned out 
here before, only one form of the product--a feed mixture from 
local raw material--is being prepared and delivered to the farms 
now. 
  My interlocutor is undoubtedly right. But on the other hand, 
the repeated increase in prices for deliveries from the near 
abroad cannot be disregarded, either. Consequently, the prices 
for mixed feed will rise as well. Accordingly, the livestock 
raisers will be selling their product at a higher price. 
  Well, it is possible that this is only the first stage in a 
solution of the problem--achieving definite saturation of the 
market for livestock products. And as far as the future is 
concerned, we have to ensure that prices for meat, milk, and 
dairy products are at least stabilized, if not quickly lowered. 
It is up to the market.

<F P=106> [Interview, under the rubric "Topical Interview," with Umud </F>
Umudovich Melikov, director of the Baku Asbestos Cement and 
Ceramic Items Combine, conducted by P. Leonov; date and place 
not given] 
  [Text] The director of the Baku Asbestos Cement and 
Ceramic Items Combine, U. Melikov, answers the questions of the 
BAKINSKIY RABOCHIY correspondent. 
  [Leonov] Everyone needs the output which you produce, I dare 
say: state and cooperative organizations, joint enterprises, and 
individual citizens. Slate, Dutch tile, ceramic tile, and 
sanitary equipment are necessary for construction, repair, and 
everyday life. So why is it that we never have enough of them in 
our country, and how do things stand now? 
  [Melikov] Even in the best times the republic supplied 
itself 
with only 30-40 percent of these materials and the rest of the 
output had to be obtained outside its borders. Even though our 
combine's capacity, according to accepted standards, is fairly 
large and it used to increase every year. But the disruption of 
inter-enterprise regional ties threatened the combine's very 
existence. The unified national economic complex which was 
formed in the past had its indisputable pluses and its enormous 
minuses. The administrative system could not handle the problems 
of long distance hauling, dependence on suppliers from other 
cities, and the marketing of finished items. In accordance with 
the program worked out at the top, our enterprise received 
almost all its raw and processed materials from outside. And 
those materials included up to 70 types of raw materials, 
industrial cloth strainers for manufacturing slate, and spare 
parts. This practice hampered initiative in local areas, created 
feelings of dependence, and hindered the search for and 
development of deposits of various types of raw materials right 
in our republic, which is rich in various kinds of natural 
resources. Now all this has also had a very negative effect on 
production. Judge for yourselves how nepheline is obtained in 
the city of Apatity, which is on the Barents Sea, and asbestos 
in the Urals and in the Kazakh city of Dzhezgazgan, firebrick in 
the Donbass, and ceramic paints in Voronezh! That is the 
reason for the disruptions in the combine's work, the forced 
downtime, and the drop in production of output. Now, for 
example, the slate shop is idle. We are trying to rectify the 
situation and reduce the enterprise's dependence on imported raw 
materials. Along with the sectorial concern and the Building 
Materials Institute, we are seeking particular types of raw 
materials in Azerbaijan and organizing their extraction and 
delivery. We have organized a cooperative engaged in working a 
local deposit of perlite; in Shamkirskiy Rayon and on the 
Sumgayytchay River we are creating production sections for 
exploiting deposits of clay. The quality of the clay, as it 
happens, is altogether suitable for producing superior Dutch and 
ceramic tiles. This will reduce the pressure for supplying clay 
from outside. There are also experiments underway on local 
quartz sand, deposits of which used to be ignored. Dzhebrailskiy 
Rayon will be completely liberated from the aggressor, and from 
there we will be able to obtain volcanic ash used to manufacture 
ceramic tiles. We have also adapted to the use of Karadagskiy 
cement, instead of cement from Volgograd. Work in this direction 
will be continued with increasing intensity. But even so, for 
now and in the foreseeable future the combine will be unable to 
operate successfully without close cooperation with partners 
from other republics of the former USSR. However, considerable 
difficulties of an objective and subjective nature put us on 
guard here. 
  [Leonov] Most likely, first questions of mutual accounts 
with 
suppliers and customers, questions of payments. A lingering, 
serious illness common to many people! 
  [Melikov] Within the republic, in the manat zone the 
situation with payments is relatively favorable. Overall banks 
are duly handling the transfer of money. True, sometimes, and 
not so very rarely, there are delays. For example, money takes 
half a month or even more to get from Salyany to Baku. At times 
one gets the impression that the banks hold back the capital for 
their own commercial transactions, since loaning it out and 
charging interest is profitable. We do not have Russian rubles, 
so we use barter in relations with suppliers from the CIS 
countries. We settle accounts with our own finished output as 
well, especially sanitary equipment and other items produced in 
Azerbaijan which enjoy stable demand. But today it is very 
difficult to cooperate with suppliers, Russian, Ukrainian, 
Kazakh, Central Asian, and Georgian. The world has a golden 
rule: everything that is not forbidden is permitted. In our 
country, with almost every step of economic activity, we 
encounter all kinds of obstacles, bureaucratic barriers and red 
tape, acutely painful formalism, innumerable derivative legal 
enactments, and arbitrary instructions and circulars. Any 
transaction has to be reconciled with higher levels, even the 
Cabinet of Ministers, and permission must be obtained from them. 
  As a result, valuable time is lost, you must endure damages, 
and you may lose the supplier or the client. We reached 
agreement with our colleagues from Georgia that they would give 
us 26 railroad carloads of raw materials, perlite, and in 
exchange we would give them 9 carloads of our own output, slate. 
Our neighbors efficiently fulfilled their obligation. After a 
long ordeal, we managed to ship out only two carloads of slate. 
The documents for the other cars are wandering from office to 
office and the authorities are in no hurry to give the "go 
ahead." Lost days also mean lost money and additional troubles: 
we have to conclude the contract all over again, because of 
higher prices. 
  Business ties with producers from the near abroad are 
complicated by the overly suspicious customs service. Customs by 
no means wanted to allow in the ceramic balls which are used in 
the technological process and came to us from Russia. We had to 
spend a long time proving that these balls were not suitable for 
other purposes. 
  I have been in Turkey and Czechia more than once, and, I 
must 
confess, I have watched with envy how quickly and freely, 
without bureaucrats' intervention, major deals are concluded 
there, financial transactions are conducted, and the transport 
of freight within the state and hundreds or thousands of 
kilometers from it is carried out. 
  [Leonov] Umud Umudovich, this is not the first year that as 
an administrator with a respectable record and an experienced 
specialist, you have headed an asbestos cement and ceramic items 
combine, for before this you managed the Karadagskiy Cement 
Plant, the Baku Glass Plant, and the Baku Building Materials 
Combine. Tell us what, in your opinion, must be done so that 
domestic sanitary equipment and our output earmarked for 
construction and domestic needs will meet world standards and be 
competitive on the international market. For it is no secret 
that local items suffer badly in comparison with those foreign 
models which are now sold in commercial stores at exorbitant 
prices. 
  [Melikov] In terms of price, our items are on the average 
one-tenth as expensive, but outwardly they are at a disadvantage 
in most cases. A number of things are to blame for that. I dare 
to reassure you that the thousand-member collective of our 
combine is very skilled and people are able and try to produce 
contemporary, high quality output and raise production volumes. 
But the forced stoppages of technological lines have a 
by-no-means good effect on their work. As I already said, our 
slate shop has been down for a week because there is no 
asbestos, which comes from the Urals. We have the very same 
unfortunate problem with payments! Problems of supplying raw and 
processed materials take up too much time and energy. We managed 
to get several carloads of hardware for sanitary-porcelain items 
from outside, and we were lucky: we have enough of it for 2 
years. Gypsum delivered from Samara allows us to manufacture 
better quality output. Under the present particular conditions, 
it is fairly difficult to procure good paints, which is what the 
quality of Dutch tiles largely depends upon. 
  A substantial part of our equipment has become obsolete, and 
that includes equipment bought at one time in Italy and Germany; 
that also affects quality. You cannot get spare parts from the 
far abroad now. We are resourceful and make do with our own 
efforts and hire Baku machine building plants. Units for 
producing asbestos cement sewer pipes were installed at the 
combine back in the 1940s. There is a great need for these 
pipes, but we have had to shut down production. The equipment 
was so worn out that it did not meet the elementary norms of 
equipment safety. And, besides, it is intolerable to use 
primitive "sledge hammer" technology in our time! The maximum 
diameter of the asbestos cement pipes produced on this line 
equaled 1 meter 200 centimeters, while these days Italy is 
manufacturing equipment intended to produce pipes up to 3 meters 
in diameter. We spend 48 hours to fire each batch of porcelain 
items in the kilns. These kilns belong to the past, since in 
enterprises similar to ours abroad there are kilns where firing 
lasts not 48 hours but 24 or even 12 hours. 
  We do not have the hard currency to acquire the latest 
foreign equipment, but we hope in the future to sign a mutually 
advantageous agreement with foreign firms which are managing 
construction of prestigious projects in Azerbaijan. Is it 
reasonable for them to bring Dutch and ceramic tiles and 
sanitary equipment from afar if they can get them at our combine 
equipped, with their help, with contemporary, high technology 
lines?! 
  But even so, despite the difficulties already named, the 
collective is managing to raise the quality of our output. We 
are manufacturing pretty two-tone Dutch tiles and various kinds 
of attractive designs are being added to the surface of the 
tiles at the decal section. "Tyulpan" [tulip] basins for 
bathrooms done in light blue, pink, and other colors come off 
the conveyor. We have also changed over to producing more 
convenient models of other sanitary equipment. The enterprise's 
chief engineer, Meymat Guseynov, and the laboratory chief, Tagir 
Gadzhiyev, set the tone in the work to refine production and 
incorporate new models. Incidentally, last year by common 
efforts we managed to produce many more improved 
sanitary-porcelain items than was planned. 
  [Leonov] It has become a common and unfortunate occurrence 
that skilled workers leave state enterprises, which are in 
turmoil, to go to all kinds of commercial structures where 
earnings are higher and more reliable. Tell us, please, how 
could you avoid the exodus of cadres and preserve the main 
backbone of specialists? 
  [Melikov] I would like to have seen the results of the last 
year more impressive, but we kept profitability at the level of 
15 percent and obtained pure profit of 411 million rubles. The 
average monthly earnings in January of this year reached 8,000 
manats. As before we continue to handle housing construction for 
our employees. Last year a 10-story housing block with 100 
apartments was occupied, and in the first quarter of this year 
another residential building with 50 apartments will be ready. 
It has been decided to build a third building in shares with 
Glavbakstroy [Main Construction Administration of Baku]. We 
supply our own people with agricultural products at reduced 
prices, subsidize the cost of lunches in the enterprise's 
cafeteria, and opened a shop to bake bread on the combine's 
territory. Special attention is lavished on the families of our 
industrial workers who with weapons in their hands protect our 
native land. 
  And overall people treasure their own enterprise to which 
they are closely linked. 
  I think that all these factors certainly serve as a response 
to the question posed.

minister of press and information, conducted by unnamed 
Khabar-servis Agency correspondent; date and place not given: 
"Mass Information Media Need Governmental Support"] 
  [Text] "If the situation does not change, it will soon 
become even more difficult to put out republic newspapers and 
journals," said the minister of press and information, Sabir 
Rustamkhanly, in an interview with a correspondent of the 
Khabar-servis Agency. Even now many printed publications in 
Azerbaijan come out very late, and some have ceased to exist 
altogether. Editorial offices are in dire need of capital to buy 
metallic plates which are essential in the printing process, the 
price of paper rises every day, and many press organs are unable 
to handle these problems on their own. 
  In S. Rustamkhanly's opinion, there is only one solution to 
the situation which has developed--financial support of 
publications, including independent ones, from the government. 
He emphasized that slightly more than a million dollars a year 
are needed to buy everything necessary. "The leadership of 
Azerbaijan must be clearly aware that a normally operating 
`fourth estate' is an enormous help in the cause of state 
construction," S. Rustamkhanly stated in conclusion.

<F P=106> [Article by M. Akhundlu: "There Is No Peace on the Border: </F>
Notes from an Expanded Meeting of the Border Troops Directorate 
of the Azeri Republic Ministry of National Security"] 
  [Text] The Azeri Republic Ministry of National Security 
border troops serve their duty in complex operational 
conditions. As was already reported, during combat actions 
Armenian armed formations reached the Azeri-Iranian border and 
now a significant part of Azeri territory is under their 
control. Tens of thousands of refugees from regions occupied by 
the enemy are also concentrated on the border. This diverts 
personnel from their primary duties, and border troops are 
participating in combat operations, distributing humanitarian 
aid coming from the Iranian side, and conducting scheduled 
activities in regions where camps for refugees in the border 
zone are located. 
  Special difficulties in serving on the border arise from the 
incompetence of personnel at the military posts of Dzhalilabad 
and Yardymly, where frequent attempts are made to cross the 
border and bring in contraband. 
  The border in the Geytepe section is not being guarded 
properly. Smuggling and the driving of livestock to the 
neighboring country often occur under the "patronage" of certain 
associates of state and law enforcement organs and soldiers. 
  A difficult situation has taken shape on the northern 
borders 
of our republic. Last year certain leaders of the Dagestan 
society Sadval intended to create tension in this zone and 
resorted to direct provocation. Thus, someone with the nickname 
of Alik from time to time approached the Samur post at 
Yalaminskiy Checkpoint with his detachment and using firearms 
tried to provoke a confrontation and threatened the Azeri border 
troops. As it became clear, this group is closely linked to 
associates of the militsia and GAI [State Automobile Inspection] 
of Magerramkentskiy Rayon, which adjoins our republic. More than 
once militsia associates on Dagestan's territory have beaten up 
drivers of motor vehicles going from Azerbaijan to the Russian 
Federation. 
  One might say the measures which our republic's leadership 
is 
taking to resolve the problems of the local Lezghin population 
are to some extent reducing tension. But the situation on the 
northern border of Azerbaijan also depends to a considerable 
extent on the actions of criminal elements who are sowing 
hostility among our peoples. The rayon public should take a 
stand here and rebuff the provocations. 
  Last year about 3,000 people tried to cross the border with 
Iran. They were citizens of Turkey, Ukraine, Afghanistan, 
Azerbaijan, and Iran. More than 13 million rubles and about 1.5 
million manats, 3 million rials, 45,000 U.S. dollars, hundreds 
of head of cattle, sheep, and goats, firearms, cartridges, 
narcotics, and tonnes of aluminum and copper were confiscated 
from offenders. All this was discussed at the expanded meeting 
of the republic Ministry of National Security's Border Troop 
Directorate. 
  As was noted at the meeting, the benefit from the border 
troops could be more appreciable if military discipline were 
more carefully observed at military posts and officers and 
soldiers were more vigilant, honest, and professionally trained. 
The fact that during the year 100 officers and warrant officers 
were discharged from the border troops for various violations is 
also alarming. 
  And 1994 will not be a simple one for the border troops 
either, and a number of proposals to step up the Directorate's 
activity and raise the professional attributes of personnel were 
adopted at the meeting.

"It Is No Good To Read a Burial Service for Democracy"] 
  [Text] The failure of democratically oriented forces 
during the December elections clearly marked an event, whose 
signs they could have detected earlier if they had not been so 
busy fighting their implacable opposition and explaining their 
relationships with each other. The increase in the citizens' 
social anxieties and dissatisfaction with the state of affairs 
in the country and the drop in their political activity were 
occurring during all of last year. After the October events 
ended the democrats' ideological and political offensive against 
Soviet communist totalitarianism, Russian society, which was 
released from the hypnotic influence of the conflict between the 
branches, called into question the doctrine proposed by the 
democratic reformers for building a new Russia. 
<H5>  Where Are We Going? </H5>
  It is not worthwhile hurrying to read a burial service over 
Russian democracy. It is alive; however, it is, without a doubt, 
living through difficult times. Judging by everything, a 
political recoil began after the spurt forward. The speed of the 
communist system's disintegration greatly determined its energy. 
What will be its strength and where will it lead all of us? One 
must understand whether one ought to attempt only to slow its 
backward movement and make its consequences as painless as 
possible or whether democracy will preserve sufficient 
potential, requiring only adjustments in its adopted course. 
What should these adjustments be? The answer to this question 
will greatly depend on appraisals of Russian society's condition 
and on the choice which the democrats themselves must make. Let 
us begin with the first item. 
  When the Democratic Russia activists, who were painfully 
shocked by the results of the December elections, assembled to 
urge the people to unite in a popular antifascist front, 
disappointment awaited them. It became clear almost immediately 
that they would be alone. The liberals, communists and even part 
of the democrats came out sharply against this proposal -- as a 
confrontational one fraught with a new escalation in the 
conflict. They said that such an action would provoke an upsurge 
in fascism rather than stopping it. The liberal environment 
again said that "communofascism" is a myth but it could become a 
reality if the reformers do not change their course and the 
"demorussians" do not stop calling people to the barricades. 
  Nevertheless, the decisive argument against an antifascist 
front at the present time was not this but rather the feeling 
that one would not succeed in arousing the people to active 
political actions. The people were tired from the endless 
conflicts and from politics, in general, and have lost their 
trust in it. That is why the idea of a front was quickly 
transformed -- first, into an antifascist movement and, later, 
into the draft of a "New Civic Movement" that would have the 
strategic purpose of building a civic society and insuring a 
peaceful process for reforming Russia. Opposition to fascism was 
only one of the movement's tasks. 
  Thus, the change in policy was caused by the recognized 
necessity to rethink the condition of Russian society and, 
correspondingly, its goals and tasks. This is really something 
to think about. 
<H5>  "The Democrats Have Messed Everything Up" </H5>
  This popular curse was born in the pro-communist opposition 
under the influence of the USSR's collapse and the price 
liberalization. It has now acquired the meaning of an 
ideological evaluation of democracy in Russia by the entire 
implacable opposition. Much is concealed in this evaluation: 
complaints about the sharp dramatic changes in the country, 
irritation caused by the burdens of day-to-day existence, doubts 
about the correctness of the course adopted by the reformers and 
the value of democratic freedoms, and preservation of the strong 
influence of the former soviet and party nomenklatura in the 
central state apparatus and local bodies of power and economic 
structures. A wave of united antidemocratic opposition is rising 
on such sentiments. Great-power nationalism, the idea of a 
self-contained state elevated above society and maintaining 
authoritative order in it, and a policy of blocs and 
confrontations in international politics are more and more 
becoming its common foundation. 
  How far can the recoil go in this direction if an effective 
counteraction is not found for it? It is understandable that the 
best method would be successful implementation of the economic 
reforms, into which Russian society has already been drawn 
rather deeply and, as they say, the "active construction of a 
civic society." Perhaps, however, the latter is not quite what 
is needed and it is better to carry out the reforms under 
conditions of "enlightened authoritarianism?" This viewpoint is 
expressed just as frequently as the liberal romantic idea, which 
is contrary to it, of absolute evil coming from the state 
executive branch before which both the fascists and the 
"communofascists" are indeed only one of those defending the 
"sprouts of democracy" and not an alliance of extremist 
pro-communist and ultranationalist forces. Who is right? 
<H5>  The Fuss About the "Social Pie" </H5>
  It is difficult, of course, for the democrats to convince 
people not to identify them with a corrupt bureaucratic state 
since they, failing to control it effectively, have taken upon 
themselves moral responsibility for everything in the country. 
However, it is important to state clearly what we are dealing 
with today. 
  First, the state has not remained unchanged since 1991. As 
the radicalism of market reforms weakened and the administrative 
regulating role of the state was made more active, it settled 
more and more on its apparat-bureaucratic base and the role of 
branch lobbying in distributing the scarce -- as before but now 
not only physical resources but also money resources, grew at 
the same time. Accordingly, the danger of returning to the 
system of "bureaucratic trading" for a disproportionately large 
share of the diminishing "public pie" grew stronger. In the 
final analysis, this was the undoing of the centralized Soviet 
economy. The fact that the leadership and lobbyists of the 
branch monopolies are implementing such an egging-on revenge not 
only by penetrating into the leading cabinets but also by 
actively supporting the proletarianized masses of workers, 
including the strike movement, is now new. This "swing" in 
society is fraught with two terrible threats -- the inflationary 
collapse of the entire economy and a political explosion capable 
of returning the country to "war communism" and reaction. 
  Second, despite a presence everywhere in society, the state 
has nevertheless surrendered its positions to a great extent. 
This is having extremely painful consequences since society 
itself is weakly structured socially and politically. As a 
result of numerous post-revolution shocks (wars, class struggle, 
collectivization, massive migrations) to the Russian social 
consciousness, the natural social ties -- family, kinsmen, 
community, fellow countrymen, etc. -- which firmly bound him for 
centuries, were destroyed to a great extent. At the same time, 
modern social structures based on a compromise and mutually 
beneficial agreement about non-converging class interests were 
not strengthened. 
  During the Soviet epoch, a totalitarian state performed this 
cementing role in Russia. Now, however, this system has greatly 
eroded, leaving society in an atomized condition. As a result, a 
phenomenon of duality arose in the relationship of the modern 
Russian to the state: his striving to free himself from the 
administrative limitations of labor activity and use, on the one 
hand, and the simultaneous wish to preserve for himself a system 
of all-round state social paternalism, on the other hand. This 
duality and not just the resistance of the former "party, soviet 
and economic aktiv" is playing a role in braking the political 
reforms of B. Yeltsin and the market reforms in the spirit of 
Ye. Gaydar. Nevertheless, the reforms must move forward -- but 
how? 
<H5>  Who Is Right? </H5>
  Many points of view exist regarding the course of economic 
reforms: the government's, Ye. Gaydar's, Shatalin-Abalkin's, 
Yavlinskiy's, etc. Although the president in his message to the 
Federal Assembly confirmed the course of the reforms in its 
basic principles and Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin made a 
completely moderate and balanced statement about ways to adjust 
it, arguments have become even sharper. What is the trouble? 
  This problem has many aspects. In any event, however, the 
main thing that should interest everyone is how to make a 
correct choice and understand what specifically divides the 
participants in the controversy. Here, something is beginning to 
be cleared up. 
  Ye. Gaydar, having given the economy money in the form of 
genuine economic resources instead of the previous account 
assets, was not able, according to the unanimous opinion of his 
opponents, to demonstrate how he could combine structural 
reorganization with an acceptable level of unemployment and the 
preservation of high-tech production. He himself, however, 
continues to think that his economic experiment would have 
brought total success if it had not been interrupted half-way. 
It seems that the large amount of negative experience that he 
acquired in the government is the source feeding his 
persistence. Gaydar understood, in practice, that the main 
problem of the reforms was how to force the branch monopolies to 
move to structural changes and where to get money and time to 
make this process as painless as possible in the economy (a 
decline and structural disproportions) and in the social area 
(unemployment). 
  Of course, the figures of the branch lobbyists, by whose 
efforts and the efforts of part of the government's bureaucracy 
it would be possible to throw the economy suddenly back into the 
chaos of the administrative market economy of the past -- but 
now with even greater pernicious consequences -- constantly 
stood before his thoughtful gaze. That is why he regards -- not 
without skepticism -- V. Chernomyrdin's adjustment ideas since 
they have not been stated completely clearly (yes, and wisely; 
this should have been done immediately) since mutually 
contradictory tasks of supporting existing production, 
struggling against inflation and carrying out market 
institutional reforms are linked together in his program 
although the general idea of adjusting economic policy is 
completely understandable. 
  This deficiency in the government's plan is seemingly 
overcome in the Shatalin-Abalkin program, which proposed a 
definite mechanism for producing a correlation of prices and 
wages in the national economy in a rational system and also for 
executive support of key branches by the state. Trust in the 
program, however, is undermined by the stubborn unwillingness of 
its authors to recognize the positive meaning of Ye. Gaydar's 
replacement of administrative levers for managing the economy 
with market ones. That is why the danger exists that the 
measures proposed by them can, in the final analysis, be a 
mirror anti-market image of a radical monetarist approach. 
Instead of the slogan: "Suppress inflation at any cost," the 
slogan: "Support a certain level of social appropriations, 
prices and wages at any cost," will be put forward -- with the 
threat of rolling back to an economy of shortages. 
  The reform version proposed by G. Yavlinskiy with its stress 
on implementing a harmonious schema for state regulation of the 
process of subsequently transforming the former Soviet economy 
into a normal market one is seemingly deprived of this defect. 
At first glance, it looks effective as a competitor not for the 
"Gaydaronomics" of the past two years but for possible other 
"post-Gaydaronomic" approaches, using its positive results and 
not only its corrected failures. The main problem, however, with 
this program (as with all G. Yavlinskiy's previous works at the 
macro level) is, in his own words, that it requires preliminary 
changes in political conditions -- at a time when the main 
problem is the establishment of a program for actually existing 
social and political conditions. 
<H5>  A New National Idea </H5>
  It is clear that the way to transform the former Soviet 
totalitarian society into a civic one runs through the failures 
of its atomization and archaicization. That is why it is no 
accident that the president's message especially stressed the 
need to strengthen the state's role in forming civic society's 
institutions. The political conditions are not quite favorable 
for this despite the strong drop in the popularity of the 
democrats and democracy and the collection of opponents. 
  From this viewpoint, it is worthwhile to look at the case of 
the DemoRussians' recent advancement of the concept of a "New 
Civic Movement," which is designed to unite public, political, 
social, and other non-political movements of a civic persuasion. 
An increase in understanding the mutual connection between the 
struggle for the democratization of the state apparatus, the 
uniting of all pro-reform forces, the establishment of 
mechanisms for the citizens' effective influencing of the 
authorities and protection of their everyday interests by them, 
and, finally, the suppression of reactionary political trends 
are important new phenomena in the democratic movement.

  [Text] 
<H5>  Carte Blanche </H5>
  Arguments concerning the precedence of politics over 
economics and vice versa have been conducted since time 
immemorial and, moreover, with particular fury in periods of 
social troubles and a search for ways to get out of them. The 
present catastrophic situation in Russia and in the space of the 
former USSR naturally placed this argument at the center of 
endless discussions on the centuries-old Russian question: "What 
is to be done?" And it seems that it is already not so much 
these discussions as it is life itself that answers this 
question unambiguously: It is necessary with any measures, right 
up to extreme ones, to save the economy, and to restore and to 
develop production at a high tempo, which alone can now 
extricate the country from the slough of monstrous inflation. 
  This crying voice of real life is heard by all, but in very 
different ways. And this does not at all depend on the extent of 
common sense, professionalism, and people's civic 
responsibility, but rather on their specific vital interests, 
which are determined by social position and social inclination. 
And, according to the letter of scientific truth, the ideology 
of different social forces and a policy that corresponds to it 
express these interests in a concentrated way. 
  At all times those tendencies and processes dominate the 
economy in any country that responds most of all to the 
interests of the social stratum or class that has a decisive 
influence on the character of state authority and, consequently, 
on its policy. Of course, all of this is political science 
prescriptions. But, unfortunately, through the efforts of 
certain interested social circles during the years of 
perestroyka and reforms, such a chaos of ideas and categories 
was created that people now have difficulty distinguishing red 
from white and brown, and left from right. As for the usual 
"isms," they are anathematized and even declared nonexistent in 
the modern life of humanity. Meanwhile, the "civilized world," 
which is dear to the heart of our perestroyka supporters and 
reformers, persistently calls its society capitalistic (but the 
main thing is it considers it to be capitalistic), ignoring the 
lamentation of our Marxist-Leninists that somewhere just "over 
the hill" genuine socialism is blossoming. But God will be their 
judge. But this is not what the question is now. 
  It is about something else--about the correlation of 
political and economic concerns of our Russian authorities. Only 
a blind person may not see that they are working most of all on 
problems of self-reinforcement. This is its highest and truly 
vital priority today. The economy as such and the distress of 
the people is of interest to them only to the extent they do not 
prevent them from concentrating efforts precisely on this 
priority. But its reliable guarantee consists first of all on a 
rapid expansion of social support of the authorities in the form 
of important entrepreneurs and numerous small and average 
knights of profit who will staunchly defend their just acquired 
"beautiful life" and a government that opens the way for them to 
such a life. Hence, the destructive pace and scales of 
privatization of the economy of the country, and hence the 
almost unlimited scope for the purchase and sale of all and 
everything for the enrichment of the leaders of the excessively 
growing bureaucratic apparatus. 
  But, of course, in trying to entrench themselves forever, 
the 
current Russian authorities are trying in every possible way to 
develop friendship with the "fraternal" West. Reliance on its 
assistance and defense is so great that these authorities did 
not and will not spare the price. But the price here is 
well-known--economic and every other kind of dependence on it 
for a "reviving Russia." While perfecting the priceless 
moral-political support of the "civilized world," vividly and 
opportunely demonstrated by it in the tragic days of 
September-October 1993, the Russian powers that be are trying to 
impede the objectively necessary transformation of the CIS into 
a real union of states in every way possible, for such a 
prospect is interpreted in the West as "the worst nightmare of 
all possible nightmares" in this world, with the exception of a 
nuclear war. 
  The proposals of Kazakhstan in the spirit of this prospect 
have long ago and openly been ignored by Moscow, and the 
decisive integrational initiative of Belarus was met with 
hostility by those influential figures who did everything to 
bury the idea of an "all-Union ruble space"; that is, to destroy 
one of the most important economic prerequisites for a political 
reintegration of the former Union republics. 
  In the light of the aforementioned understanding of the 
priorities of today's ruling elite, at the very least the 
endless reproaches directed at it on the part of our 
multicolored opposition look naive in that it, this elite, was 
formed out of loonies and professionally incompetent people. 
  The most urgent task of our reformers is to achieve the 
irreversibility of social processes in Russia and to bring it 
into the club of "democratic" states at any price. Only a 
bourgeois Russia can be brought into this club, but it is not 
entirely mandatory that it be independent and prosperous and, 
what is more, strong and possessing a powerful defense 
potential. With these kinds of parameters, Russia is not wanted 
in this club. And when "Russian opposition to its majesty" in 
the person of Skokov complains about the fact that "there has 
really not been any real reformation as such" and that, he said, 
as a result of the spontaneous process there has been some kind 
of restructuring of economic management "that still has not led 
to anything intelligible," then the impression is created that 
it will be difficult to free it, this opposition, from 
professional economic blindness. Does it really not see that the 
reforms, of which there did not seem to be any, changed the 
socioeconomic essence of Russian society and the state system of 
Russia in a radical way? There also were the kind that in their 
results were equivalent to a revolution or a counterrevolution. 
  And now the whole problem is only whether the social 
upheaval 
in Russia will turn out to be bourgeois-nationalistic or openly 
colonial-comprador in the final analysis. It appears that Yuriy 
Skokov and his like-thinkers in the Federation of Commodity 
Producers they head were hoping for the first variant. But then 
he, in private, should more carefully weigh the real reasons for 
his dismissal from key posts in the government. If this variant 
would be necessary to those circles that now determine the 
domestic and foreign policy of the country, then it cannot be 
ruled out that he specifically, Skokov, would be sitting now in 
the chair of the prime minister, devoting all of his official 
time to the restoration and development of commodity production 
and the creation of hothouse conditions for an industrial 
bourgeoisie, and not for a more quickly maturing trade-money 
lending bourgeoisie. But he is not sitting in this chair, 
inasmuch as the political elite of the country does not now 
stand in need of patrons from the commodity producers. 
  Generally speaking, the need for workers of such an 
orientation and such an economic mentality may not even surface 
in Russia in the foreseeable future. A majority of them are not 
capable of building a colonial-comprador model of the economy, a 
model which, as the most likely, shines through everything that 
is being done and is occurring in politics, in society, and in 
the economy of the country, and also in its relations with the 
near and far abroad. 
  A genuinely creative stage in the development of the economy 
of Russia can arrive only when the question of authority, that 
is, the most important political question of contemporary 
Russian life, is finally and reliably resolved either in favor 
of the national-patriotic strata of the rapidly forming 
bourgeoisie, which, out of necessity, will push aside from the 
state helm the pioneers of bourgeois restoration who are too 
closely tied to the West, or in favor of the supporters of a 
socialist orientation who are now capable in an incomparably 
greater measure than before to combine it with the priority of 
national-state interests. (In the latter case, it is a question 
actually of the Chinese variant of implementing the socialist 
choice on the path of development of a market economy.) 
  The appeals of the government and of the multifaceted 
opposition for reconciliation no matter what happens--and 
history indicates the nature of these appeals with the political 
amnesty in February of this year--undoubtedly make considerable 
social sense at the present time, when there is yet another 
regrouping of sociopolitical forces in the country. But the 
contradictions in society that were created by perestroyka and 
reforms are too deep for these appeals to play a substantial 
role in maintaining political stability in the country in the 
long term. Without significant adjustments in the positions of 
the government in the spirit of national-patriotic demands, or 
without a really meaningful personnel renewal of the authority 
structures in the very same spirit, social accord in Russia will 
be unthinkable. 
  Any programs, even the most effective ones for getting the 
country out of the crisis, will hang in the air, if they run 
counter to the interests of strengthening the positions of the 
present authorities, to its sociopolitical objectives, and to 
its already insurmountable engagement with the West. 
Consequently, in the near foreseeable term, the main line of 
struggle for the revival of a powerful and prosperous Russian 
state, as previously, will lie in the political and by no means 
in the economic sphere. And the endless claims of officials and 
of the mass media close to the authorities that the people are 
tired of politics are called on precisely to disorient Russians 
with respect to the location of this main line.

<F P=106> [Report and commentary by KOMMERSANT-DAILY political </F>
department: "Nonpayments Crisis; National Security Still Secure"] 
  [Text] The hearings that were held yesterday in the 
Federation Council on the subject of the "Nonpayments Crisis in 
the Country's Economy," organized by the budget committee of the 
Federation Council with the participation of the Economic Reform 
Committee and representatives of the government, were the 
authorities' first official reaction to the president's 
statement that the "nonpayments crisis is assuming a political 
character and becoming a threat to the country's national 
security." Nevertheless, the general tone of a majority of the 
speeches was not equal to the dramatic nature of the president's 
message. 
  Opening the hearings, Nikolay Gonchar, chairman of the 
budget 
committee, noted that despite repeated attempts to resolve the 
nonpayments problem, the situation remains critical. It is 
already a question of an insolvency crisis as a whole. 
  On 1 January 1994, overdue accounts payable amounted to 
more than 16 trillion rubles [R] (7.1 percent of GDP). Overdue 
accounts receivable reached R18 trillion. State indebtedness for 
military deliveries totaled R876.4 billion, and for grain 
purchases--R620 billion. 
  Andrey Kazmin, deputy minister of finance, noted that the 
nonpayments situation (although, according to his words, their 
absolute magnitude has decreased in comparison with January of 
last year) was negatively affected by nonfulfillment of the 
budget for 1993. Nevertheless, he expressed the firm conviction 
that in the first quarter the Ministry of Finance will gradually 
pay off indebtedness to the branches for the past year, thanks 
to centralized credit granted by the Central Bank to cover the 
budget deficit. Among other measures in the struggle with 
nonpayments he mentioned the extension of credit to the end user 
within the framework of one branch and "intensifying control 
over pumping money into hard currency and deposit accounts." 
  In contrast to the speech by Kazmin (whom more restrained 
members of parliament called "a little boy"), the speech of 
Mariya Paramonova, deputy chairman of the Central Bank of 
Russia, was greeted more favorably. After noting that the 
problem of nonpayments is a problem essentially of state 
enterprises (the net surpluses in the accounts of commercial 
enterprises total R22 trillion), Madame Paramonova declared that 
the task of the financial organs is to stimulate the use of free 
resources. In her opinion, the problem of nonpayments has a 
structural character, and it is impossible to resolve it only by 
an interbranch offset. The recommendations of the Central Bank 
looked somewhat old fashioned to a majority of the deputies: 
strengthen financial control over the activity of enterprises, 
enter a line in balance sheets "sold for cash," clarify which 
kind of enterprises are profitable and which are not, lower the 
tax rate on profits to 20 percent for enterprises that are 
experiencing a shortage of circulating funds, with an assignment 
of part of the income from this tax for their replenishment, 
reorganize RKTs [cash account centers] into clearing centers, 
and also restore the priority schedule of payments. All of this, 
it is true, will require changing at minimum 20 legislative acts. 
  Sergey Ignatyev, deputy minister of the economy, had his own 
approach to the problem. After self-critically admitting that 
the government's debts constitute 50 percent of the volume of 
nonpayments, he declared: As long as the government takes 
unfulfilled obligations upon itself, inflation and nonpayments 
will continue. To fight nonpayments, Ignatyev proposed the 
following scheme: An additional account is opened for each 
enterprise where it has a settlement account to which resources 
of the centralized credit of the Central Bank are deposited to 
pay off indebtedness. After the conduct of settlements, surplus 
resources are transferred to the main account. Only in this 
case, in the opinion of the Ministry of Economics, will the long 
process of paying off indebtedness not cause long-term 
inflationary consequences. 
  Yesterday's hearing, in fact, was limited to a demonstration 
of the various approaches of various structures of the executive 
authority to the problem of nonpayments. It is apparent that 
neither the executive nor the legislative authority are yet 
ready to resolve the problem of nonpayments in a radical 
way--through bankruptcy of insolvent enterprises. They are 
continuing to search for "milder" ways. The hearings will 
continue next week, and it can be expected that the positions of 
their participants will become more radical over time. 
<H5>  Commentary </H5>
  The first stage of the hearings "Crisis of Nonpayments in 
the 
Country's Economy," which took place in the Federation Council 
at the initiative of its participants, graphically demonstrated 
not only a lack in the government of any kind of integral 
concept for solving the nonpayments situation that has 
developed, but also the fact that it does not intend to allow 
legislators to get near a resolution of this question. As early 
as in the morning, learning of this measure in the Federation 
Council, First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets announced at 
his news conference that nonpayments are a matter for the 
government and not the parliament. Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin (who, like Soskovets, also received an invitation 
to these hearings) also did not consider it necessary to attend 
them. Attendees at the hearings came to the conclusion on this 
basis that the executive authority simply had nothing to say. 
  Meanwhile, it can be stated that the first stage of the 
hearings aroused great interest among high-ranking 
representatives of the industrial managerial elite. Present in 
the chamber were Minister of Fuel and Energy Yuriy Shafranik, 
the heads of administration of many Russian regions, deputies of 
both chambers, and plant directors--in other words, all those 
who felt that they were suffering most from nonpayments in the 
current situation. Taking this into account, the conclusion can 
be drawn that the initiator of the holding of the hearings--the 
budget and finance committee headed by Nikolay Gonchar--in fact 
brought additional political attention to the upper chamber of 
the Federal Assembly by demonstrating that he is capable of 
asking sharp questions independently, without asking for the 
preliminary approval of the executive branch. Grounds for 
assuming the opposite were provided as far back as the election 
of the speaker of the Federation Council, when the executive 
branch succeeded in ensuring the victory of Vladimir Shumeyko. 
The Federation Council also undoubtedly acquired some moral 
capital, by showing that it is far more concerned about the 
situation that has developed in the economy of the country than 
the government. 
  However, Nikolay Gonchar did not begin to place the 
committee 
in opposition to the government. Having reproached the Council 
of Ministers for not yet developing a concept for combating 
nonpayments, Nikolay Gonchar declared that this problem will be 
resolved successfully only in the event that the efforts of the 
"profile" departments, the legislative, and the executive 
authorities are united. It is obvious that this is also a bow in 
the direction of regional leaders who still see in government 
authority the only method of solving their material problems. 
The capabilities and opportunities of the Federation Council, 
judging by everything, remain unclear for them.

<F P=106> [Article by Gleb Cherkasov: "Number of Privatized </F>
Enterprises Increasing--Center for Privatization Wants To Help 
With Knowledge and Money"] 
  [Text] Maksim Boyko, general director of the Russian Center 
for Privatization, held a briefing at which he shared his 
impressions regarding the course of privatization in Russia, 
provided an assessment of results already achieved, and related 
plans for the near future of the center he heads. 
  In Mr. Boyko's opinion, the privatization of large and 
medium-scale state enterprises is proceeding with ever 
increasing success. As of today, 10,000 enterprises, at which 11 
million workers are employed, have been privatized to the extent 
of 70-80 percent. If the present rate is maintained--and right 
now about 900 enterprises are being privatized monthly--by the 
middle of 1994 they will number 13,000-14,000. In Mr. Boyko's 
words, the number of shareholders in Russia comes to 40 percent 
of the populace--much greater than in the United States or 
England--and development of the securities market is exceeding 
all expectations. 
  The holders of enterprise stock can be divided into three 
groups, the general director stated. The first group, the 
largest, comprises labor collectives themselves, which hold more 
than 50 percent of the shares, as a rule. The second largest 
group with respect to number of acquired shares consists of 
major commercial structures which purchase shares of enterprises 
at auctions. Finally we have the third group, consisting of 
ordinary citizens. 
  In discussing the present state of privatized enterprises, 
Maksim Boyko cited data from a sociological survey conducted by 
the fund jointly with the World Bank. We see that 60 percent of 
enterprises have started changing the selection and composition 
of their production output, have replaced their suppliers of raw 
materials, and have set about reducing the number of persons 
employed in production. In Mr. Boyko's opinion, enterprises 
converted to joint-stock operation and partially privatized 
enterprises have been released from the guardianship of sector 
ministries, and now independently determine their future plans. 
It is likely that in the near future, some privatized 
enterprises will begin issuing new securities. They require 
financial and consultative assistance, however. The Russian 
Center for Privatization intends to assist them in this. 
  In the words of Maksim Boyko, the center is developing 
programs that should provide enterprises all the information 
they need to exist under free market conditions and help find 
foreign partners and investors. Last year the "Big Seven" 
allocated $3 billion to establish the Fund To Assist 
Privatization. It is expected that a portion of these funds will 
go toward "technical assistance" programs. In addition, three 
regional funds are being established: the Mid-Russia, 
South-Russia, and St. Petersburg funds. According to Mr. Boyko, 
it is planned to create similar funds in other regions. 
  Concerning the activity of check investment funds, Maksim 
Boyko surmised that the most solid funds would now start a 
search for their own character, reducing the selection of 
securities they have and gradually shifting over to narrow 
specialization.

<F P=106> [Article by O. Osipenko, general director of Rinkon </F>
consulting company and president of Audeks auditing firm, and M. 
Margolin, director of the EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN Economic and Legal 
Consultation and Business Information Agency's legal center: 
"State Privatization Program: Internal Contradictions"] 
  [Text] The State Program of Privatization of State and 
Municipal Enterprises went into effect beginning 1 January. One 
has to admit with regret, however, that the long-awaited and 
finally adopted state program has inherited two main 
shortcomings from its 1992 predecessor. Namely, failure to 
describe the main mechanisms for implementation of a score of 
requirements defined in a most general form, and obvious and 
hidden contradictions. 
  Without claiming an exhaustive analysis of the document, we 
would like to offer some comments on individual provisions of 
the state privatization program. 
<H5>  I. Buyout of Land Lots </H5>
  The most impressive example of imperfections of the former 
kind is the remaining uncertainty in the matter of buyout of 
land lots by privatized enterprises. Can one use privatization 
vouchers for buyouts? If so, to what extent (along with rubles)? 
In what form should one apply and what is the time frame for 
review? Which precise property fund (oblast, rayon) is the 
seller? (The state program mentions "corresponding property 
funds.") What are the procedures for interaction between rayon 
and city land use committees and property funds in the buyout 
process? Does an enterprise acquired in the process of 
privatization as a single property complex won in a bid or at 
auction have the right to buy out the land lot? (It is easy to 
see that the existing norm in the current law, duplicated by 
Article 5.3.7. of the state program--regarding the requirement 
that more than 80 percent of shares of privatized enterprise 
must be first sold for vouchers--covers only facilities 
converted to joint-stock holding.) The answers to these and many 
similar questions remain up in the air. As do the proclamations 
of the official ideologists of privatization of enhancing its 
attractiveness through state emission of "land privatization 
vouchers." 
<H5>  II. Reorganization of Enterprises Undergoing Privatization </H5>
  Neither are many practical problems of privatization removed 
by another provision literally borrowed from current economic 
legislation--that structural subunits are not permitted to be 
separated from privatized enterprises (with the potential 
autonomous privatization of these subunits) if they constitute 
"a single technological complex." Skipping the interpretation of 
the latter notion, the program provides poor aid to the work of 
commissions on arbitration of disputes between state enterprises 
and their subunits, which currently act under the guidance of 
the joint directive of the Russian Federation GKI [State 
Committee for the Administration of State Property] and Russian 
Federation GKAP [State Committee for Antimonopoly Policy and 
Support of New Economic Structures] No. LB 4953 and No. 1898-r, 
dated 3 November 1993. 
<H5>  III. Sale of Equity (Interest, Shares) Owned by the State </H5>
  Despite outward operational simplicity, the problem of 
privatizing state equity in partnerships and joint-stock 
companies of mixed form of ownership is still shrouded in 
mystery. Article 5.2 of the program says that the corresponding 
state equity (blocks of stock) must be sold through auctions and 
bids. Meanwhile, the procedures for holding them remain unclear, 
as also the forms and time frame within which the winners in 
these actions and bids must pay for this interest, information 
support for this procedure, who may initiate privatization of 
state-owned equity in joint ventures, limited liability 
partnerships, joint-stock companies, and so on. It is indicative 
that this is the only privatization method of those included in 
the general list that has not received any comments in the text 
of Part 5 of the state program. 
<H3>  IV. Status of Property Contributions By State Enterprises In 
the Charter Capital of Other Enterprises </H3>
  Comparison of the previous (1992) and current texts of the 
privatization program show that its authors no longer insist 
that state enterprises' contributions to the charter capital 
(funds) of enterprises of any organizational-legal form be 
considered state property and property funds--their legal 
successors (Paragraphs 4 and 6 of Article 5.1 of the 1992 state 
program). It is clear that this provision obviously contradicted 
Article 14 of the RSFSR Law "On Property in the RSFSR," the 
methodology of appraising state enterprises' property in 
determining the size of charter capital (Decree No. 66 of the 
Russian Federation President dated 29 January 1992) and standard 
privatization plan. However, the problems that have emerged as a 
result of applying this provision of the old state program last 
year, for instance, are thereby not resolved at all. The 
corresponding interest in "business type" enterprises, which at 
the insistence of some committees and property funds was not 
included in appraisals, quite often is still carried on 
joint-stock companies' books. The conundrum of this situation is 
that now the legal base for transferring the rights to these 
contributions (blocks of shares) to property funds is absent. 
The property has in a way ended up in neverland: On one hand, it 
is not recognized as the property of the AOOT's [publicly held 
joint-stock company], which are the legal successors of state 
enterprises; on the other, it has not been really transferred to 
the funds, which in addition have lost the prospects for a 
legally documented transfer of the corresponding rights. 
  From the examples above one may draw the following 
conclusions. Either the state program's authors assumed in 
advance that this document cannot, and should not, be a 
direct-action normative act; or they deliberately gave carte 
blanche to regional committees and property funds to engage in 
various sorts of improvisations. 
  It should be noted that the former hypothesis is only 
partially supported. Thereby giving legitimacy to the latter. 
Really, the state program assumes, for instance, that giving 
officials of bodies of state administration the role of 
representing the interests of the state in joint-stock 
companies' boards of directors, the procedures for maintaining 
the stockholder register, and the procedure for preparation and 
conduct of a general shareholder meeting of a publicly held 
joint-stock company are to be spelled out in special statutes 
drafted and approved by the Russian State Committee for the 
Administration of State Property or with its direct 
participation. One would think that if we just have patience and 
wait for the issuance of these administrative acts, complete 
harmony will come to reign in matters of the mechanism of 
implementing the corresponding requirements of the state 
program. Alas, this is only a first glance and incorrect 
impression. No matter how perfect from the standpoint of 
corresponding procedures these documents may end up being, their 
authors clearly will attempt to keep them from contradicting the 
main text of the state program. Thus frequently driving future 
executors up a normative dead end of sorts. 
<H3>  V. Joint-Stock Company Administrative Bodies. Stockholders 
General Meeting </H3>
  Let us pay attention, for instance, to the fact that the 
first of the aforementioned statutes, whose development is 
envisaged by Point 3 of Article 2.3 of the state program, will 
include the institution of representing the holder of the 
controlling share of stock in a joint-stock company--the 
state--for some reason only on the board of directors. At the 
same time, the procedures for their participation in general 
meetings of stockholders apparently remained undefined. The same 
is confirmed, by the way, by another provision of the same point 
of the state program, which says that officials of bodies of 
state administration will represent the interests of the state 
in the boards of directors on a contract basis. Does it follow 
from this that the right to vote for the corresponding share of 
stock may be given to other functionaries of corresponding 
departments? Can the state be represented at general 
stockholders meetings, in the event the controlling share of 
stock is "frozen" in state ownership up to three years, by, for 
instance, representatives of holding companies or FPGs 
[financial-industrial group] operating in the same sectors as 
the joint-stock company? Answers to these and similar questions 
apparently take us into the sphere of rather creative 
interpretations of the program. In any case, the second 
provision of Article 11.4 ("Representatives of the 
administration and employees of joint-stock companies cannot act 
as representatives of the state at shareholders meetings and on 
the board of directors") appears to mean, after all, 
representatives of this particular joint-stock company. 
  The latter assumption, however, is based only on a common 
sense judgment. Unfortunately, the program authors, while 
including in it some mandatory provisions, clearly forgot about 
this. This involves, in particular, such requirements enumerated 
in Point 9 as mandatory mailing to participants in the general 
shareholder meeting materials on the meeting agenda, including 
ballots for voting in elections of the audit commission. 
  The point is that by its legal and commercial nature, most 
plans for shareholder meetings are of a confidential nature 
(first and foremost with respect to setting up new enterprises 
on a shared basis with other partners; board of directors and 
audit commission's reports, which enumerate joint-stock company 
clients; some especially sensitive intra-company provisions; 
etc.). Thus, in attempting to "protect shareholders' rights" in 
the form of the utmost openness, according to the logic of the 
state program the joint-stock company's executive bodies must 
deliberately put themselves in conflict with investors and 
partners in cooperation. 
  As to the requirement of mailing electoral ballots for the 
audit commission's election (assuming, of course, that they will 
not be blank forms, which would be absurd), this is technically 
impossible altogether. As is known, current legislation does not 
contain any restrictions regarding stockholders' rights to be 
nominated for membership in this control body of the joint-stock 
company. For instance, current legislation does not have the 
requirement that the written consent of the nominee must be 
obtained and the nomination procedure completed one week before 
the meeting (unlike, for instance, nominations to the board of 
directors). Which means that stockholders may nominate their 
representatives to the audit commission right at the meeting. 
What is the point then in mailing the ballots home? 
  Another item that clearly contradicts common sense and 
current legislation is the restriction contained in Point 9.10.6 
of the state program with respect to converting publicly held 
joint-stock companies into privately held joint-stock companies 
and limited liability partnerships (and all publicly held 
companies at that, not only successors to state-owned 
enterprises); and the quotas on membership of outside investors 
in their boards of directors. The point is not that these bans 
are easy to circumvent (which is precisely what happens in 
practice). The issue is whether we should expect much of the 
provisions in the state program given that they have absorbed 
the norms launched into legislative orbit in total disregard of 
the entire sum of other current legislative acts, as well as 
stockholders' true--not perceived--interests. 
  The answer to the latter question suggests that as in 
1992-1993, committees for the administration of property, 
property funds, working privatization commissions, as well as 
executive bodies of joint-stock companies will have to resort to 
quite major improvisations in using the norms of the document 
under review. 
  Essentially, one is led to this conclusion also by direct 
contradictions within the state program, of an internal nature, 
and the different interpretations that are inevitable in 
comparing it with other normative acts. 
  An example. According to Article 17.5 of the state program, 
activities of unregistered financial-industrial groups are not 
permitted. Meanwhile, this does not follow from the main 
document regulating the process of creation of FPGs--Edict No. 
2096 of the Russian Federation President of 5 December 1993. The 
functioning of full-fledged FPGs, a long as they do not claim 
the right to use in their company name the words 
"financial-industrial group," and the corresponding state 
preferences for those that have been approved by the State 
Committee on Industry, is not forbidden at all.

<F P=106> [Article by Igor Petrov: "Local Authorities: Many Rights But </F>
No Money"] 
  [Text] The principle of federalism in forming Russia's 
state budget is based on one firm postulate: Having received 
substantial financial independence, local authorities assume 
increased responsibility for the state of affairs in their 
region. It would seem that this is a completely sensible and 
well considered approach: New rights entail new obligations. 
Indeed, when matters take such a turn, the center begins to have 
fewer headaches regarding what, how and in what amounts to 
finance this or that in Taldom or Kostroma. 
  But in practice, as often happens, a good idea for some 
reason unfailingly takes a negative turn. The authorities in 
small cities and settlements, instead of an easing of the 
federal tax burden, which permitted them to hope for resolution 
of many local issues, acquired a whole pile of new problems 
without any financial levers whatsoever. Figuratively speaking, 
it was proposed to the local authorities that they swim a 
hundred meters but it had been forgotten to untie their hands 
first. 
  Such are the basic themes in the open letter sent to the 
leadership of the country by the chairman of the Association of 
Heads of City and Regional Administrations of the Moscow Oblast 
Roman Popkovich. It is reported in the letter, in particular, 
that the change in the norm for payments to local budgets from 
various kinds of taxes, designated by the President's December 
edicts, is leading to a situation where even such a rich oblast 
as the Moscow Oblast, which gives the federal treasury almost 
half of its income, cannot now get along without substantial 
subsidies. 
  Moscow Oblast's budget deficit under the new normative 
payments, according to R. Popkovich, will increase in 1994 by at 
least one trillion rubles. This will make it impossible to 
finance departmental residential housing and social 
cultural-facilities that have been transferred since January of 
this year to municipal ownership. 
  Only retention of differentiated norms for payments from 
federal taxes into the budgets of the regions, in the opinion of 
the members of the association, can provide a way out of the 
situation that has been created. For the Moscow oblast, these 
payments should be no less than 75 percent with respect to the 
value added tax (VAT) and a full 100 percent with respect to the 
individual income tax. 
  A letter from representatives of the executive authorities 
of 
the Moscow region, which is filled with disconcerting forecasts, 
was written immediately after the draft of the federal budget, 
prepared by the Ministry of Finance, had become public. 
According to the letter, almost 13.4 percent of gross domestic 
product (GDP) is allocated for support of the territories. This 
is a gigantic sum, if one takes into account that the slogan of 
the federalization of the budget, as has already been stated 
many times, was supposed to become the fundamental watchword of 
the government in 1994. In other words, the local authorities 
are to rely on their own financial resources. But for many 
regions, these resources, as is rapidly becoming clear, are 
catastrophically insufficient. 
  Thus, according to data for January to November 1993, the 
federal budget transferred 2.4 trillion rubles to territorial 
budgets on the basis of mutual settlements, 967 billion rubles 
in the form of subventions, and--to certain regions for 
resolving "burning" issues--103 billion rubles in the form of 
short-term loans. In the fourth quarter, the volume of funds 
allocated from the center sharply increased, totalling 2.6 
billion rubles [as published], or 11.7 percent, of the total 
expenditures of the Russian budget. 
  But how can the level of social security for the population 
of the country be effectively equalized if certain subjects of 
the federation (Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, Chechnya) have 
directed practically all taxes they have collected into the 
budgets of their own territories. Last year, for example, 100 
percent of the profits tax, 99 percent of the VAT, and 94 
percent of excise taxes were transferred to the budget of the 
Republic of Sakha (Yakutiya). In the Republic of Karelia, the 
corresponding transfers to the budget of the territory were 96 
percent, 92 percent, and 91 percent. And, nevertheless, this was 
not enough money. 
  As you know, over 51 percent of the total expenditures from 
the consolidated budget goes to expenditures from the federal 
budget. Twenty-eight percent of all revenue was allocated from 
the resources of the federal budget just for the support of the 
national economy in 1993. This money is used to help the coal 
industry, the agro-industrial complex, the defense complex, and 
many other entities. 
  Will the local authorities be able to cope with the economic 
and social problems of their own territories? They should be 
able to. In any case, they say they can. But in order to do so, 
as a minimum, they require more financial and taxation 
independence. The federal government, it seems, should provide 
them such an opportunity. Local leaders will then not have 
reason to make declarations about the "tax robberies" of the 
center. Then, perhaps, we will forever rid ourselves of the 
currently appealing watchword of oblast and regional 
"independence."

<F P=106> [Interview with Mikhail Zadornov, chairman of the Russian </F>
Federation State Duma Committee for the Budget, Taxes, Banks, 
and Finances, by political observer Vil Dorofeyev; place, date 
not given: "Must We Live Without a Budget Until the Summer?" -- 
first paragraph is introduction] 
  [Text] Mikhail Zadornov, chairman of the Russian 
Federation State Duma Committee for the Budget, Taxes, Banks, 
and Finances, answers questions from political observer Vil 
Dorofeyev. 
  [Dorofeyev] We are coming to the end of the first quarter of 
1994. But as far as I know, a draft budget has not even been 
examined at sessions of your State Duma committee. 
  [Zadornov] The country is "crawling" into the second quarter 
without an approved budget. Six weeks have been set aside for 
the review procedure in the Federal Assembly's lower chamber, 
but you should add another two weeks to enable the Federation 
Council and the president to carry out the same work. Which 
means that, even in the most favorable conditions, a draft 
budget cannot be approved before the end of May. But this is 
the most optimistic scenario. As you know from press reports, 
the draft budget is the object of much fierce fighting within 
the Russian Government. The story of 1992-1993 is being 
repeated, when a delay in submitting this extremely important 
document for the country to parliament meant that it had to be 
examined in double-quick time, which subsequently resulted in 
major amendments to and disruption of all the work that was 
required both to prepare and to implement the draft budget. 
  [Dorofeyev] This seems to be yet another negative tradition 
in post-Soviet Russia. What is its primary cause? 
  [Zadornov] Ignorance on the part of the executive of the law 
on the budget structure and the budget process in the Russian 
Federation. Some may retort that last year's budget and this 
year's were submitted to parliament behind schedule owing to 
objective factors of our internal political life. But there is 
nothing more pernicious than ignorance of the law in the name of 
day-to-day expediency. Unfortunately, precedents such as these 
become implanted in the mentality of state figures and are 
transformed into negative habits. 
  [Dorofeyev] In other countries the budget is the basis of 
everything. What about our country? 
  [Zadornov] The budget should also play the same role in 
Russia. Since there are no more state plans, there is only an 
economic forecast for the current year prepared by the 
government. The budget is therefore a fundamental document which 
determines the country's economic policy. In my view, the lack 
of a draft budget at the proper time is in many ways indicative 
of the fact that the present government also lacks a considered 
and consistent policy. 
  [Dorofeyev] Let us assume that you are not familiar with the 
main points of the future budget. But in your view, what should 
the fundamental principle of this document be? 
  [Zadornov] First of all I would like to get an answer to a 
question that is fundamental in my view: What is the 
government's current policy? I would like the draft budget to 
shed light on the overall approach to economic policy and I 
would certainly like it to envision groundwork for the future. 
For example, priorities in the structural restructuring of 
industry and priority social programs. In order to make it 
clear which sectors or groups of enterprises are known to be 
unprofitable and likely to go bankrupt. As a result of this, we 
can realistically anticipate how much unemployment to expect and 
how much money the government will need to spend in order to 
alleviate the negative consequences of these processes. 
  Second, I would like the present budget to be realistic. 
Just look at the budget transformations we witnessed in 1992 
and 1993. Initially a very tough budget was approved. At the 
same time it was stated that inflation would be between 3 and 5 
percent by the end of the year. But already by the following 
month, and two months later at the most, the government itself 
started to ignore the budget it had approved. And then we had a 
chain reaction on our hands. 
  What disturbs me most in the draft of the present budget? 
The promise that yet again we will witness 3-5 percent 
inflation by the end of the year. I would prefer to see a 
slightly larger budget deficit in the draft, provided there are 
specific indications that it is required to implement social 
programs. 
  [Dorofeyev] Does it not seem to you that the budget deficit 
is a bit of a bugbear? America lives with a budget deficit. 
  [Zadornov] Not just the United States. Last year the 
British budget deficit amounted to almost 9 percent of GDP. The 
Italian and French deficits are at least 5 percent of GDP. 
Although countries which have expressed a desire to join the 
European Currency Union have been presented with the condition 
that they must limit the size of their current budget deficit. 
With the exception of two or three states, no country in West 
Europe can be said to belong in this category. Because a budget 
deficit is a big problem for any state and it cannot be resolved 
in a year. 
  [Dorofeyev] On 3 March we were shown a government session on 
television. A number of fat volumes were lying on the premier's 
table. The newsreader announced that the draft budget had 
basically been approved by the government. And then the press 
flashed reports that the Ministry of Defense, the agrarian 
lobby, and many others were unhappy with the agreed budget. 
  [Zadornov] You know, in any country the budget is a document 
that cannot please everyone. Because there will always be 
differences of opinion between the budget planners and the 
demands, submissions, and proposals of ministries, departments, 
and social groups. The latter group always asks for more 
whereas the former allocates less. But the fact that the draft 
budget had basically been approved by the government 3 March 
demonstrates something quite different: Nobody in the 
government was able to suggest any serious, comprehensive 
alternatives to the agreed version of the budget. Even though 
the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Defense, in 
particular the State Committee for the Defense Sectors of 
Industry, have major differences of opinion about this draft of 
the budget. 
  But I am interested in the position of the government 
chairman as the conductor of economic policy as a whole. The 
financial element is undoubtedly important, and the size of the 
planned budget deficit and the inflation rate are equally 
important indicators which act as guidelines. But they should 
be factored into the very economic policy which provides answers 
to the questions: What will the country live on for the 
specific year in question? On export sectors? Which ones 
exactly? How will income be distributed? How big will the Army 
be and how will Army cutbacks be implemented? How will we begin 
to implement the mine closure program, for example, which the 
government has planned to carry out before the year 2000? 
  You must understand that I am using a few examples to 
demonstrate that this document should contain answers to issues 
relating to the development of the economy as a whole and the 
development of its most important sectors, while at the same 
time it should enshrine mechanisms for redistributing financial 
and labor resources. In other words, the budget should not be 
approached from rigid positions. 
  [Dorofeyev] If you had to work on the draft, what guiding 
principles would you use to agree on an acceptable budget for 
the country? 
  [Zadornov] In the current year, unfortunately, there is 
little that can be changed. But if I were to take part in 
preparing next year's budget, I would put the accent on cutting 
expenditures, which is an important objective in itself, and on 
relieving tax pressure. It is already clear that we have 
already completely exhausted the policy which has been pursued 
over the past two years, that of increasing the tax scale and 
beefing up the ruthless penalties for late payment of taxes. We 
must therefore avoid any abrupt changes in course and switch 
gradually and carefully to a policy of reducing the tax burden. 
I would reduce the tax on profit, for example, if profits were 
to be used for investment purposes. 
  A second aspect of this problem is the fact that some 
enterprises, particularly those engaged in foreign economic 
activity, have avoided paying taxes. It is unlikely that 
administrative or fiscal measures will achieve anything in this 
instance. We apparently require some sort of social contract 
between the State Taxation Service, the Ministry of Finance, and 
the tax police -- basically, between government as a whole and 
business. I think that directors of major enterprises and 
businessmen have a very good idea about the tax threshold which 
would be acceptable to them in the present circumstances. If we 
agree to this threshold, or even to a figure slightly above it, 
then I believe that by cutting taxes we would gain rather than 
lose because the total volume of revenue would increase. 
  Finally, the problem of the regions. Some of them have 
special tax arrangements whereby they do not consider it 
incumbent upon them to pay federal taxes. The whole tax-break 
system is far from sound. Tax breaks as a whole represent 
colossal sums. Someone has to make the political decision to 
make all components of the Federation equal in terms of budget 
and taxation arrangements. All should pay taxes into the 
federal budget and pay them on equal terms. 
  [Dorofeyev] Let us come back to the "94 budget." This 
budget stipulates, for example, that only 0.3 percent of GDP has 
been earmarked for cultural needs, and a slightly larger sum is 
to be spent on science. Is this right? 
  [Zadornov] No. But this is a problem of priorities. I 
believe that culture, science, and education form one of these 
priorities. This is the foundation of the country's future. 
Our "Yabloko" [Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin] bloc would also add 
children's health care to the list. Here too, we believe, these 
priorities should not be dependent on overall shortfalls in 
revenue; they should be protected by specific statute. 
  [Dorofeyev] But who will determine the priority approach and 
how? 
  [Zadornov] This is a question of state policy. It is the 
state's business to formulate clear and lucid criteria and a 
procedure which enables these criteria to be discussed in 
society and the appropriate state organs. Incidentally, in 
discussing the draft budget our committee intends to listen to 
and take account of the opinion of all committees and 
commissions. We do not have much time, but we will hold fairly 
wide-ranging parliamentary hearings into this problem.

<F P=106> [Article by Rustam Narzikulov: "The Federation's Trojan </F>
Horse"] 
  [Text] The statement of the chairman of the Council of the 
Federation about the need to introduce emergency measures in the 
economy has been highly surprising considering the comparatively 
favorable results of the work of the renewed Chernomyrdin 
government in January-February of this year. 
  The average rates of monthly inflation came to 17 percent 
during this period while in February they fell below 10 percent 
for the first time since the liberalization of the economy. 
  Most likely Shumeyko was shaken by data concerning the drop 
in industrial production in February 1994 by 24.1 percent in 
comparison with the analogous period of last year, as a result 
of which the proposal to quickly change something in the 
management of the economy has been born. But if the speaker of 
the Council of the Federation would have had a bit of time free 
from important state meetings then he would have, first, paid 
attention to the regular January "collapses" in industrial 
production constantly repeating in recent years. 
  Without regard to the causes of the fatal dislike of 
industry 
for the first month of the year (and they, of course, are not in 
the large number of New Year celebrations, since the 
average-daily January indicators also demonstrate the same 
tendency to fall) precisely January exerts a decisive influence 
on the entire annual dynamics of the gross indicators. All the 
remaining months are characterized by an absence of jumps in 
production and, based on the year's results, the gross economic 
indicators produce a picture differing insignificantly from that 
of January. 
  So that Mr. Shumeyko needed to propose emergency measures in 
the economy a month earlier. Now his initiative looks 
economically somewhat strange, especially based on the fact that 
in February the volume of industrial production... grew by 2.3 
percent in comparison with January. Well, if one is to be quite 
precise, then proposals about introducing emergency measures in 
the economy were more appropriate after the January drop of a 
year ago. Then there also was another speaker, and the deputies 
acted differently towards the possibility of abrupt movements in 
the economy. Legislative support of emergency measures in the 
economy would have been unquestioning. 
  How poorly does the speaker of the Council of the Federation 
reflect economic reality, so well does he relay the lobbyist 
moods of the masses--there cannot be another reason for 
discussions about emergency measures in the economy. To the 
typical deputy-dilettante, cries about the growth of 
non-payments and the drop in production seem to be the most 
favorable occasion for demonstrating concern about the domestic 
economy. 
  It is unimportant that non-payments are the ordinary 
situation of the lack of effective demand (and there exist 
rather simple and well known methods for clearing up the 
finances of bankrupt enterprises) and that the size of the drop, 
not even touching upon the inadequacies of this aggregated 
indicator, demonstrates the absolute need for structural changes 
in the economy (this refers primarily to the military-industrial 
complex), et cetera, et cetera. For the deputy-dilettante, the 
chief thing is to declare threateningly about his feelings about 
approaching catastrophe and to "offer proposals." 
  Since the deputy-dilettante knows no other "proposals" 
except 
emergency measures in the economy, the formidable weapon in his 
opinion--the words "emergency," "urgent," and "freeze"--is 
extracted from his vocabulary. 
  The lack of the habit of analysis does not permit such a 
deputy to understand that, in initiating the introduction of 
emergency measures in the economy, he not only condemns the 
country to economic chaos but also digs his own political grave. 
You see, the executive power (a government, president or simply 
a dictator), having received the okay for emergency measures has 
no more need for legislators and legislative supervision. It is 
not to be ruled out that Mr. Shumeyko also will be able to carry 
out in such a situation the third in his life 
parliamentary-governmental game of musical chairs. But it is 
hardly worth doubting that from the moment emergency measures in 
the economy are introduced the remaining deputies will have to 
seek new work.

<F P=106> [Interview with A. Vavilov, first deputy minister of finance </F>
of the Russian Federation, by V. Andreyev; place and date not 
given: "High Taxes or High Responsibility?"] 
  [Text] The problem of nonpayments can be called one 
of the main ills of the Russian economy which also affects the 
fiscal interests of the state--many enterprises simply stop 
paying taxes, the absence of funds in their settlement accounts 
being given as the explanation. At the same time, the potential 
of regulatory state organs with regard to the nonpayers is quite 
limited. Our interlocutor, A. Vavilov, the first deputy minister 
of finance of the Russian Federation, discussed measures that 
the state intends to take in order to restore order in this 
area. 
  [Andreyev] Andrey Petrovich, how could a situation emerge in 
which even the tax inspector is not in a position to collect the 
amount of taxes due from an enterprise? 
  [Vavilov] The essence of the nonpayment problem is in the 
fact that enterprises are no longer held accountable for the 
nonpayment of anything. In conjunction with a lack of funds, 
they do not pay taxes to the budget, do not pay their suppliers 
for goods and services, and so on. At the same time, some 
enterprises have, in addition to the settlement account, 
foreign-exchange, deposit, and other accounts to which the tax 
inspectorate has no access. 
  Besides, even the most inveterate nonpayers as a rule own 
certain property that is not directly related to production 
operations--passenger cars, and so on. Even in a case where the 
bank has on file the demand of the tax inspectorate to debit 
funds without acceptance, an enterprise will manage to acquire 
such property or make other payments (for example, pay bonuses 
to its employees) bypassing the settlement account. Under the 
current procedure, the tax inspector who represents state power 
is powerless. 
  [Andreyev] However, if someone is not in a position to pay 
his debts in a normal economy, he may simply be declared 
bankrupt. Even here a creditor is entitled to bring a relevant 
lawsuit in the court. Can the tax service be empowered to at 
least act as a regular creditor does, and can a debt to the 
state be considered possible grounds for making a claim for all 
property of the enterprise? 
  [Vavilov] This is precisely the essence of measures proposed 
by the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Russia in 
order to create an effective system for the collection of taxes. 
First of all, the tax service will be granted the right to levy 
execution upon any accounts of a given legal entity or 
individual in the event that taxes are not transferred to the 
budget in a timely manner. The tax inspectorate will also be 
granted the right to confiscate toward the unpaid taxes a 
proportion of the property of enterprises which is not directly 
related to the main line of production. Finally, in the extreme 
case that these funds for the settlement with the budget are 
lacking, reorganization measures or bankruptcy procedures may be 
used against the enterprise. 
  Of course, the latter scenario is quite painful and 
undesirable, but it will be used unequivocally against 
enterprises whose debt to the state and whose financial 
situation leave no hope for the normalization of the situation. 
  We also plan to introduce certain punitive sanctions to be 
used against companies implicated in the violations of 
disbursement discipline and procedures for settlements in cash. 
Certain restrictions also existed in this area before, but 
violators were virtually not liable in any way. 
  [Andreyev] Are there plans to introduce any new taxes or 
change their rates, in addition to what was envisioned by the 
December decrees of the president? 
  [Vavilov] At present, we are not planning to make any major 
changes in the tax system itself. As of now, the most urgent 
task is to create an optimal mechanism for the collection of 
taxes. 
  [Andreyev] In what manner will the government solve the 
problem of mutual nonpayments by enterprises as far as the 
prevention of the growth of defaulted debt is concerned? 
  [Vavilov] On the suggestion of the Bank of Russia, a 
calendar 
sequence of payments will be introduced. At present a debtor 
enterprise receiving funds for its products may dispose of them 
as it sees fit, allocating them, for example, to term deposits 
or conversion instead of paying the debt whereas in the 
immediate future, the enterprise will be able to dispose of the 
funds received only after it settles with the state and other 
creditors. Even the possibility of introducing a unified bank 
account with settlement, currency, deposit and other subaccounts 
is being considered as an extreme measure. Other, less radical 
scenarios for solving the problem are possible. However, control 
over the honoring of their obligations by enterprises will be 
restored, one way or another.

<F P=106> [Article by Professor Svyatoslav Fedorov: "If We Wish To </F>
Live Decently....: Five Conditions of Economic Stabilization"] 
  [Text] I am writing these lines several days after the 
program report of the president to the parliament of Russia, 
awaited by everyone, on most important questions of the 
salvation of the state. But even following Boris Nikolayevich's 
speech, I believe, the main questions of the country's 
development and its emergence from the crisis remain pertinent. 
Urgent, decisive, and unerring actions in order first of all to 
slow down and then to halt the decline in production are needed. 
A powerful drive mechanism is needed. Incentives to labor are 
needed. 
  Can the state today create the conditions for the most 
productive labor of each employee? Of course it can! But the 
following conditions, in my view, are needed for this. 
  The first and main condition is a fair evaluation 
of the labor of each employee. The utopian socialism of Lenin 
and Stalin collapsed because Soviet man's vested interest in the 
results of labor was incredibly low. Labor was essentially 
compulsory and differed little from camp labor. It has remained 
such today also, for that matter. Why work hard if this does not 
bring about a rise in the living standard? The individual's 
detachment from the profits he produces makes him indifferent to 
the very process of labor. And, on the other hand, a link with 
profits from joint labor engenders a desire to work with maximum 
input. This is easily achieved with the outfit's lease of the 
instruments of production or their transfer to joint ownership. 
It is very important in this case to fairly distribute the 
instruments of production shares. It is simple and efficient to 
divide them up according to length of service and pay over the 
past three or four years. When we retire, no one objects to this 
procedure then. Why not use it for the distribution of property? 
  A second version is possible also: the property remains 
state-owned, but is leased to the outfit for a symbolic fee. In 
a closed stock company collective property cannot be sold. There 
is for this reason just one way of living better--working hard 
and in high-quality fashion. But everyone should be confident 
that no one can appropriate the results of his labor and should 
for this know his percentage of the enterprise's monthly profits 
which it has been decided to transfer to the wage fund. 
Only the producers' vested interest in making a profit can 
raise productivity and labor quality. 
  The basis of market price regulation is competition. But 
what 
kind of competition can there be in a monopoly state-run economy 
other than competition between enterprises to raise prices? 
Whoever raises the most, as at an auction! 
  I am speaking about indisputable, rudimentary matters, about 
the thousand-fold tried-and-tested experience of economic 
development. But we, as always, have our own way. So the market 
train is idling beneath the magnificent arches of a station 
called Government Monopoly. 
  A unique situation has taken shape with us today. The 
executive has practically abandoned not only our property but 
also ourselves to the whim of the waves. Consequently, we need 
to persuade or compel the administrative-bureaucratic machinery 
to give back, finally, our property directly to the producers 
and citizens of Russia. We are all the legitimate, direct heirs 
of our fathers, grandfathers, and great grandfathers. 
Consequently, we are the owners of this property. There is no 
need to redeem it: Any plant recoups costs in several years. The 
years have passed, the plants have been redeemed. And who is to 
pay? For what? According to what law? After all, the state, 
represented by its bureaucratic machinery, cannot regard these 
means of production as its own private property. But it is being 
grabbed by those who are stronger and more impudent. 
  In order to change the slave mentality we need to afford the 
individual the opportunity to dispose of the fruits of his 
labor. Hand the plants, factories, institutes, and agricultural 
enterprises over to the people who want to work independently, 
are not afraid of risk, and believe in their own powers. They 
would work at full stretch and invent and apply the latest 
technology. They would work not eight but, if need be, 10 hours. 
They would cut back on their leave. It would not occur to them 
to stop production on holidays, and they would not think up new 
days off for themselves, as is the case now. What kind of people 
is it does, having made a hash of the economy, does not work for 
half a year just about?! 
  Today the government's statistical office shamefully does 
not 
report to us on how things stand with regard to productivity. 
But we know, in any case, that it has fallen sharply. And 
whatever reason our economists and political scientists give to 
explain this, one thing is clear: People no longer wish to plow 
for others, they wish to plow for themselves. So give them this 
opportunity! 
  Second condition. Having tackled the first, most 
important task, we will realize that this is insufficient. For 
the worker, even one owning property, can easily immediately be 
fleeced by taxes, being deprived of the opportunity to make a 
profit. We know how to suffocate with taxes, we have mastered 
this art well. It is difficult now to enumerate our taxes, they 
are more than 15, it seems. 
  The result is that we punish good work! Heck, we should have 
Genghis Khan, after all, his "yasak" [tribute] was only 
one-tenth, only 10 percent! His bureaucrat-brother, on the other 
hand, 70 percent! He does not understand, this sharp mind, that 
he is simply undermining the tax base itself, that he is cutting 
the branch on which he is sitting. That ultimately he will have 
nothing to collect from anyone. 
  It is essential that our authorities recognize that it 
is rich enterprises, rich works, and rich people who should be 
the basis of the country's budget. Let them replenish it 
with one tax--income tax--and social charges. Previously Russia 
lived with one tax--a poll tax--and that sufficed. The country's 
budget should be filled up also by customs duty, a land tax, a 
property tax, and a tax on the sale of raw material (under 
strict control, of course) since we are a country that is very 
rich in terms of material reserves. But collecting profits from 
moribund enterprises, factories, agricultural enterprises is the 
same as taking bread away from a participant in the Leningrad 
blockade. 
  Dying enterprises are a separate problem. They are on the 
point of declaring themselves bankrupt, and thousands upon 
thousands of workers and employees will be unemployed. We will 
have to pay them enormous sums from our money. But would it not 
be better today to exempt them from profits taxes and afford an 
opportunity for the rescue of the enterprises and rectification 
of their economic position? 
  Having become the proprietors, the work force should switch 
to a new type of remuneration of labor. We have over decades 
become used to obtaining remuneration for labor in the form of a 
certain ration. This does not work. The remuneration of the 
labor of each should be part of the income of the enterprise 
over a particular stretch of time, and at the end of the year, 
part of the profits used to pay dividends. Fairness in 
remuneration and economic glasnost are the basis of the high 
productivity, good conduct, and creative initiative of each 
member of the work force. 
  The third condition of success is the maximum 
encouragement of investments in production. A most 
important question of the efficient functioning of the economy 
is the creation of new technology and its purchase 
overseas. The government must contribute to this to the 
maximum. Customs duty on new technology should, therefore, be 
made purely symbolic. 
  Enormous investments are required for reequipping the plants 
and factories. According to the most modest estimates, 25 
percent of all industrial enterprises should be modernized. And 
this would cost a minimum of R1.5 quadrillion. The national 
budget, on the other hand, constitutes R120-130 trillion. 
Understandably, the state cannot cope with such a task with its 
forces. But it can create the conditions for large-scale 
investments of its own and overseas entrepreneurs. 
  Every year native entrepreneurs take $20-25 billion out of 
Russia. This money is going to develop the economies of Western 
countries, since investing it in production here is unprofitable 
(and unsafe: It is impossible to predict changes in the economic 
and political situation). 
  The entrepreneur needs dependability and stability. So he is 
taking his capital abroad. So the conclusion suggests itself: 
Modernization of the existing enterprises and the construction 
of new ones will only be a reality when it is more profitable 
for the investors to do this on our territory than in other 
countries. Investors should be the most esteemed people. They 
are truly the saviors of the fatherland from ultimate economic 
and moral collapse. I would recall that even in such 
economically developed countries as the United States any 
investor is wholly exempted from a tax on profits for three 
years, the local authorities help him obtain cheap credit, and 
he encounters a "green light" literally at every step. 
  The president and parliament are called upon to urgently 
pass 
a law on investments. This law must make the position of 
investors with us more favorable than in other countries. It is 
essential to exempt new enterprises from a tax on profits for 
five years, assist in the purchase of land, and guarantee the 
supply of energy, water, and other elements of the 
infrastructure. 
  Were we to create conditions whereby exporting dollars 
overseas would be an unprofitable business and they came to be 
invested in the development of industry in Russia, 500,000 jobs 
could be organized for this sum annually. And were we to add to 
this the investments of states and entrepreneurs from overseas, 
this could ward off the impending unemployment, and in politics, 
nationalism developing into fascism, for which a slump in 
production is the most nutrient medium. 
  The fourth condition of success is connected with 
the price of raw material. We are doggedly proclaiming our 
aspiration to move toward free world prices for raw material, 
without seeing, however, how dangerous this is for the 
development of our economy. Successful production is 
possible only where the price of raw material accords with the 
level of technology and the state infrastructure (roads, 
power engineering, transport, communications). So free world 
prices of raw material could simply strangle us. Our producer, 
still weak, could not create products which could compete in 
terms of price with the products of more developed countries. 
This is why it is necessary first to create an infrastructure 
similar to the world infrastructure and only then to gradually 
release the prices of raw material. 
  A tremendous stream of raw material is crossing our borders 
today, not the export product of our plants and factories. The 
borders should be closed to unchecked exports of raw material, 
and it is necessary for a transitional period to establish 
prices that afford an opportunity for making the products of our 
plants competitive. Currently, for example, the cost of the 
VAZ-21099 automobiles on the domestic market is $10,000, but 
overseas they sell for $3,500. It is not hard to understand that 
the plant costs of raw material (ore, metal, energy) are being 
covered from the pockets of our citizen. 
  It should, however, be made clear that there is also raw 
material whose exportation would be profitable to us in all 
respects. Thus there are on the Kola peninsula incalculable 
deposits of the dumping of apatite-cephalin production, with 
which our industry will never cope and which, moreover, are very 
harmful environmentally. Exports of these "tailings" or their 
development would be of great interest to many foreign 
companies. So total prohibition is needless here. But, in any 
event, it is essential prior to the achievement of normal market 
relations to monopolize exports of raw material exports in the 
hands of a specialized state committee under the strict control 
of the State Duma. 
  Fifth and final condition. The country cannot 
function normally without development of the infrastructure. 
This means transport arteries, power engineering, the banking 
system, communications. Substantial capital investments are 
needed here. No budget resources of ours would be sufficient for 
this. Consequently, investments in the infrastructure of 
the resources of private individuals, enterprises, and foreign 
entrepreneurs are needed. This applies primarily to means 
of communication, without which a market economy is impossible. 
  The absence of a market infrastructure is severely impeding 
the transition of the economy of barracks socialism to a market 
economy. The monopolization by the state, the bureaucratic 
machinery, in fact, of the entire infrastructure leads to the 
dictatorship of the official prices of energy, land, and 
transport. And for this reason not one self-respecting 
businessman will take the risk of production in our country. 
Mixed types of ownership in communications, transport, power 
engineering, and other sectors could ensure stable and 
competitive prices. 
  Free labor would afford an opportunity for breathing new 
life 
into agricultural production also. The countryside could obtain 
from the prosperous townsperson more money for agricultural 
produce. And this would make it possible to purchase equipment, 
fertilizer, and lubricants. But until such time as the mass 
prosperous townsperson appears, there will, of course, have to 
be substantial government financial infusions also. 
  All that has been said above could, perhaps, be summed up in 
just a few words. For a prosperous, decent life each of us must 
want to work hard. The results of our labor are our main private 
property. No one has the right to take away our profits without 
our consent. But instruments, machine tools, and premises are 
necessary for work. They would belong to us or be the property 
of the collective or partnership. Raw material should be cheap 
enough. It has, after all, been produced by nature, it is our 
common resource. Only in this case can we bring our producer 
onto the world market. 
  Generally, together with all, for the good of all. 
  A simple and precise formula. Why should it not be employed 
in our country?

<F P=106> [Article by Yevgeniy Tyurin, general director of the </F>
joint-stock company "Yarenergo": "Where Energy Disappears. A 
Director's View of Economic Policy in Russia"] 
  [Text] Everything on earth obeys the main law of 
nature--the law of energy conservation. It would not be bypassed 
or skirted. 
  Manufacturing lives by this law (as one of the forms of its 
manifestation) in the course of monetary servicing on the 
market. The formula is simple: The stock of goods times the 
price equals money times the velocity of circulation. It is 
impossible to violate this axiom. 
  However, it appears that there are people in our society 
who, 
having made it to large official suites, believe that they can 
amend the norms of existence ordained by nature. Having pulled a 
snow job on the people about the economy's being reoriented 
toward a worthy life, these reformers, who actually operated to 
narrowly corporate, mercenary ends, staged a big game under the 
name "economic reforms." 
  Well, the worthy life of the people is really ensured by an 
appropriate stock of goods. In the broad meaning of the word, 
this means an ecologically pure habitat, health care, dwellings, 
amenities in daily life and at the place of work, food, 
availability of services, and the spiritual content of life. 
  The goal of a society is to have an abundance of all of 
this. 
Just one question remains: How are we to arrive at such a 
supply? This is where the "reformers" disregarded the law of the 
conservation of energy. 
  Prices were decontrolled, and they shot up. Manufacturers 
did 
not profit by this, but rather the resellers and those above and 
around them did. The "reformers" calculated and "bolstered" this 
with requisite tax and price policies. 
  The results were not long in coming. Given the high prices 
for materials and subcontracted supplies for their products, 
manufacturers needed additional funds. Where were they to be 
had? Of course, at a bank, with interest. The firm financial 
policy immediately inflated the bank credit rate to 213 percent 
a year! Once again, those into whose pockets this interest 
flowed through the banks ended up in the money. 
  Let us move on. One must manufacture and sell his products 
very quickly in order to maintain manufacturing in the 
environment of high prices and a shortage of money. However, the 
"fathers of the reform" had thought about this move, too. 
Someone arranged things so that the processing of payments was 
slowed down to infinity. The funds retained by the banks were 
put to use yet again, and once again contributed to the profits 
of those who were originators of the "reformist idea" in 
question. 
  However, the aforementioned sources of profiteering are but 
a 
secondary product of the excesses in the transformation of the 
economy. The primary, key result of experimentation with the 
country can be deduced from the already mentioned enduring 
equality of the energy balance in nature, and then in the 
opposite sense. 
  The essence of it is such: Strictly in keeping with the law 
of the conservation of energy, a small amount of money times the 
low velocity of circulation divided by high prices brings 
manufacturing to zero (to being wound down and destroyed). This 
means loss of jobs and mass unemployment first, and subsequently 
the hemorrhaging of intellectual, highly skilled labor and the 
consistent reduction of the nation to a source of primitive 
labor on the world labor market. The disintegration of the state 
follows inevitably. 
  I will say frankly that I do not believe in the ability of 
the presidential structures and the government to effectively 
adjust the economic course being pursued without coercion by the 
entire people. The repeated collective proposals by 
manufacturers from many regions of the country to the government 
to cooperate in developing and implementing a creative economic 
policy, made in vain over a period of two years, are grounds for 
my mistrust. 
  So, is everything lost, and are we doomed as a nation? I 
believe that there still is an opportunity for rebirth, 
provided, of course, that we take immediate action to preserve 
the fruitful energy of the nation. 
  First. Manufacturers representing all forms of 
ownership should unite around the banner of the Federation of 
Manufacturers of Russia (FTR) for joint, organized actions in 
the name of bringing back domestic manufacturing at a new 
scientific-technical level, and should support the declaration 
of the Second Congress of Manufacturers. 
  Second. The Federal Assembly and the FTR should 
proclaim 1994 the year of a people's revision of economic 
reforms. 
  Third. Having invited the administrations and 
deputies, the FTR and public organizations should organize the 
development of proposals for revising credit-financial, tax, 
price, and customs policies throughout the country. 
  Fourth. The government and the FTR should refine 
and release to the public procedures for the collection of 
proposals, their honest processing, and open and systematic 
analysis with a view to adopting a people's law on a long-term 
economic policy. 
  Fifth. Having invited public organizations, 
sectoral associations, and state structures, the FTR should 
immediately embark on organizing intrasectoral and intersectoral 
negotiations on putting price-setting in order. Special 
attention should be paid to setting the maximum cost of 
intermediary services regardless of the number of consecutive 
resales. 
  It appears to me that the following three principles should 
form the foundation of the agreements, among other principles. 
The ratios of prices for goods and services may not differ 
substantially from those at the world level. Prices for natural 
resources as export products may not be lower than world-market 
prices (in this instance, labor, minerals, soils, the natural 
flora and fauna, water, and air should be considered the 
original reference). Finally, the cost of labor as a proportion 
of all products should be approximately in line with that in the 
world for a similar stock of merchandise. 
  Such negotiations with the structures of federal power will 
certainly be difficult. The development of fundamental legal 
provisions for revising the reforms will certainly run into 
contradictions, into mutually exclusive arguments. One point is 
clear: The speeding flywheel of inflation will not be stopped in 
the absence of nationwide accord. If we fail to pool together 
the creative energy of Russians and channel it toward 
life-giving pursuits, within the shortest possible period of 
time we will be doomed as a nation and as a state. 
  P.S. I finished writing this letter on 5 February. On 15 
February, I read information in your newspaper according to 
which Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin had come out for holding 
intersectoral price-setting negotiations. I mention this because 
otherwise it would turn out to be improper: I would appear to be 
plagiarizing Chernomyrdin's ideas.

<F P=106> [Interview with Economist Yevgeniy Yasin by Galina </F>
Kovalskaya, NOVOYE VREMYA correspondent; date and place not 
given: "The Basic Reforms are Already Behind"] 
  [Text] The well-known economist Yevgeniy Yasin has 
given a regular quarterly interview to NOVOYE VREMYA. 
  [Kovalskaya] The new year has been marked by changes in the 
composition of the government. The rhetoric has also changed at 
once: on practically all levels the talk is about strengthening 
state monitoring, state regulation. This is all but the basic 
motive in the president's message to the Duma. Are there not 
threats to the reforms here? 
  [Yasin] Strengthening of state power in Russia is totally 
necessary. And I can only welcome such intentions. We have spent 
two years under conditions of the continuous weakening of the 
state, which has been related also to the political 
situation--the disintegration of the Union, the strengthening of 
separatism within Russia, the replacement of the ruling elite, 
and to the economic reform, since the liberation of economic 
subjects under our conditions has inevitably also turned into 
the weakening of legal control. 
  Privatization was the main thing in the first stage of the 
economic transformations. This task has been basically resolved. 
The mechanism has been started up and the further course of 
privatization depends already on the economic and social 
conditions in the country. So the task of consolidating state 
institutions or, in other words, of maintaining order is now 
advancing to the forefront. Effective functioning of the 
militia, the tax inspectorate, customs houses and investigatory 
and judicial organs is required. 
  Let's take the problem of non-payments, one of the most 
acute 
social problems--the consequence not so much of stringent 
financial policy as of the absence of the monitoring of money 
flows. Entrepreneurial activity is being held in check not only 
by inflation but also by the unprecedented scope of criminality 
and corruption. These costs in the form of chaos and lack of 
control, obviously, are inevitable. But in the same way the 
struggle with them, moreover on the state level, is also 
inevitable. 
  However, another fear is expressed in your question: will 
not 
a strengthening of the interference of the state in the economy 
according to formulations like those our respected academicians 
proposed take place? Will they not try to return to price 
regulations and to close up the economy? This would really bring 
nothing but harm. I think that in the goverment they understand 
that such measures would be a retreat from the reforms. 
  Perhaps I will now surprise you. However, I think that the 
reforms are on the whole already behind us. The main thing has 
been done: prices have been liberalized, the economy has been 
opened up, and privatization is almost completed. Now one needs 
to preserve all this and to proceed further along specific 
institutional directions. It's right here that a strong and 
effective state is required. 
  For example, the question of optimizing the management of 
state enterprises has been on the agenda since the middle of 
1992. It was talked about in the Gaydar program for the 
intensification of economic reforms. There is nothing 
anti-market here: an enterprise cannot operate efficiently if it 
is not controlled by the owner. Since the owner in this case is 
the state, so there should be state control. 
  In everything else the level of state interference in the 
economy ought to come down to promulgating good laws and 
providing the mechanisms for their operation. 
  [Kovalskaya] How strongly will the departure of the 
reformers 
from the government strike at reform? 
  [Yasin] Let's get used to the fact that the time of simple 
solutions and unequivocal evaluations has passed. I'm by no 
means delighted with the new composition of the cabinet. I very 
much regret the departure of Boris Fedorov, even more than the 
departure of Gaydar. At the same time I think that Gaydar has 
done his own very important part in the matter and already other 
people will be able to accomplish the rest. But to read the 
burial service over the reform and to call Chernomyrdin an 
anti-reformer, as many mass information media have been doing in 
recent months, is both incorrect and simply harmful in my 
opinion. 
  [Kovalskaya] At the end of last year the government was 
getting ready to begin the clearing up of the finances of 
insolvent enterprises and the appropriate preparatory work had 
been done. Will this now be given up? 
  [Yasin] As far as I can judge feelings are rather firm, in 
any case for the prime-minister. But the question is very 
difficult and is connected with the fate of millions of people. 
All the talk that bankruptcy will not lead to the closing of an 
enterprise is no more than an attempt to comfort. In the 
overwhelming majority of cases, bankruptcy inevitably should 
lead precisely to the closing of an enterprise. Otherwise, it 
makes no economic sense. 
  In a normal situation the question of bankruptcy is not a 
state question. It is the creditors who are not being paid who 
should initiate legal proceedings in regard to their partners. 
But in reality this is not yet occuring among us. There is no 
financial discipline, not even an understanding that this is the 
case. The new stockholders don't yet know their rights and don't 
know how to fight for them. State interference is apparently 
necessary in this situation. 
  As for state enterprises, no legal proceedings whatever are 
needed here at all. And a bankruptcy law is not necessary. All 
this talk last year that, they say, our hands are tied since 
there is no bankruptcy law is groundless. An owner has a right 
to manage his own property as he sees fit. In reality another 
thing brought it to a standstill: a well-founded fear of social 
explosion. 
  You can't avoid the sorting out of insolvent enterprises. 
This is becoming a question of survival. Meager financial 
resources are being spread thin. As a result both promising and 
unpromising economic subjects find themselves under the same 
atttack. A stratagem for redistributing budget funds is 
required. Only efficient enterprises should be supported. By the 
way, not only state but private. 
  I call attention to this especially, since a stereotype has 
taken root among us that the business of the state is only the 
state sector. So the criterion here should be efficiency and not 
the form of ownership. Especially as it is difficult with 
certainty to call enterprises like Uralmash just now made 
joint-stock companies private. They somehow occupy an 
intermediate niche. 
  [Kovalskaya] The ruble exchange rate sometimes stabilizes, 
sometimes suddenly, as this week, falls spasmodically. What is 
this related to? 
  [Yasin] It's very good to have a stable national currency. 
It 
is an indicator of the economy's health. But artificial support 
of a currency's stability in an unhealthy economy leads to 
nothing good. The stablilization of the exchange rate last 
year--the consequence of a stringent monetary policy--is the 
direct service of Boris Fedorov. Jumps are a reaction to the 
growth of prices. 
  Why doesn't a smooth increase occur? Because the conduct of 
the agents of the currency market is determined by two 
circumstances: on the one hand the physical shortage of rubles 
and on the other--the approach of internal Russian prices to 
world prices, so that the dollar also ceases to be a reliable 
means for storing money. 
  The special feature of our financial situation is that the 
dollar exchange rate, despite all the jumps, is nevertheless 
growing slower than internal prices. The fact is that in recent 
years the circle of strictly market enterprises (commercial 
banks and production units directly related to import and 
export), which very quickly and economically adequately reacts 
to stringent financial policy, has been set apart. They also are 
the basic agents on the currency exchange. 
  But those producers which basically establish consumer 
prices, wholesale and retail, in their mass are far less mobile, 
more "socialistically" oriented, inclined to pay wages first and 
then debts. That is why prices in the country react slower to 
financial policy than to the ruble exchange rate. 
  [Kovalskaya] It turns out that our inflation also is really 
not related to monetary policy and the Abalkin-Shatalin-Petrakov 
group is right? 
  [Yasin] In no circumstances can one give up a stringent 
financial policy. But the talk about "cost inflation" instead of 
"demand inflation" is altogether unfounded. Inflation always is 
urged on by both demand and by costs. The one reinforces the 
other. But here it is, of course, necessary to pay attention to 
the structural factors which provoke the growth of inflation. 
  Consequently, we again return to the strengthening of the 
role of the state. Who thought to what extent our inflation was 
caused by the fact that taxes are not being collected? Or by 
corruption? Or by the lack of currency control? 
  [Kovalskaya] Are these really feasible tasks? Some 
presidents 
in the near abroad proclaimed the struggle with corruption their 
basic task and the disintegration of even those poorly operating 
structures which were there merely occured as a result. 
  [Yasin] Of course, the best method of fighting corruption is 
a liberal economy and regulation of the functions of bureaucrats 
and departments. However, one also cannot attempt to suppress 
corruption and arbitrariness by forceful methods, with the help 
of the law, the militia, the tax inspectorate, and customs 
houses--the impunity in such cases completely demoralizes 
society. 
  For example, an appropriate economic policy is needed first 
of all to stop the export of currency abroad: an increase in the 
interest rates on deposits. But currency control, which not a 
single state can do without, is also necessary. 
  Corruption, I am certain, will not decline in Russia until 
privatization is completed, and until state property is either 
pilfered or plundered. But this does not mean that deliberate 
connivance is permissible. 
  [Kovalskaya] Everyone is anxious about the impending 
reunification of monetary systems with Belarus. One of the 
sorest subjects is that Belarus for the last two years has 
stubbornly not liberated prices and has "maintained production." 
How are we now to unite while in fact taking on the maintenance 
of their unprofitable enterprises? Or to succeed in insisting on 
the liberation of Belarus's internal prices? 
  [Yasin] I'm not sure. But didn't you notice that the fact is 
that prices are also regulated in Russia? Only not on the state 
level, but by the local authorities. In Moscow, for example, 
Luzhkov holds down the prices for gasoline and for many 
products. The local leaders do this in a majority of oblasts. 
  There are oblasts that are record-holders in the regulation 
of prices like Ulyanovsk and Orel oblasts. In my view they are 
acting more reasonably in Nizhniy Novgorod, where the prices are 
completely free and compensation is paid to the poor. However, 
the government is very wise in not interfering in the internal 
affairs of the regions. Imagine if the inhabitants of Ulyanovsk 
Oblast, who are terribly proud of the low prices in their 
stores, suddenly found out that "from the top" they are 
prohibiting the freezing of prices? 
  Let the population itself rather react to the disappearance 
of goods from the counters and to the inevitable setting of 
norms for products, or enterprises rebel against the additional 
tribute which the oblast assesses them in order to be able to 
hold on to low prices. 
  I think that Belarus also, if the unification of finances 
takes place, will find itself in the position of an oblast in 
which prices are being regulated on the regional level. Ten 
million strong, Belarus will not inflict catastrophic damage on 
the Russian economy. 
  [Kovalskaya] In December the country lived through a series 
of strikes. A new bout of the strike fever is now beginning. 
What, in your view, is the optimal conduct strategy with respect 
to strikes? 
  [Yasin] I personally think that one should display great 
severity precisely towards those who try to take the country by 
the throat: the power industry workers, the transport workers. 
Of course, for a state order, once this obligation has been 
thoughtlessly undertaken by the government it needs to be paid 
for at the proper time. However, under no circumstances whatever 
should the government clear off from the budget the indebtedness 
of enterprises that are users of coal or other energy resources. 
  That these same miners have a right to demand certain 
actions 
from the government is another matter. To close unprofitable 
mines and to resettle people from the North to the 
mainland--these are all just and reasonable desires. Very little 
is being done in this direction as yet. The World Bank will 
grant money for modernization of the coal industry but we are 
still not able to use it. 
  One should respond in the right way not to intensive 
pressure 
but to the needs of those groups like invalids and single 
mothers who cannot stand up for themselves.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yevgeniy Lenskiy, adviser to the first </F>
deputy prime minister, by Aleksandr Golyayev; place and date not 
given: "An Answer to Wastefulness"] 
  [Text] For almost a year a group of experts headed by 
government First Deputy Chairman Oleg Soskovets has been working 
on the problem of creating financial-industrial groups (FPGs). 
Why has this process, of all others, attracted the government's 
attention? Yevgeniy Lenskiy, an adviser to the first deputy 
prime minister, answers this question. 
  [Lenskiy] In our difficult conditions it became necessary to 
implement such production maneuvers as changing the production 
profile, organizational restructuring of industrial sectors and 
enterprises with precedence given to the development of the 
nonstate sector. Under these circumstances, there is a shift 
from an expenditure-based economy to a system of sectors and 
enterprises, which produce, on the basis of new technologies, 
the output everybody needs. 
  [Golyayev] What general economic tasks are being resolved in 
the course of such a maneuver? 
  [Lenskiy] First and foremost, the fastest possible 
overcoming 
of the production decline on a, so to say, noninflationary 
basis. This is probably the most important point. 
  [Golyayev] Is there a mechanism for resolving this problem? 
  [Lenskiy] This involves a series of economic measures, among 
which one of the most important is to create conditions that 
stimulate natural market changes in the structure of goods 
produced and hence change the proportional weight of different 
economic sectors. The meaning of the maneuver is not a 
state-directed structural restructuring of industry from above, 
but the state creating conditions whereby old enterprises 
undergoing transformation along with newly-emerging private 
enterprises build product markets along technological chains of 
demand and supply. 
  An FPG is one of such mechanisms for implementing Russian 
industrial policy. You see, it would be wrong to change the 
"rules of the game" in the implementation of the privatization 
program. This does not mean, however, that issues of adjustments 
to the privatization policy are no longer on the agenda. Today, 
in my opinion, it is mainly aimed at excessive fragmentation of 
production and cannot result in the creation of a modern market 
economy. I support the proposals of those who propose a course 
toward the creation of large FPGs that will be competitive in 
the world market, rather than creating internal competition at 
the cost of a sharp decline of effectiveness of the national 
economy. What is needed are groups of enterprises linked 
together financially and technologically, exercising precise 
planning of joint work, interacting with scientific and design 
organizations. At the same time, we should avoid conglomeration 
of enterprises making similar products--along the pattern of a 
ministry or a main administration. What is needed are 
associations competing with each other. 
  [Golyayev] They say that there are different opinions 
regarding financial-industrial groups... 
  [Lenskiy] The people who do not accept FPGs are those who 
know a plant or a shop only from textbook descriptions. This is 
not serious. I support those who believe that we can no longer 
put up with the fact that ministries and agencies are virtually 
removed from the processes of reforming enterprises, their 
privatization, forming the vitally needed market infrastructure, 
influence over the consumer market. The role of the state should 
be in facilitating the development of financial and legal norms, 
personnel training, and other infrastructure-related activities. 
  In addition, the idea of organizing large quasi-government 
multisectoral associations also sprang up among Russian 
industrialists. 
  In the summer of last year, First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg 
Soskovets signed a directive, which envisaged creating a 
commission on the development of a "variant concept for 
implementation of industrial policy in the environment of 
privatization of state property." It is a long title, but the 
substance of the document is quite simple: creating conditions 
for setting up multisectoral industrial groups. The role of the 
state also is clearly delineated: not to force the process of 
FPG formation, but to monitor it, cut off the unneeded. 
  There have been many drafts, including those from the State 
Committee on Industry, the State Committee for the 
Administration of State Property, the Committee on Machine 
Building, the Property Fund, and so-called independent experts. 
An attempt to reject constructive alternatives and to present 
the current industrial policy as the only true and possible one 
represents, in our opinion, the most dangerous form of 
monopolization, which blocks the road to the development of a 
rational strategy of reforms. That is why the work on perfecting 
the FPG concept continued, the final result of which was the 
president's edict. 
  [Golyayev] What do we currently have in real life? 
  [Lenskiy] An amazing thing. The state is interested in it; 
corresponding normative documents have been adopted; and at the 
same time one gets the impression that someone is benefiting 
from slowing down this process. Judge for yourself: In order to 
"legitimize" creation of FPGs, concurrence of almost 10 
ministries and agencies is needed. One would think it should be 
simple: band together and start working. At this point, however, 
it is impossible to "push through" the needed concurrence. Half 
a year has passed, but not a single FPG has acquired the status 
of a legitimate entity registered in a corresponding registry. 
  Plans are being developed on a broader scale as well. The 
main efforts in the integration processes of CIS member 
countries may be placed on interstate transnational corporations 
and financial-industrial groups formed on a share-holding basis 
and representing the entire complex of business services. 
  We would like very much to move from talk to action. I am 
not 
a supporter of campaigning, but let 1994 become a year for 
forming Russian and transnational FPGs, corporations, and other 
integrating entities. 
  Otherwise, foreign transnational corporations will suppress 
Russian industrial structures, with the exception perhaps of 
those in the raw materials sector. Russian citizens will hardly 
be happy with this.

<F P=106> [Article by M. Kozlovskiy, under the rubric "Individuals": </F>
"Slippery Shokhin: Political Agility as a Means of Fighting a 
Decent Reputation"] 
  [Text] The only representative of power to have met with 
former U.S. President Nixon, between the latter's meetings with 
Mr. Rutskoy and Mr. Zhirinovskiy, as it happened, was RF 
[Russian Federation] Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin. One 
can guess that this meeting was scarcely at Mr. Shokhin's 
personal initiative; however, the fact that it was he who was 
selected for this mission reflected the position he has landed 
in the government, due largely to his own initiative. 
  Aleksandr Shokhin remains one of the most tenacious 
ministers 
in the Russian government. He was invited by Ivan Silayev to 
occupy the post of labor minister, held on in the transition 
administration of Acting Premier Oleg Lobov, and entered 
organically as one of the key vice premiers into the "reform 
cabinet," where, as we know, he headed up the economic bloc. 
Despite his early manifested inclination toward extreme 
political tenacity, Mr. Shokhin was long considered one of the 
most literate and powerful reformers on the "Gaydar team," on 
which he occupied a special, relatively independent position. 
  By the way, when Aleksandr Shokhin, as the first of the 
"renegade reformers," began to pronounce unintelligible texts 
"on the need to strengthen the social orientation of the 
reforms" on the eve of the elections, it reminded us mostly of 
cheap demagoguery: it reminded us that during the first period 
of reforms the social bloc's former chief could boast of a 
single merit--he held on tenaciously to that same "social 
protection" and blamed the government for its lack. 
  Without dwelling on the reasons that brought Mr. Shokhin 
into 
the "Shakhray party," it should be noted that he entered quite 
organically into the role of economic ideologue. His theoretical 
constructs were limited to hints at a poorly digested "centrism" 
in the spirit of the Civic Union, and his practical attacks 
against government policy pursued the goal of toying with 
Russia's Choice. Mr. Shokhin's membership in the PRES [Party of 
Russian Unity and Accord] and even, to some extent, his 
supremacy in that party might seem surprising at first. However, 
he quickly achieved "unity and accord" with his colleagues on 
the basis of a single ideological paradigm that linked the party 
to absolute political spinelessness. From this standpoint, each 
of the PRES leaders has his own special merits: Mr. Shakhray, 
who virtually ensured passage of the criminal resolution 
granting amnesty to the organizers of the state coup due to 
extenuating circumstances; Mr. Zatulin, a petty trade-finance 
middleman implicated in petty machinations who has now attained 
petty power and who long reviled in the press the very people 
and politics with which he now willingly formed a bloc. 
  As for the "intelligent and competent" Mr. Shokhin, he along 
with his comrades in his party, willingly agreed to the 
suggestion to join a government formed on the very basis of 
their party's defeat in the elections. By the way, we should 
mention the fact that it was Mr. Shokhin who brought in Mr. 
Melikyan to take over the newly freed up chair of the head of 
the RF Ministry of Labor. Mr. Melikyan is now willingly and 
extensively developing both in public and in his practical 
activities his patron's most demagogic ideological findings. 
  Once he took over Russia's Ministry of Economics, Aleksandr 
Shokhin attempted to proclaim it the key economic department, 
empowered to carry out the purposeful state regulation of the 
economy. Thus he attempted virtually to commandeer the legacy of 
Mr. Lobov, an act that ought to have been considered utterly 
shameful for the "economist-reformer." 
  I will make the proviso that Mr. Shokhin's undoubted service 
was his extremely harsh position at the negotiations with 
Western partners and international financial organizations on 
the issues of their economic "assistance" and Russia's foreign 
debt. However, Mr. Shokhin has been virtually dismissed from 
these duties, and he is not going to be allowed, or so it seems, 
to render any such benefit in his new field of endeavor. 
  The administration seems to have made the most radical 
reform 
decision of recent years by taking away from the Economics 
Ministry the monumental quarters of the old USSR Gosplan [State 
Planning Committee]. Soviet-Russian bureaucratic practice shows 
that, after something like this, "great institutions," as a 
rule, are not restored. So that once again they have, as they 
say, wiped their feet on Mr. Shokhin. 
  The new economics minister's highly developed agility is 
becoming a threat to his own professional reputation: unlike Mr. 
Soskovets or Mr. Chernomyrdin, he cannot fail to be aware of the 
content of his new economic illuminations. By the way, in his 
conversation with President Nixon, Aleksandr Shokhin accused 
Premier Chernomyrdin of excessive monetarism in connection with 
February's indecently low rates of inflation. In a recent 
interview, former Finance Minister Boris Fedorov proposed that 
Mr. Shokhin's next post be minister of health care. However, if 
Aleksandr Shokhin is going to treat himself as carefully in the 
future as he has so far, then he might boldly count on occupying 
the chair of deputy minister of health care.

Output and Price Dynamics as of 5 March"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Prices for Goods and Services </H5>
  Over the period 28 February to 5 March 1994 prices for 
consumer goods and services rose by 1.7 percent, including those 
for foodstuffs and nonfood items--by 1.5 percent, and for-fee 
services for the population--by 4.8 percent. Food prices rose at 
a higher rate (by 2.5-4 percent) in the Northwestern and Volga 
regions and Kaliningrad Oblast; in the cities of the Far East 
prices remained practically unchanged. 
  Consumer market indices of prices for consumer goods and 
services were as follows (as a percentage of the preceding date): 


                 02/22       02/28       03/05       Average daily price rise

  Since the beginning of the year prices for goods and 
services 
have increased by 35.7 percent, including for foodstuffs--by 
34.4 percent, nonfood items--by 25.6 percent, and for-fee 
services for the population--2.1-fold. 
  Foodstuffs. Over the first five days of March 
prices in organized and unorganized trade rose at practically 
the same rate--1.5 percent and 1.9 percent. 
  Price changes by main categories of food products over the 
period 28 February to 5 March are shown below:

  [Text] In organized trade over the first days of March 
prices went 
up by 5-9 percent for basic varieties of bread and bakery 
products and some varieties of fruit and vegetables. Milk and 
milk products prices increased by 3-4 percent. Prices for 
butter, vegetable oil, meat products, eggs, and sugar remained 
practically unchanged. Prices for oranges and vodka decreased by 
1-3 percent. 
  In nonorganized trade the greatest price increases were 
registered with respect to fresh cabbage--by 9.5 percent, 
milk--by 5 percent, potatoes, beets, and carrots--by 2-3 percent. 
  The cost of the consumer basket of 19 basic foodstuffs rose 
over the week by 2.4 percent and as of 5 March amounted to 
42,300 rubles [R], calculated on a monthly basis. The price 
differential between monitored cities measured a factor of 3.7. 
Moscow is in 35th place of 132 monitored cities (R46,000 on a 
monthly basis). 
  Nonfood items. Over the period 28 February to 5 
March prices for medicines increased by 2.3 percent; those for 
fabrics, sewn items, and knitwear rose by 1.5-1.7 percent, and 
for footwear--by 0.6 percent. 
  For-fee services for the population. Service fees 
rose by 4.8 percent over the period under review. Rents in 
municipal housing went up by 25 percent, and hot water supply 
rates--by almost 20 percent. The cost of some varieties of 
consumer services, urban bus fares, and the cost of keeping a 
child in a preschool facility went up by 5-8 percent. 
<H5>  Cost of Raw and Manufactured Input Materials </H5>
  The Russian State Committee on Statistics has summarized the 
current data on the level and dynamics of average prices of 
purchasing 170 categories of basic raw and manufactured input 
materials obtained from a selected sample of enterprises in 
industry and construction. The average price includes, in 
addition to production cost, transportation and selling 
expenses, taxes and excise taxes. 
  Prices for raw and manufactured input materials purchased by 
enterprises increased in February of this year by 13 percent as 
compared to January, including those purchased from suppliers 
within Russia--by 12 percent, from CIS countries--by 22 percent, 
and from foreign countries--by 16 percent (wholesale prices for 
industrial output increased by 16 percent in February of this 
year as compared to January 1994). Over two months of the 
current year, prices for raw and manufactured input materials 
purchased by industrial users increased by 34 percent 
(industrial producers' wholesale prices--by 37 percent). 
  The cost of construction materials increased at a greater 
rate. Over the month prices for materials purchased by 
construction contractor organizations rose by 26 percent, and 
since the beginning of the year--by 51 percent. Wholesale prices 
of construction materials producers increased by 16 percent and 
40 percent, respectively. 
  Purchase price dynamics by main categories of raw and 
manufactured input materials are characterized by the following 
data: 


                         as % of the preceding month        February 1994 
                                                            as % of

  Purchase prices for fuel rose over the month by 13 percent, 
including for oil--by 19 percent, natural gas--by 14 percent, 
boiler oil and diesel fuel--by 15-18 percent. Oil refining 
industry enterprises purchased oil in February on average at 
R80,000 per tonne (production cost--R52,000). The price of 
natural gas used in electric power generation amounted on 
average to R32,000 per thousand cubic meters (production 
price--R3,200); the average price of coal used in power 
generation--R19,000, and coal for coking--R50,000 per tonnes, 
with a production price on average across Russia of R13,000. 
  Purchase prices for raw and manufactured input materials 
differ depending on the supplier. For instance, it was cheaper 
for Russian producers to purchase conversion pig iron, iron ore, 
certain varieties of rolled metal, flax fiber, and granulated 
sugar from CIS member countries suppliers than on the domestic 
market. At the same time, coal and some varieties of synthetic 
thread and fiber were purchased from suppliers in near abroad 
countries at higher prices. 
  Purchase prices differed considerably by region. For 
instance, the purchase price of lumber for Ivanovo Oblast 
enterprises amounted to R76 million per 1,000 cubic meters of 
solid wood, and in Rostov Oblast--R92 million. Food-processing 
enterprises in Krasnodar Kray purchased vegetable oil at 
R735,000, and in Sverdlovsk Oblast--R1,496,000 per tonne. Cement 
prices ranged from R96,000 in Amur Oblast to R19,000 per tonne 
in Smolensk Oblast (with an average for Russia price of 
R37,000). In the Central region the highest level of purchase 
prices for basic construction materials was registered in Moscow 
and Moscow Oblast. 
  Higher freight rates (by 15 percent in February as compared 
to January of this year) led to increased transportation 
expenses for enterprises in industry and construction. Last 
month freight expenses at surveyed industrial enterprises and 
construction contractor organizations amounted on average to 12 
percent of the cost of purchased raw and manufactured input 
materials. Transportation expenses comprise more than 
one-quarter of the purchase price of commercial timber; apatite 
concentrate--more than 40 percent; road metal and sand--about 50 
percent; cement, asphalt-concrete mix, asbestos-cement sheets, 
and construction brick--more than 15 percent. 
<H5>  Industrial Production </H5>
  In January-February of this year Russian industry produced 
almost R34 trillion worth of output in current prices, including 
R18 trillion worth in February. As compared to last 
January-February, the physical volume of production declined by 
23.6 percent, including by 23.1 percent in January and 24.1 
percent in February. 
  The volume of average daily production (as a percentage of 
the preceding month, without taking into account seasonal 
factors) amounted to: February--105 percent; January--89 
percent; December 1993--103.7 percent; and November--97 percent. 
  In January-February 1994, of the 406 most important 
categories of products counted in periodic reports, the 
production volume of 37 items increased as compared to 
January-February of 1993, and of 362 items--declined. 
  In the fuel and power generation sectors, the volume of 
electric power generation declined by 4 percent in 
January-February of this year as compared to January-February of 
last year. Over two months of this year, oil production amounted 
to 50.5 million tonnes, including gas condensate, which is 13 
percent less than in January-February of 1993; 50.3 million 
tonnes of coal (8 percent less), and 109 billion cubic meters of 
gas (the same level as over the same two months last year). 
  In ferrous metallurgy in January-February of this year the 
lag as compared to the corresponding period of last year 
amounted to: with respect to pig iron output--20 percent; 
steel--26 percent; production of finished rolled metal--22 
percent; and that of steel pipe--48 percent. 
  In January of this year the output of half of the monitored 
items in machine-building amounted to 50 percent or less of that 
for the corresponding period of last year (metal-cutting machine 
tools, drop forge machines, bulldozers, freight railcars, 
tractors, trucks, grain and fodder harvesting combines, and 
others). 
  In the chemical and petrochemical industry, production of 
most varieties of the most important categories of output 
continued to fall in February. Over the two months as a whole, 
production of synthetic ammonia declined by 26 percent, sulfuric 
acid--by 30 percent, calcinated soda--by 53 percent, mineral 
fertilizer--by 29 percent, chemical thread and fiber--by 49 
percent, and automotive tires--by 41 percent. Production of 
pipeline pipe and components made of thermoplastics, as well as 
fiberglass and items made of it, declined by more than one half, 
and of chemical insecticides and pesticides--by two-thirds. 
Output of tires for agricultural vehicles amounted to less than 
one-third of last year's. 
  In the timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper industry 
average daily output of wood-chip panels, window and door 
frames, and garden homes increased in February as compared to 
January. At the same time, the output of commercial timber fell 
in January-February of this year by more than one-third as 
compared to the corresponding period of last year, of lumber--by 
30 percent, laminated plywood--by 22 percent, mine props and 
wooden transportation containers--by more than one-half, and 
prefabricated homes made of wood--by three-quarters. 
  In the pulp and paper industry, production of paper and 
cardboard declined as compared to January-February of last year 
by 22 percent and 39 percent. The output of newsprint was 20 
percent greater than last year. 
  In the construction materials industry in January-February 
of 
this year, as compared to the same period of last year, 
production of cement declined by 35 percent, soft roofing and 
insulation materials--by 43 percent, brick--by 24 percent, and 
window glass--by 33 percent. Output of preassembled 
ferroconcrete, wall materials, linoleum, porous fillers, and 
decorative ceramic tile dropped by 22-29 percent, 
asbestos-cement pipes and couplers, high-grade asbestos, and 
mineral cotton--by 43-62 percent, and of roof slate--by 72 
percent. 
  Production of consumer goods in January-February 1994 
declined as compared to the analogous period last year by 27 
percent, including that of nonfood items--by 31 percent, and 
foodstuffs--by 17 percent. 
  In light industry there was a decline in output of hosiery 
and knitwear--by 27 percent, footwear--by 54 percent, woolen 
fabrics--by 53 percent, silk fabrics by--61 percent, and linen 
fabrics and sack cloth--by 45 percent. Production of cotton 
fabrics increased by 22 percent. 
  In January-February of this year, as compared to the same 
period of last year, there was a considerable decline in 
production of most garment industry items: coats and short 
coats--by two-thirds; jackets, raincoats, suits, slacks, and 
skirts--by almost one-half; and shirts and dresses--by 22-28 
percent. 
  Shortage of working capital and difficulties in selling 
output because of high prices remain the main causes of 
production decline. 
  In the production of complex home appliances, over the 
elapsed period of the year there was a decline in the production 
of: refrigerators and freezers--by 2 percent, washing 
machines--by 42 percent, tape recorders--by 56 percent, 
television sets--by 17 percent, and porcelain, stoneware, and 
majolica tableware--by 22 percent. 
  Compared to the corresponding period of last year, the 
output 
of two- and three-chamber refrigerators and freezers increased 
in January-February of this year. 
  Among the most important food items whose output increased 
in 
January-February 1994 as compared to the corresponding period of 
last year are high-fat cheeses and feta cheese, mayonnaise, and 
canned tomato products. Production of canned milk products and 
vegetable oil remained practically at last year's level. 
  With respect to most foodstuffs, the volume of production 
declined as compared to January-February 1993: meat--by 26 
percent, whole-milk products--by 17 percent, butter--by 31 
percent, flour--by 17 percent, and cereals--by 34 percent. 
  Considerably less macaroni items, lump sugar, starch, and 
food concentrates (37-50 percent), confectionery items, and 
baker's yeast (15-20 percent) was produced than last year. 
Output of bread and bakery production declined by 13 percent. 
  Production of vodka and other hard liquor amounted to only 
one-half of that over January-February of 1993; in February it 
amounted to 44 percent. 
  Since the beginning of the year, production of manufactured 
feed concentrate dropped by more than one-quarter, and output of 
protein and vitamin feed additives amounted to only 14 percent 
of last year's volume. 
  Enterprise and production stoppages. In February 
of this year 4,300 enterprises in Russia experienced lengthy 
complete or partial stoppages of production; the loss of work 
time amounted to 22 million man-days, or 18 percent of scheduled 
clocked time of these enterprises (in February, 2,400 
enterprises experienced shortages; 6 million man-days were lost, 
or 8.6 percent of scheduled clocked time of these enterprises). 
  At enterprises experiencing shortages, 22 percent of the 
labor force was sent on additional unpaid or partially paid 
leave in February at the administration's initiative (8 percent 
in February 1993). 
  Over the elapsed month, 28 enterprises in the fuel industry 
were on strike; as a result, 60,000 man-days of work time were 
lost. 
<H5>  The Consumer Market </H5>
  According to preliminary data, in January-February of this 
year R27 trillion[.sup]*[/] worth of consumer goods and 
services was sold to the Russian Federation population through 
all sales channels, which is eight times more than in 
January-February of last year in current prices, but 3 percent 
less in comparable prices. In February 1994 their physical 
volume was 6 percent less than last February. 
  Retail turnover, including public catering, at officially 
counted enterprises amounted to R12.5 trillion over two months 
of the current year, which comprises 52 percent of the total 
turnover (a sevenfold increase in current prices as compared to 
the corresponding period of last year, and a 5.7 percent decline 
in comparable prices). Its physical volume in February of this 
year was 6.2 percent below that of February 1993. 
  The share of the private sector (including consumer 
cooperatives) accounts for 56 percent of retail turnover (40 
percent in January-February 1993), the state sector--35 percent 
(58 percent), and other nonstate forms of ownership--9 percent 
(2 percent). 
  The coefficient of the retail trade network's saturation 
with 
consumer goods in February of this year remained unchanged as 
compared to January of this year (86 percent)[.sup]**[/], and 
increased by 23 percent[.sup]***[/] as compared to February 
of last year. Officially counted enterprises in January-February 
of this year sold to the population R6.8 trillion worth of 
foodstuffs, which is 7.6 times more in current prices than over 
the same period of last year and a 9.7-percent decrease in 
comparable prices. In February of this year the physical volume 
of retail turnover in foodstuffs declined as compared to last 
year's February by 10.6 percent. In January of this year 9-17 
percent less meat and poultry, canned meat, and vegetable oil 
was sold than last year, and 24-30 percent less canned fish, 
eggs, and sugar. 
  Slower sales of foodstuffs resulted in higher retail trade 
inventories. For instance, butter inventories increased from 19 
days of trading as of 1 January of this year to 23 days as of 1 
March; eggs--from seven to 10; sugar--from 53 to 61; 
confectionery items--from 21 to 27; and tea--from 58 to 62. 
  The coefficient of retail trade saturation with foodstuffs 
measured 82 percent in February of this year and increased as 
compared to February 1993 by 28 percent, including with respect 
to meat products, butter, vegetable oil, and bread products--by 
8-18 percent, sugar--by 21 percent, and milk products--by 35 
percent. 
  With the formation of the consumer market and the emergence 
of new sales channels, part of the population switched to buying 
foodstuffs at farmers markets. For instance, while the sale of 
basic foodstuffs at retail trade enterprises declined, sales of 
meat and milk products, vegetable oil, and potatoes at farmers 
markets increased by 17-35 percent, and of eggs--2.8-fold. 
  In January-February 1994 the population purchased (at 
officially counted enterprises) R5.7 trillion worth of nonfood 
consumer goods (a 6.7-fold increase in current prices and a 
1-percent decline in comparable prices). 
  In the environment of shrinking production, already existing 
elements of market relations are exerting a positive influence 
on the state of the market. While in the past domestic industry 
and state procurement were the only sources of goods coming in 
to the market, now a considerable share of nonfood goods inflow 
comes through various commercial and middleman structures, trade 
enterprises' independent purchases, and other channels. This 
contributes to consumer market saturation, and creates favorable 
conditions for alternative choices in purchases and meeting the 
demand of different groups of buyers. 
  Evidence of the process of market saturation with nonfood 
items is increased trade inventories of these goods. For 
instance, trade inventories of woolen fabrics increased from 40 
days of trade as of 1 February of last year to 64 days as of 1 
February of this year; silk fabrics--from 38 to 53 days; 
clothing and underwear--from 55 to 81 days; knitwear--from 47 to 
80 days; footwear--from 47 to 71 days; and radio receivers--from 
25 to 51 days. 
  In January-February of this year R2.6 trillion worth of 
for-fee services were rendered to the population through all 
channels of realization--an 11-fold increase in current prices 
and a 42-percent decline in comparable prices (in February of 
this year as compared to February 1993--42.3 percent). 
  Over two months the volume of for-fee services provided by 
officially counted enterprises amounted to R1.6 trillion (61 
percent of the total volume), which is 10 times more than last 
year in current prices and 48.5 percent less in comparable 
prices. 
<H5>  Foreign Economic Relations With Far Abroad Countries </H5>
  In January-February 1994, Russia's foreign trade turnover 
(without CIS countries) amounted to $8.1 billion and declined as 
compared to January-February 1993 in current prices by 7.2 
percent. Russia's exports amounted to $5.5 billion and increased 
by 1.2 percent; imports amounted to $2.6 billion and declined by 
21 percent. 
  In January-February of this year Russia had a $2.9-billion 
positive foreign trade balance ($2.1 billion positive trade 
balance in January-February 1993). 
<H5>  Monetary Income of the Population </H5>
  The monetary income earned by the population in 
January-February this year amounted to R32.4 trillion and 
increased as compared to the corresponding period of 1993 by 
9.2-fold. 
  In February this year the volume of monetary income of the 
population amounted to R18.3 trillion, which is 1.3 times more 
than in January of this year. This increase is mainly due to the 
difference in wages raised on 1 December 1993 and 1 January 1994 
for certain categories of the budget-financed sphere and 
administrative organs and paid out during this month, as well as 
an increase in the amount of compensation added to pensions. As 
a result, there was considerable monetary emission in February 
of this year--R1.6 trillion, while in January of this year 
R313.5 billion was taken out of circulation. 
  In the structure of expenditure of income, purchases of 
foreign currency and securities account for an increasingly 
greater share, with a simultaneous decline in the population's 
expenditures on goods and services.

  With respect to saving money in the bank, the population 
increasingly prefers commercial banks, which offer higher 
interest rates on deposits as compared to the State Savings 
Bank. For instance, in February this year the population 
deposited in commercial banks about R800 billion, and in the 
State Savings Bank--R444.7 billion; in February 1993--R15.5 and 
R89.3 billion, respectively. 
  In February this year as compared to the corresponding month 
in 1993, the population's disposable income (income less 
compulsory payments and contributions) increased 9.1-fold, while 
prices for goods and services increased approximately eightfold. 
The real disposable income of the population over this month was 
13 percent higher than a year ago (in January--7 percent). 
<H5>  City and Local Transportation Services for the Population </H5>
  The current difficulties and problems in the public 
transportation operations, which stem first and foremost from 
great wear and tear on the rolling stock, and the haphazard 
system of subsidies to public transportation enterprises are 
resulting in declining quality in passenger service, especially 
in cities; in particular, this is manifest in cutbacks in 
planned and actually performed route runs. 
  For instance, in Pskov 14 percent fewer runs were planned 
for 
February this year than February last year, and in reality 16 
percent fewer were performed; Makhachkala--22 percent and 12 
percent, respectively; Ivanovo--7 percent and 5 percent; 
Orenburg and Chelyabinsk--4 percent and 8 percent; 
Krasnoyarsk--7 percent and 19 percent; Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk--5 
percent and 14 percent; and Blagoveshchensk both with respect to 
the plan and in reality--10 percent. 
  During February of this year 1.7 million (11 percent) of 
planned trips by city ground passenger transportation were not 
made in republic capital cities and kray and oblast centers in 
the Russian Federation, and in some of them--between 14 percent 
and 33 percent. The figures for individual cities are presented 
below:

  As compared to last year, the greatest decline occurred in 
cargo deliveries by sea to the following ports: Dudinka (73 
percent), Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy (72 percent), Magadan (59 
percent), to the ports of Sakhalin (31 percent). 
  Less liquid cargo than of the same date last year was

  As of 1 March of this year 10,000 tonnes of products and 
goods were in the port of Vladivostok, which provides a gate to 
cargo deliveries to points in the North with year-round 
navigation, waiting to be shipped by coastal sea transport (54 
percent of that as of 1 March 1993), in the port of 
Vanino--22,000 tonnes (61 percent), and Vostochnyy--2,000 tonnes 
(13 percent). 
  As compared to 1 February of this year, cargo remaining to 
be 
shipped to the North on the whole increased at the main ports by 
5 percent; in the ports of Kandalakhsha, Vanino, and Arkhangelsk 
it increased, respectively, by 10 percent, 16 percent, and 35 
percent, and in the ports of Vladivostok, Murmansk, and 
Vostochnyy--it decreased by 2 percent, 16 percent, and 56 
percent.

<F P=106> [Interview with Tax Police Lieutenant General Yu.V. </F>
Chichelov, deputy director of the Department of the Tax Police 
of the Russian Federation, by Ivan Sas, under the rubric "Law"; 
place and date not given: "Do Not Take Too Much From the Bee. 
Can This Commandment of the Beekeeper Become a Commandment for 
the Tax Police?"] 
  [Text] The Russian tax police is now two years old. 
Our interlocutor, Tax Police Lieutenant General Yuriy 
Vasilyevich Chichelov, deputy director of the Department of the 
Tax Police (DNP) of the Russian Federation, was among those who 
initiated the creation of this new law enforcement 
structure. 
  [Sas] Yuriy Vasilyevich, what caused your service to be 
created? 
  [Chichelov] To understand the situation, let us mentally go 
back about two years and try to look at our reality through the 
eyes of the main enforcer of the law in the area of 
taxation--the tax inspector. These positions in state tax 
inspectorates were mainly held by women. 
  What did it mean for the tax inspector to go and check out a 
so-called "commercial" or private company? It was quite an 
ordeal. Tax legislation was violated every step of the way, and 
then not in trifling ways but to the tune of millions or even 
billions concealed from taxation. Two ways for circumventing the 
law became the most common. The first was to bribe the tax 
inspector. The second was to intimidate the inspector. There 
were a great many scenarios for carrying out either one. 
  It became obvious that the new system of taxation could not 
function effectively in the absence of a compact, well-equipped 
structure with the powers of a law enforcement organ that would 
be capable of putting an end to the rampage of crime in the 
sphere of tax legislation, offer protection to tax inspectors in 
the line of official duty, and prevent corruption in the tax 
organs. All of these tasks were entrusted to us. By now, we can 
say with complete confidence that the creation of the tax police 
was a farsighted and timely step. 
  [Sas] However, Yuriy Vasilyevich, the number of violations 
of 
law in the area of tax legislation is growing.... 
  [Chichelov] Unfortunately, this trend is gaining strength, 
which seriously concerns us. 
  Nonetheless, the current situation is fundamentally 
different 
from the one that existed two years ago. At that time we just 
had to state the facts and throw up our hands. At present, both 
the criminal business and just dishonest taxpayers are forced to 
reckon with the fact of the existence of the tax police. It has 
already made its presence known as a major force. 
  Look at the results of the operation of the federal organs 
of 
the tax police last year, for example. These organs, 
independently or jointly with the State Tax Service, uncovered 
and put an end to more than 32,000 violations of tax 
legislation. More than 600 criminal cases were initiated in 
conjunction with the concealment of income on both a large and 
particularly large scale. More than 1,000 enterprises and 
organizations were uncovered which were not even registered with 
the tax inspectorates, to say nothing about the payment of 
taxes. About 1 trillion rubles [R] was assessed for collection 
by the state budget, with the foreign exchange equivalent 
included, based on the results of independent audits and those 
carried out jointly with the State Tax Service. 
  As of now, the tax police has 88 territorial organs of the 
tax police with more than 11,000 employees; in keeping with a 
decree of the government, this number will come to about 40,000 
by the end of the year. 
  [Sas] Not a whole lot for a country like Russia. In some 
Siberian rayon-seat town they will perhaps learn about the 
existence of the tax police only from the newspapers. Meanwhile, 
the situation needs to be controlled there, too. 
  [Chichelov] You are right in that we indeed will not have an 
opportunity to establish our local organs in each rayon seat. 
However, this is not at all to say that no attention will be 
paid to the Russian backwaters. 
  Now that you have touched on Siberia, I will also explain 
this by using an actual example. In Kemerovo Oblast there is the 
city of Berezovskiy. The operation of the local tax inspectorate 
there was actually paralyzed by October of last year by several 
criminal groups that controlled local commercial structures. The 
employees of the inspectorate were literally terrorized by 
continual threats. Seeing that they were getting away with 
everything, the criminals began to act on their threats. Setting 
fire to the apartment of the chief of the Berezovskiy GNI [State 
Tax Inspectorate] became the high point of the activity of the 
local mafia clan. 
  For this reason, the DNP Directorate for Kemerovo Oblast, 
jointly with the Directorate for Combating Organized Crime of 
the Oblast Internal Affairs Administration, developed and 
executed an operation to normalize the situation in Berezovskiy 
with their own resources. The operations team also included the 
best trained employees of the State Automotive Inspectorate and 
GNI of the oblast. As a result, they succeeded in more than just 
straightening out the situation in the city. The operation that 
was carried out had a great preventive impact in other rayons of 
the oblast. 
  I am driving at a simple truth: Crime should be combated by 
skill rather than by numbers. We bet here on two things--the 
supreme professionalism of our employees and the closest 
possible cooperation with the State Tax Service and other law 
enforcement organs. 
  [Sas] Where do you get such professionals, given that, to my 
knowledge, nobody trains them in Russia to this day? 
  [Chichelov] Complaints have already been voiced in some 
quarters about the department supposedly "luring away" the best 
cadres from other ministries and departments. However, this is 
not happening, and it never has. At the very beginning, small 
quotas for specialists on temporary assignment from the 
organizations of the former Ministry of Security and Ministry of 
Internal Affairs totaling about 1,000 people were given to us on 
instructions from the government. The Ministry of Defense 
detached to us more than 3,000 people. We did not set any 
conditions for anyone; we just took the people who were given to 
us. Later, we professionally trained them ourselves. The 
leadership of the department was the first to sit at the 
training desk. Take a look--here is my certificate of graduation 
from a special course of the Instruction and Information Center 
of the State Tax Inspectorate of the city of Moscow. 
  [Sas] Yuriy Vasilyevich, I see that you even had to take a 
test in accounting.... 
  [Chichelov] The complexity of it is in the fact that the 
profession of tax policeman requires a combination of the most 
varied skills. As a rule, he should know finance, the credit 
system, and monetary circulation well in order to be head and 
shoulders above any accountant, if you will. On the other hand, 
he is a functionary of the law enforcement organs; he cannot do 
without substantial legal training. There are virtually no such 
ready-made professionals. This is why we have to train people. 
Naturally, former employees of "coercive" departments come here. 
We also hire experienced financiers and lawyers from among the 
civilian population. 
  Of course, this is not to say that our doors are open to 
all. 
It is equally important for us that these are people with a high 
safety margin as far as morality goes. 
  There have been new developments that are particularly 
pleasant for us: Not long ago it was resolved to open the Tax 
Police Institute using the facilities of the Finance Academy of 
the Russian Federation Government; classes will begin as early 
as this September. 
  We are also opening our own center for training and 
retraining newly hired employees with a college education. 
  [Sas] Yuriy Vasilyevich, the tax police needs incorruptible 
people. However, at present the popular view is that there are 
no such people, and the amount given is all that matters.... 
  [Chichelov] Such cynicism is characteristic only of those 
who 
recognize no values other than money and wealth. Luckily people 
are still around for whom the notions of duty, honor, and 
conscience are not the least important ones. There is no dearth 
of relevant examples. 
  Last year, only four criminal cases were instituted against 
the employees of the tax police for having taken bribes. 
Naturally, the continuation of service with us is out of the 
question for these individuals. 
  [Sas] What is your assessment of the current tax 
legislation? 
What is necessary in order to change the situation? 
  [Chichelov] An entire set of measures of an economic, legal, 
and organizational nature which would eliminate the very grounds 
for tax crimes and violations of law is necessary. 
  The main trouble with tax legislation is that thus far it 
does not give incentives to the manufacturers of merchandise and 
services, and renders their efforts unprofitable. It is no 
accident that this was noted in the message of the Russian 
Federation president to the Federal Assembly. I recall a story 
by Agranovskiy Senior in which an old beekeeper applied the 
wisdom of beekeeping at the level of state policy. The first 
commandment of the beekeeper and the architect of state alike 
should be: Do not take too much away from the bee. Take as much 
as will motivate the beehive to labor, and not the other way 
around. At a difficult time, he should incur expenses himself 
but should feed the bee family. If he gets greedy, he will be 
left not only without honey but also without bees. The basket of 
the beekeeper whose bees prosper is always full.

<F P=106> [Article by Oleg Rubnikovich: "`Hard-Currency' Pensioners </F>
Want To Get Their Money"] 
  [Text] Attempts by the Association of Former International 
Civilian Employees of the United Nations to obtain payment from 
the Russian Government of hard-currency assets awarded them from 
the United Nations Pension Fund have reached an impasse. 
  On 20 November 1958, the USSR Council of Ministers, "with 
the 
aim of eliminating excesses in the material support provided 
Soviet citizens working in the apparatuses of international 
organizations," began collecting from them two-thirds of their 
currency wages and all of their pension accruals on a compulsory 
basis. Instead of dollars, our fellow countrymen began receiving 
Soviet rubles. It is quite curious that pensioners could 
officially choose between receiving the allowance from the 
United Nations Pension Fund in currency or transferring their 
accumulated savings to the USSR Social Security Fund and 
receiving rubles. But in fact, as the victims themselves assert, 
they did not have any choice whatsoever and had to subordinate 
themselves to the dictate of the government under threat of 
sanctions. It should also be taken into account that whereas 
prior to the end of the 1980's, "international" pensioners were 
entirely able to exist on a 160-ruble individual pension of USSR 
value, and possibly did not grumble too much for that reason, 
today most of them receive not 100, 200, or even more dollars, 
but no more than 80,000 rubles. Their situation is truly 
problematic. 
  Thus, we have to say that for 30 and some odd years, our own 
state scraped together a decent amount of capital on hundreds, 
if not thousands, of "hard-currency" pensioners. According to 
the Russian Pension Fund, these funds did not go to the budget 
account of USSR State Social Insurance, allocated for pension 
security. For want of a currency account there, the funds simply 
went to the state budget. 
  The discriminatory decree remained in force until 1 January 
1991, when the USSR Council of Ministers decided to repeal it. 
Serving as the impetus for this, apparently, was a letter of 
Perez de Cuellar, Secretary General of the United Nations, 
addressed to countries that have confiscated funds from their 
citizens working within the United Nations system. The message 
emphasized that "this practice does not conform to the United 
Nations Charter, contradicts personnel regulations, and is 
damaging to basic principles of international civil service." 
Since January 1991, not one former Soviet--or today 
Russian--international civil servant retiring on pension has 
chosen a ruble pension over a hard-currency one. 
  However, extending at last to Russian employees of 
international organizations the opportunity to themselves 
dispose of their earned hard currency, the state "forgot" to 
restore the rights of those who "voluntarily" exchanged their 
currency pension for a ruble one over the course of the past 30 
years. 
  To the numerous applications by members of the Association 
to 
Russian and international authorities requesting reinstatement 
in the United Nations Pension Fund and the return of unlawfully 
confiscated money, the majority of such organizations responded 
with silence. 
  The scandalous story continued following the appeal of 
Vladislav Tikhomirov, former United Nations employee, to the 
Constitutional Court. On 1 July 1993, examining the case of Mr. 
Tikhomirov, the court also acknowledged the right of the 
Association of Former International Employees to stand up for 
the interests of their members. The court established that the 1 
December 1958 decree violated the UN Charter, the Universal 
Declaration on Human Rights, the Convention on UN Privileges and 
Immunities, and so on. Indeed, it was recommended that the 
government reinstate the plaintiffs in the UN Pension Fund. 
Following this, upon request of the Russian Federation Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs, the process was postponed two months. A 
representative of the ministry promised to resolve the problem 
on the governmental level over this time frame. However, the 
Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Social Security took up a 
rigid stance--there was no money. In the meantime, the Russian 
Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs admitted that pensions 
were confiscated from former Soviet employees of the UN in 
violation of the Charter of this worldwide organization and 
other international agreements concluded under its aegis. As a 
result, a double standard was put into effect: 158 former 
employees receive pensions from the UN Pension Fund, and 87 
individuals are denied this right. 
  Not too long ago, the Constitutional Court received a 
response from Mr. Chernomyrdin, prime minister of the Russian 
Federation Government, stating that the government intends to 
examine this issue. 
  In the meantime, the UN Pension Fund is attempting somehow 
to 
resolve this problem as it conducts negotiations with the 
Russian representation of the United Nations in New York. 
Without instructions from Moscow, however, the latter is not 
competent to decide this question, and the matter will most 
likely again come to a standstill. It should also be noted that 
the search for palliative measures on the national level will 
not resolve this problem and will not halt the stream of 
complaints to the United Nations and the courts. UN provisions 
with respect to securing pensions for its employees have been 
ratified by the General Assembly of this organization. These 
provisions are unique. They do not coincide, and indeed cannot 
coincide, with the national pension plans formulated in 
isolation and effective in 160 member states of the United 
Nations.

<F P=106> [Article by B. Pogorelov and V. Uvarov, senior special </F>
investigators under the general procurator of the Russian 
Federation, and I. Kuryanov, special investigator of Voronezh 
Oblast procuracy: "A Case of Special Importance: Investigators 
Appeal to Authorities and the Public"] 
  [Text] Over the past years we have been hearing constantly 
about crime overcoming the country, with corruption accounting 
for an increasingly greater share of it. This topic gets 
especially exaggerated and played up during the period of 
preparation for a referendum and in speeches of candidates for 
deputies on the threshold of another election. 
  Yes, crime has indeed overcome Russia: Gangsters are on the 
rampage; businessmen are the prey of choice; people are killed 
day and night, on the streets and in their apartments; bombs are 
placed in their work place and homes; huge numbers of 
bureaucrats reap dividends from simply doing what is supposed to 
be part of their job; increasingly often, the criminals' victims 
are children. 
  In 1993 the highest rate of solving all kinds of crime in 
Russia was 69.7 percent in Tambov Oblast, the lowest--34.1 
percent in the Republic of Karelia. In Moscow and Petersburg, 
respectively, the figures were 44.5 percent and 44.4 percent. 
All in all, 2,799,644 crimes were registered in 
Russia (not counting latent, unregistered crimes), of which only 
50.8 percent were solved, that is, one half. A more than 
depressing picture. 
  What, in our opinion, stands in the way of putting a 
successful barrier to the bacchanalia of crime? First and 
foremost, of course, political instability and the 
economic crisis. They create fertile soil for criminal 
activities. But there are also organizational shortcomings in 
crime-prevention work itself. Among them we should point out 
first and foremost the fact that investigative-operational units 
are scattered among different agencies and their actions are 
poorly coordinated. Tremendous damage to the cause is created by 
the lack of a new legislative base. And what is most depressing, 
there is no light at the end of the tunnel; moreover, on the 
wave of reformist agitation, "preferential" laws are being 
adopted in the interests of criminals. 
  There are also other factors contributing to runaway crime. 
Among them are lack of responsibility for failures in 
investigative work, which is often conducted poorly from a 
professional standpoint; the inequality of citizens before the 
law; and the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] being overloaded 
with other tasks that are unrelated to crime solving. 
  Especially regretful is the failure to use to the necessary 
extent the operational and technical potential of the former 
Ministry of Security [MB], which is being endlessly 
spontaneously reorganized, a fact the criminal world is 
skillfully using to its advantage. It is possible that the 
initiators of the final abolishment of the Ministry of Security 
were guided by good intentions. But what was the result of not 
seeing the absolutely obvious outcome? A highly skilled 
investigative apparat, which is so much needed today, has been 
destroyed. It is true that its cases under investigation--and 
there about 2,000 of them--were transferred to the procuracy, 
together with the suspects in detention. But who will 
investigate them there, especially within a compressed time 
frame? Especially taking into account their specificity? The 
investigators from the now former MB have not been transferred 
to the procuracy, so in reality the investigative corps has been 
reduced in total number. The result is that the only ones to 
gain from this presidential edict are the criminals, and not the 
small fry at that. 
  Not least important in this disintegration are political 
appointments to jobs in law enforcement. Let us look once again 
at the interagency commission for combating crime and 
corruption. While its creation could be perceived as the desire 
to have a highest-level coordinating body, the appointment of a 
politicking lawyer as its head at the very least raised the 
eyebrows of everyone more or less knowledgeable in these matters. 
  The results, as they say, were quick to show. Slandered, as 
the Moscow City Procuracy has established, Rutskoy had to be 
hastily exonerated in the eyes of the public opinion... 
  How do we see the body for combating crime (the name is not 
important--whether it is a department, ministry, committee, 
bureau, and so on)? It must include an investigative committee, 
comprising units along the following lines: criminal 
investigations, and a combined unit for combating economic and 
organized crime. Currently existing units most often duplicate 
one another's efforts. It should also include expert evaluation 
institutions (except medical), operational units, and 
investigative detention facilities. Naturally all of them should 
be removed from MVD jurisdiction. It should maintain business 
contacts and interaction with the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service, and conduct joint actions on matters within the 
latter's competence. 
  Gathered together, in one powerful fist, the aforementioned 
units--the head of the entire structure absolutely has to be a 
member of the Security Council--will be capable, in our opinion, 
of conducting investigations promptly and successfully, and in 
the final analysis, suppress crime. 
  We cannot leave unmentioned the role of investigator in such 
a body. In essence he is the main actor, and it is for him that 
the operational services should work within the framework of a 
specific criminal case, intensifying or reducing their 
activities depending on the results. He should receive in 
writing all their information without identifying the sources, 
which then remains outside the bounds of the case handed over to 
the court, which allows who did what and how to be checked. 
  Right now information relevant to numerous cases under 
investigation bypasses him, goes into the file of a militia 
operative, and after a period of time is destroyed. On top of 
that other militia officers, who are not part of the criminal 
case (and responsibility for it) have access to it, as well as 
technical personnel at the stage of registration and handling. 
That is, there is a myriad of opportunities for information 
leaks, and only the procuracy investigator, alas, has no access 
because it is classified. A criminal can take advantage of this 
information, but the investigator cannot. This situation allows 
criminals to avoid prosecution, and operational services--to 
hide their inactions and incompetency. There is also great 
potential here for abuse of official position. 
  The time has come to bring up the question of redefining the 
rights and duties of the investigator and the procurator, and 
their relationship. The current Criminal Process Code of Russia 
says that in the course of preliminary investigation the 
investigator makes independently all decisions on the direction 
and conduct of investigative action, with the exception of 
instances envisaged by the law when a procurator's sanction is 
needed (and now from the court as well), and also bears complete 
responsibility for their legal and timely conduct. 
  Complete independence? Do not be too hasty. Here are the 
rights of the procurator, which do not leave the investigator 
any room for independence. He, the procurator, initiates the 
case and requests an audit; revokes investigators' decisions; 
issues written instructions on investigating a crime, on 
selecting, changing, or repealing a measure to secure the 
appearance of the accused, on classifying a crime, and on 
conducting individual investigative actions, and all his 
instructions are mandatory for compliance; participates in 
conducting investigations, personally conducts certain 
investigative actions or full investigations; removes the 
investigator from further handling of the case; affirms the bill 
of indictment; and sends the case to the court... 
  In other words, it is the procurator who makes all 
the major decisions on the case, while the investigator is 
relegated to the role of executor of his will, which 
is far from always based on the law. 
  A serious miscalculation was made by the procuracy's 
previous 
leadership in the GKChP [State Committee on the State of 
Emergency] case. It was precisely this case that did a lot of 
damage to the procuracy's authority, and that of the 
investigators with it, although their fault in this is a lesser 
one. Considerable resources and high-level specialists were 
brought into the investigation of that case; they carried out 
their duties in keeping with the requirements of the law. 
However, the proof they collected was evaluated not by them but 
by Procurator General--now former--V. Stepankov, his deputy Ye. 
Lisov, and V. Frolov. 
  One of the authors of this article was in Foros and worked 
with the border troops personnel, who were blamed for everything 
under the sun during the first days after the rescue of the 
"Foros captive." Who, by the way, has never been found a victim 
in this case. The investigator's assessment, based on the 
testimony of the people who guarded the president's dacha, not 
only was not needed by anyone--the team's leadership did not 
even listen to his report on the work done. 
  As to the circumstances of developing the procurator's 
assessment, which then became the basis for the prosecution's 
case, there was a testimony of one of the organizers of the 
investigation--the same V. Frolov. In IZVESTIYA dated 11 January 
1994, in his "advice" to the procuracy he blames himself for at 
the time "...not having been able to find a precise 
classification for the case. But this was an unprecedented case, 
and the opinions of scholars and specialists were split exactly 
half-and-half...." That is interesting; somehow, we, during all 
our years of investigative work, believed that the 
facts that serve as evidence are established through 
the testimony of a witness, the victim, a suspect, the accused, 
and others, among whom the "opinions of scholars and 
specialists" or perhaps someone else are not envisaged by the 
law. 
  By the way, it is not surprising that Mr. Frolov was not 
able 
to "determine his position." Although he is called a "former 
investigator," and after his interrogation of Gorbachev even was 
listed for some time as the "prime" investigator, he never 
worked as one in his life. Hence Mr. Frolov's "advice" to 
produce a political rather than legal assessment of the actions 
of those using tanks to shell point-blank the parliament legally 
elected by the people, and those who issued this order. 
  We think that all jurists, including the "resigned" General 
Procurator of the Russian Federation, A. Kazannik, who recently 
wrote an anniversary article about A.F. Koni, remember how the 
latter made precisely a legal assessment of the 
criminal case against V. Zasulich, for which he ended up for 
many years in disfavor with the authorities but went down in 
history as a great jurist. There are people in Russia to emulate! 
  The State Duma amnestied the participants of the October 
events. However, the lessons of the investigative actions in 
this case must be learned. 
  As is known, the Office of the General Procurator of Russia 
initiated criminal proceedings on the Moscow events on 3-4 
October 1993. Article 20 of the Criminal Process Law, which is 
mandatory for the procurator and the investigator, says that 
they, along with the court, must take all measures envisaged by 
the law in order to conduct a comprehensive, complete, and 
objective investigation of the circumstances of the case; the 
next article of the same law mandates that the causes and 
conditions that contributed to the commission of the crime must 
be identified. Based on these requirements, an investigator must 
examine the "site" of the incident, facilities, objects, and 
documents for the purpose of uncovering criminal evidence and 
determining the situation. 
  Now a trick question. Was it necessary to examine the 
Russian 
parliament? Without question, any jurist will say, and it had to 
be done right away on 4 October, immediately after the 
president's opponents left it. The investigators in the central 
apparat waited in vain for instructions to go and examine the 
site of the incident. The investigators spent the first half of 
5 October waiting. 
  Now let us turn to ex-General Procurator V. Stepankov, who 
recently broke his vow of silence and in an interview to the 
Perm newspaper ZVEZDA said the following. "On 3 October [as 
published] we found no corpses in the White House. Not a single 
one. Therefore, the investigation was deprived of the 
opportunity to establish to the full extent the cause of death 
of each person who had been taken away from this building before 
we arrived. What we saw differed a lot from the picture in which 
the White House is presented as a source of threat stuffed with 
numerous armaments." 
  Excuse me, Mr. Stepankov, but why did you not fulfill your 
duty and did not issue instructions to begin the examination as 
early as 4 October, or at least in the morning of 5 October, and 
did so only after all the casualties had been removed, thus 
immediately nullifying all the efforts of the investigators to 
establish the truth? 
  And generally, the question of "the eyes of the sovereign" 
deserves special attention. They are losing their vision 
increasingly often. Examples? Certainly... The general procuracy 
removes itself from initiating a criminal case based on the fact 
of V. Bakatin's handing state secrets over to the United States. 
The law is the law, and no matter how you twist it, the actions 
of the former chairman of the KGB did contain the attributes of 
the crime envisaged by Article 64 of the RSFSR Criminal 
Code--betrayal of the motherland. How many facts of pilfering 
the national wealth with the participation of highest officials 
have come to light, while criminal proceedings have not been 
initiated in a single one. 
  We have had five general procurators over the past few 
years. 
All of them were appointed for understandable reasons. M.S. 
Gorbachev had A.Ya. Sukharev; the situation changed 
somewhat--now it was N.S. Trubin; during the period of the 
"battle of sovereignties"--"our man" V.G. Stepankov. He did not 
meet expectations and was immediately replaced. A. Kazannik did 
not carry out the president's "political will" 
(again, let us note, not the law but someone's will), 
and he had no choice but to resign. 
  All the aforementioned procurators had something in common, 
however: They all attempted to subjugate the investigative 
apparat and use it in political battles. 
  There is no question that in matters of combating crime far 
from the last place belongs to the preliminary investigation, 
which should be concentrated in only one single organization. In 
order for it to function normally, norms of criminal and 
criminal process law must be urgently changed to take current 
realities into account. The procuracy's oversight over 
investigations must be abolished by transferring the right to 
issue sanctions to the court. 
  Perhaps it makes sense to have in the central apparat a few 
irremovable investigators for the investigation of cases of 
particular importance--for instance, those initiated on the 
materials of parliamentary commissions. The legal status of such 
an investigator will protect him from bureaucrats' arbitrariness 
and enable him to work in keeping with the letter of the law. 
  As to the procuracy, it should be retained, without the 
right 
to oversee investigations, and precisely as an eye--an 
all-seeing eye at that--that will promote compliance with the 
law and facilitate the building of a law-based state. It is a 
different matter to correctly organize its work, find qualified 
personnel, and place them skillfully, to serve the law and only 
the law, and to rid itself of inert, unprincipled staff members 
who "go with the flow" and orient themselves on "evenly split" 
opinions. 
  In this article we, professional procuracy officers, have 
presented our views on investigation and the shortcomings 
existing in combating crime, and it will be enough of a reward 
for us if at least some of what we have said will be used to 
root out problems.

"Foundation for Protection of Glasnost Protests Violations of 
Media Rights in Petersburg"] 
  [Text] Aleksey Simonov, chairman of the board of the 
Foundation for the Protection of Glasnost, sent a protest to 
Deputy Mayor Valeriy Malyshev regarding the violation of radio 
broadcasting companies' rights in Petersburg contained in the 
"Directives" sent by Malyshev to heads of rayon administrations 
and in the proposed contract between the GTRK [State Television 
and Radio Company] Petersburg--Channel 5 and rayon 
administrations. 
  A broadcaster called "Administration" is not envisaged in 
any 
law, and granting this subject--mythical from the standpoint of 
the "Law on the Mass Media"--the right to enter a contract with 
a GTRK is not only illegal but simply unnatural. There are rayon 
desks registered as mass media entities (dependent or 
independent of rayon administrations), and only they may be the 
subject of contracts involving broadcasting, says the protest. 
  In addition, Simonov draws Malyshev's attention to the fact 
that the GTRK Petersburg--Channel 5 itself does not have a 
license to conduct broadcasting over the wire, and therefore its 
claim to exclusivity in wire broadcasting is extremely 
questionable. 
  And finally, the unit that has been set up in the GTRK for 
the purpose of monitoring the content of radio programs 
broadcast by rayons is an act of local censorship, which in 
principle is contrary to the current law. 
  As to election materials and their broadcasting through 
rayon 
"desks," the executive branch does not have the prerogative to 
sanction or ban this, even less so the "mother" television and 
radio company. 
  "The fund is ready to support a court action by any of the 
rayon desks, whose legitimate rights are infringed on either by 
the `Directives' or the `Contract,' of which we hereby inform 
you simultaneously with this letter," Aleksey Simonov continued.

"Broadcasting": "Channel 5 Has Received the Right To Control 
City Radio Broadcasts"] 
  [Text] In her speech on one of the programs of St. 
Petersburg radio, the manager of RGTRK [Russian State Television 
and Radio Company] "Peterburg--5-y kanal" [Petersburg-Channel 
5], Bella Kurkova, called the accusations of financial 
violations against the management of the television and radio 
company an attempt at political opposition and announced her 
intention "to fight against them as is proper for a journalist." 
In her opinion, it is useful for the national-communist 
opposition to undermine the authority of the large television 
and radio company on the threshold of elections to the City 
Assembly in order to besmirch not just the reputation of the 
RGTRK Petersburg-Channel 5, but also the reputation of the 
political organizations close to the company's management. 
  According to some information, the deputy mayor of St. 
Petersburg, Valeriy Malyshev, sent an edict to all the city's 
rayon administrations to prevent any cases of uncontrolled 
pre-election broadcasts by rayon radio stations and to see that 
thereafter the content of pre-election broadcasts is coordinated 
with the management of the RGTRK Petersburg-Channel 5. In Mr. 
Malyshev's opinion, it is precisely the RGTRK which is the only 
rightful broadcaster in the entire city, and all the other 
broadcasters (even those registered as mass information media) 
which use the city radio broadcast network must ask its manager 
for permission to prepare their programs. 
  But it is possible that the scandals surrounding RGTRK 
Petersburg-Channel 5 are the result not so much of political as 
commercial grounds. According to some information, the RGTRK 
management is working up a variant for creating a joint stock 
company (with all buildings, structures, and equipment of the 
RGTRK transferred to it) with the participation of the American 
company TV and Radio St. Petersburg, which proposes to offer 49 
percent of the charter capital of the future joint stock 
company, and of another limited partnership whose founders are 
as yet unknown. The documents on the joint stock company's 
creation were passed through by Dmitriy Mezentsev, head of the 
mayor's office committee for press and mass information media, 
and arrived on the desk of the minister of the press, Vladimir 
Shumeyko. However, the television and radio company's financial 
activity is of increasing interest to law enforcement organs. 
The procurator's office demanded documents on its deals with the 
joint stock company "Kommercheskiy tsentr TV i radio 
Sankt-Peterburga" [Commercial TV and Radio Center of St. 
Petersburg] and the joint stock company "Nevskiy Glashatay" 
[Neva Herald].

"Unpleasantness": "The Financial Scandal Surrounding St. 
Petersburg Television Thickens: Bella Kurkova Demands She Be 
Recognized as a `Victim of Political Provocation'"] 
  [Text] The scandal surrounding the financial activity of 
the management of the television and radio company 
"Peterburg--5-y kanal" [Petersburg-Channel 5] has finally become 
just like a political mystery story now that its manager, Bella 
Kurkova, officially acknowledged the fact that her deputy for 
advertising activity, Mikhail Syroyezhin, had disappeared. Ms. 
Kurkova accused the missing man of organizing the mass 
provocation against her personally and against the democratic 
management of the television and radio company as a whole by 
setting up a sponsorship agreement between "Kommercheskiy tsentr 
TV i radio Peterburga" [Commercial TV and Radio Center of St. 
Petersburg] and the limited partnership "Nevskiy Glashatay" 
[Neva Herald], which her husband, Vadim Tareyev, heads. That 
agreement was the cause of the scandal. 
  According to information which is as yet unconfirmed, Mr. 
Syroyezhin is now in Austria, protecting himself from the 
focused interest of law enforcement organs. People in the 
company are also saying that the missing man called Ms. Kurkova 
and informed her that he is in one of the hospitals on Russian 
Federation territory where he is hiding from the "raids" of 
racketeers. It is possible, however, that both versions are far 
from reality, since contradictory rumors are flying through the 
halls of the RGTRK [Russian State Television and Radio Company] 
that Mr. Syroyezhin was seen in the United States, while others 
allege that he has "holed up" in Moscow. 
  However, it has become known that there exist directives 
signed by Mr. Syroyezhin transferring large amounts of the 
television and radio company's capital abroad--to the account of 
the company TV and Radio St. Petersburg, whose founder is once 
again Mr. Syroyezhin himself. Taking into account the fact that 
it was the "American" company TV and Radio St. Petersburg which, 
with the approval of the vice premier of the Russian government, 
Vladimir Shumeyko, was supposed to receive 49 percent of the 
charter capital in conjunction with the joint stock company 
RGTRK Petersburg-Channel 5 (the RGTRK with Mr. Shumeyko's 
approval was supposed to invest all its buildings, structures, 
and equipment in the joint stock company's charter capital); it 
is likely that the scandal will prove to be larger than was 
initially supposed. 
  It is interesting that Mr. Syroyezhin at one time was 
appointed deputy chairman of the RGTRK by that same Ms. Kurkova. 
Now even she and her husband are trying to have nothing to do 
with the energetic Mr. Syroyezhin. In a statement on one of the 
broadcasts of St. Petersburg radio, Mr. Tareyev explained that 
he took R12 million as sponsorship aid from the joint stock 
company Commercial TV and Radio Center of St. Petersburg 
(although he suspected its indirect budget origin) and 
surrendered to the persuasion of Mr. Syroyezhin whom he trusted 
because he knew his father, a scientist well known in Petersburg. 
  Ms. Kurkova in turn explained that she knew nothing at all 
about her husband's firm receiving major financial aid from the 
partners of the state television and radio company which she 
manages. 
  Now the management of the RGTRK Petersburg-Channel 5 is 
trying to impart a purely political look to the scandal 
surrounding the RGTRK's financial activity. In a broadcast on 
St. Petersburg radio, which is subordinate to Ms. Kurkova, she 
was called a "fearless journalist whom her enemies, most of whom 
she acquired during the years of perestroyka, want to settle 
accounts with." Taking into account that the political 
opposition had a hand in the appearance of the packet of 
documents on the activity of the management of the RGTRK 
Petersburg-Channel 5 at the procurator's office, Bella Kurkova 
announced that the ultimate goal of the organizers of the 
scandal is to "remove first Kurkova, and then Sobchak, and then 
even Yeltsin from office." 
  A special presidential commission which came to St. 
Petersburg to verify the accusations against Ms. Kurkova is more 
and more inclined to the conclusion that if the RGTRK management 
did in fact do some strange things, it was not out of malice; 
the head of the commission, Andrey Semikolennyy, announced in an 
interview on St. Petersburg radio: "Kurkova has become a victim 
of major political provocation." It is altogether possible that 
even the city procurator's office will be satisfied with the 
explanations of the "difficult circumstances" in which the 
management of the television and radio company found itself and 
will terminate the investigation.

<F P=106> [Interview with Anatoliy Nazeykin, chairman of the Central </F>
Committee of the Trade Union of Communication Workers, by Ivan 
Akkuratov, correspondent of OBSHCHAYA GAZETA: "Strike on the

  [Text] After the warning action by communication 
workers, when television screens went out in many regions of 
Russia, the government promised to look into their problems and 
to rectify the situation in the very near future. Therefore, all 
the more unexpected is the call for an all-Russian strike by 
RTPTs [not further identified] workers. A correspondent of 
OBSHCHAYA GAZETA contacted by telephone Anatoliy Nazeykin, 
chairman of the Central Committee of the Trade Union of 
Communication Workers. 
  [Nazeykin] After the February events, when communication 
workers banged, as they say, their fists on the table, we 
managed to handle only last year's debts. Communication workers 
have already received about 30 billion. The government promised 
to cover the remaining 35.9 billion in the very near future. Up 
to now it is unclear what will be this year. Contracts with many 
television and radio companies have not been concluded and there 
is no financing. It is not even clear how many state television 
programs and what their broadcasting volumes will be. 
  [Akkuratov] Could a meeting with the prime minister solve 
the 
problems? 
  [Nazeykin] We have not yet seen Chernomyrdin. Proposals for 
the government draft decree on television and radio broadcasting 
had to be prepared first. The document must determine how it 
will develop and who will manage it. The draft (it already 
exists!) discusses the establishment of the Teleradioinform 
Company under the Ministry of Communications. In the future 
television and radio companies will have to conclude contracts 
for technical servicing with it. Taking into consideration the 
big delays in the payment for our services, we proposed that a 
point on prepayment be introduced into the decree. 
  [Akkuratov] However, the February action, seemingly, has 
brought results. Why are passions inflamed again? 
  [Nazeykin] Because in a number of regions--Kirov, Kemerovo, 
Tula, and Voronezh--they began to set procuracies against 
communication workers. Although in February a strike was not 
even discussed--a reduction in broadcasting volumes, yes. 
Incidentally, in oblasts, where heads of administrations 
allocated money from their budget, broadcasting was not reduced. 
Now RTPTs labor collectives demand that the prosecution of their 
leaders be stopped, but their opinion is ignored. 
Dissatisfaction is growing and people are declaring their 
intention to use extreme measures. 
  [Akkuratov] Political demands, as in February, are not put 
forward? 
  [Nazeykin] When in March people receive wages for November 
and December--is this policy or not? The state has four 
television channels, let it pay for them. If it is unable to do 
so, let it give them to commercial structures. Communication 
workers are dissatisfied with the fact that television and radio 
companies do not settle their accounts with them for 
advertising, which takes more and more time on the air. 
  [Akkuratov] Are you not disturbed by the fact that, by 
"punishing" the state, you infringe primarily upon television 
viewers' rights? 
  [Nazeykin] What is left? During the entire year of 1993 we 
talked about our unfortunate situation. No reaction. Then we 
decided to resort to a reduction in broadcasting. At first we 
scheduled this for 1 July and then we postponed this to 12 
August. To 1 October. And, again, nothing but promises. The 
broadcasting center in Kamchatka was idle for an entire month. 
Power engineering workers shut it off owing to our debts. Most 
technical centers have been operating to the point of wear for a 
long time. Basic equipment has become disabled. There are no 
funds to buy new equipment. What is there to wait for? 
  [Akkuratov] Nevertheless, how realistic is an all-Russian 
strike by communication workers? 
  [Nazeykin] If the attempts to prosecute the organizers of 
the 
February action do not stop, it will be difficult to guarantee 
anything. Labor collectives can no longer be held back by 
promises to analyze the situation. If RTPTs leaders are not 
protected, the process will become uncontrollable. And then the 
consequences are unpredictable.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Klimov article under the rubric "Only in </F>
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA": "`Greetings' From the Other Side, or Whose 
Interests Does the Federal Government Communications and 
Information Agency Protect"] 
  [Text] Recently the press has carried a series of articles 
criticizing the activity of the Federal Government 
Communications and Information Agency under the Russian 
Federation president. Particular zeal in this respect has been 
shown by a Mrs. Selivanova, whose byline appears on a number of 
articles in SEGODNYA and KOMMERSANT-DAILY. Such close attention 
on the part of the press, or to be more accurate on the part of 
a single writer, to a structure that cannot be found even in 
government handbooks prompts a legitimate question: Why is this? 
  First of all I want to say thank you to Mrs. Selivanova. 
Were it not for her articles I, first, would still find it 
difficult to decipher the abbreviation FGCIA (Federal Government 
Communications and Information Agency) and, second, would not 
know that the FGCIA is a powerful pillar of the state and that 
there are termites trying to undermine that pillar. Why do I 
reach these conclusions? Because, now that I have familiarized 
myself with the substance of the question, I have arrived at the 
opinion that Selivanova's articles "Yeltsin in Gorki-1994" and 
"Sparkling Days of Kremlin Administrators" (SEGODNYA) and "Mind 
What You Say: Walls Have Ears" [Slovo ne vorobey: poymayut -- 
vyletish] (KOMMERSANT-DAILY) contain so many fantasies and 
distortions that you get the firm impression that the author is 
interested in achieving certain aims that are not expressed in 
the articles. 
  But before citing examples, let us say a little about the 
FGCIA and about what the Federal Agency does for the state. 
Only someone who is utterly uninformed can argue that the FGCIA 
has a monopoly in the sphere of providing information support to 
state structures (and Mrs. Selivanova speaks precisely of 
monopolism). In fact the FGCIA is part of a system of 
information support for organs of state power which also 
includes the independent channels of the Foreign Ministry, 
Defense Ministry, Ministry of Internal Affairs, State Committee 
for Statistics, Federal Counterintelligence Service, Foreign 
Intelligence Service, and others. But it is precisely the FGCIA 
that brings together the best scientific minds in the field of 
cryptography, specialists capable of closing any channels for 
the leakage of information of state importance. 
  Recent events in the life of the intelligence services again 
prove that foreign states' special services have by no means 
slackened their work. They have perhaps just slightly 
reoriented it toward the economy. They are now stepping up 
their efforts to intercept and analyze large amounts of 
non-secret information, obtaining as a result valuable data 
about Russia's life and activity. U.S. National Security Agency 
intelligence satellites constantly orbit over our country's 
territory, vacuuming up information from unprotected 
communication lines and relaying it to powerful processing and 
analysis centers. 
  Who can shield and safeguard information of state importance 
from any forms of intelligence, including satellite 
intelligence? The answer is clear -- only the FGCIA, with its 
powerful scientific and technical potential and many years of 
experience. 
  Nor is there any doubt that the development of information 
and telecommunication systems has always been ensured by a 
proper level of protection of those systems. This has always 
been the case in all countries. 
  I will not be able to briefly list all the conclusions of 
the 
SEGODNYA and KOMMERSANT-DAILY author regarding the FGCIA -- 
anyhow there is no point in doing so. I will dwell on the main 
ones. The elimination of the Information Resources 
Administration (IRA) within the structure of the President's 
Administration and its transfer to the FGCIA structure as a main 
administration is declared to be virtually a disaster. 
  If you proceed from the essence of the matter, this merger 
was aimed at implementing a unified technical policy, removing 
the duplication that existed, enhancing the reliability and 
security of information and telecommunication systems in 
Russia's organs of state power at the center and at local level, 
and also precluding the unjustified and ineffective use of 
budget funds intended for the creation of new communications and 
computer systems without regard for the existing information and 
telecommunications resources in our country. Translating this 
semiofficial language into something more intelligible, let us 
ask: What is the point in funding several communications 
systems from the state budget and why should a single consumer 
receive the same information from two sources? But that is 
precisely what happened when the IRA existed. Now this kind of 
duplication and overspending is ruled out by the president's 
edict. 
  But this is where we found Mrs. Selivanova's first 
"greetings" from the other side. I call it that because I can 
only conjecture about whose interests she is attempting to 
uphold. And she does this so clumsily that you can only marvel. 
Thus in February she reported that the president had not signed 
the edict about the merger of the FGCIA and the IRA because he 
had been warned by the newspapers. That is all the president 
has to do -- read papers containing articles about the IRA. 
Incidentally, even the "newspaper outcry" existed only in Mrs. 
Selivanova's articles. 
  Perhaps she is defending the interests of former IRA leader 
V. Kupriyanovskiy. Defending them zealously, even stooping to 
slander. One of the articles says that 400 IRA staffers have 
been accused of political unreliability. This is sheer fantasy. 
Practically all IRA specialists are continuing to work in their 
former jobs in implementation of the president's edict "On 
Improving Activity in the Sphere of the Computerization of 
Organs of State Power of the Russian Federation." 
  Why is Mrs. Selivanova fighting so hard for the former IRA 
leader? I don't think it's because of personal sympathies. But 
nor do I want to claim that valuable information came into the 
hands of the publications featuring Selivanova and their masters 
from the former IRA leader. As yet there is not all the 
necessary information on this score. I do not want to break the 
law. 
  But V. Selivanova does this with little thought for the 
consequences. In all her articles, and especially in 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY for 12 March, she directly accuses the FGCIA of 
illegal, anticonstitutional activities in eavesdropping on the 
telephone and office conversations of top officials and 
compiling so-called "telephone files" on this basis. 
  As is well known, the procedure for carrying out 
investigative operations, including eavesdropping on telephone 
and other conversations, is defined by the law "On Investigative 
Operation Activities in the Russian Federation." This indicates 
the range of organs entitled to carry out this activity. The 
FGCIA is not among them, and, in my view, the agency has proper 
grounds for demonstrating in court that tittle-tattle in a 
newspaper is very different from tittle-tattle in a kitchen or 
on the doorstep. I think that the persons in the president's 
immediate entourage whom the author of the articles is trying at 
all costs to set at loggerheads will also not remain indifferent 
to tittle-tattle in the press. 
  Nevertheless, if you read Mrs. Selivanova's revelations 
closely with pencil in hand, you get the impression that the 
author's "greetings" could even come from the other side of 
Russia's state border. After all, the attack is precisely on 
the line of increasing the information security of organs of 
state power. Whether deliberately or not, Mrs. Selivanova's 
articles serve the interests of foreign special services, which 
even now, during a worldwide thaw, openly state that they obtain 
a considerable proportion of their information about Russia's 
life and activity from technical means of information transfer. 
  Or maybe the "greetings" come from Russian mafia structures? 
After all, because of the flaws in bank systems they have been 
able to steal hundreds of billions of rubles from the state, in 
other words, from you and me. Remember the numerous cases of 
bogus advice notes. It was the FGCIA which blocked this channel 
for the loss of state funds. A standard for digital electronic 
signatures has been developed in conjunction with the Central 
Bank. This technical solution makes it possible to establish 
the addressee and the authenticity of a financial document. 
Forgery is now impossible. The FGCIA ciphers are good for 
decades, that is, it will take that long for anyone to be able 
to find the keys to the ciphers. 
  All this confirms yet again the timeliness of the 
president's 
edict "On Improving Activity in the Sphere of the 
Computerization of Organs of State Power of the Russian 
Federation." And all this yet again refutes Mrs. Selivanova's 
newspaper articles. 
  I also have to say a few words about the lies in her 
articles. I'm sorry, but it's true. FGCIA leader Aleksandr 
Starovoytov -- doctor of technical sciences, professor, and 
honored scientific and technical figure of the Russian 
Federation -- came to the Government Communications Agency at a 
time when government communications required radical renewal and 
modernization. As a leader of a science and production 
association, he came as a recognized and experienced specialist 
in the telecommunications sphere. That was essentially how his 
active service began. 
  And what about the claim about magnetic fields surrounding 
the government White House? This gibberish is apparently 
designed for people who did not complete their elementary 
education. It is also totally untrue that the FGCIA engages in 
business by signing commercial contracts with foundations of 
dubious origin to supply them with "open-source information" 
from government structures. 
  And the style of Mrs. Selivanova's articles: "...after two 
years of painstaking work to overcome the undesirable 
consequences of 1991 the `underground Sverdlovsk Oblast 
Committee' in the Kremlin in close alliance with the 
`underground Gazprom' in the White House and other similar 
structures is finally restoring both information-political and 
organizational control over Russia's top state leadership." 
Take newspapers from 1936 or 1937 -- the spirit of their 
articles is just the same. 
  I am not going to ape Mrs. Selivanova in this regard and 
describe enthusiastically what happens to people who undermine a 
pillar of the state. In a democratic state everything is 
decided by conscience and the courts. 
  But in the very near future we will describe the varied, 
useful, and very interesting activities of various structures of 
the Federal Government Communications and Information Agency.

<F P=106> [Report from Gazprom Information-Advertising Center: </F>
"Gazprom Knows the Sense in Missiles"] 
  [Text] A delegation from the Russian Joint Stock Company 
[RAO] Gazprom headed by chairman of the board R. Vyakhirev 
visited the Perm design and production joint stock companies 
Aviyadvigatel and Permskiye Motory, the Iskra 
scientific-production association and one of the city's 
machinebuilding enterprises. Until recently these converted 
enterprises worked on orders from the defense and aviation 
industries, producing engines for military and civilian 
designation as well as missile equipment. 
  Last year RAO Gazprom and the Perm enterprises concluded a 
three-year agreement on the development and experimental 
production, on the basis of aviation engines, of gas pumping 
units with a 12MVt capacity and a coefficient of useful service 
life of more than 34 percent. 
  Beginning in the 70s the gas industry used aviation engines 
as drive pumps at gas compressor stations of the main gas 
pipelines. However, at that time Gazprom used old equipment 
which had already exhausted its flight resources and which had 
low technical-economic indicators. During its visit to Perm the 
Gazprom delegation reviewed the experimental gas pumping unit 
models working at one of the gas pumping statons under Perm and 
discussed the course of further work on developing and 
implementing production of these units with the leadership of 
the Perm enterprises and design bureaus. 
  Production of this equipment ordered by Gazprom at Perm 
enterprises will allow for carrying out reconstruction at the 
currently existing compressor stations. As a result, the 
productivity of the mainline gas pipelines will increase 15-20 
percent, waste of gas will drop and expenses for repair work 
will decrease. 
  In addition, the orders from RAO Gazprom will allow the Perm 
enterprises to maintain their scientific and technical 
potential. Purchases of imported equipment will decrease as a 
whole for each sector.

<F P=106> [Interview with Leonid Gurevich, deputy chairman of the </F>
Russian Federation Committee on Precious Metals and Precious 
Stones (Roskomdragmet), by DELOVOY MIR correspondent Sergey 
Nikishov: "Russia May Become the Fifth Diamond Center"; date and 
place not given] 
  [Text] Three years ago, when the reorganization of 
Russia's diamond complex was being contemplated, Leonid 
Gurevich, as co-chairman of the parliamentary commission on this 
matter, was concerned, first of all, about how to preserve the 
industry. Now, from the standpoint of the deputy chairman of the 
Russian Federation Committee on Precious Metals and Precious 
Stones (Roskomdragmet), he considers it possible to turn Russia 
into one of the world's diamond centers. The prerequisites for 
this exist, although there are also quite a few difficulties, he 
declared in an interview with DELOVOY MIR correspondent Sergey 
Nikishov. 
<H5>  It Is Better Not To Fight </H5>
  [Nikishov] Recently, there has been a lot of talk in Russia 
about diamonds, which has seriously begun to affect the 
economics of this business. It happens that high-ranking state 
officials, without thinking about the consequences, are making 
statements which are causing appreciable losses. For example, 
statements about the fact that, in the near future, diamonds 
will be sold, so that funds will be available for paying wages. 
This is not done in commerce. 
  Yet, since approximately December of last year, a campaign 
has been unleashed in the world press, including in the special 
diamond publications, to discredit Russia as a partner in 
international affairs. It is being accused of violating 
international agreements, in particular, with the De Beers 
company. This matter has reached far beyond the bounds of the 
diamond theme and is inflicting harm on the country's investment 
policy. I perceive in this the longing of those who have 
monopolized the markets for diamonds, weapons, oil and so on, to 
drive us out from among the competitors. 
  [Gurevich] I was recently in the RSA [Republic of South 
Africa] and I saw for myself that the De Beers company is a real 
empire and a very serious organization. Of course, it is better 
"not to fight" with it. Although, it can be said, we are in an 
equal position with it. And De Beers should not "fight" with 
Russia either. From my point of view, both partners understand 
this. 
  [Nikishov] At one time, as far as I know, you believed that 
the De Beers company was not dealing with us completely 
honestly. Has your point of view changed? 
  [Gurevich] There are no grounds for maintaining that we are 
being deceived in trading with De Beers. But we cannot assert 
that we are trading without losses for Russia. Unfortunately, we 
have no objective criteria for investigating this. 
  [Nikishov] But it is possible to control the prices for the 
Russian raw materials sold to the De Beers company with the help 
of the 5-percent cuts. According to the 1990 5-year, 95 percent 
of the Russian raw diamonds is supposed to be sold through De 
Beers' Central Sales Organization (TsSO), while we can sell the 
remaining 5 percent ourselves. 
  [Gurevich] Yes, we regard the 5-percent cuts as controls. 
Last year, we finally established certain things. We sold 
industrial diamonds, which are not covered under the limitations 
of the agreement with our South African partner. This batch was 
first offered to De Beers, but the company declined them. And we 
sold them to other partners at a much higher price than we could 
have sold them based on De Beers' price list. 
  The accusations made against us that a parallel diamond 
market is being thereby created are completely unfounded, 
inasmuch as the industrial diamonds, in terms of value, amount 
to a small portion of the overall sales of gem diamonds. 
Nevertheless, we have obtained access to the price-setting 
mechanism and have verified in practice to what extent the 
price-list price of our diamonds corresponds to the actual 
market price. And now we can extrapolate the results of the 
experiment with industrial raw materials to possible results 
with gemstone raw materials. 
  But we see the greatest problems as being not abroad, but 
rather, in our country. It is necessary to overcome the 
opposition of those who would not like to change the situation 
in the diamond industry, which took shape over decades, and to 
lose the opportunity to participate in the distribution. The 
Russian Federation Committee on Precious Metals and Precious 
Stones, the central organ for the regulation (but not the 
management) of relations in this sector, was given these 
functions in May of last year. Only after this did the 
possibility emerge of opposing the lobbying groups which are 
"wooing" the government and the president. 
<H5>  For the Good of All </H5>
  [Nikishov] It has already been reported in the press that, 
at 
the present time, the government is examining an entire set of 
questions associated with diamond matters. Along what lines is 
the work proceeding and is it possible to talk about preliminary 
results? 
  [Gurevich] I can say that, for quite some time now, the 
government has been studying a broader question than the one 
which is being frequently raised in the press. This is the 
question of Russia's overall diamond strategy and policy in this 
area for the foreseeable future. And, as strange as it may 
sound, the problem of relations with the De Beers company, in my 
opinion, is not the main one here. Trade with De Beers is an 
obligatory measure and nothing more. 
  We have currently approached the examination of the diamond 
industry from a completely different perspective, based on the 
conviction that Russia may well become the world's fifth diamond 
center. The entire diamond world maintains that Russia should 
become one of these centers. Four currently exist -- New York, 
Antwerp, Tel-Aviv and Bombay. All of them are large centers for 
the buying and selling of raw diamonds and their processing. For 
example, in Antwerp, the annual diamond turnover amounts to $15 
billion (importing and exporting is approximately 
half-and-half). And this is in the absence of actual mining. 
And, last year, through the Central Sales Organization in 
London, the Almazy Rossii-Sakha [Russia-Sakhalin Diamond] 
Company sold nearly $1.2 billion worth of Russian diamonds. 
  [Nikishov] But developed consumer articles markets have long 
been established there. And this took years. 
  [Gurevich] But who is currently hindering us from seriously 
getting into this business? Whereas, previously, we set the task 
of just processing diamonds and selling cut diamonds, we now 
believe that it is necessary to build lapidary plants with the 
idea of inviting partners who have their own niche in the 
foreign market. Those who will place orders for enterprises and 
introduce jewelry of contemporary design. There are a great 
number of people who wish to operate in Russia now. 
  But, all the same, cut diamonds are just a semifinished 
product. But if this task is viewed on a broader scale? Let us 
go farther and also develop jewelry production together with 
gem-cutting. But let us go to the performance of this task from 
the market. 
  [Nikishov] Obviously, you have in mind the differentiation 
of 
incomes occurring in our country and, as a consequence, the 
increase in the class of people who are capable of buying 
expensive ornaments. 
  [Gurevich] I am certain that the capacity of the market for 
jewelry in Russia is sufficient for building serious social 
programs. Given a correct formulation of the matter, we can 
obtain serious revenues for the budget through the sale of 
jewelry. 
  [Nikishov] Is it possible to call this the second stage of 
the concept developed with your participation for the 
reorganization of the rough-and cut-diamond complex? 
  [Gurevich] It is possible. In the first stage, we set the 
task of preserving what we already have, in particular, the 
lapidary industry. And we have managed to do this. Last year, we 
reached newer frontiers in the use of the raw material 
(approximately $100 million worth more of cut-diamonds were sold 
than in 1990). 
  New enterprises and joint ventures have appeared in our 
country. But also important are the qualitative changes. We have 
begun to cut raw material which was traditionally not cut in 
Russia but, for which, a large currency efficiency is being 
attained. These qualitative features also, without fail, entail 
quantitative changes with respect to an increase in sales of 
already finished cut diamonds. 
  In addition, the creation of new jobs in the sector will 
also 
contribute to the solving of social problems. Unfortunately, we 
do not currently have enough gem cutters. Approximately 12,000 
people are employed in the sector, while there are about a 
million gem cutters in India. This industry has a low 
capital-output ratio and is rapidly beginning to produce a 
profit. 
  There is a possibility of establishing lapidary enterprises 
even in the VPK [military-industrial complex], where today, in 
view of the lack of orders, skilled personnel are standing 
around idle. The idea consists of employing the released sites 
and specialists. However, we will be trading with De Beers even 
after 1995. 
  [Nikishov] Can we consider the rough- and cut-diamond 
complex 
to now be on the threshold of substantial changes of both an 
internal sectorial nature and an external economic nature? 
  [Gurevich] We are not on the threshold of changes, but 
rather, we are in motion. In this connection, it is necessary to 
remember that work on the Arkhangelsk diamond field has started. 
At the beginning of this year, a license was finally issued to 
AO Severoalmaz [Northern Diamond Joint-Stock Company] for its 
pilot commercial development. 
  According to the predictions, this field should have a 
substantial impact on the future diamond market, because, based 
on their qualitative characteristics, the Arkhangelsk diamonds 
are better than the Yakut ones. The percentage of gem-quality 
diamonds and the amount of precious stones in the dirt are 
higher. 
  We are considering the possibilities for the broader use of 
scientific potential. Now, a large number of institutes are 
engaged in studying natural diamonds with specific properties. 
For example, there is a group of diamonds with a low nitrogen 
content. Some scientists believe that they will have a large 
future in the development of a new generation of computers. Such 
stones have a very high thermal conductivity, which 
substantially changes the processors' parameters. This is much 
more serious than gem diamonds. And Russia has almost a monopoly 
on their supplies. 
  The Americans and the Japanese are working in this field and 
collaboration with them is possible. 
<H5>  The Idea Should Seize the Masses </H5>
  [Gurevich] In order to coordinate all work associated with 
diamonds, we want to establish a Federal Diamond Center (FATs). 
  [Nikishov] This is what was being talked about back 2 years 
ago in connection with the development of the concept of the 
rough- and cut-diamond complex? 
  [Gurevich] Yes, the idea of establishing the center arose in 
connection with the need to control the sales of diamonds to the 
De Beers company. And it has now come back to us. What is needed 
is a large umbrella over everyone involved with diamonds. The 
Russian Federation Committee on Precious Metals and Precious 
Stones has submitted the appropriate proposals to the 
government. It is being proposed that the Federal Diamond Center 
be given the functions of coordinating all work, forming the 
corresponding information field and developing policy 
recommendations in this area. 
  [Nikishov] And how are your relations with the State Duma on 
this matter shaping up? Will the appropriate legal basis be 
prepared? 
  [Gurevich] I have already been in the Duma and tried to draw 
attention to this matter. We need to adopt a law on precious 
metals and precious stones. I believe that a draft of such a law 
will soon be submitted for the State Duma's consideration. And 
we will be happy if we find people there, who are also "taken" 
with diamonds. This is truly a fine, patriotic idea.

<H5>  De Beers' Revenues Are Growing </H5>
  The world monopolist in the trading of rough diamonds, the 
De 
Beers company, recently reported an increase in its revenues in 
the past year by 21 percent. The profits of the company, which 
combines the South African De Beers Consolidated Mines, Ltd., 
and the Swedish De Beers Centenary AG, amounted in 1993 to $595 
million ($491 million in 1992), which made it possible to 
increase the per-share dividend from 79.1 cents to 84.4 cents. 
  Named among the reasons for such a sharp rise in revenues 
are 
the record sales of rough diamonds and the renewed increase in 
sales in the diamond ornaments markets. As stated by De Beers 
Board Chairman Julian Ogilvy-Thompson, whose words are cited by 
the Reuters Agency, an increase in retail sales of jewelry 
ornaments with cut diamonds was noted first over the past 3 
years. He expressed the hope that the noticed trend would 
continue, provided the predictions for the growth of the world 
economy as a whole are proven correct. 
  Last year, $4.37 billion worth of precious stones, which is 
28 percent more than in 1992, were sold through De Beers' 
Central Sales Organization (TsSO) in London, which controls 
around 80 percent of the world sales of rough diamonds. 
  According to data from the Central Sales Organization's 
management, originally, the increase in the demand for jewelry 
ornaments with cut diamonds (by 7-9 percent on the whole) was 
noted in the United States, which is the largest sales market 
for these goods. But subsequently, an even greater increase in 
demand (by 15-16 percent on the whole) occurred in the countries 
of Southeast Asia. At the same time, a drop in sales volumes was 
noted in Europe. 
  Specialists are predicting an increase in the demand for 
jewelry ornaments with cut diamonds in Japan, South Korea, 
Thailand and Taiwan.

Article Type:CSO 

<F P=106> [Article, under the rubric "Returning to What Has Been </F>
Printed": "Don't Be Surprised if Chernobyl Repeats Itself"] 
  [Text] In connection with an appeal made by workers 
from the "Novovoronezhatomenergoremont" production repair 
enterprise [PRP] to the president and government of the Russian 
Federation [RF] (see RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA, 22 February 1994), the 
"Rosenergoatom" concern, at the instruction of the Russian 
Minatom [Ministry of Atomic Energy], has informed our editors of 
the following: 
  Minatom and the "Rosenergoatom" concern are 
seriously concerned about the situation that has come about in 
the country's nuclear power complex. 
  As of 23 February 1994, the indebtedness to Russia's 
nuclear power stations for electrical energy supplied by the 
"YeES Rossiya" RAO (Russian joint-stock company) and the 
territorial energy systems totaled 409,812 million rubles [R]. 
  This has led to the indebtedness of the nuclear power 
stations to their suppliers of fuel and material resources, to 
contractors, and to the budget of R341,183 million and has also 
led to rebuilding, modernizing, and technical re-equipping work 
on nuclear power stations being scaled back, which has had a 
negative effect on ensuring their safety. 
  There are delays of many months in the payment of 
wages, and programs for the socioeconomic development of 
collectives are not being implemented. 
  Taking into account the complex financial situation of 
the "Novovoronezhatomenergoremont" PRP, the "Rosenergoatom" 
concern has been systematically rendering the enterprise 
assistance. 
  At the initiative of Minatom and the "Rosenergoatom" 
concern, the RF government has made several decisions aimed at 
stabilizing the financial situation in the nuclear power 
complex; however, these have not improved the situation 
substantially. In the first two months of 1994, nuclear power 
stations were paid for only 25 percent of the electrical energy 
they supplied. 
  At the present time, the "Rosenergoatom" concern, along 
with the "YeES Rossiya" RAO, is striving to reduce indebtedness 
by means of the mutual cancellation of debts, the introduction 
of bill of exchange circulation, the payment of debts in the 
form of goods, and so on. 
  [Signed] Concern President Ye. N. Pozdyshev 
  With this letter, the concern's president, whom RABOCHAYA 
TRIBUNA editors thank for his attention to their publication, 
also sent six pages of appendixes. Especially interesting is 
appendix No. 3, "A List of Government Decisions on the Issue of 
Financial Provision for Nuclear Power Work." The list contains 
12 decisions, and only one of them is marked: "Implemented." 
  What about the rest? Ominous formulations: "To ensure the 
immediate implementation, . . ." "Take immediate exhaustive 
measures. Report. Deadline 10 days," "Within a week's time, 
finish putting together and distributing financial funds. . . . 
Report to Russian government on implementation by 10 December." 
If, God forbid, a new Chernobyl ever comes crashing down, 
someone is going to use these notes to compose an entire story 
of how people tried to avert disaster. In conclusion, we will 
mention two documents. 
  Here is an instruction from the chairman of the RF 
government's Council of Ministers, V. S. Chernomyrdin, No. 
VCh-P14-41316, of 4 December 1993, to B. G. Fedorov, V. V. 
Gerashchenko, O. N. Soskovets, and Ye. T. Gaydar on a working 
memo from the first deputy head of the department of industry, 
O. S. Pushkareva, of 3 December 1993, no. P14-11-1133, "On the 
Emergency Situation in Russian Nuclear Power." 
  On the document is Fedorov's instruction to Gerashchenko: 
"Situation critical. I ask you to submit within three 
days' time proposals for stabilizing the financial situation in 
nuclear power." 
  Here is an instruction from the first deputy chairman of the 
RF government, O. N. Soskovets, of 22 January 1994, no. 
OS-P14-01786, on the subject of a letter from the Russian State 
Committee on Emergency Situations about the critical situation 
in nuclear power. 
  It is addressed to Minatom (to S. K. Dubinin), the Bank of 
Russia (V. I. Solovov), the Russian Ministry of Fuel and Energy 
(Mintopenergo) (V. N. Kostyukin), and "YeES Rossiya" RAO (A. F. 
Dyakov). The words are more than alarming: "Multiple 
instructions from the government of the Russian Federation on 
this issue . . . have been systematically ignored, which is 
having a substantial effect on the safety of nuclear power 
stations. I ask you, in conjunction with Minatom and other 
interested organizations, to examine without delay the issues 
involved in the financial stabilization of nuclear power 
stations and to take effective measures." 
  The note on both documents reads: NOT IMPLEMENTED.

<F P=106> [INTERFAX report under the "Aviation" rubric: "`Aeroflot' </F>
May Lose Its Airbuses"] 
  [Text] The "Aeroflot" Russian International Airlines 
carrier may lose all its five A310-300 jumbo aircraft leased to 
Russia by European Airbus Industrie in early 1992. 
  Valeriy Eksuzian, general director of "Aeroflot's" affiliate 
company, "Russian Airlines," which operates the five aircraft, 
has told INTERFAX that "unless the government reaffirms its 
guarantees of 1991, the aircraft will have to be returned to a 
consortium of West European banks which is currently their 
owner." 
  The Russian Federation Government decree of 10 March 1994 
"On 
Approving Import Customs Duty Rates" calls for a 50-percent 
import tariff on aircraft. At the same time, the five A310-300 
were leased upon government authorization in 1991, and the 
leasing contract envisioned that the aircraft would be exempt 
from customs duties and value added tax. 
  According to the "Russian Airlines" company, any delays in 
or 
failure to make leasing payments will result in the Western 
partners' immediate move to ground the jumbo jets. 
  "This will result in our losing the international flights 
market worth $100 million, which we are still being able to keep 
by providing services in line with international standards with 
the help of Airbus Industrie's aircraft," Yuriy Korenevskiy, 
Russian Federation deputy transport minister, said. In his 
words, "Aeroflot" will have to forgo the leasing of a new batch 
of four Boeing-767's. 
  The total value of the five A310-300's is $350 million. 
Leasing payments in 1993 amounted to $49 million. In 1993, the 
A310-300's carried 350,792 passengers and around 5,500 tonnes of 
cargo.

<H5>  Almaz Shipbuilding Company </H5>
  The Almaz Shipbuilding Company in St. Petersburg, under 
contract to the Morskiye Sistemy Sukhogo Joint-Stock Company, 
has begun construction of the prototype of a series of passenger 
vessels with a small waterplane area (SMPV) -- the first ship of 
this type in domestic shipbuilding. The Agat Design Enterprise 
drew up the technical design (A-4) in 1992. The work 
documentation is specified for total completion in the 3d 
quarter of 1993. 
<H6>  Basic Elements and Statistics </H6>

  The choice of the company to build the first SMPV with 
all-welded hull and superstructures made of high-strength 
aluminum-magnesium alloys was not a random one. For more than 
one decade, the enterprise has specialized in building naval 
ships and special ships with dynamic support principles, in 
particular, surface-effect vessels with steel and AMg-alloy 
hulls. Some of the naval ships built have no analogs with 
respect to performance and structure in domestic shipbuilding 
and even in the world. 
  The new passenger ship, developed in accordance with the 
conversion program, is distinguished by its irregular contours, 
particularly those of the subsurface hulls, powerful main power 
unit with Z-shaped drive to two engines, unique system of 
reversing the ship and moderation of pitching. There are many 
new, non-traditional engineering designs in the structure of the 
SMPV. The passengers are ensured comfort when the sea conditions 
are five points on the scale. 
  Among the suppliers of the ship's basic engineering 
equipment, gear and finishing and building elements are such 
well-known firms as MTU (FRG) -- main engines; Sperry Marine 
(United States) -- complete control system; NPO [Scientific 
Production Association] imeni N.Ya. Klimov -- angle reduction 
gears; ANTK imeni A.N. Tupolev -- passenger lounge equipment. 
  The collective of engineers and specialists of the Almaz 
company, headed by A.P. Korolev, general director, has 
confidence in the successful development of the prototype ship, 
and in the future, of series construction of various 
modifications of the SMPV. (Yu.N. Peresvetov). 
<H5>  Krasnoye Sormovo Yard Production Association </H5>
  On 13 March of this year, the plant launched the next cargo 
motorship of the "river-sea" type, the Volga. This ship, ordered 
by the Roschart Company, has been named Myskhako. 
  The Sormovo workers are planning to broaden the export of 
their ships. These are, mainly, ships of the Volga type, with a 
cargo capacity of 4,000/5,500 t, of the Nizhniy Novgorod type 
(or Ni NO-3000, design 19611), with an average cargo capacity of 
3,000 t, and the Rossiya type (design 17310) with a cargo 
capacity of 2,000/3,000 t. The set of documents for these ships 
was turned over for expert examination to the specialists of Det 
Norske Veritas classification society, to ensure that the export 
orders conform to the maximum to Western standards. On the 
whole, the ship meets the basic requirements of foreign 
shipowners and supervisory bodies. Motorships of the Volga type, 
however, for example, were marked by a relatively low level of 
automated ship control, and a large crew; the radio-navigation 
equipment is not up to the mark and some materials not 
recommended in the West (asbestos-containing) are used. 
  In the process of negotiations with the Norwegian firms, the 
possibility of supplying other ships, including tankers, was 
discussed. 
<H5>  Yaroslavl Shipyard </H5>
  The search for solvent buyers has been the yard's main 
problem recently. The yard often has to develop new ships at its 
own expense, since the traditional buyers often find themselves 
insolvent on the financial plane. Because of this, fishing 
trawlers, usually supplied to domestic enterprises, are 
increasingly often shipped overseas. For example, a contract was 
concluded with an Egyptian firm to build six freezer 
seine-trawlers from the modernized design 503. Alexandria will 
be the port of registry of the first one of them. 
<H5>  Severnoye Machine Building Enterprise Production Association </H5>
  The association carried out 357 measures of the re-equipment 
plan in 1992. As a result, labor input was reduced by 562,000 
norm-hrs, and the level of manual labor was reduced to 34.1 
percent. Among the most important measures carried out are 
preparation to put into operation a new three-roll sheet-bending 
machine with a laser device, development of a completely 
mechanized line and a new press to face the boards of 
cabinet-type furniture with veneer, and installation and 
development of nine new digitally controlled metal-cutting 
machine tools. 
  The following were included among the next tasks to improve 
production in 1993: developing a water-screen for the gas 
cutting of rolled sheet metal in hull-machining production, 
equipping the steel-smelting furnaces with hydro-gas-purifying 
systems, developing a unit to purify oven gases to melt glass, 
converting forging furnaces from mazut to gas, rebuilding the 
thermal subdivision for instrument production, etc. At the same 
time, conserving fuel, power and material resources and solving 
ecological problems are also priority goals. 
<H5>  Perm Kama Shipyard </H5>
  The plant is mastering the building of small freezer shrimp 
trawlers (design 13307). They are designed to catch tropical 
shrimp with beam trawls and fish with a deep-sea trawl, using a 
stern trawling system, and also with a purse seine and a cone 
net, using electric light. The catch is frozen in 
horizontal-slab devices and an air-freezing locker. The trawlers 
are designed at the Kiev Leninskaya Kuznitsa Central Design 
Bureau, and are built to Registry class KM "Star" 1AZ (fishing).

  A 6VD 18/16 AL-2 diesel with 450 kW power is used as the 
main 
engine. 
<H5>  Aksay Fleet REB [Repair-Operations Base] </H5>
  The Aksay Repair-Operations Base of the river fleet, located 
in Aksay, in Rostov Oblast, is planning to begin building 
river-sea type cargo ships. The technical-economic 
substantiation for rebuilding and expanding the enterprise was 
made with the participation of the Hamburg firm, Blohm and Voss. 
It will take about 150 million German Marks, with a recovery 
period of 8-12 years, to put the project into effect. The 
possibility of building at least seven Sormovskiy type 
motorships a year is specified. Moreover, only the ship hulls 
will be formed, and their equipment and outfitting is to be 
carried out with the resources of two other enterprises at 
Rostov-on-Don -- the RIF Joint-Stock Company and Krasnyy Don. In 
addition, major ship repair work is planned. In particular, the 
Volga-Don Shipping Company AO [Joint-Stock Company] is 
interested in the realization of this project, and has already 
invested certain funds in modernizing the enterprise. In the 
near future, the Aksay Fleet REB will become a joint-stock 
company, and some of its shares will be offered to the investors 
to go toward clearing off the loan. 
<H5>  Neva Planning-Design Bureau </H5>
  One of the conversion projects of this bureau is a 
medium-sized freezer-longliner trawler (design 13010). The ship 
is designed to fish with deep-sea and bottom trawls, as well as 
with a ground line. The fish-processing equipment provides the 
output of frozen cut-up fish products, including filets, and 
ground fish for feed. The ship class is KM "Star" L2AZ (fishing). 
  The main power unit is a single-shaft, two-machine 
diesel-reduction unit based on 6Ch N22/24 diesels with 2X973 kW. 
Two shaft-driven generators (2X630 kW) and a diesel-generator 
(350 kW) are also stipulated. The variable-pitch screw (196 rpm) 
is 2.8 m in diameter. The bow thruster has 135 kW power. The set 
of commercial devices for trawl fishing will be 
Russian-Norwegian-made (RossNor Joint-Stock Company). The cargo 
system includes a hydraulic crane (1.8 t with an 8-meter radius) 
and two cargo booms, 3.2 t each. The refrigeration equipment 
consists of four compressor units, ensuring a temperature of 
-28C in the holds, and three horizontal-slab freezer units 
with a total productivity of 36 t/day. A series of ships of this 
design is to be built for Russian buyers at the Zvezdochka 
Machine Building Enterprise in Severodvinsk.

<H5>  Chernomorskiy Shipyard </H5>
  Because the yard has stopped building heavy 
aircraft-carrying 
cruisers, problems have arisen with the work load of a number of 
production shops, and because of this, the idea is being 
discussed of organizing a shipbuilding concern in Nikolayev, 
which would include the Chernomorskiy Shipyard, the Shipyard 
imeni 61 Kommunar and the Okean Shipyard. This would make it 
possible to load their shops more uniformly, accordingly 
redistributing the orders for performing work done, for example, 
on manufacturing hull structures or producing machine building 
items. This concern would also have its own bank. It is possible 
that scientific institutions, UkrNIITS, for example, might join 
this association. In jointly solving, under mutually 
advantageous conditions, the problems facing the enterprises, 
the participants in this sort of association must at the same 
time retain financial independence and bear the responsibility 
for the results of their work. 
<H5>  Almaz TsMKB [Central Marine Design Bureau] </H5>
  The Almaz Central Marine Design Bureau, within the framework 
of its conversion, has drawn up a design for a high-speed 
surface-effect skeg-type passenger-motor vehicle ferry, 
tentatively named the Mistral. The ship was created on the basis 
of the missile boat, Sivuch (NATO code name -- Dergach].

  The ferry can take on board 352 passengers and 67 motor 
vehicles. The sea-keeping qualities are ensured at sea waves up 
to 6 points. 
  In addition to this ship, export versions, based on this 
design, of missile, anti-submarine and patrol ships, as well as 
Coast Guard ships, have been developed. Their total displacement 
is 750-850 t, maximum speed 45 knots, cruising range under 
displacement conditions -- 2,000 miles, and on air cushion -- 
500 miles. 
<H5>  Kherson Shipbuilding Association </H5>
  The next Arctic supply ship of the Ivan Papanin type will 
sail under the Chinese flag. The "christening" of the new ship, 
which was named Snow Dragon, took place in April of this year. 
This ship -- the first of this type in the Chinese People's 
Republic -- will be used for Antarctic expeditions. Construction 
of the next supply ship has continued at the building berth. Its 
name and the port of registry have not yet been determined. 
  During approximately the same period, the association laid 
the keel of a new tanker-products-carrier. This ship differs 
somewhat from the preceding series of tankers with a deadweight 
of 28,000 t, through the reduced capacity of the cargo tanks 
(board depth of the preceding tankers was 3 m more). Other 
wishes of buyers, particularly those from Norway, have also been 
taken into consideration. 
<H5>  Chaykovskiy Fleet REB </H5>
  The Chaykovskiy Repair-Operations Base of the river fleet 
(city of Chaykovskiy, Perm Oblast) is planning to build, in 
1993-1994, pusher-tugs with 440 kW power, using Design No 81172 
of the Sudostroyeniye Design Bureau Scientific Production 
Association. These river ships (River Registry class "O," ice) 
are designed to push dry-cargo consists and bulk barges with a 
total cargo capacity of up to 5,000 t, as well as to tow rafts 
and barges. 
<H6>  Basic Elements and Statistics </H6>

  Three variations of the tug have been worked out, depending 
on the type of towing and coupling devices used. The means of 
automation used on the ship provides the possibility of the 
power unit operating without a constant watch in the engine room. 
<H5>  Shipyard imeni 61 Kommunar </H5>
  In accordance with a Ukrainian government decision, this 
yard 
will undergo 100-percent conversion. The shipyard, founded over 
200 years ago especially to build the Russian Naval Fleet, has 
already cut back the volumes of building new naval ships from 80 
to 20 percent. Finishing work and repair is being carried out 
for a number of buyers. At the same time, the financial capital 
promised by the government to convert production to the output 
of civilian ships and to modernize it is being withheld. The 
situation with respect to supplies of completing equipment, and 
the introduction of Ukraine's own currency -- the karbovanets -- 
have become difficult. After all, the yard obtains up to 80 
percent of ship mechanisms, devices and instruments, as well as 
materials, from Russia. Nevertheless, the yard is expanding the 
program for the output of products for civilian purposes. A new 
design of transport refrigerator is being built, and contacts 
with new buyers, including foreign ones, are being developed. 
<H5>  Feodosiya More Production Association </H5>
  The enterprise has begun series construction of three types 
of sea-going passenger hydrofoils. The prototype SPK 
[hydrofoil], Voskhod-2M, was launched at the beginning of 
January this year. Ten months passed from the laying of its keel 
in the building berth to its launching. According to some 
estimates, in a few years the association will be able to 
produce up to ten of these ships a year. 
  Another prototype SPK, the Olimpiya, was launched on the eve 
of 1993. While it took about two years to build this ship, 
series SPK of this type should be built at quadruple the rate. 
At the beginning of the year the keels were laid in the building 
berth for four SPK of the Olimpiya type. Diesels from the German 
MTU firm were installed on them as the main engine. 
  After the successful operation of the prototype double-deck 
gas-turbine-powered Tsiklon on the Tallinn-Helsinki line, it was 
decided to continue building ships of this type, but in a 
modernized version. The keel was laid for the Tsiklon-M SPK on 
18 December 1992. 
<H5>  Okean Shipyard </H5>
  The yard has began construction of a prototype ship with a 
deadweight of about 8,000 t, with a horizontal cargo-processing 
method. This rolker, for mixed sailing, is 140 m long and 16 m 
wide, and has a board depth of 8 m. The two main diesels, 
turning the two screw propellers, make it possible for it to get 
up to a speed of 13.5 knots. Wheel-and-track equipment will be 
loaded and unloaded along a cargo ramp. The ship is also 
suitable to transport international standard containers, both in 
the holds and on the upper deck. It is built on the order of the 
Ukrainian Delta Scientific Production Corporation. The Okean 
Shipyard is developing ships of this type for the first time, 
and they will replace the small fish-factory bases in the 
building berths, after the last ship of that series is turned 
over. 
<H5>  Sever Production Association </H5>
  Screw propellers are among the types of goods produced by 
the 
Sever Production Association. To raise the quality of the 
screws, designed particularly for hydrofoils, specialists of the 
St. Petersburg State Marine Technology University, by order of 
this Production Association, are carrying out research and 
experimental work on using a theodolite-computer system to 
measure the geometrical parameters of the screws being produced 
by the association's specialized subdivision. The ultimate goal 
of the work is to increase the precision of the measurements, 
and optimize the technology of the marking-out and control 
operations.

  The enterprise has begun series production of P1-PKV 
crystallizers -- special devices to intensify the process of 
sugar crystallization. The use of these devices will make it 
possible to increase the production of the prepared product at 
sugar plants, at the same time simplifying the procedure for 
controlling the manufacturing process.

  The Arkhangelsk Oblast Council of the Shipbuilding 
Scientific 
Technical Association imeni Academician A.N. Krylov, summed up 
the results of a competition for the best work on mechanizing 
and improving manufacturing processes. The following works by 
association specialists were commended with honorary diplomas: 
"An Automated System for Producing a Set of Planning-Engineering 
Documents, Based on a Local Personal Computer Network" (E.S. 
Khandanyats), "Remote Control of Power and Heating Pump 
Stations" (P.A. Marin, Yu.M. Kotsov, V.O. Levshin), "A Stand for 
Testing Automatic Devices of the Elektron Series" (I.K. 
Chekrygin, Ye.F. Yermolin, V.A. Shilnikov), "Introduction of an 
MRN 340-01 Contact Machine for Group Projection Welding of Wire 
Screens" (V.I. Sergevnin, V.Ye. Sherstnev, G.G. Golyakov), 
"Modernization of the Gripping Mechanism of an M10P.62.01 
Industrial Robot, Included as Part of an RTK [Robot-Technology 
Complex]" (A.V. Popov, V.M. Pozdeyev). 
<H5>  Vint Scientific Production Association </H5>
  One of the latest works of the association's specialists is 
developing the structure of an active water-jet-type rudder 
(ARV). This rudder is designed for installation on transport, 
passenger, fishing and other vessels, in order to increase 
maneuverability in forward and reverse motion, and also to 
provide low speed for the ship when the main engine is switched 
off. The ARV is distinguished by increased reliability and 
ecological safety, which are ensured by the degree to which the 
working element is protected against mechanical damage and 
auto-rotation, and by eliminating from the design seals, angle 
gearing or a submerged electric motor in the sea space, 
characteristic of traditional active rudder systems.

  When the ARV is in operation, the water enters through 
notches in the side surfaces of the rudder blade, or at the ends 
of it, to an axial or centrifugal pump. The appropriate driving 
force is created by the reaction of the jet of water ejected 
through a nozzle in the stern edges of the rudder blade. An 
experimental model of an ARV with 47 kW power has now been 
developed to fit type SRT fishing boats. 
<H5>  Monolit Central Design Bureau </H5>
  This design bureau, located in Gorodets, in Nizhegorod 
Oblast, is the leading organization in shipbuilding in the field 
of designing ships with reinforced concrete hulls, floating 
repair, transport and launching docks, floating and 
floating-stand berths for various purposes, floating workshops, 
floating restaurants and hotels, and other vessels. 
  The basic advantages of ships with a reinforced concrete 
hull 
include low metal-intensity and construction cost, low operating 
costs (no dry-docking and painting required when in operation), 
good durability and simple repair. 
  The following ships are now being series-built at various 
enterprises from designs of the Monolit Central Design Bureau 
Joint-Stock Company: floating composite and metal repair docks 
with a load capacity of 5,000 t (including those for docking 
ships of the fishing industry fleet), floating workshops with a 
reinforced concrete hull, floating berths, metal and reinforced 
concrete, 154 and 108 m long, berthside pontoons, and floating 
cranes with a load capacity of 5 t. 
  Specialists of the Central Design Bureau are also producing 
designs for dimensional modernization of docks, and are 
preparing the documentation to provide marine communications for 
ships running along inland waterways. 
<H5>  PeterGaz Joint Venture </H5>
  This Dutch-Russian joint venture (partners -- Kheerema Oil 
and Gas Development and the Gas Industry) will design and build 
an underwater gas pipeline through Baydaratskaya Bay, which will 
connect the large gas deposits of Yamal with the main West 
Siberian gas pipeline. The 70-km underwater section of the route 
will include eight pipelines (1.22 m in diameter each), along 
which 170 billion m[.sup]3[/] of natural gas a year can be 
transported. The first two pipelines, worth $570 million, should 
be laid by 1996, and the last of them is planned to be put into 
operation in the year 2005. A number of Russian firms will be 
drawn in to carry out the marine part of the project. Work will 
be done under exceptionally difficult natural conditions. 
Suffice to say that Baydaratskaya Bay, located beyond the Arctic 
circle, is ice-free for a maximum of 100 days a year. The total 
cost of the project is estimated at several billion dollars. 
  The materials used in the reports were from the 
newspapers SUDOSTROITEL, OKEAN, MORE, VODNYY TRANSPORT, KORABEL, 
TRUDOVAYA VAKHTA, KRASNYY SORMOVICH and others, as well as from 
publicity brochures and materials given to the editors by 
enterprises and organizations.

<F P=106> [Interview with V. Kadannikov, general director of the </F>
AvtoVAZ Joint-Stock Company, by correspondent N. Mogzharetto: 
"VAZ--For Us Or Not About Us? One Million People Work at VAZ"] 
  [Text] In recent years it seems that we have adjusted 
to everything, but still the new prices introduced for the 
Zhiguli in December are staggering. Here we have already passed 
up the Opal and Chrysler in terms of cost and we are catching up 
with the Mercedes. Apparently, finding no buyers for their 
products, the automotive plant stood idle during all of January 
and only in February did it produce its first motor vehicle. 
During these days our correspondent N. Mogzharetto met with the 
general director of the AvtoVAZ Joint-Stock Company, V. 
Kadannikov. 
  [Kadannikov] The situation at the automotive plant is the 
same as it is throughout all of industry and throughout our 
entire economy. Because of the shortage of batching materials 
and items and nonpayments it was necessary to shut the plant 
down for a month. Plus a lot of work for repairing equipment and 
readjusting it for the Desyatka had accumulated. The collective 
went to work on 1 February and since that time it has been 
fulfilling its very tight schedule each day. 
  Now about the plant's development. It is simply impossible 
to 
imagine an automotive company that never updates its products. 
But to put a new motor vehicle on the conveyor takes $2-2.5 
billion. Today there are no centralized sources but, 
unfortunately, there is also nothing to take their place. 
Therefore we created the All-Russian Automotive Alliance, whose 
main task is to put a new motor vehicle into production. And we 
are speaking about a completely new model--the VAZ-1116. It will 
be a five-door "hatchback" which is suitable for conditions in 
the city and at the same time is high-speed (the experimental 
model which I have seen reminds one a little of the well-known 
Italian vehicle Fiat-Tipo.--I.M.) 
  [Mogzharetto] And the Desyatka--will it come into being? 
  [Kadannikov] Approximately 70 percent of the investments 
have 
been made in the "2110" family and series production will begin 
at the end of the year. During 1995 we plan to reach our 
projected capacities and at the same time gradually phase out 
our oldest motor vehicle, the VAZ-2106. The VAZ-2105, -07, -04, 
-08, -09, the Niva and the Oka will remain, but they will be 
thoroughly modernized. For example, we have already begun to 
make a longer five-door version of the Niva. Moreover, we are in 
negotiations with the General Motors firm concerning the 
production of a model of the Opal-Course in Tolyatti. 
  The Desyatka family itself consists of three motor vehicles: 
the VAZ-2110 sedan itself, the VAZ-2111--with a "hatchback" 
body, and the 2112--"universal." There are several versions of 
the engine: the conventional carburetor engine with a capacity 
of 1.5 liters, the modernized one with a capacity of 1.7 liters, 
and the new injection engine with 16 valves. 
  [Mogzharetto] It is very nice that under conditions of 
economic crisis you are putting a new model on the conveyor. 
But, excuse me, why is it needed if the price of even the old 
one has exceeded all possible bounds? Moreover, our vehicle 
costs less, say, in France, than it does in Russia. 
  [Kadannikov] Our whole life is to blame for the fact that we 
are selling vehicles at that price. Last year prices of 
materials and batching items rose on average 6.63-fold, and the 
motor vehicle prices--4.2-fold. 
  If you compare the prices of the Zhiguli there and here, 
taking into account our exchange rate of the ruble to the 
dollar, it turns out that they are higher here. Because the 
exchange rate itself does not reflect the actual relationship 
between the ruble and the dollar. There, of course, our Desyatka 
will not cost $10,000, but that is not because the price is 
different but because the dollar relative to the ruble is 
different. The ruble's actual buying power relative to the 
dollar is about 1.5 times less, and the government is 
maintaining this exchange rate artificially. Additionally, in a 
number of cases our prices really do turn out to be higher than 
in the West, if only because many of our plants are operating 
like social security organizations. 
  [Mogzharetto] And that is why you "put so much pressure" on 
our government that effective next year it will introduce 
monstrous duties on foreign brands. Because it turned out that 
it was cheaper to buy a new Opal or Renault than a Desyatka. 
  [Kadannikov] All the mass media are accusing me of causing 
that--introducing these taxes, lobbying the government, etc. I 
can say--cross my heart--that neither I nor any of the members 
of our board had anything to do with that decree. It is an 
ordinary fiscal law generated in the bosom of the Ministry of 
Finance, and the taxes that are planned will go not for the 
development of the domestic automotive industry but for purposes 
unknown to me. 
  I think it would be impossible to abolish the importation of 
motor vehicles into Russia. At the present time we have 
approximately 15 million passenger cars in operation in the 
country. Our entire industry produces 900,000 motor vehicles a 
year, of which 300,000 are sold abroad. Thus it would take us 25 
years to replace the fleet of motor vehicles. This is 
impossible, no motor vehicle runs that long. And if we do not 
ship in foreign brands our fleet will become extremely 
"obsolete," which will lead to accidents, deaths, pollution of 
the environment, etc. In many places the replacement of the 
automotive fleet is financed directly by the state. For example, 
in Greece, where motor vehicles are not produced, three years 
ago the government decided to allot a very large amount of 
money--and everyone who sold an old motor vehicle could buy a 
new one from the state with preferential credit. As a result, 
the automotive fleet was updated in a short period of time. 
  There is no country that would not protect its producers 
with 
import taxes. There are protective measures like this that are 
worse than ours--in some places more intelligent, in some places 
less so. But if we are to speak seriously about the market and 
are concerned about our citizens, we must not raise the question 
of banning the importation of foreign makes. And we must work on 
the domestic market as we work on the foreign market, under 
conditions of competition. To me that is the natural course of 
events. 
  [Mogzharetto] Is it true that after the regular price 
increase the plant was overstocked with Zhigulis and they would 
not sell? 
  [Kadannikov] No, that is not true. There are 1,500 motor 
vehicles on the lot and it might seem to someone on the outside 
that the plant has overstocked. But that, excuse me, is a half 
day's output. But, naturally, the sales level declines after 
each price increase. When we raise prices everyone is in shock 
for a month or two. But then the demand levels out. [end 
Kadannikov] 
  FROM THE EDITORS. We turned the floor over to V. 
Kadannikov--this is his viewpoint. But there are also 
others--for example, according to certain information, it was 
namely the leaders of the LogoVAZ Joint-Stock Company, V. 
Berezovskiy and V. Kadannikov, who actively "put their minds" to 
getting new customs duties introduced. Thus they are trying to 
attract foreign investments to the domestic automotive industry. 
But the investments (if there are any) will produce a return 
five years from now, while the Russians need an inexpensive 
motor vehicle today....

<F P=106> [Interview with A. Krasnenker, LogoVAZ director, by Yu. </F>
Skidanov: "Why Ladas Are Cheaper: Encountering Market Laws, 
LogoVAZ Chooses New Priorities"] 
  [Text] While everything else has been getting more 
expensive, LogoVAZ declared a price reduction on its automobiles 
made at the Volga Motor Vehicle Plant (VAZ). A month has passed 
since then. Has this pricing policy been vindicated, given the 
situation of galloping inflation? Responding to this question is 
the director of LogoVAZ for the Zhiguli, Aleksandr 
Krasnenker. 
  [Krasnenker] The February price reduction had a tangible 
economic effect: today we are selling about 100 automobiles per 
day. This was the choice: either drive up prices for VAZes sky 
high and take our income from the sale of 15-20 automobiles a 
day, or else win at the expense of large turnover, selling 
automobiles at relatively affordable prices. We chose the 
latter. And we weren't wrong. LogoVAZ is selling about 30,000 
automobiles a year, which is equal to about 10 percent of VAZ's 
production program for the countries of the former Union. We 
have offices operating in more than 20 cities of the 
CIS--Moscow, St. Petersburg, Bishkek. . . . 
  [TRUD] Nevertheless, currency prices for Zhigulis and Ladas 
are quite high. 
  [Krasnenker] That depends on what you compare them to. If 
you 
buy an automobile from just anyone at a used car lot or at some 
dubious street outlet, you are scarcely safeguarded against all 
the various troubles you might have. Unfortunately, virtually 
everything connected with automobiles here is thickly overgrown 
with crime. Purchasing a car from LogoVAZ eliminates very many 
of the most likely troubles you might have. 
  People know that. I will list only some of the benefits to 
our buyers. First of all, our cars come with an 18-month factory 
warranty. We guarantee complete security for our clients. It is 
no secret, after all, that if you get a new automobile from some 
middleman, you might barely be out of the parking spot when you 
fall into the hands of thugs acting in collusion. Furthermore, 
we can provide delivery of a car to virtually any point in the 
CIS, and if an enterprise or commercial structure purchases a 
good-sized lot of cars, we can offer a discount of up to $1000 
per vehicle. 
  [TRUD] Recently I spent some time at the Honda factories in 
Japan and was interested there in how they work with clients. 
Simple things amazed me: the buyer is always right. They love 
him. And they emphasize this in all sorts of ways, starting with 
a cup of coffee while they are discussing the purchase of one 
make of automobile or other and ending with advice about what 
upholstery to choose for the interior. Why doesn't it work like 
this here? Is it because LogoVAZ has a virtual monopoly on the 
sale of automobiles and you are not stimulated by healthy 
competition? 
  [Krasnenker] We're doing fine as far as competition goes, I 
assure you. There are dozens of small firms trading in Volga 
motor vehicles. But people come to us. Why? Because for the same 
money we offer many advantages in the purchase of an automobile. 
I'm not going to talk about coffee, like at Honda, but here, for 
example, following the example of Western leaders, we are 
learning how to do custom work, gaining in quality of service, 
maximal good will toward the customer, and our ability to solve 
his problems. When you buy an automobile you can order, "without 
walking away from the cashier," additional equipment, an 
anti-theft device, anti-corrosion treatment, car cassette-radio, 
and so on. If you live, let's say, in Bishkek, again, then you 
can buy any model VAZ through your local LogoVAZ office. They 
will get it to you within an agreed-upon length of time. This is 
the system for custom work. 
  Moreover, LogoVAZ specialists continue to pay attention to 
the car you buy even after the sale, unlike, say, the so-called 
re-export models. Think about the way people used to buy 
automobiles: once you had driven out of the gates, no one cared 
about your problems anymore. Should a serious defect be 
uncovered immediately after the purchase of the car, LogoVAZ 
makes an effort to resolve these problems without additional 
payment. You see, the time has passed when people bought 
automobiles indiscriminately, following the principle, "Thank 
God I got it." Now there is choice; the automobile market is 
well saturated. The only way you can be successful is by 
improving service. 
  [TRUD] Or "lobbying," for instance. Let us recall the recent 
introduction of draconian duties on imported automobiles. 
  [Krasnenker] Some people would really like to ascribe that 
service to the VAZ structures. But let's reason logically. 
LogoVAZ sells more than just Zhigulis; we have plenty of other 
lines as well--Volvo, Mercedes, Honda, used foreign makes, and 
so forth. Therefore, the new duties raised definite problems 
around the sale of those automobiles. Taking these circumstances 
into account, it is hard to see your suggestions as convincing. 
Moreover, VAZ automobiles don't need that kind of protection on 
the domestic market. Yes, you can find many advantages to 
foreign models. But for our roads, for our oil and gasoline, 
Ladas are better adapted. A VAZ can be repaired in virtually any 
city in Russia or the CIS, and any driver can give advice even 
on the highway about how to take care of a problem. With foreign 
makes, you'll agree, this is somewhat harder to do. 
  [TRUD] We know that the auto industry in Russia, and AvtoVAZ 
in particular, are not experiencing the best of times. Nor is it 
any secret that investment in the development of transportation 
is highly profitable. This is obviously why the state, through 
the Aeroflot bank, has directed 1.7 trillion credit rubles into 
the reconstruction of the Moscow airports and updating air 
transport. Would this kind of policy be justified with respect 
to automobile building? 
  [Krasnenker] Certainly. It could achieve a long-term 
economic 
effect. LogoVAZ and especially the Zhiguli management are 
operating on a commercial basis, so we rely on our own forces. 
We are interested in improving quality and updating models for 
VAZ automobiles. For this to happen regularly takes extensive 
investments. Naturally, as world experience shows, these 
expenditures are repaid with interest, allowing, apart from 
everything else, for an update in technology and production all 
along the chain of plants that tie in to the production of an 
automobile. This means dozens of major enterprises. It is just 
this kind of approach that has the right to be called an 
economically regulated policy. I think that sooner or later the 
manager of state credits is going to reach a similar conclusion. 
It would be good for this to happen sooner, though. After all, 
the rate at which Zhigulis are bought up is very high; demand 
for this make is not falling. 
  The telephone numbers for the LogoVAZ showroom in Moscow are 
249-00-51, 546-07-80, and 140-52-31.

<F P=106> [Report on MPS [Ministry of Railways] Collegium meeting and </F>
selector conference by N. Davydov: "The Railroads' Financial 
Condition Is Nearly Critical"] 
  [Text] The economic situation in railroad transportation in 
the January-March period is cause for alarm. A program for 
stabilizing the sector's work was outlined at the expanded 
collegium in December. It was based on optimistic government 
forecasts which predicted the production decline would be about 
5 percent in the first quarter. And railroad employees handled 
their transactions accordingly. 
  However, in the first 2 months of this year, the volume of 
freight shipped dropped by 21.2 percent compared with the same 
period in 1993. And the reserves which should have been put into 
use in such a situation essentially were not even defined 
clearly enough. The most important economic levers such as 
marketing, advertising, differentiated rates, contracts with 
clients, and so forth turned out to be very poorly adapted. 
Although they could have at least reduced the harmful effect of 
the plummeting decline in shipment volumes. 
  As Minister of Railways G.M. Fadeyev emphasized in his 
statements at the collegium, the sector's financial 
condition is nearly critical. For the first time in recent 
years, the January results were unprofitable. We are just 
about to sum up the February results, but it can already be said 
that losses of about 150 billion rubles [R] are expected. It is 
precisely for this reason that it has become necessary to 
discuss the situation at a special collegium session and to 
define the tasks for each administration in the ministry in 
order to reduce operating expenditures and look for additional 
incomes. 
  The report by Deputy Minister I.S. Besedin contained a 
detailed analysis of the losses which caused credit indebtedness 
to increase by R800 billion and debit indebtedness to increase 
by R400 billion by mid-March. In his opinion, the wage increase 
and the disparity between the operating work force and the work 
being performed are responsible for the largest proportion of 
costs. According to data from the VNIIZhT [All-Russian Railroad 
Transport Scientific Research Institute], there are about 
103,000 unneeded employees in the sector, mostly in the 
Locomotives and Railcars administrations. 
  The speaker noted that a problem of no less importance is 
the 
unwarranted failure to accept shipments in the transport plan. 
Some 25 million metric tons of freight were not included in the 
plans of the Moscow, Kemerovo, Southeastern, Northern, and other 
railroads in the January-March period. Although there are 40 
million metric tons of finished products remaining at 
enterprises. This attests to the fact that the railroads are not 
working with clients satisfactorily. 
  The report contained convincing data that the operating 
rolling stock--locomotives and railcars--far exceeds the number 
needed for the reduced transport volumes. In a number of 
regions, there is an unreasonable "race" of railcars, and many 
classification yards are making use of less than 50 percent of 
their capacities. As a whole, the losses attributable to 
inefficiency amount to about R400 billion. 
  There is no denying that after the report and the minister's 
address, many administration managers turned out to be in an 
unenviable position. After all, they were not required to give 
an account of the work performed, but to make specific proposals 
on how to make up for the January-February losses in March. That 
is, there should be measures to produce a result by tomorrow. 
  If the statements made by managers of the Locomotives, 
Railcars, Passenger, and Lines main administrations are viewed 
from this high standard, none of their suggestions will produce 
an immediate tangible return. Neither reducing the volume of 
locomotive and railcar repair, putting them in extended 
retirement, making more efficient use of passenger rolling 
stock, or extending the range of use of old materials in the 
track superstructure will produce the needed gain in such a 
brief period of time. 
  However, there were no "discoveries" in most of the other 
speeches, either. Acknowledgment that unneeded locomotives and 
railcars are being operated in the system (and these are huge 
material losses) was accompanied by the statement that some time 
is needed "to work out standards and guidelines and to find jobs 
for the people being dismissed." Proposals were made to toughen 
responsibility for exceeding the wage fund, to adjust wages for 
inefficient lines, to aim the bonus system not at fulfillment of 
volume indicators, but at increasing transport operations, and 
so forth. But once again, a considerable amount of time is 
needed to realize all this. 
  Perhaps what is hampering us most is the habit of depending 
on broad support, always counting on the state's help, said V.F. 
Pryadko, chief of the Finances Administration. But under the 
current conditions, it is time to say farewell to this and other 
things. The principal indicator of any enterprise now is its 
solvency. And for us to stop operating at a loss, we have to 
save R75 billion in all administrations during March. 
  However, it is very hard to accomplish this. Shippers' 
indebtedness for transportation service has already reached R1.7 
trillion. And this is with the payments of R900 billion since 
the beginning of the year. But problems with wage payments 
continue to be unresolved in a number of regions, since only 
one-third of the earnings are in cash. 
  Nearly everyone who spoke at the collegium touched upon the 
problem of settlements with railroad administrations of the CIS 
member states in one way or another. It was suggested that, 
inasmuch as Russia exports much more than it imports, it should 
switch to international principles in railcar use: the owner of 
a railcar should pay to operate on foreign territory. Otherwise, 
they say, we will always be in debt. Of course, the crossing 
points must be properly maintained for this. Generally speaking, 
we must seek to ship as much as possible in Russian territory, 
in spite of the circuitous routes. 
  I. A. Shinkevich, chairman of the trade union central 
committee, also expressed serious concern about the situation 
that has developed. In his opinion, many of the managers in 
local areas assume that it is up to the Ministry of Railways to 
find a way out of the crisis, and they are not doing anything 
themselves. Although the main questions--the work force and 
wages--are within their competence. 
  No one has a clear idea of what reserves exist. 
  As we see, most of the questions discussed in the collegium 
related to the interests of the entire system, and it was 
completely logical to hold a selector conference on the 
following day in order to quickly bring the collegium's decree 
to the attention of the managers of railroads and divisions and 
to exchange ideas on the most important problems of the day. 
  For those gathered in offices of the railroads and 
divisions, 
the speech by First Deputy Minister O.A. Moshenko certainly 
conveyed, in concentrated form, the sector leaders' 
preoccupation with the financial and economic situation that has 
taken shape. The top-priority task for every railroad and every 
enterprise is to bring expenditures into conformity with the 
existing transportation volumes. There are many things hampering 
this work, he said, and the impression is sometimes created that 
operations work is falling outside individual managers' field of 
vision. Quite a few examples were cited to confirm this. 
  In the stabilization program outlined by the December 
collegium, it was planned to increase locomotive productivity by 
2.8 percent, but it decreased by more than 4 percent. It was a 
similar picture with railcar productivity, their empty runs, and 
a number of other indicators. 
  Th first deputy minister called upon railroad managers to 
make corrections in their plans outlined in December in 
conformity with this collegium's decree. And first of all, to 
take a good look at the dead end sidings and inefficient routes 
to see whether it is time to close them in some places. A no 
less important reserve is the consolidation of divisions. The 
October Railroad put forward this initiative. But the employment 
program should be into effect completely, as outlined by the 
December collegium. 
  Judging by the statements made in the selector conference of 
managers of the Northern, Moscow, and Gorkiy railroads, the 
local areas are no less concerned about the situation that has 
developed and they are also trying to overcome the negative 
trends. There were also interesting approaches in resolving 
individual problems. V.M. Predybaylov, chief of the Northern 
Railroad, does not believe that all the unprofitable sidings and 
inefficient routes should be stopped, since they can be put into 
the category of approach lines in some places. 
  "It is unclear why the Gorkiy Railroad must hold its 
refrigerated railcar fleet in reserve," said the chief of the 
railroad, O.Kh. Sharadze. "When units come in from other areas, 
we are forced to unload them as quickly as possible. Clients 
would like to lease them, but there haven't been any here." 
  Incidentally, when the communications link was disconnected, 
one of the persons present noted: "It would be well worth while 
for Sharadze to read a little. He has had all the information 
needed on his desk since morning--a full picture of the 
railroad's operation." One automatically wondered whether that 
was why the Gorkiy Railroad was cited more than once in the 
collegium and the selector conference as a negative example with 
respect to operating or financial indicators. 
  This was only the beginning of the large amount of work to 
be 
done to bring Russia's railroad transport out of the extremely 
difficult situation. Tomorrow, 16 March, managers of the 
Transbaykal Railroad will come to Moscow. The next day, 
representatives of the October Railroad will come, and so forth. 
Together with the administration managers, the ministry will 
examine the situation on each railroad and work out 
recommendations for its specific conditions. Only after this 
will they be assured that the steps worked out jointly will 
produce the desired effect.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Pavlovich Vorobyev, chief of the South </F>
Urals Railroad, by V. Mikushin: "We Are Relying on Ourselves"] 
  [Text] Chelyabinsk--Several railroad managers have 
already spoken in GUDOK about the results of work last year and 
the beginning of this year, and analyzed results of the meeting 
between railroad employees and V. Chernomyrdin, the head of 
government. Our discussion on this topic today is with Ivan 
Pavlovich Vorobyev, chief of the South Urals Railroad. 
  [Vorobyev] I will not repeat what has been said by my 
colleagues from other mainlines, but the situation in transport 
is really very serious. And this is directly linked with the 
overall economic crisis not only in Russia, but the CIS 
countries as well. I realize that the government and the 
parliament want very much to stabilize the economic situation in 
the country, but alas, there are no opportunities--primarily 
financial opportunities--for this. Last year we were given 
roughly 20 percent of the state subsidies needed. Judging by the 
results of the past 2 months, we cannot receive this now, either. 
  [Mikushin] It appears that the government is counting on all 
sectors of the national economy to support themselves, including 
railroad transport. 
  [Vorobyev] That is true to a certain extent. But I also know 
that the process of determining the most important and promising 
sectors which require state investments (and which are 
profitable for the country) is being continued. I do not think 
the government will leave the railroads without support. 
  [Mikushin] What kind of specific assistance do you expect 
from the top? 
  [Vorobyev] I have never believed that the ministry should be 
"milked" endlessly: give, they say, give here and give there... 
We can earn for ourselves, as the results of last year show. But 
the picture changed drastically beginning in November: the 
increase in federal and local taxes instantaneously "consumed" 
all our profit, more than 60 percent of which we gave to the 
budgets. Essentially, the state put the hen that lays golden 
eggs on starvation rations. 
  All of us, both railroad workers and our clients, are being 
squeezed by nonpayments. We are owed about 120 billion rubles 
[R]. And we owe nearly R90 billion. It appears that the final 
result is in our favor, but what kind of benefit is this, and 
who benefits from it? Let us take the land tax as an example. 
Last year we paid about R70 billion for this. But why so much, 
we ask, if part of the transport service is unprofitable for us? 
We are meeting the local authorities halfway, but they are 
demanding more and more new deductions for their budget, at 
times without any consideration for the problems facing railroad 
workers. 
  [Mikushin] Ivan Pavlovich, would it not be better in this 
case to shut down a number of unpromising routes? Even if only 
to avoid losses. Then let the persons managing the oblasts and 
rayons decide whether they need the services of the railroad or 
not. 
  [Vorobyev] I have had the same thought many times. Let us 
take the 200-kilometer Berdush-Druzhinino route. A pair of 
freight trains and the same number of passenger trains use this 
route daily. The same situation applies on the Miass-Uchaly 
section, where the daily traffic consists of just 30 railcars. 
On the railroad as a whole, there are about 1,500 kilometers 
of such unprofitable routes. Without receiving any incomes, we 
are still compelled to keep hundreds of people, locomotives, and 
railcars there and maintain service. Based on market conditions, 
routes such as these should be closed. But another question 
arises: what is to happen in this case to the people living in 
the towns, settlements, and villages along the mainline, where 
there is practically no other form of transportation? So we must 
think hard before making such a decision. 
  And a few more words about taxes. The regions which have 
acquired a certain amount of economic independence are setting 
rent, as an example, for the same land that is called "from the 
lantern." In Kurgan we are paying the local budget R50 per 
square meter, in Magnitogorsk we are paying R27, in Beloretsk 
(Bashkiria) R10, and in Samara just R1 for the same area. Tell 
me, please, is there any logic here? What basis are the local 
authorities using in setting the prices for land? 
  I will not dwell on the problems of passenger service, since 
my colleagues have already written about them sufficiently in 
GUDOK. I agree fully with their conclusions that losses cannot 
be covered just by raising the price of a ticket. This deprives 
us of competitiveness with other forms of transportation. I will 
stress once again: we need subsidies here both from the state 
(for long distances) and the local budgets--for suburban 
services. This is being done in all civilized countries, 
incidentally. 
  [Mikushin] And just how do we resolve the nonpayment 
problem? 
By waiting for appropriate government decisions and the granting 
of credits? 
  [Vorobyev] I have already stated. The minister does not have 
a bottomless pocket. We can and should earn for ourselves. As an 
example, this is the second year the railroad has been using the 
system of mutual credits, when a client settles accounts with us 
for transportation service with his products--metal scrap, 
lumber, machine tools, machinery, consumer goods, produce, and 
the like. We use some of these products for our own purposes, 
and some we sell at a profit for us through commercial 
structures. 
  Another way is by developing subsidiary and ancillary 
activity. Over the past 2 months we have received over an 
additional R8 billion through this activity alone. You will 
agree this is a substantial addition. So Kurgan built its own 
construction shop at the locomotive depot, where they are 
turning out reinforced concrete collars for shafts, which are in 
high demand. In the Zlatoust and Orsk divisions, subunits of 
civil construction services have put flow lines into operation 
to make a special beam used in building cottages and garden 
houses. There is heavy demand for this material, especially 
since the buildings made with it are resistant to cold and heat 
and are fireproof. 
  [Mikushin] Since we have mentioned construction, tell us how 
work in this area is proceeding on the railroad. 
  [Vorobyev] I will proudly note that we hold the leading 
position in this indicator among Russian railroads. It is 
sufficient to say that last year we commissioned about 150,000 
square meters of housing, which is substantially above the plan. 
The best results were achieved in the Kurgan, Chelyabinsk, and 
Orsk divisions. But housing construction in Orenburg has been 
cut back for several years, and the lines for apartments are 
increasing every year. I think the division managers are chiefly 
to blame for this. Now the question is: whether to cut back 
housing construction or to enlist railroad employees' personal 
funds for this. Unfortunately, there is no other way. 
  [Mikushin] Ivan Pavlovich, our railroad has suddenly become 
a 
border railroad. Has this had an effect on the transportation 
process? 
  [Vorobyev] Unquestionably it has. Six border crossings have 
already been established here, and each one has its own 
customhouse. Naturally, this has entailed changes in technology: 
additional structures are being established to receive freight 
and keep a record of railcar crossings. But the Petropavlovsk 
Division has turned out to be in another state's territory. 
Calculations are not made in rubles there, but Kazakh (tenge), 
which creates certain problems. Settlements are conducted at the 
existing exchange rate. We are trying to maintain businesslike, 
neighborly relations with Kazkhstan. I do not think it is in 
their or our interests to disrupt the operation of the Transsib 
and Turksib [branches of the Trans-Siberian Mainline]. 
  The same may be said about refrigerated shipments, whose 
volume has been reduced by more than 30 percent. Previously, 
many dozens of our refrigerated units were found on railroads in 
the Transcaucasus and Central Asia. Today they are being 
returned in large numbers to their point of registration--the 
Troitsk Depot. We want to preserve at least some of them. 
  [Mikushin] All the same, Ivan Pavlovich, will the railroad 
survive under such extraordinary conditions? 
  [Vorobyev] The conditions are really extraordinary. I will 
cite just one example. Prevously the Chelyabinsk Pipe Rolling 
Plant unloaded 350 railcars per day. Today it unloads only 60. 
We used to give the "Uraltrak" Association 200 empty cars every 
day. Now it uses only two cars. And the same situation exists at 
most enterprises in the Urals. Incomes are falling, of course. 
But we do not plan to cut back either production or social 
programs. And it becomes very annoying when the local 
authorities put spokes in our wheels even in such an extremely 
difficult situation. For example, a very zealous property 
management committee from Miass, where there is a combined motor 
vehicle and rail terminal, is suddenly putting it up for auction 
after deciding to sell it to private interests. Why have the 
people in Miass suddenly forgotten that the railroad built the 
terminal with its own resources and funds? 
  I direct our specialists' attention to the fact that they 
cannot remain idle in the situation today. They have to think 
about how and where to earn something additional and how to 
maintain high discipline on the railroad. Take the periods for 
paying wages, for example. The Kurgan and Petropavlovsk 
divisions are issuing money without delays, seeking every 
opportunity for this. But in Orsk, Zlatoust, and Kartaly, wage 
payments are being held up. 
  All the same, I look to the future with optimism. The 
recession cannot continue forever. I hope the government will 
finally find a way out of the crisis.

Users' Association"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  1. Status of the Association </H5>
  The voluntary public noncommercial organization is a legal 
person. 
<H5>  2. Goals of Activity: </H5>
  Rendering all-round assistance to members of the Association 
in increasing the efficiency of railroad transport and the 
transport service of basic production; 
  Increasing the information and competence of the directors 
and specialists of Association member enterprises, as well as 
citizens, on the problems of economic-legal regulation of 
railroad transport; 
  Drawing the attention of the Government, legislative power, 
the press and society to the problems of efficient interaction, 
with respect to transporting freight and passengers, between 
federal railroad transport and the users of its services; 
  Having the organs of legislative and executive authority 
pass 
acts, documents and statutes which take into consideration the 
legal rights and interests of freight consignors, consignees and 
passengers. Passing acts, documents and statutes which disregard 
these interests is impermissible. 
<H5>  3. Directions of Activity: </H5>
  The basic directions in the Association's activity are: 
  Developing relations of cooperation and mutual assistance 
between enterprises and member-citizens of the Association in 
the matter of increasing transport efficiency along railroads; 
  Setting up relationships of equal partnership and productive 
interaction between the enterprises and member-citizens of the 
Association, on the one hand, and enterprises and railroad 
transport bodies, on the other. 
  For successful achievement of tasks in these directions, the 
Association will: 
  Obtain, process and analyze legislative normative, 
scientific-technical, legal, economic and other information in 
the sphere of railroad transport in Russia and abroad, for 
subsequent dissemination among the members of the Association; 
  Draw up (by order of the Association members or in 
accordance 
with an initiative procedure) documents ensuring the effective 
defense, by enterprises and member-citizens of the Association, 
of their legal rights and interests; 
  Draw up (by order of the Association members or in 
accordance 
with an initiative procedure) economic recommendations for 
enterprises and member-citizens of the Association, directed 
toward increasing the efficiency of their interaction with 
railroad transport; 
  Publish, in the press and on radio and television, materials 
revealing the positions of Association members on various 
economic and legal problems, including drafts and legislative 
and normative acts on federal, regional and local conditions; 
  Defend, in government, economic, legal, law-and-order 
bodies, 
as well as bodies of local state power, the legislative rights 
and interests of enterprises and member-citizens of the 
Association in the sphere of railroad transport; 
  Prepare drafts of intersectorial agreements by sectors 
included in the Association, as well as agreements with federal 
railroad transport, on problems of interaction in various 
spheres of activity (tariffs, station development, repair of 
rolling stock and the tractive consist, joint reserving of 
throughput and traffic capacities, insurance for commercial 
risks, etc.). 
  In addition to those named, the Association can also engage 
in other activity that is not forbidden by law and normative 
documents regulating the activity of public organizations. 
<H5>  4. The Association's Methods of Work: </H5>
  Regular meetings and exchange of opinions with workers of 
the 
RF Government, ministries and departments and legislative 
bodies, with elucidation of the Association's position on 
specific problems (meetings, conferences, joint assemblies, 
seminars, symposiums, etc.); 
  Preparation and dissemination, in the press and on radio and 
television, of press-releases, statements, memorandums, etc.; 
  Holding briefings, press-conferences, and so forth, and 
carrying out measures; 
  Holding zonal and federal conferences of directors and 
specialists of the Association's enterprises and member-citizens; 
  Individual consultations and discussions by order of 
Association members; 
  Organization of territorial mutual support groups of 
enterprise-users of railroad transport of various sectors of 
industry (local associations); 
  Constant interaction between sectorial and transport 
scientific research institutes, design bureaus, and similar 
organizations, as well as worker collectives, and legislative 
and normative acts related to railroad transport problems; 
  Constant interaction with representatives of ministries 
(Economics, Justice, Transport, Railways), of the Highest Court 
of Arbitration, railroad administrations and other organs of 
authority and administration, in order to explain the 
Association's position and obtain the necessary information; 
  Constant interaction with parties and trade unions in order 
to work out joint positions on problems of interest to the 
Association; 
  The activity of the Association should be planned. 
<H5>  5. The Financial Basis of the Association: </H5>
  As a voluntary public organization, the Association should 
exist on the dues of its members and the aid of sponsors; 
  The pay for members of the Association who perform work at 
its order can be reckoned as dues to finance its activity; 
  Research and development done in the interests of 
Association 
members can be performed through the resources of an 
extra-budgetary fund to support sectorial and intersectorial 
research; 
  Measures making it possible to bring in income (conferences, 
seminars, consultations, etc.) should not stipulate 
profitability; 
  Through withholdings from the economic effect formed at the 
Association member-enterprises as the result of carrying out the 
measures prepared by it, funds can be formed to finance 
research, information, publishing and other types of activity 
specified by the Association's Charter. 
<H5>  6. Direction of the Association and Its Structure: </H5>
  Strategic direction of the Association and control over its 
activity is implemented by a Council, formed by the founders' 
conference from among the most prestigious specialists -- 
transport workers, lawyers, economists, journalists and 
political and public figures. 
  The following may enter the Council: 

  -  Enterprise 
directors 
  -  Bank directors 
  -  Sectorial stock exchange 
directors 
  -  Departmental directors (of Roskommetallurgiya, 
Roslesprom, Rosugol, etc.) 
  -  Local administrative 
directors 
  -  Representatives of political parties and public 
organizations 
  -  Trade Union representatives 
  -  Newspaper 
editors 
  An executive board of directors, headed by a 
General Director, carries out direct guidance of the 
Association's work. 
  Local territorial associations (branches), set up by 
agreement with Association members located on the given 
territory, should be the basic unit in the Association's 
structure. 
  The executive board of directors and local associations 
conclude time contracts with the specialists needed to perform 
the basic work (analysis and transmission of information, 
preparation of articles, etc., publications, drawing up 
documents and recommendations, etc.). 
  The executive board of directors and local associations have 
independent budgets, are legal persons and interact on the basis 
of contracts on joint action. 
  The Association can found independent structures (funds, 
scientific-information centers, specialized firms, etc.), which 
further an efficient solution to its basic problems, 
particularly through developing new rolling stock and improving 
that being produced, developing other technical devices for 
general use and also through repairing and rebuilding them, 
solving problems of safety and ecology in railroad transport, 
organizing a general system of accounting for expenditures and 
the movement of material resources, etc.

  [Text] 
<H5>  Annotation </H5>
  The author of this book--the assistant chief designer of the 
submarine ``Komsomolets''--offers his interpretation of the 
tragedy that played itself out in the Sea of Norway on 7 April 
1989. His opinion regarding the causes of the accident and 
demise of the submarine, which is based on documented testimony, 
contradicts the conclusions reached by the government commission. 
  This book is intended for a wide range of readers. 
  This book was published with the assistance of the 
Nuclear- Powered Submarine ``Komsomolets'' Memorial Charity. 
  Profit from the book's sale will be used to provide 
assistance to families of deceased submariners. 
<H5>  From the Author </H5>
  On 7 April 1989 an accident occurred aboard the Soviet 
nuclear- powered submarine ``Komsomolets'' in the Sea of Norway, 
as a result of which the submarine sank, and a large part of its 
crew tragically perished. 
  A government commission created to reveal the causes of the 
accident contained representatives both from the USSR Navy and 
from the Ministry of Ship Building Industry. 
  In the course of the commission's work, members of its 
working group from ship building industry who directly 
participated in the submarine's construction--chief delivery 
agent V. M. Chuvakin, delivery mechanic E. P. Leonov and 
assistant chief designer D. A. Romanov--arrived at a special 
opinion regarding the causes of the accident and the demise of 
the submarine that differed from the opinion of other members of 
the working group representing the navy. However, it was not 
reflected in the materials of the commission's working group. 
This compelled us to write a letter to the chairman of the 
government commission, CPSU Central Committee Secretary O. D. 
Baklanov, but even after this, the opinion of the naval 
engineers influenced the official conclusion of the government 
commission regarding the causes of the accident and demise of 
the submarine to only a most insignificant degree. 
  Appeals by the author of this book in the newspapers 
IZVESTIYA, KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, SOVETSKAYA 
ROSSIYA and SMENA and in the journal OGONEK regarding certain 
aspects of the tragedy turned out to be fruitless as well. 
  Thus the opinion of the workers of ship building industry 
regarding the causes of the tragedy of the submarine 
``Komsomolets'' never was brought to the awareness of the 
people, which is what compelled me to write this book. 
  The documentary narrative ``The Tragedy of the Submarine 
``Komsomolets'' '' cannot be considered to be the labor of a 
single author. Many specialists of ship building industry and 
the navy took part in the examination of the tragedy and the 
causes leading up to it, and in the analysis of the events and 
of the actions of the personnel in the fight for the ship's 
survival. The author analyzed the results of their work, and 
used them in the book. 
  The author is deeply grateful to Sevmashpredpriyatiye 
Production Association workers V. M. Chuvakin, E. P. Leonov and 
V. A. Vybornykh (the enterprise's assistant chief designer), and 
to designers and sector and division chiefs of the Rubin Central 
Design Office of Marine Engineering for their active support and 
invaluable assistance in writing this book. 
  The author is also grateful to his numerous opponents, whose 
arguments, often unobjective or incompetent, promoted a more 
careful examination of all aspects of the tragedy, and made it 
possible to confirm the conclusions presented here for the 
judgment of readers.

<H5>  Foreword </H5>
  This work by marine engineer and submarine designer D. A. 
Romanov is devoted to a tragic event in the history of the 
Soviet Navy--the disaster that occurred on 7 April 1989 in the 
Sea of Norway with the deep-sea nuclear-powered submarine 
``Komsomolets''. 
  From the first days the author was actively involved in 
designing, building and commissioning the submarine 
``Komsomolets'', and he participated personally in the most 
critical trials and practical tests of the specific 
possibilities of the unique ship as a whole, and of the 
technical concepts embodied in its design. 
  A deep knowledge of all of the circumstances of the tragedy 
and a high level of technical erudition combined with honesty 
and principles led the author to his own opinion regarding the 
causes of the accident aboard the submarine ``Komsomolets'' and 
the subsequent demise of it and its crew of 42. 
  In the book offered here to the reader, D. A. Romanov 
persuasively demonstrates that the main cause of the tragedy in 
the Sea of Norway was something other than technical 
imperfections in the ship's design or insufficient reliability 
of the equipment installed aboard the ship--in this regard the 
submarine ``Komsomolets'' differed favorably from most Soviet 
submarines. 
  The incompetency of higher officials of the navy in matters 
regarding crew training and personnel work, poor development of 
the navy's infrastructure, and stagnation and irresponsibility 
in the leading directorates of the navy are the main causes of 
the navy's high accident rate. This is precisely the cause which 
led to the fact that Captain 1st Rank Ye. A. Vanin's poorly 
trained crew was sent off on that fateful cruise aboard the 
ill-prepared submarine ``Komsomolets''. 
  The refusal to recognize this fact does nothing for the 
honor 
of the naval leadership. Rejecting the obvious and protecting 
``the honor of the uniform,'' the naval leadership is not 
taking any steps to fundamentally reorganize naval service. 
  The designer's truthful and honest narrative will be useful 
both to specialists in ship building industry and to naval 
personnel in service afloat of all ranks. 
  Hero of the Soviet Union, Vice Admiral (Reserve) Ye. D. 
Chernov 
<H5>  What Is This Book About? </H5>
  Different hypotheses regarding the causes of the tragedy of 
the Soviet nuclear-powered submarine ``Komsomolets'' have been 
stated in numerous articles published in a number of newspapers 
and journals by representatives of the navy. Their essence 
reduces to the following: 
A. a fire occurred as the result of an electrical equipment 
fault; 
B. the temporal proximity of the fire and leakage of air 
systems predetermined the high intensity and swiftness of the 
fire's development, and rendered fire extinguishing resources 
ineffective. 
  What in the opinion of naval representatives helped the 
accident to come about? Let's listen to the opinion of workers 
of the Main Naval Staff: ``As far as causes bringing about the 
accident are concerned, numerous technical imperfections in the 
submarine's various systems should be named first. Their 
presence may be attributed entirely to things left undone by the 
designers and ship builders, and to the impermissible liberalism 
displayed during the ship's acceptance trials.''[.sup]1[/] 
  And he concluded: ``Despite the self-sacrificing and 
technically competent actions by the personnel, it was 
impossible to save the submarine.'' 
  And any critical remarks regarding the actions of the 
personnel and their occupational training were met ``with 
bayonets'' by the navy's ``royal host,'' which was not averse to 
falsifications and obvious slander. 
  Soviet and foreign experience in designing new models of 
military equipment shows that there is no such thing as 
absolutely safe equipment, and unfortunately its operation is 
always associated with the probability of accidents, 
unpredictable in many cases. Throughout all time, military 
equipment was created on the basis of the latest scientific and 
technical accomplishments, and naturally it unavoidably fell 
within the zone of maximum technical risk. Nuclear-powered 
attack submarines are the most complex, potentially dangerous 
and vulnerable objects in this respect. The especially high fire 
danger they present is a consequence of the high levels of power 
flowing through the compartments, the proximity of combustible 
materials and working media to equipment presenting a fire 
danger, imperfections in resources monitoring conditions in the 
compartments, and the limited possibilities of available fire 
extinguishing resources. 
  At the same time we cannot agree with N. Cherkashin's 
assertion[.sup]2[/] that the fire and explosion danger of 
submarines corresponds to locating a powder magazine in a 
gasoline storage area, and that submariners live in an 
environment in which death awaits them at any second. There is 
no need for extremes either in embellishing the life of 
submariners or in inflating the horror. Service aboard 
submarines is harsh and difficult even without these horrors. 
And no break areas, swimming pools, canaries and artificial 
grass can do anything to make it significantly easier. 
  Designers creating and testing submarines are constantly 
concerned with improving the equipment, raising its reliability 
and reducing the degree of technical risk, but it is impossible 
to totally exclude the probability of accidents. Under these 
conditions the theoretical training and practical skills of 
every crewmember--that is, the professionalism of the people 
operating the complex and potentially dangerous equipment--have 
always had the decisive role, and will continue to do so. It is 
the professionalism of the crew that actually influences the 
situation and events in a submarine's compartments before and 
during an accident, prevents or, in the opposite case, promotes 
the advent and development of an accident situation, and 
determines the effectiveness of the personnel's actions in 
recovering from the accident. Captain 2d Rank (Reserve) V. V. 
Stefanovskiy, the former chief engineer of a naval ship repair 
plant, and currently the senior watchman of a gardening 
cooperative, was right a thousand times over when he said: 
``Competent seamen can deal with an accident. Responsible seamen 
won't let one happen.''[.sup]3[/] For this truthfulness, 
Vladimir Vladimirovich did have to make a career change. 
  The submarine ``Komsomolets'' did not differ in any way from 
modern submarines currently in operation in terms of the 
composition of combat and technical resources, including its 
control systems and its damage control systems. It was accepted 
in 1983, and in August 1984 it was commissioned. 
  ``After its commissioning, the submarine underwent 
experimental operation for several years. The reliability of the 
design concepts and the correspondence of operating 
characteristics to calculated parameters were checked out during 
this period. The trials were carried out intensively in the most 
varied navigation conditions, including in totally 
self-contained navigation. As with any other trials, certain 
problems did occur, but not a single serious breakdown ever 
occurred. The submarine crews gave a high evaluation to its 
operating properties on the basis of their navigation 
experience.''[.sup]4[/] 
  We should add to this that all of the trials, as well as 
experimental operation and subsequent patrol duty, were carried 
out by the first crew under the command of Captain 1st Rank Yu. 
A. Zelenskiy, with the participation of a group of specialists 
from the USSR Ministry of Ship Building Industry in the stage of 
experimental operation. In 1988 the submarine was recognized as 
an outstanding submarine, and it was awarded the name 
``Komsomolets''. Captain 1st Rank Ye. A. Vanin's crew was the 
second crew of this submarine, and the cruise that began on 28 
February 1989 and ended in the tragedy of 7 April was its first 
independent cruise. 
  While giving credit to the heroism and bravery of the 
crewmembers, we need to objectively evaluate their actions 
during the accident, so as not to allow repetition of such cases 
in the future due to wrong and biased conclusions based only on 
real and imaginary imperfections of a submarine. In this case I 
cannot but agree with Vice Admiral Ye. D. Chernov's 
opinion[.sup]5[/] that any distortion or toning down of 
information, even out of the most humane motives, is immoral in 
relation to submariners serving patrol duty.

  [Text] We will also examine the 
``numerous technical imperfections'' supposedly present in this 
submarine, which in the opinion of the naval leadership helped 
to bring about the accident. 
  And we will describe measures being undertaken to raise the 
reliability of submarines currently in operation. 
<H5>  The Crew </H5>
  According to the detail design, the submarine 
``Komsomolets'' 
should have been serviced by highly qualified specialists from 
among officers and warrant officer technicians. 
  According to the manning table approved in 1982 by the 
General Staff of the USSR Ministry of Defense, the submarine's 
crew was 57 persons (29 officers with rank not below senior 
lieutenant, 26 warrant officer technicians and two 
compulsory-service petty officers). In this case the engineering 
department (BCh-5) should have consisted of 10 officers and 10 
warrant officer technicians. 
  But later on the crew was increased to 64 persons without 
industry's consent, and warrant officer technicians were 
replaced by compulsory-service seamen, supposedly in connection 
with difficulties in manning crews with warrant officers, and 
for the purposes of economizing resources. However, this 
automatically reduced the crew's potential in terms of its 
combat and occupational training. This change in the crew's 
qualitative composition had an especially great effect on the 
damage control and electrical engineering divisions of 
BCh-5--the principal subunits fighting for the ship's survival. 
Thus while in the former the total manning was increased by two 
seamen, one warrant officer technician of three was replaced by 
a compulsory-service seaman, and in the electrical engineering 
division, while the manning was kept the same, two of four 
warrant officer technicians were once again substituted by 
compulsory-service seamen. 
  This reduction of professional level, ``planned'' by the 
navy's elite, affected not only the crew of the submarine 
``Komsomolets'' but also all other submarines. Note that this 
``rationalization'' by the naval leadership was not reflected or 
evaluated in the materials of the government commission. It 
would have been naive to expect this, since the ``Combat 
Training'' section of the working group of the government 
commission, which addressed this issue, consisted entirely of 
fleet representatives who were to one degree or another 
accessory to such stupid bungling, bordering on the criminal. 
  Great was the price paid by the country for such 
``economy''! 
For some reason it was not until after the demise of the 
submarine ``Komsomolets'' that the Main Naval Staff came to 
understand that ``the crews of ships of this type should be 
manned only by officers and warrant officers, because 
compulsory-service seamen and petty officers lack the means to 
adequately master operation of a submarine in such a short 
time.''[.sup]6[/] 
  A slight digression: Questions that had not been clarified 
to 
one degree or another by the working group of the government 
commission will be broached subsequently here on several 
occasions. And not because they couldn't be clarified. They were 
not clarified due to active opposition by naval representatives, 
who made up the absolute majority of the commission. 
  In what matter were the circumstances of the submarine 
accident investigated? The members of the government commission 
subjected 16 members of the crew that participated in the cruise 
to only an initial interrogation. In this case most of the 
members of the working group were present, but for practical 
purposes they did not take part in the interrogation. And only 
once did they (a narrow circle persons from the working group) 
visit the hospital for a short time to officially interrogate 
crew members. Unofficially, however, behind the backs of the 
members of the working group representing industry, fleet 
representatives visited the hospital several times, where they 
talked with the crew and exerted certain pressures upon it. This 
is why the explanatory reports of some of the crew members 
differ considerably from what these people had said to members 
of the government commission. ``The survivors talked a great 
deal in the beginning, but then they bit their 
tongues....''[.sup]7[/] 
  And it is absolutely clear that Captain 1st Rank S. I. 
Bystrov was totally inconsistent with reality when he asserted: 
``...surviving ``Komsomolets'' crew members were questioned in a 
fault finding manner by the State Commission, which also 
contains representatives of industry. All unanimously marked the 
high level of special knowledge of the 
submariners.''[.sup]8[/] 
  The working group has a tape recording of the interrogation 
of submarine personnel by members of the government commission, 
the explanatory reports of the surviving members of the crew, 
extracts from the ship's log and extracts from the control log 
of the main propulsion unit. Interrogation of personnel during 
visits to the hospital was not documented. 
  From the very beginning, naval representatives did 
everything 
to prove that the submarine was prepared well for the cruise, 
that the personnel were excellently trained, and that the 
actions of the ship's attack center and the leadership of the 
Northern Fleet were the right ones, and if the submarine sank 
and the greater part of the crew perished, this was at the fault 
of the designer and industrial workers. 
  An extensive campaign to publicize the ``competent'' actions 
of the crew, begun in the press under the leadership of the 
fleet command long before the initial conclusions were reached 
by the government commission, was also directed at concealing 
serious shortcomings associated with manning and training the 
crews, with servicing the submarine and with solving social 
problems. It had nothing in common with real concern for people, 
with the objective of raising the fleet's combat readiness. 
  The administration of the CPSU Central Committee also voiced 
its opinion. A news brief appeared in the 13 May 1989 edition of 
PRAVDA regarding decoration of the crew of the submarine 
``Komsomolets''. The assessment of the crew's professional 
actions had already been made: ``In a critical situation the 
crew acted with maximum bravery and technical competency, 
fighting to save the ship and render it safe.'' Thus the 
administration of the CPSU Central Committee confirmed and 
approved the actions taken by the naval leadership to conceal 
the true causes of the accident. These same ends were also 
pursued by the government commission. 
  But let's return to Captain 1st Rank Ye. A. Vanin's crew. It 
was formed in June 1984. It had underwent combat training, 
passed all of the tests and was brought out to the first 
line[.sup]9[/]by September 1987. Under a point scoring 
system, the crew was fourth in the division, and it had not 
participated in a single independent combat patrol. The 
assertion that this was ``one of the strongest crews one could 
imagine''[.sup]10[/] was quite significantly exaggerated. In 
1988 the crew underwent retraining at the training center, and 
in September it was certified with an unsatisfactory score in 
ship damage control (a letter from submarine commanders of the 
Northern Fleet's First Flotilla sent in August 1989 to CPSU 
Central Committee Secretary O. D. Baklanov). According to my 
information the average score received by the crew in work on 
damage control problems was only 2.7 on a five-point scale. But 
none of this is contained in materials of the ``Combat 
Training'' section of the government commission's working group, 
which consisted of naval representatives only. This fact appears 
in distorted form in N. Cherkashin's articles[.sup]11[/] as: 
``And in the training center where both of the crews had been 
``perfected,'' they hastened to write an unfavorable performance 
report on Vanin, the deceased commander of the ``Komsomolets'', 
second-guessing the usual course of thinking of the supreme 
leadership: ``criminal negligence''.'' 
  In the letter mentioned above from the submarine commanders, 
it is asserted that the crew had corrected the shortcomings 
revealed in work on damage control problems, and completed them 
with a good grade. But knowing the make-up of the command of the 
division to which the submarine ``Komsomolets'' belonged, I dare 
to assert that none of the division's flag-officer specialists 
were well enough versed in the material of this submarine to 
rule adequately on performance in damage control problems. 
  In early January 1989 a conflict occurred in the crew during 
the submarine's preparation for patrol duty. It involved the 
crew's work on ship damage control problems, it was examined at 
an emergency party meeting,[.sup]12[/] and it ended in the 
hospital for Captain 3d Rank A. S. Ternovskiy, the submarine 
deputy commander for political affairs. ``It so happened that 
the crew of the ``Komsomolets'' would not accept the former 
deputy commander for political affairs, and did not wish to go 
out to sea with him'' is how N. Cherkashin explains this 
event.[.sup]13[/] 
  Let's return to the act drawn up by the ``Crew Political 
Morale'' section of the government commission's working group: 
``Captain 3d Rank Yu. I. Maksimchuk was transferred to crew 604 
on temporary duty for the time of patrol duty on 16 January 1989 
in place of the regular political worker, Captain 3d Rank A. S. 
Ternovskiy. Captain 3d Rank A. S. Ternovskiy was not allowed to 
serve patrol duty for health reasons. Prior to patrol duty he 
visited the hospital twice for treatment from 12 January to 27 
January 1989 with a diagnosis of a ``neurological condition, not 
sharply pronounced, situationally predicated'' and from 16 
February to 28 February 1989 with a diagnosis of ``an asthenic 
state, moderately expressed''.'' 
  The places of the cause and effect were deliberately changed 
here. The deputy commander for political affairs wound up in the 
hospital as a result of a conflict and his suspension from 
patrol duty, and not vice versa, as the section of the working 
group indicated above tried to portray this. One need not be a 
great expert in medicine to understand that this ``cause'' of 
Ternovskiy's replacement was clearly fabricated. The members of 
the section also understood this--that could be the only 
explanation for the following supplement to the act: ``In 
resolving the matter of suspending (Now he's suspended, although 
previously it was said that he was disallowed--D. R.) of Captain 
3d Rank Ternovskiy from patrol duty, it was also considered that 
he was unable to carry out his duties in full volume.'' So what 
was the reason for Ternovskiy's suspension? Illness, or his 
``inability to carry out his duties in full volume''? The 
section members never did get around to attentively analyzing 
this conflict, and they didn't talk with deputy commander for 
political affairs Ternovskiy. Obviously they only tried to show 
that there are no shortcomings in the work of the navy's 
political organs, and that there couldn't be any. But this 
brings up the following question: Would the tragedy have 
occurred if the division's political organs had objectively 
dealt with the conflict? 
  And so, by the beginning of the cruise, the crew consisted 
of 
64 persons: 30 officers, 22 warrant officers, and 12 compulsory- 
service petty officers and seamen. In this case eight of the 
officers were lieutenants--that is, 25 percent of the officers 
had served aboard a submarine for about a year after graduating 
from school, and their rank (and consequently their level of 
occupational training) did not correspond to the approved table. 
It should also be noted that damage control division commander 
Captain 3d Rank V. A. Yudin possessed the specialty of a turbine 
engineer--in no way corresponding to the position he 
occupied--and served in this position for only about a year, 
while the division's second officer was a lieutenant and also 
lacked sufficient experience. Moreover one of the two warrant 
officers in the division (Warrant Officer Yu. P. Podgornov) was 
unable to pass the tests, and he was not certified for 
independent control, while two of the three seamen were in their 
first year of naval service. 
  It is clear from this that prior to the ship's departure for 
sea, the crew lacked a damage control division as a full-fledged 
combat unit. And thus the requirements of the ``Manual of 
Submarine Damage Control'' (RBZh-PL-82) were violated. 
  RBZh-PL-82, Article 173: ``Departure for sea is 
prohibited...when a full complement of trained personnel is 
lacking.'' 
  The fact that the requirements of the ``Manual'' were 
violated was not reflected in the materials of the government 
commission. 
  Due to objective causes the submarine crew could not have 
possessed high professional skill and experience in operating 
the material, which ultimately affected the outcome of the 
crew's fight for the submarine's survival. And this was not so 
much the fault as the misfortune of the crew. 
  How are submarine crews trained in training centers? The 
quality of the training is extremely unsatisfactory, because it 
is carried out sporadically, with emphasis on theory, without 
relevance to a particular submarine, especially when it comes to 
carrying out general damage control exercises aboard ship. And 
the centers are poorly supplied even with trainers and training 
displays. 
  The navy also lacks a system of occupational selection of 
submarine crewmembers on the basis of psychological stability in 
extreme situations. ``We aren't cosmonauts,'' one highly placed 
official from the navy told me. Does he really feel that a 
combat patrol by a submarine under fully self-contained 
conditions is any less complex and dangerous a mission than a 
flight into space? 
  Submarine crews are perpetually diverted from combat 
training 
for garrison duty, for housekeeping work and for other 
incidental duties, and this occurs both during construction and 
testing of a submarine and during patrol duty. 
  Training complexes are absent from the permanent stations of 
submarines. And because submarines are provided an 
unsatisfactory supply of electric power and working power 
production units, it is impossible to organize high quality crew 
training aboard the submarine itself. 
  The prestige of serving aboard nuclear-powered submarines 
dropped dramatically in the last two decades because such 
service involved continual relocations, absence of housing, the 
unsettled daily life of the families of submariners, and the 
difficulty of the work itself. Nor are there any prospects for 
providing housing to them upon completion of service. The 
possibility for promotions in rank (and consequently pay raises) 
are limited when a submariner serves permanently in a single 
position. All of this results in high turnover of seagoing 
personnel and limits the possibilities for growth of 
professionalism. The second crews of submarines, which are 
deprived of the possibility for learning from the experience of 
qualified industrial specialists, and upon whom all of the 
listed factors act to a significantly greater degree, find 
themselves in an especially complex situation. Consequently it 
is no accident that most of the worst accidents aboard 
submarines happen with the second crews. 
<H5>  Preparations for the Cruise </H5>
  Routine inspection and maintenance and work to correct 
existing faults were carried out prior to the cruise of the 
submarine ``Komsomolets'' in accordance with regulations. 
Considering the complexity and laboriousness of this work, 
according to the technical design documents it should have been 
carried out by a special technical crew with the help of highly 
qualified specialists from the navy's ship repair plants. The 
trial run of the submarine ``Komsomolets'' demonstrated the need 
for creating such a crew. But one was not created. 
  In order that the full volume of routine maintenance and 
inspection could be carried out within the established time 
aboard a ``Komsomolets'' class submarine, not less than 200-250 
highly qualified specialists must be brought in. The navy's 
repair bases do not have such a large number of specialists, and 
they do not participate in routine maintenance and inspection. 
The entire burden of this work is laid upon the submarine crews. 
  ``A ship's officer is responsible for the good working 
condition of his materiel, and must do everything to restore it 
in the event of breakdown,'' declared naval commander-in-chief 
V. N. Chernavin, obviously feeling that there are no problems in 
repairs and routine maintenance and inspection in the 
fleet.[.sup]14[/] 
  But in reality submarine crews are physically unable to 
carry 
out the full volume of routine maintenance and inspection with 
acceptable quality within the 40 days allowed to them. 
Consequently they are forced to compromise with their conscience 
and carry out routine maintenance and inspection basically only 
on equipment that failed or was placed on report during the last 
cruise. The submarine fleet has even evolved a system of 
``failure to failure'' equipment operation. Unsatisfactory 
maintenance of material, and late and poor quality maintenance 
and inspection, resulting from the absence of specially trained, 
highly qualified technical crews and from imperfections in the 
navy's repair service, are noted aboard all submarines of the 
navy, especially after expiration of the warranty period. 
  The supply of electric power and power generators of 
acceptable quality is unsatisfactorily organized at naval bases, 
as a result of which submarines standing at bases must expend 
the life of ship equipment (to avoid malfunction of electronic 
equipment). 
  A system for documenting and certifying completion of 
routine 
maintenance and inspection is absent from the navy, and 
therefore it is practically impossible to check the completeness 
and quality of such work. 
  Everything said here is completely valid in relation to the 
submarine ``Komsomolets'' as well. Moreover the difficulties of 
routine maintenance and inspection aboard this submarine were 
aggravated by the absence of a set of documents concerning 
refits between cruises. An order of the Main Naval Command 
placed the responsibility of drafting these documents on a 
specialized naval enterprise, but the order was not carried out. 
  None of these issues were reflected in the materials of the 
government commission, which is fully natural at least because 
Vice Admiral V. V. Zaytsev, who as the chief of the navy's Main 
Directorate for Operation and Repair was responsible for the 
unsatisfactory equipment of submarine bases and the quality of 
repairs and routine maintenance and inspection, was appointed 
chairman of the ``Operation and Damage Control'' section of this 
commission's working group. 
  Being aware that the situation concerning routine 
maintenance 
and inspection and repairs by navy personnel was so unfavorable, 
the workers of ship building industry suggested in their letter, 
cited above, to CPSU Central Committee Secretary O. D. Baklanov, 
that the industry's companies should service submarines over the 
course of their entire life. This proposal was shamelessly 
distorted in the 8 August 1989 edition of KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, in 
which the need for company service was explained by the low 
quality of submarine construction. 
  But let's return to the submarine ``Komsomolets''. As is 
confirmed in the joint act of two sections of the government 
commission's working group, ``Operation and Damage Control'' and 
``Ship Building,'' the ``Komsomolets''set out to sea for patrol 
duty in serviceable condition. 
  To what extent does this assertion correspond to reality? 
The 
work order for refitting of the submarine ``Komsomolets'' 
between cruises, which was signed off by division commander Rear 
Admiral O. T. Shkiryatov and approved by flotilla deputy 
commander Rear Admiral L. B. Nikitin, foresaw repair of 
television system equipment (one of the television cameras of 
this system was in compartment 7 of the submarine) and the 
oxygen gas analyzer for compartment 7 (items 7 and 71 of the 
work order). No documents attesting to completion of these 
repairs were presented. According to a statement by naval 
representatives the repairs were carried out by floating ship 
repair dry dock No 7, but they were unable to say who carried 
them out, and who accepted the equipment after repairs. Let's 
turn to the joint act of the two sections, mentioned above: 
``The sensor of the MN-5134 automatic oxygen gas analyzer of 
compartment 7 failed on the 10th day of the cruise,'' and ``The 
television system failed during the navigation period prior to 
the submarine's accident.'' 
  What is this, a chance occurrence or a definite pattern? 
There are full grounds for suggesting that the submarine set out 
on its cruise with a faulty gas analyzer and a faulty television 
system. In any case no measures were undertaken to clarify the 
circumstances associated with repair of this equipment. Neither 
the section chairman, Vice Admiral V. V. Zaytsev, nor members of 
the section representing the navy's Main Directorate for 
Operation and Repair were interested in clarifying this, because 
all of the shortcomings in the organization of ship repair, for 
which these people were personally responsible, would be 
revealed. 
  And this was apparently not the only equipment that was 
faulty prior to the cruise. During the work of the government 
commission in the city of Severomorsk, at my request Captain 1st 
Rank M. V. Petrovskiy, chief mechanical engineer of the Northern 
Fleet, telephoned the hospital and asked Lieutenant A. V. 
Zaytsev by specifically what means (batch [portsionnyy] or 
emergency) the end groups of ballast tanks were blown. 
Lieutenant Zaytsev replied that emergency blowing was carried 
out, because the batch blowing system was ``not in operation.'' 
It follows from this reply that the submarine went to sea with a 
faulty system of batch blowing of ballast tanks. 
  An examination of the submarine ``Komsomolets'' with 
deep-sea 
submersibles in August-September 1991 revealed that it lacked an 
aft outboard television camera. Review of video tape showing the 
location at which this camera is secured permits a categorical 
conclusion--the television camera had been removed from the 
submarine at the base, prior to its cruise. Such are the facts. 
  RBZh-PL-82, Article 173: ``Departure for sea is 
prohibited...in the presence of faults in the hull, technical 
equipment or rescue devices.'' 
  It is difficult to say how much a working television system 
could have helped the submarine's attack center to correctly 
estimate the situation in compartment 7 and adopt the necessary 
damage control decisions, but one thing is clear--there is no 
doubt that its breakdown played a negative role. As far as the 
oxygen gas analyzer is concerned, its role in creating the 
accident situation in compartment 7 will be discussed later. 
  Prior to the patrol the ``Komsomolets'' took aboard stores 
of 
provisions, bed linens, underwear, warm clothing and other gear 
and supplies for 69 persons intended for full self-sufficiency; 
in this case part of these provisions and supplies (including 
bread) were stored in compartment 7, even though their storage 
here is not foreseen by the design documents. And despite this, 
the government commission's working group failed to establish 
either the assortment or the quantity of provisions and gear in 
compartment 7. The joint act of the two sections simply states: 
``The following may be noted among conditions contributing to 
fire in compartment 7: ...presence of 500 kg of bread, for which 
alcohol is used as a preservative, during the cruise in 
compartment 7.'' We should add to this that in the initial stage 
of the commission's work the figure was 1,000 kilograms of 
bread. But by calculation, there should have been not less than 
2,000 kilograms of bread in compartment 7 at the moment of the 
accident. 
  It was revealed during investigation of the accident's 
circumstances that in accordance with a decision of the 
corresponding higher ``father-commanders,'' chocolate in the 
emergency rations was substituted by sugar. It was unpleasant to 
listen to the childish prattle of admirals attempting to justify 
this outrage by a chocolate shortage. It is true that our 
country is living through hard times. But there is no shortage 
of this kind, and there cannot be one, when the discussion turns 
to submariners, and all the more so to emergency rations for 
them. But the shortage of conscience and responsibility revealed 
itself fully. It is shameful to write about this, but I 
must--otherwise next time the ``geniuses'' in the navy will put 
sugar coupons in the emergency ration instead of chocolate, and 
will then justify this by the long lines at the stores. 
  Such was the ``readiness'' of the submarine ``Komsomolets'' 
for the difficult cruise. 
<H5>  The Cruise </H5>
  And so, on 28 February 1989 the submarine ``Komsomolets'' 
set 
off on its cruise. 
  On 8 August 1988 the naval command and the USSR Ministry of 
Ship Building Industry adopted a joint decision to use the 
``Komsomolets'' purposefully, in a special scientific research 
program. This program was developed and forwarded to the 
Northern Fleet and to the naval leadership for coordination and 
approval. But to satisfy its own internal plans the command of 
the Northern Fleet tasked the submarine for ordinary patrol 
duty, which could have been carried out by any of dozens of 
other submarines in the fleet. Thus highly scientific research, 
including research of a defensive nature, was interrupted in 
this way. When this question was brought up at a meeting of the 
government commission with the press on 28 December 1989, 
division deputy commander Captain 1st Rank B. G. Kolyada 
suddenly announced some sort of ``second program of all kinds of 
tests'' supposedly being carried out by the fleet since August 
1988.[.sup]15[/] Vice Admiral V. V. Zaytsev, the chief of the 
Naval Main Directorate for Operation and Repair, had something 
somewhat different to say about this in his conclusion to the 
``Analysis of the Personnel's Damage Control Actions Aboard the 
Submarine ``Komsomolets'', '' carried out by a group of 
specialists from the Naval Academy imeni N. G. Kuznetsov under 
the leadership of Vice Admiral Ye. D. Chernov: ''...the mission 
posed for this patrol duty (That is, the submarine's last 
cruise.--D.R.) was to carry out scientific research together 
with hydrographic research vessels from 14 April to the end of 
May 1989.'' In confirming this, Captain 1st Rank Kolyada and 
Vice Admiral Zaytsev apparently forgot, and perhaps did not even 
know, that official documents exist saying the reverse. 
Northern Fleet chief of staff Vice Admiral Yu. N. Patrushev 
communicated in letter No. 47/0220 dated 17 February 1989 that 
the scientific research program ``cannot be carried out in 1989 
because the plan for utilization of ships in 1989 approved by 
the naval commander-in-chief did not foresee use of the 
submarine ``Komsomolets'' in a special program.'' Chief of the 
Main Naval Staff Fleet Admiral K. V. Makarov confirmed the 
decision of the command of the Northern Fleet to carry out 
scientific research beginning in 1990 in his directive No. 
725/559/KP dated 7 March 1989. Such are the myths and realities 
regarding the goals of the last cruise of the submarine 
``Komsomolets''. 
  According to division deputy commander Kolyada, during the 
cruise there had been no remarks regarding the condition of the 
materiel, with the exception of one breakdown of the rudder 
control system (the fuse burned out). This fault was quickly 
corrected. In addition the television system broke down on the 
13th-14th days of the cruise, and never was fixed. Crew members 
said nothing during their interrogation by the government 
commission about the fact and time of breakdown of the oxygen 
gas analyzer in compartment 7. This was revealed only during a 
visit to the hospital, but the date of its breakdown never was 
ascertained. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-003LC-08A>           The Submarine ``Komsomolets'' on Patrol </FIG>




  [Text] Seven April 1989 rolled around. 
The submarine was traveling at a depth of 386 meters at a speed 
of 8 knots, if we are to believe the ship's log, while if we 
believe what was said by division deputy commander B. G. Kolyada 
and remote control division commander Captain Lieutenant I. S. 
Orlov when they were interrogated by the government commission, 
at a speed of 6 knots. According to entries in the ship's log 
the compartments were inspected at 1100, and no remarks were 
entered. 
  In accordance with the Ship Regulations and RBZh-PL-82, 
compartments must be inspected during a cruise every half-hour, 
and the inspection results must be entered in the ship's log in 
the control room. 
  RBZh-PL-82, Article 183: ``During inspection of 
compartments the correspondence of the condition of the hull, 
weapons and technical resources to requirements of the 
guidelines must be meticulously verified, and the presence or 
absence of signs of emergency situations and conditions for them 
must be verified.'' 
  Watch duty is actually lax aboard many submarines, 
compartments and equipment are not inspected, and compartment 
and inspection reports are made only as a formality. The 
submarine command is fighting this attitude toward duty, but 
without results as yet. I am not going to assert that this was 
the way things were in Captain 1st Rank Ye. A. Vanin's crew 
also, but this cannot be excluded. 
  I can already hear the disdain of defenders of ``clean 
uniforms'' and the accusations of slander against the navy and 
of other mortal sins. This whole set of standard accusations has 
been voiced many, many times in our press. But I have something 
to respond with to this. 
  A so-called ``Compartment Readiness Command and Information 
System'' (KISGO) is installed in submarines built in recent 
years. In addition to other things, this system contains the 
following equipment: Buttons are installed in different places 
in each compartment. The number of buttons in a compartment is 
selected depending on the size of the compartments, and in order 
to ensure that the entire space of a compartment is covered by 
these buttons. The compartment inspection report is accepted by 
the watch mechanic only if the compartment watchstander first 
presses all of the buttons in succession. It is assumed that as 
he successively presses the buttons, the compartment 
watchstander will look around and thus ``carry out inspection of 
the compartment.'' That's how far our glorious navy has gone! 
  The submariners know this, and the command knows it, they 
know it, and are quiet about it, which is no less shameful than 
this fact itself. 
  Consequently it's not to them that I make my appeal. I am 
appealing to the mothers and fathers, to the wives and children, 
to the sisters and brothers of submariners. Ask your sons, 
husbands, fathers and brothers how they managed to get to a 
point in their lives where submarine designers are compelled to 
create an ``electronic cattle prod'' to force the submariner to 
do something upon which his life and the welfare of his 
relatives and family depend. 
<H5>  Fire! </H5>
  And so, an inspection of the compartments was conducted at 
1100. 
  From the ship's log: ``1100--rudder 5 port. 
Course-- 222. Compartments inspected. No remarks. Oxygen 
concentration 0.2 percent. Battery ventilation system in 
'hydrogen combustion' mode. Vacuum equals 35 mm 
H[.sup]2[/]0.'' 
  And suddenly: 
  ``1103. Course--222. Deliver LOKh to compartment 
7!''[.sup]16[/] 
  What happened within these 3 minutes of ship's log time? How 
do they correlate with real events and temporal parameters? 
  I have before me the ``Extract From the Draft Ship's Log of 
the Nuclear-Powered Submarine ``Komsomolets'' '' authenticated 
by the Northern Fleet chief of staff Vice Admiral Yu. N. 
Patrushev. The first conclusion: Two types of ship's logs exist 
in the fleet-- draft and final. The successes of ship crews in 
combat and political training are evaluated on the basis of the 
final copy, while the draft copy reflects the actual level of 
these successes. This double ``bookkeeping'' does nothing to 
improve the discipline of the crew during watch duty, it doesn't 
nurture the personnel's ability to maintain the ship's log with 
the needed completeness and quality, and it doesn't raise the 
sense of responsibility of command personnel for their 
decisions. On the contrary it creates good soil for slovenliness 
and falsification. 
  So what are we told by the entries in the ship's log for 7 
April 1989 from midnight to the time when the command ``Deliver 
LOKh to compartment 7!'' resounded like a shot? There are no 
entries in the ship's log for compartment inspections at 0800 
and 1000. Signatures attesting to relief of the second watch 
section from watch and assumption of the watch by the third 
watch section are absent. The lack of information regarding the 
submarine's operation was already discussed. There are no 
entries in the control log for the main propulsion unit 
regarding the shaft RPM at the moment of the watch's relief at 
0800. 
  All of this gives no indication of a high level of 
professional training and work discipline in Captain 1st Rank 
Ye. A. Vanin's crew. 
  A system automatically documenting commands from the attack 
center and messages from the duty stations would have been a 
great help in clarifying the circumstances of the first minutes 
of the accident. Such a system is present aboard submarines, 
although it is very imperfect. There was one aboard the 
``Komsomolets'' as well. However, as a rule submarine crews do 
not make a practice of using this system in their day-to-day 
activities, and they do not use it at times of accidents. 
  So at what time was compartment 7 actually inspected, and 
was 
there a report of its inspection? It does not seem possible to 
answer this question categorically. During the interrogation by 
the government commission Captain Lieutenant S. A. Dvorov and 
Lieutenant K. A. Fedotko said that they had personally heard a 
report from the watchstander for compartment 7, Senior Seaman N. 
O. Bukhnikashvili, regarding inspection of the compartment, and 
they cite a time of 1058 and ``around 5 minutes before all of it 
began.'' Lieutenant A. V. Tretyakov believes that the report was 
at 1100. But all of this information is made doubtful by the 
following responses from the senior watch officer, Captain 
Lieutenant A. G. Verezgov, to questions of the government 
commission (interrogation tape recording): 
  Question: ``Did you hear the report from compartment 7 
that everything was well?'' 
  Answer: ``I didn't hear this report personally. The 
fact is that the watch officer's console or, more accurately, 
desk is located a slight distance away from the command post of 
BCh-5. Therefore when he receives reports, the watch mechanical 
engineer reports to me. He reported to me that the submarine had 
been inspected, without remarks, somewhere around 1100. As a 
rule the watchstanders make their reports (well, that's the way 
we did it) 5 minutes before the scheduled time.'' 
  Question: ``Are these messages transmitted by 
loudspeaker?'' 
  Answer: ``That's right, they're transmitted by the 
``Listvennitsa''[.sup]17[/], from the compartments.'' 
  Question: ``And you didn't hear a single report?'' 
  Answer: ``The fact is that he (The watch mechanical 
engineer.--D.R.) keeps the volume down a little. He makes it so 
that only he could hear, not so that it would be silent, but so 
that only the watch mechanic could hear, without distracting the 
rest of the personnel serving watch at other stations.'' 
  Captain Lieutenant Verezgov, who was the watch officer, was 
closest of all to Captain 3d Rank V. A. Yudin, who received the 
compartment inspection reports. Still, he did not hear the 
reports from the compartment watchstanders. Captain Lieutenant 
Dvorov and Lieutenant Fedotko heard these reports, although they 
were farther away from the watch mechanic. 
  Thus all that remains is to suppose that a report had been 
transmitted by the watchstander for compartment 7, and that the 
time of the report may have been 1055, and even earlier. 
  So when did the fire start? One thing is clear: This 
happened 
before 1103, when the command to deliver LOKh to compartment 7 
was given. 
  Here is what participants of the tragedy have to say about 
this (interrogation tape recording): 
  Warrant Officer V. V. Gerashchenko: ``Around 5 or 10 
minutes before 1100 the lights, especially the incandescent 
lamps, began blinking in the gyro-compass room. I went up to the 
monitoring equipment of the ``Mindal'' power supply system. It 
was my duty to check the power supply parameters once every 4 
hours. I checked them. All of the parameters seemed to be 
normal. The blinking lights were powered by the ship's general 
power network. My instruments have their own power supply.'' 
  This was apparently the first manifestation of the fire's 
start. The time was probably 1055. The fire continued to grow. 
  Captain Lieutenant V. A. Gregulev: ``The technician 
said that voltage drops had been observed before the accident, 
which was noticeable from the sound of the fan--that is, power 
was fluctuating 2 or 3 minutes before the alarm.'' 
  Lieutenant K. A. Fedotko: ``I was the engineer of the 
electronic navigation group. I was at my console, on watch in 
the control room. When Yudin said that the temperature in 
compartment 7 was over 70C...'' 
  Question: ``You heard that yourself?'' 
  Answer: ``Yes, I did. Senior Lieutenant Markov was 
sitting at the ``Onega'' console. He looked troubled. I used the 
``Listvennitsa'' system to report to the gyro-compass room that 
the electricians might be switching the systems. I told the 
warrant officer in the gyro-compass room to turn his attention 
to the work of the navigation system.'' 
  Warrant Officer V. V. Gerashchenko: ``This is when 
Lieutenant Fedotko, who was the watch navigator, said: 
``Vasiliy, how are things going? The electricians seem to be 
doing something there''. '' 
  All of this confirms that if a report had been made 
regarding 
inspection of compartment 7, it was made at 1055. 
  Was discovery of the fire reported to the attack center, and 
when? Let's listen to the crew members: 
  Lieutenant A. V. Zaytsev (explanatory report): ``When I 
heard the alarm signal I went from my cabin to the ``Molibden'' 
control console. I relieved Captain 3d Rank Yudin, the damage 
control division commander, at the console. I heard him say to 
Captain 2d Rank Babenko, BCh-5 commander: ``There's a fire in 
compartment 7.'' Bukhnikashvili reported the fire, after which 
two thuds could be heard, like the sound of air-lock doors 
closing.'' 
  Captain 1st Rank B. G. Kolyada (interrogation tape 
recording): ``I believe that at 1 minute before 1100 Seaman 
Bukhnikashvili reported that compartment 7 had been inspected, 
that there were no remarks, and that the gas composition of the 
air was 20 percent oxygen. And literally just a few minutes 
later a report was transmitted from compartment 7: ``Damage 
control alarm, fire in compartment 7,'' but none of the 
survivors heard this.'' 
  A few comments on Kolyada's statement. The captain 1st rank 
is the only surviving crew member who recalls information on the 
oxygen concentration in compartment 7 in the watchstander's 
report, even though he was not present in the attack center 
during the reports of the watchstanders concerning inspection of 
the compartments; moreover the figure he gives for the oxygen 
concentration in compartment 7 is significantly below the 
permissible norms (21.5-23 percent), and in practical terms this 
could not have been. There's an obvious discrepancy here, which 
makes us suppose that during his interrogation by the government 
commission, Kolyada concealed the possible cause of the fire. 
  Relying on the testimony of Lieutenant Zaytsev and Captain 
1st Rank Kolyada, we can assume that the watchstander for 
compartment 7 reported the fire before 1103. But this absolutely 
refutes the official version of the navy concerning the 
compartment fire, which was presented later on in a joint order 
of the USSR Minister of Defense and the USSR Minister of Ship 
Building Industry. And so a metamorphosis occurs: ``The fire in 
compartment 7 began with an explosion, and consequently it would 
be blasphemous to accuse deceased Senior Seaman N. 
Bukhnikashvili of acting in a manner different from his actions 
in training exercises. He was stunned, killed in the very first 
seconds of the accident,'' declared Kolyada in the 15 January 
1990 edition of IZVESTIYA. 
  As far as I know no one has ever accused Senior Seaman 
Bukhnikashvili. On the contrary his actions during the accident 
were apparently fully competent: He reported the fire, fought 
the flames using an air-foam fire extinguisher, and he perished 
in this fight. But then, we can ask the captain 1st rank an 
impartial question. When was he speaking the truth, before the 
government commission or when he was being interviewed by the 
writer N. Cherkashin? The answer to this question is clear. 
Kolyada's entire interview, beginning with incompetent notions 
regarding an ``experimental vessel'' and ending with the 
shameful assertions that the crew had dealt with the fire with 
minimum sacrifices (apparently the demise of a submarine and 42 
crewmembers is a minimum sacrifice!), was false and unobjective. 
  The joint order cited above states that ``at 1103 the 
compartment became fully involved with fire of great intensity, 
causing a leak in the high-pressure air system, which brought 
about a rapid increase in pressure and temperature in 
compartment 7.'' There are no grounds for such an assertion. As 
was mentioned earlier, a command to use the fire extinguishing 
system had already been given at 1103, meaning that the fire had 
started at this moment. Certain conditions had to exist in the 
compartment for it to become fully involved: Flammable materials 
had to be distributed throughout the entire compartment (spilled 
or sprayed oil, fuel etc.). Consequently the compartment could 
not have been a ``fully involved'' right from the start. It 
became fully involved later on. This logical conclusion is 
reinforced by entries in the ship's log and the testimony of 
surviving members of the submarine crew. Tentative calculations 
show that if compartment 7 had in fact become fully involved 
from the very beginning, the consequences of the accident would 
have been minimal. 
  Why did naval representatives find it necessary to 
``condense'' the initial stage of the fire's development, and 
invent a story about a fully involved compartment ``rapidly 
causing a leak in the high- pressure air lines''? There was but 
one goal--to justify the delay and the incompetent actions of 
the submarine's leadership in the initial period of the 
accident, and to prove that it was impossible to save the ship, 
and that the crew could not have taken any more- radical actions 
in the fight for the submarine's survival. This point of view 
was advantageous to the bureaucratic command system of the 
military-industrial complex. This deception was also aided by 
the unprincipled, conniving policy of the leadership of the 
design office. 
  Be that as it may, what might have caused the fire? The 
joint 
order cited above states that ``a fire in electrical equipment 
of the rudder hydraulic system pump starting station or in the 
oil separation system due to maladjustment of controlling 
devices and this equipment's safety system was the possible 
primary cause of the submarine's disaster.'' And as a reluctant 
concession to opponents, it was added that ``this may have been 
promoted by a possible increase in the oxygen concentration in 
the compartment's atmosphere above the permissible level.'' But 
in the government commission's report there is absolutely no 
mention of oxygen as one of the possible causes of the tragedy 
that occurred aboard the submarine. The ``royal host'' of the 
navy won the battle! 
  But why did the government commission select the versions 
mentioned above as the possible primary causes of the accident? 
According to these versions, it appears at first glance that 
there are no clear culprits for the fire, which suited the naval 
leadership and the party apparatus, and it didn't hurt the USSR 
Ministry of Ship Building Industry very much--that is, it suited 
everyone. 
  What was at the basis of the versions accepted by the 
government commission? 
  The ``pump'' version. It is assumed that as a 
result of breakdown of automatic system components, rapid 
spontaneous switching on and off of the starting stations of one 
of the hydraulic system pumps (a so-called ``bell'' effect) 
began, which caused burning of contacts, the appearance of an 
arc discharge, and ultimately a fire in the compartment. 
However, an experiment conducted by the government commission's 
working group on the work of a starting station in ``bell'' mode 
produced a negative result even when the oxygen concentration in 
the atmosphere was high. In real conditions, work of the 
starting station of the hydraulic system pump aboard the 
submarine in ``bell'' mode would have been noticed by the 
operator at the ``Molibden'' console, and the faulty pump would 
have been disconnected with no consequences to the compartment. 
Moreover the pump's malfunction would have also been detected by 
the watchstander for compartment 7, and it could have been 
contained here as well. 
  Crew testimony revealed that the warning signal 
``Temperature 
in compartment 7 above 70C'' lit up first, and only after 
that or simultaneously with it did the warning signal ``Low 
insulation resistance'' light up. This alone completely excludes 
the version suggesting that the fire in compartment 7 had an 
electrical cause. The government commission's working group 
established that it was most probable that the fire began in the 
fore section of compartment 7, on the port side--that is, away 
from the location of the hydraulic system pump starting 
stations. In short, the government commission's working group 
had no objective data of any kind to substantiate this version. 
  The ``separator'' version. The oil separation 
system contains an electric oil heater. It is suggested that oil 
overheated in the oil heater while the separator was not 
working, resulting in boiling of the oil, followed by a flash 
and a fire (oil in a working separator would not become 
overheated to the flash point). An experiment confirmed the 
possibility of such ignition of the oil heater over a period of 
around 15 minutes. The oil heater was located in the fore 
section of compartment 7, on the port side--that is, within the 
zone of the supposed initiation of the fire. However, the oil 
separation system was disconnected early in the morning on 7 
April, and it was not working before the accident. The oil 
heater connecting circuit is interlocked with the pressure relay 
(the oil heater can be switched on only when the separator is 
operating) and with the temperature relay, which turns off the 
oil heater when the oil temperature exceeds the permissible 
limit. 
  This version may be accepted if we allow the following 
assumptions: 
  1. The pressure relay and the temperature relay failed 
simultaneously (which is practically excluded), or they were 
deliberately blocked and were in the ``on'' position. 
  2. The watchstander for compartment 7 deliberately turned on 
the oil heater without turning on the separator, which is 
prohibited by the operating instructions. 
  3. The watchstander for compartment 7 left the compartment 
after turning on the oil heater (according to the experiment 
intensive production of smoke from the oil heater began in the 
8th-10th minute, which the watchstander would certainly have 
noticed, and he would have switched off the oil heater). 
  4. The operator at the console of the main propulsion unit 
paid no attention to unsanctioned engagement of the oil heater. 
  Thus if we assume that this version is possible, we would 
have to say that the fire in compartment 7 arose due to the 
personnel's grossest violations of instructions and manuals on 
equipment operation, or due to deliberate sabotage. But in 
promoting this version as the primary cause of the accident, the 
government commission's working group shamefully remains silent 
about its preconditions. 
  Neither of these versions explains the high intensity with 
which the fire developed in the initial stage, or all the more 
so, the fable that the compartment supposedly became fully 
involved right from the very beginning. And in order to end the 
analysis of these versions, we turn the floor over to Captain 
1st Rank Kolyada (interrogation tape recording): 
  ``A telegram reporting an accident aboard the submarine 
``B-354''--a distribution panel catching fire--was received on 
the fourth (The reference is to 4 April 1989, 3 days before the 
accident.--D.R.). The fleet commander ordered an inspection of 
all cable routes, and of the condition of distribution panels 
and electrical equipment. I gave the command to inspect all of 
the electrical equipment that day. On the fifth at 2100 the 
commanders of all departments reported that the electrical 
equipment had been inspected. There were no remarks.'' 
  Let's believe Kolyada in this matter, all the more so 
because 
there is not even a hint in all of his statements to the press 
that the submarine's electrical equipment may have been the 
cause of the fire. 
Second, no ``fundamentally conflicting actions'' were required 
of the crew. Under these circumstances compartment 7 should have 
been sealed off in order to preclude the spread of the fire and 
of smoke gases into other compartments, and simultaneously with 
this, there should have been controlled relief of excess 
pressure from the distressed compartment through one of the ship 
systems (preferably through the ship's pumping system) with the 
purpose of reducing the intensity of the fire and ensuring the 
strength of the bulkheads of the distressed compartment. None of 
this was done aboard the submarine. 
  Third, concealing the truth, the authors of this postulate 
unwittingly introduced the harmful and mistaken idea into the 
consciousness of submariners that when accidents occur, there 
may be circumstances which create dead-end, impossible 
situations--that is, they demoralize and disarm submariners 
regarding accidents before the fact. 
  But let's return to the submarine ``Komsomolets''. 
  The command to open the first and second shut-offs of the 
exhaust line of the fore and aft rings of the ship's ventilation 
system was given simultaneously. 
  As soon as the ``Korund'' console caught fire an 
announcement 
was transmitted through the ship: ``Damage control alarm! Fire 
in compartment 3!'' There are no entries to this effect in the 
ship's log. However, the testimony of crewmembers and the logic 
of the development of subsequent events permit the categorical 
assertion that an alarm signal was sounded after 1122. 
  Warrant Officer A. M. Kopeyka (explanatory report): ``A 
damage control alarm, a fire, was announced, the ``Korund'' 
control console was burning in compartment 3, this was 
communicated to us by BC-1 [navigation department] commander 
Captain Lieutenant Smirnov, because the loudspeaker 
communication alarm line failed, while communication with the 
navigator's console was still functioning.'' 
  Warrant Officer V. V. Gerashchenko (interrogation tape 
recording): ``Everything happened so fast. An order was given 
for everyone to connect up to the DA. A few minutes later the 
navigator told me over the ``Listvennitsa'': ``Fire in 
compartment 3,`` Korund'' (the rudder control console) 
burning.'' Ventilation and cooling were lost right away, and 
``Temperature exceeded'' warning lights appeared. I reported 
this to the navigator.'' 
  In response to the command ``Damage control alarm! Fire in 
compartment 3!'' personnel of compartment 2 deenergized the 
distribution panel No. 7 of compartment 3 in accordance with 
requirements of Article 91 of the RBZ-PL-82. 
  The command apparently also reached compartment 5, and 
complying with the requirements of Article 91 of the RBZ-PL-82, 
the personnel of this compartment deenergized distribution panel 
RShCHN No. 6 of compartment 3. 
  The fact of disconnection of distribution panels RShchN 
No. 7 and 6 is confirmed by Warrant Officer A. M. Kopeyka 
(explanatory report): ``...the second ventilation ring was 
working, but the temperature kept increasing, because it was not 
tied in (That is, not connected.--D.R.) to all instrument 
stands. When we requested power to RShchN No. 7/1 and RShchN No. 
6/1 in order to supply the main ventilation ring, no one could'' 
[do anything]. 
  Distribution panels RShchN No. 7/1 and 6/1 receive power 
from 
distribution panel RShchN No. 7 and 6 respectively. 
  Thus not only the electric fan of the first (main) ring of 
the navigation complex's cooling system but also the electric 
pump of the diesel generator's cooling system, the exhaust fans 
of the ship's general ventilation system, and the electric fan 
of the cooling system of the combat data processing and control 
system were left without electric power. This was one of the 
reasons why an order to stop the diesel generator was given at 
1145. Because of this, it was impossible to begin venting 
compartment 3 in time, and for a long time the control room 
personnel were forced to wear ShDA apparatus, which made 
submarine damage control difficult. Nor could venting of the aft 
compartments be started in time. 
  Concluding our examination of this issue, we should say that 
after the fire in the ``Korund'' console was put out, the attack 
center did not transmit the command ``All clear from the damage 
control alarm ``Fire in compartment 3!'','' and it did not order 
delivery of power to distribution panels RShchN No. 7 and 6, 
which was another mistake by the submarine's leadership. 
  Testimony by Warrant Officer Kopeyka regarding the work of 
the second cooling ring of the navigation system needs to be 
clarified. The electric fan of the second cooling ring is 
supplied from sections of the disconnectable load of the main 
distribution panels; it was deenergized immediately after the 
reactor's emergency shielding was activated. Considering that 
instruments of the navigation system connected to the second 
ring were cooled by means of an open ventilation cycle, the 
temperature conditions of these instruments were ``milder'' 
during the accident because of natural air circulation, than 
those experienced by instruments which were connected to the 
first ring and which were cooled by means of a closed 
ventilation cycle. This apparently created the illusion in the 
warrant officer that the second ring of the navigation system 
instrument cooling system was working. 
  Pressure began to rise in compartment 5. 
  Lieutenant A. V. Zaytsev (supplement to explanatory 
report): ``Monitoring air pressure in the submarine's 
compartments, at the moment the fire began at the ``Korund'' 
control console I noticed an insignificant rise in pressure in 
compartment 5, on the order of 0.5 kg/cm[.sup]2[/].'' 
  Captain Lieutenant S. A. Dvorov (interrogation tape 
recording): ``I was in constant communication, and I gave the 
command for all of the men to stay in the central passage. It 
was very steamy in the vicinity of the turbopump circulating 
units, and my glasses were fogging over. The temperature grew. 
All of the men were connected up to IPs.[.sup]32[/] The 
pressure began increasing to 2.5 kilograms. We switched over to 
IDA-59 equipment. The pressure continued to rise.'' 
  A clarification is needed here. In his explanatory report 
Captain Lieutenant Dvorov made reference to pressure in 
compartment 5 equal not to 2.5 kg/cm[.sup]2[/] but only 0.5, 
and this was apparently the case. In addition according to the 
RBZh-PL-82, IP-6 self- contained breathing protective masks may 
be used only to an excess pressure of not more than 0.2 
kg/cm[.sup]2[/] in compartments. When the personnel put on 
the face masks of the IDA-59 self- contained breathing 
apparatus, two of them were torn, which is why Seaman V. Yu. 
Kulanin and Warrant Officer S. S. Bondar were forced to hook up 
to ShDA apparatus, which predetermined their subsequent fate. 
<H5>  Who Discharged the VPL System? </H5>
[.sup]33[/] 
  From the ship's log: 
  ``1123--``Bukhta'' operating 10 minutes without 
cooling. Deenergize ``Sinus.'' Deenergize ``Korund''.'' 
  The ``Bukhta'' radar station was working without cooling. In 
a little while it would be disconnected as well. From this 
moment on, the submarine would be left without electronic 
observation resources. 
  The command was given to deenergize the ``Sinus''--the power 
supply system of the submarine's automatic equipment control 
system. There was no need to deenergize the entire power supply 
system of the automatic equipment control system in order to put 
out the fire in the ``Korund'' console. For this, it would have 
been enough to deenergize the ``Korund'' system. When the 
``Sinus'' system is deenergized, remote control and monitoring 
of all of the submarine's technical resources is lost, with the 
exception of the reactor's emergency shielding and certain 
especially important ship systems supporting ship damage control 
efforts (such as the emergency main ballast tank blowing 
system). It is not known if this command was carried out. The 
entry ``Deenergize ``Korund'' '' should be understood, due to 
the illegibly written suffix, as `` ``Korund'' deenergized.'' 
The command to deenergize the ``Korund'' system had been given 
at 1122. 
  From the ship's log: 
  ``1127--VPL delivered to ``Korund.'' Shut-offs 1 and 2 
opened. Fire extinguisher brought to TsP. Open flames have 
appeared on the ``Korund.'' Gas concentration and visibility in 
TsP rising ((Sic).-- D.R.). VPL recharging in first. Out of the 
TsVK.[.sup]34[/] Burning in vicinity of 7th.'' 
  Lieutenant A. V. Tretyakov (supplement to explanatory 
report): ``The fire in compartment 3 was put out as follows: 
Captain 1st Rank Burkulakov noticed smoke coming from the 
``Korund.'' Then came the command ``Everyone connect up to 
personal protective equipment! Begin fighting the fire with the 
VPL!'' Taking a socket wrench, Captain Lieutenant Naumenko 
unfastened the lid from the console, where he saw flames licking 
out. The VPL dispenser and hose were carried over.'' 
  They were unable to put out the console fire. It turns out 
that the VPL system was discharged. 
  Lieutenant A. V. Zaytsev (interrogation tape 
recording): ``We tried to use fire extinguishers. The first 
produced a little foam, and then went dead. If it had produced 
normal foam, the fire would have been put out completely.'' 
  We don't know if other fire extinguishers were used as well, 
but one thing is clear--it cannot be said that the quality of 
the submarine crew's preparation for the cruise was high. 
Because there turned out to be nothing with which to put out the 
``Korund'' console fire, a command was given to recharge the VPL 
station in compartment 1. 
  According to Article 91 of RBZh-PL-82, in case of fire the 
personnel must monitor the status of the VPL station and 
recharge it promptly without orders from the attack center. 
However, personnel of compartment 1 did not monitor the status 
of the VPL station, and did not recharge it promptly, which made 
it impossible to immediately put out the fire in the console of 
the ``Korund'' rudder control system. 
  Warrant Officer S. R. Grigoryan (supplement to 
explanatory report): ``VPL was recharged in compartment 1 in 
response to a command from the TsP. During recharging I noticed 
that the VPL pressure was 15 kg/cm[.sup]2[/], while before 
the regulator it was 150 kg/cm[.sup]2[/]. And the pressure 
steadily decreased.'' 
  The fire in compartment 7 continued. Air from the 
medium-pressure air line, and possibly from the outboard air 
line, continued to feed it. No one took any steps to stop the 
bleeding of air into the distressed compartment. At this time a 
report of steam build- up in the vicinity of compartment 7 was 
transmitted from the bridge at this time--this is the only 
possible interpretation of the ship's log entry presented above. 
Lining plates began separating away from the right side of the 
submarine's outer hull, in the vicinity of main ballast tank No. 
10, which was noted by Captain Lieutenant Verezgov. It may be 
supposed that entry of smoke from the digital computer complex 
was discovered at this time. 
  And while they are recharging the VPL system in compartment 
1, let's analyze why the system was uncharged. There was no 
unanimous opinion in this regard in the government commission's 
working group. Industrial representatives felt that the VPL 
system had been discharged by the watchstander for compartment 7 
as he fought the fire. Naval representatives asserted that the 
VPL system was discharged in compartment 5 after combustible 
gases ignited within it. The ship's log has no entry regarding 
such a deflagration in compartment 5. Nor was the time of this 
deflagration noted in Captain Lieutenant Dvorov's testimony. 
When questioned by the government commission he reported that 
the deflagration occurred 10-15 minutes before normalization of 
pressure in compartment 5-- that is, in the period from 1151 to 
1156, since according to the ship's log, pressure was cut off 
from compartments 4 and 5 from 1206 to 1218. It is stated in an 
explanatory report written later on that the deflagration 
occurred 10-15 minutes after the alarm-- that is, in the period 
from 1116 to 1121. 
  Warrant Officer V. S. Kadantsev (explanatory report): 
``While the temperature of the bulkhead between compartments 5 
and 6 was being measured, the VPL reel was unwound in the 
central passage of compartment 5. There was a puddle of brown 
water beside the bell mouth, and air was hissing out from it. It 
was the same with the reel in the enclosure of the 
turbocirculation pump unit. I shut the valves.'' 
  It follows from Warrant Officer Kadantsev's report that the 
VPL line was leaking in compartment 7, and that air was passing 
from it into compartment 5. Moreover the last time the VPL 
system was used was in compartment 5--otherwise foam would have 
streamed out of the open hoses after the VPL system was 
recharged, and personnel in compartment 5 would have noticed 
this, and shut the ``Korund''. Consequently the VPL system in 
compartment 5 had already been used prior to this time. We 
should add to this that because of high pressure in compartment 
7 (around 10-12 kg/cm[.sup]2[/], practically no foam was 
expended in it during this period. 
  Captain Lieutenant S. A. Dvorov (supplement to 
explanatory report): ``When the fire started in compartment 5, I 
personally reported the fire in the compartment to the TsP on 
the damage control telephone, but I got no answer from the GKP.'' 
  Lieutenant A. V. Zaytsev (explanatory report): 
``Immediately after surfacing, the ``Korund'' console began 
smoking in the control room. Captain Lieutenant Naumenko and I 
started putting it out. It was reported from compartment 5 that 
there was a fire in compartment 5. After VPL station No. 1 was 
recharged, the fire in the ``Korund'' control console was put 
out.'' 
  Lieutenant A. V. Zaytsev (supplement to explanatory 
report): ``Fires were reported from compartments 4 and 5 almost 
simultaneously with putting out the fire in the ``Korund'' 
console. The report from compartment 4 indicated the specific 
place of the fire. Information regarding the fire in compartment 
5 was provided by the executive officer and the BCh-5 
commander.'' 
  Captain 1st Rank B. G. Kolyada (interrogation tape 
recording): ``There was no communication with compartment 5, and 
we did not learn of the fire in it until the compartment was 
opened. The commander of compartment 5 reported that they had a 
fully involved fire.'' 
  How do we reconcile the contradictory reports by Lieutenant 
Zaytsev and Captain 1st Rank Kolyada? Especially if we consider 
that in the supplement to his explanatory report, Lieutenant 
Zaytsev clearly ``tried harder'' to please the naval leadership. 
During the time that the fire in the ``Korund'' console was 
being put out, it could not have been that ``Fires were reported 
from compartments 4 and 5 almost simultaneously,'' since the 
report of fire in the starting station of the first loop pump in 
compartment 4 was received by the attack center before the fire 
started in the ``Korund'' console, which is documented in the 
ship's log. This fact casts doubt upon Zaytsev's testimony 
regarding a fire in compartment 5. Still, the submarine command 
did apparently receive the report of a deflagration in 
compartment 5. 
  Was information on the fire in compartment 5 reflected in 
the 
actions of the submarine command? Let's look at the ship's log: 
  ``1146--Report temperature in compartment 5. 
  1147--Lines of defense in compartment 4--fore and aft 
bulkheads, in 3--the aft bulkhead.'' 
  These entries in the ship's log are nothing other than a 
reaction by the submarine command to the report they received of 
a deflagration in compartment 5. We can categorically assume 
from these entries that the deflagration occurred in compartment 
5 at around 1146. Thus Senior Seaman N. O. Bukhnikashvili, the 
watchstander for compartment 7, not only reported the fire but 
also fought it using the VPL system, as a result of which the 
system was discharged. 
  It is necessary to go on at such length about all of this 
simply because the naval members of the government commission's 
working group, who ignored the facts, insisted upon the legend 
of a ``fully involved fire'' from the very beginning of the 
accident, and asserted that the VPL system had been discharged 
by personnel of compartment 5. 
<H5>  List Control </H5>
  RBZh-PL-82, Article 84: ``When the main ballast tanks 
are damaged but water does not enter the pressure hull of a 
surfaced submarine, right the submarine in accordance with 
documents on keeping a damaged submarine afloat and the RBITS, 
and monitor the submarine's attitude more closely, blowing as 
necessary the undamaged main ballast tanks not equipped with 
kingston valves as they fill.'' 
  As was mentioned earlier, the ``Manual on Combat Use of 
Technical Resources'' (RBITS) had not been written by Naval 
Institute No. 1 for the submarine ``Komsomolets''. The 
submarine's attitude was not monitored during the entire 
accident. 
  From the ship's log: 
  ``1134--List to port increasing. Main ballast tank 
blown, list 8.'' 
  Another mistake by the attack center. Pressure in 
compartment 
7 was growing due to entry of air into it from the 
medium-pressure air (VSD), outboard air (VZU) and 200 
kg/cm[.sup]2[/] high- pressure air (VVD-200) lines. Hot air 
entered the right main ballast tank No. 10 together with 
combustion products through the damaged emergency blowing line, 
and purged it. This caused the list to port to grow. The 
submarine command did not even try to determine the reason for 
the increasing list. No one checked the status of the ballast 
tanks. Instead of this they repeatedly blew the end groups of 
the main ballast tanks. They uselessly expended the 
high-pressure air reserve and added fresh air to compartment 7, 
which intensified the fire. There are no grounds for asserting 
that even after this, the valves of the emergency blowing system 
of the aft group of main ballast tanks, located on air cofferdam 
No. 4 in compartment 7, worked spontaneously, because the watch 
officer at the bridge did not note spontaneous blowing of these 
tanks. 
  From the ship's log: 
  ``1136--VPL delivered a second time to ``Korund''. '' 
  1137--Transmit damage control signal. ``Korund'' fire 
put out. Damage control signal transmitted. Open supply line's 
clack valve.'' 
  The VPL system was recharged, and the fire in the ``Korund'' 
console was put out with it. The damage control signal was 
prepared for transmission 19 minutes previously, but it was not 
until this time that it was first transmitted. The consequences 
of this delay have already been discussed. There was a great 
deal of smoke in the attack center and all of compartment 3. It 
was impossible to start up the exhaust fan of the forward ring 
of the ship ventilation system because of the absence of power 
at distribution panel RShchN No. 7. Because of the absence of 
cooling, the diesel generator was working at low rpm, and it was 
unable to remove smoke gases from compartment 3. Under these 
conditions the submarine's leadership apparently decided to 
start up the electric supply fan of the forward ring of the ship 
ventilation system, and gave the command to open the outer clack 
valve on the ventilation supply line. 
  Lieutenant A. V. Zaytsev (explanatory note): ``It was 
impossible to start up the supply fans.'' 
  The electric supply fans of the ship ventilation system 
received electric power from disconnectable load sections of the 
main distribution panels; they were deenergized after the 
reactor's emergency shielding was activated. 
  The command to open the clack valves was apparently not 
carried out. 
  From the ship's log: 
  ``1142--No communication with 6. Command to open clack 
valve transmitted from 3 to 4 by tapping on wall. 
  1143--Clack valve opened on exhaust...4 and 5. List 
correcting itself.'' 
  The attack center is still unaware of the fire in 
compartment 
6. This is the only way that the entry regarding absence of 
communication with it can be interpreted. It is unclear in this 
case how Captain Lieutenant Dvorov could be so certain that he 
reported the fire in compartment 6 to the command. 
  At the same time the command to open the clack valve of the 
exhaust ventilation system between compartments 4 and 5 was 
transmitted to compartment 4 by tapping on the wall, apparently 
to reduce pressure from compartment 5 through the exhaust line 
of the forward ring of the ship ventilation system. But there 
was no one to carry out this command, because Lieutenant Makhota 
and Warrant Officer Valyavin were helpless in the instrument 
enclosure. 
  How do we interpret the two conflicting entries differing by 
2 minutes: ``List increasing'' and ``List correcting itself''? 
What was done by the personnel to correct the list? The ship's 
log is silent about this. Lieutenant Zaytsev, the operator of 
the ``Molibden'' console, is also silent. And what do the other 
participants of the tragedy have to say? Here are two 
explanatory reports: 
  Captain Lieutenant I. S. Orlov: ``There was a report 
``No. 1 TsNPK station is burning'' from compartment 4, after 
which there was no more communication. My subsequent actions 
were as follows: While monitoring the cooling process, in 
response to a command from BCh-5 commander Captain Lieutenant 
Nezhutin and I, the commander of the remote control division, 
opened and closed the vent valves of the right main ballast tank 
No. 5 to correct the list manually.'' 
  Warrant Officer V. S. Kadantsev: ``When the submarine 
surfaced, it was listing to port. To right it, the right main 
ballast tank No. 5 and the right main ballast tank No. 7 were 
filled.'' 
  Flooding of the right main ballast tank No. 7 will be 
discussed later on; for now let's analyze the matter of the 
right main ballast tank No. 5. The hydraulic drives of the vent 
valves of this tank (shut-offs 1 and 2) are located practically 
beneath the chair of the operator of the main propulsion unit 
console; quite naturally, therefore, console operator Captain 
Lieutenant Orlov should have helped to open the tank vent 
valves. At the end of the tragedy warrant officer Kadantsev 
personally blew the right main ballast tank No. 5 on orders from 
the BCh-5 commander. In this connection there are no grounds for 
believing the testimony of Orlov and Kadantsev. 
  And so, in order to correct the list to port the decision to 
flood the right main ballast tank No. 5 was made in the attack 
center. What can be said about this decision? First of all, a 
list of even 8 is not dangerous from the standpoint of 
maintaining the submarine's transverse equilibrium, and 
sacrificing buoyancy reserve on it is highly unsuitable. Second, 
before the submarine's list was corrected, the reason for it 
should have been clarified, which was not done. Third, neither 
the instructions nor the training manual recommend correcting 
list by flooding the ballast tank in the middle group. In this 
case if the decision had been made to correct the ship's list, 
the ballast tank of the forward group should have been flooded. 
This would have made it possible not only to correct the list 
but also to trim the submarine. The main danger to a submarine 
is the loss not of transverse but of longitudinal equilibrium. 
Such that on the whole, the decision of the submarine command to 
flood the right main ballast tank No. 5 was incompetent. 
  Nonetheless, the right main ballast tank No. 5 was flooded, 
but the list was not corrected--on the contrary, it increased 
somewhat. That should be the interpretation of the entries in 
the ship's log for the period from 1141 to 1143. 
  Why did this happen? Prior to the accident the submarine was 
at a depth of 386 meters. At this depth the main ballast tank 5 
should have been connected for blowing by powder gas generators. 
During emergency surfacing, in all probability ``Molibden'' 
console operator Lieutenant Zaytsev did not connect the tank to 
the high-pressure air blowing line, and the submarine surfaced 
with main ballast tank No. 5 unblown. When the vent valves were 
opened, water from the tanks on the right side drained off down 
to the water line, which resulted in a certain increase in list 
to port. This was apparently so much of a surprise to the attack 
center that it tempered its eagerness to fight listing for a 
long time. In addition the carelessness in blowing the tank is 
in all probability the main reason why Lieutenant Zaytsev 
concealed the fact of flooding of the right main ballast tank 
No. 5. 
<H5>  Fire in Compartment 5 </H5>
  What happened in compartment 5 after pressure in it 
increased 
to 0.5 kg/cm[.sup]2[/] and continued to increase? Let's 
listen to tape recordings of the interrogation. 
  Captain Lieutenant S. A. Dvorov: ``At this moment a 
major explosion or fully developed fire--I don't know what to 
call it-- arose in compartment 5. Blue flames shot along the 
entire passage from the fore to the aft bulkhead like from a 
flamethrower from a height of 1 meter above the deck all the way 
up to the ceiling. The sheaf of flame passed by, clothing and 
hair caught fire, and a minute later it was gone. The people put 
out the burning clothing. Serious burns were suffered by Volkov 
(his hands) and others. The fire traveled from bow to stern 
along the central passage. I believe that this was oil vapor, 
possibly from oil tanks of the TTsNA [not further identified] 
turbopump units. That's what I think.'' 
  Question: ``Where did the oil vapor come from?'' 
  Answer: ``I think through the oil tank venting system. 
Nothing was switched.'' 
  Question: ``What do you estimate the temperature to 
have been prior to that major explosion?'' 
  Answer: ``At first it was not very high, not less than 
50C, but after the deflagration Kolya Volkov's mask melted. 
There was no smoldering or fire below. After the explosion we 
were in the central passage. I believe that the explosion 
occurred when I switched off the turbopump unit's oil pump.... 
Pressure dropped after the explosion, coming to normal 10-15 
minutes after the explosion. Visibility in the smoke was 1-1.5 
meters.'' 
  Seaman Yu. V. Kozlov: ``There was no fire. There was no 
intense flame. It was like a deflagration. I can't explain this. 
Lying on my right side, I could see from the corner of my eye 
that something passed by, there was a bluish deflagration. It 
took about a second. It burned my hand.'' 
  What was the cause of the deflagration in compartment 5? 
There are two versions regarding this question. In one, oil 
vapor caught fire. This is possible only if hot gases entered 
one of the oil tanks of the TTsNA turbopump units from 
compartment 7 through the oil separation line, which may not 
have been reset in its initial position after work (before the 
accident). These gases may have heated the oil, and its vapor 
may have been carried through ventilation pipes into the central 
passage of compartment 5. According to the other version, 
ignition of incomplete combustion products passing from 
compartment 5 to compartment 6 occurred. Naval representatives 
in the government commission's working group believe in this 
case that incomplete combustion products entered through the 
suction system's line and through seals in the TTsNA turbopump 
units, and lay responsibility for this ignition upon the 
designer, because this line cannot be shut off from the 
direction of compartment 5 (this design error was discussed 
earlier). 
  It is true that this pipeline, which has a diameter of 50 
millimeters, cannot be shut from the direction of compartment 5. 
It can be shut only from the direction of compartment 6. But 
300- millimeter diameter lines carrying spent steam from the 
TTsNA turbopump units could have been shut both from the 
direction of compartment 6 and from the direction of compartment 
5, but this was not done. And most of the incomplete combustion 
products may have traveled from compartment 6 through a system 
of seals into compartment 5 via the spent steam line, and not 
the suction system line. In addition calculations showed that it 
would have been impossible for the pressure in compartment 5 to 
increase to 0.5 kg/cm[.sup]2[/] as a result of entry of gases 
through the system of seals on the TTsNA turbopump units in the 
time from 1118 (the moment supply of steam to the units stopped 
due to activation of the reactor's emergency shielding) to 1122. 
This would have required not less than 30 minutes. Consequently 
if we accept this version, then we would have to agree that the 
incomplete combustion products entered compartment 5 chiefly 
through another system, and particularly the pressure equalizing 
line between compartments 5 and 6. The valve of this line is 
always open under normal operating conditions, and it may have 
been closed after some delay during the accident. The 
deflagration itself passed through the central passage of 
compartment 5--that is, near the location of the outlet of the 
pressure equalizing line, and not along the sides where the 
turbopump units were located. 
  Which of these versions is plausible? 
  In order to establish this, we need to return to Captain 
Lieutenant Dvorov's testimony: 
  ``Compartment 5 was sealed off. Considerable steaming 
was observed in the vicinity of TTsNA units No. 1 and 2. They 
were stopped, which was checked by tachometers'' (explanatory 
report). 
  ``The compartment was sealed off, the TTsNA turbopump 
units were already idle at this moment. I think that the 
reactor's emergency shielding had activated'' (interrogation 
tape recording). 
  It follows from this that the personnel had not stopped the 
TTsNA units themselves. Nor were they stopped by the main 
propulsion unit console operator, because they could be stopped 
only after the main turbogear unit and the turbogenerators went 
off line. Nor could the TTsNA units have been stopped after 
activation of the reactor's emergency shielding, as Captain 
Lieutenant Dvorov proposes, because after cessation of steam 
delivery, the units would be driven by an electric drive 
supplied from distribution panels RShchN No. 8 and RShchN No. 9 
of the nondisconnectable load sections of the main distribution 
panels. 
  The units can be stopped only by their own safety system 
(their stopping as a result of closing of the circulating line's 
clack valves is not an issue, because closure of the clack 
valves did not occur). Of the factors to which the response of 
the safety system of TTsNA units is foreseen (excessive rpm and 
temperature of the electric drive, oil system pressure), only a 
pressure drop in the oil system could have led to complete 
stoppage of the units. Establishment of this fact permits the 
assertion that the oil separation system was not set in its 
initial position, and gases passing through the oil tanks of the 
TTsNA from damaged compartment 7 caused foaming of the oil, 
which resulted in a pressure drop in the oil system's pressure 
line and activation of the emergency safety system of the units. 
Simultaneously, smoke gases carried oil vapor into the central 
passage of compartment 5, which was the cause of the 
deflagration within it. 
  However, there is one other side of the problem regarding 
the 
designer's mistake: Had the first and second crews of the 
submarine practiced damage control problems well, this design 
error would have been revealed right away, and corrected. 
  Analyzing the fire in compartment 5, we can make the 
following conclusions. 
  1. The color of the deflagration was bluish, which is a sign 
of an elevated oxygen concentration in the compartment. 
  2. The deflagration did not start a fire in the compartment, 
which says something about the rather high fire resistance of 
the ``Komsomolets'' submarine. 
  3. After their use, the hoses of the air-foam fire 
extinguishing system were left with open valves, which in the 
absence of people in compartment 5 led for practical purposes to 
this system's failure. 
<H5>  ``Shut Subgroup Valves!'' </H5>
  The fire in compartment 7, which was fed by air from 
high-pressure air cofferdams No. 1, 3 and 4, continued. The 
quantity of air entering compartment 7 exceeded the quantity of 
air bled overboard, and pressure in compartments 6 and 7 
continued to grow. Leaking of hydraulic pipes in compartment 7 
led to loss of fluid from the ship hydraulic system. 
  From the ship's log: 
  ``1145--Three distress signals transmitted. No 
acknowledgement.[.sup]35[/] Diesel cooling system not 
working. Shut off diesel. Establish communication with chemical 
service chief. 
  1146--Report temperature in compartment 5. 
  1147--Diesel stopped. Lines of defense in compartment 
4-- fore, aft bulkheads. In 3--fore bulkhead.'' 
  As was said above, Captain Lieutenant Dvorov's report of the 
deflagration in compartment 5 was received. The submarine 
command designated new lines of defense. In this case an order 
was apparently given from the attack center to compartment 5 
personnel to move to compartment 5. This can be the only 
explanation for designating the lines of defense in compartment 
4 and for the next entry in the ship's log: 
  ``1158--No communication with 4. Approximately nine men 
in 4.'' 
  This order to personnel of compartment 5 was not received, 
or 
it could not be carried out because the airlock door was jammed. 
  From the ship's log: 
  ``1150--Find what's wrong with the diesel's cooling 
system! Order from the commander: Summon the ship's surgeon to 
the control room, and calculate the time of relief of pressure 
from compartment 6. 13 atmospheres in compartment 6. 
  1153--Markov to find out what's wrong with the diesel's 
cooling pump power supply.'' 
  At 1150 the pressure in compartments 6 and 7 was equal to 13 
kg/cm[.sup]2[/], compared to a 10 kg/cm[.sup]2[/] design 
strength of the bulkheads. This was the first and last entry 
concerning pressure in the compartments in which specific values 
were indicated. The pressure probably continued to grow for some 
time more in the compartments. The decision to calculate the 
time of relief of pressure in the distressed compartments sounds 
very strange. A process of change in pressure in the distressed 
compartments was proceeding out of the control of the attack 
center. The attack center did nothing to contain and stop this 
process, but it did perform calculations having no practical 
value. In addition it would have been naive to suppose that the 
watchstander for compartment 6 might still have been alive at 
this time. 
  Lieutenant A. V. Zaytsev (explanatory note): ``The 
BCh-5 commander suggested relieving pressure through the salvage 
line. But it was already too late for me to do this, because the 
systems controlling and monitoring the positions of fittings in 
compartments 6 and 7 were out.'' 
  One could have tried to relieve pressure from compartments 6 
and 7 (with regard for possible loss of air-tightness of the 
rubber-coated metal branch nozzle in compartment 7) through the 
pipeline through successive work of the main bilge pumps by 
opening the valve and kingston valve in compartment 3 manually. 
But in order to make this decision, one had to have a good 
knowledge of the ship's pumping and salvage systems. In this 
particular situation of inactivity, forcing reduction of 
pressure in compartments 6 and 7 would have led to the earlier 
demise of the submarine. 
  The command to prepare for start-up of the diesel generator 
was given at 1117. Thirty-six minutes went by, and the personnel 
were unable to start the diesel generator's cooling pump. The 
reason is simple: The diesel generator's distribution panel 
receives power from distribution panel RShchN No 7, which was 
deenergized by personnel of compartment 2 in response to the 
command ``Damage control alarm! Fire in compartment 3!''. Under 
these conditions it would have been sufficient to awaken the 
generator, and the cooling pump would have been started off of 
the diesel generator itself. The crew's poor knowledge of the 
material was the reason why the diesel generator was stopped. 
  From the ship's log: 
  ``1156--Pressure concentration in compartment 6 being 
relieved. VII. (Sic.--D.R.). No information on pressure, 
temperature in 7, no communication. 
  1157--Seaman Filippov feeling poorly. Sent up. 
  1158--All who have communication, contact the control 
room. Air bleeding in compartment 3. The reason, oh boy, not yet 
determined (Sic.--D.R.). Shut down cofferdam high-pressure air 
valves, close subgroup valves in 1. No communication with 4. 
Approximately nine men in 4.'' 
  Thus the start of the decline in pressure in compartments 6 
and 7 was recorded at 1156. The maximum pressure they 
experienced is unknown. 
  Captain Lieutenant A. G. Verezgov (interrogation tape 
recording): ``...Dvorov told me as he was going up that the 
pressure in compartment 6 was 15 kilograms.'' 
  It is fully possible that the pressure in the distressed 
compartments attained 15 kg/cm[.sup]2[/]. As a result of the 
inactivity of the attack center, according to tentative 
calculations around 6,500 kilograms of air entered compartment 7 
from the high-pressure air system in the time from 1106 to 
1158-- that is, in 52 minutes. This was 20 times greater than 
the volume of the compartment. A kind of ``blast furnace'' was 
created in the compartment--30 to 40 times more powerful than 
the maximum possible fire under ordinary conditions. Tentative 
calculations show that the average temperature within the volume 
of compartment 7 may have been around 800-900C. This means 
that in the upper part of compartment 7, where the cable 
lead-ins are located, the temperature was high enough to melt 
aluminum and copper alloys, while in certain places the pressure 
hull's metal may have heated to the recrystalization point. Hot 
gases from the starboard main ballast tank No. 10 and from the 
fire in compartment 7 caused leaking through the cable lead-ins 
of the starboard reserve propulsion system. 
  Where did the pressure from compartment 6 and 7 go? As was 
said earlier, the pressure was bled into other compartments of 
the submarine through the oxygen dispensing and carbon dioxide 
removing lines of the air regenerating system, through the air 
line of the trim system, through the high-pressure air fitting 
remote control pipeline, through the drain line of the hydraulic 
system, and through the system of seals on the TTsNA turbopump 
unit. In addition hot gases escaped through the emergency 
blowing pipe into the starboard main ballast tank No. 10. At 
this time new pathways for gas to escape from compartment 7 
appeared. The operator of the main propulsion unit console had 
not closed the kingston valve of the cooling system of the 
stern-tube gland (when reactor power is limited to 30 percent, 
the cooling system does not influence the submarine's power, and 
in accordance with Article 91 of the RBZh- PL-82 it should have 
been inactivated without orders). The fire caused leaking and 
burning of the rubberized metal nozzle of the stern-tube gland's 
cooling system. Gases began passing from compartment 7 into the 
heated nozzle, and escaped overboard through the open kingston 
valve and the coil of the stern-tube gland's cooling system. The 
hot gases ``eroded'' the gasket on the cable lead-ins of the 
starboard reserve propulsion system, and began escaping into the 
starboard main ballast tank No. 10. The port cable lead-ins did 
not lose their airtightness, because the port ballast tank No. 
10 was filled with water, which provided for intensive cooling 
of the gasket. 
  At this moment another incompetent decision is made in the 
attack center. Rather than shutting the 200 kg/cm[.sup]2[/] 
air pressure line, the outboard air line and the medium-pressure 
air line passing into the aft compartments (three valves had to 
be shut in compartment 3), the command was given to close the 
subgroup valves at high-pressure air cofferdam No. 1, located in 
compartment 1, and at high-pressure air cofferdam No. 3, located 
in compartment 3. This is the only interpretation that can be 
given to the entry in the ship's log: ``Shut down cofferdam 
high-pressure air valves, close subgroup valves in 1.'' 
  In this case they apparently wanted to write the amount of 
air remaining in these cofferdams in the ship's log, but for 
some reason they were unable to do so. From the explanatory 
reports: 
  Warrant Officer V. S. Kadantsev: ``I shut the subgroup 
valves of cofferdam 3 on orders from the BCh-5 commander.'' 
  Warrant Officer Yu. N. Anisimov: ``The sound of 
high-pressure air bleeding could be heard during the alarm, the 
subgroup valves of cofferdams 1, 2 and 3 were shut on orders 
from the TsP.'' 
  And once again Warrant Officer V. S. Kadantsev 
(interrogation tape recording): ``In closing the valves of 
cofferdam 3, I discovered that the pipelines from high-pressure 
air to medium- pressure air and from the VZU regulator were 
frosted over. Air was bleeding into the stern from the VVD-400 
system through the regulator. I shut the subgroup valves at 
cofferdam 3, and pressure in it remained at 80 kilograms.'' 
  After fulfilling the command of the attack center to close 
the high-pressure air subgroup valves, the submarine was left 
without air, and for practical purposes without damage control 
resources. 
  Warrant Officer A. P. Kozhanov (explanatory report): 
``You could hear the ballast being blown, and we realized that 
the submarine had surfaced (we understood this from the depth 
gauge and from the rocking), after that the whistling of air 
could be heard for some time longer, after which we could see 
from the pressure gauges that high-pressure air cofferdams 1, 3 
and 4 were completely discharged. In response to a command from 
the TsP we attempted to recharge the fore VPL station, but we 
were unable to do this because of the absence of air in the 
system.'' 
  And that's not all. Personnel of compartments 2 and 3 as 
well 
as two persons in compartment 5 were connected up to ShDA 
apparatus of the stationary breathing system. The attack center 
had to know this, and when it gave the order to shut the 
high-pressure air subgroup valves, the submarine's leadership 
was cutting off, in the direct meaning of this word, oxygen to 
people connected to ShDA apparatus. And it was not long before 
this mistake was paid for. 
<H5>  Reconnaissance </H5>
  From the ship's log: 
  ``1206--Captain 3d Rank Yudin and Lieutenant Tretyakov 
are in compartment 4. Yudin connected up to an IP-6 at 1200. 
Lieutenant Tretyakov connected up to an IP-6 at 1206.'' 
  Forty-five minutes had passed after the last message was 
received from compartment 4, and not less than 20 minutes after 
the report from compartment 5 on the deflagration, but a group 
of scouts was not sent to compartment 4 until 1206. An 
unforgivable delay! After all, the command to prepare the damage 
control party was given back at 1110. Apparently the fight to 
correct the listing swallowed up the time and all of the crew's 
efforts. The damage control division commander went on 
reconnaissance, as if he had no other duties. The cause of the 
submarine's listing to port seemed completely clear, there were 
no problems with main ballast tank No. 5, the sources of smoke 
entering compartments 2 and 3 were determined and shut, steps 
were taken to replenish the high- pressure air reserves, the 
cause of the pressure drop in the distressed compartments had 
been clarified, the draft, trim and longitudinal stability of 
the submarine had been determined, the damage control plan was 
ready, and all tasks facing the damage control division 
commander regarding the accident, as prescribed to him by 
Article 45 of the RBZh-PL-82, had been carried out. But an order 
had been given, and had to be carried out. Captain 3d Rank Yudin 
went on reconnaissance. Obviously this was the sole person in 
the crew who knew the submarine well. 
  From the ship's log: 
  ``1207--Communication established with compartment 2. 6 
gm/liter in 2--14 men. Connected to SIZ (ShDA),[.sup]36[/] 
feeling satisfactory.'' 
  The carbon monoxide concentration in compartment 2 was 6 
gm/m[.sup]3[/] (there is an error in the ship's log). The 
personnel were connected up to ShDA apparatus. And although they 
were feeling satisfactory for the moment, they were already 
breathing poisoned air from compartment 7. They knew in the 
control room that people in compartment 2 were connected up to 
the system, to which no air was being supplied, but they didn't 
give the order to switch to other individual protective 
equipment. The same thing was also happening with the people in 
compartment 3, who were wearing ShDA apparatus. 
  From the ship's log: 
  ``1210--Eight distress signals transmitted, no 
acknowledgements. 
  With what words can we comment on this entry, so full of 
tragedy? The situation was desperate. The raging firestorm had 
engulfed four of seven compartments. There had been no 
communication with them for as much as around an hour, and what 
was going on in the compartments was unknown. The level of smoke 
in two of the three remaining compartments was at its maximum. 
It was impossible to start the electric exhaust fan and vent 
compartments 2 and 3. The diesel generator had still not been 
started, and it had not taken on a load. The electric capacity 
of the batteries is not infinite. It would not be long before 
the submarine would find itself without electric power, and 
consequently without communication with the outside world. 
Practically the entire reserve of high-pressure air--the 
principal means of damage control and of maintaining the 
submarine's stability--was gone. Because of the absence of high- 
pressure air, the air-foam fire extinguishing system was 
inactive. It was time to transmit an SOS signal. Had it been 
transmitted at this time, the tender ``Aleksey Khlobystov'' 
could have reached the site of the accident before the 
submarine's demise, and most of the crew would have been saved. 
  But the submarine's leadership apparently did not have 
enough 
courage to adopt an untraditional decision, and radio the 
distress signal in uncoded text. And this is understandable--we 
fear our leadership more than any accident. For such initiative, 
the submarine command would have received harsh treatment, 
despite the fact that there's no official prohibition on 
transmitting an SOS. 
  From the ship's log: 
  ital&gt; 1210--Oil spots on starboard side in vicinity of 7, air 
being bled (from bridge).'' 
  Pressure was dropping in compartments 6 and 7. Air escaped 
from them together with combustion products through the 
starboard main ballast tank No. 10 and the cooling kingston 
valve of the stern-tube gland, which is confirmed by the report 
from the fore bridge. 
  Captain Lieutenant A. G. Verezgov (interrogation tape 
recording): ``And then air started coming out, as if they were 
blowing No. 10 on the starboard side. A large bubble came up 
from starboard.'' 
  Question: ``At what time?'' 
  Answer: ``It's hard to say. My impression is that this 
was happening the whole time. A bubble would escape periodically 
over the course of 2-3 hours.'' 
  From the ship's log: 
  ``1211--Situation normal in 1. Hydrogen, oxygen and 
carbon dioxide normal, condition of personnel good. 
  1212--Golovchenko, Krasnov lost consciousness in 
compartment 2. Switch them to IDA,[.sup]37[/] turn on oxygen 
bottle (order from TsP). Open intake in 3. 
  1215--Move unconscious personnel of compartment 2 up. 
VSK[.sup]38[/] ready to take on four men.'' 
  The poisoned air in compartment 7 did its deed: People 
connected up to the ShDA apparatus began losing consciousness. A 
general command to use other breathing equipment in place of the 
ShDA apparatus was not forthcoming. An attempt was made to 
prepare compartment 2 for venting, for which purpose an order 
was given to shut the clack valves controlling intake 
ventilation between compartments 2 and 3. A command to prepare 
the rescue chamber for oxygen decompression treatment was given 
in this same period. 
  Warrant Officer V. S. Kadantsev: ``Before leaving for 
compartment 4 as ordered by the attack center, I prepared the 
rescue chamber for oxygen decompression treatment'' (explanatory 
report). 
  ``The two bottles in the rescue chamber are not enough 
for oxygen decompression treatment. To do this, we connect a 
rubberized metal hose from the 200-kilogram pressure air line 
through the shaft nozzle. After I did this, I was in the TsP'' 
(interrogation tape recording). 
  The submarine had a single free exit up through the hatch of 
the rescue chamber. Under these conditions the decision to 
prepare the rescue chamber for oxygen decompression treatment 
within it was absolutely wrong. Things did not go farther than 
the preparations. Apparently the submarine's leadership itself 
came to understand the absurdity of this undertaking. But 
preparation of the chamber for oxygen decompression treatment in 
it had further consequences. 
  A report came in from compartment 1. How sharply it 
contrasts 
with the situation in the other compartments! 
  Warrant Officer Yu. N. Anisimov (explanatory report): 
``I heard the damage control alarm while in the washroom in 
compartment 2. In an instant I was in compartment 1, as per the 
emergency bill. I closed the starboard valve supplying oxygen to 
the compartment, and the carbon dioxide valve, sealed off the 
carbon dioxide absorption apparatus, and stopped the fans of the 
battery venting system. Captain Lieutenant Speranskiy used a 
hydroelectric manipulator to close the bulkhead clack valves, 
and Warrant Officer Kozhanov began preparing the ShDA apparatus 
and deenergized electrical equipment not affecting the 
submarine's power and control.'' 
  No more need be said. 
  From the ship's log: 
  ``1218--Personnel in instrument enclosure of 
compartment 4 kor. R. [transliteration] Personnel can't get out 
of instrument enclosure. Yudin, Tretyakov got out. Men in 
airlock in compartment 5 can't open doors. Krasnov, Golovchenko 
raised to VSK. Grundul came up on his own. Measure gas 
composition in 2, 3. Pressure measured in 4, 5, get personnel 
out. Warrant Officer Kadantsev...connected to IDA 20 minutes. 
Open hatches of compartments 4 and 5. Udovl. 
[transliteration]'' 
  Lieutenant A. V. Tretyakov (interrogation tape 
recording): ``Went with Yudin to scout compartment 4. The status 
of compartment 4: high level of smoke and gas, moved around by 
touch. Pressure was high in the instrument enclosure of 
compartment 4 and in compartment 5, and the doors would not 
open.'' 
  Apparently compartment 4 was under some pressure, which was 
relieved as the scouts entered. This can be the only explanation 
for the higher pressure in the instrument enclosure as compared 
to atmospheric pressure, and for the high gas level in the 
compartment. After pressure was relieved from the compartment, 
the instrument enclosure's evacuating compressor turned on 
automatically, and it was impossible to enter the enclosure 
until this pressure was relieved. The scouts also relieved 
pressure from compartment 5. The bulkhead door into compartment 
5 was closed, but the door to the airlock of this compartment 
could not be opened because it was stuck as a result of the 
deflagration that occurred in the compartment. 
  Three men who had been poisoned by carbon monoxide in 
compartment 2 were delivered to the rescue chamber. 
  Pressure was relieved from compartments 4 and 5, and Yudin, 
Tretyakov and Kadantsev were ordered to get the people out of 
them. The abbreviation ``kor. R.'' apparently means ``on the 
reactor shell,'' and ``Udovl.'' refers to the satisfactory 
condition of the members of the damage control party. 
  From the ship's log: 
  ``1225--Acknowledgement to distress signal received. 
Get thermal underwear topside.'' 
  A message that the distress signal had been received and 
decoded was finally received! Sixty-seven minutes had passed 
after the distress signal was ready for transmission and 48 
minutes after it was transmitted the first time. 
  Such is the efficiency of the work of the navy's 
communication structures. 
  Poisoned crewmembers were taken to the conning tower 
superstructure, and thermal underwear was brought up for them. 
<H5>  Secret Documents--To the Rescue Chamber! </H5>
  From the ship's log: 
  ``1230--Seaman Filippov connected up to IDA-59. Check 
out compartment 3.'' 
  Warrant Officer V. F. Slyusarenko (explanatory report): 
``Then I saw Seaman Filippov, who ran over carrying an IDA-59. 
He was connected up to a PDU,[.sup]39[/] and he tried to 
switch over to the IDA-59, but his hands were shaking, and he 
didn't know what to do to put it on. I helped him switch over 
from the PDU to the IDA-59. After this he hurried over to 
prepare the diesel generator for starting in the hold of 
compartment 3.'' 
  Such was Seaman Filippov's effort in putting on the IDA-59. 
Who was supposed to be responsible for such crew training? 
  From the ship's log: 
  ``1233--Two men transferred from compartment 4: 
Makhota, Valyavin. Went topside.'' 
  Warrant Officer V. S. Kadantsev (explanatory report): 
``After the fire in compartment 4, the personnel of this 
compartment took shelter in the instrument enclosure. A damage 
control party consisting of damage control division commander 
Captain 3d Rank Yudin, me and Lieutenant Tretyakov was created 
for their evacuation. We put on our IP-6's and left for 
compartment 4. The compartment was extremely smoky. The damage 
control division commander opened the airlock to the instrument 
enclosure and went in, closing the door behind him. At this time 
I checked the compartment's readiness for venting into the 
atmosphere. Rapping could be heard from compartment 5. Opening 
the bulkhead door leading to compartment 5, I entered the 
compartment 5 airlock, but I couldn't open the airlock door. I 
couldn't do it together with the damage control division 
commander either.'' 
  Lieutenant A. V. Makhota (interrogation tape 
recording): ``The first party of scouts couldn't open us up. The 
second party did, obviously because the evacuating compressors 
were working (they were relieving pressure). We donned our PDU's 
and left compartment 3, and we were led up to the 
superstructure.'' 
  Owing to the aggressive actions taken by Captain 3d Rank 
Yudin, it was possible to lead the personnel of compartment 4 
out of the radio room. At this time the readiness of the fourth 
compartment for venting into the atmosphere was checked. But 
another 2 hours 24 minutes passed before venting of the 
compartment was started. There is no justification for the delay. 
  From the ship's log: 
  ``1235--Smoky in VTsK. Filippov. Report gas composition 
of 2. Take SPS[.sup]40[/] documents up to VSK (commander's 
order). Entry of smoke into compartment 3 stopped. 3 
gm/m[.sup]3[/] in compartment 2 (initially through the ShDA). 
Compartment 3 inspected. High smoke content in TsVK, no open 
flames.'' 
  By this time the fire in compartments 6 and 7 had apparently 
gone out. The pressure in them continued to fall, and by 1235 it 
decreased to 3 kg/cm[.sup]2[/]. The safety valves of the trim 
system's air line stopped bleeding air together with combustion 
products out of compartment 7 into compartment 3. Entry of smoke 
into compartment 3 diminished abruptly, which is noted in the 
ship's log. Still, air continued to enter compartment 3 through 
other unclosed pipelines, albeit in small quantities. Poisoned 
air was entering from the air console [?; vozdushnyy pult] of 
the high- pressure air fitting control system, located in the 
TsVK compartment. 
  Warrant Officer V. S. Kadantsev (interrogation tape 
recording): ``The smoke level in the aft section was very high, 
and a large amount of air was being bled (from the far left 
manipulator) from the main air console. The entire interior of 
the air console, where all of the pipes connect to 45 
kg/cm[.sup]2[/], and all of the pipes were sprayed with dirty 
soot.'' 
  Once again Seaman Filippov! 
  Lieutenant A. V. Tretyakov (explanatory report): ``In 
compartment 3, the executive officer gave orders to inspect the 
hold, and to find seamen Mikhalev and Filippov. We checked the 
hold, and reported through Lieutenant Fedotko that neither was 
there.'' 
  At this moment Seaman Filippov, who had donned his IDA-59, 
returned to the hold of compartment 3 and was helping to start 
the diesel generator. 
  The attack center's supposition that fires were burning in 
compartment 3 was not confirmed. Venting of compartments 2 and 3 
had not yet been started because of the absence of power at 
distribution panel RShchN No 7, which is why the amount of smoke 
in the compartments remained high. The carbon monoxide 
concentration in air of compartment 2 exceeded the maximum 
permissible concentration by over 600 times. The concentration 
of carbon monoxide in compartment 3 could not be measured 
because of the absence of measuring equipment. 
  Warrant Officer V. F. Slyusarenko (explanatory report): 
``The submarine commander gave orders to measure the CO 
concentration in the compartment. I took the measurements with a 
PGA- VPM[.sup]41[/] for low concentrations, because I 
couldn't find any indicator tubes for high concentrations; the 
limit for low concentrations was 50 mg/m[.sup]3[/], and the 
tube showed much more. I reported this.'' 
  What was the estimate of the accident situation during this 
period by the submarine's leadership? 
  Captain 1st Rank B. G. Kolyada (interrogation tape 
recording): ``According to the BCh-5 commander's calculations, 
in the worst-case scenario--flooding of the aft 
compartments--the submarine would lose stability by 1500. The 
command ``Prepare for evacuation to approaching vessels'' was 
given.'' 
  Nothing was known about how things stood with evacuation of 
people, but at this time the submarine commander gave orders to 
evacuate secret business documents, which was documented in the 
ship's log. 
  Warrant Officer E. D. Kononov (explanatory report): 
``In response to a command from the control room I went to the 
control room, and then took the documents up into the rescue 
chamber on the commander's orders.'' 
  Later on Captain 1st Rank Kolyada talked long and often 
about 
the submarine's demise being a surprise to the crew, which is 
why the personnel were unable to make full use of rescue 
resources. The ship's demise was in fact a surprise to most of 
the crew. On the other hand the leadership was excellently aware 
of the impending danger, and it was only its indecision that led 
to numerous sacrifices. 
  Such are the facts. 
<H5>  The First Victims </H5>
  From the ship's log: 
  ``1241--Yudin, Kadantsev, Tretyakov came out. High 
smoke level in compartment 4. 
  1245--Exhaust system clack valves opened between 
compartments 2 and 3. Ventilation clack valves of intake system 
between compartments 2 and 3 opened.'' 
  Warrant Officer V. F. Slyusarenko (interrogation tape 
recording): ``I handed the wrench to the executive officer to 
open the vent between compartments 2 and 3. The executive 
officer opened them himself, and I was ordered to open the 
intake ventilation system. I opened it.'' 
  Thirty minutes had passed from the moment the command to 
open 
the clack valves was given. 
  From the ship's log: 
  ``1248--In 1: hydrogen--0.4, oxygen--23 percent. 
Situation normal. Radio room inspected. No remarks. VVD-200 
disconnect closed in 1. No information from 5. 
  1253--VVD-200 disconnected at stern and at bow. 
  1255--Makhota connected up to IP-6. Valyavin in IDA-59, 
going to 4, 5. Warrant Officer Gerashchenko feels poorly in VSK. 
Airlock window broken to equalize pressure with compartment 5. 
  1300--Count all men. VVD-200 regulator charged. Diesel 
ready for starting.'' 
  Everything was in order in compartment 1. The concentration 
of hydrogen and oxygen was within normal. Prior to loading, the 
200 kg/cm[.sup]2[/] air main was cut off at the stern to 
avoid bleeding of air into compartment 7, and at the same time 
it was cut off at the bow as well. A necessary measure, but a 
little too late. 
  Warrant Officer V. S. Kadantsev (explanatory report): 
``On orders from the BCh-5 commander, I cut off the subgroup 
valves of cofferdam 3 and closed the disconnect valves for the 
VVD-200 system in compartment 3 and in compartment 2. After this 
I charged the regulator for the VVD-200 system from cofferdam 2, 
and supplied air to the VVD-200 system. The diesel generator 
started right away.'' 
  This is the explanation given by Warrant Officer Kadantsev, 
the chief of mechanics, for all of the manipulations with the 
200 kg/cm[.sup]2[/] air main. And we could have agreed with 
this, if this main were used to start the diesel generator. But 
actually the diesel generator is started by self-contained 
bottles or by the 400 kg/cm[.sup]2[/] main. And as we can 
see, all of the entries in the ship's log regarding VVD-200 
confirm in writing the submarine personnel's poor knowledge of 
its material. 
  Lieutenant A. V. Makhota (explanatory report): ``Then 
the two of us were summoned to the control room, and we were 
ordered to connect up to IP-6's, leave for compartment 4 and 
help the personnel in compartment 5. On reaching compartment 4 
we entered the airlock between compartments 4 and 5. The airlock 
door would not open, it was stuck. Then we kicked it open and 
helped six men get out.'' 
  Warrant Officer V. S. Kadantsev (interrogation tape 
recording): ``The BCh-5 commander sent two new scouts there and 
told them to break the glass in the airlock door to compartment 
5 in any way possible (perhaps there was pressure in there). 
When they broke the glass, this didn't do anything to make it 
easier to open the door--that is, there was no pressure in 
compartment 5. The door was kicked in.'' 
  Because the power supply to the fan of the main ventilation 
ring was switched off, instruments of the navigation system 
began failing due to overheating. 
  Warrant Officer A. M. Kopeyka (interrogation tape 
recording): ``There was no smoke in the gyro-compass room. 
Everything was working normally. I checked all of the units and 
went to report to the team chief that we were not going to have 
any problems with the power supply. The second ventilation ring 
was working poorly. We requested power several times from 
compartment 2, but the BCh-5 commander said that they couldn't 
deal with this now, and to do everything we could. It was after 
I dragged the team chief up after he started feeling poorly that 
the command to measure CO in the compartments was 
transmitted.'' 
  The electrical navigation group tried to do everything 
possible to prolong the work of the navigation system with the 
ventilation system not working. In order to improve cooling the 
panels were removed from their pedestals, but it was all in 
vain. It would have been much easier to supply power to the 
electric fan of the cooling system, or to shut off the system 
right away. 
  Warrant Officer V. V. Gerashchenko (interrogation tape 
recording): ``I disconnected the ``Magistral'' system. I was 
feeling bad, I began to see brown spots before my eyes, my 
vision began to go dark, and I had an intense headache. Warrant 
Officer Kopeyka noted this, tore the ShDA mask off of me, and 
helped me topside.... I began to feel better after 40-50 
minutes, and I asked to be allowed to go back down.... I looked 
over the gyro-compass room and concluded that we had to shut 
everything down, because the instruments and the internal 
cabling could catch fire.'' 
  The navigation system was soon shut down. 
  After Warrant Officer Gerashchenko was poisoned a command 
was 
given to personnel in compartment 3 to switch from the ShDA to 
other individual protective equipment. 
  It is hard to understand the entry in the ship's log that 
there was no information from compartment 5. The control room 
knew that people were in there, and that they could not open the 
airlock door. To get the door open, a command to break the glass 
in the airlock to equalize pressure in compartment 5 was given, 
despite the fact that there was ``No information from 
compartment 5.'' Lieutenant Makhota and Warrant Officer Valyavin 
were sent to compartment 5 without spare individual protective 
equipment. 
  From the ship's log: 
  ``1305--Diesel water drain working. Taken out of 
compartment 5: Volkov--1, Tkachev--2, Kozlov--3, Dvorov--4, 
Zamogilnyy--5, Shostak--6. Kulapin in 5 connected up to ShDA. He 
has no IDA. Alive. 
  1308--Connected up to ShDA in compartment 5--Bondar on 
port side. Six men from 5--topside. Pered. [?; probably an 
abbreviation]. 
  1307--Dvorov, Makhota--to 5 after Kulapin and Bondar. 
Connected up to IP-6's. Valyavin arrived from 5, carried Bondar 
and Kulapin to airlock. Moderate smoke level in compartment 5. 
Valyavin went topside.'' 
  Six men were taken out of compartment 5; the numbers after 
their names indicate the order in which the people were taken 
out of the compartment. It is not entirely clear why the entry 
in the ship's log for 1308 was ahead of the entry for 1307. 
  Warrant Officer Bondar and Seaman Kulapin, who were 
connected 
up to ShDA equipment, remained in compartment 5. 
  There is an inaccuracy in the ship's log: Warrant Officer 
Valyavin only tried to carry Kulapin over, but he was unable to 
do this. 
  Lieutenant A. V. Tretyakov (explanatory report): 
``Warrant Officer Valyavin reported that he had tried to drag 
Seaman Kulapin out of the compartment, but he was so heavy and 
Valyavin was feeling so poorly that he was unable to do this 
alone.'' 
  Captain Lieutenant S. A. Dvorov (explanatory report): 
``About 1.5 hours later the airlock door was opened from 
compartment 4, and we were taken into compartment 3. I put on a 
new IP-6 and once again left for compartment 5 with two IP-6s to 
evacuate Seaman Kulapin and Warrant Officer Bondar, who were 
connected to the ShDA. They were found unconscious in 
compartment 5. Warrant Officer Valyavin and I carried them into 
compartment 3.'' 
  The impression is created that in his position as 
compartment 
commander, during his presence in compartment 5 Captain 
Lieutenant Dvorov had not monitored the condition of people 
connected to ShDA apparatus. It is unclear from his explanations 
whether attempts were made to put IP-6 face masks on Warrant 
Officer Bondar and Seaman Kulapin. In addition, not only Captain 
Lieutenant Dvorov and Warrant Officer Valyavin but also Captain 
3d Rank Yudin, lieutenants Tretyakov, Makhota and Fedotko, 
Warrant Officer Slyusarenko and Senior Seaman Vershilo helped to 
evacuate these people. It should be noted in this case that the 
submarine command, which knew that there were still two people 
connected up to ShDA apparatus in compartment 5, was unable to 
organize a larger damage control party for simultaneous 
evacuation of the victims. The two persons sent to compartment 5 
were unable to carry two out right away. 
  Electric power to the diesel generator's cooling pump was 
sorted out over an hour after the order was given. Power was 
supplied to distribution panel RShchN No. 7 from the 
unconnectable load section of the main distribution panel No. 1, 
located in compartment 2, and the electric cooling pump was 
started. Venting of compartment 3 with the exhaust fan of the 
forward ring of the general ship ventilation system was started 
simultaneously, although there are no entries to this effect in 
the ship's log. 
  Lieutenant A. V. Zaytsev (interrogation tape 
recording): ''Then we turned on the diesel engine and exhaust 
fans--air began flowing into the submarine.'' 
  From the ship's log: 
  ``1319--RDO[.sup]42[/] No. 12 transmitted. 
  1325--Definite acknowledgement to RDO No. 12 received. 
No information on Kolotilin, Bukhnikashvili, tentatively in 
compartment 6. 
  1327--Kulapin led out (Sic--D.R.) of 5. Communication 
session initiated. Personally addressed to us. No pulse felt on 
Kulapin, raised topside. 
  1333--Slyusarenko, Fedotko, Dvorov, Valyavin gone to 
stern. Load picked up by DG. 
  1339--Status of GEU: reactor stopped with all 
absorbers, AZ, KR, at lower limit switches. Loop 1 temperature 
75C, loop 1 pressure 105 kg/cm[.sup]2[/], level in KO 
3--19 percent, cooling proceeding through BBR system, 2 TsNPK 
working. GEU control totally absent. Kulapin has no pulse. 
  1340--Dvorov lost consciousness in compartment 3. 
Bondar in compartment 3 in airlock. 
  1341--No people in compartment 5. Compartment 5 
inspected. Valyavin, Slyusarenko, Fedotko, Vershilo came out. In 
compartment 1: Grigoryan, Anisimov, Kozhanov, Speranskiy. In 
compartment 2: Markov, Gregulev. Bondar came up (sick--D.R.) 
(unconscious).'' 
  The diesel generator (DG) picked up the load 2 hours 16 
minutes after the command was given. The reactor had been 
stopped with all absorbers (safety rods AZ and shim rods KR), 
which were resting on the lower limit switches, back at 1123; 
however, an entry to this effect was not made in the ship's log 
until 1339. According to the control log control of the main 
propulsion unit (GEU) was lost at 1119, with the exception of 
control over mechanisms and units of the reactor compartment. 
The ``Shtil'' system, which supported the reactor's emergency 
shielding, was working. The entry to this effect in the ship's 
log is imprecise. Accelerated cooling of the submarine's nuclear 
reactor by way of the battery-less cooling system (the BBR 
system) was proceeding with forced circulation of water in loop 
1 by the loop 1 circulating pumps (TsNPK). The ship's log 
entries regarding the loop 1 temperature and the water level in 
the volume compensator (KO), equal to 19 percent, indicate a 
high degree of reactor cooling. 
  The automatic system and equipment of the reactor 
compartment 
activated the emergency shielding, managed the reactor's steady 
cooling and monitored all of its parameters until the submarine 
went down. Evacuation of personnel from compartment 5 was 
completed. It took 36 minutes to evacuate two persons from 
compartment 5. Seaman Kulapin was raised up in 20 minutes. It 
took a larger damage control party only 8 minutes to evacuate 
Warrant Officer Bondar. There are full grounds for believing 
that the submarine command was unable to man large damage 
control parties. They were made up of only 11 men out of a crew 
of 69; in this case damage control division commander Captain 3d 
Rank Yudin was forced to go to the aft compartments eight times 
as a member of damage control parties. 
  Despite all of the efforts by Senior Lieutenant of Medical 
Service L. A. Zayts, Seaman Kulapin and Warrant Officer Bondar 
could not be saved. The possibility is not excluded that the 
mistakes made by the commander of compartment 5 and the delay of 
evacuation led to the tragic outcome. 
<H5>  Fight Against Listing Continues </H5>
  From the ship's log: 
  ``1344--Open valve to equalize pressure between 5 and 
6.'' 
  It should be noted that the term ``open valve'' could also 
be 
read as ``valve opened.'' Analysis of preceding and subsequent 
events permits us to assume that this was a command, but its 
execution was not documented. 
  Captain Lieutenant S. A. Dvorov (interrogation tape 
recording): ``Then I went back to compartment 5 and took another 
man with me--Warrant Officer Valyavin. The BCh-5 commander gave 
the command to open the bulkhead clack valves between 
compartments 5 and 4, and to seal off compartment 5 in order to 
relieve pressure from compartment 6. I was unable to open the 
bulkhead clack valves, because the bulkhead was very hot, and 
the high level of smoke was a hindrance. We found Bondar in a 
dead-end corridor on the left side at the bow. He was connected 
up to the ShDA and unconscious.'' 
  This was in the period between 1333 and 1340. Then the 
command to open the pressure equalizing valve was given. The 
command remained unexecuted. What was happening at this time in 
the submarine? Pressure was falling in compartments 6 and 7. 
Because of leaks in the pipelines, when the pressure dropped 
below 2 kg/cm[.sup]2[/] water began leaking from the air 
conditioning and cooling systems of ship power consumers. 
Apparently at around 1330 the operator of the ``Molibden'' 
console was forced to stop the pumps of the cooling system 
supporting ship power consumers (Lieutenant Zaytsev gives a time 
of 1230 in his explanatory report, which is not very probable). 
  A decision was made to relieve pressure from the distressed 
compartments by way of the exhaust main of the aft ventilation 
ring. This is the only interpretation that can be given to the 
command received by Captain Lieutenant Dvorov. How do we 
evaluate this decision? Pressure was falling in the distressed 
compartments. There was a report from the bridge that bleeding 
of air was observed from the right side in the vicinity of 
compartment 7. It may be concluded with certainty that the 
pressure hull of compartment 7 was no longer airtight. 
Consequently as soon as the pressure fell below a certain value, 
water would rush into the distressed compartment. And rather 
than implementing all measures to seal the bulkhead between 
compartments 5 and 6 (or between 4 and 5) and prepare to charge 
the distressed compartments, an attempt was undertaken to 
relieve pressure in them. A decision equivalent to suicide. 
Luckily it was impossible to carry it out--otherwise the 
submarine may have sunk an hour earlier, and no one would have 
been saved. 
  By 1200 the entire reserve of high-pressure air was 
exhausted, with the exception of the reserve in the commander's 
tank group, but no actions were taken to replenish it. Nor were 
any attempts made to find out what was happening in the aft part 
of the submarine, and what sort of change was occurring in draft 
and trim. 
  Senior Watch Officer Captain Lieutenant A. G. Verezgov 
(interrogation tape recording): 
  Question: ``And couldn't you have gone aft?'' 
  Answer: ``I thought about it, but no one went 
there.'' 
  RBZh-PL-82, Article 42: ``In case of accident the 
submarine senior watch officer is obligated: ...to directly lead 
the personnel's damage control efforts on the upper deck and in 
the superstructure when the submarine is on the surface.'' 
  More interrogation tape recordings: 
  Electrical navigation group engineer Lieutenant K. A. 
Fedotko: 
  Question: ``Was listing documented?'' 
  Answer: ``We had bigger problems--the ship was out of 
trim.'' 
  Damage control division engineer Lieutenant A. V. 
Zaytsev: ``According to the pressure gauges the pressure in 
compartments 6 and 7 reached zero. I reported this to the 
commander. It took a long time to relieve the pressure. I don't 
remember when pressure was bled from compartments 6 and 7, but I 
do remember that our trim was 1 aft at around 1300.'' 
  A correction needs to be made in Lieutenant Zaytsev's 
statement. The submarine had a zero trim by the stern as of 
1300. The trim appeared later. Here is how the fourth and 
seventh sections of the government commission's working group 
evaluated change in the submarine's draft and trim over time, on 
the basis of an analysis of photographs taken from an airplane: 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Time                     |Draft in Meters          |Trim by Stern in Degrees | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|1500                     |7.5-8.5                  |1.5-2.0                  | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|1600                     |8.5-9.0                  |2.0-2.5                  | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|1630                     |9.0-9.5                  |2.5-3.0                  | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|1645                     |9.5-10.0                 |3.0-3.5                  | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  We can see that change in draft and trim occurred gradually, 
and it could have been predicted beforehand. Therefore all of 
the assertions that appeared later in the press regarding the 
alleged unexpected demise of the submarine, which hindered 
preparation of rescue equipment, are inconsistent with reality, 
and have the goal of covering up the inactivity of the ship's 
leadership in rescuing the crew. 
  At this time events developed ashore in the following way. 
At 
1219 (and possibly even at 1141) the distress signal was 
decoded. At 1239 an IL-38 airplane was dispatched to the 
accident location, for some reason without a submarine 
specialist aboard. As a result the headquarters of the Northern 
Fleet was deprived of objective information up until the end of 
the tragedy, while the submarine was perhaps deprived of good 
recommendations that may have dramatically altered the 
subsequent progress of accident recovery efforts. 
  At 1250 the headquarters of the Northern Fleet transmitted a 
radio message to the ``Komsomolets'' forbidding the ship's 
submergence and suggesting it remain adrift. It was also 
communicated that an airplane was en route to the submarine with 
an estimated time of arrival of 1400. 
  Unfortunately the headquarters of the Northern Fleet did not 
furnish documents to the government commission's working group 
regarding communication exchanges between the distressed 
submarine and the fleet command post. The message cited above 
and subsequent ones are from a document of the fourth section of 
the government commission's working group, signed by Vice 
Admiral Zaytsev--the naval deputy commander-in-chief and the 
chairman of this section. 
  It may be concluded from the radio messages that the 
submarine command concealed the true scale of the accident from 
the headquarters of the Northern Fleet from the very beginning. 
For practical purposes there was no reserve of high-pressure air 
aboard the ship (except for the commander's tank group), it was 
dead in the water, and pressure in the distressed compartments 
was close to 13 kg/cm[.sup]2[/]. How could there be any talk 
of submerging the submarine in a disaster of such a scale? 
Apparently the command of the ``Komsomolets'' lacked not only 
the ability to organize ship damage control efforts but also the 
courage to report the status of the submarine objectively and 
promptly. 
  Twenty-three minutes (and possible even 61) had passed after 
the distress signal was decoded, and it was not until then that 
it came to the headquarters of the Northern Fleet to ask the 
Sevryba Association to report the location of its vessels. The 
time was 1242. A reply was received in the same minute. Another 
8 minutes went by, and finally at 1250 the headquarters of the 
Northern Fleet made the decision to send the tender ``Aleksey 
Khlobystov'' to the place of the accident. As a result the 
tender was unable to begin traveling to the coordinates 
indicated by the Northern Fleet headquarters until 1320. 
  The list to port was a constant concern to the submarine 
command. And as soon as rescue of people from compartments 4 and 
5 was finished, it set to correcting the list. 
  From the ship's log: 
  ``1354--Kadantsev--open vent valve of TsGB No. 7.'' 
  The side on which the vent valve had to be opened and the 
tank had to be filled was not indicated in the ship's log. But 
the reference is to the starboard main ballast tank No. 7. 
  Lieutenant A. V. Zaytsev (explanatory report): ``On 
orders from the BCh-5 commander Warrant Officer Kadantsev bled 
air out of the starboard main ballast tank No. 7. After this the 
list became 0.'' 
  Warrant Officer V. S. Kadantsev (interrogation tape 
recording): ``The BCh-5 commander ordered me to open the vent 
valve of number 7 on the right side in order to correct the 
list. I donned an IDA-59 and went to the aft ventilation 
enclosure of compartment 3, where I delivered (Kadantsev meant 
to say ``bled.''-- D.R.) batches of air. The list was corrected. 
The smoke level in the aft section was very high, and a great 
deal of air was bleeding out of the main air console (out of the 
far left manipulator).'' 
  Two and a half hours had gone by after the submarine 
surfaced. During this time the attack center could have 
ascertained that a list of 6-8 degrees is not dangerous to a 
submarine, and that it would make no sense to waste time and 
resources correcting it. Contrary to this, the submarine command 
stubbornly tried to correct the list, and in doing so, it used 
the most irrational method. Rather than filling one of the 
starboard bow tanks, a stern tank was filled. This diminished 
the buoyancy reserve, and did not improve the parameters of the 
ship's longitudinal stability. 
  The impression is created that the principle followed in 
flooding the main ballast tanks (first starboard No. 5 and then 
No. 7 on the same side) was not that of the greatest expediency 
but that of the possibility of subsequently blowing them with 
air reserves remaining in high-pressure air cofferdam No. 3. 
Bleeding of smoke gases from distressed compartments into 
compartments 2, 3 and 5 continued, and nothing was done to stop 
it. Despite the fact that ventilation was working in 
compartments 2 and 3, the carbon monoxide concentration in them 
exceeded the maximum permissible concentration by several times. 
  From the ship's log: 
  ``1355--Yudin, Apanasyevich, Tretyakov, Slyusarenko 
connected up to IP-6s. 
  1356--Slyusarenko, Tretyakov--safeties, Yudin, 
Apanasyevich-- damage control party in compartment 6. RDO No. 13 
transmitted.'' 
  A damage control party was sent to compartment 6. The goal 
of 
the patrol, as was said earlier, was to deliver fire 
extinguisher into compartment 7. But the reference is to 
something else. Sending the damage control party to compartment 
6 meant that in the opinion of the submarine command the fire 
had gone out in it, and pressure in the distressed compartments 
had fallen to a value close to 0. If we consider that pressure 
was measured with a pressure gauge having a scale reading from 0 
to 16 kg/cm[.sup]2[/] with a precision class of 2.5, then at 
1355 the pressure in the distressed compartments was close to 
0.5 kg/cm[.sup]2[/]. A qualitatively new stage had started. 
Bleeding of air out of the starboard main ballast tank No. 10 
was coming to an end. By this time, taking the actual draft of 
the submarine into account, the scupper grates of this tank were 
at a depth of 4.5-5 meters--that is, pressure in the distressed 
compartments was equal to the pressure in the main ballast tank. 
Soon air would begin passing from the starboard tank No. 10 
through the burnt-out cable lead-ins into compartment 7, and 
then from it into compartments 2, 3 and 5, and partially 
overboard through the cooling kingston valve and pipeline of the 
stern-tube gland. 
  The fire in the distressed compartment had gone out by this 
time. As was said earlier, around 6,500 kg of air had passed 
into the distressed compartments out of the high-pressure air 
system. Not more than 700 kg of fuel, expressed in units of 
carbon, could have burned in this quantity of air. Three hours 
would have been more than sufficient to burn this quantity of 
fuel in two fully involved compartments. 
  The organizational side of the preparation of the damage 
control party for its mission is astounding. The pressure in the 
distressed compartments was around 0.5 kg/cm[.sup]2[/], and 
it was pressing against the bulkhead door into compartment 6 
with a force of over 2,000 kilograms. The door opens into 
compartment 5. Had the damage control party been able to turn 
the rack-and-pinion and released the latch, this damage control 
party and its safeties would also have been killed by the door 
or by the air flow in fractions of a second. And it is difficult 
to say what other misfortunes would have come upon the submarine 
and its crew. But this is just one side of the issue. 
  Now let's imagine the compartment in which a fire of great 
intensity had just gone out. Everything was red hot. Nothing in 
it could be handled. Total darkness. A poisoned atmosphere. Each 
step is dangerous--the flooring could collapse, if it's still 
there. And here was the damage control party, without heat 
resistant overalls, wearing only IP-6 gas masks, making ready to 
enter this hell. Had the ship's leadership considered that by 
sending people into compartment 6 it was sending them to certain 
death? Quite clearly compartment 5 should have been sealed off 
and pressure in it should have been increased to that in the 
distressed compartments first, and only after this should the 
bulkhead door between compartments 5 and 6 been opened, and 
people dressed in heat resistant overalls and IDA-59s been sent 
into the distressed compartment. And four men were clearly not 
enough for this work. Moreover, whatever the case, there were no 
guarantees that the damage control party could fulfill its task. 
At this moment only one goal could have justified the risk of 
sending a damage control party into the distressed compartments: 
closing the cooling kingston valve of the stern-tube gland and 
opening the emergency pumping valve in compartment 6 or 7. It 
would have been much simpler and easier to seal off the aft 
compartments and maintain excess pressure in them. Unfortunately 
no one thought of this throughout the entire accident. 
  From the ship's log: 
  ``1357--Warrant Officer Kadantsev filled TsGB No. 7, 
closed vent valve. 
  1402--Kulapin and Bondar dead, doctor's conclusion. 
  1407--RDO No. 13 transmitted repeatedly. From moment of 
RDO No. 13 from first time. CO in hold of 2 5.6 
gm/m[.sup]3[/]. Smoke to starboard, at location of reversible 
VPR, visibility better to port. CO on middle deck 2-3 
gm/m[.sup]3[/].'' 
  The starboard main ballast tank No. 7 was flooded. The list 
was corrected, although this was not reflected in the ship's 
log. There is an oxygen dispenser near the location of the 400 
Hz converter (VPR) and the reversible converter. Smoke gases 
were passing from it into compartment 2. This entry in the 
ship's log is nothing other than written confirmation of the 
oxygen version of the cause of the fire. The oxygen delivery 
line in compartment 7 was open before the accident, and during 
the fire smoke gases entered through it into the oxygen header 
of the electrolytic unit, and then through the manually opened 
oxygen delivery line into compartment 2. In the meantime it is 
asserted in the explanatory reports submitted by Captain 
Lieutenant V. A. Gregulev 5 days after the interrogation that 
the oxygen delivery valves were closed at the header in 
compartment 2, and that the carbon dioxide main was shut. This 
is clearly inconsistent with reality. The region where smoke 
gases were bleeding was known, and still, nothing was done to 
stop the leaks. Hence the extremely high concentration of carbon 
monoxide in compartment 2, despite its continuing ventilation. 
  And what was meant by the unfinished phrase in the ship's 
log 
``From the moment of RDO No. 13 from first time'' is unclear. 
<H5>  ``No Water Entering!'' </H5>
  From the ship's log: 
  ``1412--Yudin, Fedotko, Slyusarenko, Apanasyevich 
arrived. Compartment 6 bulkhead temperature over 70C, entry 
impossible. 
  1415--IP-6s recharged, Yudin, Apanasyevich, Slyusarenko 
left for 5 to deliver LOKh into compartment 6. 
  1418--UKV [ultrashort-wave?] communication established 
with airplane. 
  1420--LOKh delivered to compartment 6 from 5. Captain 
3d Rank Yudin, Seaman Apanasyevich arrived, Warrant Officer 
Slyusarenko didn't go.'' 
  Warrant Officer V. F. Slyusarenko (interrogation tape 
recording): ``Then the executive officer ordered Yudin to 
deliver LOKh from compartment 5 into compartment 6. And he 
ordered me to go as a safety. They couldn't find anyone else, 
because practically the entire crew was topside. Warrant Officer 
Valyavin, who knows compartment 5 well, went below. Valyavin 
couldn't go because he had breathed in a lot of CO. He was 
forbidden to go. While they were searching for another man, 
Yudin had already gone down to compartment 5 and returned. I 
don't know whether or not Yudin delivered LOKh into compartment 
6 from compartment 5.'' 
  I have no desire to comment on the way the damage control 
parties were manned. Everything is clear without my saying 
anything. 
  Let's turn attention to the temperature of the fore bulkhead 
of compartment 6, and the time. At 1412 the bulkhead temperature 
was over 70C. It had to be estimated subjectively because 
the damage control party did not have any measuring instruments. 
It was said earlier that the fire was no longer burning in 
compartment 6, and delivery of LOKh into it made no practical 
sense. 
  From the ship's log: 
  ``1426--On the bridge: Move away from ``Ivolga'' for 
radio transmission. 
  1427--RDO No. 13 transmitted third time. Six RSP-30 
mm[.sup]43[/] handed up to bridge: 2 red, 2 green, 2 white. 
  1432--Av. stop. UKV [transliteration] ``Komar'' set at 
``beacon.'' 
  1440--Airplane sighted visually. Smoking, coming in 
from port, marking its location, four-engined. 
  1441--``Komar'' ``beacon'' switched on. 
IL-38--classified.'' 
  The airplane arrived in the accident region and established 
communication with the submarine, and the first photographs were 
taken. It was communicated from the airplane that surface ships 
would reach the submarine by 1800. At this time a query was 
transmitted to the submarine from Northern Fleet headquarters by 
way of the airplane regarding entry of water into the pressure 
hull and regarding the fire. The attention of the submarine 
command was simultaneously turned to the need for utilizing all 
possibilities of the LOKh system to deliver freon into 
compartments 6 and 7, to sealing off the aft compartments, to 
preventing gas contamination of the other compartments of the 
submarine, to continually monitoring the gas composition in the 
compartments and to making economical use of individual 
protective equipment. Having no information about the accident's 
development and the course of damage control measures, the 
Northern Fleet's command post was forced to transmit the set of 
typical recommendations known even to young seamen. 
  In the meantime the submarine began tipping to starboard as 
the starboard main ballast tank No. 10 filled. All of the effort 
to correct the listing to port turned out to be not only useless 
but even harmful. The buoyancy reserve was lost purposelessly. 
Water began entering compartment 7 through the cooling kingston 
valve of the stern-tube gland. A small patch of roiling water on 
the starboard side in the vicinity of the indicated kingston 
valve could be seen distinctly on a photograph taken from the 
airplane at 1440--this was air ``gurgling'' up from compartment 
7. There are no precise references to the time when the list 
began shifting to starboard and when filling of the starboard 
main ballast tank No. 10 finished. The testimony of the crew 
members is contradictory. 
  Warrant Officer V. S. Kadantsev (explanatory report): 
``In order to measure the temperature of the bulkhead between 
compartments 5 and 6, after compartments 4 and 5 were vented I 
left for compartment 5 and set a thermometer reading to 
100C on the aft bulkhead of compartment 5. The thermometer 
read a temperature above 100C--approximately 115-119C. 
At this time the trim was 1.5 by the stern. The list began 
changing to starboard.'' 
  According to the ship's log the time the temperature was 
measured was 1539. 
  Lieutenant A. V. Zaytsev (explanatory report): ``On 
orders from the BCh-5 commander Warrant Officer Kadantsev bled 
air out of the starboard TsGB No 7. After this the list became 
0, and then shifted over to starboard, becoming 4-5 to 
starboard.... At around 1400 the starboard main ballast tank No. 
7 was blown with air remaining in high-pressure air cofferdam 
No. 3. The list became equal to 0.'' 
  It may be surmised from Lieutenant Zaytsev's explanatory 
report that listing had shifted to starboard back before 1400. 
But this could not have been, because the starboard main ballast 
tank No. 7 was not flooded until 1357, and it could not have 
been blown at 1400. Analysis of photographs taken from the 
airplane permits the assertion that the starboard tank No. 10 
was flooded at around 1500, and water rushed into compartment 7 
through the cable lead-ins. 
  From the ship's log: 
  ``1442--Yudin, Ispenkov connected up to IP-6. Going to 
compartment 5 to stop reversible, check temperature of 
compartment 6 fore bulkhead. 
  1445--Reversible of 5 stopped. Airplane dropped a buoy. 
  1449--CO at bulkhead at aft end of compartment 3--5 
mg/m[.sup]3[/]. IP recharging station deployed. Spent PDUs, 
IPs tossed overboard (regenerating cartridges).'' 
  The diesel generator had now been carrying a load for over 
an 
hour. Two reversible converters were working, which was 
redundant to a certain degree. With the automatic controls of 
the electric power system working, the reversible converter 
could have been stopped from the control console, while when the 
``Sinus'' system was deenergized, it could be stopped only from 
the local control post in compartment 5. Sending a special 
damage control party to compartment 5 for this purpose is 
unconvincing, because there was no urgent need to stop it, and 
moreover, under these circumstances this would reduce the 
electric power system's reliability. Apparently the main goal of 
the patrol was to get power to distribution panel RShchN No. 6 
so that the electric exhaust fan of the aft ring of the general 
ship ventilation system could be started. But there is no one to 
check this with, because the entire BCh-5 electrical engineering 
division perished. 
  The damage control party took no instruments with it as it 
set off to check the temperature of the fore bulkhead of 
compartment 6. 
  From the ship's log: 
  ``1457--Venting of compartment 4 with compartment 4's 
exhaust fan started. 
  1502--RDO No. 14 transmitted. 
  1512--Exhaust clack valves of compartment 4 closed. 
Venting of compartment 5 through hatch of compartments 3 and 4 
using exhaust fan of aft unit started.'' 
  The readiness of compartment 4 for venting was verified from 
1218 to 1233, but because of the absence of power to 
distribution panel RShchN No. 6, this venting was not started 
until something over 2 hours later. 
  RBZh-PL-82, Article 98: ``To maintain permissible 
concentrations of gases (toxic substances) in the atmosphere of 
compartments adjacent to distressed compartments, after the 
submarine rises to the surface these compartments must be vented 
into the atmosphere to the extent possible.'' 
  This possibility was not utilized for more than 2 hours. 
  From the ship's log: 
  ``1518--Transmitted to airplane: No water entering. 
Fire being put out by sealing off compartments. Air only in one 
VVD group.'' 
  The message received by the Northern Fleet's command post at 
1535 reads: ``Fire still burning in compartments 6, 7. Seaman 
Kulapin, Senior Seaman Bukhnikashvili died, need a tow. VVD 
remaining only in commander's group. Can no longer use the LOKh 
system. Monitoring pressure and temperature.'' 
  It is hard to say what there is more of in these 
messages--half- truths or deliberate disinformation. The 
submarine's leadership had no basis for asserting that the fire 
was still burning in the distressed compartments. Over 30 
percent of the ship's reserves of high-pressure air had been 
delivered into them. During the accident, gases flowed 
unhindered from the distressed compartments into compartments 5, 
3 and 2. How can there be any talk of putting out the fire by 
sealing off the compartments? The temperature of the bulkhead 
between compartments 5 and 6 was not measured. 
  High-pressure air did in fact remain only in one commander's 
tank group, but this happened over 3 hours previously, and since 
that time there was no air in the submarine's mains, and the 
air-foam fire extinguishing system was not working. By this time 
four persons had already died aboard the ship, but the death of 
only two was reported. The submarine needed a tow as of 1123, 
when according to the entry in the control log for the main 
propulsion unit the emergency safety rods and shim rods of the 
reactor were rested against their lower limit switches. The 
assertion of the submarine command that water was not entering 
the pressure hull was also groundless. At the moment the message 
was transmitted, the ship's situation was catastrophic, which is 
confirmed by the photographs taken from the airplane. Listing of 
the submarine had shifted to starboard. Trim rose to 1.5-2 
by the stern. It was time to shout ``Help, we're sinking!''. 
Processes that were not controlled and not thought out by the 
leadership were occurring aboard the submarine: surfacing with a 
list, growth of pressure in distressed compartments, dropping of 
this pressure, shifting of listing to the other side, increasing 
trim by the stern. How can there be any talk of monitoring 
pressure and temperature when even simple recording of the 
events was not provided for? On the whole these messages did not 
reflect the actual state of the distressed submarine, and 
disoriented the Northern Fleet's command post. 
  The government commission's working group felt that entry of 
water into the submarine's pressure hull began after 1400, and 
by 1500 the quantity of water that had entered compartment 7 was 
20 tonnes, which was reflected in the joint act of sections 4 
and 7 of this working group. 
<H5>  `` ``Explosions'' Observed!'' </H5>
  From the ship's log: 
  ``1521--Moved away from ``Ivolga''. RDO No. 14 
transmitted. Repeatedly. 
  1527--Transfer diving clothing to compartment 3. 
  1529--Compartment 6 bulkhead temperature over 100C. 
  1532--Definite acknowledgement of RDO No. 14 received. 
  1537--Communication session begins. 
  1538--Message received: A submarine is 100 km away, 
moving toward us at 14 knots. 
  1539--New personal RDO transmitted to us. Kadantsev, 
Yudin connected up to IP-6, left for compartment 5 to measure CO 
in 5.'' 
  The bulkhead temperature data were entered into the ship's 
log on the basis of the results of Yudin's and Ispenkov's 
patrol, which ended 40 minutes earlier. The temperature was once 
again estimated, without using thermometers. 
  A Soviet submarine was traveling toward the accident 
location. It was not moving fast. This is apparently the result 
of the ``Komsomolets'' leadership misinforming the Northern 
Fleet command. 
  After the message was received from the submarine at 1535, 
the commander of the Northern Fleet gave orders to prepare freon 
in canisters and 10 sets of air-dropped rescue containers 
(KAS-150) to be delivered to the accident location by an Il-38 
airplane. The absence of complete information on exchanges 
between the distressed submarine and the Northern Fleet's 
command post makes it impossible to determine what the grounds 
were for dispatching the KAS-150 (did the ``Komsomolets'' ask 
for them, or was this the initiative of the command post?). It 
is unclear how the freon canisters were to be transferred from 
the airplane to the submarine. 
  There are no special rescue detachments in the navy that 
could have been delivered to the accident region by air, and 
which could have dropped down together with rescue equipment to 
provide assistance to the crew. Had such detachments existed, 
their help would have been invaluable in this case. 
  From the ship's log: 
  ``1557--Kadantsev, Yudin returned from 5. Compartment 6 
bulkhead temperature 115C. CO measured--7 
mg/m[.sup]3[/].'' 
  Warrant Officer V. S. Kadantsev (interrogation tape 
recording): ``We got a 100-degree alcohol thermometer from the 
gyro-compass room. I went alone. The 3d division commander 
remained behind at the aft bulkhead of compartment 4. I inserted 
the thermometer into the cable lead-in from the direction of 
compartment 5, and the temperature climbed instantaneously to 
over 100C (somewhere around 115C). I came out and 
reported.'' 
  The RBZh-PL-82 requires that the temperature of a distressed 
compartment's bulkheads be checked; however, there are no 
recommendations as to how this is to be done. The standard 
submarine supply table lacks special instruments with which to 
check bulkhead temperature. 
  Despite the fact that the gas composition in compartment 5 
was practically normal as a result of venting and reduction of 
the amount of entering gas, the personnel never did return from 
either compartment 4 or compartment 5. It was clear that 
submarine damage control efforts were gradually shutting down. 
Subsequently only damage control division commander Captain 3d 
Rank Yudin and mechanics' crew chief Warrant Officer Kadantsev 
continued this struggle. The rest of the crewmembers (with the 
exception of compartment 1, the watchstander at the diesel 
generator and the signalmen) were in the conning tower 
superstructure or were providing ``overall leadership.'' 
  From the ship's log: 
  1612--``Kadantsev, Yudin connected up to IP-6. Went to 
compartment 5 to measure temperature of aft bulkhead of 
compartment 5. 
  1624--Yudin, Kadantsev returned. Temperature of aft 
bulkhead of compartment 5 111C. Shocks reminiscent of 
explosions in vicinity of compartments 6 and 7 observed. 
Believed to be regenerating cartridges.[.sup]44[/] Ten cans 
in compartment 6, 11 cans in 7. 
  1625--In 1, hydrogen--1 percent, oxygen--23.5 percent, 
personnel feeling satisfactory.'' 
  Warrant Officer V. S. Kadantsev (interrogation tape 
recording): Five minutes later the BCh-5 commander sent us back 
there again to shut the bulkhead clack valve (it was supposed 
that it was open, which is why the temperature was not falling 
and the fire continued to burn). When we looked, the clack valve 
was in its normal closed position, and the pressure equalizing 
valve was closed. We tried to open it--the temperature climbed 
instantaneously, you couldn't keep your hand on it, there was a 
whistling sound. We closed it. There was pressure in compartment 
6 after all. Not much, but it was there.'' 
  In the meantime outboard water was entering compartment 7 
with high intensity, compressing the air in the distressed 
compartments. This explains the continued presence of pressure 
in compartments 6 and 7. 
  Much was written in the press about ``explosions,'' after 
which the submarine quickly sank. They were written about not 
only by ``armchair'' captains of various ranks and other 
``specialists'' like them. People who knew what they were 
writing about also wrote. 
  Thus, Vice Admiral V. V. Zaytsev stated: ``Explosions were 
heard aboard the submarine in the aft compartments at 1624. The 
situation worsened dramatically at 1640. The submarine acquired 
a trim by the stern, which attested to entry of water into the 
pressure hull and a danger of flooding.''[.sup]45[/] A clear 
cause-and-effect relationship is drawn here between the 
``explosions'' on one hand and abrupt worsening of the situation 
and the submarine's demise on the other. 
  Captain 1st Rank B. G. Kolyada (interrogation tape 
recording): ``Explosions began at the stern, explosions that 
shook the submarine. It was decided that these were possibly the 
regenerating system exploding.'' Kolyada did of course make the 
qualification on the spot: ''No, I'm not suggesting that the 
hull was ruptured by the explosion. The submarine was jarred, 
but not strongly enough to rupture the pressure hull.'' 
  Nonetheless, these ``shocks reminiscent of explosions'' 
wound 
up in the ship's log, and were transmitted as ``explosions'' in 
a message to the Northern Fleet's command post. 
  Warrant Officer V. S. Kadantsev (interrogation tape 
recording): ``When we entered compartment 5, we heard two 
shocks-- ``babakh-babakh''--at the stern, before the enclosure 
of the turbo- circulating pumps (the officers heard more). We 
measured the gas composition in the compartment. This was an 
hour before the submarine sank. We had not heard shocks before 
this.'' 
  None of the other surviving crewmembers said anything about 
``shocks'' or about ``shocks reminiscent of explosions,'' or 
simply about ``explosions.'' 
  Captain Lieutenant S. A. Dvorov (interrogation tape 
recording): 
  Question: ``In what compartments are spent regenerating 
cartridges stored?'' 
  Answer: ``We did not use them, because they were in 
reserve. I didn't hear any explosions.'' 
  Apparently only Yudin and Kadantsev heard these shocks while 
they were in compartment 5. It may be understood from Warrant 
Officer Kadantsev's statement that they heard them while 
measuring the gas composition of air in compartment 5--that is, 
in the period from 1539 to 1557. The entry was made in the 
ship's log at 1624. 
  Thus there is also doubt regarding the time when these 
shocks 
were heard. And more likely the ``explosions'' that were 
``heard'' by Captain 1st Rank Kolyada in the conning tower 
superstructure and by Vice Admiral Zaytsev in Moscow have no 
relationship to actual events aboard the distressed submarine. 
  Nonetheless, Captain 1st Rank Kolyada is very reluctant to 
reject the desirable version of the sudden entry of water into 
the distressed compartments. Here is his reply to a question 
from the writer N. Cherkashin concerning ``what served as the 
cause of such a powerful and unexpected rush of water into the 
pressure hull'': ``First, the metal of the hull may have cracked 
due to the enormous temperature differential: It was thousands 
of degrees inside, and plus three outside.... Second, at high 
temperatures and high pressure, titanium can burn. The hull may 
have burned through at the border between compartments. Several 
other probable causes could be named.''[.sup]46[/] The writer 
and the captain 1st rank firmly decided that ``such a powerful 
and unexpected rush of water'' did occur, and that all that 
remained to do was to find a plausible story. But such a story 
does not exist, and any such story would not fit in with the 
chronology and with the actual circumstances of the accident. 
  Several words should be said about the jarring of the 
submarine observed during the time of the accident. 
  Captain Lieutenant A. G. Verezgov (interrogation tape 
recording): ``And now, the hull shuddered violently, 
periodically seven or eight times. In all probability VVD was 
flowing somewhere, because a wave couldn't do that.... The 
episodes of shaking were long-lasting. Each about 30-40 seconds. 
They began 30 minutes after surfacing, and they went on 
throughout the entire time the submarine was on the 
surface.'' 
  It is obvious from this statement that the submarine's 
shaking had nothing in common with ``explosions,'' and it was 
associated with entry of air into the distressed compartments 
from the high- pressure air system, blowing and flooding of main 
ballast tanks, escape of gases from the distressed compartments 
and entry of water into the pressure hull. 
<H5>  ``Prepare for Evacuation!'' </H5>
  What was the crew's assessment of the status of the 
distressed submarine at 1624, when information concerning 
``explosions'' was entered into the ship's log? Let's see what 
Captain 1st Rank Kolyada, the principal author of the open 
letter carried by the journal MORSKOY SBORNIK (No. 2, 1990), has 
to say. ``Yes, we were all truly certain until the last minutes 
that we would be able to save the submarine. Maximum possible 
sealing off of compartments 6 and 7, delivery of fire 
extinguisher into these compartments, and the decreasing 
temperature in the fore bulkhead of compartment 6 raised the 
hope that the fire would go out. The submarine's trim did not 
change until 1620, and there were no signs of water entering the 
pressure hull.'' 
  Such was the captain 1st rank's description of the last 
minutes of the tragedy in the open letter. But what was he 
reporting about these same minutes to the command post of the 
Northern Fleet? The report was received from the submarine at 
1635: ``The fire is intensifying. The temperature of the aft 
bulkhead of compartment 5 grew in 15 minutes from 70 to 
110C. Explosions could be heard from the regenerating 
system in compartments 6 and 7. The personnel need to be 
evacuated.'' 
  It would not be worth commenting on the above passage from 
the open letter--its falsehood is obvious. Let's look at the 
message. 
  Clear disinformation can be discerned in this message. There 
was no 15 minutes, and there was no intensification of the fire. 
The data (115C at 1557, and 111C at 1624) tell the 
opposite-- there was no fire, and the pressure hull was cooling 
down. But because of the large mass of metal, it was proceeding 
slowly. The``explosions'' fit in quite well with the message. It 
was apparently due to them that the personnel had to be 
evacuated. And although nothing is said about water entering the 
pressure hull, it is supposed that this was the case. Just 6 
minutes later, at 1641, a new message was received: ``The lines 
of defense are at the aft bulkhead of compartment 5. List 6 
to starboard, trim 3 meters (that corresponds to 1.5) by 
the stern due to entry of water into the pressure hull. 
Personnel ready for evacuation.'' 
  The ``explosions'' occurred, and ``such a powerful and 
unexpected rush of water into the pressure hull'' came about. 
There is also more than enough disinformation in this message. 
Lines of defense had not been organized at the aft bulkhead of 
compartment 5. The personnel were not ready for evacuation. The 
command to prepare for evacuation had not yet been given. The 
trim indicated in the message was different from the actual 
figure. 
  As was noted above, sections 4 and 7 of the government 
commission's working group established from an analysis of 
photographs taken from the airplane that trim gradually 
increased, and that by 1630 it was 2.5-3 by the stern. The 
buoyancy reserve was lost gradually as well, due to filling of 
the ballast tanks and entry of water into the pressure hull. The 
loss of buoyancy reserve within the time indicated above was 
estimated by the working group at 760 tons; in this case the 
quantity of water that entered the pressure hull was estimated 
at 120 tons. 
  The members of the government commission's working group 
representing industry feel that given a 760 ton loss of total 
buoyancy reserve, as much as over 200 tons of water had entered 
into the pressure hull by this time. The loss of buoyancy 
reserve and the decrease in longitudinal stability of the 
submarine may have been determined by measuring its draft, and 
with a few simple computations. But this was not done. 
  In sending the message cited here, as early as before 1635 
the submarine leadership already believed that the ship was 
destined to sink. And even in these last minutes of the tragedy, 
the leadership of the ``Komsomolets'' lacked the courage to 
communicate the whole truth to the Northern Fleet's command post. 
  However, naval deputy commander-in-chief Vice Admiral V. V. 
Zaytsev disagrees with this conclusion. He stated the following 
opinion for the journal MORSKOY SBORNIK (No. 6, 1989): 
``Confident reports prior to 1635 indicate that ship damage 
control efforts were proceeding according to plan, that the 
situation aboard the submarine was being monitored, and that 
entry of water into the pressure hull was not noted.'' The 
conclusion--the most important thing is that these were 
``confident reports.'' 
  After such statements by the vice admiral you can't help 
becoming confused, and you don't know whom to believe: Vice 
Admiral V. V. Zaytsev as the naval deputy commander-in-chief, or 
Vice Admiral V. V. Zaytsev as the chairman of section 4 of the 
government commission's working group, who signed the joint act 
of sections 4 and 7. 
  How do we explain such an abrupt change in the nature of 
messages from the distressed submarine? There can only be one 
explanation. 
  After returning from compartment 5 (at 1624), Warrant 
Officer 
Kadantsev was ordered to blow the starboard main ballast tanks 
No. 5 and 7. 
  Warrant Officer V. S. Kadantsev (explanatory report): 
``On orders from the BCh-5 commander I shut the onboard valve of 
the starboard TsGB No. 7, and blew the starboard TsGB No. 7 and 
the starboard main ballast tank No. 5. Listing corrected to 
zero. The damage control division engineer reported that trim 
was growing, and that it was already 4 by the stern.'' 
  When interrogated by the government commission, Warrant 
Officer Kadantsev clarified that he blew the main ballast tanks 
with air remaining in high-pressure air bottles in cofferdam No. 
3. 
  There are no entries in the ship's log regarding the blowing 
of the indicated tanks. Lieutenant Zaytsev also makes reference 
to the blowing of the starboard main ballast tank No. 7. There 
is no basis for disbelieving Warrant Officer Kadantsev and 
Lieutenant Zaytsev. 
  To equalize trim, it would have been sufficient to blow one 
main ballast tank. However, they decided blow two tanks. How 
suitable was this decision, and how did it affect the stability 
and unsinkability of the submarine? Main ballast tanks No. 5 and 
7 are situated forward of the submarine's center of gravity. 
When they are blown, in addition to an increase in buoyancy 
reserve the submarine's trim by the stern increases. 
  The next mistake is obvious. The attitude of the submarine 
worsened, and remaining high-pressure air was expended 
purposelessly, even though it could have been used with great 
benefit to blow main ballast tank No. 10 through the air line 
servicing the outboard devices. 
  When two main ballast tanks on one side were blown 
simultaneously, the submarine was shaken severely, and it tilted 
abruptly toward the stern. The tail plane disappeared beneath 
the water. This abrupt change in the submarine's attitude was 
the cause of change in the nature of accident reports. 
  At 1630 the magnitude of longitudinal stability reached such 
low values that rapid growth of trim and the tragic outcome of 
the events may have been also seen by the ``unaided eye'' of a 
nonspecialist, and the submarine's possible sinking raised 
alarm, without a single ray of hope. This is confirmed by 
photographs taken from the airplane and by crew testimony. 
  Lieutenant A. V. Zaytsev (interrogation tape recording): 
  Question: ``How do you correlate growth of trim with 
time?'' 
  Answer: ``1 by the stern at approximately 1300, 
and 3 until 1600. At around 1700 trim was 6.2.... Trim 
began rising abruptly from 1630 to 1700.'' 
  Senior Lieutenant of Medical Service L. A. Zayats 
(explanatory report): ``Somewhere around 1630-1340 I went up out 
of the submarine for the last time. The trim by the stern was 
already sizable, and it continued to grow quickly.'' 
  Captain 1st Rank B. G. Kolyada (interrogation tape 
recording): ``Trim began to grow after 1600, with the rate of 
increase of the trim being high.'' 
  It would be pertinent to recall here the previously cited 
assertion by Captain 1st Rank Kolyada that the submarine's trim 
did not change before 1620. 
  From the ship's log: 
  ``1640--List 6 to starboard, trim 1.5 by the 
stern.'' 
  The trim value written in the ship's log does not correspond 
to the actual value, which is confirmed by the testimony cited 
above and by an analysis of photographs taken from the airplane 
at this time. The list data raise doubts as well. 
  Messages received from the submarine at 1635 and 1641 were 
like a bolt out of the blue to the naval command. The commander 
of the Northern Fleet transmitted the following order through 
the fleet aviation command post: ``Prepare rescue chamber,'' and 
he asked the tender ``Aleksey Khlobystov'': ``Report the 
situation in compartment 5, was the reactor shut down, were gas 
generators used, is the main bilge pump being used to drain the 
distressed compartments, report pressure in the distressed 
compartments, be ready to evacuate personnel.'' It is clear from 
this request that for practical purposes the Northern Fleet's 
command post had extremely scanty information about the accident 
and the fight against it. And a cheerful report was received in 
response to this query (1650): ``Situation in compartment 5 
normal, gas generators were not used, damage control efforts 
continuing.'' What would you expect the Northern Fleet commander 
to think upon receiving such a confident report which, Vice 
Admiral V. V. Zaytsev feels, ``indicates that ship damage 
control efforts were proceeding according to plan, that the 
situation aboard the submarine was being monitored etc.'' 
  And at the same time: 
  From the ship's log: 
  1642--``Prepare for evacuation. Surrender secret 
literature to executives. Prepare secret literature for 
evacuation.'' 
  Think about this phrase. It doesn't say evacuate casualties 
or patients to approaching vessels. It says evacuate the entire 
submarine crew. Thus when it sent the message that the Northern 
Fleet's command post received at 1635, the submarine's 
leadership already believed that the ship was doomed. At 1642 an 
order was given to prepare the crew for evacuation from the 
doomed ship. 
  The evacuation order was given, but nothing was said about 
where to evacuate to. It is one thing to evacuate to approaching 
vessels, and another thing into the waters of the Norwegian Sea. 
So where did they intend to evacuate the submariners? From the 
interrogation tape recordings: 
  Lieutenant A. L. Stepanov: ``After this I went below to 
prepare the secret literature for evacuation, because the 
commander said that ships would be approaching now, and only a 
mooring party would remain aboard the submarine.'' 
  Warrant Officer V. V. Gerashchenko: ``I thought that a 
vessel had approached and that we were being taken off. I asked: 
``But who is going to stay here?'' BCh-1 commander: ``Don't 
worry, someone will stay.... Let's go topside quickly. We'll 
sort it out there''. '' 
  How were the submarine personnel prepared for evacuation. 
And 
where did the ``father-commanders'' intend to evacuate them to? 
  Captain 1st Rank B. G. Kolyada: ``And finally, the most 
important thing: We went topside not to jump into the water. 
There was one goal--to get some fresh air and meet the tender, 
which was approaching.''[.sup]47[/] 
  Now there's that famous fleet hospitality for you! Over an 
hour would pass before the tender would arrive, and they're 
already going topside to meet it! And not a word about 
evacuation. Such was the explanation given by the captain 1st 
rank to the wide masses of laborers to his egress topside from 
the submarine. But here is the way things really happened: 
  Captain 1st Rank B. G. Kolyada (report to the Northern 
Fleet commander): ``An Il-38 airplane arrived in the area at 
1445, it reported that three surface ships would reach us by 
1800.... We realized from the dynamics of increasing list to 
starboard and trim by the stern that the submarine would not be 
able to remain afloat until 1800, and so the personnel were 
given the command to ``go topside'' at 1650.'' 
  Thus the crew of the submarine was preparing for evacuation 
to approaching vessels, although its leadership already knew at 
this time that they would have to evacuate into the water, into 
the Norwegian Sea. This was the first reason why the personnel 
wound up without rescue equipment. 
  How much time did the crew need to prepare for evacuation, 
to 
don thermal underwear and survival suits, or to grab life 
jackets and safety vests? 
  Warrant Officer Yu. N. Anisimov: ``All of the diving 
gear was ready in our compartment. Had we been given the command 
to put it on, we would have been able to dress each other in 5 
minutes.''[.sup]48[/] 
  At the same time the Northern Fleet's command post 
transmitted the following command to the ``Komsomolets'' by way 
of the tender ``Aleksey Khlobystov'': ``Use the commander's VVD 
group to blow the aft group of ballast tanks. Report change in 
list and trim.'' 
  Use of the high-pressure air reserve in the commander's tank 
group for damage control would have radically altered the 
situation aboard the submarine even in the last stage of the 
accident. Given all of the conditions, this would have kept the 
submarine afloat until the arrival of the tender ``Aleksey 
Khlobystov''. 
  However, the personnel could not use this reserve of 
high-pressure air because it did not know how to do this. Nor 
did a diagram of the high-pressure air system, which was used in 
an attempt to sort things out, provide any help. The absence of 
the RBITS had its effect. 
  ``We went through the entire combat training course, we 
prepared for several years for our independent ``great'' cruise, 
we studied at the training center, we worked out the course 
problems with grades of good and excellent, and we finished our 
combat exercises. The training went on in full correspondence 
with the guidelines. And naturally we worked on damage control 
problems,'' said Captain 1st Rank Kolyada in a letter published 
in the journal MORSKOY SBORNIK (No. 2, 1990). 
  And so, a command to prepare for evacuation was given at 
1642. Why were the personnel unable to make adequate 
preparations for this? 
  ``None of us expected such a huge inrush of water into the 
aft compartments, when the ship's fate was decided in a matter 
of minutes. This was clearly not enough time to go below into 
the compartments and bring up over 50 sets of individual 
equipment''-- such was the explanation of this given by Captain 
1st Rank Kolyada in the newspaper IZVESTIYA (15 January 1990), 
and there isn't a single word of truth in this explanation. 
  Rather than quickly preparing rescue equipment, the 
personnel 
were occupied in the hasty evacuation of secret documents. There 
was enough time to go below and gather together the secret 
documents. These bits of paper turned out to be more precious to 
the submarine's leadership than the lives of the people. 
  Lieutenant A. L. Stepanov (explanatory report): 
``Everyone in the submarine was preparing for evacuation to a 
vessel. The submarine commander gave orders to prepare secret 
documents for evacuation. The BCh-1 commander and I began 
gathering documents. The trim began growing abruptly. The 
executive officer ordered us to take our vests and go topside. 
We continued to gather secret documents. Lieutenant Zaytsev ran 
up and said that the trim was 4- 5, and we had to go 
topside quickly. We left the secrets in the submarine and raced 
topside.'' 
  Interrogation tape recordings: 
  Captain Lieutenant S. A. Dvorov: ``A very great amount 
of time was lost evacuating secret documents.'' 
  Warrant Officer V. V. Gerashchenko: ``Everyone was 
running topside, and we got stuck with the box of secret 
documents. This created a small traffic jam.'' 
  Lieutenant A. V. Zaytsev: ``We exited mostly without 
vests, because there was no time, and it was dark.'' 
  Lieutenant Zaytsev's assertion that it was dark at this 
moment in the submarine is inconsistent with reality, and is not 
confirmed by a single participant of the tragedy. 
  Who can explain why boxes and bags of secret documents had 
to 
be gathered together and carried topside more than an hour 
before the expected arrival of vessels? If they were so 
concerned about preserving state secrecy, then: 
  Warrant Officer E. D. Kononov (explanatory report): 
``Carrying documents, I went topside, where I was washed 
overboard by a wave. I lost sight of the safe containing secret 
documents. One box containing documents was raised up to the 
tender. The second wasn't found.'' 
  Can any navy staffer guarantee that the contents of this 
box, 
as well as of the other boxes and bags, are lying at the bottom 
of the Norwegian Sea, and not being studied in other countries? 
  But high-placed representatives of the navy decided to 
forestall the ``probable adversary'' and publish most of the 
secret data on the submarine ``Komsomolets'' in the open press, 
and the initiative in this belongs to commander-in-chief Fleet 
Admiral V. N. Chernavin in the 13 May 1989 edition of the 
newspaper KRASNAYA ZVEZDA. 
  The WALL STREET JOURNAL cites the following statement by the 
U.S. Navy chief of intelligence, Rear Admiral Thomas Brooks: 
``Glasnost made it possible for us to obtain the kind of 
invaluable information...on the Soviet Union for the collection 
of which we would have had to spend millions of dollars and 
waste many long years (using traditional intelligence gathering 
methods).'' As an example he cited the accident aboard the 
submarine ``Komsomolets''. Permit me, Comrade 
Commander-in-Chief, to congratulate you and your closest 
assistants, and offer a high evaluation of your efforts in 
behalf of U.S. naval intelligence! 
  Thus the senseless, or more accurately criminal, order to 
evacuate secret documents was the second reason why the 
personnel were unable to prepare for evacuation. Just due to 
this, members of the ``Komsomolets'' crew failed to put on 
survival suits, and did not take their safety vests and life 
jackets. The submarine's leadership failed to give the order to 
prepare the LAS-5M rescue boat located in compartment 1, and it 
did not give the command in time to prepare rafts and the rescue 
chamber for separation from the submarine. The one thing that 
the leadership of the ``Komsomolets'' did manage to do was to 
report to the Northern Fleet's command post back at 1641 that 
the personnel were ready for evacuation. 
<H5>  The Rescue Rafts </H5>
  From the ship's log: 
  ``1645--Compartment 1 unsealed. Prepare battery tank 
for venting.'' 
  This was the last entry in the ship's log. 
  Warrant Officer V. S. Kadantsev (explanatory report): 
``The mechanic ordered me to close the bulkhead door between 
compartments 4 and 5, shut shut-off 1 of the aft block's exhaust 
ventilation system, and shut the bulkhead door between 
compartments 4 and 3. Before shutting the bulkheads between 
compartments 4 and 5 I walked back to the stern and checked the 
temperature of the compartment 6 bulkhead. It was exactly 
100C. I closed the bulkhead and started shutting shut-off 1 
of the exhaust ventilation system, but I could not shut it 
completely, because air began entering the ventilation 
shaft.'' 
  This is one more confirmation that there was no fire in the 
distressed compartments, and that the pressure hull was cooling 
down. 
  Fulfilling the incompetent order to close shut-off 1 of the 
exhaust ventilation system, Warrant Officer Kadantsev 
simultaneously opened the exhaust ventilation shaft flooding 
valve--that is, he unwittingly promoted faster flooding of the 
submarine. Another indication of the personnel's poor knowledge 
of the materiel. 
  The rescue vessels were still far away, while the cold 
waters 
of the Norwegian Sea were right there. Now came the time to put 
rescue equipment to use. We've already talked about the survival 
suits, the thermal underwear and the safety vests and life 
jackets. Because of the poor administrative skills of the 
submarine's leadership, most of the crew was without them. Nor 
was the LAS-5M boat deployed. 
  Immediately after the submarine surfaced, the personnel 
began 
preparing the PSN-20 rescue rafts for launching. This required 
from one (Lieutenant Stepanov) to two (Captain Lieutenant 
Paramonov) hours. The crew voiced complaints in this connection 
regarding the long time it took to prepare the rafts for use. It 
is hard to say how justified these complaints were. The 
``Komsomolets'' is the only submarine in the navy that carries 
rafts outside the pressure hull. It may be said without 
exaggeration that this location of the rafts saved the lives of 
most of the surviving crewmembers. And it is no accident that 
one of the measures for raising the survivability of submarines 
foresees studying the possibilities of locating rafts outside 
the pressure hull. As for the time it takes to prepare the rafts 
for use, the designer placed his priority (in the absence of any 
requirements and standards) on the reliability with which the 
raft containers were secured to the rescue chamber. 
  And so, the raft containers were prepared for launching. 
What 
has to be done to launch the rafts? In order for everyone to 
understand this, I should first say a few words about the 
structure of the raft launcher. The rafts of the submarine 
``Komsomolets'' were in hard containers, each with two 
rack-and-pinion releases. The upper release and lid were 
intended for extraction of the raft at a naval base for 
certification purposes, while the lower release is used to drop 
the raft on the water. When the lower rack-and- pinion is 
turned, the lower part of the hard container falls into the 
water together with the raft and sinks, while the raft remains 
on the water surface. The raft inflating system is activated by 
two tugs on a line. Thus 1 minute is enough to deploy rafts 
ready for launching. Instead of this, they began pulling the 
rafts out through the top, lowering them by hand to the deck of 
the superstructure, and activating the inflating system there. 
Considering the great weight of a raft (around 90 kilograms) and 
the position of the containers when they are moved out of their 
recesses, one can imagine how much effort it took for the people 
to launch a single raft. Not enough time was left to extract the 
second raft from its container. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-003LC-36A>           Location of Rescue Rafts and the Stages of Their Preparation for Use: </FIG>




   [Text] Why did this happen? Did Captain 1st Rank Vanin's 
crew know how to deploy the rafts? 
  Submarine Senior Watch Officer Captain Lieutenant A. G. 
Verezgov (interrogation tape recording): ``All I had were two 
log books for the rafts and some brief written instructions. But 
I never read about or saw how to use the rafts in the rescue 
chamber's recesses. Twice I inspected the rafts on the rescue 
station, removing the upper lid and pulling the rafts out from 
the top by hand.'' 
  But it would be wrong to assert on the basis of this 
statement by Captain Lieutenant Verezgov that no one in the crew 
knew how to deploy the rafts. Who was the first to begin pulling 
the rafts out from the top, thus guiding the actions of the 
personnel in the wrong direction? 
  Warrant Officer S. R. Grigoryan (explanatory report): 
``There were already many people topside.... Captain 1st Rank 
Kolyada tried to pull out the rescue raft, but he wasn't strong 
enough. I helped him extract the raft. Then I began pulling out 
the second raft.'' 
  Warrant Officer V. V. Gerashchenko (interrogation tape 
recording): ``We pulled out the raft on the left, and tried to 
open it up. Political affairs chief Burkulakov and Warrant 
Officer Grigoryan were standing on the right side. They were 
trying to pull the second raft out. I started helping them drag 
it up. The joke was on us. There's supposed to be a pedal there. 
You press it, and the raft falls down and opens up. But here we 
were dragging it up.'' 
  So there you have it. The technical ignorance of the 
``father- commanders'' aggravated the tragedy. Much time has 
passed since the accident, but Captain 1st Rank Kolyada still 
believes that the rafts had to be pulled out through the top. 
``Using the rafts was the only correct decision in that 
situation. But the design of the rafts turned out to be so 
imperfect that it was extremely difficult to extract them from 
the sealed containers, and beyond that, they were very easily 
upset by a wave,'' he said in the newspaper IZVESTIYA (15 
January 1990). The tragedy had not taught the captain 1st rank 
anything. 
  How did events develop subsequently? Let's look at the 
explanatory reports: 
  Warrant Officer V. V. Gerashchenko: ``People on the 
port side of the upper deck were trying to deploy the raft, but 
they were washed over the starboard side by a wave. It was 
impossible to pull the raft on the right side out of its 
container, and the water level rose over my legs, I swam over to 
the raft, on which people were already gathering.'' 
  Warrant Officer S. R. Grigoryan: ``I couldn't pull the 
second raft out by myself; I called out to Captain Lieutenant A. 
G. Verezgov, and he began helping me. Suddenly I found myself 
pulling on the raft alone--Verezgov, it turns out, jumped 
overboard. I looked at the bow of the ship, it was up rather 
high, but people and hats were already floating near the ship. I 
never did realize that the submarine was sinking, and so I 
continued pulling at the raft. Suddenly the water went over my 
head as the submarine rose to vertical and the impact of the 
water. (Sic.--D.R.). Even so, I was able to extract the raft, 
but I let go of it as it pulled me down.'' 
  As the submarine sank further, the positive buoyancy of the 
raft caused the line by which it was secured to the railing on 
the conning tower superstructure to break, and it rose to the 
surface. 
  What assessment did the crewmembers give to the raft? 
  Captain Lieutenant S. A. Dvorov (interrogation tape 
recording): ``The rafts are good-for-nothing, and their design 
is a disgrace. If we had other rafts, we could have saved some 
people....'' 
  Question: ``Did you practice launching the rafts in 
your daily life over the last 5 years?'' 
  Answer: ``Never in our lives. In the navy we spent our 
time scribbling on paper, rather than practicing damage control. 
Never in all of my career of 12 years had anyone ever deployed 
the life rafts. We never practiced egress through the torpedo 
tubes either. We studied this at the training station, but it 
wasn't hands-on. We don't know how to open up the aircraft 
rafts. I never saw the aircraft rafts.'' 
  Such is the assessment, which is very full of emotion and 
very lacking in practical knowledge. But this didn't keep 
Captain Lieutenant Dvorov from subsequently continuing his 
bemoaning of the rescue equipment and talking about the crew's 
high combat proficiency. ``Armchair-seamen'' journalists began a 
campaign bemoaning and deriding Russian equipment and seeking 
its mythical inadequacies on the basis of statements by such 
``experts'' in the press, but more about that later. For the 
moment, let's listen to a specialist. 
  Chief designer B. Z. Taubin:[.sup]49[/] ``Inflatable 
life rafts (PSN) are a group rescue resource used by navies of 
all the world. Owing to the speed of their automatic deployment, 
their invulnerability to blows against the side of a vessel, and 
other positive qualities, rafts are commonly considered to be 
the most effective modern rescue craft. In combination with 
competent use of rescue rafts and training of all seamen in 
their use, equipping vessels of the country's fishing fleet with 
them had completely excluded the loss of human lives in ship 
accidents and sinkings resulting from imperfections of rescue 
equipment.... In the accident aboard the submarine 
``Komsomolets'', rather than dropping the inflatable raft onto 
the water in its container, and then activating the gas 
inflating system by tugging the inflating line, the personnel, 
who were not trained in the rules of using such a raft, undid 
the lacing and extracted the raft from its container. This 
defeated the raft deployment design, and the raft filled with 
gas while upside down, which resulted in the deaths of many 
people. The lack of training of the crews of warships and naval 
auxiliary vessels practically cancels out the reliability of 
inflatable rafts and promises bitter consequences. Nor does the 
navy have stations at which inflatable rafts could undergo 
annual certification, which is contradictory to the technical 
conditions governing their use. For your information: There are 
around 50 such stations working in contact with the 
manufacturing plant within the Ministry of Fish Industry, the 
Ministry of Maritime Fleet and some other civilian departments 
of the country.'' 
  We should add to this that violation of the rules of using 
rafts caused the upper floats and awning supports to be 
underinflated, and this prevented the personnel from turning the 
raft over in the water, reduced its buoyancy, and sharply 
worsened the conditions of the people inside it. And the 
submariners paid for these mistakes with their lives. 
  It was precisely at this time that the last message was 
received from the submarine: ``Trim increasing abruptly. All 
personnel are topside.'' 
<H5>  The Rescue Chamber </H5>
  Much was written in the press about why submarine commander 
Captain 1st Rank Ye. A. Vanin went back down into the submarine. 
In the opinion of the authors of such articles, while topside 
the commander learned that there were still people down below, 
and this motivated him to go back inside the submarine. Much was 
said in this case about old naval traditions and about heroic 
deeds. It seems that all of these authors were paying a dubious 
service to the commander, at least because according to old 
naval tradition, before abandoning ship the commander must make 
sure that he is in fact the last to leave. But tradition does 
not foresee departure of the commander from a ship followed by 
his subsequent return. So why did the commander, who was 
topside, go back inside the submarine? 
  Let's back-track a little. At 1645 the Northern Fleet 
commander ordered the commander of the ``Komsomolets'' to 
prepare the rescue chamber (VSK) for separation from the 
submarine. 
  Warrant Officer S. R. Grigoryan (explanatory report): 
``...after which I began pulling out the second raft. At this 
time the commander gave orders to prepare the VSK for release, 
and crawled into the VSK.'' 
  Apparently the submarine commander went topside in order to 
estimate the situation and to give the order to prepare the 
rescue chamber for separation from the ship, because at this 
time all the personnel were topside. This can be the only 
explanation why Captain 3d Rank V. A. Yudin, Warrant Officer A. 
V. Krasnobayev and Warrant Officer S. I. Chernikov were in the 
chamber in addition to the commander and Warrant Officer 
Slyusarenko. 
  Warrant Officer V. F. Slyusarenko (interrogation tape 
recording): ``I took the secret file the BCh-1 commander gave 
me, and went over to the security officers, to whom I turned 
over the file, because the evacuation was starting. There was no 
one in the gyro-compass room, so I grabbed two vests (I couldn't 
find any more) and ran to the exit. I could see the commander 
standing with one leg on the ladder beneath the hatch. He asked 
me: ``Are you the last?'' I replied: 'Yes,' because I hadn't 
seen anyone else. It was then that Yudin shouted from above that 
Captain 3d Rank Ispenkov was still back there--he was attending 
to the diesel generator, having replaced Seaman Filippov when 
the latter became too weak. I ran back for Ispenkov, and at that 
moment the submarine tilted severely to the stern. I went down 
the ladder and shouted to Ispenkov, who dropped everything and 
ran topside. He was wearing ear muffs. At he was climbing up he 
shouted that water was entering compartment 3. A jet of water 
was beating against the right side from the back of compartment 
2.'' 
  It follows from Warrant Officer Slyusarenko's statement that 
Captain 3d Rank Ispenkov had not been informed of the 
evacuation. It was asserted later on in the press[.sup]50[/] 
that Ispenkov ``probably didn't hear the often-repeated command 
to evacuate.'' Even the novice submariner knows that next to a 
working diesel generator the human voice cannot be heard beyond 
just 1 or 2 meters away, and no voice commands can reach the 
action station beside the diesel generator. Captain 3d Rank 
Ispenkov should have been informed of the evacuation by a 
special messenger, but this was not done. 
  In addition Slyusarenko's statement confirms that the 
lighting was functioning in the submarine's compartments until 
the very last moment, and Lieutenant Zaytsev's assertion of the 
reverse is inconsistent with reality. 
  How suitable was the order to prepare the rescue chamber for 
separation from the ship? Under certain conditions the chamber 
could have become a very great aid in survival of people in the 
frigid waters of the Norwegian Sea. Meaning that the order was 
suitable. Unfortunately it was given too late. But even so, all 
was not yet lost. 
  Much has been written about the rescue chamber. Most 
authors, 
who won't make the effort to even try to understand what this 
thing is, condemn the rescue chamber, calling it the ``chamber 
of death.''[.sup]51[/] The impression is created that even 
special articles devoted to rescue chambers are written by 
dilettantes.[.sup]52[/] Something needs to be said about the 
rescue chamber in this connection. 
  As is the case aboard other submarines, the rescue chamber 
of 
the ``Komsomolets'' is intended for the rescue of the entire 
crew when the submarine is on the bottom. It should be stated 
that the question of the possibility of detaching the surface 
chamber from the submarine when the latter collapses at depth 
(known as damage control problem No 4) was examined in the 
planning process, but work on this variant produced a negative 
result. 
  The rescue chamber is secured at its coaming by a 
rack-and-pinion release to the coaming of the submarine, such 
that a waterproof space (the fore chamber) is created between it 
and the ship's hull. Detaching the rescue chamber after its 
occupation by the crew requires: closing and locking the lower 
conning tower hatch and the lower hatch of the rescue chamber; 
setting the catch manually; turning the rack-and-pinion ring 
pneumatically or by hand; filling the fore chamber with water 
and equalizing its pressure with the outside water pressure; 
when necessary, feeding air to the pneumatic pusher for initial 
separation of the rescue chamber from the submarine. 
  That's all that needs to be said about the rescue chamber. 
  The submarine ``Komsomolets'' began sinking with a trim of 
around 80 by the stern. 
  Warrant Officer A. M. Kopeyka (interrogation tape 
recording): ``The mechanic shouted: ``Close the hatch--there are 
people in there!'' The submarine was already going down, but I 
managed to force the upper conning tower hatch down with my 
legs.'' 
  Warrant Officer V. F. Slyusarenko (explanatory report): 
``I ran to the exit, to the VSK, and started climbing up, but 
the water falling from above washed me away. I got rid of the 
life jackets and started climbing again, but the water swept me 
away again.'' 
  Warrant Officer V. S. Kadantsev (the newspaper 
PODVODNIK ZAPOLYARYA, 20 April 1989): ``They were in the VSK. 
Kopeyka used his leg--slam! And the catch on the hatch cover 
engaged. Had those who remained in the chamber battened it down, 
everything would have been all right.'' 
  And so, the upper hatch of the rescue chamber was held in 
place only by its catch. Water entered the chamber. Calculations 
show that the water that entered the chamber reduced its 
positive buoyancy to the minimum, equal to around 1-1.5 tonnes. 
  There is no need to discuss the difficulty with which 
Warrant 
Officer Slyusarenko managed to get inside the rescue chamber. It 
was not until the submarine's trim equalized that Captain 3d 
Rank Yudin and Warrant Officer Chernikov were able to drag 
Warrant Officer Slyusarenko into the chamber. A great deal of 
effort had to be expended to close and batten down its lower 
hatch. 
  Warrant Officer V. F. Slyusarenko (interrogation tape 
recording): ``I was pulled by my arms into the VSK on the 
commander's orders, and they began closing the hatch right away. 
Krasnobayev and I held onto the lower hatch of the VSK by a rope 
tied to the handle.... Then water started coming in from above, 
completely flooding the fore chamber--dirty liquid. (He is 
referring to the coaming of the lower hatch of the VSK, and not 
the fore chamber.--D.R.). The commander gave the order to batten 
down the hatch in the fore chamber. Using a monkey wrench, Yudin 
and Chernikov managed to close the hatch. Before the hatch was 
closed we heard noise recalling boiling water--obviously air was 
escaping from the sinking submarine.'' 
  As we can see from this, air entered the chamber from the 
submarine at the moment the lower hatch of the rescue chamber 
was being battened down, creating an elevated pressure within 
it. Unfortunately, no one who remained in the chamber attached 
the proper significance to this, because toxic gases entered the 
chamber together with the air. It is hard to estimate the depth 
at which the lower hatch of the rescue chamber was closed, and 
how high the pressure rose within it. We can assume that the 
depth was 300-400 meters, and the pressure was 1-2 
kg/cm[.sup]2[/]. 
  And what about the lower conning tower hatch, which should 
have been closed first? 
  Warrant Officer V. S. Kadantsev (interrogation tape 
recording): 
  Question: ``Had the fore chamber hatch been battened 
down? (The reference is to the lower conning tower 
hatch.--D.R.).'' 
  Answer: ``No. Because the ladder had to be dropped. 
There wasn't enough time.'' 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-003LC-40A>           Rescue Chamber: 1--catch setting mechanism; 2--manual rack-and-pinion turning mechanism; </FIG>




  [Text] But the ladder was not the only thing that prevented 
closure of the lower conning tower hatch. The air hose that had 
been installed for oxygen decompression treatment would also 
have been an obstacle to closing it. In addition the rescue 
chamber was ``tethered'' by this hose to the submarine's 
pressure hull. This meant that the rescue chamber could surface 
only after the submarine compartments were completely flooded 
and the pressure within it was equalized with outside pressure, 
on the condition that the chamber's buoyancy would be sufficient 
to break the air hose. But the men who remained in the chamber 
didn't think of this. 
  Warrant Officer V. F. Slyusarenko (explanatory report): 
``At this moment we heard a rapping from below. In all 
probability this was Ispenkov. The commander began shouting: 
``Come on, open the hatch, they might still be alive there!'' He 
obviously didn't know that Ispenkov was alone.'' 
  But it was already too late. Soon after, there were several 
shocks--the transverse bulkheads were obviously breaking. Then 
the noise stopped. 
  Warrant Officer Slyusarenko (interrogation tape 
recording): ``The commander said: ``Hurry and release the VSK.'' 
You could hear the bulkheads cracking. I asked: ``How deep is 
the sea?'' They told me: ``1500. Hurry, or we'll be crushed.'' 
The depth gauge read 400 meters, and the pointer was no longer 
moving--it had gone off the scale. Yudin started releasing the 
valves. One was used to flood the fore chamber, and the other 
was for emergency release of the VSK. Yudin opened the VSK 
release valve, but nothing happened. The commander said: 
``What's this, have you forgotten how to release the VSK? Come 
on, remember!'' Chernikov began reading the instructions on 
releasing the VSK. Following the instructions, Yudin began 
turning the VSK's rack-and-pinion. The three of us started 
turning the rack-and-pinion with a wrench, but we were 
unsuccessful. The commander said that if we reach bottom, the 
VSK would collapse, when suddenly there was a shock beneath us, 
like a bomb exploding, followed by intense vibration.'' 
  The sequence of the personnel's actions following separation 
of the rescue chamber from the submarine was presented somewhat 
differently in Warrant Officer Slyusarenko's explanatory report. 
In particular, it may be surmised from the report that first 
they tried to turn the rack-and-pinion by hand, using a wrench, 
and only after that did they try to do it by opening the valves. 
But that's not the point. We cannot be fully certain that the 
personnel had carried out all of the operation to separate the 
rescue chamber from the submarine correctly, even with the help 
of the posted instructions. This is despite the fact that the 
crew is supposed to know how to do this even in the absence of 
light. The ignorance of the personnel of the ``Komsomolets'' of 
the physical laws and principles of action of the rescue chamber 
releasing devices can be clearly discerned in this episode. With 
the lower conning tower hatch open, the crew could not have done 
anything to separate the rescue chamber from the submarine until 
pressure within the submarine equalized with the outside water 
pressure. 
  Nor was Captain 1st Rank Kolyada able to sort this out. With 
the aplomb of that ``scholar who lived next door'' in that 
Chekhov story, he discusses the ``reasons'' why they were unable 
to disconnect the rescue chamber in time, and he believes that 
it separated by chance.[.sup]53[/] 
  What actually happened? Apparently after the latch securing 
the rescue chamber was released, the pneumatic system was used 
to turn the rack-and-pinion to the position permitting 
separation of the chamber. An attempt to once again turn the 
rack-and-pinion manually with a wrench was unsuccessful under 
these conditions. Opening of the fore chamber flooding valve 
produced no results because the lower conning tower hatch was 
open, and outside pressure continued to press the rescue chamber 
against the coaming of the submarine's pressure hull with great 
force. 
  At what depth was the ship when that shock recalling an 
explosion occurred, and how many shocks of this kind were there? 
Captain 1st Rank Kolyada and warrant officers Slyusarenko, 
Kopeyka and Grigoryan heard one shock. Captain Lieutenant Orlov 
believes that there were two shocks. What could have caused the 
explosion-like shocks? 
  A review of video tapes and photographs of the submarine 
``Komsomolets'' lying on the bottom revealed damage to the upper 
cover of compartment 1's entry hatch (the lower cover of the 
entry hatch was opened by the personnel during evacuation). The 
nature of the damage and the positions of the damaged structures 
clearly indicate that this damage occurred after the submarine 
struck bottom. Of all the possible causes of damage to the upper 
cover of the entry hatch (explosion of ammunition, explosion of 
gases released from the storage battery or torpedoes, a shock 
wave caused by elastic deformations of the pressure hull as the 
submarine struck bottom, and hydraulic shock occurring with 
rupture of the pressure tanks), hydraulic shock is the most 
probable cause. When the submarine struck bottom, the pressure 
tanks in compartments 2 and 3 ruptured, producing a hydraulic 
shock. It damaged the upper cover of the entry hatch of 
compartment 1, and helped the rescue chamber to separate from 
the submarine. This shock, which recalled an explosion, should 
have sounded like a double shock, and it was detected by the 
people in the rescue chamber and aboard the life raft.

  [Text] This discussion of hydraulic shock is based on 
the practical experience of designing the submarine 
``Komsomolets''. In 1975, during strength trials on an 
experimental compartment of this submarine, the testing chamber 
was ruptured by a hydraulic shock. The conditions causing it 
were repeated in relation to many parameters during the 
submarine tragedy. 
  Warrant Officer V. F. Slyusarenko (explanatory report): 
``...but suddenly an explosion of terrible force occurred 
beneath us, and vibrations passed through the entire hull. I 
thought the VSK had been crushed, but no water came in. The 
commander asked: ``So tell me, has the VSK been released or 
not?'' Yudin said that we didn't know. Then someone shouted for 
everyone to connect up to their IDAs. Chernikov and I connected 
up, but Yudin and the others didn't. Yudin lost consciousness, 
he went into convulsions, and was snoring.... From the upper 
tier the commander began giving orders to connect Yudin up to an 
IDA, which Chernikov and I did with great difficulty, because 
the mask was tight, and it was very hard to put it on. After we 
connected Yudin up and placed him comfortably on a bench, he 
began taking infrequent but deep breaths; wondering how the 
commander was doing because I was no longer hearing any orders 
from him, I crawled up. The commander was sitting on a bench 
with his head lowered. He was snoring, and an IDA was lying near 
his legs. Krasnobayev was lying on his side, showing no signs of 
life. He never did manage to pull his IDA from its storage 
compartment.'' 
  The attempts by Slyusarenko and Chernikov to place the mask 
of the breathing apparatus over the submarine commander's head 
were unsuccessful. 
  This brings to mind the article in the newspaper KRASNAYA 
ZVEZDA (7 October 1989) in which Captain Lieutenant Verezgov 
discusses the political department chief, Captain 1st Rank T. A. 
Burkulakov: ``He was the one who came up with the contest for 
the best beard of the cruise.'' The degree to which this 
``contest'' is associated in this case with difficulties in 
donning IDA masks is unknown. In the ``good old days'' 
submariners were prohibited from growing beards on the basis of 
the need for using individual protective equipment. 
  In the words of Warrant Officer Slyusarenko, immediately 
after the ``explosion'' the air in the rescue chamber became 
filled with a dense mist, and it became much harder to hear. 
  The rest of the crew of the submarine ``Komsomolets'' was 
continuing its fight for its life during this time. 
  Warrant Officer A. M. Kopeyka (interrogation tape 
recording): ``People were floundering all around in the water, 
because they didn't know how to swim.... We were all without 
life jackets, no one had expected the submarine to disappear so 
quickly.'' 
  Captain 1st Rank B. G. Kolyada (report to the Northern 
Fleet commander): ``On finding themselves in the water, the 
personnel were forced to use just the one PSN-20 raft, the 
second had been swept about 100 meters away, and there was no 
swimming up to it.'' 
  And in the newspaper PODVODNIK ZAPOLYARYA (20 April 1989) 
the 
participants of the event shared their memories: 
  Captain Lieutenant V. A. Gregulev: ``And some didn't 
know how to swim. Seaman Mikhalev for example, a mechanic. A 
good seaman, conscientious. He went down so quietly, silently. 
Only because he didn't know how to swim.'' 
  Captain Lieutenant Yu. N. Paramonov: ``I was fully 
conscious the entire time, and I knew that it would be hard to 
make it on a single raft. But the second had drifted around 50 
meters away. I could see that this was a desperate situation, 
that we might all die, and so I decided to swim over to the 
second raft.'' 
  Unfortunately Captain Lieutenant Paramonov was unable to 
follow through with his intentions. 
  Warrant Officer V. V. Gerashchenko (interrogation tape 
recording): ``The raft was in the water. Waves broke over us 
head- high. Washing people off. Nothing could be done.'' 
  ``The rescued submariners said that fewer would have died, 
had the submariners had individual inflatable life rafts, like 
the kind naval pilots have. They would have been so useful to 
those jumping overboard into the frigid sea.''[.sup]54[/] 
  There was an LAS-5M aircraft emergency inflatable life raft 
of this kind, with a capacity of five men, in compartment 1. But 
the crew was so ``well'' trained that apparently it didn't even 
know of its existence. This life raft could have changed the 
situation in the most fundamental way: A possibility would have 
appeared for making use of the second PSN-20 raft and the rafts 
dropped from airplanes. And then all of the submariners could 
have accommodated themselves on the rafts, and even those who 
couldn't swim would have been saved. 
  Warrant Officer V. F. Slyusarenko (explanatory report): 
``Simultaneously with calling out to Chernikov for help I heard 
the noise of rushing water--this was the sound of the VSK rising 
to the surface, and the pointer of the depth gauge jerked and 
began dropping down abruptly from the 400 mark; the pointer on 
the pressure gauge also began crawling down. In 1-2 minutes the 
VSK surfaced. Chernikov had managed to come only half-way up. At 
this moment the pressure inside the VSK blew the catches on the 
upper hatch of the VSK, and Chernikov was ejected out like a 
cork. The force took me only half-way out, because I was a 
slight distance away from the hatch, beside the commander.... I 
saw Chernikov 20 meters away from the VSK, water rushed in 
through the open hatch from all directions, and in 5-7 seconds 
the VSK took on water and went down to the bottom like a rock. I 
stayed on the surface.'' 
  Given that the pressure in the rescue chamber was over 2 
kg/cm[.sup]2[/], the cover of the upper hatch may have been 
torn off from its catch, and the rush of air could have ejected 
Warrant Officer Chernikov out of the chamber. The possibility is 
not excluded that Chernikov himself released the catch on the 
hatch cover. Regardless of this, the carelessness of the 
submariners who remained in the rescue chamber (they hadn't 
battened down the chamber's upper hatch with its 
rack-and-pinion) resulted in its sinking and the demise of the 
people inside it. 
  The reactive force of the air jet forced the chamber below 
the surface, and ``swallowing'' water, it sank. Tentative 
calculations show that an initial chamber pressure of around 0.5 
kg/cm[.sup]2[/] would have been sufficient for this to occur. 
  How do we explain and tie together the ``explosion,'' the 
mist and the worsening of audibility coupled with the almost 
simultaneous loss of consciousness by three persons who had not 
put on the masks of their breathing apparatus? There are no 
sufficiently persuasive explanations for this. But all of this 
could be explained if we assume that the ``explosion'' and the 
vibration were separate in time from the rest of the events. 
Apparently right after the ``explosion'' the rescue chamber 
began surfacing, and as it approached the water surface the 
pressure inside the chamber unseated the upper cover of the 
chamber somewhat (this cover was held by a catch). The air in 
the chamber began bleeding overboard, and the pressure within it 
started falling swiftly. This caused the ears of the people to 
``plug up,'' and worsened their hearing. The drop in pressure 
caused cooling of the air remaining in the chamber, and when the 
``dew point'' was reached, a mist formed. Because the chamber 
was filled with air having a high concentration of carbon 
dioxide and carbon monoxide, and consequently a reduced oxygen 
concentration, the drop in pressure reduced the partial pressure 
of oxygen in it below permissible limits. As a result of this, 
three of the crewmembers who had not put on their IDA-59 
self-contained breathing apparatus lost consciousness due to 
oxygen starvation, and were poisoned by carbon dioxide and 
carbon monoxide. All of the subsequent actions by warrant 
officers Slyusarenko and Chernikov to put the IDA-59 masks over 
the faces of Yudin and submarine commander Vanin occurred while 
the rescue chamber was on the surface. It follows from this 
version that the cover of the upper hatch had not been torn from 
its catch by the inside pressure. Instead, it had been released 
from it by Warrant Officer Chernikov. 
  Looking at the video tapes and photographs taken from 
submersibles in summer 1989, one significant detail can be 
noted, one which would have been wrong to hide or discard as 
unimportant. On an image of the visible part of the 
rack-and-pinion ring securing the rescue chamber to the 
submarine hull, one section of this ring may be classified as a 
section with a broken tooth. In the meantime the neighboring 
teeth show no visible damage. The absence of imagery of the 
matching part of the release on the submarine's pressure hull 
does not permit any definite conclusion. This question could be 
clarified fully only by raising the rescue chamber or submarine. 
But it would be very important to clarify it. This would help 
reduce the following conflicting statements by the tragedy's 
participants to a common denominator. Interrogation tape 
recordings: 
  Warrant Officer V. F. Slyusarenko: ``We never were able 
to release the rack-and-pinion of the VSK. I feel that we were 
torn away from it, that we hadn't released it, because it was 
said that there was an additional fastening bolt.'' 
  Warrant Officer V. S. Kadantsev: 
  Question: ``What kept the rack-and-pinion of the VSK 
from turning? 
  Answer: ``A locking device. There was no additional 
bolt.'' 
  In August-September 1991 a deep-sea submersible inspected 
the 
matching part of the rack-and-pinion release on the submarine's 
pressure hull. All of the teeth on the rack-and-pinion ring on 
the ship's pressure hull are undamaged, which clearly indicates 
that the system for separating the rescue chamber had worked 
``by the book,'' and confirms the absence of any additional 
fastening bolt that supposedly hindered turning of the 
rack-and-pinion. 
  Concluding our discussion of the rescue chamber, we can say 
the following. It sank together with the commander of the 
submarine, Captain 1st Rank Ye. A. Vanin, Captain 3d Rank V. A. 
Yudin and Warrant Officer A. V. Krasnobayev, and it is now lying 
on the bottom of the Norwegian Sea with the upper hatch open, in 
ideal conditions for raising. The technical resources available 
to the navy can accomplish this raising in a short time without 
significant expense. But the commander-in-chief of the navy has 
nothing to say, his numerous admirals have nothing to say, and 
captains of all ranks have nothing to say. They have obviously 
exhausted the limit of their concern for the crew of the 
submarine ``Komsomolets'', such that there was not enough left 
for giving three submariners a decent human burial in the 
ground. It might be said that raising the rescue chamber from a 
depth of around 1,600 meters is a complex engineering problem, 
and failure would be possible. I agree. But he who does nothing, 
gets nothing. Yes, we might even fail, but we still need to make 
the attempt to raise the chamber. 
  Concluding my narration of the actions of the crew of the 
submarine ``Komsomolets'' during the accident, it would be wrong 
not to mention the heroic and self-sacrificing actions of 
certain members of the crew. And among them, Captain 3d Rank 
Anatoliy Matveyevich Ispenkov, who carried out his military duty 
to the end, should be named first. Nor can we forget Senior 
Seaman Nadari Otariyevich Bukhnikashvili and Warrant Officer 
Vladimir Vasilyevich Kolotilin, the first to meet the challenge 
of the situation, Captain 3d Rank Vyacheslav Aleksandrovich 
Yudin, who did much to save the crew, Captain 3d Rank Aleksandr 
Vasilyevich Volodin, Lieutenant Vadim Vladimirovich Zimin and 
Warrant Officer Gennadiy Vyacheslavovich Kovalev, who maintained 
communication until the last minutes of the tragedy, and Warrant 
Officer Yuriy Fedorovich Kapusta, who shared his rescue 
equipment with comrades. 
<H5>  The Results </H5>
  And so, we can make the following conclusions on the basis 
of 
the results of examining the circumstances of the accident: 
  1. Analysis of the crew's actions during the accident 
revealed its total inability to fight for the submarine's 
survival. Weak combat and occupational training of the crew led 
to the tragic outcome of the accident aboard the submarine 
``Komsomolets''. 
  2. Until the very last moment of the tragedy there was a 
possibility for radically changing the situation in the fight 
for the submarine's survival through active and competent 
actions, and in all cases, to keep it afloat until rescue 
vessels could arrive. The submarine sank with 25 percent of its 
reserve of high-pressure air unused, with the diesel generator 
operating, with an operating electric power system, with working 
damage control equipment, and with functioning electric 
lighting. The absence of the RBITS negatively affected both the 
crew's training in submarine damage control problems and its 
actions during the accident. 
  3. The delay of the submarine's attack center in 
transmitting 
the distress signal, the irresponsibility of the Northern 
Fleet's command post in organizing rescue operations, the lack 
of any leadership by the ship's command in evacuating the crew 
from the sinking submarine and the personnel's poor knowledge of 
the rules of using rescue equipment were the causes of the 
demise of the greater part of the crew. 
  4. There is no evidence that the submarine ``Komsomolets'' 
went to sea with a serviceable oxygen gas analyzer and with a 
serviceable television system. The faulty oxygen gas analyzer in 
compartment 7 and the grossest violations of the rules of 
operating the technical resources were the most probable causes 
of the fire in compartment 7. Absence of a technical crew aboard 
the submarine ``Komsomolets'' and, as a consequence of this, 
poor quality preparation of the ship for the cruise, were the 
preconditions for the accident. 
  5. No real or imaginary imperfections in equipment, systems 
and the submarine itself were the cause of the accident and the 
fire in compartment 7, or influenced the tragedy's outcome. 
  6. During the accident all equipment of the main propulsion 
unit operated trouble-free, blocking and safety systems foreseen 
by the design worked normally, ensuring timely deenergizing and 
accident-free inactivation of all equipment in distressed 
compartments. The reactor control system and emergency shielding 
reliably inactivated the reactor and cooled it down without 
mishap. 
  7. The conclusion reached by the government commission in 
the 
investigation of the circumstances and causes of the demise of 
the submarine ``Komsomolets'' is unobjective as regards 
establishing the probable cause of the accident, and as regards 
the evaluation given to the events that led to the accident's 
development and to its tragic outcome, and as a consequence of 
this, as regards the assessment of the fact itself of the 
accident and the causes bringing it about. 
  Looking at the accident of the submarine ``Komsomolets'' as 
an isolated case, and because the members of the commission 
belonged to the integral military-industrial complex, the 
government commission was incapable of objectively and 
faithfully revealing the real causes of the high accident rate 
in the navy, and of giving this the proper assessment. 
  Ending our analysis of the tragedy's development and of the 
actions of personnel of the submarine ``Komsomolets'', it should 
be said that the author does not claim to have the absolute 
truth in interpreting particular events and facts. He may err in 
some things, and he may understand other things the wrong way. 
But he is convinced of one thing: The tragedy of the submarine 
``Komsomolets'' was the result of its poor preparation for the 
cruise, and a consequence of the low combat and occupational 
training of the crew. 
  The responsibility for this must be borne by the navy's Main 
Directorate for Combat Training and the Main Directorate for 
Operation and Repair. 
  There still are numerous unanswered questions in the 
investigation of the circumstances of the accident of the 
submarine ``Komsomolets''. There wouldn't be any if the naval 
leadership hadn't done everything it could to hinder this 
investigation. 
<H5>  About ``Deficiencies'' and ``Technical Imperfections'' </H5>
  As the government commission's work proceeded, and as the 
causes of the accident and the real circumstances that led to 
the demise of the submarine ``Komsomolets'' became ever clearer, 
an extensive campaign to seek out all possible design 
deficiencies of the ship that had allegedly led to the tragedy 
was initiated in the press with the complicity of naval 
representatives. Let's examine the main ones. 
  1. In the 15 January 1990 edition of the newspaper IZVESTIYA 
and in the No. 2, 1990 edition of the journal MORSKOY SBORNIK, 
Captain 1st Rank Kolyada used the Soviet Military Encyclopedia 
in an attempt to persuade everyone that the submarine 
``Komsomolets'' was simply ``a vessel intended for 
experimentation, specially equipped and fitted out for various 
tests on new armament and hull structural units, and for 
experimental research on propulsion units, engines and other 
technical resources at sea.'' And that this submarine had 
supposedly been classified as ``nominally'' in the first 
line--that is, on the fighting team, with the ``grace'' of the 
navy. 
  The reader is supposed to make his own conclusion from 
this--that the demands put upon the submarine were too great, 
that there could be little talk of quality when what the 
designer created was not a submarine but something 
incomprehensible. No, this is not so. The ``Komsomolets'' was 
not ``a vessel intended for experimentation,'' but an 
experimental ship--that is, an experimental model of armament. 
And this, as they say in Odessa, is ``two large differences.'' 
The Soviet Military Encyclopedia states that experimental models 
of weapons (armament) are created ``for the purposes of testing 
new design (technological) ideas and solutions.'' 
  It was for these purposes that the submarine ``Komsomolets'' 
was created. But not only for them. This was a fighting 
submarine, and it was designed, built and transferred to the 
navy on the basis of standards and requirements imposed on a 
fighting submarine. High specifications and performance 
characteristics and the reliability of the technical resources, 
confirmed by experimental operation, made it possible for the 
first time in naval practice to adopt this submarine in 1988, to 
promote it up from the experimental category and award it the 
status of a fighting submarine. The government decree on 
adoption of the submarine ``Komsomolets'' by the navy was 
coordinated with many military leaders, including the naval 
commander-in-chief and the USSR minister of defense. In this 
respect, contrary to Captain 1st Rank Kolyada's opinion, the 
submarine ``Komsomolets'' did not require any additional 
certification. And the simple truth that submarines that are 
``nominally adopted into the first line'' do not go on patrol 
duty with a complete outfit of ammunition aboard, including 
nuclear devices, should have been explained to the captain 1st 
rank. All of these elementary truths should have been known to 
the deputy commander of the division to which the 
``Komsomolets'' belonged, and people should not have been misled 
with fables about ``a vessel intended for experimentation.'' 
  Unfortunately this has not ended the discussion of the 
experimental submarine. 
  2. The newspaper KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (15 March 1990) carried an 
article by Captain 1st Rank S. I. Bystrov citing the following 
pronouncement by naval commander-in-chief V. N. Chernavin in his 
interview with Academician A. P. Aleksandrov: ``Evidently, 
Anatoliy Petrovich, you've introduced this term, ``into 
experimental operation,'' with good advantage. Such transfer of 
ships is still going on. This is the way the worst ships get 
accepted. When builders begin to feel the pressure of a 
deadline, they all return to this term.'' I don't know if the 
naval commander-in-chief really made such a statement, but a lie 
remains a lie, no matter who speaks it. The complaint made by 
the naval commander-in-chief against those who transfer ``the 
worst ships'' sounds strange, particularly when he says nothing 
about those who accept these ``worst ships.'' But that's not the 
point. 
  From the very beginning, with assignment of the preliminary 
specifications in 1966, the submarine ``Komsomolets'' was 
designed as an experimental ship as regards problems associated 
with diving depth, and as a fighting ship in all other 
parameters. Its experimental operation was foreseen from the 
very beginning as well. Moreover, for what sort of other 
operation can an experimental submarine be transferred besides 
experimental? 
  I will dare to assert that all experimental models of 
equipment (including experimental submarines) are distinguished 
as a rule by high quality of manufacture, and the new 
technological concepts employed in these models are worked out 
meticulously in the testing process. And in order to be 
persuaded of this, it would be sufficient to compare 
experimental models of Russian articles at exhibitions with the 
series-manufactured models of these same articles sold in stores. 
  But this lie was not born in a vacuum. It has its own 
history, one which has no relationship to the submarine 
``Komsomolets''. 
  In 1980-1981, adoption of third-generation prototype 
submarines was threatened by failure. For various reasons these 
submarines had not undergone their basic trials. And then 
someone came up with the idea of transferring the prototype 
submarines into ``intensive operation,'' during which the trials 
could be completed. So appeared a new term in ship 
building--``intensive operation.'' This is when the ``conspiracy 
of the century'' occurred. But this was not a conspiracy between 
``wolves from industry'' and ``naive and liberal sheep'' from 
the navy. The conspiracy was ``between equals,'' because the 
navy was the main culprit. The torpedoes they had adopted 
couldn't be fired and the missiles wouldn't fly because of the 
absence of these submarines. The USSR Council of Ministers and 
the CPSU Central Committee also participated in this conspiracy. 
A political behind-the-scenes contribution was made as well: The 
great marshal of ``Malaya Zemlya'' had already announced to all 
the world the USSR's creation of the ``Tayfun'' strategic 
sea-based system to spite the ``infamous'' American ``Trident'' 
system. Something had to be done to save the day. The prototype 
submarines were transferred to ``intensive operation,'' and the 
participants of the deal were generously decorated with orders, 
medals and the titles of Lenin and State prize laureates. I 
don't know how things are going at the Mint, but the Committee 
on Lenin and State Prizes in Science and Engineering had 
exhausted its appropriations for several years into the future. 
  And so this unseemly history culminated with slander 
directed 
at the submarine ``Komsomolets''. 
  3. We need not dwell on the numerous publications referring 
to many unspecified mistakes or imperfections of various kinds, 
because they were written by people who did not have adequate 
information or who were far from knowledgeable about the essence 
of the issue. But there is one article that needs to be 
discussed. The newspaper NA STRAZHE ZAPOLYARYA (30 November 
1990) carried an article titled ``Assigning Responsibility for 
the Tragedy'' by Vice Admiral V. S. Kalashnikov, the Naval 
Academy's deputy chief for training and scientific work. It 
reads: ``The ``Komsomolets'' was a unique submarine, and its 
design deficiencies were also unique in their own way. 
Professionals know that their presence in a submarine directly 
influences its survivability.'' And that's all that the vice 
admiral, a professional, and the navy's highest specialist in 
``training and scientific work'' could say about 
``deficiencies.'' The vice admiral's logic is astounding: If it 
is a unique submarine, then it must have unique design 
deficiencies. The vice admiral is not troubled by the fact that 
his article does not cite any specific ``unique design 
deficiencies,'' or that it contains no analysis of their 
influence upon the accident's development. He fouled someone 
else's doorstep and now feels his work to be done. 
  On the other hand there is more than enough specific forgery 
and slander in this article. One can see right away that the 
author is in his element. To prove my point, let me cite a few 
examples. Vice Admiral Kalashnikov asserts: ``And the conclusion 
of the commission, which contained representatives of the navy, 
the designer and industry, is categorical: ``In the situation as 
it was, it was impossible to save the ship''.'' This assertion 
by the vice admiral is a forgery. The statement by the 
government commission, published in the press on 6 September 
1990,[.sup]55[/] reads: ``In the fight to save the submarine, 
the crew displayed self-sacrifice and courage, but in the 
situation as it was, the submarine could not be saved.'' This 
wording differs fundamentally from Vice Admiral Kalashnikov's 
assertions. 
  Nor are there any assertions in the commission's conclusions 
that in the fight for survival, ``the crew did even more than it 
could have in that situation.'' Kalashnikov lifted these 
``conclusions of the commission'' out of the conclusions of the 
navy's Main Directorate for Operation and Repair on the 
``Analysis'' made by Vice Admiral Ye. D. Chernov. Moreover the 
thoughts of the admirals in the ``Combat Training'' section of 
the government commission's working group concerning the high 
proficiency of Captain 1st Rank Vanin's crew are claimed to be 
the opinion of the government commission, which is also a 
forgery. Also clearly slanderous is vice admiral Kalashnikov's 
assertion that ``Vice Admiral Chernov is principally at fault 
for the poor training of Vanin's crew,'' that ``a tendency to 
keep the second crew off of the ship could be distinctly 
discerned in its training schedule during the time that the 
flotilla was under Comrade Chernov's command. It was not until 
after his departure in summer 1987 that the attitude toward this 
crew, its training and time at sea changed abruptly for the 
better.'' 
  Let's look at the facts. Vice Admiral Chernov commanded the 
submarine flotilla until June 1986, and not until summer 1987, 
as Kalashnikov asserts. For only 10 months of the 4 years' and 9 
months' existence of Captain 1st Rank Vanin's crew was it 
directly subordinated to Vice Admiral Chernov. Given these 
facts, only dishonorable people can discern any kind of trend, 
and accuse Vice Admiral Chernov of training this crew poorly. 
There were another 2 years and 8 months after Vice Admiral 
Chernov's departure from the flotilla for Captain 1st Rank 
Vanin's crew to prepare for its first independent cruise. This 
would have been fully enough time to form and train a new crew 
for any submarine. Many more examples of this sort could be 
presented, because Vice Admiral Kalashnikov's article is full of 
lies, beginning with the accusations against the commander of 
the first crew, Captain 1st Rank Yu. A. Zelenskiy, and ending 
with the dirty insinuations addressed toward Vice Admiral 
Chernov regarding a ``set of Japanese video recording 
equipment'' he supposedly received as a gift. Unfortunately, it 
is still very difficult in our country to prosecute slanderers, 
especially when they slander ``in the performance of official 
duty.'' 
  4. Considerable attention needs to be devoted to an article 
by Captain 1st Rank (Reserve) A. N. Gorbachev, a former 
submarine commander, printed in the newspaper KOMSOMOLSKAYA 
PRAVDA (29 April 1989), and to his interview with this paper on 
17 December 1989. In both publications Gorbachev blames the 
demise of the submariners and the submarine itself on the 
designer on the basis of rumors and talks with ``yardkeeper 
acquaintances'' of his. But it is not among designers, it is not 
in ship building industry, it is not in the military acceptance 
system and, finally, it is not in the navy's Main Directorate of 
Ship Building that we must seek those ``who sank this ship as 
well,'' as the captain 1st rank (reserve) does. 
  To put it briefly, the tragedy occurred due to a 
catastrophic 
gap between the level of the equipment installed in modern 
submarines and the level of occupational training of 
submariners, the quality of routine maintenance and repairs 
carried out during preparation of submarines for cruises. High 
personnel turnover brought about by the lack of social 
safeguards for submariners doesn't play the last role either. As 
for the culprits, they must be sought among those who permitted 
this inconsistency to develop. As for ``ensuring this 
nuclear-powered submarine against accidents,'' the high fire and 
explosion safety of the submarine ``Komsomolets'' was confirmed 
by an expert commission appointed by the navy after a hands-on 
inspection of its condition in the period from 11 to 20 October 
1983. 
  The fact that even after that deflagration occurred in 
compartment 5 a fire didn't start in it also attests to the fire 
safety of compartments of the submarine ``Komsomolets''. And it 
was not from a random electric spark or flash that the fire 
started in compartment 7, as Gorbachev asserts. The fire was 
predestined by the poor preparation of the ship for the cruise 
and the grossest violations of the rules of operating the 
submarine's equipment. 
  Nor was the compartment fully involved aboard the submarine 
in the initial period of the accident. It was not until 15-20 
minutes after the fire started as a result of the incompetent 
actions of the ship's command that the compartment became fully 
involved. 
  Praising or, on the other hand, cursing the LOKh fire 
extinguishing system using freon as the fire extinguisher 
wouldn't change anything. There are no alternatives today, and 
there will be none before 1995. And in the meantime the existing 
LOKh system is the most effective firefighting system. If the 
fire aboard the submarine ``Komsomolets'' had not been 
extinguished by means of this system, this system is not at 
fault: fire extinguisher was not delivered to the distressed 
compartment. 
  The rescue chamber was discussed earlier. There are full 
grounds for believing that the devices of the rescue chamber 
were designed ``by the book.'' The built-in electric lighting 
functioned in the chamber until the very last moment. 
Unfortunately the mistakes and vexing lapses of the personnel 
resulted in the fact that only one of five men survived. I am 
compelled to report, with Comrade Gorbachev in mind 
specifically, that the rescue chamber had been tested by the 
first crew of the ``Komsomolets'' during the period of 
experimental operation with the direct participation of 
representatives of the designer, the ship building plant and the 
navy's search and rescue service, and that the testing involved 
actual separation of the rescue chamber from the submarine and 
its surfacing. Thus the references by the captain 1st rank 
(reserve) to a ``chamber of death'' and his rhetoric--``who 
designed this chamber, and at what level of mind and 
heart?''--are groundless, and may be qualified as slander 
against the designer. I dare to assert that the chamber was 
designed by competent specialists at the highest ``level of mind 
and heart.'' 
  The former commander of the submarine asked some questions 
that sound very strange coming from him--``Who taught the 
submariners to use the life rafts and prepare them for use? And 
who taught the lads to find their individual protective 
equipment in total darkness and never lose contact with them?'' 
Is this really something that must be done by nannies from 
Moscow, or by governesses enlisted from abroad? Isn't this the 
responsibility of the command of the submarines and fleet 
formations? Or does the captain 1st rank (reserve) believe that 
this responsibility is confined only to telling a seaman who 
doesn't know how to swim: ``Jump, sonny, jump, my boy, swim out 
from the side: Our ship will soon go beneath the water''? 
  Concluding, let's consider Gorbachev's question ``...is he 
(Gorbachev--D.R.) capable of meanness?'' What other word can you 
use to describe the attempt to blame the designer for the 
submarine's demise without any proof or justifications? How do 
we qualify his unsubstantiated accusation of the Sevryba 
Association in the death of the submariners? 
  It would appear that the captain 1st rank (reserve) found a 
suitable definition for his own acts. 
  5. The journal KHIMIYA I ZHIZN (No. 11, 1990) printed an 
article titled ``Did the ``Komsomolets'' Sink Accidentally?'' by 
Doctor of Physicomathematical Sciences V. N. Mineyev, Candidate 
of Technical Sciences V. V. Korenkov and Candidate of 
Physicomathematical Sciences Yu. N. Tyunyayev. The authors 
assert that ``as in Chernobyl, the disaster aboard the 
``Komsomolets'' was embodied in its design.'' They feel in this 
case that their main argument is the absence of obvious words 
such as ``reliable,'' ``unsinkable'' and ``safe'' from the 
supposedly official name of the submarine 
``Komsomolets''--``experimental torpedo nuclear-powered 
submarine.'' Relax, comrade scientists, everything is in order 
with the official name of the submarine ``Komsomolets''. It was 
named as is required by the warship classification established 
in the navy. Moreover there were no sudden fires in electrical 
equipment aboard the submarine ``Komsomolets'', the fuel and oil 
pipelines didn't crack, oxygen didn't flow into the zone of 
fire, fossil fuel didn't catch fire, and neither titanium, nor 
the powder of gas generators nor torpedo detonators burned. 
There were no explosion, and equally so, there was no iron scale 
or chlorate plugs. And the titanium hull did not heat to a 
temperature of 900-1,100C. 
  According to calculations of specialists, in the entire time 
of the accident around 700 kilograms of flammable 
materials--expressed in units of fossil fuel--burned in 
compartments 6 and 7. In light of this, dear scientists, all of 
your ``calculations'' are far afield of not only chemistry but 
also life. 
  As for flammable materials, unfortunately our science has 
not 
yet created nonflammable paints and varnishes for submarines, 
nonflammable thermal insulation for the pressure hull, 
nonflammable insulation for ship electric cabling, and 
nonflammable oils and supplies, or introduced them into 
production. When it comes to food products, it is true that 
there has been some forward progress: They are still flammable, 
but consuming them as food is already dangerous. 
  Nor are Gosstandart [State Committee for Standards] or the 
ship minister at fault. 
  And of course it is forgivable for you, dear scientists, not 
to know that kingston valves are not installed aboard submarines 
for the purpose of flooding compartments, or that all Soviet 
submarines were equipped with standardized rescue hatches and 
coamings for attachment of rescue craft long before 1971. Nor 
could you have known that the American submarine ``Thrasher'' 
sank not due to ``inadequate underwater unsinkability'' but for 
an entirely different reason. None of this information is 
contained in the adventure novels on the basis of which you 
probably developed your ideas about submarine building. And 
don't recall Admiral S. O. Makarov and Academician A. N. Krylov 
in vain, believe me that submarine designers also understand 
unsinkability and the procedure for designing particular systems 
and entire submarines. 
  By the way, let me state for your information that the term 
``underwater unsinkability'' has not yet been introduced into 
ship building theory and practice. 
  And so, comrade scientists, return to your ``hockey arenas'' 
and play quietly with your little ``pucks.'' All the more so 
because not all of your scientific works and dissertations begin 
with the words ``original,'' ``distinctive'' or ``highly 
scientific.'' And in your free time, it wouldn't be wrong to 
think about why our country, which is first in the world in the 
number of scientists per capita, is in the backwaters of world 
science. To reassure you, let me give you the full official name 
of the submarine ``Komsomolets'': ``deep-sea large 
nuclear-powered torpedo submarine.'' As you can see, this name 
does not contain the ominous term ``intended for 
experimentation'' that troubled you so. 
  6. Something has to be said about the articles written by 
the 
writer N. A. Cherkashin, a former submarine deputy commander for 
political affairs. While I do not feel it necessary to fully 
analyze the author's version of the crew's actions during the 
accident, we do need to examine some of the questions associated 
with the submarine's design, and dwell on just certain aspects 
of this version. 
  The author writes: ``The fire aboard the ``Komsomolets'' was 
altogether unprecedented. It was unique, because the nuclear- 
powered submarine was itself unique: a special hull, navigation 
at very great depth....''[.sup]56[/] It seems that a fire 
depends on the structure and material of the hull, as well as on 
the depth at which a submarine travels. There can be only small 
fires on submarines that do not travel deep, while fires aboard 
submarines with a unique depth of navigation can only be unique. 
How far must we go in the effort to somehow find fault with the 
submarine ``Komsomolets''?! And that's not the only assertion of 
this sort by the writer: ``First about the ship. It was 
noteworthy only in its ability to reach depths beyond those of 
all modern submarines. But at least because it was the first of 
its kind, as is true with all prototype ships, initially the 
``Komsomolets'' needed further design improvements--that is, it 
was not perfect. Even American experts say this.``[.sup]57[/] 
There's logic for you: If its first, then it must be poor. All 
the more so because some mythical ``American experts'' say this. 
  Still, we should be thankful to the writer for his high 
assessment of the deep-sea qualities of the submarine 
``Komsomolets''. As for design concepts not associated with 
deep-sea navigation, they are all standard ones, tested by many 
years of practical Soviet submarine ship building, and they 
correspond to the requirements of the navy, the sector's 
standards, and state standards. Five years of accident-free 
operation confirmed the high operating reliability of the 
submarine, and this time was fully sufficient to reveal any 
deficiencies, if there were any. 
  There is one other statement by the author that cannot be 
ignored: ``The positions of the sides were extremely polarized. 
The builders: The ship was good, and the crew was poorly 
trained. The navy: The ship had flaws, and the crew was 
sufficiently trained.''[.sup]58[/] The author goes on to say: 
``In discussing the causes of the disaster, even the most 
frantic revilers of the unfortunate crew are forced to kick the 
ball through their own goalposts: Accident prevention aboard 
this nuclear-powered submarine remained at the level of previous 
years. There is nothing new in it to protect against electric 
sparks. A single spark can create an inferno. No, when it comes 
to protection from accidents, Soviet designers have not gone 
very far.'' The writer shouldn't have juggled the facts in this 
way, even to prove his dubious version of a conflict between 
industry and the navy. The cited statement of a ``frantic 
reviler'' belongs to Captain 1st Rank (Reserve) A. N. Gorbachev, 
and it was printed in the newspaper KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA (17 
December 1990). As everyone knows, the captain 1st rank 
(reserve) is not a submarine builder, and if he is trying to 
``score a goal,'' he is not at all doing it through his own 
goalposts. The writer knows quite well that such a polarity 
between the sides--the builders versus the navy--does not exist. 
Following the laws of nature as it should, the watershed extends 
vertically, and not horizontally, as the top brass of the navy 
and their proteges try to persuade everyone. 
  Vice Admiral Ye. D. Chernov, Captain 1st Rank Yu. A. 
Zelenskiy, Captain 2d Rank V. V. Stafanovskiy and many other 
submariners are not builders of submarines, but this doesn't 
keep them from making a realistic assessment of the level of 
occupational training of submarine crews. None of the builders 
or submariners named above intended to revile Captain 1st Rank 
Vanin's crew. The crew did everything it could. And this was not 
so much its fault as its misfortune, because there were many 
things that it had not been taught, and many things for which it 
was unprepared. Their reference is to those responsible for the 
weak combat and occupational training of all submarine crews, to 
those who, rather than engaging in honest, open and principled 
dialogue, are hiding behind the backs of the deceased members of 
Captain 1st Rank Vanin's crew, and who are dealing with 
dissidents out of public view. 
  The writer Cherkashin also has specific complaints against 
the design of the submarine ``Komsomolets'': ``Before ``the 
red-hot walls of the pipelines ruptured,'' their plastic gaskets 
melted out, causing the release of high-pressure air into the 
compartment. Before, these gaskets used to be made of 
fire-refined copper (with a far-higher melting point than 
plastic). Pursing the noble goal of economizing the people's 
money, they substituted this nonferrous metal by polyamide, 
omitting the possibility of fire from their calculations.... The 
conditions under which the fire burned aboard the 
``Komsomolets'' had never been encountered before, and I believe 
they wouldn't be encountered if the polyamide gaskets were to be 
substituted by fire-refined copper.''[.sup]59[/] 
  Allow me to inform you, my respected writer, that the sorry 
specialists from the 1st Submarine Flotilla misled you. No one 
ever substituted polyamide gaskets for fire-refined copper ones 
in high-pressure air pipelines. And despite this, the conditions 
under which the fire burned aboard the submarine ``Komsomolets'' 
may recur, especially if the fans of ``unsoiled uniforms'' and 
their defenders continue to close their eyes to the bad state of 
combat and occupational training of submarine crews. 
  It would be pertinent here to cite the following statement 
by 
division deputy commander Captain 1st Rank Kolyada, as presented 
by the writer N. A. Cherkashin: ``The submarine behaved 
normally. The mechanical engineer told me that after the two aft 
compartments (the sixth and the seventh) were flooded, according 
to the stability diagram the ship would have remained 
afloat.''[.sup]60[/] 
  When compartments 6 and 7 are flooded at the same time that 
main ballast tank No. 10 is flooded, the submarine loses 50 
percent of its buoyancy reserve at the stern. This is not 
counting the unblown tank No. 5 and the flooded starboard tank 
No 7. Elementary logic tells us that no submarine can remain 
afloat with such loss of buoyancy and with such an upsetting 
moment. It is hard to say how poorly trained you have to be not 
to understand this simple truth. It was because of this 
professional incompetency that the crew found itself in the 
frigid waters of the Norwegian Sea without rescue equipment, and 
was forced to pay for this with its life. 
  In his effort to show the crew's actions as heroic, 
Cherkashin loses his sense of proportion, and steps beyond all 
permissible limits: ``Not knowing yet whether the submarine was 
sinking or surfacing, the ``keeper of the reactor,'' 
remote-control group commander Captain Lieutenant Igor Orlov 
began shutting down the menacing heart of the nuclear-powered 
submarine. He lowered the shim rods to the lower limit switch 
and quenched the fire of the ``nuclear boiler''.''[.sup]61[/] 
I read this, and I am astonished. Is this a military crew welded 
together by military discipline, or is this an unruly mob in 
which each person can do whatever he likes? It is shameful for 
the former submarine deputy commander for political affairs not 
to know that any action associated with changing a submarine's 
propulsion parameters is made only on the basis of orders from 
the attack center, and not on one's own initiative. As far as 
the specific circumstances are concerned, the reactor was 
stopped by the emergency shielding system when the ship was 
already on the surface. The main task of the operator of the 
main propulsion unit under these conditions is to not ``get 
under foot'' when the automatic system goes into play. We could 
go on with such examples, but what more can you say about an 
author who expands even the abbreviation ``RB'' (radiation 
safety) as ``radioactive underclothing''? 
  7. The newspaper SMENA (15 April 1990) carried an article by 
Captain 1st Rank (Retired) V. A. Boyko titled ``No Culprits as 
Usual?'' Everything the author says is clear and as simple as it 
can be. Submarines must have the ``tenacity'' ``not to sink as a 
result of any kind of fire,'' and fire extinguishing equipment 
must put fires out ``with maximum possible force.'' The matter 
of designing such submarines, Boyko believes, is simple, it is 
something ``that is taught in basic courses at ship building 
VUZes.'' 
  However, rather than designing such submarines, designers, 
builders, testers, recipients and operating executives 
``administer justice over crews, laying emphasis not on saving 
people but on their own prestige and well-being.'' And as for 
mistakes made by personnel, ``certain mistakes have always been 
made and will continue to be made in such difficult stressful, 
life-threatening situations.'' Such is his position. And one 
unwittingly thinks that perhaps the designing of submarines 
needs to be assigned to students dropped for poor performance, 
and their operation should be given over to cadets who have not 
undergone the full course of training, to whom it was explained 
in the first year that it is harmful and dangerous to make 
mistakes. Fortunately, however, V. A. Boyko himself leads us out 
of this dead end. As it turns out, in order to create submarines 
with ``tenacity,'' we need to first ``improve the concept of and 
requirements on submarine survivability,'' and not until this 
should we ``realize them in design and construction, and test 
them out in trials and during certification--thus designing 
submarines with tenacity.'' Then it would be up to the 
``specialist on survivability,'' as the captain 1st rank 
(retired) refers to himself. He is in a better position to know 
how imperfect the concepts of and requirements on submarine 
design are in relation to survivability. Captain 1st Rank 
(Retired) Boyko served most of his career behind the walls of 
Naval Institute No 1, which develops such ``imperfect concepts 
of and requirements'' on survivability. 
  As for specific complaints regarding the design of the 
submarine ``Komsomolets'', there is nothing to say--Boyko simply 
didn't have any. It is obviously easier to talk about complaints 
in general-- this requires neither substantiation of these 
complaints, nor even their existence. 
  8. An open letter written by Captain 1st Rank B. G. Kolyada 
and his associates[.sup]62[/] cites specific ``deficiencies'' 
of the submarine which, in the opinion of the authors influenced 
the tragedy's outcome. Let's examine these ``deficiencies.'' 
  ``The absence of an integrated system aboard the ship for 
estimating the situation in the distressed compartment on the 
basis of objective data, especially in the absence or 
incapacitation of personnel, made it impossible to estimate the 
situation in the distressed compartment in the first minute,'' 
the captain 1st rank announces. Could the authors of the remark 
explain to me what this ``integrated system for estimating the 
system in the distressed compartment'' is? What is it that it 
must estimate integrally, on the basis of what objective data, 
and in what units of measurement? 
  Fire detection equipment was foreseen aboard the submarine 
``Komsomolets''. The fire was reported by the watchstander for 
compartment 7, and there were objective warning signals 
indicating an increase in temperature in compartment 7 and low 
insulation resistance in the electrical system. Objective 
information on the fire in compartment 7 could have been 
obtained with the television camera, had the television system 
been working. Is this really not enough to be able to classify 
the fire in compartment 7? If it isn't, then what do we make of 
the command issued at 1103 to deliver fire extinguisher into 
compartment 7? Analysis of the personnel's actions shows that 
throughout the entire time of the accident, the attack center of 
the ``Komsomolets'' was unable to really estimate the situation 
in the distressed compartments, to really monitor the 
submarine's buoyancy and stability, and to take real steps to 
fight for its survival. All of this affected the accident's 
outcome. The absence of ``an integrated system for estimating 
the situation'' has no relevance to this. 
  All of this does not exclude the need for improving existing 
equipment for detecting fires in compartments. As for an 
integrated system for estimating the situation, no ship of the 
navy has such a system. Not even the concept of such a system 
has been developed, and exploratory research in support of its 
creation has not been conducted. Thus any talk today about such 
a system is pointless. 
  The authors of the letter have other complaints against the 
structures of the submarine: ``The situation was aggravated by 
design deficiencies, to wit: The LOKh system; the standard 
system for relieving excess pressure in distressed compartments; 
an integrated system that would help the personnel to forecast 
the possible development of events in extreme situations on the 
basis of objective data; the impossibility of controlling the 
airtightness of compartments from the control room.'' 
  Let's examine these design deficiencies. 
  The detail design of the submarine ``Komsomolets'' was 
developed to include an LOKh firefighting system equipped with 
remote control from the control room. However, because of the 
supposedly insufficient reliability of remotely controlled 
electromagnetic valves, a joint decision of the USSR Ministry of 
Ship Building Industry and the navy in 1975 prescribed a 
transition to manual control of the LOKh aboard all submarines. 
After the new valves were developed, in 1987 the navy placed an 
assignment to study installation of a remote-controlled LOKh 
system in submarines, but for some unknown reasons a decision 
was made not to introduce a remote-controlled LOKh system into 
the ``Komsomolets''. Such are the facts. 
  Remote control of the LOKh firefighting system is absent 
today from all submarines, and this must be considered in ship 
operation. 
  All submarines also lack a special system for relieving 
pressure from distressed compartments. Such a system does not 
exist in the navy's requirements on submarine design. Thus it 
would be wrong to refer to something that was never ordered as a 
design deficiency. In the best case this may be viewed as a 
proposal for study. 
  In addition Article 275 of the RBZh-PL-82 foresees 
development of recommendations on relieving pressure from 
distressed compartments. The leadership of submarine formations 
is responsible for such development. As the division deputy 
commander Captain 1st Rank Kolyada bears a certain amount of 
responsibility for the fact that such recommendations were not 
drawn up for the submarine ``Komsomolets''. 
  There is no need to bring up the fact that not a single 
submarine of the navy has an integrated system for forecasting 
possible development of events in extreme situations on the 
basis of objective data. The concept has not been developed, and 
exploratory research in support of creating such a system has 
not been conducted. During the accident the leadership of the 
submarine ``Komsomolets'' did not undertake any action to 
measure the parameters of the ship's attitude or determine the 
elements of its buoyancy and stability, which would have made it 
possible to forecast the accident's development. Given such a 
passive attitude toward ship damage control, no integrated 
systems of any kind can help. 
  No submarines of the navy have a system for controlling the 
airtightness of compartments from the control room (with the 
exception of a certain class of submarine with a limited number 
of personnel). Development of such systems for manned 
compartments is not foreseen in the navy's requirements on 
submarine design. 
  Thus even this ``design deficiency'' can be treated only as 
a 
proposal for development. Introduction of such a system into a 
submarine would be equivalent to complicating the design, 
increasing the weight and size characteristics of the equipment, 
and reducing its reliability. In addition the system may turn 
out to be unserviceable in emergency situations due to failure 
of control circuits. As for the degree to which these negative 
indicators could be compensated by the anticipated increase in 
submarine survivability, the answer to this question can be 
provided only through meticulous design development. 
  At the same time remote control of the airtightness of 
compartments cannot solve the problem completely. Analysis of 
the actions taken by personnel of the submarine ``Komsomolets'' 
during the accident showed that the submarine's leadership had 
not given the order promptly to take the main turbogear unit 
(GTZA) off line, and then to seal off the bulkhead of 
compartment 7. The operator at the console of the main 
propulsion unit did not shut the kingston valve of the 
stern-tube gland's cooling system, which is equipped with remote 
control. The mains were not closed throughout the entire time of 
the accident, even though closing them manually did not present 
any difficulty. Hence follows the same simple conclusion: No 
technical tricks will help in the absence of the needed combat 
and occupational training of the crew. 
  Summarizing all of the ``design deficiencies'' of the 
submarine ``Komsomolets'' stated by Captain 1st Rank Kolyada, we 
can make the following conclusions: Not one of the indicated 
``deficiencies'' could have been a cause of the accident; these 
``deficiencies'' are inherent to all or most submarines of the 
navy. 
  9. In conclusion we need to examine the ``numerous design 
imperfections'' revealed in the investigation of the accident 
aboard the submarine ``Komsomolets''. Despite the fact that the 
navy's top brass wielded these ``numerous imperfections'' wildly 
like a Neanderthal club, they never were officially presented to 
the designer. Nor did the government commission officially 
present them. Therefore we will have to use unofficial materials. 
  The list of ``design imperfections'' was signed by naval 
deputy commander-in-chief V. V. Zaytsev and it is called 
``Submarine Design Peculiarities Influencing, in the Navy's 
Opinion, the Advent and Development of Large and Fast-Developing 
Fires and Hindering Ship Damage Control.'' It is presented in 
its entirety at the end of the book. We will limit ourselves for 
the moment only to the conclusions based on the results of 
analyzing this list. 
  None of the ``design peculiarities'' could have caused the 
accident and the demise of the submarine. 
  The ``consequences'' indicated by the authors do not reflect 
the actual circumstances of the accident, and they are directed 
at justifying the inactivity of the submarine's leadership in 
ship damage control, and at covering up the mistakes it made. 
  Certain items of the ``Design Peculiarities'' may be used in 
design development as a way to determine the possibilities for 
improving equipment and finding new technical concepts that 
would increase ship survivability and reduce the probability of 
incorrect actions by personnel. 
  You can agree or disagree with these conclusions. But if the 
highly placed authors of the navy's remarks believe that all of 
these ``design peculiarities'' caused the accident and demise of 
the submarine ``Komsomolets'', and if they do nothing to 
prohibit patrol duty by submarines having such 
``peculiarities,'' then what should we call them--criminals or 
liars? There is no third choice in this case. It would be 
permissible to ask: How can the navy allow such submarines to 
operate? Won't there be more fires, won't more ships sink, and 
won't more people die? 
  The government commission left unaddressed many pieces of 
equipment and devices having deficiencies that were discussed in 
the examination of the circumstances of the accident aboard the 
submarine ``Komsomolets'': 
  the self-contained emergency buoy failed to operate after 
the 
submarine's demise; 
  the sunken submarine locator failed to operate; 
  the inflating system of the PSN-20 life rafts failed to work 
completely, ``by the book''; 
  the survival suits and diving suits are hard to use; 
  the face masks of the IDA-59 apparatus are uncomfortable and 
unreliable. 
  We should also add to this list the ``Listvennitsa'' 
loudspeaker communication system, although it has already been 
discussed. 
  These are all different items of equipment, but there is one 
common trait that unites them. All of these items of equipment 
were designed on the basis of specifications of the navy's 
institutes, and under their observation and leadership. The navy 
accepted this equipment as armament and as supply items. The 
questions that arise in this connection are: Aren't there a 
little too many negative remarks regarding equipment for which 
the navy bears responsibility, and is there in fact ``something 
rotten in Denmark''? And could it be that concern for the 
``cleanliness of the uniform'' has overshadowed concern for 
creating reliable equipment? There's some ``food for thought'' 
for you. 
  Now a few words about measures to increase fire protection 
to 
submarines and exclude accidents aboard them, developed on the 
basis of the results of examining the circumstances of the 
accident aboard the submarine ``Komsomolets'', and accepted for 
implementation. 
  A joint decision of the USSR Ministry of Ship Building 
Industry and the naval leadership foresees development of a 
large number of measures directed at raising the fire safety and 
survivability of submarines, at developing documentation and at 
designing crew training equipment. As for the degree to which 
these measures will be implemented and by when, and how much 
they will help to increase the survivability of ships and 
improve crew training, life will show. However, many years will 
pass before there can be any discussion of results. 
In August 1990 the USSR Council of Ministers published a 
decree on the results of the examination of the circumstances 
behind the accident aboard the submarine ``Komsomolets'', 
drafted by the naval leadership. It contains measures for 
creating training centers and for improving ship basing and 
technical maintenance conditions, it foresees fulfillment of a 
large number of scientific research and experimental design 
projects, and it doesn't forget the social sphere either. 
  But there's one thing that raises questions: The deadline 
for 
fulfilling measures to organize training centers and to improve 
submarine basing and technical maintenance conditions, and 
measures in the social sphere, has been extended to the year 
2000, and most of the funds for scientific research and 
experimental design work (up to 75 percent) are to be spent on 
projects having nothing to do with the fire safety of submarines 
or their survivability, or with designing individual protective 
and rescue equipment for submariners. Nor is optimism raised by 
the nonspecific nature of measures to create training centers 
and establish submarine basing and technical maintenance 
conditions. The planned purchase of 50,000 survival suits abroad 
evokes bewilderment in light of the cheerful assertions by Vice 
Admiral R. L. Dymov, chief of the navy's search and rescue 
service, that series production of Russian-made survival suits 
will begin in 1991.[.sup]63[/] 
  Naval commander-in-chief Fleet Admiral V. N. Chernavin said 
nothing about this in his interview with the journal MORSKOY 
SBORNIK (No. 12, 1990). The tone of the statements is optimistic 
and confident. This immediately brings to mind Vice Admiral V. 
V. Zaytsev's ``classical'' pronouncement: ``Confident reports 
prior to 1635 indicate that ship damage control efforts were 
proceeding according to plan, that the situation aboard the 
submarine was being monitored, and that entry of water into the 
pressure hull was not noted.'' 
  The ``secret'' stamp applied to decisions makes it very easy 
to produce such ``confident'' reports. But as for what awaits us 
after ``1635,'' time will tell. 
  And in conclusion it would be somewhat interesting to 
compare 
the position of specialists of the U.S. Navy with the position 
of specialists of our country's navy regarding the accident rate 
aboard ship. Here is what is said about this in an article 
written by the ``troubadour'' of the navy's leadership--Captain 
1st Rank S. I. Bystrov, editor of the naval department of the 
newspaper KRASNAYA ZVEZDA:[.sup]64[/] ``Late last year 
specialists of the U.S. Navy came up with proposals which in 
their opinion could help to reduce the accident rate. Principal 
among them are: raising the theoretical level of personnel 
training, improving the practical skills of servicemen in 
maintaining combat activity, introducing computerized trainers 
into the training process, and intensifying naval supervision 
over construction and repair of warships. The priority with 
which these proposals are listed deserves attention: The 
problems of improving personnel skills are addressed by three of 
them. And this is in the professional American navy.'' What can 
we say about these proposals? The adherence to principles and 
high civic-mindedness of specialists of the U.S. Navy in the 
performance of their duty evoke respect. It is immediately 
evident that people are working, rather than looking for others 
to blame. And now let's listen to our own specialists: ``Our 
compulsory-service seamen have not permitted as many accidents 
as American professionals. And what the Americans put in last 
place regarding influence upon the accident rate--the 
reliability of equipment, is in first place in our country.'' 
  What fine recruits we have! They've certainly tweaked the 
noses of those celebrated American professionals. Naturally with 
such fine men, only the equipment can be to blame. But the 
finest man of all is Captain 1st Rank S. I. Bystrov. How 
expertly he plays up to our generals and admirals who oppose a 
professional army! And industry is not forgotten either. He also 
has some ``good things to say'' about it. Though somewhat 
condescendingly, of course, in passing: ``And by the way, there 
can be no argument when it comes to recognizing the services of 
our industry.'' Well thanks for that, considering that designers 
and ship builders are something less than fine. 
  Appealing to all ``not to shift blame on anyone, but to 
objectively analyze all of it and implement effective, 
economically supported and rooted measures,'' with army 
straight-forwardness the author proposes the sequence in which 
this ``objectivity'' should be exercised: ``First of all, 
perfecting the design, technical reliability and quality of our 
ships, making damage control equipment and rescue resources 
effective, and upgrading the quality of personnel training.'' 
  How appropriate it is to repeat the captain 1st rank's 
pronouncement here, though in somewhat amended form. The order 
in which he lists the problems deserves attention: Those of 
upgrading equipment quality are addressed by three of them. 
  Captain 1st Rank (Retired) V. A. Boyko expressed the naval 
leadership's position more clearly: ``Let's build sufficiently 
viable submarines with full crew rescue support at the level of 
the best world accomplishments. And after that we can talk about 
the mistakes of personnel.''[.sup]65[/] 
  What they say is apparently true: ``A wise person learns 
from 
other's mistakes, while a fool has no desire to learn from his 
own.'' 
  Let submariners understand me correctly: Equipment, and 
especially military equipment, has to undergo constant 
improvement, regardless of accidents or any other circumstances. 
But the main thing today is to raise the level of crew combat 
and occupational training, to improve the quality of ship 
technical maintenance, and to solve all problems associated with 
these objectives. Here lies the fundamental difference between 
the leadership of the military- industrial complex and, in 
Captain 1st Rank Bystrov's terminology, ``one of the interested 
parties that is unfortunately opposed to the navy.'' 
<H5>  ``Design Peculiarities'' of the Submarine ``Komsomolets'' </H5>
  Looking over the list of the navy's Main Directorate for 
Operation and Repair, ``Submarine Design Peculiarities 
Influencing, in the Navy's Opinion, the Advent and Development 
of Large and Fast- Developing Fires and Hindering Ship Damage 
Control,'' we can make the following conclusions. 
  1. ``Placement of three oil tanks, an oil separating 
unit and reserves of GPD (30 units) and regeneration resources 
(10 cans) in compartment 7, which contains a large amount of 
electrical equipment (power panels), the absence of an oil 
cleaning system, and presence of a large number of openings 
communicating with the outside. Distribution panels in power 
compartments are not protected from the influence of oil vapor. 
The requirements of the TPPL-75, articles 11.4.2, 11.4.14, 
11.4.15, 11.4.16, 11.4.18, 11.4.19 regarding the location of 
electrical equipment, and of Article 11.4.26 requiring 
installation of resources for removing oil vapor from air at the 
locations of electrical equipment, are not satisfied. 
  The consequences: 
  This resulted in a decrease in fire and explosion 
safety, saturation with oil vapor, and the advent and rapid 
development of the fire.'' 
  The designer's conclusion. 
  1. There were 49 alternating current distribution panels, 
nine direct current distribution panels, four alternating 
current main distribution panels and one direct current main 
distribution panel--that is, 63 distribution panels--within the 
electric power system of the submarine ``Komsomolets''. Presence 
of four distribution panels and one section of the main 
distribution panel in compartment 7 cannot be said to be ``a 
large amount,'' given an average density of 10.5 distribution 
panels per compartment (distribution panels are not located in 
the reactor compartment). Such placement of panels is 
characteristic of all of the navy's submarines, and it is not a 
peculiarity of the submarine ``Komsomolets''. 
  2. For practical purposes there was only one tank containing 
turbine oil in compartment 7 of the submarine, and not three--a 
9 m[.sup]3[/] reserve oil tank, because the 7 m[.sup]3[/] 
dirty oil tank is not filled with oil, and it is used only to 
replace oil in the GTZA (in this case the reserve tank is dried 
out completely), and the 0.8 m[.sup]3[/] emergency oil drain 
tank does not communicate with compartment 7 (instructions 
K-902-022 TO). The reserve and dirty oil tanks are equipped with 
ventilation, oil traps and shut-offs making it possible to 
disconnect these tanks from compartment 7 in the event of fire 
(instruction K-902-032 TO). The temperature of oil in the 
reserve tank did not exceed a figure between +3 and +5C 
during the cruise under normal operating conditions, which 
precluded any evolution of oil vapor from it. The oil reserve's 
location in the aft compartment is not a peculiarity of the 
submarine ``Komsomolets''. Nor is location of the oil separating 
unit and of reserves of damage control and regenerating 
resources in compartment 7 a peculiarity. There are no 
restrictions on their location in aft compartments. Regenerating 
reserves must be located in each compartment according to naval 
requirements. Tests carried out by the government commission's 
working group proved the GPD resources to be highly fire- and 
explosion-safe. As for the overall amount of equipment, 
compartment 7 aboard the ``Komsomolets'' has less than any of 
the others. This is obviously why compartment 7 was loaded with 
reserves of food and supplies before the ship's cruise, even 
though the design does not foresee their storage in the 
compartment. 
  3. The assertions of the authors of the remark that 
compartment 7 contained a large number of openings communicating 
with the outside is inconsistent with reality. There are 
significantly fewer such openings aboard the ``Komsomolets'' 
than in other submarines of the navy. In particular there are 53 
openings in the pressure hull in the aft compartment of a 
certain third-generation submarine with a compartment 7 of the 
same size as that in the ``Komsomolets''. The number of openings 
is even greater in other submarines in which the aft 
compartments are larger. There were only 38 openings in the 
pressure hull in compartment 7 of the submarine ``Komsomolets''. 
  4. The assertion of the authors of the remark that the 
distribution panels aboard the submarine ``Komsomolets'' are not 
protected from the influence of oil vapor is inconsistent with 
reality. Power production equipment (the GTZA in compartment 6 
and TTsNA in compartment 5) producing free vapor from hot oil 
(temperatures up to 70C) is supplied with self-contained 
units for removing oil vapor from air. In addition the air of 
power compartments is purified of oil vapor by compartment air 
conditioning equipment containing FK-U cassette filters rated 
for oil vapor absorption. The equipment in compartment 7 did not 
produce any free hot oil vapor, making it unnecessary to install 
a self-contained oil cleaning unit. This is why compartment air 
conditioning equipment containing the indicated cassette filters 
was used to remove oil vapor from air in compartment 7. This 
system for removing oil vapor from air is also used aboard other 
submarines of the navy, and the ``Komsomolets'' is not unique in 
this. It should be noted that such combination of the functions 
of the air conditioning and cleaning system is to be expanded by 
measures for increasing the fire safety of the navy's submarines 
(decision No. S-13/1788, 22 September 1989, of the USSR Ministry 
of Ship Building Industry and the navy, item 9 in the 
attachment). 
  Five years of the submarine's operation demonstrated the 
effectiveness of the system for removing oil vapor from the air 
of compartments. In all of the time that the ``Komsomolets'' was 
in operation, not a single case of oil getting on equipment in 
any compartment was documented. 
  5. The complaints of the authors of the remark that the 
designers failed to satisfy the requirements of the TPPL-75 
[Submarine Design Requirements] are wrong. These TPPL were 
published by the navy in 1976 without coordinating them with 
industry. The detail design of the submarine ``Komsomolets'' had 
already been approved by this time (1972), and the shop drawings 
were practically finished. No decisions were made regarding the 
procedure and time of introduction of the TPPL-75. Thus these 
TPPL-75 were not introduced on any submarine of the navy. In 
1981 they were replaced by the ``Basic Technical Requirements'' 
OTT-6.1.1-81. The submarine ``Komsomolets'' was designed in 
accordance with specifications approved in 1966, and the TPPL-67 
submarine design requirements, developed by the navy. As far as 
the essence of the question is concerned, all requirements of 
articles 11.4.2, 11.4.14, 11.4.15, 11.4.16, 11.4.18, 11.4.19, 
11.4.26 of the TPPL-75 were satisfied in the submarine 
``Komsomolets'', with the exception of requirements on using 
KMZh cable in emergency electric power networks. Because such 
cable was difficult to manufacture, it was not used aboard any 
submarine. 
  6. The ``consequences'' of imagined peculiarities of the 
submarine ``Komsomolets'' dreamed up by the authors are also 
inconsistent with reality. The high fire and explosion safety of 
this ship was confirmed by a hands-on inspection of its 
condition in the period from 11 to 20 October 1983 by an expert 
commission appointed by the navy. The fire and explosion safety 
of compartment 7 diminished as a result of unauthorized storage 
of provisions and supplies in it and uncontrolled delivery of 
oxygen into the compartment in the presence of a faulty oxygen 
gas analyzer. An elevated oxygen concentration in the 
compartment (estimated at up to 30 percent) led to the advent 
and intensive development of fire. As far as saturation of the 
compartment with oil vapor is concerned, calculations carried 
out by the Central Scientific Research Institute imeni A. N. 
Krylov and the Naval Institute No. 1 demonstrated that it is 
impossible for oil vapor to reach even the lower concentration 
limit of ignition when the temperature in the compartment is 
70C (the actual temperature was around 20C) and when 
air cleaning units are not working. 
  These facts allow us to say that all of the complaints of 
the 
authors of the remarks are unjustified, and that they are 
inconsistent with real circumstances. 
  2. The design precluded airtightness of compartments 6 
and 7 when the shafting was operating because of the presence of 
transit oil feed and drain lines of the main propulsion unit and 
the gap in the shafting's bulkhead gland. The requirements of 
items X-75 and 11.6.4 of the TPPL-67 and TPPL-75 respectively 
regarding the airtightness of bulkheads when shafting is 
operating under normal conditions and at elevated pressure were 
not satisfied. 
  Recommendations of the design office regarding the use 
of the submarine's equipment in emergency situations, 
21.GGK-E-478-82, do not foresee closure of valves on oil 
pipelines when sealing compartment 7. In addition the design 
office did not draw up instructions, to be included in the 
operating documents, on testing the airtightness of 
intercompartment submarine bulkheads with a vacuum of 100 mm Hg 
(see Article 201, RBZh-PL-82). 
  The consequences: 
  This led to an increase and spread of pressure and a 
fire in compartment 6, as well as gas contamination of 
compartments 2, 3 and 5.'' 
  The designer's conclusion: 
  1. The assertion of the authors of this remark that the 
design did not provide for sealing of compartments 6 and 7 when 
the shafting is operating is inconsistent with reality, as is 
true of the assertion that there is some sort of ``gap in the 
bulkhead gland.'' The shafting of the submarine ``Komsomolets'' 
is designed in full correspondence with Article X-75 of the 
TPPL-67, which contains no requirement regarding the 
airtightness of bulkheads when shafting is operating at elevated 
pressure, as is asserted by the authors of the remark. The 
shafting was designed on the basis of standard plans, and it 
contains no ``design peculiarities'' in comparison with other 
submarines as far as the main thrust bearing (GUP) lubricating 
system and the bulkhead gland are concerned. 
  2. The reference of the authors of the remark to the 
requirements of the TPPL-75 is wrong for the reasons set forth 
in the designer's conclusion regarding item 1. As far as the 
essence of the issue is concerned, the bulkhead between 
compartments 6 and 7 is airtight aboard the submarine 
``Komsomolets'' when the shafting is operating under normal 
conditions and at elevated pressure (within normal conditions). 
  The authors of the remark incorrectly interpret the meaning 
of the requirements of Article 11.6.4 of the TPPL-75 regarding 
elevated pressure. The article discusses only elevated pressure 
under normal operating conditions, and nothing else. There are 
no requirements in the article on the airtightness of the 
operating shafting under emergency conditions, nor are there any 
references to the magnitude of the corresponding elevated 
pressure. 
  3. The attempt to criticize the ``Recommendations'' 
21.GGK-E-478-82 drawn up by the designer is wrong, because they 
were not intended for use by submarine personnel. The 
recommendations were drawn up in response to an assignment from 
the Naval Institute No. 1 specially to serve as the basis upon 
which this institute was to draw up the ``Manual on Combat Use 
of Technical Resources'' (RBITS)-- one of the fundamental 
documents of the set of submarine damage control documents. 
However, the RBITS never was written by the Naval Institute No. 
1, and the navy's Main Directorate for Operation and Repair did 
not plan or support its development for the ``Komsomolets'' in 
time. 
  The assertions of the authors of the remark that the 
recommendations lack instructions on closing valves on oil 
pipelines are inconsistent with reality. Closure of these valves 
is not foreseen in the general section on sealing the bulkheads, 
because this affects submarine power and must be carried out on 
the basis of a decision of the control room (Article 89, 
RBZh-PL-82). In the event of fire in compartment 7, the 
``Recommendations'' (items 3.3 and 3.20) provide instructions on 
deenergizing (that is, shutting down) the oil pumps of the 
lubricating system of the main turbogear unit (GTZA) and 
shutting down the unit itself. The instructions on servicing the 
GTZA oil system make a reference to closing valves on the oil 
pipeline when oil pumps are shut down in order to seal the 
bulkhead between compartments 6 and 7 (instruction K-902-022 TO, 
items 2.3.1 and 2.5.4). 
  4. The complaint of the authors of the remark that the 
absence of instructions on testing the airtightness of the 
submarine's intercompartment bulkheads with a 100 mm Hg vacuum 
is unjustified. The designer's operating and design documents do 
not foresee testing a submarine's intercompartment bulkheads for 
airtightness with a 100 mm Hg vacuum, and there is nothing in 
Article 201 of the RBZh-PL-82 that says that such a test must be 
conducted on the basis of the designer's documentation. Moreover 
nothing makes such testing an official requirement. 
  5. The ``consequences'' dreamed up by the authors are 
inconsistent with reality. The rise in pressure and the fire in 
compartment 6 were the result of the failure of the attack 
center to satisfy the requirements of articles 89 and 121 of the 
RBZh-PL-82 concerning shut-down of the main turbogear unit, 
disconnection of the high- pressure air mains entering the 
distressed compartment, and bleeding overboard the air reserve 
out of the emergency cofferdam of the high-pressure air main, 
located in compartment 7, and they were not the result of any 
mythical peculiarities in the design of the shafting. The 
absence of the RBITS played a negative role in this matter. The 
assertions that these peculiarities resulted in gas 
contamination of compartments 2, 3 and 5 are simply absurd, 
because the shafting is not associated with these compartments 
in any way. Compartments 2, 3 and 5 were contaminated with gas 
through unclosed mains because the personnel failed to satisfy 
the requirements of articles 89 and 90 of the RBZh-PL-82. 
  3. ``The design does not allow for sealing of the 
bulkhead between compartments 5 and 6 from the direction of 
compartment 5 due to the absence of valves in compartment 5 on 
the system for supplying vapor to the gasket in the system 
removing the vapor-air mixture from TTsNA No. 1, 2. 
  The consequences: 
  This resulted in gas contamination of compartment 5, an 
increase in pressure in it and subsequent ignition of oil vapor, 
and the death of people in the compartment due to burns.'' 
  The designer's conclusion: 
  1. The design does not provide for sealing off the pipeline 
of the system removing vapor-air mixture from gaskets of the 
turbocirculation pumps from the direction of compartment 5, 
which was a mistake of the designer. 
  2. The ``consequences'' presented by the authors are 
inconsistent with reality: 
  the personnel had not closed the clinket gates on the line 
carrying spent vapor from the turbocirculation pumps (300 mm 
diameter), which practically excluded the influence of the 
suction system pipeline (50 mm diameter) on entry of gas into 
compartment 5 through gaskets of the turbocirculation pumps; 
  the high rate of growth of pressure in compartment 5 in the 
initial period of the accident and confinement of the 
deflagration just to the upper part of the compartment's central 
passage permit the assertion that oil vapor or products of 
incomplete combustion may have entered compartment 5 not through 
the suction system leading from the gaskets of the 
turbocirculation pumps, which is located along the sides of the 
compartment, but out of the oil tank supplying these pumps when 
combustion products from compartment 7 were blown through it 
into the oil separation line, which had not been reset in its 
initial position after work. Products of incomplete combustion 
may have entered compartment 6 through the pressure equalizing 
valve between compartments 5 and 6, which is constantly open 
under normal operation. The turbocirculation pump oil tank vents 
and the pressure equalizing valve are located in the upper part 
of the central passage. Later on these sources of hot gases were 
closed by the submarine's personnel, which for practical 
purposes stopped the growth of pressure in compartment 5; 
  the assertion of the authors of the remark that this mistake 
by the designer led to the death of personnel due to burns is a 
deliberate lie. The personnel of compartment 5 (Warrant Officer 
S. S. Bondar and Seaman V. Yu. Kulapin) died not of burns but as 
a result of carbon monoxide poisoning through their ShDA 
equipment due to mistakes made by the attack center and the 
compartment 5 commander. Air supply to the medium-pressure air 
main was stopped at the direction of the attack center without 
notifying personnel wearing ShDA masks and using air from the 
medium-pressure air system. The commander of compartment 5 
failed to monitor operation of the stationary breathing system, 
which supplied air to ShDA equipment from the high- or 
medium-pressure air system. After the entire air reserve in 
cofferdam No. 4, located in compartment 7, was bled away as a 
result of the fire, and the supply of air to the medium- 
pressure air line was cut off, poisoned air from compartment 7 
began entering compartment 5's stationary breathing system 
through one of the pipelines (high- or medium-pressure air) and 
then into the ShDA equipment. Warrant Officer Bondar and Seaman 
Kulapin, who were connected up to ShDA equipment, were poisoned 
by carbon monoxide. Because of delays in evacuating the victims 
the poisoning was irreversible. 
  4.``The design did not provide for remote delivery of 
fire extinguisher from the LOKh system into the distressed 
compartment by the attack center (the requirements of Article 
XI-37 of the TPPL-67, Article 12.2.34 of the TPPL-75, and 
Article 1.5.6.22 of the OTT6.1.1-81 were not satisfied). 
  The consequences: 
  This made it impossible to use fire extinguisher from 
the LOKh station in compartment 7 to put out the fire, and it 
may have led to unjustified delay in delivering fire 
extinguisher from compartment 6 into compartment 7, had the 
roving watchstander been in compartment 4 or 5.'' 
  The designer's conclusion: 
  1. The detail design for the submarine ``Komsomolets'' was 
drawn up with an LOKh system that could be started remotely from 
the attack center in accordance with requirements of the 
specifications and the TPPL-67. Later on, citing insufficient 
reliability of remotely controlled electromagnetic valves, 
decision No. S-13/002834, 17 October 1975, of the USSR Ministry 
of Ship Building Industry and the navy prescribed replacement of 
these valves aboard all submarines by manually controlled 
fittings, which is what was done on the ``Komsomolets''. 
  The OST [All-Union Standard] on designing the LOKh 
firefighting system was corrected on the basis of this decision. 
A manually started LOKh system is used on most submarines, and 
therefore the assertion of the authors of the remark that this 
was a peculiarity of the submarine ``Komsomolets'' is 
inconsistent with reality. 
  2. It should be noted that the USSR Ministry of Ship 
Building 
Industry and the navy ordered the designers (on the basis of 
decision No. 1/02095, 4 August 1987) to complete design 
developments in support of introducing remotely started LOKh 
systems aboard submarines. This decision was based on the 
results of developing a new remotely controlled valve for the 
LOKh system. In this case for unknown reasons the navy decided 
not to install the system in the submarine ``Komsomolets'', and 
it did not foresee completion of these developments for this 
ship. It is consequently wrong for the navy to lodge any 
complaints about the absence of a remotely started LOKh system 
aboard the submarine ``Komsomolets''. 
  3. The reference of the authors of the remark to 
requirements 
of the TPPL-75 is wrong for the reasons set forth in the 
conclusion regarding item 1. The same can also be said for the 
requirements of the OTT6.1.1-81. As for the essence of the 
issue, the requirements of Article 12.2.34 of the TPPL-75 and 
Article 1.5.6.22 of the OTT6.1.1-81 have to do with remote 
starting of the LOKh system (remote control), and not with 
remote delivery of fire extinguisher by the attack center, as 
the authors of the remark assert. Moreover the requirements of 
the OTT6.1.1-81, which were issued in place of the TPPL-75, 
allow starting of the LOKh system both from the attack center 
remotely and from the compartments, including manually. 
  5. ``The submarine design did not foresee a system with 
the necessary freon reserve for fast recharging of any LOKh 
station to provide for repeated delivery of freon to a 
distressed compartment in the presence of large fires in order 
to create a fire-quenching concentration. In addition the 
operating documents (instructions on operating the LOKh system) 
say nothing about the loss of fire extinguishing properties when 
high pressure is present in a distressed compartment. Other 
resources capable of extinguishing a fire at elevated pressure 
are not foreseen by the submarine's design. 
  The consequences: 
  A fire-quenching concentration of freon could not be 
created in compartments 6 and 7, and the fire could not be put 
out. The submarine lacks resources for extinguishing a fire at 
compartment pressures exceeding 2 kg/cm[.sup]2[/].'' 
  The designer's conclusion: 
  1. The LOKh system in the submarine ``Komsomolets'' was 
developed in full correspondence with naval requirements OTT MO 
6.1.17-79, Part II, and OST V5.5059-81, which do not foresee 
installation of tanks containing a reserve of freon. The 
complaints of the authors of the remark can be viewed only as a 
proposal for development. 
  2. None of the navy's submarines has containers with a freon 
reserve, and this is also not a peculiarity of the submarine 
``Komsomolets''. 
  3. It is unsuitable to place reserve freon containers aboard 
submarines because attempts to recharge stations in an emergency 
situation could only aggravate the emergency situation aboard 
the ship. 
  4. The instructions on operating the LOKh system were 
developed for the submarine ``Komsomolets'' in accordance with 
standard instructions coordinated with the navy, which say 
nothing about the fire extinguishing characteristics of freon. 
Nor is anything said in the operating instructions of LOKh 
systems in other submarines of the navy. It does not make any 
sense to introduce this information into LOKh system operations, 
because the instructions are not part of the set of submarine 
damage control documents. Information on the fire extinguishing 
characteristics of freon and on the range of uses of the LOKh 
system should be contained in the RBZh-PL-82, which is the 
principal submarine damage control document, in attachment No. 
3, ``Firefighting Resources.'' And who's the author of the 
RBZh-PL-82? The navy. 
  5. There are no other resources in the country today that 
are 
highly effective in putting out fires in the presence of 
elevated pressure. Experimental design work aimed at creating 
such resources is in its initial stage. Consequently any 
discussion of the absence of these resources aboard the 
submarine ``Komsomolets'' is pointless and totally meaningless. 
  6. The assertions of the authors of the remark that a fire 
extinguishing concentration of freon could not be created in 
compartments 6 and 7 because of the absence of freon reserves 
aboard the submarine are unfounded. Freon had not in fact been 
delivered to compartment 7, and its delivery into compartment 6 
did not begin until after the fire went out. 
  6. ``The design does not foresee protection of electric 
circuits between synchro transmitters and synchro receivers of 
the ``Korund'' system from short-circuit currents (the 
requirements of Article VII-7 of the TPPL-67, Article 8.2.7 of 
the TPPL-75, and articles 1.3.3.1 and 1.3.3.6 of the OTT6.1.1-81 
were violated). 
  The consequences: 
  This resulted in a fire in the GKP, which complicated 
leadership of submarine damage control efforts.'' 
  The designer's conclusion: 
  1. Protection of electric circuits between synchro 
transmitters and synchro receivers of the ``Korund'' system from 
short-circuit currents is not required, as is confirmed by 
experiments carried out by the developers of the ``Korund'' 
system. Such protection is absent from all submarines of the 
navy that have the ``Korund'' system, such that this is also not 
a peculiarity of the submarine ``Komsomolets''. 
  2. Analysis of the interrogation of the personnel of the 
``Komsomolets'' by the government commission shows that the 
``Korund'' caught fire not in the vicinity of the sunchro 
circuits but in the power supply units of the ``Korund'' located 
inside the stand of the ``Vektor'' subsystem. The power supply 
system circuit of the ``Korund'' is fully protected against 
shorts. In this connection the assertion of the authors of the 
remark that the designer failed to satisfy Article VII-7 of the 
TPPL-67 is inconsistent with reality. 
  3. The cause of the fire in the ``Korund'' console and its 
consequences were presented sufficiently objectively in the 
conclusion written by Vice Admiral V. V. Zaytsev, the naval 
deputy commander-in-chief and the chief of the Main Directorate 
for Operation and Repair, to the ``Analysis'' written by Vice 
Admiral Ye. D. Chernov: ``At 1122 the transformer block 
servicing the ``Korund'' system's rudder position indicators 
caught fire in the control room. Compartment 3 filled with gas, 
and so the attack center was compelled to carry out the 
subsequent submarine damage control actions while wearing 
individual protective equipment. Knowing the situation, and 
having made certain that rudder control failed, the control room 
was obligated to have given the command to deenergize the 
``Korund.'' This was not done, however.'' 
  In light of the above, the so-called ``consequences'' of the 
imagined peculiarities of the submarine ``Komsomolets'' have no 
real basis. 
  4. The requirements of the TPPL-75 and the OTT6.1.1-81 do 
not 
apply to the submarine ``Komsomolets'' for the reasons set forth 
in the conclusion regarding item 1 of the ``peculiarities.'' 
  As for the essence of Article 8.2.7 of the TPPL-75 and 
articles 1.3.3.1 and 1.3.3.6 of the OTT6.1.1-81, all that can be 
said is that the requirements of these articles have not been 
accepted by industry even for designing submarines of the 
future, because they are unrealistic (as regards mistakes by 
personnel) and the requirements on operating conditions 
(pressure) are unsubstantiated. 
  7. ``The design does not provide for complete 
deenergizing of electrical equipment in a distressed compartment 
by switching apparatus. For example in order to deenergize 
compartment 7, according to recommendations on using technical 
resources in emergency situations, 21.GGK-E-478-82, cables must 
be disconnected at GRShch 02 (compartment 5), and ShchTG 1 
(compartment 6) and at APPM-413V (compartment 4), which is 
practically impossible to do. 
  The consequences: 
  It is impossible in a major emergency situation to 
completely deenergize a submarine compartment, which is why the 
accident occurred and why a fire arose in compartment 4.'' 
  The designer's conclusion: 
  1. All power lines of the electric power system are 
deenergized by switching apparatus. The only things it doesn't 
deenergize are the control, blocking and monitoring circuits. 
These are the circuits to which the ``Recommendations'' refer. 
The electric power systems of all submarines of the navy are 
built on the basis of this principle, such that this is not a 
peculiarity of just the submarine ``Komsomolets''. Introduction 
of switching apparatus into control circuits unjustifiably 
complicates the circuits and reduces the reliability of a 
submarine's electric power system as a whole. 
  2. Complete deenergization of compartment 7 requires, 
besides 
disconnecting electrical equipment with switching apparatus, 
additional disconnection of: one cable in compartment 2 (two 
strands), two cables in compartment 4 (10 strands), two cables 
in compartment 5 (three strands), and three cables in 
compartment 6 (three strands). The labor consumed by this 
operation does not exceed 2-5 minutes, and it does not present 
any difficulties to trained personnel. The cables in the 
submarine ``Komsomolets'' were not disconnected not because it 
was a major emergency situation, as the authors of the remark 
assert, but only because the personnel did not know what had to 
be disconnected due to the absence of the RBITS, and because 
they never practiced this operation in ship damage control 
training. During the accident the personnel did not even make an 
attempt to disconnect the cables. 
  3. The assertion of the authors of the remark that 
development of the accident was a consequence of incomplete 
deenergization is unfounded, because this could in no way have 
affected the fire in compartments 6 and 7. This led only to a 
short flash in the TsNPK No. 1 pump starting station (and not to 
the fire in compartment 4, as the authors of the remark assert), 
after which the TsNPK pump continued to work in its prescribed 
mode. Even after the circuit breaker tripped in the distribution 
panel RShchN-12, located in compartment 7, the electric power 
system of the submarine remained serviceable, and continued to 
function until the end of the tragedy. 
  8. ``The kingstonless design of the TsGB sharply 
reduces the longitudinal stability of a submarine when it is not 
in trim and when the sea is disturbed. The requirement of 
Article 12.2.2 of the TPPL-75 was not satisfied: ``Ballast tanks 
of the middle group and, as a rule, part of the tanks of the 
fore and aft groups must have kingston valves, and mandatorily, 
second vent valve shut- offs.'' 
  The consequences: 
  This resulted in the flooding of TsGB No. 8, 9, 10 and 
disturbance of their integrity, as a result of which the 
submarine lost buoyancy and longitudinal stability.'' 
  The designer's conclusion: 
  1. Most submarines of the navy are made with the 
kingstonless 
design, and this is not a peculiarity of the submarine 
``Komsomolets''. 
  2. The TPPL-67, in accordance with which the submarine 
``Komsomolets'' was designed, does not contain a requirement of 
mandatory installation of kingston valves in main ballast tanks. 
For the reasons set forth in the conclusion regarding item 1, 
the requirements of the TPPL-75 do not apply to the submarine 
``Komsomolets''. In addition Article 12.2.2 of the TPPL-75 does 
not contain a mandatory requirement of installing kingston 
valves in the end groups of main ballast tanks, which can be 
seen upon inspection of the text of the article cited by the 
authors of the remark. The new OTT6.1.1-81, Article 1.5.6.11 
published by the navy contain no requirements on installing 
kingston valves in ballast tanks. Here as well, the complaints 
of the authors of the remark regarding absence of kingston 
valves from the main ballast tanks are groundless. 
  3. The line of reasoning of the authors of the remark 
suggesting that the kingstonless design of main ballast tanks 
sharply reduces the longitudinal stability of a submarine if it 
is not in trim and if the sea is disturbed is essentially 
incompetent. A submarine does not go out of trim on its own, but 
as a result of a loss of buoyancy reserve when the end 
compartments or ballast tanks fill up; in this case the 
submarine's longitudinal stability also decreases regardless of 
the design of the main ballast tanks and the sea state. 
Reduction of longitudinal stability manifests itself in 
kingstonless submarines to a somewhat greater degree than on 
submarines equipped with kingston valves; however, the 
possibility submarines have for blowing ballast tanks makes it 
possible to completely exclude the influence of the lack of 
kingston valves upon the elements of ship buoyancy and 
stability. In addition sea state begins to affect the buoyancy 
reserve of a submarine (and not its longitudinal stability, as 
the authors of the remark assert) at a sea state of 5-6 points 
or more. At the time of the accident of the submarine 
``Komsomolets'' the sea state was around 2-3 points, and its 
influence upon the ship's buoyancy reserve was negligible. 
  4. The ``consequences'' developed by the authors of the 
remark are inconsistent with the real circumstances. The 
submarine surfaced with its starboard main ballast tanks No. 5 
and 10 not blown. Under the particular circumstances of the 
accident, the port tank No. 10 would have lost its integrity and 
would have filled with water regardless of design. There are no 
grounds for asserting that tanks No. 8 and 9 lost their 
integrity and filled with water. The submarine sank as a result 
of flooding of compartment 7 and partially of compartment 6, 
with absolutely no damage control efforts attempted by the 
personnel. 
  9. ``The design of the VVD system does not permit 
blowing of the corresponding TsGB by what is left of the air 
reserve when one of the VVD cofferdams ruptures. Blowing the 
TsGB using the VZU system when on the surface is possible, but 
its effectiveness is extremely low, and it leads to a large loss 
of air reserve through blown tanks (see Act No. 6/8, 26 May 
1989, on the results of testing the effectiveness of blowing the 
aft group of TsGB using the VZU system). 
  The consequences: 
  This led to the impossibility of blowing the aft group 
of TsBG using cofferdam No. 2 during the accident. As a result 
of the system's low effectiveness and a large loss of air 
through the blown TsGB No. 7, possible blowing of the aft TsGB 
by the VZU would not have positive results in preserving 
longitudinal stability.'' 
  The designer's conclusion: 
  1. The high-pressure air system aboard the submarine 
``Komsomolets'' was built in accordance with OST V5.5017-79, and 
it is similar in its structure to the same systems of other 
submarines of the navy. The assertion of the authors of the 
remark that this system is unique to the ``Komsomolets'' is 
inconsistent with reality. 
  2. Nor is the assertion that it is impossible to blow the 
corresponding main ballast tanks when one of the cofferdams 
ruptures using the remaining high-pressure air reserve 
consistent with reality. When any one of the cofferdams fails, 
the high- pressure air system provides for surfacing of the 
submarine and subsequent blowing of previously unblown main 
ballast tanks through the blowing line using air from the 
outboard air main with the assistance of a diver. The assertion 
that the effectiveness of blowing the main ballast tanks using 
the outboard air system when surfaced is extremely low, and that 
it results in considerable loss of air reserve through the blown 
tanks, is based on technical ignorance, on an ignorance of the 
elementary laws of physics. Act No. 6/8, 26 May 1989, to which 
the authors of the remark refer, has not been furnished to 
workers of industry, and it is not known who took part in the 
tests. In this connection it is impossible to offer any kind of 
conclusion regarding this act. 
  Field trials conducted on 2-3 November 1989 aboard a certain 
submarine with the participation of representatives from the 
designer, from the Naval Institute No. 1, from the Naval Academy 
and from the Northern Fleet's 1st Submarine Flotilla confirm the 
high effectiveness of blowing the main ballast tanks using the 
outboard air system, and maintenance of high effectiveness of 
blowing any tank regardless of the physical state of neighboring 
tanks. 
  3. The ``consequences'' formulated by the authors of the 
remark are deliberately misleading: 
  the personnel of the ``Komsomolets'' made no attempts during 
the accident to blow the main ballast tanks with air from 
cofferdam No. 2 of the high-pressure air system through the 
outside air main because of their poor knowledge of the ship's 
material; 
  main ballast tanks can be blown with outboard air from high- 
pressure air cofferdam No. 2 by way of a special main connecting 
the No. 1 and 2 high-pressure air cofferdams. Because of the 
absence of the RBITS, the personnel had not practiced this 
variant of blowing the tanks; 
  if the aft group of main ballast tanks had been blown with 
outboard air when the port tank No. 7 was flooded, only an 
eighth of the expended air would have been used unproductively. 
To say that the system's effectiveness is low and that there 
would supposedly be a greater loss of air through the blown 
starboard tank is simply not serious. 
  10. ``The design does not foresee a system aboard the 
submarine for computerized documentation of events pertaining to 
calculation of stability and unsinkability, or an automated 
system producing recommendations to the leadership regarding 
damage control in major emergency situations. In addition to 
this, the submarine lacks instruments by which to monitor the 
submarine's static attitude in a disturbed sea (violation of the 
requirements of articles 9.2.5, 5.2.4 of the TPPL-75, and 
Articles 1.1.2.7, 5.2.2.8 of the OTT6.1.1-81). 
  The consequences: 
  1. An objective picture of the course of events in the 
accident situation could not be obtained. 
  2. The absence of a computer reduces the effectiveness 
of damage control and increases the time it takes to reach 
decisions in complex emergency situations. 
  3. The means of objectively monitoring change in the 
submarine's attitude are lacking, making it impossible for the 
GKP to correctly predict the submarine's behavior when water 
enters a compartment and the TsGB.'' 
The designer's conclusion: 
  1. Automated systems for solving unsinkability problems and 
for issuing damage control recommendations are absent from all 
submarines and surface ships of the navy. Instruments monitoring 
static attitude are absent as well. Moreover we have still not 
developed the concepts of creating these systems, and we have 
not conducted exploratory research on the design of such 
instruments. The navy has not issued the specifications for 
their design. All of the discussion concerning absence of these 
automated systems and instruments aboard the submarine 
``Komsomolets'' are directed at consciously and deliberately 
misleading public opinion. 
  2. The requirements of the TPPL-75 and OTT6.1.1-81 do not 
apply to the submarine ``Komsomolets'' for the reasons set forth 
in the conclusion regarding item 1 of the ``peculiarities,'' and 
any reference to them is wrong. As far as the essence of the 
issue is concerned, Article 5.2.4 of the TPPL-75 and Article 
5.2.2.8 OTT6.1.1-81, which present the requirements on designing 
the systems and instruments, have not been accepted by industry 
even for the design of submarines in the future. Article 9.2.5 
of the TPPL-75 and Article 1.1.2.7 of the OTT6.1.1-81 have no 
relationship to the issue under discussion here. 
  3. As for the ``consequences,'' the following needs to be 
said: 
  The attack center of the ``Komsomolets'' did nothing to 
study 
the objective information on the course of events in the 
accident situation. It did not monitor change in the ship's 
attitude, nor did it carry out any kind of calculations on 
change in its buoyancy and stability. All of this could have 
been done without a computer or special instruments. As a result 
of the attack center's inaction the loss of stability was a 
surprise to it. Given such an attitude toward the work, no 
computers could have helped. 
  The authors of the remark are concerned not with clarifying 
the true causes of the tragedy but only with finding plausible 
``evidence'' in order to conceal and justify the poor 
occupational training of the crew of the submarine 
``Komsomolets'', which is the sole cause of the tragedy. 
  11. ``The design does not foresee a system for 
monitoring the filling (blowing) of the submarine's TsGB. 
  The consequences: 
  This made it impossible to establish the causes of 
listing, or to monitor filling of TsGB Nos. 8, 9 and 10 when 
their airtightness was disturbed.'' 
  The designer's conclusion: 
  1. The TPPL and OTT contain no requirements on installing 
systems aboard submarines for monitoring the filling of the main 
ballast tanks. The remark of the authors that such a system is a 
necessity is groundless. Not a single submarine of the navy has 
a system for monitoring the filling of main ballast tanks. Such 
that its absence from the ``Komsomolets'' is not a peculiarity 
of this submarine. Certain classes of submarines have systems 
that indicate completion of blowing of main ballast tanks. 
However, tank batch-blowing systems were introduced in 
submarines of more recent classes, and the need for installing 
systems indicating completion of blowing disappeared. 
  2. About the ``consequences'': The attack center could have 
clarified the causes of listing during repeat blowing of the end 
main ballast tanks, which was done at 1134, by visually 
observing the tanks from the bridge. This was not done. The 
cause of listing could have been clarified and filling of the 
ballast tanks could have been subsequently monitored by 
periodically introducing batches of air into them through diver 
tank blowing lines. This was not done either. In light of the 
above, it is clear that the ``consequences'' are totally 
fabricated, and that they do not reflect the facts of the matter. 
  12. ``Use of RAVA rubberized metal hoses, which have 
low resistance to temperature effects (around 150C), in the 
outboard water system. Absence of a device in the outboard 
system preventing entry of water into a compartment as a result 
of rupture of RAVA hoses (the requirements of Article VII-7 of 
the TPPL-67, Article 8.2.7 of the TPPL-75, and articles 1.3.3.1, 
1.3.3.6 of the OTT6.1.1-81 were violated). In addition there is 
nothing in the technical documents indicating to the personnel 
that RAVA hoses have low resistance to temperature effects. 
  The consequences: 
  RAVA hoses ruptured in response to fire and the 
elevated temperature in the compartment, which led to 
uncontrolled flooding of the compartment and loss of the 
submarine's longitudinal stability and buoyancy.'' 
  The designer's conclusion: 
  1. There are no requirements of any kind in the TPPL and OTT 
on heat resistance of articles used aboard submarines. RAVA 
reinforced hoses are guaranteed to remain serviceable at a 
temperature of 150C for 30 minutes and at full working 
pressure, which are rather high characteristics for rubber 
articles. 
  2. The assertion that there are no devices in the outboard 
water system preventing entry of water into a compartment as a 
result of rupture of RAVA hoses is inconsistent with reality. 
There is a remotely controlled kingston valve at the intake of 
the cooling line of the stern-tube gland, and a check valve in 
the drain line, which cut off a damaged RAVA hose. 
  3. RAVA hoses are used aboard all submarines built in recent 
years, and their use aboard the ``Komsomolets'' is not unique to 
this submarine. 
  4. The assertion that the requirements of Article VII-7 of 
the TPPL-67 were violated is inconsistent with reality. The 
requirements of the TPPL-75 and the OTT6.1.1-81 do not apply to 
the submarine ``Komsomolets'' for the reasons set forth in the 
conclusion regarding item 1 of the ``peculiarities.'' As for the 
essence of the issue, Article 8.2.7 of the TPPL-75 and articles 
1.3.3.1, 1.3.3.6 of the OTT6.1.1-81 have not even been accepted 
for submarines of the future, because they are unrealistic (as 
regards mistakes of the personnel) and because of the 
requirements on operating conditions (pressure) are 
unsubstantiated. 
  5. The heat resistance characteristics of RAVA hoses are 
presented in documents given to the personnel based on 
K-909-045-ED1 (items 1049 and 1333). 
  6. As for the ``consequences'': 
  The operator at the main propulsion unit console did not 
fulfill requirements of articles 90 and 91 of the RBZh-PL-82 
with regard to sealing off the distressed compartment, and he 
did not close the remotely controlled kingston valve of the 
stern-tube gland's cooling system, which does not affect the 
submarine's propulsion; this resulted in entry of water into 
compartment 7 following rupture of the RAVA hose in response to 
the fire. The heat resistance of the RAVA hose has no relevance 
to this. 
  Because of the absence of the RBITS, this measure was not 
practiced by the ship's personnel in firefighting exercises; the 
``consequences'' dreamed up by the authors are inconsistent with 
the actual circumstances of the accident. 
  13. ``Low reliability of the electric power system and 
its components, especially of series AM and AM-M circuit 
breakers, the gap of which between the main contact securing 
pins is not checked during manufacture. 
  The submarine lacks a program supporting the 
reliability of technical resources (the requirements of Article 
2.3 of the OTT6.1.1-81 and Article 6.2.5 of the TPPL-75 were 
violated). 
  The consequences: 
  The low reliability of circuit breakers has resulted in 
emergencies aboard submarines on several occasions. Sixteen 
fires occurred aboard second-generation submarines in the period 
from 1971 to 1985 due to shorts in automatic AM and AM-M circuit 
breakers. Because of the absence of such a program, it is 
impossible to organize maintenance of high reliability of 
technical resources during operation.'' 
  The designer's conclusion: 
  1. The assertion that the reliability of electric power 
equipment in systems in the submarine ``Komsomolets'' is low is 
not justified by anything, and is inconsistent with reality. Not 
a single failure of the electric power system as a whole or of 
its components was ever documented in over 5 years of operation. 
According to the Elektrosila Association the gap between the 
pins securing the main poles of series AM and AM-M circuit 
breakers is checked for its correspondence with shop drawings. 
The results are entered on the data card of each circuit breaker. 
  2. The requirements of the TPPL-75 and OTT6.1.1-81 do not 
apply to the submarine ``Komsomolets'' for the reasons set forth 
in the conclusion regarding item 1 of the ``peculiarities.'' 
  As for the essence of the issue: 
  The requirements regarding reliability of particular systems 
and of the submarine as a whole were satisfied by the designer 
by issuing specifications on new equipment with high reliability 
indicators, and with the large volume of experimental design 
work carried out by the equipment manufacturer, including 
manufacture of experimental models of this equipment. The 
requirements of the OST and GOST on designing these systems and 
devices were fulfilled by the designer during the planning of 
these systems and devices. All of this made it possible to 
guarantee high comprehensive reliability indicators in the 
specifications on the submarine ``Komsomolets''; the high 
comprehensive indicators of the reliability of the systems, 
equipment and the ship as a whole were confirmed by bench tests 
on experimental models of new equipment, which included testing 
for failure-free operation of this equipment throughout the 
entire time of continuous operation established by the 
specifications, and experimental operation of the submarine on 
the basis of a special program, to include a fully independent 
cruise. A log was developed and a spare set of equipment not 
used aboard other classes of submarines was delivered in order 
to keep the submarine's reliability high. The high reliability 
of equipment designed on the basis of the designer's 
specifications and of the submarine as a whole manifested itself 
during the accident, in the course of which all equipment and 
systems operated without failure until the last moment, and all 
safety and blocking systems foreseen by the design worked, which 
ensured automatic accident-free shut- down of equipment of the 
main propulsion unit, including the reactor and the main 
turbogear unit. 
  The designer drew up the following basic documents on the 
reliability of the submarine ``Komsomolets'': 
  design reliability justification K-020-556; 
  specific features of base support K-020-073; 
  equipment reliability indicators K-030-640; 
  technical crew calculations and justification K-030-631; 
  recommendations for developing the RBITS 21.GGK-E-478-82; 
  in accordance with the standard program for supporting 
submarine reliability No. 004-65-013, the navy should have 
developed a specific program, with the designer's participation, 
to support reliability during operation of the ``Komsomolets''. 
The program was not developed, and responsibility for this is 
borne by the navy's Main Directorate for Operation and 
Repair--the author of this remark, who scores no points for 
trying to dump the responsibility upon the designer. 
  3. About the ``consequences'': 
  Leaving aside the thoughts of the authors of the remark 
regarding electrical equipment of second-generation submarines 
as being irrelevant to the accident aboard the submarine 
``Komsomolets'', we need to say that in 5 years of operation of 
the ``Komsomolets'', no negative remarks were ever made 
regarding the work of series AM and AM-M circuit breakers. 
During the accident these circuit breakers provided for 
automatic disconnection of damaged networks, distribution panels 
and damaged electrical equipment, and ensured trouble-free 
operation of the electric power system until the submarine's 
demise. 
  The navy's Main Directorate for Operation and Repair failed 
to carry out the following basic measures to support high 
reliability of technical resources during operation of the 
submarine ``Komsomolets'': 
  A reliability support program was not created; 
  a set of repair documents for planned preventive inspections 
and repairs to be carried out between cruises was not developed; 
  basing of the submarine in accordance with requirements of 
document K-020-073 was not provided for; 
  a technical crew was not organized for the submarine; 
  the operating cycle governing use of the submarine foreseen 
by the specifications was not maintained, as a result of which 
the ship set off on its cruise with part of the life of the 
equipment and systems expended (automatic systems, outboard 
fittings, gas analyzers). 
  In light of the above, the thoughts of the authors of the 
remark regarding the absence of any kind of ``program,'' which 
made it impossible to maintain ``high reliability of technical 
resources'' aboard the submarine ``Komsomolets'', are devoid of 
any grounds. 
  14. ``Flammable materials that are not heat resistant 
were used to trim compartment 7 (glue, thermal insulation etc.), 
Article V-4 of the TPPL-67, Article 3.5.10 of the TPPL-75, and 
Article 5.2.3.8 of the OTT6.1.1-81 were violated. 
  The consequences: 
  This resulted in swift development of the fire and an 
increase in the temperature in the compartment to 
800C.'' 
  The designer's conclusion: 
  1. Materials corresponding to OST V5.9025-80 and the 
``Statute on Selection of Nonmetallic Structural Materials for 
Submarines'' No. 74-0450-06-78 were used to trim compartments of 
the submarine ``Komsomolets'', including compartment 7. They are 
all permitted for use in submarines. There are simply no other 
alternative materials that had been permitted for use in 
submarines. They are used to trim the compartments of all 
submarines of the navy, such that this is not a peculiarity of 
the ``Komsomolets''. 
  2. The assertion that Article V-4 of the TPPL-67 was 
violated 
is inconsistent with reality. As for the TPPL-75 and 
OTT6.1.1-81, these requirements do not apply to the submarine 
``Komsomolets'' for the reasons set forth in the conclusion 
regarding item 1 of the ``peculiarities.'' As for the essence of 
the issue: Article 5.2.3.8 of the OTT6.1.1-81, which were 
published to replace the TPPL-75, states: ``Structural, heat and 
sound insulating and finishing materials...must be only 
nonflammable or fire-retardant.'' This requirement was satisfied 
to a realistic extent aboard the submarine ``Komsomolets''. 
  3. The assertion that the materials used to trim compartment 
7 resulted in ``swift development of the fire and an increase in 
the temperature in the compartment to 800C'' is absurd. 
According to calculations, when there is a fire in the 
compartment, when the initial oxygen concentration in the 
atmosphere is nominal, and when air does not enter from without, 
the average compartment-wide temperature would be around 
200C. Intensive development of the fire (and not swift, as 
the authors of the remark assert) was the consequence of the 
high oxygen concentration in the compartment atmosphere due to 
its uncontrolled entry. Further entry of air into compartment 6 
out of the high-pressure air system due to incorrect actions 
taken by the submarine's command led to development of the fire 
and the increase in temperature in the compartment to 
800-900C (according to calculations) at a compartment 
pressure of 13 kg/cm[.sup]2[/]. 
  15. ``The SDS system is not equipped with the necessary 
protection from entry of contaminated air from a damaged 
compartment under high pressure into the ShDA system when the 
airtightness of VSD and SDS pipelines is disturbed (Article 
8.2.7 of the TPPL-75, Article VII-7 of the TPPL-67, and Article 
1.3.3.6 of the OTT6.1.1l-81 were violated). 
  The consequences: 
  This led to poisoning of personnel in compartments 5 
and 2 connected up to ShDA.'' 
  The designer's conclusion: 
  1. The stationary breathing system (SDS) of the submarine 
``Komsomolets'' was developed in full correspondence with 
guidelines RD V5.5536-82, coordinated with the navy. Such 
systems were developed for all submarines according to the same 
principle, and it is not a peculiarity of the submarine 
``Komsomolets''. 
  2. The SDS system excludes the possibility of entry of 
contaminated air from a damaged compartment at high pressure 
into hose-type breathing apparatus even when the integrity of 
medium- pressure air and SDS lines is disturbed, because the SDS 
system is self-contained in each compartment, and the pressure 
in the medium- pressure air system is considerably higher than 
it could be in a damaged compartment. 
  3. The requirements of Article VII-7 of the TPPL-67 are 
satisfied in their full volume in the submarine ``Komsomolets''. 
The requirements of the TPPL-75 and OTT6.1.1-81 do not apply to 
the submarine ``Komsomolets'' for the reasons set forth in the 
conclusion regarding item 1 of the ``peculiarities.'' The 
essence of the issue: Article 8.2.7 of the TPPL-75 and Article 
1.3.3.6 of the OTT6.1.1-81 have not been accepted by industry 
even for designing submarines of the future, because they are 
unrealistic (as regards mistakes by personnel). 
  As for the ``consequences'': 
1. personnel of compartment 2 were poisoned as a result of the 
incorrect actions of the commander of this compartment, who 
connected the SDS to the medium-pressure air system according to 
the back-up procedure, and then the submarine's command, which 
disconnected the high- and medium-pressure mains without warning 
the personnel of compartment 2 of this; 
2. personnel in compartment 5 were poisoned because the 
commander of this compartment failed to monitor operation of the 
SDS system, which was receiving air from the damaged cofferdam 
No. 1 of the high-pressure air main, and the incorrect actions 
of the attack center, on the instructions of which air was cut 
off to the medium- pressure air system without the personnel of 
the compartments being notified. 
  Consequently the assertion of the authors of the remark that 
the absence of any kind of ``necessary protection'' resulted in 
the poisoning of the personnel is inconsistent with reality. It 
should be noted that among the measures to raise the reliability 
of personnel life support resources in emergency situations 
developed as a result of the accident, there are no measures for 
improving the SDS system. 
  16. ``The number of personnel calculated by the central 
design office serving as the designer was insufficient to 
service equipment in normal conditions, and absolutely not 
enough to carry out submarine damage control in times of 
accident. 
  The consequences: 
  Damage control was made difficult, and it was 
impossible to fulfill all of the requirements of the guidelines 
regarding damage control.'' 
  The designer's conclusion: 
  1. According to the detail design the crew of the submarine 
``Komsomolets'' should have consisted of 41 persons, in which 
case the number of personnel in BCh-5 should have been 19 
officers and warrant officers. Without the consent of industry 
the navy increased the crew to 57 persons by its Directive No. 
730/2/00395 dated 23 April 1982; in this case the number of 
personnel in BCh-5 was increased by only one person. Apparently 
the navy felt that this number was fully sufficient for this 
department, which maintains technical resources and carries out 
submarine damage control. This same directive introduced the 
position of watch mechanical engineer, which was not justified 
by anything and which reduced the number of BCh-5 personnel 
serving watch in the compartments. Later on, four of 10 warrant 
officers of BCh-5 were replaced on the basis of naval directives 
by compulsory-service seamen, which significantly reduced the 
potentials of the BCh-5 in technical maintenance of the materiel 
and in ship damage control. Further addition of one officer and 
two seamen to BCh-5 could not compensate for the weakening 
suffered by this subdivision earlier. 
  It follows from this that the potential of BCh-5 was reduced 
and the number of personnel became ``insufficient'' not because 
the designer incorrectly calculated the size of the crew, but 
because the navy unjustifiably replaced warrant officers by 
compulsory- service seamen and increased the overall number of 
personnel without grounds. 
  Moreover the assertion of the authors of the remark 
regarding 
an insufficient number of personnel is not reinforced by any 
kind of calculations. Were the qualifications of the specialists 
adequate, the increase that was made in the crew size to 64 
persons would have been quite enough to maintain the submarine 
under normal operating conditions. Analysis of the personnel's 
actions during the accident showed that most of the crew did not 
participate in ship damage control, and that the main load of 
this fight was carried by only a few persons. 
  2. The submarine ``Komsomolets'' set off on its cruise 
without the full complement of personnel in the damage control 
division of BCh- 5 (Warrant Officer Yu. P. Podgornov had not 
been certified for independent control), which weakened the 
principal division of BCh- 5, responsible for damage control, 
even more. The requirement of Article 173 of the RBZh-PL-82, 
which prohibits a submarine from going to sea undermanned, was 
violated. 
  3. About the ``consequences'': 
  Analysis of damage control efforts aboard the submarine 
``Komsomolets'' shows that: 
1. The submarine's leadership used the commander of the damage 
control division for duties inconsistent with the prescriptions 
of Article 45, RBZh-PL-82, as a result of which neither the 
buoyancy and stability of the ship, nor expenditure of 
high-pressure air, nor pressure in the compartments was 
monitored, and competent actions were not taken in submarine 
damage control; 
2. Captain 1st Rank Ye. A. Vanin's crew did not have 
sufficient knowledge of the material of the submarine, and its 
combat training level was very low in regard to ship damage 
control; 
3. during the accident the submarine's attack center displayed 
passiveness in ship damage control efforts, and certain 
decisions that it did make were incompetent as a rule; 
  4. the attempt by the authors of the remark to transfer the 
blame for the outcome of the accident onto the designer is 
directed at concealing the low occupational and combat readiness 
of Captain 1st Rank Vanin's crew. 
  17. ``Low reliability of the ``Listvennitsa'' ship GGS 
and battery-free telephone communication. Breakdown 
(short-circuiting) of the corresponding cables in one of the 
compartments resulted in loss of internal ship communication 
(the requirements of Article 5.3.5 of the TPPL-75, Article 
5.2.4.2 of the OTT6.1.1-81 were violated). 
  The consequences: 
  Absence of communication made efficient leadership of 
submarine damage control practically impossible.'' 
  The designer's conclusion: 
  1. The ``Listvennitsa'' loudspeaker communication system 
(GGS) is installed aboard all submarines of the navy, in 
connection with which this is not a peculiarity of only the 
submarine ``Komsomolets''. 
  2. ``Listvennitsa'' loudspeaker communication is installed 
as 
a requirement of the navy's Main Communications Directorate in 
spite of the opinion of the designer, who pointed out its 
shortcomings in comparison with the previously used ``Kashtan'' 
loudspeaker communication system. Without going into the 
technical side of the matter, I should say that the entire 
responsibility for the low reliability of the ``Listvennitsa'' 
loudspeaker communication system lies with the navy's Main 
Communications Directorate, which issued the specifications, 
financed and monitored the development of the loudspeaker 
system, and accepted it for the navy. 
  3. The assertion of the authors of the remark that breakdown 
(short-circuiting) of the corresponding cables in one of the 
compartments led to loss of communication via the battery-free 
telephone system is inconsistent with reality. There are full 
grounds for suggesting that telephone communication between 
compartment 5 and the attack center was lost due to incompetent 
use of this system (the distressed compartments were not 
disconnected at the switchboards). 
  4. The assertion of the authors of the remark that loss of 
communication made efficient leadership of submarine damage 
control practically impossible is inconsistent with reality, 
because all of the necessary and fundamental decisions and 
actions relating to ship damage control should have been carried 
out by personnel of compartment 3--that is, the compartment 
containing the attack center. This assertion by the authors of 
the remark is only an excuse for the inactivity of the 
submarine's command in damage control efforts. 
  18. ``The design does not foresee a system for 
relieving pressure from the distressed compartment in major 
accident situations (the requirements of Article 12.2.9 of the 
TPPL-75 were not fulfilled). 
  The consequences: 
  This led to fire in compartments 6 and 5 and gas 
contamination of compartments 2 and 3.'' 
  The designer's conclusion: 
  1. Naval guidelines on designing submarines do not contain 
requirements on developing a special system for relieving 
pressure from a distressed compartment. Not a single submarine 
of the navy has such a system, and therefore its absence from 
the ``Komsomolets'' is not unique to the ship. 
  2. Article 12.2.9 of the TPPL-75 discusses relief of 
pressure 
by compressors in normal submarine operating conditions, which 
has nothing in common with the remarks here, and therefore the 
reference to it is incorrect. 
  3. In accordance with Article 275 of the RBZh-PL-82, the 
responsibility of developing recommendations on relieving 
pressure in each compartment of a surfaced and a submerged 
submarine of each class is assigned to the naval formations. 
These recommendations were obviously not drawn up, and they were 
not studied by the personnel of the ``Komsomolets'' during 
submarine damage control exercises. The absence of the RBITS 
from the ship also played a negative role. 
  4. The assertion of the authors of the remarks that the 
absence of a system for relieving pressure from distressed 
compartments led to the fires in compartments 6 and 5 and gas 
contamination of compartments 2 and 3 is inconsistent with 
reality. The fire and gas contamination of the compartments were 
caused by the failure of the submarine's command to fulfill the 
requirements of articles 89 and 121, and the failure of the 
personnel to fulfill articles 90 and 91 of the RBZh-PL-82 
regarding sealing off compartments, disconnecting high-pressure 
air and hydraulic system pipelines passing through the 
distressed compartment, and bleeding air reserves overboard from 
the damaged cofferdam No. 4 of the high- pressure air system. 
The absence of the RBITS and failure of the naval formation to 
fulfill the requirements of Article 275 of the RBZh-PL-82 
concerning development of recommendations on relieving pressure 
from compartments also played a negative role. 
  19. ``The VVD, VZU and VSD systems do not correspond in 
full volume to the requirements on maintaining viability of 
technical resources (Article 5.3.5 of the TPPL-75, articles 
5.2.4.2, 1.3.3.1 of the OTT6.1.1-81). 
  The consequences: 
  Loss of airtightness of the air systems led to swift 
development of a compartment-wide fire and a rise in pressure in 
compartments 7 and 6 and of temperature to 800C.'' 
  The designer's conclusion: 
  1. The assertion of the authors of the remark that the high- 
and medium-pressure air and outboard air systems do not 
correspond ``in full volume'' to the requirements of maintaining 
the viability of technical resources is groundless and 
unspecific. These systems were built in full correspondence with 
OST V5.5057-79, and they satisfy all requirements of the navy. 
The air systems of the submarine ``Komsomolets'' do not differ 
from the systems of other third-generation submarines, and they 
are in no way ``unique.'' 
  2. The requirements of the TPPL-75 and the OTT6.1.1-81 do 
not 
apply to the submarine ``Komsomolets'' for the reasons set forth 
in paragraph 1 of the ``peculiarities.'' The essence of the 
issue: The requirements of Article 5.3.5 of the TPPL-75 and 
Article 5.2.4.2 of the OTT6.1.1-81 concerning system back-up 
were fully realized in the ``Komsomolets'', while the 
requirements of Article 1.3.3.1 of the OTT6.1.1-81 were not 
accepted by industry even to design submarines of the future 
because they are unrealistic (as regards mistakes by personnel). 
  3. The assertion of the authors of the remark that swift 
development of a compartment-wide fire occurred because the 
high- pressure and medium-pressure air and outboard air systems 
somehow ``do not correspond'' to requirements of the navy does 
not reflect the actual events: 
A. in the initial stage of the accident there was neither a 
swiftly developing nor a compartment-wide fire; 
B. an intense local fire was a consequence of the elevated 
oxygen concentration in compartment 7 due to uncontrolled 
delivery of oxygen into this compartment. Failure of the control 
room to fulfill the requirements of articles 89 and 121 of the 
RBZh-PL-82, and the incorrect decision to blow the aft group of 
main ballast tanks with air from the damaged cofferdam, caused 
rupture of the emergency blowing pipe and bleeding of air from 
it into compartment 7, and then caused loss of airtightness of 
high- and medium- pressure air and outboard air system pipelines 
and bleeding of air out of high-pressure air cofferdams No. 1, 3 
and 4, transforming a local fire into a compartment-wide one. 
The above assertions of the authors of the remark are aimed at 
covering up the incorrect actions of the attack center of the 
submarine ``Komsomolets''. 
  20. ``Valves of the emergency compartment pumping 
system are not equipped with manual control from adjacent 
compartments (the requirements of Article 12.2.21 of the TPPL-75 
were violated). 
  The consequences: 
  This made it impossible to use the pumping system to 
relieve pressure from the distressed compartments.'' 
  The designer's conclusion: 
  1. The emergency pumping system aboard the submarine 
``Komsomolets'' was built in accordance with the OST, and it did 
not differ in any way from similar systems aboard other 
submarines. The assertion of the authors of the remark that the 
design of the emergency pumping system is a ``peculiarity'' of 
the ``Komsomolets'' is inconsistent with reality. 
  2. The requirements of the TPPL-75 do not apply to the 
submarine ``Komsomolets'' for the reasons set forth in the 
conclusion regarding item 1 of the ``peculiarities.'' The 
essence of the issue: In accordance with requirements of Article 
12.2.21 of the TPPL-75, the compartment pumping valves must be 
equipped with manual control from adjacent compartments. Aboard 
the ``Komsomolets'', these valves had manual and hydraulic 
drives. The electro-hydromanipulator that controls the opening 
and closing of the compartment pumping valve is located in the 
adjacent compartment, and it provides for manual control out of 
the adjacent compartment, as is required by Article 12.2.21 of 
the TPPL-75. Thus the assertion of the authors of the remark 
that the designer did not fulfill this requirement is 
inconsistent with reality. 
  3. The ``consequences'' have the goal of covering up the 
inaction of the attack center of the submarine ``Komsomolets'' 
in containing the accident and fighting for the ship's survival. 
The decision to relieve pressure was made by the submarine's 
command at 1150--that is, at a time when the hydraulic system 
was disconnected and control over ship systems in the distressed 
compartments was lost, and pressure in the compartments attained 
13 kg/cm[.sup]2[/]. Under these conditions the pumping valve 
could be opened only by hand inside the distressed compartment, 
which was unrealistic. It should be noted that the RBZh-PL-82 
say nothing about preliminary opening of this valve in case of 
fire. Considering that this valve is designed as a check and 
stop valve, it would have been reasonable to include a statement 
to this effect. The absence of the RBITS and failure of the 
naval formation to fulfill requirements of Article 275 of the 
RBZh-PL-82 regarding development of recommendations on relieving 
pressure from distressed compartments played a negative role. 
<H5>  Postscript </H5>
  While this book was at the typesetters we became acquainted 
with B. A. Karzhavin's books ``Tayna gibeli linkora 
``Novorossiysk'' ''[The Mystery of the Sinking of the Battleship 
``Novorossiysk''] and ``Gibel lineynogo korablya 
``Novorossiysk'' '' [The Sinking of the Battleship 
``Novorossiysk'']. They returned me once again to the question 
of the roots of the tragedy of the submarine ``Komsomolets''. 
  In 1949, when the Italian navy was divided up, our country 
received the battleship ``Novorossiysk'' (formerly the ``Julius 
Caesar''). Surface unsinkability was practically lacking on this 
ship, and its stability did not correspond to norms of the USSR 
Navy. 
  In the 6 years that the battleship was on line, the naval 
leadership did nothing to correct these deficiencies. Documents 
on unsinkability and ship damage control were not even drawn up, 
and those that were available, were written in Italian. It was 
dangerous for the battleship to go to sea--it could sink as a 
result of any navigation accident in which water enters the ship. 
  On 29 October 1955 the battleship ``Novorossiysk'' sank as a 
result of an outside explosion while standing at the main base 
of the Black Sea Fleet. Over 600 men perished. 
  The government commission that investigated the 
circumstances 
of the sinking of the battleship turned out to be incapable of 
making the proper assessment of the inactivity of the navy's 
central structures--the main culprits of the tragedy. The proper 
conclusions were not made, and consequently shortcomings were 
not corrected in personnel work, in personnel combat training, 
in repair and technical maintenance of ships, in the work of the 
emergency rescue service, and in providing ships with damage 
control guidelines. 
  The tragedy of the submarine ``Komsomolets'' occurred 33 
years later, and once again for the same reasons. 
  Ships are sinking, people are dying, and the navy's central 
structures continue to pretend they have nothing to do with this.

confirming the readiness of a submarine crew for independent 
navigation and patrol duty. This is preceded by a theoretical 
course attended by the crew in the training center, its training 
under a program of shore training between cruises, and study of 
submarine material, instructions in manuals on operation of 
combat and technical resources of the ship and the organization 
of ship service, together with test cruises at sea and the

  16. LOKh--a chemical room fire extinguishing system aboard 
submarines. Freon is used as the fire extinguisher. Each 
compartment of a submarine contains a station of the LOKh 
system, from which fire extinguisher can be delivered into that 
or neighboring compartments. The system is used to put out large 
fires at any stage of their development. The command ``Deliver 
LOKh to compartment 7'' means deliver fire extinguisher to

  18. Line of defense--in an emergency, the attack center 
designates a line of defense--that is, it indicates the 
transverse bulkheads of the compartments that separate the zone 
of distress from the rest of the ship. At these lines of 
defense, the personnel seal off the bulkheads and plug the main 
pipelines passing into the damaged compartment. Constant 
monitoring of the airtightness of bulkheads and pipelines, the 
temperature of the bulkhead and pressure in the distressed 
compartment is established at lines of defense. 
  19. A quickly dismountable rack-and-pinion device is used to

after which the door could be opened. 
  20. VPL--air-foam fire extinguishing system. In this case 
the 
reference is to the liquid that forms after the foam settles. 
For greater detail about the system, see footnote 33. 
  21. IDA-59--self-contained breathing apparatus. To connect 
an 
unconscious person up to an IDA-59 means securing the mask over

  30. ShDA--hose-type breathing apparatus. It is intended for 
breathing by personnel in a smoky compartment atmosphere. Air 
for breathing is supplied from the ship's high- and 
medium-pressure air lines through a stationary breathing system. 
It permits limited movement of personnel connected to ShDA 
apparatus. ``Connect up to the ShDA'' means donning the face 
mask or starting to breathe air from the stationary breathing 
system. 
  31. SDS--ship stationary breathing system. Provides air for 
breathing to hose-type breathing apparatus (see above). Charging 
the SDS system means supplying air to it from the high- or 
medium- pressure air lines. 
  32. IP--the IP-6 self-contained breathing protective mask. 
Possesses an independent breathing support system. Used to 
protect respiratory organs from poisoned air at normal 
atmospheric pressure. ``To be connected up to an IP'' means 
wearing the IP-6 self-contained breathing protective mask. 
  33. VPL system--air-foam fire extinguishing system. Used 
aboard submarines to extinguish small local fires. A typical 
system consists of two air-foam emulsion preparing stations 
located in the end compartments, a line passing through all 
compartments, and hoses bearing dispensers (sprayers ) located 
in all compartments. The air-foam emulsion is delivered by air 
at a pressure of 15 kg/cm[.sup]2[/]. One of the system's 
stations is permanently connected to the line--that is, the VPL 
system is always ready for immediate use. When a damage control 
alarm is announced, the status of the stations of the VPL system 
is kept under constant observation. When the air-foam emulsion 
of the station connected to the line is used up, it is 
recharged. At this time the other of the system's stations 
standing in reserve is connected to the line. Stations are 
recharged and connected to the line during a damage control 
alarm without orders from the attack center. 
  34. TsVK--here, the digital computer system room. The TsVK 
room aboard the submarine ``Komsomolets'' is located in 
compartment 3, next to the control room. 
  35. When sending a radio message, a submarine must receive a 
message (an acknowledgement) from the addressee indicating that 
it had been received and correctly understood (decoded). The 
entry ``no acknowledgement'' means that messages confirming 
receipt of the distress signals by the addressee had not arrived. 
  36. SIZ--individual protective equipment, collective name of 
equipment used to protect the breathing organs of an individual 
from environmental effects. Regarding ShDA, see footnote 30. 
  37. IDA--IDA-59 self-contained breathing apparatus. Has a 
self- contained breathing support system. Used for underwater 
work and for work in compartments with high pressure and a 
poisoned atmosphere. 
  38. VSK--rescue chamber. Aboard the submarine 
``Komsomolets'' 
it was intended for the rescue of all personnel from a depth 
exceeding the submarine's maximum diving depth. It was equipped 
with limited life support resources, and it had its own electric 
lighting. 
  39. PDU--portable breathing device. Intended for short-term 
(around 10 minutes) protection of the personnel's respiratory 
organs in a smoke-filled compartment. Small in size. Each 
crewmember is obligated to always have a PDU with him when 
aboard a submarine. 
  40. SPS documents--secret business documents. 
  41. PGA-VPM--portable instrument for measuring the 
concentration of carbon monoxide in the atmosphere of 
compartments. Measurements are taken with indicator tubes for 
different concentrations of carbon monoxide through which 
compartment air is pumped. 
  42. RDO--radio message. All radio messages from a submarine 
are numbered. 
  43. RSP-30 mm--signal cartridges launched with a flare gun. 
  44. Regenerating cartridges--chemical substances used aboard 
submarines to regenerate air (restore its percent concentration 
of oxygen and carbon dioxide) in compartments. Made in the form 
of flat wafers contained in metallic soldered rectangular cans. 
The submarine ``Komsomolets'' had only an emergency reserve of 
regenerating cartridges.

  [Abstract] The control of trace quantities of organic 
substances of industrial origin, such as petroleum and petroleum 
products, in natural, potable, and waste waters is becoming more 
and more significant from the environmental standpoint. 
Luminescent methods are normally used to detect contamination 
from petroleum products. The visible fluorescence of petroleum 
and petroleum products results from the presence of aromatic and 
heterocyclic compounds absorbed in the ultraviolet region of the 
spectrum. However, it bears noting that modern 
spectrofluorometric methods for detecting traces of petroleum 
products in water are encumbered with lengthy sample preparation 
(extraction, sorption) in order to separate the polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAU). In natural waters, PAU fluorescence 
is recorded against a background of dissolved organic substances 
(ROV) and a spontaneous Raman spectrum of excited illumination 
on the water molecules, thus making it impossible to determine 
trace quantities of PAU directly without their preliminary 
separation. Synchronous spectrofluorometric methods are an 
exception, although they require costly equipment and specially 
trained personnel. Thus the problem of an express method for 
detecting and assaying the degree of contamination remains in 
essence the as the isolation of a fluorescence signal of PAU 
against a background of ROV illumination. In the present work an 
express laser-luminescent technique was developed which makes it 
possible to conduct spectral fractionation of PAU contamination 
without supplemental treatment of the water sample. The use of 
periodic pulsed excitation in conjunction with signal gathering 
enables determination of PAU within the range 5 X 
10[.sup]-10[/] - 1 X 10[.sup]-7[/] g/ml. Figures 5;

  [Abstract] Plasticized electrodes having a membrane 
containing a neutral carrier (crown-ester, as a rule) are being 
used more frequently for the potentiometric determination of 
amines. These electrodes are selective and have useful 
operational features. The mechanism of their functioning 
includes a ``guest-host'' complex formation stage, where the 
protonated amine cation becomes bound to the carrier molecule 
with hydrogen bonds and ion-dipole interaction. It may be 
supposed that macrocyclic polyesters are interchangeable with 
ionophores having an open chain, particularly podands--compounds 
in which the polyester chain has basic terminal groups 
(phosphine oxides, for example) attached to it. These reagents, 
similar to crown-esters, are capable of interacting with metals, 
and possibly also with amines. The procedures for synthesizing 
podands are more accessible than those of cyclic polyesters, 
thereby facilitating structural variations in the search for the 
most effective ionophore. The relative conformational lability 
of non-cyclic molecules ensures satisfactory kinetic 
characteristics of electrodes made from them. In the present 
work podands having diphenylphosphine oxide terminal groups and 
a lengthy polyester chain were synthesized and tested as 
electrode-active materials. For comparison, a study was also 
made of the properties of triphenylphosphine oxide, an analog of 
an ``isolated terminal group'', and the classic crown-ester 
dibenzo-18-crown-6. An ion selective electrode having a 
plasticized membrane based on an acyclic polyester having 
diphenylphosphine oxide terminal groups was developed and used 
to determine octylammmonium ions in aqueous solutions. The basic 
electrode characteristics were found to be a function of the 
nature of the electrode active component of the membrane. 
Ion-selective electrodes based on podands having three polyester 
oxygen atoms had optimum properties. An electrode having an 
o-nitrophenyloctyl ester as plasticizer manifested the longest 
service life (about 3 months). A method was also developed for 
the ionometric determination of octylammonium ions in model 
solutions under stationary conditions and in a counter-current 
mode. Figures 3; references 13: 5 Russian, 8 Western.

  [Abstract] A group of researchers synthesized salts of 
m-carboranedicarbonic acid and used them to produce a series of 
metal-containing polymers. The researchers synthesized oligomer 
salts of m-carboranedicarbonic acid and the following bivalent 
metals: Mg, Ca, Mn, Cu, Zn, Cd, Ba, and Pb. According to x-ray 
analysis, all of the m-carboranedicarbonic acid salts except for 
the Ba slats were crystalline substances. Most dissolved readily 
in water, as well as in alcohol and acetone in the presence of 
water. The infrared [IR] spectra of all of the salts produced 
were analogous to one another and contained absorption bands 
characteristic for a BH-carborane grouping (2,620/cm) and 
COO[.sup]-[/]-salt (1,590-1,650 and 1,270-1,300/cm) bond. 
According to the elemental analysis performed, every link of the 
salt, except in the case of the Pb salt, contained one or two 
molecules of crystallization water that can be removed by vacuum 
heating at temperatures above 100C. The water may also be 
easily replaced by materials such as acetone, diethyl ether, and 
diethylamine. The Ba salt proved to be unstable in an aqueous 
solution because of its reaction with the CO[.sup]2[/] in 
air. The IR spectra of the Ca salt after treatment with 
diethylamine also contained absorption bands in the 
2,959-2,980/cm range (characteristic of CH[.sup]2[/] and 
CH[.sup]3[/] groups). When heated in a vacuum to 220C, 
all of the salts studied decomposed and released varying amounts 
of hydrogen depending on the individual metal involved. Upon 
thermal decomposition, the Cu salt released the most hydrogen, 
and the Mn and Mg salts released the least. X-ray phase analysis 
established that heating the Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd salts to 
220-380C for 2-4 hours resulted in the formation of pure 
metals. Pure metals were also formed when the Cu, Pb, and Cd 
salts were added to polyiminoimides or phenol-formaldehyde 
resins in the amount of 30 weight percent. The size of the metal 
particles thus produced ranged from 50 to 300 angstroms 
depending on treatment temperature. The researchers expressed 
the hope that the m-carboranedicarbonic acid salts studied can 
eventually be used to dope various polymers with unoxidized 
metals in a finely dispersed state so as to produce 
metal-containing polymers with interesting electrical, magnetic, 
and other properties. Figure 1, tables 2; references 6: 2

  [Abstract] A study examined the effect of sodium tungstate 
on the photographic properties of high-resolution photographic 
materials for holography and selected nuclear photographic 
materials. The possibilities of partially replacing the silver 
halide in these emulsions by sodium tungstate was also studied. 
It was discovered that when 80 percent of the silver halide in 
the photographic material was replaced by sodium tungstate 
(i.e., when the material's silver halide content was reduced 
from 9 to 1.5 g/m[.sup]2[/]), its photographic properties 
(specifically, its light sensitivity) actually improved. 
Similarly, type MR nuclear photographic material also became 
more sensitive after 60 percent of its silver halide was 
replaced by sodium tungstate and was not otherwise adversely 
affected by the substitution. The sodium tungstate-containing 
photographic materials remained stable after thermostatted aging 
at 50C and 65 percent humidity for 3 days. The sodium 
tungstate-containing silver halide photographic materials also 
manifested a significant increase in optical density when their 
temperature was increased at the moment of exposure. This 
increase in optical density was observed throughout the entire 
light wave interval from 225 to 525 nm. When a light-sensitive 
layer containing sodium tungstate was heated to 115C, its 
optical density increased in comparison with that recorded at 
20C. For radiation at wavelengths of 325, 350, 375, 400, 
and 475 nm, the ratio of the two optical densities measured at 
115 and 20C (i.e., D[.sup]115[/]/D[.sub]20[/]) 
amounted to 50, 11, 15.5, 15, and 20, respectively. The amount 
of fog in the photographic materials with and without sodium 
tungstate was about the same. After protracted storage of 6-12 
months or more, however, more fog developed on the sodium 
tungstate-containing photographic materials than on the films 
without sodium tungstate. It was concluded that sodium tungstate 
acts as a catalyst of the silver compounds' decomposition 
process. When an antifogging agent was used or when the films 
were stored at reduced temperatures, however, the amount of fog 
in the sodium tungstate-containing photographic materials 
remained about equal to that in the films with no sodium 
tungstate. Tables 2; references 5 (Russian).

  [Abstract] Catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides to 
elemental nitrogen by various gases used as reducing agents is a 
much more promising way of recovering nitrogen oxides than 
conventional absorption and adsorption methods. Noble metals 
(i.e., platinum, palladium, ruthenium, rhodium, etc.) may serve 
as catalysts in selective reduction processes; however, their 
high cost and scarcity have spawned the search for cheaper 
alternatives. Noble metal oxides on different carriers and 
variable-valence metal oxides may be used as catalysts in 
nonselective reduction processes. In view of these facts, a 
study was undertaken to find effective non-noble 
metal-containing catalysts that could be used to reduce nitrogen 
oxides with natural gas. The experiments were performed in a 
continuous reactor unit with a stationary catalyst layer at 
temperatures of 250-590C with a space velocity of 3,000/h 
and CH[.sup]4[/]:NO[.sub]x[/] ratio of 10:1. The content 
of nitrogen oxides in the gas mixture at the reactor entrance 
and exit was determined by the calorimetric method and by 
gas-liquid chromatography. Eight catalysts were tested: STK, 
GIAP-8, NTK-10-1, NTK-10, nickel-chromium, palladized carbon, 
GIAP-16, and carbon-modified STK. With the exception of GIAP-8, 
all of the catalysts tested manifested a high catalytic activity 
during the nitrogen oxide recovery process. The main products of 
the reduction reaction were nitrogen, water, and carbon dioxide. 
A side reaction of methane and oxygen also occurred. The study 
established that most metal oxide-based commercial catalysts 
(i.e., with the exception of GIAP-8) may be used to virtually 
totally remove nitrogen oxides from gas mixtures at 
290-590C provided that the said gas mixture does not 
contain more than 3 weight percent oxygen. When greater amounts 
of oxygen are present, it is necessary to first remove the 
oxygen from the gas mixture by, for example, using a two-stage 
reactor. Tables 3; references 4 (Russian).

  [Abstract] The following new oils have been discovered in 
the territory of the Nogayskiy rayon in Dagestan: Kulinskaya, 
Nakazukhskaya, and Rifovaya. From a tectonic standpoint, the new 
deposits are all part of the Kum upheaval zone. Commercial oil 
deposits have been discovered in the sediments of the Lower 
Triassic Kum suite. The newly discovered oils were characterized 
as light, high-viscosity, high-congealing, low-sulfur, 
high-paraffin oils. The Nazakukhskaya oil was determined to be 
resinous and to have a higher coking capacity than the 
Kulinskaya or Rifovaya oils. Its yield of gasoline fractions up 
to 200C is low (12.7 to 16.9 weight percent), and its yield 
of light fractions at temperatures up to 350C ranges from 
37.3 to 44.8 weight percent. The new oils' 120-230C 
fractions fail to meet the requirements stipulated in State 
Standard [GOST] 10227-86 for jet fuels for a number of reasons, 
including density at 20C, viscosity at 20C (with the 
exception of the Kulinskaya oil), temperature of onset of 
crystallization, flash point, and acidity. Their sulfur and 
aromatic contents are quite acceptable from a jet fuel 
standpoint, however. The heavy kerosene fractions 
(150-280C) of the Nazakukhskaya and Kulinskaya oils meet 
the requirements set in branch standard OST 3801407-80 for type 
KO-20 burning kerosene; the Rifovaya oil is too acidic but may 
be used after being made more alkaline. The diesel fractions 
(140-320C) of the Nazakukhskaya and Kulinskaya oils meet 
the requirements set in GOST 305-82 for L-0.2-40 summer diesel 
fuel in all respects expect for viscosity at 20C. Rifovaya 
oil meets the said requirements in all ways except for viscosity 
at 20C and flash point. The 180-350 and 200-320C 
fractions of Nazakukhskaya oil are a good raw material for 
producing L-0.2-40 low-sulfur, low-congealing diesel fuel. All 
of the diesel fractions have a high cetane rating (58-69) thanks 
to their elevated n-alkane content, and the 200-320C 
fraction appears to be a good raw material for producing liquid 
paraffins thanks to its high n-alkane content (27-47 weight 
percent). As a raw material for catalytic cracking, the 
350-450C fractions are characterized by a low sulfur 
content (0.05-0.11 weight percent) and low coking capacity 
(0.15-0.38 weight percent) and by a virtual absence of metals. 
The new oils have also been deemed valuable raw materials for 
obtaining base-stock oils and solid paraffins with high 
indicators. In accordance with branch standard OST 38.011.97-80, 
the three new oils have all been given the identical index 
1.3.3.1.3. Figure 1, tables 4.

  [Abstract] Oxide-oxide 
ceramic eutectic composites are useful in fabricating components 
functioning at high temperatures, in aggressive media, or under 
mechanical stress. Alumina-zirconia stands out among traditional 
materials in having high hardness and resistance to wear. These 
properties also make it make it difficult to machine components 
made of these substances and for this reason they are shaped 
directly by the Stepanov method of controlled crystal growth 
which requires no further mechanical handling. It was previously 
demonstrated that ceramic eutectics of the title composition, as 
prepared by the Stepanov method, may be used as structural 
materials, although mechanical testing demonstrated poor 
consistency in properties. Bending stress, for example, varied 
from 100 to 500 MPa. This low reproducibility in properties 
evidently results from contamination of the melt with carbon 
from the graphite heating zone. In the present work a study of 
the effects of the graphite heating elements on the composition 
of alumina-zirconia-ytterbia melts was made and certain measures 
are presented for lowering carbon contamination. Figures 2;

  [Abstract] Activation of chemical reactions in the liquid 
phase with UHF-radiation has recently attracted the interest of 
researchers. It has been observed that organic compounds 
irradiated with UHF-energy in the presence of a sensitizer 
results in reactions giving products analogous to those of high 
temperature cracking (pyrolysis), and thus this process may be 
termed UHF-cracking. In the present work some results are 
presented on the UHF-cracking of liquid n-hexane, its mixtures 
with ethanol, and also UHF-cracking of n-hexane in the presence 
of other additives. The products were chiefly mixtures of light 
saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons. It was demonstrated that 
with UHF-cracking of n-hexane at atmospheric pressure, the 
ethylene content in the products exceeded 44 mole percent. The 
presence of hydroxyl-containing additives suppresses processes 
leading to the formation of coke, so that the yield of useful 
products is practically unaltered. Figures 2; references 15: 5

  [Abstract] The study of trace element compositions of crude 
oils has long since passed from purely theoretical 
considerations and now has heavy practical applications. The 
need for studying trace metal content in crudes is important 
from the geochemical, metal ore, technological, economic, and 
ecological aspects. In the present work the distribution of 
trace elements in various crudes of the paleocenozoic 
incrustation of the Afghan-Tadzhik basin are discussed in 
conjunction with an evaluation of their metal content. 
Abnormally high concentrations of a number of trace elements, 
significantly exceeding the Clarke contents of the same elements 
in clayey deposits, are indicated. Trace element enrichment of 
the crudes is largely due to hypergenic transformation 
processes, since ore-bearing concentrations of trace elements 
are related to high viscosity, heavy, asphaltic crudes. The 
crudes of the Afghan-Tadzhik basin may serve as an alternative 
source of such metals as vanadium, nickel, copper, chromium, 
cobalt, and possibly others. Figure 1; references 10 (Russian).

  [Abstract] Methods of extracting, concentrating, and 
purifying gold continue to receive a great deal of attention. As 
part of the continuing attempt to create new extractive reagents 
and sorbents that are more effective and selective than their 
existing counterparts, an attempt has been made to develop 
size-selective reagents containing two- and three-dimensional 
macrocyclic compounds (crown ethers and cryptands) as their 
active grouping. The distribution of gold in sorption systems 
containing polymeric crown ethers was studied by way of the 
example of model sulfuric acid solutions with a concentration of 
0.5 to 9 mol/l HCl. Each model solution contained 1 x 
10[.sup]-3[/] percent of each of 25 elements: Al, Au, B, Ba, 
Bi, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ga, In, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb, Sb, 
Sn, Sr, Ti, Zn, and Zr. Crown esters produced in the form of 
granulated spherical particles with a grain size of 0.3 to 0.6 
mm were studied. Both macroporous and gel-type crown ethers were 
used. During the experiments, 0.1 g of polymeric crown ether was 
placed in contact with 10 ml of a model solution at a 
temperature of 23 +/- 1C for 48 hours. The element content 
of each solution before and after sorption was determined on 
AESP-1 and ISAR-61 atomic emission spectrometers by using a 
specially developed method capable of detecting gold in 
concentrations as low as 0.04 ml/l with an error not exceeding 
10 percent. As was initially hypothesized, the overwhelming 
majority of the elements included in the model sulfuric acid 
solutions behaved as in processes of extraction by monomeric 
crown ethers of analogous structure under comparable conditions. 
The gold, however, behaved quite differently in the sorption 
systems than it does during an extraction process. During the 
sorption process there was a virtually quantitative extraction 
of gold throughout the entire acidity range from 0.5 to 9 mol/l 
HCl. Sorption of the gold peaked in the range from 1 to 3 mol/l 
HCl, where the highest gold distribution coefficient 
[D[.sup]Au[/]] values were observed for all of the crown 
ethers tested. The gel-type crown ethers did not extract gold or 
any of the other elements and were thus eliminated from further 
consideration. The porous-type sorbents extracted trace 
quantities of gold effectively; however, the value of 
D[.sup]Au[/] was significantly dependent on both the sizes of 
the macrocycle in the polymeric crown ether and the type of 
attachment of the macrocycle to the polymer matrix. When the 
size of the macrocycle and number of oxygen atoms was increased 
in the series 18-crown-6, 21-crown-7, 24-crown-8 for one and the 
same type of polymeric crown ether, 
D[.sup]Au[/][.sup]max[/] decreased from 2686 for the crown 
ether PDB18K6 to 2289 for PDB21K7 and 1190 for PBD24K8. All of 
the specified crown ethers had nearly identical amounts of 
active groupings within the confines of 2.0-2.1 mgEq/g, which 
indicated that crown ethers containing derivatives of the 
macrocycle 18-crown-6 as active groupings are the most effective 
sorbents of gold. The selectivity of the polymeric crown ethers 
tested was found to depend on both the dimensions of the 
functional macrocycle and the method used to fix it in the 
polymer matrix. Greater effectiveness in extracting gold (higher 
values of D[.sup]Au[/]) were accompanied by decreased process 
selectivity. The polycondensation-type sorbents, i.e., PDB21K7 
and PDB24K8 produced by reacting crown ethers and formaldehyde, 
were found to offer the best compromise between effectiveness of 
extraction and selectivity in processes of sorption of gold from 
0.5- to 2-mol/l solutions of HCl. Figure 1, tables 2; references 
6 (Russian).

  [Abstract] The development of effective photocatalysts is 
closely related to the search for ways to eliminate undesirable 
deactivation processes resulting in the dissipation of 
photoenergy into heat or luminescence whereby a significant 
portion of the light quanta absorbed by the photocatalyst is 
expended without inducing chemical reactions. In the case of 
semiconductor catalysts, the main deactivating process is 
recombination of generated photoexcited charges, i.e. electrons 
in the conductance zone and holes in the valency zone. 
Therefore, in considering the possibility of using any 
particular semiconductor as a photocatalyst, preference is 
usually given to materials in which electron-hole recombination 
is not well pronounced. In this respect, heterojunctions are of 
special interest. These are systems consisting of a 
semiconductor matrix with some other semiconductor material 
superimposed on its surface. One special property of such 
semiconductor heterojunctions is their very efficient and in 
some cases irreversible ability to separate photogenerated 
electrons and holes by transferring one of these charge carriers 
or both from the semiconductor-matrix zone to the 
semiconductor-heterojunction zone, or vice versa. These 
semiconductors should have very high photocatalytic activity and 
indeed many have found practical applications as photodiodes, 
transistors, solar energy converters, etc. Currently available 
data on these heterojunctions refers mainly to dispersed 
coprecipitation products (cadmium and silver sulfides, copper 
(I) and cadmium, copper (I), cadmium, and zinc). The 
photocatalytic activity of these systems in hydrogen evolution 
reactions from aqueous sulfide-sulfite solutions is much higher 
than for the individual metals, which is attributed to the 
presence of microheterojunctions between similar semiconductors 
and the coprecipation products. In the present work a study was 
made of the preparation and photocatalytic properties of 
heterojunctions made from cadmium sulfide and sulfur-containing 
heterocomponents formed from copper (I), copper (II), and 
bismuth (III) ions. Photocatalytic activity of the prepared 
semiconductors materials was studied for the reaction of 
molecular hydrogen evolution from alcohol-water suspensions. The 
studies demonstrated that the photocatalytic properties of these 
materials are largely comparable with the properties of cadmium 
sulfide, although there are some differences. All three 
materials containing Cu[.sup]+[/], Cu[.sup]2+[/], or 
Bi[.sup]3+[/] manifest a photocatalytic activity under light 
of the same spectral range as that of non-modified CdS, although 
in the case of hydrogen formation, the reaction proceeds at a 
considerably faster rate. Figures 1; references 6: 5 Russian, 1 
Western.

  [Abstract] The development of new electrode materials from 
polymeric cyanoferrates is sustaining a steady interest. It has 
been demonstrated that hexacyanoferrate of iron (III), HCFI or 
Prussian Blue, is a promising substance for use in 
electro-optical devices using the electro-chromic effect and in 
electrical storage devices. HCFI is one of the most efficient 
converters of electrical charges in optical absorption and it 
has a high and stable coloration-discoloration rate. 
Modifications in composition and properties of polymeric 
cyanoferrates for the purpose of broadening their range of 
applications in electronic devices operating in conjunction with 
other known electro-chromic materials, such as tungsten 
trioxide, remains a pressing problem. Recently, HCFI analogs 
having various extra-spherical cations have been prepared. An 
alternate method for modifying HCFI properties lies in 
substituting the ligands in the coordination sphere (cyanide 
ions), i.e. preparing a variety of pentacyanoferrates of iron 
(III). The significant differences between the physical chemical 
properties of the pentacyanide complexes and that of the highly 
symmetrical hexacyanides makes it possible to propose that a 
change in the symmetry of the ligand make-up of the iron atoms 
in the polymeric pentacyanoferrates must also have a significant 
effect on the physical chemical properties of the materials, 
including optical and electrochemical. In the present work an 
analog of Prussian Blue, aquapentacyanoferrate of iron (III), 
was prepared and a study was made of the effects of the 
composition of polymeric cyanoferrates on the physical chemical 
properties, structure, and electrochemical behavior of the 
resulting materials. Figures 2; references 10: 4 Russian, 6

  [Abstract] The spin density wave (polaron) related to 
charge transfer along the chain of conjugated -bonds of an 
electrically conductive polymer causes polarization of spin 
states. One approach to the study of these processes may be 
based on the utilization of a model polymer containing 
paramagnetic dopants. In the present work a study was made of 
the possibility of preparing and the properties of polypyrrole 
doped with tetracyanoethylene anion-radicals. A broadening in 
the EPR spectral line after introduction of the anion-radical 
was observed. This could have been caused by a slow spin-spin 
exchange between the radical and the polar polymer chain. Figure 
1; references 6 (Western).

  [Abstract] The use of concatenated systems as a coding 
standard for telemetry channels recommended by the Consultative 
Committee for Space Data Systems (KKSKD) whereby the code system 
consists of identical external Reed-Solomon (RS) codes and a 
single convolutional code with memory and free distance is 
discussed, and the possibility of realizing an additional energy 
gain in such systems using generalized concatenated codes is 
investigated in the case where there are eight external 
Reed-Solomon codes, and the total concatenated code length is 
32,640 bits. The study shows that generalized convolutional 
block codes with different external Reed-Solomon codes are much 
better from the energy viewpoint than simple convolutional 
concatenated block codes. The structures based on quaternary 
phase modulation (FM4) which employ the property of signal 
system embedding and two different internal convolutional codes 
result in an additional energy gain, and the total energy gain 
compare to the CCSDS standard in the most optimum simulation and 
analysis points reaches 0.9 dB. The findings point toward the 
expediency of using the proposed generalized concatenated 
structures in channels with white Gaussian noise, particularly 
in space and satellite communications systems. Figures 3; tables

  [Abstract] When developing dispersion delay lines (DDL) on 
surface acoustic waves (SAW) with 90 reflecting structures, 
in order to obtain amplitude-frequency characteristic of a 
specified form, a weighing is used by changing the position of 
individual reflecting elements. This method is called a phase 
weighing method. The method is based on lowering the amplitude 
of the reflected wave by shifting two adjoining elements into 
opposite directions. In this study, the phase weighing method 
was used for constructing DDL with slanted reflecting structures 
made with grooves. A diagram of such DDL using a SAW with 
inclined reflecting structures is provided. Two types of DDL 
made with YZ- LiNbO[.sup]3[/] were constructed and their 
parameters and functioning is described. Interdigital 
transducers with equidistant electrodes were employed for the 
DDL. The first type transducer contained four pairs of digits 
and the second type contained ten pairs. The amplitude-frequency 
characteristics and the shape of the compressed pulse at the 
ouput of both types of the DDL are shown in graphs. It was 
demonstrated that the method of phase weighing is very effective 
for obtaining the DDL amplitude-frequency characteristic of a 
specified configuration. Figures 5, references 9: 3 Russian, 6

  [Abstract] A problem of determining the real 
characteristicsof the Earth's surface from its radar image, 
obtained by a radarwith a synthesized aperture is examined in 
this article. Theradar located on an aircraft moving in a 
straight line at aconstant elevation scans a section of the 
Earth surface in aprojection mode, where the transmitting and 
the receiving antennas are continuously directed to this 
section. The transmitting antenna radiates a probing signal, 
consisting of two electromagnetic waves with a parallel and 
perpendicular polarization; the receiving antenna records a 
signal, which is a combination of two waves generated by 
scattering of the probing signal by the Earth's surface. The 
problem consists of finding the scattering coefficient from the 
known radiating and received signals. With this information the 
Fourier form of the f(x,y)projection and the projection itselves 
can be determined, butonly for a narrow angular section. In 
order to reconstruct thef(x,y) function for the entire region, a 
method is developed fordetermining the scattering coefficient as 
a function of the characteristic of the Earth surface with a 
radar, making it possible to compute the desired coefficient 
using the data from apartial angular section, applying effective 
algorithms. Figures2, references 8Russian.

  [Abstract] The rate of sedimentation as a function of 
geometrical parameters, such as the beam diameter and distance 
between the beam axis and substrate, was examined for the 
conditions of laser-chemical deposition of silicon from a 
mixture of monosilane with argon under the effect of continuous 
CO[.sup]2[/] laser. Procedures are described for measurements 
of the deposition rate. To minimize the edge effect of the 
heater measurements, depending on the distance between the beam 
and the substrate the measurements were made at the same beam 
section. The chemical kinetics in this case is primarily 
determined by the gas temperature, therefore, to a great extent, 
the problem of the rate and the deposition conditions can be 
solved by examining the distribution of gas temperature in the 
reactor volume, depending on the parameters of the experiment. 
The direct measurements of the gas temperature near the laser 
beam were compared with the results of numerical computations of 
the temperature fields in the cavity, produce by an electric 
heater of the substrate as well as by the gas absorption of the 
laser radiation. Based on the experimental results and data in 
the literature, it can be concluded that a developed 
photoabsorption convection is being developed under the examined 
conditions, which significantly changes the temperature field in 
the cavity. It is apparent that for construction of an adequate 
theoretical model of laser-chemical deposition, the convection 
must be taken into the account under the examined conditions.

  [Abstract] Nonlinear-optical properties of glasses with 
microcrystals of a semiconductor compound 
CuInS[.sup]2x[/]Se[.sub]2(1-x)[/] (belonging to the 
A[.sup]1[/]B[.sup]3[/]C[.sup]6[/][.sup]2[/] type), 
whose edge of the fundamental absorption band lies in the near 
infrared spectral region (1-1.4m), were experimentally 
examined in this paper. The relationships of energy transmission 
as a function of peak intensity of the incident ultrashort 
pulses (USP), and the kinetics of changes in absorption of the 
exploring USP at different intensities of the excitation 
radiation and the width of the prohibited zone were also 
studied. Single USP of the fundamental and second harmonics of 
YAlO[.sup]3[/]:Nd laser with a passive synchronization of the 
modes were used as the excitation source and for probing. The 
USP duration was about 15 ps. 
CuInS[.sup]2x[/]Se[.sub]2(1-x)[/] microcrystals, dispersed 
in a silicate glass, with 1.06, 1.14,, 1.17, and 1.22 eV width 
of the prohibited zone were examined and the results are shown 
in a graph. The experiments demonstrated that in glasses 
containing semiconductor microcrystals 
CuInS[.sup]2x[/]Se[.sub]2(1-x)[/], the character and time 
parameters of the kinetics of the absorption changes, induced by 
picosecond light pulses, depend on the excitation level, and 
also on the photon energy of the excitation and probing pulses.

  [Abstract] Passive synchronization of the modes of YAG:Nd 
and YAlO[.sup]3[/] lasers using 
CuInS[.sup]2x[/]Se[.sub]2(1- x)[/]-doped glasses is 
discussed. The optical block diagram of the laser is provided 
and its functioning is described. The laser resonator is formed 
by a spherical mirror and a planar output mirror. A passive 
synchronization of modes was obtained when glasses with 
CuInS[.sup]1.2[/]Se[.sub]0.8[/] monocrystal were used as 
passive gates in pulsed solid state neodymium lasers. The pulse 
width was 36 and 16 ns for the YAG:Nd-and YAlO[.sup]3[/]:Nd 
lasers, respectively. The passive gates operate as saturating 
absorbers at low intensities and perform negative feed-back at 
high radiation intensities. The glasses with 
CuInS[.sup]2x[/]Se[.sub]2(1-x)[/] are a promising material 
for semiconductor cavity saturating absorbers for solid state 
lasers operating in a self-starting mode. The saturating 
absorbers exhibit a rapid relaxation, and have low losses and 
high saturation intensities. They can operate in a nonlinear 
mode within resonators of solid state lasers, interacting with 
pulse intensities in a pico range. The required operating wave 
length can be selected within the 0.9-1.3 m range by 
changing 
the stoichiometry coefficient and composition of the glass.

  [Abstract] Photophysical properties of a new complex active 
molecule 1.4-phenylen-2.2'bisoxazol (OPO) were examined. This 
molecule is capable of fluorescence and light generation in the 
wavelength region _l_=340 - 420 nm with a high quantum 
efficiency of fluorescence _g_=0.45-0.93 and low threshold 
pumping density in different solvents. It was demonstrated that 
the solvent affects the localization of the electron density of 
the atoms and fragments of the complex OPO molecule in the 
fundamental state. Because of changes in the distribution of the 
length of linkages in the cycles of the OPO molecules, when the 
hydrogen atom attacks the individual pair of electrons of the 
nitrogen atoms, the structure of excited electron singlet 
(S[.sup]*[/][.sup]i[/]) and triplet (T[.sub]i[/]) 
states and transitions, determining the photophysical 
characteristics of the complex compounds is changing. Spectral- 
fluorescence and generation characteristics of the complex 
heteroatomic molecule OPO in different solvents and in a gas 
phase were measured and computed. It was also demonstrated that 
increasing or decreasing of the pumping density in vapors, or 
changing the solvent properties, is related to a dynamic 
separation or overlapping of the light generation bands on 
transitions. A feasibility is demonstrated that the a priori- 
structural modeling method can be used for controlling the 
properties of the excited states and junctions. Figures 4, 
tables 3, references 53: 40 Russian, 13 Western.

  [Abstract] A method is proposed for construction of 
multiplex systems of fiber-optical interferometric sensors 
entirely without optical directional couplers. In these systems, 
the signal waves are formed by reflecting a portion of the 
radiation, propagating in the fiber lightguide, from semi- 
transparent mirrors, built within it, or from the internal 
nonhomogenieties of the lightguide itself. When they arrive back 
into the laser cavity, the lasing amplitude changes. Small 
changes in the length of the optical path in the lightguide, 
caused by the physical effects, which are being examined, can be 
detected by controlling the laser output. Theoretical 
relationships are developed for a frequency-modulated laser with 
optical feedback and the carrier frequency modulation method for 
multiplex sensors is discussed. Modulation characteristics of a 
He-Ne laser, the bistability of the longitudinal modes are 
examined and the effect of cross-talk is estimated. Autodyne 
multiplex sensors including underwater acoustics antenna and 
temperature sensors are also briefly discussed. The experimental 
study of frequency-scanned He-Ne-laser operating with different 
lightguide systems demonstrated that an autodyne detection is 
suitable for application with distributed sensors employing a 
Rayleigh scattering signal. Figures 9,references 12: 4 Russian,

  [Abstract] A method for determining the quantum 
effectiveness of photo-detectors is described. This method is 
based on the analysis of the photocurrent dispersion 
fluctuations with a priori specified statistics of the radiation 
field. Thus, the spectral sensitivity of the photo-detector can 
be determined with a single electron formation process of the 
photocurrent. A device for experimental determination of the 
effectiveness of a silicon photodiode FD-7K was constructed. Its 
block diagram is provided and the experimental procedures are 
described. Light- emitting diodes AL-307 and AL-107, with 
_l_[.sup]max[/]=0.67 and 0.95 m, respectively, were used 
as sources of radiation. Before determining the quantum 
effectiveness of the photo-detector, curves of the shot current 
dispersion for different radiation intensities were first 
obtained, and are shown in a graph. Figures 2, table 1,

  [Abstract] Photo-detectors based on gallium arsenide and 
indium phosphide are examined in this paper. These 
photodetectors are suitable for operation in a structure of 
three-dimensional integrated microcircuits with optical 
linkages. Of the familiar types of GaAs photodetectors, the 
metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) photodetectors are the most 
attractive from the point of view of being able to obtain 
ultimately high speed and sensitivity, and because of their 
technological compatibility with the fundamental element of GaAs 
integrated circuits - the field effect transistor. The structure 
of the examined MSM-photodetector is described and its spectral 
characteristic is shown in a graph. As shown in the curves, the 
maximum spectral sensitivity is located at the absorption edge 
of the gallium arsenide (_l_[.sup]1[/]=0.87, where a sharp 
peak is observed. The second maximum appears at 
_l_[.sup]2[/]=1.2-1.3 m. Presence of two spectral 
photo-sensitivity regions with different characteristic times, 
offers an additional capacity for controlling the information 
flow using two wave-lengths. Results of studying the indium 
phosphide photodiodes are discussed and graphs showing their 
cross section and topology, as well as their volt-ampere 
characteristic are provided. The spectral characteristic of an 
InP photodiode is also shown in a graph. Figures 7, references

  [Abstract] A thin-film dielectric light polarizer is 
proposed for analysis and control of polarization conditions. 
The polarizer performance is based on the earlier established 
phenomenon of polarization anisotropy of optical characteristic 
of the dielectric layer with corrugated edges. Unlike the 
existing thin-film dielectric polarizers, the proposed optical 
element is a relatively simple construction intended for 
operation under a normal angle of incidence. For experimental 
testing of the proposed device, samples of dielectric polarizer 
were constructed and its function is described. The experiments 
demonstrated a feasibility of developing thin-film polarization 
element based on a dielectric layer with corrugated edges. 
Compared to the polarization structures made of metal, the 
technology of constructing corrugated structures on the surface 
of a dielectric is more simple, while polarization efficiency of 
the tested samples was sufficient for application with some 
optoelectronic devices. Figures 4, references 4: 2 Russian, 2

  [Abstract] Features of employing 
A[.sup]II[/]B[.sup]VI[/] semiconductor compounds, 
specifically cadmium sulfide-selenide, in a form of thin-film 
photodetector structures, are examined for different elements of 
optoelectronic processor. A technology was developed in the 
Belorus Academy of Sciences for obtaining thin-film photo- 
resistors based on cadmium sulfide-selenide, which includes: a 
cathode three-electron scattering on direct current and high 
frequency voltage of a cold-pressed target, activation of photo- 
sensitivity by thermal processing of films in the original 
batch, photo-lithographic operations for obtaining the required 
topology of micro-elements on thin-film of cadmium 
sulfide-selenide and In - A[.sup]II[/]B[.sup]VI[/], Al - 
Ti - A[.sup]II[/]B[.sup]VI[/] contact systems. Thin-film 
photo- resistor structures 0.5-2.0 m thick can be formed 
with 
this technology on different substrates with a sufficiently high 
photoelectric quality. Experimental data are provided, 
supporting the feasibility of application of thin-film

application as a reversive memory medium with electro-optical 
information reading, when the state of the medium element is 
determined by the polarization direction in the ferro-electric 
material were examined. The electrophysical characteristics of 
this medium are discussed. This ferro-electric material was 
selected because in addition to other high electro-optical 
parameters it exhibits other qualities: a high melting 
temperature, small values of piezoelectric losses, time 
stability of the samples, a high value of dielectric constant, 
etc. Thin- film (In[.sup]2[/]O,[.sub]3[/] + 
SnO[.sup]2[/]) - SBN film - (In[.sub]2[/]O,[.sub]3[/] + 
SnO[.sup]2[/]), obtained by high frequency sputtering method 
on sapphire substrates were used for the studies. Based on 
comparative analysis of different contemporary methods for 
obtaining multi- component 2 - 5 m thick ferroelectric

it can be assumed that at the present time the high frequency 
sputtering is a preferred method. Figures 5, references 39: 12

  [Abstract] A method for designing an optical associative 
memory device (OAMD) in the form of an integrated microcircuit 
using electro-optical thin-film modulators, integrated-optical 
splitter, a and light beam integrator is proposed. Estimates are 
made of the fundamental parameters of the microcircuit. It is 
demonstrated that the OAMD can be made in the form of a 
multilayer thin-film structure with optical interconnectors. 
Works are carried out now at the Institute of Automatics and 
Electrometry practically in all directions of the microcircuit 
development. Different models of light beam splitter are being 
studied. A splitter mock-up is developed for 16 light beams 
exhibiting a nonuniformity of diffraction efficiency smaller 
than 5%. Technology is mastered for producing 
high-efficiency 
diffraction optical elements. Ferroelectric films of strontium 
barium niobate are synthesized. A construction is proposed of a 
thin-film light polarizer with the polarization ratio of 50:1. 
Experimentally, a 20:1 ratio was obtained. Figures 6, references

  [Abstract] Several options for parallel optical linkages 
between simple two-layer neural-like uniform computing 
structures, based on a light modulator - photodetector couple 
are examined. Two design methods of optical multilayer three- 
dimensional computing devices are possible: With the first 
method, the complex functional circuits, made for each layer 
using the traditional silicon p-n-technology are connected to 
each other by optical information channels. With the second 
method, the layers are formed based on simple optical logic 
circuits. The advantages and disadvantages of both methods are 
discussed. Block diagrams and functional circuits of the 
structures and samples of parallel computations including 
simultaneous storage of the results and initial information are 
provided with the text. The examples of two-layer optical 
computing structures are functionally not perfect, but a 
combination of such devices in multilayer computing structures 
increases their functional capacity and flexibility by a several 
orders of magnitude, and can be effectively employed for binary 
and neural computations. Figures 5, references 5: 4 Russian, 1

  [Abstract] A structural circuit of a neural network 
employing an algorithm for sorting a sequence of n-numbers is 
examined. The structural circuit takes into account the 
limitations concerning engineering implementation of the 
proposed circuits on an optical neural chip. The examined 
structural circuit was modeled as a package of computer 
programs. The circuit consists of an adaptive neural network, 
whose weight coefficients are adjusted depending on the input 
data. Modeling of the neural network for n=256 with a program 
package allowed to experimentally test the convergence of the 
proposed neural algorithm and to verify the obtained analytical 
time estimates of its performance. With the contemporary 
technology of VLSIC, it is possible to develop neural chips 
capable of sorting 512 numbers during a single cycle. Figures 9,

  [Abstract] Based on the methods of parallel 
microprogramming, a method is proposed for transformation of a 
two-dimensional structure into a three-dimensional. Two options 
are described here of the proposed multiplication algorithm of 
two integer n-digit numbers with a fixed comma. Using these 
algorithms, structural multiplier circuits on electrooptical 
programmable logic array (PLA) are designed with a different 
number of layers k&gt;  2p, where p is the number of logic layers, 
and the complexity of their implementation are estimated. The 
fundamental concepts of parallel microprogramming and the basic 
multiplication algorithm of integer n-dimensional numbers are 
described. Single layer electrooptical models of the proposed 
and the developed multipliers are discussed. Different 
stratification options of the multipliers and the difficulties 
involving their realization with electrooptical programmable 
logic arrays are also discussed. Figures 7, tables 4, references 
17: 13 Russian, 4 Western.

  [Abstract] The proliferation of today's composite materials 
consisting of heterogeneous mixtures of various particles bound 
by a common matrix in aerospace engineering, modern microwave 
devices, nonlinear composite resistors, and high-temperature 
heaters necessitated an investigation into the electrophysical 
properties of such materials in RF fields. To this end, the 
behavior of dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability is 
examined in greater detail; in particular, the random frequency 
variance of the dielectric constant, the dependence of the 
static conductivity of a nonordered mixture of insulator and 
conductor particles on the relative bulk concentration of 
conducting particles, the behavior of the dielectric constant 
and conductivity as a function of concentration, the frequency 
dependence of the effective dielectric constant and magnetic 
permeability and their real and imaginary parts, etc., are 
plotted. Attention is focused on the behavior of these constants 
near the conductivity threshold in electromagnetic fields 
allowing for the electromagnetic field skinning. The use of 
quasicritical systems for attaining high dielectric constants in 
RF fields is addressed. It is noted that the scope of the paper 
makes it virtually impossible to describe numerous properties 
inherent in composite structures in the RF spectrum since there 
are no natural materials capable of even marginally meeting the 
broad range of today's needs. It is speculated that the 
development of future materials will require further development 
of both a comprehensive body of theoretical data and adequate 
practices which realize complex spatial structures. Figures 28; 
references 34: 10 Russian, 24 Western.

  [Abstract] The Zont-M complex which generates the 
helicopter landing light control system (STO) signals on a ship 
or drilling rig is described. The Zont-M system generates 0.3 A, 
27 V direct current signals and transmits them to the floating 
drilling rig (PPBU) or ship deck and 0-10 V DC signals matched 
to a 10 k_o_ load for the on-board computer. The Zont-M system 
generates control signals which are proportionate to the angle 
of roll within +/-10 at a 1 step, to the change in the 
angle of roll, to the angle of trim within +/-5 at a 1 
step, and to the change in the angle of trim, as well as a 
signal indicating the a change in the direction of he vertical 
linear velocity component perpendicular to the deck plane. 
Operation of the system requires data on the pitching, rolling, 
heaving, and yaw angles from such external sources as vertical 
gyro or synchro resolver. The system ensures the necessary 
accuracy (0.5 roll and trim, 0.2 m heaving, and 0.2 m/s 
linear velocity component) in rough seas of up to force 5 within 
a 0-40C temperature range at speeds of up to 20 knots. A 
block diagram of the Zont-M system and its front panel are 
cited, and the operating procedure is outlined in detail. The 
system uses 150 W, 220 V, 50/60 Hz power supply, and its 
electric circuits are executed on 4-mm thick 220x130 mm boards 
and are splashproof. The system meets all Register 
specifications. Figures 2; references 1.

sciences, and A.G. Manuylenko, Yu.D. Kapustin, and M.A. 
Kovalenko, engineers, Rostov Oblast Institute for the Design and 
Planning of Electrical Equipment for Heat Engineering 
Installations [Teploelektroproyekt]; UDC 621.472] 
  [Abstract] The Russian state scientific-technical program 
``Ecologically Pure Power Generation'' calls for the development 
of a plan to erect an experimental solar electric power plant in 
Kislovodsk. The Rostov Teploelektroproyekt has been named 
general designer of the new solar electric power plant, and the 
Power Engineering Institute imeni G.M. Krzhizhanovskiy has been 
put in charge of creating it. The planned 1.5-MW-capacity 
modular solar electric power plant will be used to partially 
cover the electricity and heat demand of users in the plant's 
vicinity. The plant will consist of two independent parts: The 
first will convert solar radiation into electricity by using 
solar batteries based on silicon single crystals and 
polycrystals, and the second part (the thermodynamic part) will 
use Stirling motor-generators (i.e., electrical generators 
connected to a Stirling motor that is excited by solar 
radiation) as converters. The new solar electric power plant 
includes the following components: four fields of solar 
photoeletric modules; two fields of solar modules with Stirling 
motor-generators; a field of solar water-heating modules; three 
inverter substations; and control, regulation, protection, and 
automation systems. The station's circuit includes three 
independent solar power units that are connected through 
transformers to a common system of station generator buses. 
Together, the solar modules' design peak capacity is 1,907 kWe. 
The new solar electric power plant's basic technical-economic 
indicators are as follows: peak intensity of solar radiation 
flux, 0.9 kW/m[.sup]2[/]; number of hours of sunshine 
annually, 2,147; total yearly solar radiation, 1,345 
kWh/m[.sup]2[/]; peak electrical capacity, 1.6 MWh; peak 
thermal capacity, 10.5 MW; yearly output of power to consumers, 
1,560 MWh of electricity and 46,000 GJ of heat; average thermal 
efficiency of the solar modules, 57 percent; total area occupied 
by the fields of solar modules, 10.7 hectares; area of the solar 
modules' active receiving surface, 35,280 m[.sup]2[/]; 
specific capital investments per unit power, 6,770 rubles/kW for 
electricity and 5,000 for heat; cost of producing electricity, 
34.8 kopecks/kWh; cost of producing heat, 76.5 rubles/GJ; and 
number of servicing personnel required, 64. The new solar 
electric power plant has a design service life of 30 years, and 
the electricity and heat produced by it should reduce wastes 
released into the environment by the following amounts: 7,000 
tons of ash; 18,000 tons of carbon oxides; 1,400 tons of 
nitrogen; and 3,800 tons of sulfur. The new solar electric power 
plant should also reduce heat emissions by 7 x 10[.sup]8[/] J 
and should conserve the 12,000 tons of atmospheric oxygen 
conventionally required to burn fossil fuel in boiler furnaces. 
The new Kislovodsk solar electric power plant is slated to be 
completed in 1996. Figure 1, table 1; references 8: 2 Russian, 6

  [Abstract] The ``Conception for the Development of the 
Nuclear Power Industry in the Russian Federation Under the New 
Economic Conditions'' was approved by the Russian government on 
10 September 1992. A group of experts examined the policy 
statement and drew a number of conclusions regarding it. The 
group's overall conclusion was that the scales assumed regarding 
the development of nuclear energy for the production of power 
and heat are based on a single unfounded scenario for the future 
development of Russia's economy and power industry. The group 
went on to suggest that the policy statement be rejected in its 
present form and revised to include a special program of 
emergency measures to prevent the possible occurrence and 
development of large-scale accidents at now-operational nuclear 
power facilities until they are shut down and to reduce the 
harmful environmental effects of stored radwaste and spent 
nuclear fuel during its storage and reprocessing. Included among 
the other points raised in the group's 11-point reaction to the 
policy statement were the following: 
1) the policy statement does not acknowledge the existence of 
alternative, economically sounder versions of covering that 
portion of Russia's future power demand that is slated to be 
covered by nuclear power; 
2) the assessment of the current status of Russia's nuclear 
power industry presented in the policy statement significantly 
distorts the true state of the industry and paints it in a 
manner favorable to the RF Ministry of Atomic Energy; 
3) the extensive program of construction of new nuclear power 
facilities, including facilities with RBMK reactors, in all 
parts of the country called for in the policy statement is 
unacceptable; 
4) the ecological arguments in favor of expansion of the 
nuclear power industry (especially the argument that increased 
use of nuclear power will result in decreased burning of fossil 
fuel) that are included in the policy statement are not, either 
individually or in their entirety, sufficient grounds for 
further expanding nuclear power generation in Russia by 
2000-2010; 
5) the harmful effects of nuclear power generation on the 
environment, both because of accidents and because of flaws in 
the technology, are well known and eliminate any basis for the 
statement that atomic energy is safe on an ecological plane; 
6) Russia's unified electric power systems are sufficient to 
meet her fuel and power demands for several decades without any 
need to increase her nuclear power industry; 
7) the projected cost estimates of the proposed plan for 
augmenting Russia's nuclear power industry are unfounded 
because, as previously stated, the plan only considers one 
possible scenario; 
8) Russia has a broad spectrum of alternatives to expansion of 
its nuclear power industry (including controlling heat use in 
the domestic and industrial sectors, redesigning new gas-fired 
boiler units to produce electricity and heat in the form of 
steam and hot water, equipping existing steam turbine units with 
gas turbine-based topping stations, and increasing the use of 
coals from the Kansk-Achinsk and Kuznetsk basins; 
9) the policy statement largely ignores international 
experience in the area of nuclear power plant construction; 
10) the policy statement does not provide any mechanism for the 
public's involvement in decisions regarding constructing nuclear 
power enterprises or for providing the public with objective 
information regarding Russia's radiation situation. Tables 2.

  [Abstract] Reports that optimum gas transport control of a 
gas main may help lower the power consumption for housekeeping 
needs by up to 1% prompted the development of a 
principally new 
technique and mathematical model and algorithms for on-line 
optimum control of the gas main operating conditions in the case 
with successively positioned compressor stations equipped with 
centrifugal gas transfer plants (GPA). The desired effect is 
achieved by ensuring the optimum compressor station inlet and 
outlet gas pressures with changes in the gas flow or other 
transported gas parameters. The technique for on-line control of 
the gas main (MG) operating conditions is described in detail; 
three stages are considered: developing the optimum 
energy-economic characteristics (EEKhKS) for each compressor 
station (KS), establishing the optimum gas pressures on the 
basis of the mathematical model of the gas main and the above 
optimum compressor station energy-economic characteristics, and 
establishing the optimum inlet and outlet gas flows transported 
through the transfer plants at each compressor stations. It is 
suggested that the models be implemented on microcomputers which 
may be placed at dispatcher control centers and that changes in 
the process parameters be taken into account directly in the 
course of operation. Figures 2; references 5.

  [Text] The manipulator is a mechanical structure with a 
large number of articulated elements and, as a rule, a large 
number of degrees of freedom. In a perfect structure, such a 
manipulator may assume any shape in the three-dimensional space. 
This exceptional flexibility makes it possible to employ 
manipulators in various fields of industry where the 
maneuverability space is highly constrained. 
  This flexibility engenders new problems: how to monitor each 
element when the arm is moving within a constrained space with 
obstacles and eliminate collision with them, what is the optimum 
control of various arm elements which can realize the necessary 
trajectory, etc.? 
  It is obvious that in order to improve this manipulator's 
maneuverability, the number of elements must be quite high. 
Assuming that each element has two-to-three degrees of freedom 
relative to the preceding one, it becomes necessary to use a 
large number of actuators and devices which leads to an increase 
in its mass and worsens the manipulator's technical 
characteristics, such as its speed of response, positioning 
accuracy, load-bearing capacity, etc. The solution to this 
problem amounts to positioning actuators beyond the elements and 
transmitting energy to a distance with the help of an adequate 
mechanical, pneumatic, or electric system. 
  An original simplified manipulator design (Figs. 1a and b) 
and an analysis of some of its parameters are presented in this 
article. 
  The manipulator contains base 1 which houses the following: 
stepping electric motor 2 and precision reduction gear 3 
containing a satellite gear cluster 4 consisting of roller gear 
rims 5 and 6 and sun gears 8 and 9 installed on crank 7. Gear 8 
is linked to the base while driven sun gear 9 with gear-type 
coupling 10 and clutch 11 is linked to the first link 12 after 
the base. The manipulator also contains moving links 13-15 
connected to each other by ball and socket joints 16-18. 
Flexible tie 19 one of whose ends is connected through spring 20 
to link 15 and the other end--to the screw of the ball and screw 
transmission 21 located in the hub of the driven sun gear 9 
passes through moving links 12-15. Each moving link 12-15 is 
connected to the flexible tie by a centering mechanism. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-006C-14A>           Fig. 1. Manipulator Design. </FIG>




  Each centering mechanism is executed as two controlled 
fixtures: controlled fixtures 22 and 23 are installed in link 
13, controlled fixtures 24 and 25 are installed in link 14, and 
controlled fixtures 26 and 27 are installed in link 15. The 
screw of the ball and screw transmission is connected to link 12 
by the second clutch 28 while link 12 is connected to the 
flexible tie by controlled fixture 29. Each controlled fixture 
is executed as an electromagnet whose core is articulated with 
the flexible tie. 
  The manipulator operates as follows. When the electric motor 
is switched on, the satellite gear cluster performs a precession 
movement whereby the roller gear rims engage the sun gears. 
Furthermore, driven sun gear 9 rotates with a reduction which is 
determined by the number of rollers in gear rims 5 and 6 and the 
number of teeth in sun gears 8 and 9. When the clutch is 
engaged, gear 9 begins to rotate, and rotation is converted by 
the ball and screw transmission into reciprocation motion of the 
screw linked to the flexible tie. Thus, given a certain 
combination of controlled fixture operations, one can obtain the 
necessary slope angle of any moving link. For example, if 
controlled fixtures are engaged simultaneously, the manipulator 
may assume the position shown in Fig. 1. In this case, the 
controlled fixtures operate in different directions in each 
pair. For example, in order to link 13 around the center of the 
ball and socket joint 16, it is necessary that controlled 
fixture 23 pull flexible tie 19 in one direction, while 
controlled fixture 24--in the other direction relative to the 
longitudinal axis of link 13. The link rotation angle is 
determined as the arc tangent of the ratio of the core 
displacement _D_ S to the distance between the center of the 
ball and socket joint 16 and the longitudinal axis of the 
corresponding controlled fixture 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-006C-15A>           Equation </FIG>



  Thus, the procession reduction gear with the ball and screw 
transmission and centering mechanisms with the flexible tie make 
it possible to obtain any manipulator displacement in one plane 
bounded by the service area while the manipulator rotation 
around its axis is ensured by the procession reduction gear. 
This makes it possible to increase the positioning accuracy 
since the manipulator motions are determined by the kinematic 
accuracy of one procession reducer. 
  The use of stepping electric motors is dictated by their 
good 
controllability which eliminates the need for using a sensor 
manipulator element position monitoring system.

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-006C-15C>           Fig. 2. Manipulator's Coordinate Frame of Reference. </FIG>




  It is expedient to use Euler's angles _ps_, _th_, and 
 which 
correspond to each element rotation around the axes of 
revolution in order to determine the manipulator arm position 
and orientation. Each element has a spherical contact surface 
(Fig. 2) and is fixed to the coordinate system of reference of 
the preceding i-1 element of Euler's angles _ps_, _th_, 
 which 
correspond to elementary geometrical rotations around the axes 
OZ[.sup]i[/], OX[.sub]i[/], and OY[.sub]i[/]. 
  The geometrical rotation around point O is characterized by 
the rotation angle _ps_. The transformation matrix in this case 
assumes the form of: 


  This matrix is also referred to as the elementary rotation 
matrix. Likewise, rotation around the OX[.sup]i[/] axis has 
the following rotation matrix: 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-006C-15D>           Equation </FIG>



  The matrix of rotation around the OZ[.sup]i[/] = 
OZ[.sup]i[/] axis is similar to matrix (2): 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-006C-15E>           Equation </FIG>



  The elementary matrix of rotation around the OY[.sup]i1[/] 
matrix is expressed as 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-006C-15F>           Equation </FIG>



  Having obtained elementary rotation matrices, one can obtain 
the transformation matrix R, which is also referred to as the 
rotation matrix or transition probability matrix. For an 
orthogonal initial system of coordinates, we obtain the 
following dependence: 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-006C-15G>           Equation </FIG>



  Dependence (6) corresponds to elementary rotations around 
the 
OZ[.sup]i[/], OX[.sub]i[/], and OZ[.sub]l[/] axes. 
Likewise, one can determine five more combinations of Euler's 
angles which differ from those cited above. 
  Similar computations can be performed for any element i of 
the flexible manipulator. 
  Consequently, the manipulator gripper position can be 
analytically described and programmed at any moment in time and 
at any point in the service area. This significantly simplifies 
the manipulator control system. 
  For existing ``elephant trunk'' manipulators, the proposed 
design is the simplest and has the best quality indicators. 
  The manipulator positioning accuracy can be increased by 
decreasing the number of actuators and improving the element 
controllability. 
  An analytical description of the current position of any 
manipulator element in space ensures stored-program manipulator 
control.

  [Text] In today's field of robotic systems, the outlook is 
good for developing the facilities and methods of adaptive 
control which make it possible to expand the functional 
capabilities of industrial robots (PR)[.sup][1][/]. 
  One of the promising robotic information facilities 
characterizing the parameters of the perturbing factors are 
sensor systems which are used for sensing computer-aided and 
robotized special-purpose facilities for loading and unloading 
explosive substances and munitions, charging systems, etc. In 
order to move the manipulated entities with a specific force and 
spatial orientation, it is necessary to measure the force vector 
and torque vector operating between the gripper and the gripped 
entity with the help of a force/torque sensor of the sensory 
system. 
  By equipping a robotic facility with a sensory system, one 
can plot the force control loop and utilize the principles of 
positional-force control which expands the functional 
capabilities of the robotic systems. 
  Traditional force measurement methods involve determining 
force through elastic deformation[.sup][2][/]. This principle 
underlines the operation of an overwhelming majority of 
facilities used for this purpose. 
  It is expedient to employ sensory grippers in addressing the 
issues of force measurement in industrial robots specialized in 
precision operations. 
  In known sensory industrial robot systems, the sensing 
(force 
measurement) function is performed by a resistance strain gauge 
matched with an elastic element. These devices contain the 
following components: a modulator-demodulator (MDM) amplifier, a 
direct current amplifier with a low-pass filter, a regulated 
power supply source, an analog-to-digital converter (ATsP), and 
an interface with a communication line[.sup][3][/]. 
  Yet these devices have a number of shortcomings: the 
complexity of structural implementation which does not make it 
possible to integrate the industrial robot's analog-to-digital 
converter and the data transmission device in the gripper and 
the placement of a preamplifier inside the industrial robot 
sensor. Data on the force in the gripper picked up from the 
resistance strain gauges is transmitted in the form of voltage 
or current to a remote analog-to-digital converter which 
performs the functions of converting the analog signal into a 
digital form and processing data on a computer. 
  Such devices are characterized by one significant 
shortcoming 
of analog technology--their low noise immunity and accuracy. 
  The gripper sensing device is executed as a fluidic 
instrument element located on the housing between the jaws while 
the output channel of this element is connected to elastic 
chambers through a comparison element whereby each chamber is 
linked to one of the fluidic elements. The chambers, in turn, 
are connected to the power supply through a regulator. Yet even 
this device has many drawbacks; a large number of pneumatic 
channels with local drag; and partial sensing (at the part and 
chamber gripping location). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-006C-17A>           Fig. 1. Gripper </FIG>




  The industrial robot sensory gripper (Fig. 1) contains 
housing 1 with jaws 2, elastic elements 3 with resistance strain 
gauges 4, and interface module 5 with an n-channel line. 
  A total of n resistance-to-time-interval converters whose 
inputs are connected to strain gauge resistance whereby the 
outputs of the resistance-to-time-interval converters are linked 
to an interface with an n-channel communication line is added to 
the gripper which contains jaws, elastic elements closely tied 
to the jaws, resistance strain gauges attached to elastic 
elements, and interfaces with the n-channel communication line. 
  The addition of n converters whose inputs are connected to 
resistors makes it possible to increase the fullness of the 
information content value and noise immunity in transmitting 
data on the value of the forces and torques developing in the 
gripper and structurally to integrate in the gripper the 
analog-to-digital converter and the data transmission device by 
increasing the gauge factor of the strain gauge and current 
coupling between data transmitting and receiving devices. It was 
possible to simplify the design and increase the gripper 
reliability due to the fact that the sensory device is executed 
as elastic elements with resistance strain gauges attached to 
them and an interface module with an n-channel communication 
line and n resistance-to-time-interval converters whose inputs 
are connected to the outputs of resistance strain gauges whereby 
the converter outputs are connected to the n-channel 
communication line of the module. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-006C-17B>           Fig. 2. Expansion of Force and Torque </FIG>




  A rectangular system of coordinates which demonstrates the 
expansion of the vector of force and torque applied to the 
gripper jaw is shown in Fig. 2. 
  Any unit force or torque applied to the gripper may be 
represented as follows with respect to any point on the jaw 
extremity: 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-006C-17C>           Equation </FIG>

  F = (F[.sup]x[/], F[.sub]y[/], 
F[.sup]z[/], M[.sub]x[/], M[.sub]y[/], M[.sub]z[/]). 
  During the gripper operation, the external force and moment 
may be applied to the jaws in any direction. Elastic element 3 
(see Fig. 1) is sensitive in the bending direction and is stable 
in all other directions, so that the resistance of each other 
resistance strain gauges changes insignificantly. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-006C-17D>           Fig. 3. Block Diagram of the </FIG>




  A block diagram of stress conversion from the force and 
moment components executed with the help of the gripper is shown 
in Fig. 3, while a circuit diagram of one of the conversion and 
data transmission channels from one of the force or moment 
components is shown in Fig. 4 where 1 is the 
resistance-to-time-interval converter, 2 is the resistance 
strain gauge, 3 is a capacitor, 4 is a univibrator, 5 is the 
converter input, and 6 is the interface circuit with the 
communication line. 
  The resistance strain gauge is an integral part of the 
resistance-to-time-interval converter. It is a primary 
conversion element which transform a mechanical quantity into an 
electric signal in the form of resistance R[.sup]FM[/]. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-006C-18A>           Fig. 4. Circuit Diagram of the Data </FIG>




  Semiconductor KDT-2B silicon resistance strain gauges which 
meet the specifications of AO.336235 TU and have a 220 O 
resistance and a length of 2 or 7 mm are used as primary 
transducers. The resistance strain gauges are glued to the 
measuring surface of the elastic element with a VL-931 lacquer 
(GOST 10402-75). Slices of the FDM-1 material with a 0.2-mm 
thickness (TU 16-503.084-71) are glued to the measuring spots of 
the elastic element. The terminal wires are glued to the slices 
in order to protect the resistance strain gauge from possible 
ruptures. The resistance strain gauges, soldering spots, and the 
wires are covered with the VL-931 lacquer (GOST 10462-75). 
  Together with resistance strain gauge 2, capacitor 3 with a 
capacitance of C forms a controlled RC-circuit with a time 
constant of _t_ = R[.sup]FM[/]C. The time constant value _t_ 
determines the length of the T-pulse generated by the 
univibrator. 
  The device operates in the following fashion. A force is 
applied to the jaws in any direction when the part is being 
gripped. In this case, the elastic element is deformed under the 
effect of this force. The stresses developing in it are picked 
up by resistance strain gauges whose resistance is proportionate 
to the elastic element tension at the place of its installation. 
After converting the mechanical quantity into electric in the 
form of resistance R[.sup]FM[/], the capacitor in the 
interface module of resistance strain gauge 2 converts 
resistance to the time constant _t_ which determines the 
duration of the T-pulse generated by univibrator 4. 
  The duration of the voltage pulse at the univibrator output 
as well as the current pulse in the communication line contain 
data on the force or moment which are expressed by the following 
formula: 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-006C-18B>           Equation </FIG>

  T = K_t_ = KR[.sup]FM[/]C = KC(A + BF), 
  where K is the conversion ratio of univibrator 4 and A and B 
are the coefficients determined by the physical parameters of 
resistance strain gauge 2. 
  The current magnitude in the communication line is important 
only for the data transmission noise immunity indicators and 
does not affect the contents of this information. 
  Compared to the sensors described in [2,3] which perform the 
force measurement function, the proposed device has the 
following advantages. Foil-type resistance strain gauges are 
used as primary transducers which greatly limits the maximum 
attainable output signal magnitude (the gauge factor of the 
foil-resistance strain gauges is K = (_D_ R/R)/(_D_ 1/1)=2-3 
whereas the same figure for semiconductor devices is K = 
100-200). 
  The advantages of the force/torque systems described in [3] 
are realized provided that high-quality amplifiers are used. 
  Furthermore, the output voltage after primary conversion is 
very low, so its transmission and processing may be very 
complicated in the presence of electromagnetic interference. 
This factor often calls for placing a preamplifier inside the 
sensor. 
  Due to the use of semiconductor resistance as primary 
transducers in the aforementioned device, the output signal 
level is measured in units of volts (1-5 V) whereby it is not 
necessary to use amplifiers or preamplifiers. 
  The semiconductor resistance strain gauges' high sensitivity 
and the use of resistance-to-time-interval converters ensure 
small overall dimensions of the sensor and electronic module 
structure. This, in turn, makes it possible to install them 
directly on the gripper jaws or integrate them as a single 
device with the jaws. 
  Given a pulse data representation and transmission in a 
pulse 
form, the noise immunity indicators, compared to those of 
continuous representation, are much higher. 
  The current feedback between the data transmission and 
reception devices also ensures a more stable noise immunity 
compared to voltage feedback since based on experimental data, 
the current feedback even after attaining a 100-200 mA current 
becomes a source of noise (in this case, the output signal 
values reach 3-20 mA). 
  An increase in noise immunity is the determining factor of 
reliable industrial robot performance under extreme operating 
conditions; moreover, data transmission accuracy increases too.

  [Abstract] A computation experiment was carried out for 
retrieving geopotential and temperature by the Abelian inversion 
method using meteorological field series from the data archives 
of the ECHAM global model of general circulation of the 
atmosphere. Numerical simulation was carried out for the 
geopotential, temperature and humidity fields stipulated in a 
standard Gaussian grid with a horizontal resolution 1.125 
and with a vertical resolution of 19 levels in the altitude 
range from the surface to 35 km. An algorithm for solution of 
this problem is given. Results are presented for the 
distribution of the altitude of the 200-mbar surface and the 
error in its retrieval, as well as the temperature distribution 
at this level and the error in its retrieval. It is shown that 
the error in retrieving potential and temperature by the Abelian 
inversion method is greater where the horizontal nonuniformity 
of meteorological fields is greater. The maximum errors are 
about 30 m for geopotential and about 1 K for temperature. These 
errors indicate the possibility of using these data in weather 
and climate prediction problems. Program packages make it 
possible to proceed to the next step: numerical simulation of 
assimilation of the retrieved (with errors) geopotential and 
temperature fields in a model of general circulation of the 
atmosphere for the purpose of investigating the influence of 
retrieval errors on the prediction of meteorological fields.

  [Abstract] Conceptual aspects of the Global Climate 
Observing System, approved by the Eleventh Congress of the World 
Meteorological Organization, are analyzed. Opinions are 
expressed on the need for better substantiation of priorities in 
reserach on global climate change. The author quarrels with the 
subjects assigned to the working groups, as they do not reflect 
top prioirty problems and questions which should be addressed. 
The author believes that conventional and space observation 
facilities have not been combined in a way that achieves 
optimum effectiveness. It is pointed out that the list of 
existing satellite systems for environmental research is 
incomplete. Top priority studies of the atmosphere are 
described. Existing facilities and programs to study the 
atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and land surface are discussed. 
The author charges that there has been insufficient 
consideration of the types of data and data series needed to 
study global climate change. Areas where more studies are 
needed, i.e., the global radiation balance, vegetation cover 
dynamics, interaction of atmosphere and ocean, etc., are 
described. References 32: 15 Russian, 17 Western.

  [Abstract] A theoretical investigation was made of 
two-dimensional harmonic packets of internal waves (IW) in an 
ideal exponentially stratified fluid. With the neglecting of the 
Boussinesq approximation a study was made of the reflection of 
monochromatic packets of internal waves from a rigid plane 
surface. The problem is solved in a Cartesian coordinate system 
with application of the phase portraits method. The phase 
portraits for different cases are examined in detail. Neglecting 
of the Boussinesq approximation results in the appearance of new 
effects, especially with glancing angles of incidence on the 
plane. If the plane is situated beneath an incident packet, in 
addition to an ordinary reflected packet a packet appears which 
transports energy in a direction opposite that of the incident 
packet. However, if the plane is situated beneath an incident 
packet a packet appears which transports energy in the same 
direction as the incident packet, which results in a change in 
the configuration of the incident packet. The envelopes of 
incident and reflected packets are illustrated and discussed.

current, high-gradient envelopes arising on the boundary of the 
density wake and in the wakes behind eddies are important 
structural elements of a current. The rules for identification 
of eddy current elements are formulated and the following types 
of vortical systems are discriminated: small-scale eddies 
localized in a high-gradient envelope, eddies submerged in a 
density wake and so-called hanging eddies. The dependencies of 
their geometric characteristics on the current parameters are 
determined. A new class of instability is defined: structural 
(microscale) instability when a complex relief of the horizontal 
isopycnic surfaces is observed against a background of a smooth 
velocity distribution. Fourteen characteristic types of 
structures are discriminated and a map of current systems is 
plotted. It is shown that on the (lgRe, lgFr[.sup]i[/]) plane 
the boundaries between systems are segments of straight lines.

  [Abstract] Disturbances introduced into a multilayer flow 
of an ideal incompressible heavy fluid by a point source are 
examined. The fluid has a finite number of layers and an 
arbitrary velocity and density distribution in each layer, but 
in the case of a fluid of finite depth it is assumed that the 
lower infinitely deep layer has a constant velocity and density. 
The field of disturbances is represented in the form of a double 
integral of the Green's function of the auxiliary spectral 
problem for an ordinary differential equation dependent on two 
complex parameters. In the case of a fluid of finite depth the 
properties of the discrete spectrum of this problem make it 
possible to represent wave and nonwave disturbances in the form 
of a series of single integrals. In the case of a fluid of 
infinite depth the properties of the discrete and continuous 
spectra of the auxiliary spectral problem make it possible, by 
virtue of the smallness of the stratification parameter, to 
represent the field of disturbances in the form of wave 
disturbances having the form of an infinite sum of the single 
integrals and nonwave disturbances in the form of a double 
integral. The special case of two layers of a constant density 
with an infinitely deep lower layer is investigated. References

  [Abstract] The integral characteristics of the field of 
internal waves generated by rapidly moving bodies in fluids with 
different stratifications can be evaluated without full solution 
of the problems involved in flow around bodies. The following 
aspects of the problem are examined: wave losses for uniformly 
horizontally moving bodies; waves at surface of homogeneous 
fluid and at interface of two fluids; waves in homogeneously 
stratified unbounded fluid; internal waves in stratified 
waveguide with horizontal boundaries. The high-velocity 
asymptotic form of wave resistance is of the power-law type with 
respect to velocity (resistance is inversely proportional to the 
square of the Froude number), other than for the case of 
movement in the maximum stratification zone and at a great 
distance from it in a deep fluid. In the first case (such as 
during movement of a fluid along the surface, through the 
density jump and in a uniformly stratified unbounded fluid) a 
logarithmic dependence on the Froude number is added. In the 
latter case it becomes exponential. The method used also is 
applicable for other wave types. With respect to the 
distribution of radiated energy by different modes, an analysis 
indicates a slowness of dropoff of the contributions with an 
increase in the mode number in situations close to homogeneous 
stratification. With a sufficiently strong localization of 
stratification only the lowest modes can be significantly 
generated. References 5: 3 Russian, 2 Western.

  [Abstract] The results of numerical solution by the hybrid 
finite elements method (FEM) of the linear stationary problem of 
uniform flow around a horizontal cylinder situated beneath the 
pycnocline are presented. The FEM can be used for bodies of a 
complex configuration or system of bodies, but also is 
applicable to the case of a stratified fluid in which density 
change occurs only at horizons situated above a submerged body. 
In all the cases considered here the submerged body is 
positioned completely in the lower layer with an infinite depth. 
Two- and three-layer stratification models corresponding to 
sharp and smooth pycnoclines are examined. The flow direction is 
perpendicular to the cylinder axis. A sharply expressed 
pycnocline is simulated by a two- layer fluid; a smooth 
pycnocline is simulated by a three-layer fluid with a linearly 
stratified middle layer and homogeneous upper and lower layers. 
It is demonstrated in the example of an elliptical cylinder that 
stratification exerts a substantial influence on all the 
hydrodynamic characteristics (wave resistance, lift and 
momentum) in definite velocity ranges. A comparison with an 
approximate analytic solution suitable for a deeply submerged 
body is given. Figures 6; references 14: 9 Russian, 5 Western.

  [Abstract] The existence of vertically spaced local maxima 
of the Brunt-Vaisala frequency N(z), playing the role of 
waveguides for IW, usually leads to the appearance of anomalous 
frequency dispersions (AFD). This problem is examined using data 
for a region of the Atlantic to the northwest of Great Britain 
where the upper waveguide corresponds to the seasonal pycnocline 
and the lower waveguide to the principal pycnocline. The 
existence of several pycnoclines and extended layers with 
quasiconstant N(z) values is characteristic of the North 
Atlantic, Indian Ocean and Black Sea. An anomalous frequency 
dispersion of IW is expressed in the appearance of local extrema 
of group velocities in the range of relatively large wave 
numbers. This is attributable to the characteristics of vertical 
density stratification in the ocean. The characteristics of such 
dispersion in an ocean with several pycnoclines are examined. 
Its influence on the vertical structure, evolution and 
generation of wave fields is analyzed. Manifestations of the 
anomalous frequency dispersion of internal waves in real wave 
processes are discussed. Among the aspects of the problem 
examined are: energy exchange between waveguides, BKW 
approximation for internal waves in ocean with two pycnoclines; 
cluster character of dispersion; Airy wave packets; IW 
generation. Figures 6; references 23: 21 Russian, 2 Western.

  [Abstract] Hydrothermal activity and manifestations of 
ferromanganese ore deposition were studied in the region of the 
juncture of the southern segment of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge with 
a fault zone at 1520'N (Cape Verde fault). A diagram of the 
work region is given showing two intersections of the rift zone 
of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge by the Akademik Nikolay Strakhov 
research ship. Along these intersections samples were taken 
which revealed significant changes in Fe-Mn encrustations. This 
zone is characterized by the presence of traces of hydrothermal 
activity, but it varies greatly from place to place. It is clear 
that anomalies in the composition of Fe-Mn deposits can be used 
in detecting endogenous activity on the ocean floor, but the 
problem of the reasons for these anomalies is more complex. In 
discussing this problem it is noted that in contrast to iron, 
much of which is removed from the geochemical cycle due to the 
formation of insoluble sulfides, the cycling of Mn in the ocean 
is much different. It does not form insoluble minerals but 
passes into solution and reenters sea water. Most of the Mn 
bound in Fe-Mn deposits was regenerated from ancient sedimentary 
deposits. This is attributable to the fact that any 
tectonomagmatic events on the ocean floor, from local 
manifestations of volcanism, spreading and subduction to global 
changes in the position of the continents on the planet, are 
always accompanied by the appearance of reduction conditions 
favoring the migration of earlier deposited manganese. The 
process of oceanic Mn accumulation is unique; it creates a 
background against which not only all events on the ocean floor 
occur, but also against which the maintenance of chemical 
equilibrium in sea water is dependent. The role of oceanic Fe-Mn 
deposits in maintenance of the ecological purity of the planet 
is comparable to the role of forests on the land. A study of the 
composition of the Fe-Mn deposits not only makes it possible to 
clarify problems involved in ore formation, but also provides 
additional possibilities for characterizing tectonomagmatic 
conditions in active regions on the ocean floor. Figure 1;

Scientific-Production Association] 
  [Text] An interfarm biological laboratory was organized in 
1990 in Leningradskiy Rayon, Krasnodar Kray at the 
Leningradskoye APO [Agricultural Production Association?]. 
Besides producing biological agents, its has been ordered to 
reveal the most dangerous pests and diseases of agricultural 
crops, to draw maps of their occurrence at farms, and to develop 
the methods of effective use of different microbiological 
preparations and monitoring the quality of biological agents 
delivered to the rayon's farms. The Northern Caucasian 
Scientific Research Institute of Phytopathology provided 
technical and methodological assistance to the laboratory in all 
of these years. 
  In the stage of initial development, our main goal was to 
establish a collective of like-minded individuals capable of 
organizing production of biological agents in the shortest time 
possible, and to unite farm agronomists around the idea of 
ecologically compatible plant protection. We believe we were 
able to solve this problem successfully. The biolaboratory, 
which has become part of the Biota Scientific-Production 
Association, currently employs 12 persons, including Doctor of 
Biological Sciences T. S. Ivanova (a nematologist), Candidate of 
Biological Sciences A. P. Luda (a microbiologist), five highly 
qualified specialists with a higher biological and agricultural 
education, and four laboratory technicians. 
  The laboratory has equipment making it possible to produce 
microbiological preparations such as rizoplan, bitoksibatsillin, 
lepidotsid, baktofit, preparation-2 and trichodermin, and 
preparations based on predatory nematodes. 
  The first lots of bacterial and fungal preparations were 
produced in May 1991 according to procedures introduced at the 
SK NIIF [not further identified]. In addition the laboratory's 
associates underwent apprenticeship at the All-Union Scientific 
Research Institute of Applied Microbiology (Obolensk), where 
they mastered the methods of producing and using several 
microbiological preparations. A highly active strain of 
Trichoderma was revealed independently. It is now 
being used in greenhouses of Leningradskiy Rayon to control root 
rot. The laboratory is also developing preparative forms of 
biological resources based on entomopathogenic nematodes that 
are highly effective (70-95 percent) against wireworms and 
potato moths. A total of 7,200 liters of biological preparations 
were produced in 9 months of 1992. 
  During the time that the scientific and practical directions 
of the laboratory's work were forming and it was financed out of 
the budget of the Leningradskoye APO, its activity moved along 
quite briskly. But the situation changed after transition to 
full cost accounting. Difficulties typical of not just our 
enterprise alone came into being. An acute need arose for 
increasing production volume and fitting out the laboratory with 
highly productive equipment (primarily fermenters of different 
capacities), for erecting a separate production building, a 
boiler plant and so on, and for solving a number of public 
health problems. All of this requires considerable resources! 
Realizing the concept of low-volume microbiological production 
will doubtlessly require investors. 
  The problems of supplying laboratories with strains of 
industrial microorganisms satisfying all of the requirements of 
modern production, and of organizing advanced training courses 
for laboratory associates, have not been solved. 
  There is a problem in keeping personnel employed year-round. 
Everyone is busy in spring and summer, but in fall and winter 
the few greenhouse complexes are unable to keep our work 
profitable. We are looking for things for the people to 
do--perhaps producing yeast for food industry, feed additives, 
silage leaven for animal husbandry, and biologically produced 
humus. 
  We would be interested in knowing how other collectives are 
solving these problems.

engineer, Biozar TOO] 
  [Text] Interest in ecological clean microbiological 
preparations that are relatively safe to use has grown in recent 
years both in our country and abroad. According to estimates of 
foreign specialists the market for biopreparations used in plant 
protection has increased annually by 4-5 percent since 1984. The 
outlays of the leading chemical companies of the USA, Great 
Britain, the FRG, Denmark, the Netherlands and Brazil on 
developing the procedures of acquiring biopreparations are from 
2.5 to 12.5 percent of the total expenses of the companies. What 
is significant is that the outlays on developing biopesticides 
are 3-5 times lower than on research and development of chemical 
preparations. We can also add to this the relatively less 
expensive and faster registration of biopreparations ($500,000 
and a testing period of up to 3 years) as compared to chemical 
ones (from $10 million to $20 million and a testing time of up 
to 7 years or more). 
  Besides by ecological problems, development of this 
alternative method of protection is stimulated in Russia and CIS 
countries by the shortage of even chemical pesticides in the 
market. 
  However, analysis of the situation that has established 
itself in the domestic biopreparation market revealed a totally 
unfavorable state of affairs. Development of modern production 
processes for microbiological plant protection resources, 
creation of new biopreparations, improvement of existing ones, 
and the problems of their mass production and use for integrated 
protection of agricultural crops remain behind the needs of 
practice. Much of the research ends right after the producer 
strains are studied, or in the best case it gets as far as 
developing the laboratory procedures of their acquisition. For 
these and a number of other reasons only four out of all of the 
biopreparations recommended for use are presently being produced 
by industry. 
  Current high-volume production of microbiological plant 
protection resources, which is based on subsurface procedures, 
is not adapted to the needs of agriculture because of the 
absence of feedback between consumers and manufacturing plants. 
The possibility of transition to the production of new 
biopreparations, especially those requiring changes in the 
production process, is limited. 
  The idea of organizing regional low-volume operations 
producing microbiological preparations is fully justified not 
only because this makes it possible to create flexible 
all-purpose lines capable of quickly saturating the market with 
new biopreparations, but also from the standpoint of reducing 
the ecological load upon the environment and bringing production 
into the direct proximity of the consumer. At this moment the 
list of microbiological plant protection resources currently 
produced by industry is limited to bacterial preparations with a 
spectrum of action that does not encompass a significant part of 
the most dangerous diseases and pests. Despite the high demand 
for fungal preparations, their industrial production has still 
not been organized. Difficulties arising in organizing their 
industrial production are rooted in the particular features of 
the production process, which includes a stage of solid-phase or 
surface cultivation. 
  In distinction from bacterial preparations, fungal 
preparations may be produced both by subsurface and by 
subsurface-solid phase procedures. In this case the latter is 
preferred because it simulates the natural means of existence 
and reproduction of fungi in nature. But it is precisely for the 
solid-phase stage that equipment is still unavailable. 
Laboratory models of such systems are unsatisfactory when the 
process is scaled up. These are engineering problems, and to 
biologists they are an insurmountable barrier to designing the 
equipment. 
  From our point of view, when we organize production we need 
to shift the accent in the direction of solving the engineering 
problems of providing industrial facilities to support the stage 
of solid-phase cultivation. This approach to the problem is all 
the more necessary because the solid-phase stage exists in 
production processes found in contiguous fields of biotechnology 
(protein enrichment of feed, enzyme production etc.) that are 
experiencing similar difficulties in technical support. 
  An exchange of opinions among specialists on the 
biotechnology of microbiological plant protection resources at 
the latest meeting of the bureau of the plant protection 
division of the Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences (29 
September 1992) confirmed that progress in commercializing 
fungal resources has in fact come to a standstill because of the 
absence of facilities for industrial production. Scientific 
research on creating, testing and producing these preparations 
requires creation of its own aseptic, automated, ecologically 
clean industrial-scale testing stand combining both directions 
of acquisition of fungal preparations--subsurface and 
solid-phase. 
  The first stage of organizing such a stand (a pilot 
facility), and in the future a network of regional small 
enterprises on its basis, requires that we determine the volume 
of fungal biopreparations actually needed by agriculture. This 
will make it possible to substantiate the terms ``regional'' and 
``low-volume'' production not only qualitatively but also 
quantitatively, and to determine the productivity of the pilot 
facility on this basis. 
  From our point of view the problem of providing fungal 
preparations should be considered initially in relation to 
sheltered ground. The range of use of fungal plant protection 
resources in greenhouses is considerable, and it will grow in 
the future. In order to determine the possible market we need to 
consider the actual distribution of greenhouse complexes, their 
area, the transportation systems and the possible contributions 
by farms to production development, and strive to maintain an 
antimonopoly policy and ecological safety of land adjacent to 
the enterprise. 
  The CIS countries presently have around 5,000 ha under glass 
and 11,000 ha under film, with around 6,600 of these hectares 
being in nursery greenhouses (in Russia there are around 2,000 
ha of glass greenhouses in 137 sovkhozes and 11 kolkhozes). In 
this case the concentration of greenhouse area is extremely 
nonuniform in different regions of CIS countries: For example 
over 250 ha are scattered among farms in the form of greenhouses 
with an area less than 3 ha, while on the other hand around 400 
ha are concentrated in the Moscow vicinity, and in Stavropol 
Kray, the single Yuzhniy Sovkhoz has an area of 144 ha. 
  If we orient ourselves on production of biopreparations 
already permitted for use (trichodermin, boverin and 
verticillin), and consider the accumulated experience of their 
use and the actual distribution of sheltered ground area, the 
following productivity of an industrial-scale stand would be the 
most suitable: for trichodermin preparation--66,000 kg, for 
boverin concentrate--4,000 kg, for verticillin 
concentrate--2,400 kg per year. 
  These figures make it possible to tentatively estimate the 
quantity of regional low-volume production operations. In Moscow 
oblast for example, which has a sheltered ground area of around 
400 ha, two facilities producing trichodermin, one facility 
producing boverin and three facilities producing verticillin 
need to be established. Given the designated productivity, a 
minimum of three facilities producing different preparations 
will have to be established in each of the oblasts possessing 
the largest area of sheltered ground. On the whole, the 
tentative number of facilities for vegetable greenhouses, 
including film and nursery, will be 157. 
  However, it is impossible to consider series production of 
facilities of this type right away. There are a number of causes 
retarding organization of production: The results of fundamental 
research are insufficient to permit establishment of the initial 
requirements on equipment for the production processes; the list 
of equipment available for solid-phase cultivation is limited; 
there are few enterprises capable of producing nonstandard 
equipment; the procedure of using biopreparations has not been 
perfected. Therefore we need to gather together all of our 
knowledge and create at least one ``pioneer'' pilot facility. 
This will not only concentrate the results of scientific 
research but also reveal those design offices and plants that 
will be able to continue this work. Moreover in addition to 
engaging in scientific activity associated with introducing new 
production processes, a scientific and technical center 
established on the basis of this first facility will also 
involve itself in producing and distributing biopreparations in 
the season of their use, this bringing in financial resources to 
partially support itself. 
  Work on new equipment foresees evaluating the shortcomings 
and merits of developments of previous years. Enzyme industry 
studied the issue of creating instruments for the solid-phase 
cultivation stage seriously and deeply back in the 1960s-1970s 
using, as its initial models, highly productive equipment 
created in the chemical sector of industry. In the final stages 
of the work it gradually became overwhelmed by a large quantity 
of diverse attachments, mechanisms, devices and life-support 
systems, which had a negative effect on acquisition of high 
concentrations of the target product. This forced them to 
abandon the solid-phase method of cultivation at the production 
scale and switch to the subsurface method, which permits more 
effective control of the production process and use of 
previously created standard equipment. It is now recognized that 
this approach failed to justify itself in application to fungal 
preparations, and a return to the solid-phase method of their 
acquisition is occurring abroad. Consequently we need to offer 
the corresponding equipment to practical workers in the new 
stage of technical development. 
  However, while the problems of organizing subsurface 
production have been studied sufficiently well, it is difficult 
to trust the results of developing industrial procedures of 
solid-phase cultivation because not enough research has been 
carried out on heat and mass exchange in the fermentation 
process. In the meantime it is precisely the hydrodynamic and 
the heat and mass exchange processes that do not yield to 
upscaling by extrapolation, and require modeling in real 
conditions. And this is something a pilot facility would be able 
to do. 
  Analysis of existing technical concepts and of the priority 
directions of designing equipment permits us to adopt, as our 
basis, a continuous production process based on production lines 
built according to the modular unit principle. According to this 
principle the structure of a line is formed out of separate 
modules of particular output dependent upon the output of the 
facility as a whole. The modules are interlinked on the basis of 
material flows. This principle makes it possible to reduce time 
outlays, resetting the equipment is simplified, and the 
preconditions are created for raising the level of automation, 
unification and standardization of particular modules, units and 
the facility as a whole. 
  We proposed a general plan for a pilot facility producing 
fungal pesticides on a modular unit basis. This single facility 
brings together a number of technical concepts qualifying as 
inventions, beginning with electrically driven containerized 
pipeline transport, electrophysical methods of sterilizing the 
material flows and the airtight circuit, and use of an aerosol 
working medium in the air conditioning system to support heat 
and mass exchange during fermentation, and ending with 
electrolytic liquid waste treatment. 
  Research ordered by the Giproniselprom [not further 
identified] (Orel) was conducted by the VNIIbiotekhnologiya 
[All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Biotechnology] 
(Moscow) to create the above-described pilot facility for 
subsurface-sold phase cultivation of fungal pesticides. The 
initial requirements on developing production lines were 
prepared and technical concepts were developed on the basis of 
these requirements as a result. 
  The complex of scientific research and experimental design 
work carried out by us (Giproniselprom, VNIIbiotekhnologiya and 
other institutes) in 1988-1990 and the practical experience of 
the Biozar Enterprise, established at the Belaya Dacha Sovkhoz, 
demonstrated the solvency of the decisions. 
  However, unique experimental research and implementation of 
these decisions were halted because of the absence of financing. 
It would be desirable to continue the work, before the 
researchers move on to other forms of activity. Steps must be 
taken to finish working up the program as quickly as possible, 
and to coordinate its individual sections associated with 
development of different directions of biological protection. 
  Creation of complex biological production equipment will 
require the joint efforts of specialists in different sectors of 
science and industry. The daily grind of organizing research, 
financing and planning, and bringing the results together into a 
single system must go on. Such work cannot be done in breaks 
between principal activities; it must be carried out by a 
collective of like-minded individuals, since otherwise it would 
be difficult to count on the anticipated effect of development 
as a whole. But under our system the situation is promoting not 
consolidation but disintegration of creative collectives, and 
namely because of the absence of financing. 
  State programs on biotechnology have been adopted in all 
developed countries, chiefly because the practice of financing 
large problems by private companies has not justified itself. 
Private clients are interested, after all, in a quick return 
from realization of a project. And this is not always possible, 
especially in the case of long-term programs. Greenhouse 
complexes in Russia and other CIS countries, which are potential 
orderers of biological resources, are unable to pay for large 
scientific developments in the situation as it is today. The one 
thing they can do is fund construction of facilities, and even 
so, not always. 
  The exploratory nature of future scientific research and 
experimental design work presupposes the need for state 
financing.

  [Text] The problem of organizing low-volume regional 
operations producing microbiological preparations within the 
state agricultural service is now being broadly discussed among 
specialists. We asked V. P. Filatov, chief of the biological 
methods subdivision of the Russian Agricultural Production 
Ministry's Plant Protection Administration, to describe the 
means by which this administration plans to solve the 
problem. 
  FomenkoVladimir Petrovich, what compelled the 
Plant Protection Administration to address the idea of 
organizing low-volume regional production operations? 
  FilatovTwenty-five biological agents can now be 
used to protect agricultural crops in greenhouses--12 useful 
insects and 12-15 biopreparations. New, highly effective 
developments exist which require extensive testing under 
production conditions. Possessing such a huge potential, we 
could significantly increase the role played by the biological 
method on open and especially on sheltered ground. However, our 
high-volume ``giants''--the plants of microbiological 
industry--are extremely sluggish. Their production continues to 
revolve around a few bacterial preparations coming in imperfect 
preparative forms. The plants never did get into producing 
fungal preparations. Nor are they willing to produce small, 
so-called low-volume lots--that would be unprofitable. To make 
matters worse, the plants supply their products to agriculture 
in the third and fourth quarters, forcing the farms to store 
biopreparations locally until the following summer. All of this 
brings out uneasiness and a mistrust of the manufacturer, the 
preparations and the biological method as a whole. 
  Considering the many years of practical work with the 
plants, 
and their slowness in making use of scientific developments, we 
were forced to create biofactories and biolaboratories within 
the plant protection system, which began producing a broader 
assortment of biological resources in direct proximity to the 
consumer. Life has confirmed the correctness of the selected 
path. All that has been done to introduce the biological method 
in recent years is a credit to it. However, time is marching on, 
and laboratory procedures remain at a primitive level--jars, 
rockers, cans, etc. As an example, production of baktorodentsid 
requires ``babying'' it manually 10-15 times. The quality of the 
products is unstable. Nor are the biolaboratories always able to 
produce the needed volume, especially if the preparation is new 
and effective, and if the demand for it is snowballing. 
  There is but one solution--we need to have our own 
low-volume 
production operations, ones established on the basis of 
equipment similar to that used in industry. 
  FomenkoWhat has been done already in this 
direction? 
  FilatovThe Russian Ministry of Agricultural 
Production has allocated the money, and it has found a certain 
defense industry enterprise to manufacture the needed equipment. 
We went there in August 1992 together with specialists--process 
engineers and microbiologists--and contracted for the creation 
of five facilities producing bacterial and fungal preparations 
in the form of pastes rather than dry powders. First of all, 
pastes have a shelf life of up to 6 months, which is fully 
sufficient considering the mobility of production and its 
proximity to the client. Second, this form is applied more 
easily--it doesn't create dust, and it doesn't clog sprayers. 
Third, paste preparations will be 40 percent cheaper than dry 
ones. Moreover their effectiveness is usually 10-15 percent 
higher. 
  FomenkoWhat does the set of equipment possessed by 
such facilities include? 
  FilatovA steam generator, a compressor, coarse and 
fine cleaning filters, 10, 100 and 1,000 liter fermenters, a 
separator and a filtering unit to concentrate the product. 
  FomenkoWhat preparations have you decided to 
produce in the first stage? 
  FilatovWe have an extremely great need for aktinin 
to control the spider mite, ampelomitsin, boverin of various 
strains, trichodermin of various strains, nematofagin, 
mikoafidin, piromorfin, fitolavin and rizoplan. The last 
preparation, by the way, is needed in large volumes, and one of 
our facilities will be able to produce up to 700 kg of rizoplan 
daily. We will also produce pentofag and baktorodentsid. We plan 
to introduce the procedures of producing lepidotsid, 
bitoksibatsillin, gomelin and dendrobatsillin in paste form. 
  FomenkoWhen will these facilities be ready? 
  FilatovThe manufacturing plant is to turn them 
over fully ready for use in March 1993. It will provide 
guaranteed repairs and service for a year. 
  FomenkoWhere are they to be located? 
  FilatovIn the most ``needy'' places: in the health 
resort zone of the city of Bolshiye Sochi, and in Krasnodar, 
Voronezh, Kirov and Yoshkar-Ola, to perfect the procedures and 
debug the equipment. 
  FomenkoWill specially adapted premises and 
buildings be needed for them? 
  FilatovThe set of equipment can be located in an 
area of 30 m[.sup]2[/], and its height will not exceed 2 
meters. Suitable space will probably be found at the plant 
protection stations. There is only one important condition that 
must be observed: A supply of up to 100 kW of electric power. 
  FomenkoWho will work at these plants, where are 
you going to get the specialists? 
  FilatovThere are microbiologists in our service 
that could take on this job. Moreover we have reached agreement 
with workers of the Omutninsk Plant to organize courses for our 
specialists in which they could learn the procedures of working 
with the new facilities. 
  FomenkoHow will the production volume and 
assortment of preparations be determined? 
  FilatovThe low-volume production operations need 
to seek customers themselves. Anyway, in this stage they won't 
need to seek them--they are already known. First, we have 
greenhouse complexes, kolkhozes, sovkhozes, commercial farms, 
and storehouses in which products are processed before storage. 
Also, we are doing little to satisfy the demand of clients in 
the private sector, the army of which is growing, and which has 
always been and will always be interested in ecologically clean 
products and safe plant protection resources. That is, the range 
of our customers is very wide. 
  Unfortunately we are doing little to provide publicity and 
information on biopreparations. Agronomists need to know, for 
example, that the Colorado beetle could be fought not only with 
the preparation detsis, but also bitoksibatsillin, and the 
effective preparation detsimid; there are plans for carrying out 
field tests with the new preparation Colorado. If we sit down 
and think about it, we already have five effective 
microbiological resources for controlling these pests that are 
in no way inferior to chemical ones. Once they learn about them, 
the demand will doubtlessly grow. 
  FomenkoVladimir Petrovich, considering the known 
demand for biopreparations, how do you feel, how many facilities 
will be needed, in an oblast for example? 
  FilatovA single facility wouldn't of course solve 
the problem in some southern oblasts, two or three would be 
needed. Moreover in our planning work we foresaw the possibility 
of increasing their productivity by 2-3 times. This ``reserve'' 
is present in all of the machine units--in those delivering 
steam and air, and in filtering units. Just add another 
fermenter, and the possibilities will widen significantly. 
  FomenkoThe first five facilities will be 
practically given away to Krasnodar, Sochi, Kirov and other 
cities. What if other oblasts would want to have the same kind 
of equipment? Will they have to buy it? 
  FilatovYes, they will have to buy it. 
  FomenkoHow much does one such set cost? 
  FilatovIt's no secret: We signed a contract with 
manufacturing plant for five facilities for a total of 32 
million rubles. 
  FomenkoWill clients have to apply directly to the 
plant, or would it be more advantageous to work through the 
Plant Protection Administration? 
  FilatovI wouldn't want this to be done directly 
through the plant. Here is why. It would of course be profitable 
for the plant, because it is looking for work. But we would like 
to perfect the production operation, to teach people, to check 
out everything and achieve maximum reliability ourselves for the 
time being, within the plant protection service, with our own 
specialists. After all, the equipment has to work without 
interruption for more than just a single year. The plant is not 
going to become involved in training personnel and tailoring the 
instruments to each client. After we get all of the bugs out, 
let potential clients visit us, see the facilities in operation, 
and they can decide for themselves whether they want to acquire 
the equipment. 
  FomenkoIf everything goes according to plan, will 
high-volume microbiological production operations become 
unnecessary? 
  FilatovNo. Plants of microbiological industry will 
continue to produce large of lots of preparations--over 500 
tonnes. They won't lose any clients if the quality of their 
products is high and if they are convenient to use. All the more 
so because microbiological resources are now becoming 
competitive with chemical ones both in price and in 
effectiveness, while in terms of ecological safety they are far 
superior. 
  FomenkoWhat is your attitude toward the numerous 
cooperatives and small enterprises outside the plant protection 
service that have now begun producing microbiological 
preparations? 
  FilatovIt is fully positive, though at the same 
time cautious. Because production and use of biopreparations by 
nonspecialists who violate the procedures may result in woeful 
consequences. The Russian Ministry of Agricultural Production 
and the Ministry of Health have even prepared a special document 
calling for the prohibition of unregulated production of fungal 
and bacterial resources. Please understand me correctly: We do 
not fear competition with any other producers. The more 
preparations that are produced, the better. The only thing is 
that the producer must have all of the necessary documents, the 
technical conditions and regulations must be observed, and 
emblems of quality and guarantees must be present. Then there 
wouldn't be any problems.
