<F P=106> [Article by Academician-Secretary V. A. Zakharenko, </F>
plant protection division, RASKhN: ``Under Discussion in the 
Russian Academy''] 
  [Text] In light of the abrupt decline in industrial 
production of pesticides and microbiological plant protection 
resources, the plant protection division of the RASKhN [Russian 
Academy of Agricultural Sciences] raised the question ``On the 
Status, Prospects for Development and Organization of Low-Volume 
Regional Production of Microbiological Plant Protection 
Resources'' before the bureau and the presidium of the RASKhN. 
It was discussed thoroughly on 28 September and 15 October 1992 
respectively. 
  Organizing regional production of microbiological resources 
for Russia is important in connection with the departure of the 
Progress Plant (Kazakhstan), the Zaporozhye and Novgorod-Volyn 
(Ukraine) and Ungeny (Moldova) plants, and some scientific 
research institutions--the VNIIBMZR [All-Union Scientific 
Research Institute for the Biological Method of Plant 
Protection] (Moldova), and the VNIIGINTOKS [All-Union Scientific 
Research Institute of Hygiene and Toxins] and the Biotekhnika 
VNIITs [All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Ecology 
Center] (Ukraine)--to other sovereign states, resulting in a 
worsening of scientific support and deliveries of 
biopreparations. Given an annual demand of 35,000-40,000 tonnes, 
Russian agriculture receives 10,000 tonnes from biological 
plants and laboratories and uses biopreparations over an area 
5.5-6 million ha, corrected to a single application per ha--that 
is, only around 5 percent of the area of plowland and perennial 
plantations. 
  Under the conditions of a market economy, in the absence of 
proper consideration of natural and economic conditions and the 
health of plants on agricultural land, the monopoly on 
industrial production of biopreparations has been found to be 
insufficiently effective. Difficulties in determining marketing 
strategy and studying the demand for biopreparations resulted in 
the fact that even with extremely low production volumes, unsold 
biopreparations that are losing their potency have accumulated 
at warehouses of Russia's sole plant in Berd, and at warehouses 
of the Selkhozkhimiya Association. 
  The noted shortcomings of monopolistic, large-scale 
industrial production could be surmounted by combining it with 
more-flexible regional production adapted to local conditions 
and producing in low volumes. The concept of such production was 
developed by scientists of the Russian Agricultural Academy, the 
Ministry of Agricultural Production, the Russian Ministry of 
Health and specialists of the GKNT [State Committee for Science 
and Technology]. The planning and establishment of low-volume 
production on standard equipment using standard procedures in 
industrial-type biological enterprises is proposed by this 
concept. 
  The scientific and organizational groundwork for reaching 
these objective has been laid in Russia. 
  1. Scientific institutions working in the field of plant 
protection have developed new, promising preparations 
corresponding to or exceeding the best foreign analogues in 
their effectiveness, and the technical conditions of their 
production and use were developed on the basis of the results of 
research carried out within the framework of the 
``Biopesticide'' project of the GNTP [State Scientific-Technical 
Program?] ``Agricultural Production Processes of the Future,'' 
and within the framework of fundamental and priority applied 
programs. For example jointly with other organizations the VIZR 
developed mikoafidin T, entoks, afidol, verticillin M and 
aleytsid, which are highly effective in protecting plants from 
aphids, the spider mite and whiteflies; alerin B and C for 
protection against agents of root rot, blight, fuserial head 
blight and powdery mildew. These preparations have no analogues 
in world plant protection practice. 
  2. Original procedures have been developed for making fungal 
preparations--boverin, verticillin, trichodermin and rizoplan, 
bacterial preparations based on Bacillus turingiensis 
baktorodentsid, and viral preparations. Production procedures 
have been introduced in biological production laboratories. In 
particular, trichodermin is being produced by 90 laboratories, 
verticillin by 35, and boverin by 5 with a production volume of 
up to 5 tonnes. However, the absence of equipment is reducing 
the quality of the procedures for producing the biopreparations. 
  3. Experimental industrial production of practically all 
known means of obtaining biopreparations (subsurface, 
surface-subsurface, surface) on standard equipment at pilot 
plants using progressive procedures is being perfected. 
Production of metabolite preparations is being organized at the 
Etoks Experimental Production Enterprise (St. Petersburg), 
production of the biopreparations alerin B and alerin C obtained 
by a subsurface procedure is being organized at the Shchelkovo 
Biological Works (Moscow Oblast), and production of preparations 
obtained by a subsurface-surface procedure is being organized at 
an experimental production operation of the VNIIF [All-Union 
Scientific Research Institute of Phytopathology] (Moscow Oblast). 
  Production of viral and microsporidial preparations (out of 
parasitic protozoans) is to begin in 1993 at experimental plants 
of the SK NIIF [not further identified] and the VNIIF; 
production of preparations consisting of entomopathogenic 
nematodes and their symbiotic bacteria (nemobakt) is to begin at 
the Kolpino EPP [not further identified] (Leningrad Oblast). 
  Pilot facilities were introduced in 1992 at the Kolpino EPP 
to perfect production of mikoafidin and entoks out of 
entomopathogenic fungi for use against aphids; of aleytsid and 
verticillin against the orange whitefly at the Leto PNO [not 
further identified] (Leningrad Oblast); of the viral preparation 
virin-GYaP against the coddling moth at the SK NIIF; of 
trichodermin in the city of Kirshi (Leningrad Oblast). 
  Experimental industrial production of the indicated 
preparations at pilot facilities is the first phase of 
establishing standard low-volume production of microbiological 
plant protection resources. 
  4. Seventy-nine biolaboratories, 13 biofactories, 41 oblast 
plant protection station shops, 159 greenhouse laboratories, 56 
farm and interfarm laboratories, 13 small enterprises and 10 
cooperatives are functioning within the Ministry of Agricultural 
Production. The Russian Ministry of Agricultural Production has 
begun the work of providing modern equipment for low-volume 
production of biopreparations to biolaboratories and 
biofactories. In 1992 the Sochi, Voronezh, Krasnodar, Mary and 
Kirov biolaboratories were equipped with fermenters with 
capacities of up to 1 m[.sup]3[/], separators, and other 
equipment for the production of liquid fungal and bacterial 
preparations. This work would have been more effective, had 
there been closer contact between specialists and scientists of 
the Russian Ministry of Agricultural Production and the Russian 
Agricultural Academy, and had they carried out coordinated 
programs. 
  The presidium of the Russian Agricultural Academy has 
determined the direction of scientific and technical support to 
organizing regional low-volume production of microbiological 
plant protection resources. Reaching scientific objectives in 
stages was proposed within the framework of the GNTP 
``Agricultural Production Processes of the Future'' and the 
``Plant Protection'' sector program of fundamental research. And 
namely: 

  -  conducting marketing research to substantiate the demand 
for microbiological resources for agriculture, and feasibility 
studies on low-volume production and its location; 
  -  searching for and creating promising strains of 
microorganisms 
producing microbiological plant protection resources, and 
developing new preparations on their basis; 
  -  developing the principles of creating all-purpose mechanized 
lines (units, modules) for large-scale breeding of insects; 
  -  creating genetic selection methods of selecting fungal 
producer 
strains that would work under the conditions of subsurface 
fermentation; 
  -  creating artificial nutrient media for entomopathogenic 
microorganisms; 
  -  developing the methods and principles of 
creating optimum preparative forms; 
  -  developing regulations on 
producing new microbiological resources adapted to regional 
production of agricultural crops; 
  -  improving and creating 
commercial forms of biopreparations intended for specific 
purposes--for seed treatment, for plant spraying and for soil 
application; 
  -  developing methods by which to assess the quality of 
microbiological resources, and unified standards in application 
to regional production; 
  -  planning individual, basic and standard 
models of regional low-volume production operations; 
  -  developing 
ecological and economic criteria of using microbiological 
preparations and regional procedures of their use. 

    Fundamental research aimed at finding microbiological 
resources is to be continued in scientific research institutes 
of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Russian Ministry of 
Health, as is applied experimental design work aimed at creating 
microbiological preparations at the State Scientific Research 
Institute of Applied Microbiology. 
  There are plans for supporting specific financing of 
fundamental research aimed at creating experimental industrial 
low-volume production operations, and for revamping the research 
base and developing experimental industrial facilities for 
low-volume production operations in the VIZR, VNIIF and SK NIIF.

<F P=106> [Article by Yu. M. Veretennikov, chief specialist, Agrosa </F>
LTD, and A. K. Lysov, director, mechanization laboratory, VIZR: 
``From Policy to Practical Deeds''] 
  [Text] Efforts to solve a problem upon which both the 
country's food sufficiency and the health of its citizens depend 
to a considerable degree have been at a standstill for many 
years. The problem? A perpetual shortage and low quality of 
equipment for pesticide application. With the disintegration of 
the USSR the situation has worsened even more--there are 
practically no specialized enterprises manufacturing sprayers 
left in Russia. 
  Machines made by the only plant in the CIS, 
Lvovkhimselkhozmash (in Ukraine), require significant 
improvement, and moreover, they are supplied to Russia at 
monopoly prices that are unjustifiably high. The situation is 
also aggravated by the fact that the sprayers presently 
available in the countryside are not only obsolete but also 
almost completely worn out. This means that growth of harvest 
losses and of the ecological danger is inevitable, because 
pesticides will be used not matter what, employing primitive 
methods and various contrivances. 
  All of this is happening at a time when the latest models of 
spraying equipment of various modifications and purposes that 
are competitive even in the foreign market have been created in 
Russia. Their advantages were confirmed by extensive field tests 
in different regions of the former USSR in the period from 1971 
to 1991. Because the demand of Russian agriculture for such 
equipment is enormous, it would be suitable to establish a 
subsector based on qualitatively new spraying procedures, and to 
encourage defense industry enterprises to contribute their 
resources. 
  The Agros LTD partnership, the VIZR [All-Union Institute of 
Plant Protection], the VISKhOM [All-Union Scientific Research 
Institute of Agricultural Machine Building] and the KBM [not 
further identified] of the Department of Defense Industry have 
united their efforts and proposed an innovative program to the 
government of the Russian Federation titled the ``Complex of 
Work to Organize Production of Technical Resources for 
Application of Chemical and Biological Plant Protection 
Resources and Plant Growth Regulators on the Basis of New 
Procedures Characterized by Minimum Ecologically Safe 
Consumption Norms,'' which is written for 1993-1996. The Russian 
Federation Agroindustrial Union was the client for the program. 
  Introduction of this innovative program into Russian 
agriculture will make it possible: 

  -  to reduce the energy- and material-intensiveness of 
production systems in comparison with existing ones by 1.5-2 
times; 
  -  to create a system of special equipment for high-precision 
application of pesticides and biologically active substances of 
a new generation with consumption rates from 1 to 100 gm/ha, 
thus ensuring clear patent rights and competitiveness of the 
machinery in the domestic and foreign markets; 
  -  to reduce the consumption rate of the preparations employed 
by 
1-3 times (for different types of preparations) by purposeful 
processing of plants with prescribed parameters and controllable 
drop size, which will have a positive effect on the ecological 
situation of agricultural communities; 
  -  to raise the effectiveness and uniformity of application of a 
preparation to the object of application, as a result of which 
entry of toxic chemicals into the environment will decrease by 
2-10 times, and loss of expensive preparations will drop; 
  -  to introduce resources into agricultural practice for 
monitoring and automating control of production processes used 
to apply chemical and biological plant protection resources; 
  -  to reach the posed objectives in coordination with regional 
``Saving the Black and Azov Seas'' programs, and with projects 
in continguous fields of science and engineering, and in 
particular, decontamination of areas subjected to radioactive 
contamination by the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power 
Plant. 

    We hope that this program will be adopted by the government. 
It's time from us to move on from policy to practical deeds!

  [Abstract] Most immunoassay methods of determining thyroxin 
are based on polyclonal sera. In most cases, this does not 
present any problems with respect to specificity of the said 
antibodies. Problems do arise in cases of antisera with a low 
titer resulting from the presence of endogenous thyroxin in 
immunized animals. A portion of the binding centers on the 
antibodies with the highest affinity are then occupied by 
endogenous thyroxin. This is a common problem in obtaining 
antibodies to endogenous compounds that can be overcome by using 
monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies to thyroxin with 
binding constants of 1.96 x 10[.sup]9[/] and 2.6 x 
10[.sup]9[/] M[.sup]-1[/] for the high-affinity antibodies 
have been obtained in several laboratories. Monoclonal 
antibodies have now been obtained that have a binding constant 
of 3 x 10[.sup]9[/] M[.sup]-1[/]. The new monoclonal 
antibodies were obtained by immunizing BALB/c mice with keyhole 
limpet hemocyanin and thyroxin conjugate and then fusing spleen 
cells from the immunized mice with P3-X63-Ag8.653 mouse myeloma 
cells. Polyethylene glycol 4000 was used as a fusing agent. 
About 400 clones formed in one hybridization. The four 
highest-affinity monoclonal antibodies (9T, 1B7, 2E10, and 10F9) 
were selected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] and 
partially characterized. The four monoclonal antibodies all 
manifested good binding with thyroxin, but they differed greatly 
from one another with respect to affinity to triiodothyronine. 
The hybridoma producing the said monoclonal antibodies grew well 
in ascites tumors. Antibodies were isolated from ascites by 
ion-exchange chromatography. According to gel-electrophoresis 
data, the ascites contained only one type of antibody, i.e., 
1B7. 1B7 was determined to belong to the IgG1 subclass and to 
have a cross-reactivity with triiodothyronine of less than 1 
percent and an affinity constant of 3 x 10[.sup]9[/] 
M[.sup]-1[/]. Further studies to determine the possibility of 
using the new antibodies in immunoassay of thyroxin established 
that 8-aniline-1-naphthalenesulfate in rather high 
concentrations (0.05 percent) did not affect antibody-antigen 
binding. The calibration cure obtained for thyroxin measurement 
was linear in log coordinates at thyroxin concentrations of 10 
to 400 ng/ml. Figures 4; references 8 (Russian).

  [Abstract] The work reported here is based on the 
assumption of dynamic domain organization of receptor molecules 
in biological membranes. According to that concept, the receptor 
molecules are structural elements of the cyclic process of the 
formation and decay of receptor domains, and they catalyze 
biochemical cell transformations, transport substances across 
membrane barriers, and generate cyclic electrical and 
biochemical changes. Cyclomononucleotides and inositol 
triphosphate operate as biochemical modulators of ion-channel 
permeability by blocking Ca- binding centers of gate mechanisms 
of receptor-domain ion channels, thereby mobilizing 
Ca[.sup]2+[/] ions in the cell from intracellular calcium 
depots and from the surrounding medium. Kinetic diagrams of the 
operation of the gate mechanisms are provided for instances in 
which ions or molecules capable of blocking just one Ca-binding 
center are present along with the Ca[.sup]2+[/] ions. Figures 
7, references 44: 6 Russian, 38 Western.

  [Abstract] A 24-base oligonucleotide was used for the 
preparation of a mutant gene of human lymphotoxin (tumor 
necrosis factor _b_) lacking 21 N-terminal codons. The mutant 
gene was then introduced into plasmid pLT21, constructed by 
recombination of plasmid pLT18 with phage M13LT2. pLT21, with 
the lymphotoxin gene controlled by tandem constitutive T7 
coliphage promoters, was employed in the transformation of E. 
coli SG20050. Ultrasonication of the transformed E. coli cells 
and successive chromatography of the supernatant on 
DEAE-cellulose DE-52 and hydroxyapatite yielded 5.6 mg of the 
recombinant protein per 3 g of wet cells. Cytopathic activity of 
the preparation on L-929 murine fibroblasts was on the order of 
5 x 10E7 U/mg protein. Figures 3; references 24: 9 Russian, 15

  [Abstract] In order to obtain adequate quantities of 
metastasin (mst-1)--an S-100_b_ protein--for biological 
studies, 
genetic engineering was employed for the construction of an 
expression vector for transformation of E. coli. Transformation 
of E. coli with plasmid pMAL-C bearing the mst-1 gene yielded 
approximately 40 mg of recombinant metastasin from 5 g of wet 
cells. The recombinant product was longer than the native 
peptide by an additional 13 amino acid residues on the 
N-terminal end. However, its ability to bind calcium ions was 
not affected. Thus, the tertiary structure of the recombinant 
metastasin appears to differ little from the native protein and 
should be suitable for biological investigations, including the 
generation of poly- and monoclonal antibodies. Figures 3; 
references 33 (Western).

  [Abstract] Automated solid-phase amidophosphite methods 
(Victoria-4M and Applied Biosystems 380B systems) were employed 
for the synthesis oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing 
2'-amino-2'-deoxyribopyridine nucleosides residues. The 12 
compounds were 5 to 20 nucleotides long, some of which 
corresponded to stretches of 5S rRNA of E.coli. Oligonucleotides 
bearing 2'-amino-2'-deoxyribopyridines withstood acid 
hydrolysis, with the amino groups undergoing acetylation and 
reacting with FITC to form fluorescent compounds. CD spectra and 
melting studies showed that the 2'-amino-2'-deoxypyridine 
moieties destabilized DNA-duplexes. Comparative evaluation 
indicated that such derivatized oligodeoxyribonucleotides with a 
high G:C content may find application as hybridization probes; 
similar arguments apply to derivatives with modifications on the 
3'- or 5'-ends of the oligonucleotides. Figures 6: Tables 1; 
references 19: 6 Russian, 13 Western.

  [Abstract] Homogenous phosphotriesterase synthesis was 
employed for the preparation of oligonucleotides derivatized on 
the 5'- or 3'-ends with DDP or Fe(III)DDP in 15-30 min in yields 
approaching 95%. Both agents were effective in modifying 
DNA, 
particularly Fe(III)DDP in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. 
The reaction mechanisms involved covalent adduct formation 
adjacent to a guanosine duplex, direct scission of the DNA, as 
well as molecular lesions that led to DNA cleavage after 
addition of piperidine. In analogy to porphyrins, the 
derivatized oligonucleotids also bound to HeLa, bone marrow and 
Krebs-2 ascitic carcinoma cells. These observations support the 
contention that oligonucleotides derivatized with DDP and 
Fe(III)DDP may have applications in modifying gene expression.

  [Abstract] An immunochemical assessment was carried out on 
neurotoxin RM-III of the sea anemone Radianthus macrodactylus 
using specific polyclonal rabbit IgG antibodies. Solid-phase 
immunoenzyme studies showed that native Rm-III reacted with the 
antibodies with and I[.sup]50[/] of 1.4 x 10E-9 M. Inhibition 
studies involving the anti-Rm-III antibodies and related toxins 
with diminishing homologies with Rm-III yielding showed a rise 
in I[.sup]50[/] to 3.7 x 10E-6 M for the least homologous 
toxin. Correlation of the immunochemical findings with amino 
acid sequences showed that the epitopes of the homologous toxins 
share identical structural dispositions that encompass amino 
acids at positions 2, 11, 20, 28 and 46-48. Figures 3; tables 3;

  [Abstract] Monoclonal antibodies against _a_-latrotoxin 
(LT) isolated from the venom of the spider Latrodectus mactans 
tredecimguttatus were tested for their impact on LT-mediated 
physiological effects. The findings showed that none of the 
antibodies inhibited LT binding to rat brain synaptosomes, but 
may interfere with channel-forming and/or secretogenic 
functions. Calcium permeability of synaptosomes was not affected 
by 2 antibodies (A15, A19), but completely abolished by 3 (A4, 
A6, A24). Two antibodies (A6 and A24) blocked GABA release from 
synapsomes, while one (A4) was only partially inhibitory. In 
addition, A15 and A19 did not affect GABA release. In 
combination with studies on channel formation in BLM (in no case 
was insertion of LT into BLM completely abolished by an 
antibody), these observations demonstrated that binding and 
channel-forming functions of LT can be uncoupled. Therefore, the 
data indicate that LT possesses several functional sites. These 
include a receptor-binding site, a site for channel formation 
with calcium-dependent secretogenic effect, a site for 
calcium-independent secretogenic effect, and a site promoting 
channel formation in BLM. Figures 3; tables 1; references 21: 4

  [Abstract] Various strains of E. coli were tested for 
efficiency in expression of the human interleukin-3 (HIL3) gene 
borne by plasmids pTOTE2IL3 (induced biosynthesis) or pTE2IL3 
(constitutive). The results showed that under appropriate 
combinatons of expression vector and host HIL3 yields approached 
30-40% of total cell protein. Such optimal combinations 
were 
represented by E. coli HB101 and pTEIL3, and E. coli TG1 and 
pTOTE2L3. Precipitation, ultrafiltration and purification via 
HPLC provided IL3 preparations with a purity of &gt;  98% 
and a 
specific activities on the order of 5 x 10E6 U/mg. Figures 6;

  [Abstract] Protein hydrolysates with low phenylalanine 
content represent the principal component of the protein diet of 
children suffering from phenylketonuria, a disease associated 
with a congenital disorder of the phenylalanine metabolism and 
the result of genetic blocking of the oxidation of that amino 
acid into tyrosine. Devising low-phenylalanine diets that use 
proteins of plant or animal origin capable of countering that 
problem is difficult because phenylalanine shows up in all 
nutritional proteins in rather large quantities. The primary raw 
material for producing low-phenylalanine hydrolysates is casein, 
which is easily assimilated by a child's body and is readily 
available. Casein undergoes specific enzymatic hydrolysis for 
what is possibly the most complete release of phenylalanine from 
the polypeptide chain, the phenylalanine then being removed from 
the hydrolysate with a number of techniques. The researchers 
here developed optimum parameters for the targeted enzymatic 
hydrolysis of casein. Much of the phenylalanine was removed from 
the hydrolysate via adsorption on activated charcoal, 
ion-exchange resins, or molecular sieves. After adsorption on 
activated charcoal, the phenylalanine content was 0.3 mg/ml or 
less, which makes possible the production of dry preparations 
with a phenylalanine content of about 1 mg/ml. Figures 2, 
references 11: 1 Russian, 5 Polish, 3 Western, 1 GDR, 1 Japanese.

  [Abstract] In a study of the in vitro resistance of varying 
compositions of liposomes to phospholipase A[.sup]2[/], the 
researchers used phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerine, 
phosphatidylinosite, phosphatidylethanolamine, and their 
mixtures with sphingomyelin to prepare the liposomes. Liposome 
stability was studied with liposomes consisting of an equimolar 
mixture of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerine in 
phospholipase hydrolysis in the presence of cytochrome c, 
cytochrome b[.sup]5[/], cytochrome P[.sub]450[/], 
polylysine, and the histone H[.sup]1[/]. Twenty minutes after 
the beginning of the reaction in the sphingomyelin-containing 
liposomes, some 65 percent of the phosphatidylglycerine 
remained. The amount of phosphatidylinosite left was 62 percent; 
phosphatidylethanolamine, 55 percent; phosphatidylcholine, 50 
percent. When phosphatidylglycerine was incorporated into the 
liposomes, phosphatidylcholine content after processing with 
phospholipase A[.sup]2[/] was 15-20 percent higher than in 
control. The researchers found that the presence of the proteins 
had a strong stabilizing effect on the components of binary 
liposomes (with phosphatidylglycerine and phosphatidylcholine), 
but virtually no effect on single-component liposomes. Binary 
liposomes incorporating negatively charged phosphatidylglycerine 
were found to be the most resistant to phospholipase 
A[.sup]2[/]. That was attributed to the asymmetric 
distribution of the phospholipids between the outer and inner 
layers of the phospholipid vesicles. That the liposome surfaces 
were screened by the proteins was viewed as possible, as was the 
electrostatic interaction of positively charged proteins present 
in the surrounding medium and the negatively charged lipid 
component, which would partially protect the liposome from 
lipolytic enzymes. Figures 2, references 16: 4 Russian, 12 
Western.

  [Abstract] The conformational changes in a membrane that 
are due to a change in temperature, pH, Me[.sup]2+[/], or 
electrical field represent one possible mechanism of the 
appearance of electrical signals in receptor membranes and 
excitable membranes. Information in living organisms is 
transferred via electrical impulses, which means that, at the 
membrane level, there must be elements that transform every 
possible type of external event into electrical signals. The 
transformation mechanism is localized in the cell membrane, 
which contains receptor structures and is capable of generating 
an electrical response. Membrane potentials arise as a result of 
the selective diffusion of ions through individual transmembrane 
pores. The bilayer lipid membrane has trigger properties that 
are important from the standpoint of sensory systems, i.e., in 
physiological systems, it can be in two conformational states 
(gel and liquid crystalline). Experiments on flat bilayer lipid 
membranes have demonstrated that when a fixed voltage is present 
on a membrane, the transition from liquid- crystalline state to 
gel phase is accompanied by electrical signals that are ionic 
and capacitive. Membranes consisting of charged lipids are of 
particular interest to researchers, because they are sensitive 
to the external environment and to exposure to protons, divalent 
ions, pressure, and electrical field. The researchers here use 
measurements of electrical parameters in phase transformations 
induced by changes in Me[.sup]2+[/] concentration in bilayer 
lipid membranes consisting of acidic lipids to demonstrate that 
the phase transition is accompanied by capacitive currents 
comparable in magnitude and direction to the so-called gate 
currents of excitable membranes and by increased permeability 
for cations. Figures 2, references 9: 3 Russian, 6 Western.

  [Abstract] The natural exoenzymatic decomposition of 
lignocellulose is performed by aerobic bacteria, actinomycetes, 
and fungi in ecological microbial succession. Technologies for 
the microbial conversion of cellulose to produce protein, 
glucose, alcohol, and fuels are being developed on that basis. 
But the supramolecular structure of cellulose and its 
association with other components of the plant cell -- 
specifically, lignin and hemicellulose -- represent a serious 
obstacle to enzymatic attack and effective conversion. Although 
chemical processing of substrates is widely used to raise 
nutritional value and to intensify the processes of 
biotransformation, reagents are difficult to regenerate, 
equipment has strict requirements, and the process is expensive. 
Since depolymerases of symbiotic microorganisms effect 
decomposition in natural biocenoses, the researchers here chose 
to examine rapidly growing micromycetes that produce an entire 
complex of depolymerases. The most promising such micromycetes, 
in their view, were strains of the Aspergillus 
fungus, because they produce a broad range of hydrolytic 
enzymes. The researchers used Aspergillus sp. 
VKPMF-559 in the direct conversion of corn cobs. The protein 
yield over an 18-hour period of cultivation was 17.2 percent, 
with 80 percent utilization of cellulose. Figures 2, references 
21: 9 Russian, 12 Western.

  [Abstract] Enzymes produced by microorganisms have been 
used in recent years to produce compounds such as epoxides. 
Certain epoxides -- ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, in 
particular -- serve as the raw material for the synthesis of 
many polymer- chemistry materials. An active enzyme system that 
catalyzes the reaction of formation of those epoxides is found 
solely in microorganisms that use gaseous alkanes as the carbon 
source. Microorganisms that use propane and butane as the carbon 
source, however, are little studied, although papers devoted to 
propane- utilizing microorganisms first appeared in the early 
1980s and, in the last two years, have focused on the study of 
the metabolism of propane and various enzymes. Interest in the 
distinctive properties of an enzyme system that effects a 
reaction of hydrooxidation prompted the researchers here to 
isolate strains of microorganisms that grow on propane, describe 
the strains, and study the conditions underlying the cultivation 
of the microorganisms to produce a biomass that can be used in 
the reaction associated with the epoxidation of propylene into 
propylene oxide. Out of 85 cultures studied, they managed to 
produce a culture -- Rhodococcus erythropolis 3/89 -- 
that, when grown in an atmosphere of propane, evidenced an 
active monooxygenase enzyme system in the cells of the 
microorganisms, the system being capable of catalyzing the 
sought-after epoxidation. The culture uses alcohols 
(C[.sup]2[/]-C[.sub]4[/]), the monosaccharide 
C[.sup]6[/], and disaccharides, as well as the salts of 
certain organic acids. References 22: 2 Russian, 20 Western.

  [Abstract] Enzyme immunoassay is widely used in biology, 
medicine, and the food industry because of its high level of 
sensitivity, which is primarily the result of the marker 
enzyme/ligand conjugates used in the analysis. The researchers 
here create conjugates consisting of a ligand and laccase 
extracted from the culture fluid of Coriolus 
hirsutus, and they use the reagents in various enzyme 
immunoassays and compare the properties of the reagents with 
those of immunoperoxidase conjugates. The laccase conjugates can 
be used in sandwich, concurrent, and indirect EIA. The absolute 
sensitivity of laccase/antibody conjugates was shown to be 
threefold higher than that of similar peroxidase conjugates (7.7 
x 10[.sup]-11[/] M versus 2.3 x 10[.sup]-10[/]). The use 
of laccase conjugates simplifies the assay process by its use of 
atmospheric oxygen as a second substrate for the enzymatic 
reaction. Figures 5, references 17: 4 Russian, 13 Western.

  [Abstract] In studying the survival capabilities of 
xenotransplantates of embryonal neurosecretory nuclei of the 
human hypothalamus in the rat brain and the morphogenesis of 
neurosecretory cells, the researchers here transplanted the 
nuclei into 30 mature female white rats. The transplants 
survived in 11 rats (36.7 percent) as clusters of neural and 
glial cells. [.sup]3[/]H-thymidine was incorporated into the 
neurosecretory cells to varying degrees. The most active 
proliferation of neuroblasts was found in rats injected with the [.sup]3 
[/] 
H- thymidine four weeks or eight weeks after the 
transplantation. Rats injected 16 weeks after transplantation 
demonstrated a considerably lower level of proliferation. 
Average volume of nuclei and nucleoli grew with time. The degree 
of differentiation of large-cell supraoptic and paraventricular 
neurons in the transplanted tissue varied as it would in normal 
ontogenesis. Figures 3, references 18: 8 Russian, 10 Western.

  [Abstract] Transplantation of embryonal neural tissue is a 
widely used technique because it makes it possible to stimulate 
regeneration processes in the brain and to adjust a whole array 
of disrupted CNS functions. The researchers here studied the 
behavior of cells after migration in an embryonic cortex and 
after transplantation into the cortex of intact female Wistar 
rats in order to determine, specifically, the nature of the 
migration demonstrated by neurons and glial cells and the 
positions occupied by the migrating neurons of the transplantate 
in the brain of the recipient. The label for the donor cells, [.sup]3[/] 

H-thymidine, was injected intraperitoneally twice a 
day on days 12, 13, and 14 of the pregnancy, so as to 
incorporate the isotope in the neurons of layers 1, 5, and 6 and 
in the nuclei of some astrocytes. The embryos were removed on 
day 20, and cortical fragments were transplanted. The animals 
were sacrificed on day 50 and studied. Transplanted cells that 
had migrated were clearly visible in 6 rats. The distribution 
throughout the brain of glial cells that had migrated was much 
broader than that of the neurons and was similar to the movement 
of astrocytes from the suspension grafts. Postmigration neurons 
were found to be capable of repeated migration. No large 
neurons, however, migrated. No donor neurons migrated to the 
layers of their origin, i.e., neurons from layers 1, 5, and 6 
were found in layers 2 and 3. Figures 6, references 32: 3

  [Abstract] Descriptive analysis was conducted on the 
application of compartmental models in toxokinetics, using 
examples dealing with several Cr. F, B, Pb and Zn compounds. A 
review of available information points to the advantages of the 
compartmental approach to the pharmacokinetics of toxicants, 
rather than reliance on a generalized system data. The key 
factor in compartmental analysis is the flexibility with which 
individual tissues, organs or body fluids of interest can be 
monitored and analyzed for kinetic parameters, with information 
on the different compartments then combined for an overall 
assessment. Figures 2; references 20: 17 Russian, 3 Western.

  [Abstract] Trials on albino mice and rabbits infected with 
wild or fixed rabies viruses demonstrated that reserpine exerted 
a dose-dependent protective effect. Survival rates of 40 to 
83.4% prevailed in mice infected intramuscularly with 8-10 
LD[.sup]50[/] viral dose and treated per os or 
intramuscularly with 0.01 or 0.05 mg/kg/day of reserpine (24 h 
before infection and for 1-2 days thereafter, or 30-60 min after 
infection and for 3-4 days thereafter). Analogous studies on 
rabbits yielded 100% survival vs. 33.3% for 
placebo controls. 
Reserpine treatment was also seen to prolong the incubation 
period two-fold. These observations indicate that reserpine may 
be a promising agent for use in combined therapy of rabies in 
conjunction with vaccines. Tables 2; references 10: 8 Russian, 2

  [Abstract] The mechanism of ingress of Marburg virus (MV), 
strain Voege, into eukaryotic cells was deduced from studies 
involving modulation of penetration into Vero-E6 cell culture by 
the ionophore monensin and ammonium chloride (AC). Both agents, 
which act on lysosomes, inhibited replication of MV when added 
with the virus to the cell culture or used to pretreat the cells 
before exposure to the virus. Complete inhibition was obtained 
with 20-30 mM AC in a dose-dependent fashion, while monensin 
gave a maximum yield reduction (&gt;  3 log units) at a 
concentration of 5 ÊM. Treatment of the cells with AC 1-2 h 
after adsorption was ineffective. Furthermore, blockage by 20 mM 
AC was precluded by exposure of the virus-cell surface complex 
to pH 4.6 for 10 min to induce membrane fusion. These 
observations were interpreted to favor endocytosis as the 
mechanism by which MV enters target cells. Figures 3; references 
7: (Western).

  [Abstract] The interaction of the components of the 
principle of preservation of sterility in a multistage system is 
described as fermenter sterilization that is coincident with the 
inflow of the nutritive medium and the outflow of the mature 
culture fluid, with a clear-cut separation of the new and old 
fluids. The principle itself is such that if the movement of the 
fluid coincides with the successive prophylactic sterilization 
of the unoccupied parts of the viaduct, the controlled sterility 
of the fermentation medium is preserved, and the medium remains 
uncontaminated for an infinitely long time. As a corollary of 
that, if the prophylactic sterilization of individual parts of 
the viaduct coincides with the continuous movement of the fluid, 
the controlled (or initial) sterility is maintained for an 
infinitely long period of time. The researcher suggests that all 
biotechnology production be converted to the contamination-free 
continuous method, which will also result in a twofold gain in 
productivity. Figures 5, references 4 (Russian).

<F P=106> [Article by correspondent Vasiliy Kalita: ``What Do You Feed </F>
an Infant?''] 
  [Text] We adults have gotten used to 
all kinds of deprivations. But what is an infant just born to 
the light of day to eat? This is a very urgent question in the 
Ukrainian capital. 
  A young mom inquired at one of the children's polyclinics in 
Kiev: ``Doctor, please give me a prescription for some baby 
food. I can't find any, and he isn't breast feeding....'' A 
joke? Unfortunately, no. Mothers of newborn infants have started 
turning to doctors as a last resort. 
<H5>  A Kitchen Where They Don't Make Anything </H5>
  I went to the nearest children's dairy kitchen which, 
according to the idea, was supposed to provide assistance to 
mothers and children first. They looked at me like I had just 
fallen from the Moon: 
  ``We don't make anything at all for newborn infants, but we 
do make some things for older children starting to eat solid 
food.'' 
  What is an unfortunate mom to feed an infant being raised on 
formula--that's 70 percent of the infants in the city, by the 
way? 
  As it turns out there are two solutions to our situation. 
The 
first is to go to the market and buy imported baby food there. 
But given an impoverished existence, far from every mother can 
allow herself to do this. You have to put out 1,500-2,000 
karbovantsy in coupons for a package of formula. For some 
mothers this is a month's wages. The second option is left to 
them--going to the dairy store. After standing a couple of hours 
in line, such a mother would buy milk, dilute it, and give it to 
the youngster. If the child is a little older, she would prepare 
a gruel of some sort. But this is hardly what a youngster needs 
for normal development, just so that its legs would grow strong. 
  ``Yes, that's the way it is,'' was the confirmation I got to 
my conclusions at the Main Territorial Medical Association under 
the state administration. ``We are seriously troubled by this 
issue, and we've been trying to do something about it for a long 
time....'' 
  In our city there are 28,000 youngsters up to 1 year old. 
Nutrition support is catastrophic. Given an annual demand for 
dry adapted--that is, prepared according to all of the 
rules--formulas of 705 tonnes, the trade system hasn't sold 
anything for the last year and a half. The absence of such food 
products forces parents to feed their youngsters whatever they 
can. And this raises morbidity and mortality. 
  Could it be the older youngsters are in a better position? 
If 
only that were true: Given a daily demand of 450,000 baby food 
portions, five times less is actually prepared for them. 
  And what can you ask those 13 dairy kitchens (for the entire 
population of 3 million) to do? Their output is low, they are 
primitive, with manual labor dominating. How can there be any 
discussion of quantity and quality of food products? And it is 
impossible to reequip them: All of them are set up in 
residential buildings, and you're not going to start filling 
them with industrial equipment. 
  So who can you count on? On the city's dairy industry? Yes, 
it does produce sterilized milk in 200 gm packages. But this is 
only 1.8 tonnes, as compared to a daily demand of 7. 
  The city is feeling an acute shortage of juices and of 
strained fruits and vegetables. The demand for them is 15-20 
percent satisfied. The assortment is extremely limited. 
  With our life today being as difficult as it is, there are 
many needs to be met. In the opinion of some officials there are 
problems of even greater importance, and so this one--baby 
food--is relegated to the back burner. There's also the 
psychological set that somehow we'll squeak by with the help of 
a kind uncle. Yes, kind foreign uncles organizing humanitarian 
aid can be found. The city received a hundred tons of food for 
youngsters. It was immediately distributed among the rayons. 
However, this is but a drop in the ocean. And the spring is 
extremely unreliable--today it's flowing, but tomorrow it may 
dry up. 
  No, we need to resolutely seek and find our own domestic 
sources. 
<H5>  The Legacy--24 Decrees </H5>
  This problem didn't of course come up just today, or even 
yesterday. It is a legacy of former times. The former Ukrainian 
Communist Party Central Committee and Ukrainian Council of 
Ministers adopted 24 decrees on this issue in the last few 
years. To what end? The Khorol and Balta baby food plants 
existing today in Poltava and Odessa oblasts have stopped 
putting out the products children need. It would have been nice 
to organize production of the popular baby food Vitalakt in 
Kiev, but beginning this year it will no longer be produced. 
  Ukrainian scientists and specialists in baby food have 
created other food products. Samples have been tested, and all 
of the requirements on goods of this kind have been 
observed--homogeneity, sterilized raw materials, preservation of 
nutritional value, modern preparation procedures. And all of 
this has been gathering dust on archive shelves for years on 
end. Is an enterprise that would accept responsibility for 
placing the developments of scientists into production, one 
which would work for the good of the children, really not to be 
found in a city of 3 million? And what about the farmers? If 
they wanted to, of course they could find the needed raw 
materials. 
  Baby food is not a public health problem. Nonetheless, the 
Main Territorial Medical Association of the state administration 
is energetically trying to get something going. S. Osipenko, a 
pediatrician by trade who knows her business well and the 
director of the association's department for safeguarding 
maternity and childhood, showed me a thick file of 
correspondence with higher and other bodies of administration. 
Medical workers have done more than just provide warnings of the 
disastrous situation--they offered and continue to offer 
specific proposals that take the difficulties of the current 
economic situation in Ukraine into account. 
  The first proposal is, let us say, the minimum program: 
appropriating the needed amount of hard currency to the city for 
the purchase of baby food abroad. 
  Sima Ivanovna Osipenko showed me samples of such products. 
One is made by a Polish company--Bebiko. The mother places a few 
spoonsful of the package contents in water, and a minute later 
she can feed her infant. Or there's strained corn produced by an 
Israeli company--tasty, nourishing, and extremely easy to 
manufacture. 
  It would be good to buy such things. But they are expensive, 
and beyond the means of many mothers. Subsidies are necessary. 
This is what the Main Territorial Medical Association took to 
the city's state administration. 
  But we also need to think about the maximum program--we 
can't 
buy food products abroad forever, we need to learn how to 
produce them ourselves. To finally surmount the disastrous 
situation, medical specialists propose, as a beginning, 
accelerating construction of a specialized shop at City Dairy No 
4 in Minskiy Rayon, and a baby food factory-kitchen in 
Troyeshchina-Vygurovshchina producing 40,000 portions per shift. 
  But why has the health service been working alone on this 
problem all of these years? Why is the trade department, which 
could make a certain contribution to eliminating the shortage if 
it so desired, sitting on the sidelines? 
  Interested departments were convened at the offices of the 
state administration's department of food, trade and the 
consumer market in order to discuss this problem, and to finally 
come up with specific ways of solving it. Trade workers from the 
state-run company Kiyev were invited to the conference. The 
question of purchasing imported baby foods was thoroughly 
discussed. The Kiyev firm was directed to implement the 
proposal--in particular, to make contact with foreign firms and 
make the best deal. And so, what happened? A considerable amount 
of time has passed, but things still haven't gotten off the 
ground. There remains the maximum program--organizing our own 
production. Specialists unanimously agreed that this question 
has to be resolved at the state level. If we are unable to do 
so, we will be faced by a universal increase in the morbidity 
and mortality of young children, including infants up to a year 
old, and steady worsening of the demographic situation. Are we 
really going to let things slide until even more women decide 
not to have any children at all?

  [Abstract] The work done by G.V. Gershuni and his 
associates in relation to subsensory reactions provided the 
first proof that the problem of unconscious perception in human 
psychology, specifically the problem of unconsciously perceived 
audio signals, may be resolved successfully by the natural 
science route by means of experimental physiological research. 
Gershuni's research in the area of humans' bioelectric and 
autonomic reactions to unconsciously perceived audio stimulation 
began in 1942 and ceased in 1950. During that relatively brief 
period, Gershuni developed the concept of the subsensory zone of 
human consciousness, i.e., that region of the unconscious state 
within whose confines stimuli not consciously perceived by a 
person can affect that person's mental and physiological 
functions. One of Gershuni's associates, A.M. Maruseva, made the 
interesting discovery that the intensity of audio stimulation 
sufficient for conscious perception by a person decreases by 10 
dB upon repeated exposure to a given stimulant while that same 
person's cutaneogalvanic reaction and eye movements in response 
to the said stimulant will remain unchanged. Gershuni's research 
on various autonomic and bioelectric reactions to audio stimuli 
led him to the conclusion that the suppression of alpha-rhythm 
to sounds of different strength and simultaneously recorded 
cutaneogalvanic reactions are both components of an orientation 
reflex. Gershuni's thinking regarding the existence of a 
cortical electrical component of the orientation reflex and the 
concept of a multicomponent orientation reflex as a centrally 
integrated reaction has since been confirmed by others and has 
proved to be a very productive concept in the study of 
subsensory reactions. Gershuni identified two types of 
subsensory reactions. The first, either autonomic or 
bioelectric, is induced by trauma or hysteria (i.e., by brain 
pathology) and is manifested as a steady decrease in the 
excitability of the structures of a given sensory system. The 
second is observed under conditions of the normal activity of 
the human central nervous system. Research conducted by Gershuni 
and his associates during World War II established that patients 
suffering from closed craniocerebral trauma manifested a 
cutaneogalvanic response to audio stimuli that were 30-40 dB 
below the audibility threshold. The size of the subsensory zone 
of one and the same patient has since been shown to fluctuate 
from 0 to 50 dB from day to day depending on that patient's 
clinical condition: The subsensory zone becomes bigger as a 
patient's emotional state deteriorates. Gershuni's work on 
subsensory reactions has been used by others, including I.S. 
Beritashvili, to explain the nervous mechanisms of blind 
people's spatial orientation. Beritashvili's work provided 
additional confirmation of Gershuni's notion that during 
pathological states of the central nervous system, the number of 
external stimuli that are not consciously perceived by a person 
but that induce various autonomic, bioelectric, and motor 
reactions increase significantly. Another important contribution 
of Gershuni and his associates was the idea (which he confirmed 
through laboratory studies) that the simultaneous effect of a 
set of stimulants on the sense organs creates conditions 
favorable to the formation of subsensory conditioned reactions. 
Gershuni's work in the area of the physiological mechanisms of 
unconscious psychic phenomena in man was abruptly halted in the 
early 1950s by what has since been termed the ``Pavlov'' joint 
session of the two academies. His work was only rebegun and 
continued 20 years later, but by different teams of researchers. 
One continuation of Gershuni's work has been in the form of 
studies of the effect of photostimulation on the audio stimulus 
detection threshold of healthy persons, patients suffering from 
the consequences of craniocerebral trauma, and individuals with 
emotionally labile personalities. Other areas that Gershuni's 
work has been taken up are that of the link between focused 
attention and the fixing of information in the long-term memory 
and the effect of unconsciously perceived words associated with 
negative emotional experiences. Perhaps Gershuni's most 
important hypothesis was that the levels of organization of 
nervous activity required for conditioned reflex responses and 
perceptions are not identical (albeit close to one another) and 
that perception requires a higher degree of organization of 
nervous processes than simple conditioned reflexes do.

  [Abstract] A study examined the effect of the antioxidant 
oxymetacyl (6-methyl-5-oxyuracyl) in doses of 4-5 mg/kg 
(injected intramuscularly) on the cognitive characteristics of 
three rhesus monkeys that had been taught to perform the task of 
delayed visual differentiation of stimuli of different colors. 
Bundles of microelectrodes were used to simultaneously register 
the activity of several single neurons (up to four) of the 
monkeys' visual cortex. The pulse activity of each neuron was 
registered over several hours. At each stage of the visual 
recognition process, the average frequency of neuronal activity 
and other statistical characteristics were calculated, and 
graphs of auto- and cross-correlation functions of neuronal 
activity were plotted. The number of correct decisions made by 
the monkeys and their motor response times were recorded. During 
the course of the study, 212 visual cortex neurons were 
registered. The motor response times and skill of the three 
monkeys in differentiating the colors of test rectangles varied 
greatly. The response time of monkey 1 was 1.5 to 2 times faster 
than those of monkeys 2 and 3, and before the oxymetacyl 
injections, monkeys 1 and 2 were could not correctly 
differentiate colors with a frequency greater than that of 
random guessing after delays of 4 seconds, whereas the ability 
of monkey 3 to successfully differentiate colors did not 
deteriorate to the frequency of random guessing until the delay 
was increased to 32 seconds. Despite these significant 
differences between the individual monkeys' skill levels before 
receiving injections of oxymetacyl, they all manifested 
identical behavioral and neurophysiological responses to the 
antioxidant. With rare exceptions, the likelihood of all of the 
monkeys making a correct color decision increased at all the 
delay times tested. In the case of monkeys 1 and 2, their 
duration of short-term memory of information after the 
oxymetacyl injections increased by a factor of 2 to 4. The time 
required for a correct motor response after the oxymetacyl 
injections also increased significantly in the case of all three 
monkeys. A corresponding significant decrease in time required 
for the monkey to make an incorrect decision was also noted. All 
of these changes in behavioral characteristics after the 
injection of oxymetacyl were accompanied by significant 
rearrangements of the pulse activity of the neurons of the 
visual cortex of all three monkeys in all four stages of the 
color recognition process. The study results were interpreted as 
an indication that oxymetacyl possesses nootropic properties. 
The observed behavioral changes following the injection of 
oxymetacyl were attributed to oxymetacyl's ability to increase 
the efficiency of control processes such as selective attention 
and motivation. Figures 6; references 17: 12 Russian, 5 Western.

Research Institute, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, Moscow; 
UDC 612.42:577.151.17] 
  [Abstract] The phase contractile activity of the lymphatic 
microvessels of the mesentery of the rat small intestine was 
studied. The studies were performed in the morning on 90 unfed 
nonpedigree male rats that weighed 210-320 g each and that had 
been anesthetized with nembutal (0.1 g/kg injected 
intramuscularly). A photometry-based method was used to record 
the phase contractile activity of the wall and the motor 
activity of the valves of lymphatic microvessels located in 
three segments of the mesentery: the ``transparent'' section, 
the section around the adipose tissue at the periphery of the 
mesentery, and in the adipose tissue itself. The microvessels 
studied ranged from 30 to 300 Êm in diameter. During the 
course of the studies, leu-enkephalin, naloxone hydrochloride, 
dalargin, and adrenalin hydrochloride were applied to the 
surface of the lymphatic microvessels in doses of 0.004 to 40.0 
Êg per kilogram of the animal's weight in 0.1 ml of a 0.14 M 
sodium chloride solution. Computer processing of the study data 
confirmed that the lymphatic microvessels of the rat mesentery 
do not contract rhythmically either spontaneously or under the 
effect of opioid peptides. Leu-enkephalin and dalargin (40 
Êg/kg) increased contractile activity to different degrees. 
Leu-enkephalin mainly affected the valves: It activated the 
frequency and doubled the amount of time for which the cusps 
were closed. It had a lesser effect on the microvessels' walls 
but did increase the duration of each contraction. Dalargin, on 
the other hand, did not affect the valves even 30 minutes after 
application but did activate the walls of the lymphatic vessels. 
The combination of the opiate receptor antagonist naloxone or 
adrenalin with leu-enkephalin, both soon (15-20 minutes) and 
long (1.5-2 hours) after application, caused the walls of the 
lymphatic microvessels to be hypersensitive to nonspecific 
stimuli (a physiological solution of sodium chloride or air 
stream). Adrenalin and naloxone modulated the lymph-stimulating 
effect of leu-enkephalin and dalargin by inhibiting the 
lymphatic microvessels' contractile activity. Figures 5, table 
1; references 20: 17 Russian, 3 Western.

<F P=106> [Article by Oleg Lezin: ``The Club of Voters Attached to the </F>
Russian Academy of Sciences Storms Parliament''] 
  [Text] ``Who is for whom?''--this question was this time 
probably the most interesting one in the absorbing game called 
``The Election Campaign.'' Shortly before the election the 
politically most active part of the academic community--the 
members of the Club of Voters attached to the Russian Academy of 
Sciences--decided to direct attention to their ``party 
affiliation.'' A press conference was held in this regard at the 
Parliamentary Center. 
  Thus, with whom is the KIAN [Club of Voters attached to the 
Russian Academy of Sciences]? The club decided to support two 
blocs: the one headed by Yavlinskiy, Boldyrev, and Lukin, and 
Russia's Choice. Lyudmila Vakhnina, cochairman of the KIAN, 
noted that many scientists had displayed adherence to 
principles, having chosen in favor of Choice, in spite of the 
fact that they were in the social category which had suffered 
greatly during the reforms. 
  As Aleksey Zakharov, a member of the Coordinating Council of 
the club, explained at the press conference, this was done for 
the following reasons. Russia's Choice is the party of power, 
which needs constructive opposition. For the good of the reforms 
that are being implemented by it. Especially now, when in the 
structures of power there are forces that are trying to suppress 
any displays of dissidence. The alternative democratic bloc 
should become such opposition. The bloc of Yavlinskiy, they 
decided in the KIAN, will cope best of all with this task. 
  Moreover, it had not been possible to discover in the 
programs of any of the associations provisions in which science 
was specified as a sphere of state interest. The KIAN has a plan 
of the reform of science, and the bloc of Yavlinskiy had 
integrated it into its own program. In the opinion of A. 
Zakharov, the mistake of the reformers was that they, having 
indicated the necessity of state support of world-level 
research, did not propose a mechanism of its selection. As a 
result real transformations did not occur, while the financing 
of all research and development was merely cut back. The Club of 
Voters believes that the competitive financing of priority 
research in case of an independent examination and the creation 
of the appropriate legislative base should be at the basis of 
the new scientific and technical policy. 
  The support group of the bloc of Yavlinskiy from the KIAN 
gathered about 10,000 signatures of voters in support of the 
bloc, mainly at regional academic centers. Eight candidates from 
six regional organizations of scientists were placed on the 
ticket of the ``Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin Bloc'' association, 
while Aleksey Zakharov was nominated for the State Duma on the 
federal part of the ticket. 
  We will report in subsequent issues on how successful the 
participation of the Club of Voters in the election was.

<F P=106> [Article under the rubric ``The Journal Desk'': ``Waiting </F>
for THE COMPASS OF SCIENCE'' 
  [Text] In the next few months the international scientific 
publishing house Gordon and Breech intends to publish the new 
popular journal THE COMPASS OF SCIENCE. Initially it will be 
published every two months with a total size of 32 pages. It is 
anticipated that each issue will contain four or five main 
articles, as well as a collection of information notes on 
science news and advertising materials. 
  Prof. Gerhart Friedlender, a member of the U.S. National 
Academy of Sciences, has agreed to become the editor in chief of 
the journal. He works at Brookhaven Laboratory and is well known 
for his works in the field of nuclear physics and chemistry. 
  The list of its basic sections: physics and astronomy, 
chemistry, biology, the earth sciences, materials science, 
technology, applied mathematics and computers, power engineering 
and ecology, and medicine, testifies to the versatile nature of 
the future journal. Scientists from various countries will be 
the editors of these sections. Desiring to ensure the broadest 
possible coverage in the journal of the news of Russian science 
and striving to enlist our scientists in the description and 
analysis of their own achievements and the achievements of their 
foreign colleagues, the initiators of the publication of THE 
COMPASS OF SCIENCE additionally intend to include among the 
editors a representative of Russia--Academician Vitaliy 
Goldanskiy will be him. A Japanese scientist, apparently, will 
be another editor who represents a specific region. 
  In regard to the content, style, and format, among the 
closest analogs of the future publication it is probably 
possible to name the British journal THE NEW SCIENTIST. In the 
words of Prof. G. Friedlender, the goal of THE COMPASS OF 
SCIENCE will be ``the description of the most important 
scientific and technical research, discoveries and ideas in such 
a form that their significance and content could be understood 
and appreciated by scientists of the most different specialties. 
In other words, the news of biology should be described in such 
a way that its importance and fascination would be clear to a 
specialist in solid-state physics, an anthropologist should read 
with interest about a new approach to the problem of stellar 
evolution, and so forth.'' 
  Russian scientists will probably find something to tell the 
readers of THE COMPASS OF SCIENCE about, and the world 
scientific community will find for itself in the new journal 
many interesting notices about the achievements of science in 
our country and assessments by our scientists of foreign science 
news.

Polemics'': ``The Academy Again Demands the Blood of Saltykov''] 
txt}[Text] From what we see on television and read in the 
newspapers we know that President of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences Yuriy Osipov is extremely worried about the financial 
situation of academic science and is particularly outraged by 
the fact that in the draft of the budget for 1994 the lifeline 
of Russian basic science--the separate line ``Russian Academy of 
Sciences''--has disappeared.

Article Type:CSO 

  Yuriy Osipov blames directly for the loss of the line two 
Borises--Minister of Finance Boris Fedorov and Minister of 
Science and Technical Policy Boris Saltykov. In the opinion of 
the presidium of the RAS [Russian Academy of Sciences], which on 
14 December was set forth in the appeal of academicians to Boris 
Yeltsin, these two ministers are purposefully and systematically 
destroying the academy. The decree of the presidium of the RAS 
of 21 December contains the threat of the public impeachment of 
the mentioned Borises. 
  In the appeal to the presidium the indignant scientists 
propose to put an end to this disgrace, to transfer to the 
jurisdiction of the academy of sciences all basic research of 
the country, and to eliminate the Ministry of Science. This 
demand is being advanced by the leadership of the academy for 
far from the first time. But for the first time all this talk 
has been brought from the offices to the public at large. And, 
perhaps, for the first time the ``immortals'' are so close to 
the desired goal. The battle under the carpet has ended, war has 
been declared. 
  They are bombarding the Ministry of Science with angry 
telephone calls: ``How could you? How dare you leave academic 
science without means for existence?'' Deputy Minister Andrey 
Fonotov shrugs his shoulders in bewilderment. In his opinion, 
the panic arose due to a misunderstanding. 
  ``We thought that this problem was over long ago. For the 
new 
dummy of the budget, in which this line existed, was sent out to 
all interested departments back during the summer. And not the 
academy, but we directed the attention of the Ministry of 
Finance to this detail. The draft was very poor, we sent it off 
with a large number of critical remarks, on 28 October the 
ministry agreed with our criticism, and the line about the 
academy was returned to its legitimate place. It is strange that 
Yuriy Osipov did not try to find out from the minister of 
science the true state of affairs before scribbling one 
denunciation after another.'' 
  But, to all appearances, the president of the RAS did not 
define more precisely the state of affairs because this was not 
in his interests. The available facts force one to suppose that 
he needed a panic precisely at this, post-election moment, when 
Boris Yeltsin had announced the coming reduction of the number 
of ministries and their staffs. Panic was needed around any 
problem, be it even a nonexisting one. It is hard for us to 
believe that the leaders of the academy for all their friendly 
relations with the president and prime minister of the country 
did not have access to the latest dummy of the budget. 
  But the facts are as follows. Back on 14 September Nikolay 
Malyshev, adviser of the president of Russia for science and 
education, sent Yeltsin a note, in which what the presidium of 
the RAS is now talking about was proposed--the transfer of all 
basic science to the jurisdiction of the academy and the 
elimination of the Ministry of Science. Then the dissolution of 
the parliament occurred, and the chair of Boris Saltykov for the 
first time in many months ceased to rock. The minister of 
science as a man of the Gaydar team during this period without a 
constitution was absolutely inviolable. As soon as the election 
concluded in the way we know, the note of Malyshev with the 
presidential resolution to ``consider'' lay on the desk of Yegor 
Gaydar. 
  The suggestions of Malyshev, taken separately, could hardly 
damage the ministry--the advanced accusations did not conform 
too much to reality. The ministry was accused of the inordinate 
inflation of staffs at the moment when staffs had been reduced 
appreciably--due to low wages people are now fleeing the 
Ministry of Science. The ministry was accused of working ``in 
the old way'' and of the fact that here they were not dealing 
with anything, except for ``petty tutelage and the distribution 
of finances.'' But it is hard to call ``petty tutelage'' the 
establishment of new structures like the state science centers, 
which literally saved from collapse several tens of the largest 
scientific organizations of the country. It is hard to call work 
``in the old way'' the development of a completely new method 
for us of distributing finances with the help of scientists 
themselves--the establishment of the Russian Basic Research Fund 
is meant. This fund, incidentally, in spite of all the criticism 
leveled at it, revived much stalled research. ``Instead of 
complaining,'' one scientist said,`` we are not writing 
applications for grants.'' 
  At a pre-election meeting with scientists Boris Saltykov 
spoke about the establishment of a similar fund for humanities 
scholars, about a Technology Fund, and about the possibility of 
establishing a fund for the payment of $1,000 stipends to 
representatives of the scientific elite of the country. Now 
everything may end in failure. 
  Malyshev's proposals, which are supported by surprisingly 
similar proposals of the presidium of the RAS and have been 
multiplied by an exactly chosen moment, may thus overthrow the 
ministry that is hateful to the academy. According to 
information from the state apparatus, there is on the desk of 
Boris Yeltsin a document on the elimination of the Ministry of 
Science and the establishment in its place of a department for 
science. Which Malyshev, of course, is being appointed to head. 
Already a once former minister of science. For a whole month. 
  ``The ministry in its present form is not the most ideal 
structure for the extrication of science from a state close to 
clinical death,'' believes Aleksey Zakharov, a member of the 
Russian Consultative Council of the International Science 
Foundation and an active supporter of reforms in science, whom 
one can sooner call an opponent than an admirer of the Ministry 
of Science. ``They often and at times quite justly criticize the 
ministry. Like any Russian department, it is very slow, and any 
innovation--be it a statute on the tax benefits of international 
charitable organizations on the establishment of a new 
fund--comes to it with extreme difficulty. However, this is the 
only department that is taking steps in the correct direction, 
which is not typical of the Soviet methods of management. If the 
ministry is eliminated and the financing of basic research 
leaves the academy, the only thing for Russian scientists to do 
is to put on their mourning clothes--the hopes for the 
improvement of the situation, which as it is are small, will 
decrease practically to zero. Practical experience has shown: 
The only thing that the leadership of the RAS can do effectively 
is to beg well for money. The presidium of the academy is not 
capable of carrying out reforms that make it possible to 
preserve the scientific potential, inasmuch as any of the 
reforms weakens its power. It is capable only of dragging out 
the agony and making it irreversible.'' 
  A short addendum to this article. 
  The poor Russian Academy of Sciences, which is constantly 
crying about budgetary support, for example, has at its disposal 
several joint ventures, including together with an Austrian 
firm--the five-star Palace Hotel. Another five-star hotel is 
located on the grounds of the Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry 
of the RAS, an automobile showroon also operates there. Where 
the considerable currency assets are going is unknown. In 
particular, during a check of the Palace Hotel $860,000 in 
uncollected cash, which belong to the academy, were discovered. 
One must think that scientists did not need it very much or it 
was put aside for a rainy day.

  [Abstract] Explosive systems of the oxidizer-fuel type 
appear to be most promising from the standpoint of increased 
explosive power resulting from the supplemental interaction of 
the decomposition products of the initial explosive system. This 
non-traditional approach to the development of explosive systems 
is based on the principle of increasing explosive power not by 
any direct increase of detonation characteristics, i.e. 
synthesis of newer more powerful individual explosive 
components, but by virtue of a chemical reaction in the 
Chapman-Juge zone, thereby providing for more complete flow of 
detonation processes and directing the evolved energy towards 
completion of useful forms of explosive action. The feasibility 
of this approach has been demonstrated in another work with the 
benzotrifuroxane-hexanitroethane system, where the overall 
explosive power exceed that of each of the individual 
components. In the present work experimental data are presented 
on heats of explosion, rates of detonation, and propellent 
capabilities of an oxidizer-fuel system consisting of 
bis-(2,2,2-trinitroethyl)nitramine with supplemental oxygen 
balance, and three types of fuels: a) octagon and 
benzotrifuroxane, b) an inert organic fuel consisting of lamp 
black and ultra-finely dispersed diamond, and c) an inorganic 
fuel consisting of finely dispersed aluminum of 4-10 microns 
particle size. It was demonstrated that addition of the 
additives results in increased detonation and propellent 
capability of the composition. References 2 (Russian).

  [Abstract] Cadmium telluride has been used successfully as 
an absorptive coating on polycrystalline solar cells and as a 
buffer coating on Si and GaAs single crystals used for growing 
epitaxial HgCdTe films. In both cases high requirements are 
imposed on the structure and optical properties of the CdTe 
films. A basic technological problem lies in getting a 
stoichiometric and structurally perfect film at the lowest 
possible substrate temperatures. From an analysis of previous 
work it was concluded that an ``ideal'' process requires use of 
a beam of precipitating atoms having an energy of 5-50 eV per 
atom in order to attain high surface mobility and formation of 
dense and structurally perfect films. A recent trend in ion 
technology utilizes beams of so-called intrinsic ions having a 
high degree of ionization (1-10 percent) and relatively low 
energies (100-500 eV per ion). In this connection, one of the 
most promising methods for preparing semiconductor films appears 
to be vacuum precipitation from an ion-molecular beam. In the 
present work a study was made of the effect of the energy from a 
beam of precipitated material on the structure and optical 
properties of ion-molecular beam precipitated films of CdTe on 
glass and single crystal silicon substrates. Optimum conditions 
for obtaining precipitates of fully texturized, mirror-smooth, 
and optically perfect films were determined, and the effects of 
various interacting mechanisms of the intrinsic ions with the 
condensate on the structure and optical properties of the 
resulting films are discussed. Figures 4; references 35: 8

  [Abstract] Polymeric adsorbents are now being widely used 
to concentrate trace quantities of organic compounds in the 
atmosphere and in water. Effectiveness depends greatly on the 
adsorptive properties of the adsorbents. In a previous work a 
study was made of the adsorptive properties of domestic porous 
polymers obtained by copolymerization of styrene with divinyl 
benzene, and Tenaks-GC (poly, para-2,6-polyphenylene oxide). 
These products were found to be lacking in uniformity of 
properties from lot to lot and having low resistance to heat. In 
the present work a study was made of the adsorption properties 
of Porolas-SG-2T, a new adsorbent prepared by copolymerization 
of ethylstyrene with divinyl benzene and derivatives of 
methacrylic acid. It has a specific surface of 270 
m[.sup]2[/] per gram, 1.1 cm[.sup]3[/] per gram total pore 
volume, and 213 angstrom units average pore diameter. It was 
demonstrated that this adsorbent is more specific in interaction 
with the functional groups of simple esters, ketones, and 
especially n-alcohols, than Polysorb-1. This is evidently due to 
differences in the geometry and chemistry of the surfaces. The 
results indicate that Poroplas-SG-2T may be recommended for use 
as an adsorbent to concentrate high priority atmospheric 
contaminants. References 8: 4 Russian, 4 Western.

  [Text] This article presents data on cast fast cutting 
steels for the manufacture of high-pressure chambers and bed 
plate inserts for high-pressure equipment. 
  In the instrument industry , high-pressure chambers 35 mm in 
diameter are manufactured from VK6 alloy, and 72 mm chambers are 
made from R6M5 alloy. Bed plate inserts for high-pressure 
equipment are made from VK15 alloy. References 1 and 2 present 
basic data on the behavior of hard alloys and fast cutting 
steels in the synthesis of superhard materials. The study and 
industrial testing of cast molybde num alloys have shown that 
equipment manufactured from these alloys are completely 
functional and may replace hard alloys. [.sup]3[/] 
  The metal under study was obtained in a high-frequency 
induction furnace and poured into bars and rods.[.sup]4[/] 
The characteristics of the metal were studied after casting, 
annealing, hardening, tempering, and chemical-thermal 
processing. Cast metal costs less and has increased 
impact-fatigue durability compared to deformed metal. Cast steel 
R4M6S is chara cterized by the following chemical composition: 
1.2-1.6% C, 4.8-5.2% Cr, 6.0-6.5% Mo, 
1.2-1.4%Si, 1.2-1.7% 
V, 3-4%W; st eel R4M6K5S also contained 5% Co. 
Samples were 
also manufactured for study from a steel of this composition 
with the addition of 0.06-0.12% Ti and the same amount of 
rare-earth metal. 
  Cast steel has a porous structure with a carbide eutectic 
along the edges of the grains, at the base of which lies the 
complex carbide Me[.sup]6[/]C. There are differing 
opinions about the effect of silicon on the carbide 
phase.[.sup]3[/] The silicon grinds down the grain and 
increases the hardn ess of the steel. The tungsten and 
molybdenum content in the _a_-phase is not increased due to 
their displacement from the carbides. The silicon reduces the 
amount of residual austenite; consequently, after hardening, 
steels R4M6S and R4M6 had residual austenite contents of 
28-31% 
and 33-36% respectively. The silicon reduces the 
hardening and 
tempering temperatures by 10-15ÎC. An increase in carbon 
content in the steel leads to an increase in the carbide phase, 
the hardness, and the formation of carbide 
Me[.sup]2[/]C. 
  The formation of carbides in tungsten steels is more intense 
than in molybdenum steels, and the high carbon content in 
tungsten-molybdenum steels is desirable. The addition of 
rare-earth metals makes it possible to obtain new steel 
qualities: the rare-earth metals cause the grains to be ground 
down through the effective formation of nucleation centers. The 
effect of rare earth metals on hardness, residual austenite, and 
the impact viscosity of tungsten-molybdenum steels is similar to 
their effect on molybdenum steels.[.sup]3[/] The temperature 
_a_ -_g_ of transformations in tungsten-molybdenum steels is 
lower than in tungsten steels. 
  The compression yield limit was determined by loading and 
unloading with measurement of the residual deformation. In 
steels with cobalt, silicon and a high carbon content, the 
temperature of the formation of ledeburite was reduced; 
consequently, the hardening temperature of these steels was 
lower than in steels without cobalt, silicon, and with a low 
carbon content. 
  To establish the annealing temperature, the critical points 
Ac[.sup]1[/] and Ar were determined; 
the temperature of isothermic annealing is 840-860ÎC and 
720-740ÎC. In annealed steels the carbide phase consists of 
complex carbides of tungsten, molybdenum, chromium, and 
vanadium. The microhardness of the tungsten carbides is 
12,450-15,500 MPa. The basic properties of the steels are as 
follows.

  To optimize the hardening and tempering, samples of 
different 
sizes and shapes were used. Hardening was done at 
1190-1240ÎC in air, in oil, and after is othermic curing at 
480-620ÎC. Direct hardening in oil leads to the formation of 
cracks in the transition to thin cross sec tions. Hardening in 
air did not provide uniform hardness. Gradual hardening 
eliminated the formation of cracks and provided a high level of 
hardness. Due to the formation of the carbide phase in 
isothermic curing, the amount of residual austenite was reduced 
and was 30% in steel R4M6S as opposed to 35% for 
hardening in 
oil. Approximately the same was found in other brand s of steel. 
  After hardening from optimal temperatures, the structure was 
porous with a carbide eutectic at the edges of the grains. An 
increase in hardening temperature led to a reduction in 
hardness, but the growth of the actual grain remained virtu ally 
unchanged due to the effect of the ledeburite eutectic, which 
slowed the growth of the grain. 
  In the cast state, after annealing the amount of carbide 
phase in R4M6S steel was 20-21% with up to 92% 
tungsten, 
molybdenum, and vanadium and 50% chromium. The ferrite 
contained 50% chromium and a very small amount of the 
other 
alloy components. In cobalt steels virtually all the cobalt was 
in a solid solution and had no effect on the carbide phase. In 
the hardened state some of the carbon a nd alloy components 
entered the solid solution. The martensite contained up to 
0.6% 
C, 2.8-3.7% W, 3.6-4.8% Mo and virtually all the 
chromium and 
cobalt. Stable vanadium carbides hardly entered the solid 
solution. 
  Tempering done at 530-620ÎC made it possible to obtain a 
HRC hardness of 63-68.5 depending on the steel composition. 
Steels hardened from optimal temperatures after triple tempering 
for one hour at 540-560ÎC had the maximum hardness. The 
microstructure of the tempered steels consisted of martensite, 
carbides, and a small percentage of residual austenite. The 
structure of the tempered steels contai ned 26-30% excess 
carbide phase. Increasing the hardening temperature above the 
optimal temperature led to an increase in the degree of alloying 
of the _a_ phase. The fine-disperse vanadium carbides which 
were 
formed in tempering were near the grain edges. 
  Testing of the steels for stabilization of the austenite 
showed that untempered samples became stable in 4-8 hours in 
the area of the martensite transformation. To avoid austenite 
stabilization, parts should be tempered immediately after 
hardening. 
  In order to increase the operating capacity of chambers and 
protect them from the effects of high temperatures, they were 
subjected to boronizing in the smelt stage at a temperature of 
950-1000ÎC for eight hours. After boronizing the chambers 
were placed in a bath for final quenching and after curing they 
were gradually hardened with subsequent triple tempering. The 
structure of the boronized layer was spiny, in contrast to 
deformed steels with a granular structure.[.sup]5[/] 
  Industrial testing of the set of high-pressure chambers and 
bed plate inserts of cast tungsten-molybdenum steels for 
high-pressure equipment revealed a stability no lower than that 
of hard alloys. The chambers and equipment that had undergone 
boronizing had a higher stability. The R4M6S and R4M6K6S steels 
alloyed with rare earth metals exhibited a rather high stability. 
  Conclusions. Cast tungsten-molybdenum steels with 
rare-earth metals have a high level of hardness, are durable, 
and are thermal shock resistant. Transformations which occurred 
during thermal processing were studied. The main properties of 
the steels and the annealing, hardening, tempering and 
boronizing processing of the steels were determined. The 
experimental steels withstood the cyclic loading described above 
and were found to be suitable for the manufacture of 
high-pressure chambers and bed plate inserts used in the 
synthesis of ultrahard materials.

  [Abstract] The objective of the article is to develop 
methods for identification and optimum control of fuzzy systems 
and using the methods in an existing coking process. Equations 
for identification of fuzzy functional and dynamic systems are 
derived. Theorems on the exact solution of fuzzy equations are 
given (without proof). Equations describing optimum control of 
fuzzy dynamic systems are presented. The results were used for 
identification and optimum control of a coking process 
(processing of heavy residual oil for producing oil coke). The 
method proposed for systems described with fuzzy difference 
equations is based on minimizing a fuzzy functional using 
regular and expanded arithmetics operations. To solve 
identification problems for systems described with fuzzy 
relational equations it is proposed to use an identification 
method based on exact solution of fuzzy relational equations. 
The method for optimum control of systems with a fuzzy criterion 
is based on modification of a fuzzy analog of the dynamic 
programming method for deterministic systems with fuzzy control 
restrictions. The proposed method was used for developing a 
fuzzy model of the coking process and for stating and solving 
the problem of termination control of the coking process.

  [Abstract] The article examines a method for segmentation 
and analysis of a class of multidimensional images characterized 
by a statistical relationship between the observed value of one 
component and validity of the estimate of the value of another 
component. Such relationsip is typical for multi-dimensional 
speckle images formed using remote sensing means. The proposed 
method makes it possible to use a common approach to the 
segmentation procedure, regardless of peculiarities of physical 
processes of formation of analyzed images. A formula for the 
decision rule for image segmentation based on the maximum a 
posteriori probability criterion in the case of a normal 
distribution of parameter estimates is derived. The algorithm 
output is not only a segmented image, but also characteristics 
of each identified area, so the algorithm makes it possible to 
analyze the initial scene. Figures 6, references 16.

large systems. The problem of developing a short range AMC is 
stated and solved for the developmental design proposal stage. 
The process of computer aided design of an anti-aircraft complex 
includes sequential solution of problems of synthesizing the AMC 
image and analysis of resulting AMC configurations. The article 
describes the structure of the CAD system, as well as its 
hardware and software. The software for simulation of the AMC 
and its major subsystems is also described in great detail. The 
AMC CAD system was used for a number of practical calculations 
investigating the prospects for development and analysis of 
effectiveness of various configurations of a short range AMC. 
The use of the AMC CAD system made it possible to substantially 
increase the number of alternative AMC versions analyzed during 
the development process, which improved the quality of the 
design output. The system can be used by a research engineer who 
does not know programming languages but knows AMC design methods 
and procedures. Figures 13, references 23.

  [Abstract] Formation of lateral-shear interferograms by 
double-exposure holography is examined and spatial filtration 
enhancing the interference immunity of this process is proposed, 
a diffusely scattered field being used for monitoring wave 
aberration of lenses and objects. Objects with larger focal 
lengths require larger-size and thus less interference-immune 
holographic apparatus, the purpose of spatial filtration being 
to overcome the resulting difficulty. In the first exposure a 
matted screen the incident converging beam of coherent light has 
a quasi-spherical waveform with a radius of curvature equal to 
the distance d[.sup]1[/] from the monitored lens 
L[.sup]1[/] with a focal length f[.sub]1[/] &gt; 
d[.sup]1[/]) and the hologram of diffusely scattered field 
monitoring this lens is recorded by a quasi-plane reference 
wave. Then, prior to the second exposure, the matted screen is 
shifted in its plane through a distance z along say the x-axis 
axis and the monitored lens is shifted in its principal (x[.sup]2[/],y 
[.sup]2[/]) plane in the same direction through a 
distance equal to zf[.sup]1[/]/d[.sub]1[/]. Reconstruction 
of the thus recorded double-exposure hologram with a copy of the 
reference wave gives rise to a diffraction field whose complex 
amplitude is describable in the Fresnel approximation. The 
amplitude distribution of this field will be modified by 
placement of a filtering second lens with a focal length 
f[.sup]2[/] in the plane of the hologram. Its new 
distribution indicates that the subjective speckle fields 
appearing as a result of two exposures will coincide in the 
plane in which the image of the matted screen is formed. Such 
double-exposure holograms were recorded experimentally with 630 
nm light from a He-Ne laser on Micrat BRL photographic plates, 
the focal length of the first lens being varied over the 180-500 
mm range and that of the second lens over the 15-30 mm range.

  [Abstract] Synthesis of an optimum magnetic system for 
magnetic resonance imagers is considered, namely maximizing the 
size of the region of a highly uniform polarizing magnetic field 
with the minimum number of coils having equal inside diameters 
and carrying currents of the same density. The conventional 
method of such a synthesis is expanding the magnetic induction 
into a Taylor series and subsequently selecting system 
parameters which minimize several first terms of the series so 
as to ensure that the deviation from field uniformity will not 
exceed typically the 10[.sup]-5[/] % order of magnitude. 
Regions with smaller deviation are obviously smaller. A 
fourth-order and thus simplest magnetic system consisting of two 
Helmholtz coils is inadequate for this application, because the 
region with an even larger (10[.sup]-4[/] %) permissible 
deviation from field uniformity is too small. In use are now a 
sixth-order magnetic system of four coils (U.S. patent No. 
4276529, 1981), compensated solenoids with a sixth-order outside 
groove (Ravi Kumar and P. Chaddan in Cryogenics Vol. 27, 1987), 
and an eighth-order magnetic system with three circuits (FRG 
patent No. 35 17818). Even in these systems is the region of 
uniform magnetic field still not large enough, unless they have 
a large inside diameter but then so is their weight and power 
requirement. A better alternative is shown to be a tenth-order 
magnetic system with only three equally spaced solenoids having 
equal inside diameters and wound with rectangular conductors, a 
longer one with a smaller outside diameter between two identical 
shorter ones with larger outside diameters along the common 
axis. The method of Taylor series expansion is applied here to 
the longitudinal component of magnetic induction at any point a 
distance z away from the axis of a solenoid with an inside 
radius R and a length L. The geometry of the central solenoid is 
characterized by two dimensionless parameters 
a[.sup]1[/],b[.sub]1[/]. The two lateral solenoids are 
regarded as the difference between two solenoids with 
dimensionless geometrical parameters 
a[.sup]2[/],b[.sub]3[/] and a[.sub]2[/], b[.sub]2[/] 
respectively. Such a magnetic system is thus characterized by 
five dimensionless design parameters. With the value of 
a[.sup]1[/] (or any one of the other parameters) specified, 
the other four are evaluated as polynomial functions of that 
one. This has been done numerically for a[.sup]1[/]= 1.1, 
with each of the other four parameters expressed as complete 
fifth-degree polynomial in a[.sup]1[/]- 1 with a free term 
each. On this basis has been built a resistive MR imager with a 
two-loop water cooling system. The solenoids are wound with 
tubular rectangular conductors, the central one having 10 layers 
of 72 turns and each lateral having 14 layers of 29 turns, for a 
nominal magnetic induction of 0.1 T and an operating current of 
111 A. The inside diameter and the total length are 71 cm and 
176.8 cm respectively, the larger outside diameter being 87.3 
cm. The diameter of the active region with a less than 
10[.sup]-5[/] % deviation from field uniformity is 52 cm. 
The imager weighs 800 kg and draws a power of 39 kW.

  [Abstract] An information and measurement system is 
considered which includes K[.sup]o[/] observers, each with 
K[.sup]s[/] opto-electronic scanners on board moving in 
space. A set of objects is assumed to be moving in space in a 
known manner, some of them having been already observed earlier 
and the pertinent data recorded in a special catalog. The 
remainder of them has not yet been logged. The observation time 
is subdivided into into equally long periods. It is furthermore 
assumed that, by a preliminary processing of the readings taken 
by one scanner, it is possible to estimate the state vector of a 
given object at the beginning of an observation period and 
evaluate the covariance matrix of the estimation error. There 
arises the problem of identifying the readings, namely of 
referring each to objects in the catalog or to one of the new 
objects, or to the set of spurious ones. Because an object can 
give more than one reading, it is expedient to tackle this 
problem by solving the relevant sequence of destinations 
problems where the set of readings taken within one observation 
period has been broken down into those three subsets and each of 
the identification hypotheses defined accordingly. The problem 
of identifying the set of readings taken within one observation 
period can thus be reduced to the problem of maximizing a 
certain functional which is defined on the set of all hypotheses 
and is proportional to the probability of the given one. The 
exponential dependence of the total number of hypotheses on the 
number M of measurements and on the number N of objects already 
in the catalog makes the identification problem so unwieldy that 
complete sifting through the hypotheses is not always feasible. 
A simpler procedure is, therefore, proposed: sifting the 
hypotheses in two stages, with fewer hypotheses to be sifted in 
each stage. In the first stage the entire set of known objects 
is subdivided into groups (``clusters''), namely into components 
of connectedness on a bilobate graph where the vertices 
represent all known objects and readings. Arcs are drawn to 
connect vertices when distances between them are smaller than a 
given threshold length. In the second stage the series of 
identification problems is solved separately for each cluster. 
Because one object can give more than one reading, a heuristic 
multistep algorithm is required for this procedure. The cost 
matrix in the destinations problems is best evaluated by the 
Monte Carlo method. The proposed procedure was tested on the 
following practical case: N= 2K[.sup]o[/]K[.sub]s[/], 
number of objects detected within one observation period 
N[.sup]o[/] ˜ 0.1N, number of objects detected by several 
scanners N[.sup](ss)[/] ˜ 0.1N, one scanner detecting 1-10 
objetcs, number of scanners which detect objects during an 
observation period K[.sup]d[/] ˜ 0.1K, number of new 
objects N[.sup]n[/] ˜ N. References 3.

  [Abstract] Synthesis of optimal control, being a dynamic 
problem of optimization, is solved in closed form for an 
autonomous control system in the general case of a nonlinear one 
with an additive re-entrant control vector dx/dt= f(x(t)) + 
Bu(t). It is assumed that the mechanical control object f(x(t)) 
has a vector of independent first integrals which obeys 
Pontryagin's principle condition and that the control vector is 
subject to an upper-bound constraint on its Euclidean norm. With 
x(t(0)) and x(t(1)) given in the phase space, the problem is to 
find the structure of operator u[.sup]0[/]= 
u[.sup]0[/](x(t)) which will minimize the time functional 
Ì= [.sup]t0[/]Int[.sup]t1[/] dt= t(1) - t(0) to minÌ= 
T[.sup]0[/](x(t)). The solution to this variational problem 
is sought on the basis of the characteristic optimality 
condition in the quick-response problem. That minimum and thus 
optimum value is shown to depend not only on the vector of 
optimal control but also on the intrinsic motion of the control 
object (solution to the problem) under specific initial or 
current conditions in phase coordinates. The characteristic 
optimality condition is applied to the case of an object either 
in intrinsic motion or at rest, with a zero Euclidean norm of 
the control vector and no a'priori information about control of 
the object before time t[.sup]0[/]. A partial differential 
equation of the Hamilton-Jacobi kind and the solution to its 
Cauchy problem with a zero boundary condition are obtained for 
T[.sup]0[/]. For autonomous systems that equation is a 
quasi-linear first-order partial differential one solvable by 
the method of characteristics, the latter being solutions to a 
system of ordinary differential equations. In the particular 
case considered here the integral surface degenerates into an 
integral curve, the tangent plane into a tangent line, and the 
Monge cone into a Monge axis. As a specific example is 
considered motion describable by the system of two equations 
dx(1)/dt= x(2) + u(1) and dx(2)/dt= -x(1) + u(2) with the same 
upper-bound constraint on the norms of both control vectors.

  [Abstract] The existence of purely transverse acoustic 
waves along the boundary of two isotropic half-spaces first 
described in Akusticheskiy zhurnal Vol. 24 No. 4, 
1978 is discussed, and it is noted that if both half-spaces are 
piezoelectric crystals, a purely acoustoelectric wave may 
propagate along their acoustic contact boundary without an 
intermediate layer. An attempt is made to demonstrate that a new 
type of purely transverse wave may propagate parallel to the 
acoustic contact planes of two piezoelectric 43m crystals 
whereby the acoustoelectric field is localized in the 
near-contact layer whose thickness is on the order of the 
wavelength, i.e., the wave amplitude attenuate on either side of 
the contact boundary equally as fast as in ordinary Rayleigh 
waves. The structure of the purely acoustoelectric Stonley wave 
is plotted. The source data and the outcome of acoustoelectric 
parameter analysis of the new type of purely acoustoelectric 
waves for such contacting piezoelectric crystal pairs as GaAs 
with ViGeO[.sup]20[/], InSb with InAs, ViGeO[.sub]20[/] 
with ZnS, ViGeO[.sup]20[/] with InAs, GaAs with Si, ZnS with 
Si, and ViGeO[.sup]20[/] with Si are summarized. It is shown 
that the use of the new type of purely acoustoelectric waves 
whose existence is predicted in the article may be promising in 
monolithic integrated acoustoelectronics for developing 
functional devices with a latent acoustic channel, e.g., active 
and passive acoustic waveguides without losses, multilayer delay 
lines, acoustoelectric amplifiers and generators, convolvers, 
etc. Figures 2; tables 2; references 4: 2 Russian, 2 Western.

  [Abstract] The inadequacy of the semi-empirical simplified 
models used to describe the resist relief evolution for 
simulating submicrometer lithography due to the assumption that 
the local polymer resist dissolution rate depends only on the 
mean value of the polymer's molecular mass prompted a new look 
at the process of selective polymer dissolution. In so doing, 
resist development is considered as a selective polymer 
dissolution process, and the diffusion origin of the selective 
polymer dissolution process, mass transfer in the 
polymer-gel-liquid solution system with selective dissolution, 
and nonselective dissolution are examined in detail. The 
concentration distribution evolution of monodisperse polystyrene 
in methylethylketone in a film, the development profiles of 
polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) in methylisobutylketone (MBIK) and 
of polystyrene in methylethylketone, and the dependence of the 
critical groove size in the swelling polystyrene 
(PST)-methylethylketone (MEK) system on the initial 
polydispersity degree are plotted; the above description of 
selective polymer dissolution as an evolution of the spatial 
molecular and mass distribution (allowing for the dependence of 
the transport properties of the macromolecules on their size) 
makes it possible to simulate the process of slightly 
(PMMA-MIBK) and highly (PST-MEK) swelling polymer resist 
composition development and shows that the proposed model is 
suitable for describing the development process with the 
fullness required by submicrometer lithography. The findings 
demonstrate that by properly selecting the molecular and mass 
distribution of the polymer base, one can increase the resist 
composition resolution. Figures 4; references 8: 6 Russian, 2

  [Abstract] The principal active element of GaAs integrated 
circuits--a field effect transistor with a Shottky barrier or 
p-n junction serving as the control barrier 
junction--is described, and the constraints imposed by the 
presence of the gate-source barrier junction are discussed. A 
method is proposed for limiting the gate current in field effect 
transistors with a barrier junction which amounts to using a 
composite transistor produced by inversely connecting the gate 
and source electrodes of two like transistors whereby the 
auxiliary transistor is connected to the gate circuit of the 
main transistor so that when the composite transistor's 
gate-source voltage rises, the main transistor's gate-source 
voltage rises but the auxiliary transistor's gate-source voltage 
decreases; the auxiliary transistor is cut off before a 
measurable current appears in the main transistor gate circuit 
under certain conditions. The use of composite FETs makes it 
possible to expand the functional capabilities of digital IC 
logic elements and lower their electric power consumption; their 
shortcomings include a certain decrease in response speed due to 
the use of additional auxiliary transistor elements in the 
switched transistor gate circuits. This drawback is partially 
compensated for by the bootstrap effect and automatic negative 
voltage level limiting. Figures 4; references 4.

  [Abstract] Recovery of the amorphized silicon crystal 
lattice at an annealing temperature below the melting point by 
the solid phase epitaxial recrystallization mechanism (TFER) and 
the attendant complex processes of impurity atom redistribution 
and embedding, point defect and capture center generation, etc., 
are discussed, and an attempt is made to examine solid phase 
epitaxial recrystallization in amorphized silicon layers with 
ion-implanted Sm and Yb. These rare earth metal (RZE) impurities 
were selected due to their low solubility in silicon and, 
consequently, the low concentration of active atoms. KDB-12 
&lt;100&gt;  Si slices were used as the source material, and [.sup]152[/] 

Sm[.sup]+[/] and [.sup]174[/] 
Yb[.sup]+[/] ions were implanted in a 
Vezuviy-5 unit. The samples were annealed in an atmosphere of 
nitrogen. The solid phase epitaxial recrystallization processes 
were studied by the methods of Rutherford's backscattering (ROR) 
using primary [.sup]4[/]He[.sup]+[/] ions with a 1,500 keV 
energy and secondary ion mass spectrometry (VIMS) in an IMS-3F 
unit; the backscattered ions were recorded by a solid state 
semiconductor detector with a 17 keV energy resolution, and the 
primary O[.sup]2[/][.sup]+[/] ion beam with an 8 keV 
energy and 1-2 ÊA current was scanned into a 0.5x0.5 mm 
pattern. Rutherford backscattering spectra and Sm and Yb 
concentration profiles in ion-implanted Si samples are plotted, 
and the ion implantation and heat treatment conditions are 
summarized. The study shows that after the heat treatment, the 
impurity distribution is characterized by three types of peaks; 
on the surface, slightly off-surface in the case of incomplete 
recrystallization, and on the boundary between the amorphized 
layer and crystal substrate. The effect of impurities on the 
recrystallization rate, i.e., the solid phase epitaxial 
recrystallization front velocity, is examined: given a 470ÎC 
annealing temperature, it is equal to 0.9+/-0.1 nm/min for Sm 
and 1.7+/-0.1 nm/mm for Yb, which is grater than that of 
Si[.sup]+[/]-implantation by three- and sixfold, 
respectively. The characteristics of ion-implanted rare earth 
elements in Si during heat treatment may be used in 
semiconductor technology for producing heat- and 
radiation-resistant semiconductors, getter areas, small 
p-n-junctions, and other applications. The authors 
are grateful to Yu.A. Klimov for constructive discussions.

  [Abstract] The proliferation of ship-borne and coastal 
radar (RLS) used at very low grazing angles resulting is surface 
shadowing in addition to space and airborne radar operating at 
medium and small angles of incidence and the shortcomings of 
existing approaches of solving the problem of echo signal 
spectrum at small grazing angles prompted the development of a 
new approach which is suitable for finding any statistical 
characteristic of a random moving surface allowing for blockage. 
The approach is first tested on a simple model and then applied 
to the case of sea waves. The approach thus makes it possible to 
treat the undulating sea surface as a superposition of traveling 
plane waves with random amplitudes and determine its effective 
statistical characteristics. Since available computer facilities 
are too slow and inadequate for parallel calculations, the new 
approach is based on taking blockage into account for each term, 
than adding up the results. The proposed algorithm is a 
combination of precise and approximate approaches and makes it 
possible to consider moving surfaces and find any statistical 
characteristic allowing for blockage as well as plot the 
distribution function, resulting in a precise solution. It is 
expected that the algorithm will be used to find the spectrum of 
the echo from the sea surface at small grazing angles. The 
author is grateful to M.B. Kanevskiy for constructive 
discussions. Figures 5; references 11: 10 Russian, 1 Western.

  [Abstract] The importance of understanding the radiothermal 
radiation characteristics of the earth's covers in the 
millimeter wavelength band (EHF) in a number of applied tasks of 
natural resource management and remote sensing by radiophysical 
methods prompted a study of the quantitative effect of the 
surface irregularities, dielectric constant, and atmospheric 
conditions on the polarization characteristics of radiothermal 
radiation of the earth's covers without vegetation. To this end, 
an analytical procedure is developed, and the effective 
temperatures of exposed soils are calculated for horizontal and 
vertical polarization as a function of the wavelength, relative 
bulk moisture content, and averaged geometrical parameters of 
these underlying surface irregularities for the pure atmosphere 
and planostratus clouds. The effect of bulk scattering in the 
EHF band is ignored, and uniform, generally flat, horizontal 
surface segments covered by chaotic irregularities whose 
dielectric constant does not depend on the coordinates are 
considered assuming that the size of the segment forming the 
emitted field greatly exceeds the correlation radius of the 
irregularity height while the radiating atmosphere is a uniform 
horizontal formation. The dependence of the effective soil 
temperature on the zenith angle and relative bulk moisture 
content and the dependence of the sandy soil's polarization 
invariant on the zenith angle are plotted. The findings make it 
possible to determine the relative effect of various factors on 
each cover's effective temperature for orthogonal polarization 
and measure the soils' range of radiance temperatures at various 
external conditions at 1.4-1.8 mm wavelengths. It is noted that 
in determining the thermodynamic surface temperature from the 
measured effective temperature by the above method for 
orthogonal polarization, the surface roughness parameters and 
atmospheric conditions must be taken into account; otherwise, an 
error on the order of 10% may be expected within a 
2.2-8.6 mm 
band which corresponds to a 30K error. Figures 5; tables 1; 
references 7: 6 Russian, 1 Western.

  [Abstract] The numerous inhomogeneities which characterize 
real complex obstacles and distinguish them from circular 
cylinders and make it difficult to simulate them by a circular 
cylinder irradiated with an electromagnetic wave, i.e., a 
longitudinal recess or a sectorial cut, necessitated an analysis 
of the backscattering cross section on the basis of a strict 
solution of the problem of electromagnetic wave field scattering 
by a circular infinitely long cylinder with a sectorial cut and 
by a sectorial cylinder which may be used for simulating a 
bilocal polygon; it is assumed that the cylinder is a perfect 
conductor with an exp(-i_o_t) behavior. The problem 
is solved in a _r_, Ì, z cylindrical system of 
coordinates; the dependence of the sectorial cylinder's 
backscattering coefficient on the relative diameter and angular 
cut dimension for E and H-polarization is 
plotted. The findings are compared to a plane tape and circular 
cylinder, and it is shown that the effect of the cut depends on 
the wave polarization; this is manifested by the oscillating 
behavior of backscattering. The author is grateful to V.P. 
Shestopalov and B.Z. Katsenelenbaum for constructive remarks and 
discussions. Figures 2; references 7.

  [Abstract] Interference methods and results of computing 
interference contrast and the corresponding errors in light 
reading in the case of a scalar wave field, depending on the 
characteristic of the entirely coherent low-order Gaussian beam 
are discussed in this article. It is assumed that the Fresnel 
coefficients are invariant and that the reflection from an 
inclined angle of incidence on the edge of the sample produces 
no phase shifting. Results of numerical computations for 
semi-conductor plates are provided. It is demonstrated that the 
interference intensity in the examined case is determined by a 
particular thickness of the plate and its effective coefficient 
of reflection. Curves of the interference contrast as a function 
of the sample thickness for different values of the effective 
reflection coefficient, and the relationship between the maximum 
relative light reading error and light transmissions by the 
plate were obtained. Figures 3, references 9 Russian

  [Abstract] Interference-optical methods for information 
processing dealing with space-time parameters of several 
physical phenomena are examined. The information is in the form 
of a universal optical signal - interference pattern. In 
addition to examining the traditional methods of processing the 
interference pattern, methods, based on supplementary modulation 
in time and space, are also examined along with methods of 
spatial frequency measurements. Some new phase measuring methods 
are proposed and areas of their practical application are 
pointed out. An example of a digital analysis of interference 
pattern, which has a practical significance, is provided.

  [Abstract] Experimental realization of a laser beam 
diffraction on micro-transparancies of synthesized interference 
pattern with a 1.5 mm diameter indicates that in the Frauenhofer 
diffraction region, the wave field has a pseudo-caustic 
character exhibiting a characteristic flare and cell structure. 
This constitutes an experimental proof of the fact, that for the 
focusing systems with a meridional aberration of the third order 
coma, the caustic diffraction fields, produced in the focal 
plane, and complex interference fields, formed in the Twyman- 
Green interferometer and describing the deviation of the 
converging wave front from the reference sphere, are 
qualitatively related by the Fourier transform. Figures 4, 
references 13: 7 Russian, 6 Western.

  [Abstract] Fundamental characteristics of optical 
electronic neural network on a holographic photo-thermoplastic 
disk are examined. Based on the method of simultaneous local 
hologram recording on a photo-thermoplastic (PTP) disk with 
infra-red laser heating, and a method of automatic recording of 
two- dimensional Fourier holograms with uniform characteristics 
over the entire PTP surface and control of the recording process 
by a personal computer, a PTP disk with a holographic recording 
was developed. A picture of the PTP disk is shown, and the 
optical vector-matrix multiplication process is described. 
Information recording density of 
2x10[.sup]5[/]bit/mm[.sup]2[/] was experimentally obtained 
by this method. It can provide a 1 Gbit capacity of the 
holographic PTP disk with a 133 mm diameter. Diffraction 
effectiveness, obtained for Fourier hologram digital information 
with a diameter of 1 mm, was 5% while signal-to- noise 
ratio 
was not smaller than 70:1. Prospects of developing an 
optical-electronic neural network (OENN) using a holographic 
disk (HD) in systems for optical information processing appear 
to be the most attractive. The accuracy and speed of signal 
processing with the OENN-HD system is analyzed. Comparison 
between the best electronic neural computers indicates that the 
OENN-HD parameters are not inferior to the parameters of the 
multiprocessor computing system ``Connection Machine-2'' Figures

  [Abstract] Results are described in this article of studies 
dealing with the optical amplification in amorphous photopolymer 
materials GFPM-633 which exhibit a high sensitivity in the red 
spectral region. The material is designed for recording phase 
holograms by the He-Ne laser radiation (_l_=632.8 nm). The 
experiments on optical amplification were made with a 
holographic apparatus using a series produced LG-52-1 laser. The 
dynamics of diffraction efficiency at _l_=760 nm for recording 
with optical amplification on photopolymer material GFPM-633-2 
is shown in a graph. For this type of material, the gain was in 
the 2-60 range. Holographic characteristics were also obtained 
for this material. The relationships of the initial, final and 
corrected diffraction efficiency as a function of the initial 
time of exposure for the 632.8 nm wavelength are also provided. 
The gain corresponding to the diffraction efficiency curves is 
also shown in the graphs. The mechanism of optical amplification 
in the photopolymer material is discussed. Figures 6, references

  [Abstract]The effects were examined of low temperature 
annealing (T&lt;100Î)of chemically deposited PbS layers in an 
oxygen containing medium and in a vacuum, on the spectrum and 
value of photosensitivity, dark resistance, noise, etc. It was 
demonstrated that there exist a simultaneous close correlation 
between dark conduction of samples and their photoconduction. 
This correlation is explained by the charge transfer mechanism 
in media with strong spacial fluctuations of conduction. In view 
of the fact that despite strong changes in the photosensitivity 
value no significant changes occurred in the photoconduction 
spectrum during the process of low temperature annealing, it may 
be concluded that the absorption coefficient is not changing. 
Changes occur in the product of the parameters Ê_t_, where 
Ê 
is the conduction and _t_ is the life-time of the 
nonequilibrium 
carriers. In order to uncover which is the most contributing 
factor in the photoconduction changes: changes in the transport 
properties of the carriers, which affect the dark conduction, or 
changes in the life-time of nonequilibrium carriers, the dark 
conduction of samples and their photoconduction, as well as the 
photoconduction and the life-time of the nonequilibrium carriers 
was examined. These parameters were measured in a lot of samples 
with a large distribution of the photoconduction value. Samples 
with a higher conduction exhibited a higher photoconduction.

  [Abstract] Organic lightsensitive material GFPM-633, 
designed for recording phase holograms in a real time mode by 
He- Ne laser radiation (_l_=632.8nm) with diffraction 
efficiency 
upto 90% has been developed. Results are provided on 
reconstruction experience of phase holograms using this 
material. It is pointed out that it has a 20mJ/cm[.sup]2[/] 
sensitivity, for 50% diffraction efficiency and the 
features of 
the recording mechanism are examined. It is determined that the 
material does not provide a high diffraction efficiency of the 
recorded holograms for a long time. The feasibility is 
demonstrated of recording on this material Fourier holograms of 
test images with a diffraction efficiency 9-15% and 50:1 
average contrast of the image and also with 10 superimposed 
holograms. One possible application area of the examined 
photopolymer materials (PPM) lies in producing phase copies of 
amplitude templets of synthesized holographic elements. 
Experience of working with the PPM demonstrated the feasibility 
of efficient application of theses materials for model 
experiments on holographic interferometry and for optical 
information processing. Figures 6, references 14: 7 Russian, 7

  [Abstract] Experiments performed with PbS samples for 
finding the parameters which determine the motion parameters and 
recombination of the carriers, as well as the value of the PbS 
photosensitive layers as a function of temperature, demonstrated 
that the behavior of the photoconductivity temperature curves in 
the low temperature region is determined by the mobility 
temperature of the charge carriers, and in the high temperature 
region is determined by exponential dependence on the life-time 
temperature of nonequilibrium carriers. Depending on the 
technology of the substrate preparation before the 
photosensitive layers are deposited, the surface condition at 
the interface between the film and the substrate can play a role 
in the recombination process. If the surface recombination is 
increased, the life-time of the nonequilibrium carriers and the 
mobility is decreased, and the temperature dependence of the 
photoconductivity is changed. Figures 4, references 6: 5

  [Abstract] Light beam splitters for formation of three- 
dimensional interconnection, employing planar lightguides based 
on the effect of total internal reflection, and holographic 
arrays for the radiation input and output are examined in this 
paper. Single-beam arrays for input and output, as well as 
multiple-beam arrays are discussed and their characteristics are 
compared. It is demonstrated that in such microcircuits the 
application of multiple-beam arrays for radiation output is 
preferable, because when the light losses in the hologram 
materials are taken into account, they provide a significantly 
greater efficiency of utilizing the light source power than the 
single-beam arrays. When the coefficient of light attenuation is 
3dB/cm, splitters with a N=1024 output beams and a laser power 
efficiency of 50% can be produced using the multiple beam 
arrays. Figures 3, tables 2, references 6: 1 Russian, 5 Western

  [Abstract] Polarization-anisotropic (PA) light scattering, 
i.e. scattering with polarization rotation exhibited in the 
ferroelectric crystals is examined. The dynamic model of the PO 
scattering is qualitatively substantiated and the physical model 
of this phenomenon in the LiNbO[.sup]3[/] is clarified. Data 
are provided demonstrating a significant difference in the 
development of the polarization anisotropic (PA) and 
polarization isotropic (PI) time characteristics. For the 
PA-scattering, a long lasting time delay of the beginning of 
development and longer times (by the factor of 5-10) of reaching 
the equilibrium state are typical. In the proposed model, the PA 
scattering is related to the noise of the fluctuating fields, 
perpendicular to the Z axis, which are induced by the 
photo-galvanic current flowing parallel to the Z axis. Light, 
scattered by the noise field, undergoes a non-steady state 
holographic amplification. The holograms are recorded due to 
interaction between the beams of PA and PI-scattering and the 
fundamental beam. It was demonstrated that in the case of 
PA-scattering, the holographic gratings can also act as the 
scattering centers. The latter are recorded by the beams of the 
PA-scattering, while the Braggs conditions are fulfilled only 
for the fundamental beam. The experimental data indicate that 
hologram recording in the LiNbO[.sup]3[/] can occur only due 
to the scalar interference. Reasons causing the scattering of 
the regular wave into an irregular wave and vice versa are 
discussed. Figures 6, references 7 Russian

  [Abstract] The photo-electric linkages between the matrix 
elements of photodetectors made with GaAs and InP, which are the 
most common of the A[.sup]III[/]B[.sup]V[/] compounds. For 
determination of the coefficient of photoelectric linkage 
K[.sup]c[/], current I[.sub]Ì[/] was measured by 
illuminating the examined photodetector matrix. Next, the 
photodetector was covered by a light-tight screen and its 
current value was measured when the adjoining photodetector was 
illuminated. The value of K[.sup]c[/] was determined from 
equation K[.sup]c[/]=I[.sub]c[/]/I[.sub]Ì[/]. 
Spectral measurements were performed with a diffraction 
monochromator MDR- 23. The results of this study indicate that 
the diffusion length of the minor charge carriers is the 
parameter of the material, which significantly affects the value 
of K[.sup]c[/]. It was demonstrated that in the high 
sensitivity spectral region, the curve of K[.sup]c[/] as a 
function of the substrate thickness has a maximum, whose value 
depends on the relationship between the absorption depth and the 
radiation wavelength. It was established that the spectral 
characteristic of the coefficient K[.sup]c[/] of the GaAs and 
InP photo matrices is shifted to the shortwave spectral region, 
compared to silicon. Figures 5, references 9: 2 Russian, 7 
Western.

  [Abstract] A new approach is examined for designing 
parallel specialized photo-matrix LSIC, employing 
metal-dielectric- semiconductor (MDS) technology, capable of not 
only reception, photoelectric conversion and storage of logic 
signals, but their parallel logic-arithmetic processing as well. 
The results are reported of a new photo-matrix LSIC PMAMD 
(Photo-Matrix Associative Memory Device) for realization of 
parallel data search methods from optical memory organized by 
pages. High speeds of photoelectric transformation of the data 
of optical pages and their parallel processing is successfully 
combined in this LSIC with a high reliability and interference 
rejection of photoelectric transformation during the data flow, 
divergence of optical parameters of the page images, 
nonuniformity of the light background, electrophysical 
parameters of the photoelectronic LSIC crystals, and also 
nonuniformities produced by technology of the LSIC 
manufacturing. The structural diagram of the proposed 
photoelectronic LSIC PMAMD is provided. Testing of experimental 
samples of the PMAMD demonstrated that with the optical signal 
power 5x10[.sup]-8[/]W/Bit, the photo-sensitivity of the 
PMAMD elementary cells (not less than 10[.sup]-13[/], can 
produce a 100 Mbit/s rate of the data flow at the optical input 
to the PMAMD . Figures 5, references 20: 17 Russian, 3 Western

  [Abstract] A solution was obtained for the problem of 
electro-optic interaction of the fundamental mode of a channel 
waveguide with the field produced by electrodes. Generalized 
variables were used for the solution. Computations were made for 
one of the most promising class of integrated optical devices - 
modulators on ferro-electric LiNbO[.sup]3[/] type crystals, 
where the wave structure is formed by diffusion of additives 
from the applied thin film. Based on the analysis of the 
solution, the combination was found of the waveguide - electrode 
system parameters, which provide the least possible half-wave 
voltages U[.sup]„[/]. It was established that the factor 
theoretically limiting from below the U[.sup]„[/] values in 
the red and infrared spectrum region is the maximum value of the 
increment of the refraction index attainable in a diffusion 
waveguide. The relationship of the minimal U[.sup]„[/] as a 
function of _l_ was constructed for the Ti:LiNbO[.sup]3[/] 
waveguides. Introduction of a buffer layer does not change 
qualitatively the results of the analysis. Figures 8, table 1, 
references 19: 7 Russian, 12 Western.

  [Abstract] A feasibility is demonstrated for developing a 
converter of a monochromatic light beam into a line of parallel 
light beams of identical intensity. A three-dimensional divider 
of the monochromatic radiation was examined here. This divider 
can be useful for the development of three-dimensional 
integrated-optical circuits. The proposed device includes a 
waveguide, and input and output diffraction gratings. Planar 
waveguides, obtained by diffusion of silver ions into an oxide 
glass substrate, were used. The input and output elements of the 
demultiplier consist of a thin relief type diffraction grating. 
The elements were prepared by projecting the interference 
pattern produced by crossed beams of argon laser, on the 0.4 - 
0.6Êm thick As[.sup]2[/]S[.sub]3[/] films, sputtered by 
a thermal evaporation in a vacuum. After exposure, the 
diffraction efficiency (DE) increased during the transformation 
process of the grating structure. For an effective performance 
of the device, the input grating must have a maximum possible 
value of the DE. In the experiments performed here, the DE was 
on the order of 50%. Figures 2, references 8: 5 Russian, 3

  [Abstract] Some features of recording medium behavior in 
multi-layer recording devices are examined. At the present time, 
halogen-silver photo-emulsion is the only material exhibiting a 
10[.sup]-4[/] - 10[.sup]-5[/] J/cm[.sup]2[/] 
sensitivity with nanosecond exposure, and a dynamic range of 
_D_n = 0.1. With a 50-100Êm thickness of emulsion, 
information 
can be recorded in 5-10 layers. However, the processing of 
materials with this thickness is difficult. Photopolymer is a 
convenient material for immediate reading after recording. The 
significant advantage of the photopolymers is the fact that 
there is no need for a ``wet'' processing, a self fixation with 
recording, and a substantial light amplification. However, 
because the power density in the recording region is much 
greater than the optimal, the sensitivity is decreased with 
recording. The other feature is the dependance of the medium 
absorption coefficient on exposure. Some characteristics of 
several recording media, significant for application with 
multilayer recording devices, are listed in a table. One of 
possible options for reaching a compromise between the layer 
sensitivity and the total number of layers is the application of 
a two-photon absorption. A possible recording diagram of a 
two-photon recording is described. With application of a 
two-photon absorption the fundamental problems of the multi- 
layer recording can be solved. This includes a uniform recording 
in a bulk and a non-destructive reading at the recording 
wavelength. However, the two-photon absorption coefficient for 
most media is small, and becomes significant only with a power 
density of 10[.sup]7[/] - 10[.sup]8[/] W/cm[.sup]2[/].

  [Abstract] Problems of organizing and selecting the 
structure and circuit of elementary cells of a controlled 
transparency of an opto-electronic memory device based on thin 
ferro-electric films are examined. The feasibility and 
advantages are demonstrated of combining the complimentary metal 
oxide semiconductor, silicon on sapphire or silicon on insulated 
substrate with the technology of thin ferroelectric films. A 
structural diagram of a transparency cell with electronic 
recording of information is provided and its functioning is 
discussed. The cell contains an electronic memory element - a 
static flip-flop - and four identical light modulators. Two of 
these modulators are switchable and have a paraphase control. 
Two other, reference modulators, are not switchable and are 
controlled by a dc voltage from an external source. An other 
cell is also described, which contains a differential converter 
with two photo-receivers at the input. For a group parallel 
optical information recording on the transparency, it is best to 
employ in the cell a differential photo-electric converter with 
two photo-detectors at the output operating in the optical 
signal integration mode and a latch flip-flop at the output.

  [Abstract] Geometric aberrations of a lightguide because of 
a nonparallel orientation of its walls have been examined. The 
lightguide consists of a transparent medium bound by two planes. 
The lower plane coincides with the XY plane, the Z axis is 
directed normal to this surface. The upper plane is oriented at 
an angle to the lower, so that it intersects planes ZY and ZX at 
angles _a_ and _g_. The incident light beam lies in a plane 
x=constant, and forms an angle _b_ with the normal to the lower 
plane. If the walls are not parallel, when _a_ and _b_ are 
not 
equal to zero, geometric aberrations are produced, which are 
deviations _D_x[.sup]i[/], _D_y[.sub]i[/] of the 
coordinates of the beam intersection points with the lower plane 
from their value, compared to the ideal case. Computations of 
_D_x, as a function of the number of reflections N for 
different values of parameters _a_ and _g_ were made and the 
results are shown in the graphs. Cases of the light beam 
propagation through a quasi-plane light guide and a case of the 
coordinates deviations _D_x, _D_y from N because of the light 
beam divergence were also examined and the results are provided.

  [Abstract] This article describes an algorithm to calculate 
corrections for sea bottom relief. The main problems to be 
solved in developing this type of algorithm are automating the 
construction of a digital model of the sea bottom, and 
simplifying and speeding up calculations of the effects of 
elementary bodies (approximated by a layer of water). The 
article presents a new approach to solving these problems. 
Points at which the depth of the sea is known are arranged in an 
irregular grid, and depths are calculated in a regular grid 
within that portion of the survey area. Two interpolation 
methods are described. The collection method is described. It is 
used to calculate the gravitational effect of rock beneath the 
sea. The algorithm has been implemented in the software of an 
automated system to process on-board gravimagnetic measurements. 
Product testing is described Results of its use are presented. 
The algorithm is used to study Bouguer anomalies. Figures 2; 
references 6 (Russian).

  [Abstract] An L-410 UVP-E aircraft has been refitted to be 
a flying laboratory for ecological monitoring. This aircraft 
differs from an L-410 in its increased payload capacity, 
increased flight duration, and increased altitude ceiling. 
Five-blade propellers make it more efficient and quieter. It can 
fly at low altitudes (70-300 m) and up to 5000 m at a relatively 
low flight speed (210-350 km/hr). Additional fuel tanks enable 
five hours of flight without refueling. This aircraft costs a 
factor of 4-5 less to operate than an An-30. It is equipped with 
instruments for gamma ray studies (using scintillation 
detectors), thermal sensing, and spectral analysis (to study 
chemical pollution). In-flight processing is possible with the 
use of personal computers. The aircraft has been used to compile 
computer maps of the gamma ray background of a 30 km zone around 
the Chernobyl and Zaporozh atomic energy plants. Thermal 
radiation studies have been done using real-time infrared 
surveying. Figures 2

  [Abstract] Based on expeditions to the Gulf of Taganrog in 
1989 and 1992, the distribution of the most common pollutants in 
this region are analyzed (petroleum products, chlor-, nitro-, 
and alkyl phenols, anionic, cationic, and nonionogenic 
surfactants, sym-triazine pesticides, and heavy metals). Sea 
water, pollutants in suspension, and bottom sediments were 
studied. Phenols, methyl thiotriazines, cadmium, and copper are 
mostly in solution, while nickel, chlortriazine, and cationic 
surfactants are in suspension. Petroleum hydrocarbons, lead, and 
anionic and nonionogenic surfactants are found in the sea in 
these forms in comparable quantities. Estimates are given of 
contamination of bottom sediments with these substances. 
Herbicides are concentrated in the surface layer. Surface layer 
concentrations vary widely. Figures 3; tables 3; references 4: 2

  [Abstract] This is the first of two articles. Mathematical 
modeling with a three-dimensional nonstationary baroclinic model 
with a free surface is used to reproduce the three-dimensional 
structure of the M[.sup]2[/] tidal wave in he barotropic 
Arctic Ocean. The second article describes the results of 
numerical experiments studying the M[.sup]2[/] tidal wave in 
a stratified Arctic Ocean. Here, it is found that the 
oscillations of the level correspond to generally held ideas 
about the tidal wave dynamics of the Arctic Ocean level. The 
main mechanism responsible for the structure of the field of the 
M[.sup]2[/] level in the Arctic Ocean is resonant adjustment 
of level oscillations to morphometric features of the basin. 
Deep ocean is characterized by weak, vertically homogeneous 
currents. Vertical motions in the upper layers of the ocean 
depend on the dynamics of the free surface. As depth increases, 
the bottom relief becomes decisive for the vertical component of 
the tidal wave current. A nonperiodic component is found in the 
barotropic tidal wave current. The effect of the boundary 
between a continental shelf and deep ocean on currents is 
outlined. Figures 7; references 22: 6 Russian, 16 Western.

  [Abstract] Changes over time to the horizontal size of a 
water vapor and hydrochloric acid launch cloud ater the launch 
of a solid fuel rocket are calculated. Its lifetime at the 
surface is calculated for various meteorological conditions. 
Calculations were done for clouds which formed after space 
shuttle launches. The time for the cloud to be destroyed by 
precipitation is estimated. The following assumptions are made: 
the troposphere is not saturated with moisture; there is no 
cloud cover; the temperature and concentration of water vapor 
does not change over the cloud's lifetime; wind speed in 
constant. Cloud altitutde is assumed to be limited by an 
inversion layer. The vertical and horizontal components of 
turbulent diffusion are described. Figure 1; references 10: 4

  [Abstract] The new site-specific endonuclease R 
Bli7361 and methylase M Bli7361 have been 
isolated from Bacillus licheniformis strain 736 by 
blue-agarose, hydroxyapatite-Ultragel, and heparin-Sepharose 
chromatography. The new enzymes were found to be free of 
interfering impurities. The endonuclease R Bli7361 
recognizes the DNA sequence 5'-GGTCTCN1-3'[downward 
arrow-pointing] and 3'-CCAGAG5N-5'[upward-pointing arrow] and 
cleaves it, as indicated by the arrows, at a distance of 1 and 5 
nucleotides from the recognized sequence to form single-strand 
4-nucleotide 5'-protruding termini. This new endonuclease is 
thus an isoschizomer of Eco31I, PpaI, and 
BsaI. The isolation of MBli736I was hailed 
as opening the possibility of studying the nature of the 
methylation of the enzyme site recognized by it. Several 
possible applications of the new enzymes were discussed: (1) 
using R Bli7361 with the DNA of the plasmid pBR322, 
which has only one site for this restrictase that is located in 
the gene of resistance to ampicillin, in order to cleave the 
molecule and thus permit radioactive labeling that would in turn 
facilitate more precise restriction mapping (by Smith and 
Bernstiel's method) of DNA fragments integrated at the 
PstI site; (2) using Bli7361 with the DNA 
of the phage _l_ for selective labeling of terminals by using a 
Klenow fragment as an alternative to using labeled 
oligonucleotides complementary to the natural ``adhesive'' 
terminals of the DNA of the phage _l_ in ``cos''-mapping of 
recombinant phages; (3) using Bli7361 to create 
selective ``holders'' for site-specific mutagenesis or to create 
vectors for directed unilateral shortening of integrated 
fragments and to create ``restoring'' and ``multiplication'' 
vectors. The promise of using the new restrictase to create 
``restoring'' vectors was given special attention. Specifically, 
it was stated that because the phage M13mp18 does not contain 
sites for Bli7361, taking two oppositely directed 
sites for Bli7361 that have a GC-dinucleotide between 
them and introducing them into a polylinker sequence will result 
in the creation of a site for the ``blunt-ended'' restrictase 
NruI, for which there is no site in the vector 
either. This NruI site may then be used to clone 
chemically synthesized oligonucleotides for the purpose of 
subsequently assembling a whole gene in a single ligation 
reaction from oligonucleotides cut from recombinant DNA by using 
Bli7361. Figures 16; references 15: 2 Russian, 13

  [Abstract] The recent development of blood substitutes 
based on fluorocarbons has led to the creation of 
``second-generation'' fluorocarbons that satisfy biomedical 
requirements more adequately. Specifically, an emulsion of 
perfluoroctylbromide [PFOB] emulsion that was initially proposed 
as an x-ray contract medium is now being considered as the basis 
of a promising universal blood substitute. PFOB was incorporated 
as a component in a gas-transport emulsion and injected 
intraperitoneally into female Wistar rats (weighing 180-220 g 
each) in a dose of 10 ml/kg for 3 days. Phenobarbital was 
analogously injected in a dose of 80 mg/kg. The microsomes of 
the murine livers were isolated by differential centrifugation, 
and the content of total cytochrome P-450 in the microsomes was 
measured based on their CO spectra. When the fluorocarbon 
emulsion was added to the microsomal membranes, an 
enzyme-substrate complex, i.e., fully fluorinated organic 
compound-cytochrome P-450, was observed to form. The spectral 
characteristics of the PFOB-cytochrome P-450 complex were 
similar to that of the complex perfluorodecalin-cytochrome 
P-450. Injection of the PFOB emulsion into the rats resulted in 
a 20 percent decrease in the amount of cytochrome P-450 in their 
hepatic microsomes. An analysis of the kinetics of the formation 
of Br[.sup]-[/] when reduced nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide phosphate [NADPH] is added to the murine microsomes 
in the presence of a PFOB emulsion established that the 
concentration of free Br[.sup]-[/] in the study specimens is 
1-2 ÊM higher than in control specimens. These findings were 
taken as unequivocal confirmation of the possibility of 
NADPH-dependent liberation of Br[.sup]-[/] from PFOB in the 
presence of microsomal membranes. The experiments on induction 
of microsomal monoxygenase were interpreted as confirmation of 
the fact that PFOB is a much weaker inducer of the 
``phenobarbital'' isoforms of cytochrome P-450 II 
B[.sup]1[/]/B[.sub]2[/] than the classic fluorocarbon 
inducer of cytochrome P-450 (i.e., perfluorodecalin) is. It was 
hypothesized that the anomalous cytochrome P-450-inducing 
properties of PFOB may be linked to its ability to be 
metabolized by hepatic microsomal monoxygenase. For this reason 
it was concluded that the generally accepted opinion regarding 
the inertness and invariance in the body of organoperfluoro 
compounds containing both heteroatoms (N, O, H, etc.) and double 
bonds needs additional verification. This study was said to be 
the first successful demonstration of the fact that enzyme 
systems of a living organism are capable of causing the 
destruction of fully fluorinated organic compounds. Figures 3, 
tables 2; references 16: 5 Russian, 11 Western.

  [Abstract] A study examined the reaction of 
oligonucleotides and their reactive derivatives carrying the 
fragment 4'[N-2-chloroethyl-N-methyl)amino]benzylamine in their 
5'-terminal phosphate group with the proteins of blood serum. 
The desoxyribonucleotides p(T)[.sup]16[/] and 
(pTGACCCTCTTCCCATT) used in the studies were synthesized by the 
phosphotriester method in a solution. A [.sup]32[/]P 
radioactive label was introduced into the oligonucleotides by 
exchange of the 5'-terminal phosphate. Double-stranded DNA of 
the plasmid pTZ18R and heparin were used as competitors to 
determine the specificity of the reaction of the oligonucleotide 
derivatives with the proteins. Murine monoclonal antibodies 
specific for human myoglobin were used to study the interaction 
of the oligonucleotides with the immunoglobins IgG and IgM. 
During the experiments, whole human blood serum was incubated 
with different concentrations of alkylating oligonucleotide 
derivatives at 37Î for 10 or 40 minutes. The modified 
proteins were analyzed by DS-Na-electrophoresis in gradient 
polyacrylamide gel in a Laemmli system. The experiments 
demonstrated that incubation of whole human blood serum with 
different concentrations of the alkylating derivative 
p(T)[.sup]16[/] results in affine modification of several 
proteins, including albumin and the immunoglobins M and G. The 
dependence of the degree of modification of these three proteins 
on oligonucleotide concentration was taken as evidence that the 
oligonucleotides have a higher affinity to IgM than to IgG and 
albumin. Binding of the reactive oligomer derivatives with the 
proteins was inhibited in the presence of various polyanions, 
i.e., oligomers of another composition, double-strand DNA, and 
heparin. The fact that heparin had the greatest inhibiting 
effect for the immunoglobins led to speculation regarding 
relatively nonspecific ionic interaction in the formation of the 
complex IgG-oligonucleotide. Reaction of the oligonucleotide 
with monoclonal antibodies of the subclass G1 was inhibited in 
the presence of a specific antigen. This finding was taken as an 
indication that the oligonucleotides may react with the 
immunoglobins either at or near the site where the antigen is 
recognized by the antibody. The experiments performed thus 
established that oligonucleotides bind with basic blood proteins 
with a rather high affinity and revealed interacting features of 
the reaction of immunoglobins with oligonucleotides that may be 
used to study the effector functions of these molecules. Figures 
4; references 9: 3 Russian, 6 Western.

  [Abstract] The method of affine chromatography on agarose 
with the immobilized dye blue cybacron F3GA (Blue-Sepharose 6B 
CL) was used to isolate two thrombin-like enzymes from the venom 
of common and eastern pit vipers (Agistrodon halys 
halys) and Agkistrodon halys Blomhoffii). The 
new enzymes, which were given the respective names Ancistron-H 
and Ancistron-B were isolated in homogeneous form. The new 
thrombim-like enzymes are serine proteases with respective 
molecular masses of 34 and 29 kDa, respective isoelectric points 
of 6.6 and 6.3, and respective specific coagulation activities 
of 410 and 110 NIH units/mg of protein. Upon incubation with 
fibrinogen, they only cleave fibrinopeptide A from the 
A_a_-chain, leaving the B_b_- and _g_-chains intact. Both 
enzymes were demonstrated to hydrolyze arginine esters and 
thrombin-specific chromogenic peptide substrates and to manifest 
weak caseinolytic activity and no fibrinolytic activity. The 
newly isolated enzymes were used to develop simple 
coagulation-based diagnostic indicators to determine the 
fibrinogen level in blood plasma during heparin therapy without 
the need for any special equipment. Ancistron-H may also be used 
for clinical purposes. Tests conducted on rabbits confirmed the 
possibility of using it in vivo as a defibrination agent. 
Specifically, intravenous [IV] injection of Ancistron-H in a 
dose of 300 NIH units per kilogram of body weight resulted in 
the death of all of the test animals within 2-5 minutes as a 
result of the development of acute thrombosis of the truncal 
vessels and in the vicinity of the right ventricle. After IV 
injection of Ancistron-H in a dose of 100 NIH units per kilogram 
of body weight, all the test animals remained alive; however, 
blood taken from them 30 minutes later showed advanced 
hypercoagulation. Blood samples taken 120 minutes after the 
animals were given IV injections of Ancistron-H in a dose of 25 
NIH units per kilogram of body weight, on the other hand, 
confirmed the development of deep hypofibrinogenemia. The 
possibility of using Ancistron-H for analogous purposes was also 
confirmed in experiments studying the effect of a decrease in 
fibrinogen level on metastasized L carcinoma in mice. IV 
injection of Ancistron-H into the mice's venous sinus in a dose 
of 2.5 NIH units per kilogram of body weight induced a decrease 
in fibrinogen level to 30 percent of the norm, which in turn 
reduced metastasis by a factor of 2.7-3. Experiments on mice 
also confirmed the possibility of using Ancistron-H to prolong 
the effect of liposomal drugs during correction of the process 
of intravascular blood coagulation. Figures 3, tables 3; 
references 42: 12 Russian, 30 Western.

of Railroad Transport Engineers] 
  [Abstract] For a long time, the only equipment designed in 
Russia to scrub gases released into the atmosphere by industrial 
and power generation facilities was ash- and dust-trapping 
equipment. Most of the pieces of gas- and dust-trapping 
equipment that were designed had comparatively low trapping 
coefficients. It has been estimated that hundreds of billions of 
rubles in ``emergency capital expenditures'' are needed to 
achieve current maximum permissible one-time concentrations of 
various toxic substances (including sulfurous anhydride and 
nitrogen dioxide) in cities throughout Russia. Two indicators of 
maximum permissible concentration of toxic substances are 
currently in use. The maximum permissible one-time concentration 
is determined by air sampled over a 20-minute period at the 
level of the respiratory organs, and it refers to effects on the 
threshold of reflex activity (sense of smell, light-headedness, 
bioelectric activity of the cerebral cortex). The maximum 
permissible average daily concentration, on the other hand, 
refers to a 24-hour sampling at the same level in a given area 
in which an animal could go 3 or 4 months without experiencing 
any observable toxic or other related effects on its body. The 
maximum permissible one-time concentration is thus an indicator 
of human comfort, whereas the maximum permissible average daily 
concentration is a criterion of the nontoxicity of a given 
concentration of pollutant for humans. In the case of sulfurous 
anhydride, the current maximum permissible one-time 
concentration is 10 times higher than the maximum permissible 
average daily concentration, and in the case of ash and dust, 
the current maximum permissible one-time concentration is 3.33 
times higher than the maximum permissible average daily 
concentration. These standards, while possibly economically 
justified in the case of existing gas-scrubbing equipment and 
facilities, will only result in the need for new ``emergency 
capital expenditures'' in the future if they are applied to 
equipment and facilities now being designed and constructed. The 
need to revise current maximum permissible concentrations used 
in design standards is evident from calculations performed for 
actual thermal electric power plants. The pollution levels 
permitted by current maximum permissible one-time concentrations 
are unsafe and have been calculated without consideration for 
various exacerbating meteorological factors such as high air 
temperature and extended periods of calm or very low winds. It 
must also be remembered that some Russian population centers 
experience these meteorological conditions 3 or 4 months each 
year. If future waves of ``emergency capital expenditures'' are 
to be avoided, existing standards governing the technological 
design of thermal electric power plants, the Construction 
Standards and Rules [SNiP] governing boiler units and thermal 
electric power plants, and the respective standards governing 
other sectors must be revised. Specifically, these documents 
must begin using the maximum permissible average daily 
concentration in specifying standards for gas-scrubbing 
facilities and equipment. The additional up-front costs will 
more than be made up for in the long run. Figures 3; references 
6 (Russian).

  [Abstract] Russian public health clinics are not equipped 
with domestic kits for determining thyrotropin (TT) even though 
there is a critical need for them in the diagnosis and treatment 
of thyroid gland diseases. The goal of this research was to 
develop a sensitive immunoenzyme test system, based on 
high-affinity monoclonal antibodies (monoAB), for quantitative 
determination of human thyrotropin. One monoAB was immobilized 
on polystyrene microtitration plates; another was conjugated 
with horse radish peroxidase (HRP). The analysis was 
technologically effective, it was conducted in one step, and it 
took 2.5 hours to complete. The detection limit of TT was 0.1 
ÊIU/ml. A highly sensitive three-step test system, utilizing 
a 
streptavidin-biotin complex, was proposed that made it possible 
to detect 0.01 ÊIU/ml TT. Figures 4; references 14: 2

  [Abstract] The recent discovery of two new neurospecific 
proteins (NSP) -- _a_-1 BG and _a_-2 BG -- in human brain 
extract has opened new horizons in the search for these proteins 
and antibodies against them in the biological fluids of patients 
with various neuro-psychiatric diseases. In this work, a highly 
sensitive variant of immunoenzyme analysis based on column 
immunoadsorption chromatography (TIEAIC -- two-site immunoenzyme 
analysis by immunoadsorption chromatography) was developed for 
quantitative determination of antibodies against _a_-1 BG and 
_a_-2 BG (detection limit -- 0.35 ng/ml). The phenomenon of the 
presence of antibodies against the above-listed proteins was 
identified in extreme conditions caused by psychiatric diseases 
(36-42%), multiple sclerosis in the active phase 
(16-29%), 
injuries (14-43%), astrocytomal (14-33%) and 
oligodendrogliomal (18-40%) brain tumors, as well as 
influenza 
(13%), intestinal infections (6-9%), pneumonia 
(28%), and 
peritonitis and pancreatitis (25-33%). The authors 
proposed 
that TIEAIC analysis of antibodies against _a_-1 BG and 
_a_-2 BG 
may be used as an auxiliary test for diagnostics and monitoring 
during the treatment of several diseases whose pathogeneses 
involve a breach in the blood-brain barrier. Figures 2;

  [Abstract] Synthetic oligoribonucleotides with a 
predetermined heterocyclic base sequence are widely used as 
research tools for solving a number of problems in bioorganic 
chemistry and molecular biology. In particular, 
oligoribonucleotides containing the ApUpG initiation codon on 
the 5'-terminal of the molecule have found application as mRNA 
models in studies of ribosome functional processes. The most 
promising and universal method for preparative synthesis of 
short oligoribonucleotides is based on using immobilized T4 
bacteriophage RNA-ligase for joining chemically synthesized 
triplets. In this work, the oligoribonucleotides 
ApUpG(pU)[.sup]n[/] and ApUpG(pU)[.sub]n[/]pUp were 
synthesized from oligoribouridilates via catalysis with 
immobilized RNA-ligase. The oligoribouridilates were obtained 
from hydrolysis of poly(U) endonuclease from cobra venom and 
from ApUpG trinucleoside diphosphate that had been chemically 
synthesized by the phosphotriester method. Seven reaction cycles 
were carried out on one column with the immobilized enzyme. The 
end product yield varied from 4.9 to 18.0% after 
chromatographic purification. The structure of the obtained 
compounds was verified by chromatography with labels and enzyme 
hydrolysis down to the nucleosides. References 15: 12 Russian, 3

  [Abstract] In order to improve solid phase enzymatic 
synthesis of extended oligoribonucleotides, the authors used 
biogel P-300, sepharose 4B, and cellulose hydrazides as 
substrates to immobilize tetraribonucleotides that had been 
oxidized with sodium periodate. The reactivity of 
(pU)[.sup]3[/]pU[.sub]ox[/] and 
(Ap)[.sup]3[/]A[.sub]ox[/] tetraribonucleotides 
immobilized on the above substrates was studied in solid phase 
ligation and phosphorylation reactions. The subscript ``ox'' 
indicates a sodium periodate-oxidized nucleoside residue with 
cleavage of the 2'-3'-C-C-bond. In this case, it was discovered 
that the greatest yield in both reactions was achieved with the 
use of biogel P-300 and sepharose 4B. An advantage of sepharose 
4B over biogel P-300 was that it had superior hydrodynamic 
qualities. References 7: 6 Russian, 1 Western.

  [Abstract] In a group of industrial Lactococcus 
lactis, subspecies lactis and 
cremoris strains, mutants were produced that were 
deficient in lactose, sucrose, and fructose utilization. 
Analysis of the plasmid profiles indicated an absence of 
plasmids 45-54 TPN in size in several mutants. From studying 
these mutants, the authors were able to identify the plasmids 
containing the genes for lactose, sucrose, and fructose 
fermentation in these microorganisms. Two strains, L. 
lactis lactis 90 and L. lactis cremoris ROM, 
were identified in which the mutants, deficient in lactose 
utilization, experienced phage resistance spectrum changes; in 
both cases, the changes consisted of the appearance of phage 
sensitivity with respect to various phages. In L. lactis 
lactis 90, the genes corresponding to lactose utilization 
and the genes participating in phage resistance control were 
apparently located on the 53.7 TPN plasmid. This work was 
completed, in part, with resources supplied by the Russian State 
Scientific and Technical Program ``Priority Directions in 
Genetics.'' Figures 1; references 10: 4 Russian, 6 Western.

  [Abstract] Electron transmission microscopy was used to 
study the ultramicroscopic structure of macrophages involved in 
the reparative regeneration of Wistar rat skeletal muscles after 
a mechanical injury. Two morpho-functional types were 
established, based on the ultramicroscopic features of the 
macrophages and morphometric characteristics of these cells' 
organelles. The first type included macrophages with a 
pronounced lysosomal apparatus and a large number of phagosomes 
that contained a muscular dendrite. They were responsible for 
phagocytic functions and facilitated debridement of tissue 
disintegration products from the wound. The second (secretory) 
type included cells with a developed granular endoplasmic 
reticulum that could exert a regulatory influence on skeletal 
muscle reparative regeneration processes. Immunomodulators 
influenced the level of organelle development in both types of 
macrophages, which facilitated earlier initiation of 
regeneration processes and wound healing. Figures 3; references

  [Abstract] The distribution and quantity of the main 
cytoskeleton proteins (actin, tubulin, neurofilamentous protein 
of molecular weight 160 kDa, and glial fibrillar acid protein) 
were studied by means of monoclonal antibodies (fluorescein 
isothiocyanate- and rhodamine-labelled) in various types of 
mouse embryo spinal cord cells cultured in monolayers. During 
the process of neuron development, tubulin moved from the 
neuronal soma into its processes. Tubulin's concentration varied 
among the processes. The authors hypothesized that the processes 
with higher tubulin concentration were more functionally active 
at those particular stages of differentiation. The total amount 
of tubulin should remain constant during a neuron's lifetime, 
however. The quantity and distribution of actin filaments in 
different types of cells varied. The actin content in neurons 
was lower than in glial cells and fibroblasts. Most of the 
protein (neurofilamentous, glial fibrillar acid protein) was 
concentrated in cell bodies and in proximal parts of the 
processes. The cytoskeleton protein distribution pattern in 
spinal cord cells was identified. Figures 4; references 17: 5

  [Text]HIV, the etiological cause of AIDS, is characterized 
by a high degree of variability. The variability of HIV genes, 
combined with the latency phenomenon that is inherent in 
lentiviruses, enables the virus to elude the defense systems of 
the human body rather successfully 4, 6]. 
  In western countries with the largest number of HIV-positive 
individuals and AIDS victims (USA, France, England, Germany), 
numerous HIV isolates were obtained differing in antigenic and 
molecular-biological properties [1, 3, 5]. The existence of two 
HIV serotypes was established: HIV-1 and HIV-2 [4, 6]. 
Immunodeficiency viruses were isolated from primates and cats 
that were very similar to HIV. With the appearance of 
HIV-positive individuals and AIDS cases in the former USSR, it 
became necessary to isolate and study the HIV strains 
circulating in this territory. For this reason, our objective 
here was to isolate and analyze the features of domestic HIV 
strains. 
<H5>  Material and Methods </H5>
  Isolation of viruses. We obtained HIV isolates 
from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) using a modification of 
the method in [1]. After PBL isolation with use of a 
ficoll-isopaque (Sweden) gradient, they were stimulated by 
phytohemagglutinin in a concentration of 5 Êg/ml (Sigma, USA) 
for 48 h, eluted and cultivated in the presence of human 
interleukin-2 for 4-6 weeks or up to the time of cocultivation 
with lymphocytic and monocytic cell lines, as well as with PBL 
from healthy donors stimulated as described above. 
  Viruses. In addition to our isolates, we used HIV 
strains kindly furnished by Professor L. Montagnier: HIV-1/BRU, 
Professor Gallo: HIV-1/IIIB, and Professor J. Levy: HIV-1/SF4. 
  Cells. We used transferable human cell lines H9, 
Hut-78, CEM, MT-4, MOLT-4, CEM-SS, U-937, Jurkat tat and others, 
obtained from the collection of the Institute of Virology imeni 
D. I. Ivanovskiy, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences. The cells 
were cultivated in a concentration of 0.3-0.5 million per 
milliliter medium RPMI-1640 with 10 percent fetal calf serum, 
300 Êg/ml L-glutamine, and 100 Êg/ml gentamycin, and 
incubated in suspension form. Viability of cells was determined 
by staining with 0.4 percent trypan blue. 
  Immunofluorescence. Cells that expressed HIV 
antigen on the surface were counted by the standard method using 
serum containing antibodies to HIV-1 from an AIDS patient. 
  Electron microscopy. After centrifuging at 2000 
rpm for 5 min, cell sediments were collected and fixed 
successively in 2.5 percent glutaraldehyde solution and 1 
percent OsO[.sup]4[/] in phosphate buffer, dehydrated and 
embedded in araldite. Sections were contrasted with uranyl 
acetate and silver nitrate using conventional techniques, then 
examined under an SEM-100B microscope. 
  Enzyme immunoassay. For direct enzyme 
immunoassay (EIA), we used a test system that we prepared for 
demonstration of HIV-1 antigens in culture fluid of cells 
infected with HIV-1 where antibodies to HIV-1 obtained from 
blood serum of AIDS patients were adsorbed in the solid phase. 
Peroxidase-tagged antibodies were obtained by binding 
immunoglobulins from the serum of HIV positive individuals 
(titer greater than 1:40,000 in the Organon test system) with 
armoracia peroxidase using the periodate method. EIA sensitivity 
constituted more than 2 ng/ml viral antigen. We added up to 0.1 
percent tween-20 to the specimens of material and applied them 
to wells in a tray. They were incubated for 18 h at 4ÎC, 
washed, conjugate in a 1:1000 dilution was added, then they were 
incubated for 1 h at 37ÎC. We eluted them, added substrate 
and measured absorption. 
  Reverse transcriptase reaction. The reaction was 
run in a lysate of precipitated virus (25,000 rpm, 1.5 h, lysis 
in buffer of: 50 percent glycerin, 7.5 mM HCl pH 7.5, 75 mM KCl, 
1 mM DTT [dithiothreitol], 0.2 percent triton X-100). The 
reaction was carried out in a buffer of: 10 mM HCl (pH 7.5), 20 
mM KCl, 2 mM magnesium chloride solution, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.02 
percent triton X-100, 0.2 mg/ml poly(rA)-digo(dT)[.sup]10[/] 
and [.sup]3[/]H TTP, 2 ÊCi per specimen. Incubation for 1 h 
at 37ÎC [1]. 
  Polymerase chain reaction., isolation of DNA from 
cells. 1.5 ml cell suspension was precipitated, the sediment 
eluted 3 times in buffer at 4000 rpm for 30 min. We added 100 
Êl phosphate solution and saline buffer (pH 7.2) containing 
proteinase K in a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Incubation was 
carried out for 1 h at 55ÎC, for 16 h at 37ÎC, then 
heated for 2 min at 94ÎC. 
  The reaction was run using the following concentrations of 
reagents: dNTP mixture -- 200 ÊM each; primers -- 1 ÊM 
each; 
template -- 50 pg per sample; Tag enzyme - polymerase -- 4 U per 
sample, tris-HCl pH 9.3 -- 10 mM; KCl -- 50 mM; magnesium 
chloride -- 2 mM; gelatin -- 0.1 mg/ml. 
  We used 25 cycles at the following temperatures: 2 min at 
37ÎC -- fusion, 5 min at 72ÎC -- elongation, and 2 min 
at 94ÎC -- denaturation. 
<H5>  4. Results and Discussion </H5>
  Experiments for isolation of HIV isolates from material 
taken 
from HIV positive subjects and AIDS patients in 22 cities of the 
former USSR: Moscow, Elista, Leningrad, Rostov, Stavropol, 
Penza, Volgograd, Smolensk, Riga, Armavir, Donetsk and others. 
We obtained a total of 81 HIV isolates. 
  Effectiveness of HIV isolation constituted 29.1 percent in 
the case of asymptomatic carriers, 71.4 percent in HIV positive 
cases with generalized lymphadenopathy, and 90.5 percent in AIDS 
patients with severe manifestations of the disease. 
  Immunological analysis of the HIV isolates enabled us to 
determine that 79 out of the 81 HIV isolates are type I, 2 are 
type II and are HIV-2 strains. 
  We identified HIV isolates using several independent 
methods. 
At the early stages after HIV isolation, the virus was tested 
using enzyme immunoassay and immunofluorescence analysis, and we 
also measured reverse transcriptase activity in the culture 
medium. 
  Then we studied the HIV isolates using electron microscopy, 
the immune blot method and polymerase chain reaction. The test 
results are listed in the table.

  The data indicate that the first signs of HIV are 
demonstrable on the 7th-10th day of observation by determination 
of reverse transcriptase activity. Peak RT occurred on the 
16th-19th day for many strains. The level of reverse 
transcriptase activity differed appreciably, depending on the 
isolated strain. It was possible to distinguish a second group 
of strains which demonstrated an RT peak on the 30th-35th day. 
The patterns of rise and decline in RT activity in peripheral 
blood lymphocytes coincided on the whole with detection of HIV 
antigen by EIA. After infecting transferable lymphoblastoid cell 
lines with HIV strains, maximum production of HIV antigen in 
culture fluid occurred on the 3d-5th to 12th-15th day, depending 
on the type of cell culture and HIV strain. Reproduction of 
isolates in sensitive cell lines was accompanied by a typical 
cytopathic effect. Most frequently, infected cells showed 
virus-induced fusions of cell membranes of giant ``balloons'' 
and syncytia. In other instances, there were no such structures; 
however, a strong cytodestructive effect was noted. The time of 
syncytia formation in infected cells depended on infectivity of 
the strains, and with highly infective strains they appeared on 
the 4th-5th day. 
  The cytopathic effect of viruses was demonstrable in the 
2d-3d week after infecting the cell cultures in the case of 3 
strains differing in infective activity. Formation of syncytia 
was correlated with expression of HIV antigens on the surface of 
infected cells, as demonstrable by indirect immunofluorescence. 
The number of cells with HIV antigens in the cell population 
ranged from 2-7 to 24-53 percent for HIV-1/IV3, HIV-1/IV17, 
HIV-1/IV21, HIV-1/IV39, and HIV-1/IV54. 
  Electron microscopy most often revealed HIV virions near the 
cell membrane or showed budding on it. Mature virions consisted 
of spherical particles 100-120 nm in size, with a pear-shaped, 
acentric core. Virions of a new HIV generation were demonstrable 
on the 3d day after infecting cells, while the maximum number of 
extracellular and budding viral particles was found on the 5th 
postinfection day. The spectrum of isolated HIV differed from 
that of cell cultures. A large group of strains was capable of 
reproduction only in a limited number of cell lines. 
  In some cases, HIV-1/IV5, HIV-1/IV7, HIV-1/IV11 and others 
were isolated from asymptomatic HIV carriers. 
  However, this pattern was not always observed and, in the 
case of HIV-1/IV13, HIV-1/IV24 and others from asymptomatic 
carriers, strains were obtained for which there was a wide 
spectrum of sensitive cell lines. 
  Some of the HIV strains had the capacity to grow on both 
lymphocytic and monocytic cell lines. In many cases, these were 
strains isolated from patients at the 3d-4th stage of disease, 
with marked symptoms. 
  It must be noted that, in addition to the capacity to 
multiply in different types of cells, the HIV strains 
demonstrated differing kinetics of viral production in cells of 
the same type. 
  Thus, the obtained HIV-1 isolates can be divided into two 
groups, having low and high productivity. The former group has a 
limited replicative capacity, low or negative RT and EIA. The 
second group is characterized by high infectivity (4.5-6.0 
TCID[.sup]50[/]), high RT, EIA, and capacity to multiply in 
various transferable cell lines. 
  Separation of strains into those with low and high 
infectivity is also typical of HIV isolated in Europe and the 
United States, which is indicative of the similarity of 
biological properties of our HIV strains and foreign ones [2, 5]. 
  Comparison of characteristics and level of viral antigen 
production by cells infected with Russian, highly infective 
strains to reference strains HIV-1/IIIB, HIV-1/BRU, and 
HIV-1/SF4 revealed that they have the necessary properties to 
recover HIV antigen for diagnostic purposes. 
  Using a set of primers complementary to the sites of the gag 
and pol genes and the polymerase chain reaction, we obtained 
viral DNA fragments 2438 base pairs in size. The fragment was 
then spliced into the Blue script SK+ plasmid, TG1 cells were 
transfected, and clones were isolated with this fragment of the 
HIV genome. As a result of sequencing the DNA of HIV-1/IV54, it 
became possible to compare amino acid sequences of the gag 
protein fragment of this virus to the prototype foreign HIV-1 
specimens [7]. 
  The findings indicate that the homology of strain HIV-1/IV54 
with HIV-1/MAL, which is typical for the African content, 
constitutes 65 percent. Similarity to the North American strain 
HIV-1/MN constitutes 81 percent, which is indicative of somewhat 
greater resemblance of HIV-1/IV54 to the American HIV-1 subtype. 
  Studies of HIV strains isolated from HIV positive 
individuals 
from different regions of our country revealed that the HIV 
isolates were heterogenous. 
  Mainly the type 1 virus, HIV-1, is circulating among the 
population of Russia (98.1 percent); however, in the last 2 
years HIV-2 infection has been noted among our citizens. 
  Thus, it can be noted that there is circulation in our 
country of HIV-1 and HIV-2, which differ in molecular-biological 
properties, but are similar in the main parameters to the 
prototype HIV-1 strains that are widespread in America, Africa 
and Europe.

  [Abstract] A common approach to safety 
in the handling of pathogenic microorganisms in microbiological 
laboratories is based on the probability of biological effects 
resulting from exposure to a microorganism or its metabolites. 
This approach also entails definition of socially acceptable 
risk vis-a-vis a defined endpoint, e.g., death. The suggestion 
is made that safety be calculated in terms of probability that 
protective barriers might be overcome by the pathogen per hour 
of work and be released into the working area. For microbiology 
laboratories concerned with pathogens the recommendation is made 
that the acceptable probability for such an event be set at 
10[.sup]-8[/] h[.sup]-1[/]. Figures 3; references 22: 10

  [Abstract] Studying the processes of compound heat transfer 
and biochemical transformations in the coagulated area are of 
fundamental importance in providing a scientific framework for 
surgery, predicting its outcome, optimizing its conditions, and 
reducing post-operative complications. This paper discusses a 
mathematical model of thermokeratocoagulation in terms of 
thermochemistry and shows how operating conditions may affect 
the size of the tissue damage zone. The authors developed the 
TERMO-K program system for the IBM PC AT to run their model. The 
user inputs data about the operating conditions and the design 
features of the needle, and the model predicts the size and 
character of the resultant tissue damage zone by simulating the 
thermal coagulator operation. From the model, the authors found 
linear relationships between increases in the initial needle 
temperature and the exposure time and tissue damage. They also 
found a positive correlation between the radial size of 
coagulation and its volume. In a comparison of modeled results 
with experimental studies, the authors found qualitative 
agreement in the effects of initial needle temperature on the 
radial size of coagulation. The thermochemical model and the 
TERMO-K system can be used to refine the 
thermokeratocolagulation procedure and may be adapted for 
analysis of intrastromal keratocoagulation, laser coagulation, 
keratoconus therapy, and other surgical techniques involving 
thermal effects on the cornea. Figures 6; references 17: 10

  [Abstract] In the course of conducting theoretical and 
experimental studies of the histopathological effects of 
thermokeratocoagulation on rabbit corneas, the authors found a 
similar American study (Feldman, et al.) to be erroneous in its 
conclusion that thermokeratocoagulation is inadequate in terms 
of safety and efficacy. In this work, the authors found that 
thermokeratocoagulation is relatively safe and that severe 
tissue damage is primarily caused by improper insertion of the 
needle into the cornea. The authors also found that the use of 
thermal effects in ophthalmic surgery calls for a very precise 
application of data obtained from animals to humans, i.e., 
thermocoagulation conditions designed for humans cannot be 
automatically applied to rabbits, which was the mistake made by 
the Americans. They also concluded that using mathematical 
simulation in ophthalmosurgery will substantially facilitate the 
analysis of specific surgical processes, greatly reduce costly 
and time-consuming medical and biological studies, and provide 
for more accurate predictions of the outcome of operations, 
including the transition from animal to human experiments. The 
computerized TERMO-K modeling program (IBM PC AT) developed by 
the authors successfully predicted the American 
ophthalmologists' results, which was additional proof of the 
program's scientific and educational applicability. Figures 9;

<F P=106> [Unattributed article under the ``Hope'' rubric: ``Children </F>
Will Hear!''] 
  [Text] In Russia a brand new unique method for treating 
acute deafness in children has been developed. Staff members at 
Russia State Medical University have had success with the method 
in 67 percent of cases. Throughout the world, the results of 
treating this pathology are virtually nil. 
  Staff members in the Hyperbaric Oxygenation Laboratory (that 
is, treatment in baric chambers under elevated or reduced oxygen 
pressure) working under the direction of Professor Sergey Baydin 
developed their own original method to solve the problem. 
  In a conversation with an ITAR-TASS correspondent, Sergey 
Baydin emphasized that only acute deafness is cured. In other 
words, the treatment is effective only during the first 3 weeks 
after the onset of decrease or loss of hearing. To date, in 
other cases it has only been possible to halt the process' 
development. ``There are many reasons for the development of 
deafness in children,'' said Sergey Baydin. ``Included among 
them are catarrhal illnesses, nervous stresses after family 
rows, and overdoses of drugs (especially antibiotics).'' 
  The treatment is conducted in domestic baric chambers. In 
addition to using their new method to treat deafness, the 
physicians have learned to use it to manage critical diseases in 
neonates. Special chambers have been designed and constructed 
for this. In adults, hyperbaric oxygenation has proven effective 
against cardiovascular diseases, conditions following myocardial 
infarction, stomach and duodenal ulcers, and purulent tissue 
lesions. In many cases, treatment in baric chambers makes it 
possible to avoid using drugs or keep their use to a minimum.

Sorokina: ``Conflict That Could Not Be: ``For the Sake of 
Order'' Officials Transformed Unique Treatment Into Regular 
Polyclinic Only To Again Make It a Center''] 
  [Text] And the story began as follows. At the end of last 
year, the Main Medical Administration in Moscow decided to bring 
order to the capital's medical institutions. Those institutions 
that had previously had the status of all-union institutions 
became the stumbling block. The Russian Ministry of Health 
sheltered some of them. It was proposed that the others become 
Moscow polyclinics. 
  The unique Center for the Rehabilitation of Invalids and 
Patients With Spinal Trauma, which is headed by living legend 
Valentin Dikul and which is the only one of its kind not only in 
Russia but in the entire former USSR as well, fell among these 
``others.'' The ``Retsept'' wrote about it in detail in the past 
once. I will therefore recall just one fact: For its well-known 
services, Dikul's center was listed in the World Register of 
Medical Institutions. 
  Moscow's central medical board dealt with this unique 
institution as follows: It decided to reshape it into an 
ordinary Moscow polyclinic with its associates given a rank 5 
salary. 
  What did this mean? First, specialists who knew a rare 
method 
incurred a big salary loss. Second, the polyclinic had to accept 
primarily Moscow residents and had to refuse to help patients 
from other regions. And third, the center's director V. Dikul 
found himself thrown overboard: The polyclinic's staff roster 
did not contain the post of director, and a medical education 
was required for the chief physician (Dikul never finished his). 
  The stand-off between the center and Moscow's medical board 
continued for more than half a year. The public sided with Dikul 
and his associates. Such prestigious individuals as Yu. Nikulin, 
M. Zakharov, Y. Yevtushenko, and many others wrote to Moscow's 
mayoralty and the federal government. The stand-off could not 
but affect the rehabilitation center's activity: It had to cut 
back the number of Russian patients accepted to only the most 
critical, and even those Moscow patients who did not fit the 
center's profile -- those with radiculitis, osteochondrosis, 
etc., had to be accepted. 
  The public was not pressured, and the mayoralty to whom it 
appealed and medical officials made concessions. They proposed 
that Dikul write a letter in which he would ask to be under the 
``wing'' of the central medical board but as the Moscow 
rehabilitation center. In other words, the version that 
Dikulev's supporters proposed half a year ago was revived. 
  Who needed all this idle fuss? I cannot document it, but 
perhaps something will clarify this curious information. 
``Buyers'' who are not hiding their intentions came to the 
rehabilitation center. While examining the ``goods'' (the 
building), they said that they find it entirely suitable as a 
commercial health improvement center: Luckily, there is a pool 
and rooms for training equipment, and a magnificent park with an 
athletic field in the neighborhood. To the question of their 
``aims,'' the ``buyers'' answered significantly: The land, they 
say, is full of rumors... 
  This time the public, with the help of the capital's 
mayoralty, uncovered the source of the rumors. This time. But 
there is no guarantee that a similar situation will not be 
repeated with other commercial-type medical institutions. To 
sell is not to build.

<F P=106> [Article by ITAR-TASS: ``Mother and Child Care--93''] </F>
  [Text]The birth and upbringing of a child are the most 
important problems in the area of motherhood and childhood. The 
international exhibit on ``Mother and Child Care--93,'' which 
opened in Moscow, proposes to solve them by means of the latest 
medical technologies. 
  In his remarks at the opening of this exhibit, Eduard 
Nechayev, Russian Federation health minister, stated that the 
problem of mother and child care in Russia is presently one of 
the top priorities. For expressly this reason he considers this 
exhibit to be very important. The minister expressed his hope 
that this will be instrumental in development of a system of 
mother and child care in our country. 
  The indicators characterizing obstetric care in Russia are 
lower than those of a number of foreign countries: mother and 
infant mortality rates, as well as morbidity rates for children 
and pregnant women, are high. The incidence of abortions also 
remains high. In the opinion of Nikolay Vaganov, Russian 
Federation deputy health minister, all this is attributable, to 
a considerable extent, to the flaws in obstetric technologies, 
intensive care and resuscitation of neonates, as well as 
shortage of drugs. The deputy minister mentioned that one of the 
ways to solve this problem is for Russia to set up joint 
production of equipment and drugs with western firms. 
  The ``Mother and Child'' exhibit offers modern equipment, 
instruments and drugs used in gynecology, obstetrics and 
pediatrics.

<F P=106> [Interview with Doctor L. F. Berezhkov: ``A Doctor's </F>
Heartache -- Every Other Child in the Russian Federation Has a 
Chronic Illness''; first paragraph is PRAVDA introduction] 
  [Excerpts]Leonid Fedorovich Berezhkov, doctor of medical 
sciences and professor, heads the Department for the Study of 
dynamics of Schoolchild Health Dynamics, Scientific Research 
Institute of Hygiene and Prevention of Diseases of Children, 
Adolescents and Young People, of the RF Goskomsanepidnadzor 
[State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Oversight]. 
Our correspondent asked him to answer a few questions. 
  [Question]How do you generally assess the physical 
condition of the youngest Russian citizens? 
  [Answer]Unfortunately, there is little reason for 
optimism. More than half of all schoolchildren suffer from 
chronic diseases. In essence this refers to pathology of the 
nasopharynx, digestive organs, nervous system, anemia and 
allergies. 
  [Question]What do the scientists predict for the 
next few years? 
  [Answer]Frankly speaking, nothing good. In view of 
deterioration of ecological conditions, we should expect a rise 
in both acute and chronic diseases, particularly allergies, 
bronchial asthma, and dermatitis. Worsening of nutrition will 
lead to being underweight, retarded growth, sexual development, 
anemia, and diminished constitutional resistance. The more 
stress situations there are, the more often we will encounter 
mental diseases, poorer immunity, physical development, 
pathology of digestive and hemopoietic organs. 
  [Question]You mentioned the impact of ecological 
conditions on child health. In what regions are there more sick 
kids? 
  [Answer]There are the fewest healthy children in 
the Central-Chernozem region (33 percent), Volga region (39 
percent), the Far East (41 percent), while the best regions are: 
North Caucusus (55 percent), North-West (54 percent), and 
Kaliningrad (51 percent). The largest number of children with 
chronic disease are in Moscow and St. Petersburg. The children 
of the Urals and West Siberia do not enjoy good health.

  [Text]Lyubov Kazina, head of the Moscow Department of 
Education, states that ``48 percent of the children in Moscow 
cannot be called essentially healthy. A total of 260,000 
children suffer from serious chronic pathology, which means that 
about every sixth child is affected. Statistics show that the 
physical condition of children worsens in school. Thus, less 
than 1 percent of the children have postural disturbances in 
nursery schools, and by the time they are in second grade, the 
figure rises to 4 percent. In the lowest grades, visual 
impairment is observed in almost 6 percent of the 
schoolchildren, and by the eighth grade, this applies to 21 
percent.''

<F P=106> [Article by Aman Duysekeyev: Infancy Is a Happy [preceding </F>
word crossed out] Dangerous Age''; first paragraph is AZIYA 
introduction] 
  [Text]As already written in the AZIYA newspaper, an 
international seminar was held recently in Alma-Ata which 
discussed problems related to mother and child health. This was 
followed, in the same place, by another seminar organized by 
UNICEF, the Kazakhstan Ministry of Health and the Bobek 
Children's Charitable Fund. This time, the talks revolved around 
the subject of a program of controlling pneumonia among children 
in Kazakhstan. What prompted such representative meetings of 
physicians in Alma-Ata? At the newspaper's request, Aman 
Duysekeyev, deputy health minister of the Republic of 
Kazakhstan, shared his thoughts: 
  First, let me cite some figures: in our republic 40 children 
are born per hour, but there is also one death per hour, which 
is indicative of high infant mortality. Analysis of child 
morbidity revealed that it has risen everywhere. For example, 
the highest incidence of infectious diseases is noted in 
Kzyl-Orda and Mangistau oblasts, and the city of Alma-Ata. Most 
often, blood and hemopoietic organ diseases are detected in the 
above-mentioned oblasts, as well as Semipalatinsk Oblast. In our 
opinion, the rise in morbidity among tots is related, first of 
all, to the poor ecological situation in this republic and 
worsening of the people's socio-economic status. 
  Infant mortality is one of the most sensitive indicators of 
socio-economic development of society, which comprises the 
educational and cultural level, condition of the environment, 
efficacy of preventive measures, medicogenetic consultations, 
availability and quality of medical care, distribution of social 
and material wealth. It has been established that the highest 
indictors of infant mortality are observed in oblasts with a 
high birthrate, since they have the poorest obstetric and 
pediatric care resources, and lowest per capita consumption of 
basic foods. And this enables us to conclude that planning of 
resource capabilities of mother and child care services was 
carried out for many years without consideration of the regional 
distinctions (in the sense of high or low birthrate). True, for 
the last few years emphasis has been placed on the regional 
conception of distribution of resources. But the difficult 
socio-economic situation, reduction in funds allocated to 
medicine from the State budget have diminished the capacity to 
carry out the work that was begun. Yet we are dealing with 
children. Today, more than ever, safeguarding their health 
requires effective government support. 
  What else causes infant mortality? Studies carried out by 
the 
Kazakh Scientific research Institute of Pediatrics show that the 
more abortions are used as a birth control method, the higher 
the gynecological pathology, the more often there are 
complications of pregnancy, considerable share of premature 
infants, while the risk of infant mortality increases 20-fold. 
The physical condition and morbidity rate of children, 
particularly in infancy, is also directly related to how they 
are fed. Yet requirements such as keeping mother and infant 
together in maternity homes, and immediate nursing of the infant 
are not followed actively enough in Kazakhstan. And this can 
ultimately lead to catastrophic rise in number of infants 
deprived of maternal milk. Even now, in this republic only half 
the infants up to the age of 3 months and one-third of those up 
to 6 months old are breast fed. This cannot fail to cause alarm. 
Especially since the prognosis is depressing, since Kazakhstan 
does not have its own baby food industry, and support of breast 
feeding involves major socioeconomic difficulties. 
  In most of the world's nations, including CIS states, 
prevention and treatment of respiratory diseases is one of the 
pressing socio-medical problems. In our republic, for example, 
bronchopulmonary pathology among children constitutes more than 
64 percent of all diseases. Thus, the rise in incidence of acute 
pneumonia among tots in Atyrau, Zhezkazgan, Kzyl-Orda and South 
Kazakhstan oblasts is attributable to inadequate supply of 
necessary equipment to the roentgenological service, 
difficulties in making the exact diagnosis, and problems of 
professional training of pediatricians, particularly on the 
primary level. 
  The high incidence of pathology of respiratory organs among 
children is related not only to unsolved medical, but also 
socioeconomic, ecological and ethnic problems. For this reason, 
only a comprehensive approach is needed to solve this problem. 
In recent years, many scientists have concluded that it is 
important to instruct mothers on first medicosanitary aid. As 
shown by studies, the education of moms was instrumental in 
establishing a health lifestyle, expanding knowledge about acute 
respiratory infections, and helped lower infant mortality by 29 
percent. Consequently, we consider primary prevention and 
hygienic education of the public to be the chief role of 
out-patient and polyclinic institutions. 
  At this stage of economic and social transformations, and 
with changing demographic processes, the most important task to 
health care practice is to preserve the life of every infant. 
And I should like to state through AZIYA, which devoted a page 
in its preceding issue to the problem of mother and child health 
the following: everything we discussed above will be only a good 
intention unless funding of health care in Kazakhstan is carried 
out on the basis of scientifically validated forecasts and more 
generous investment in programs that guarantee the health of 
children and women.

<F P=106> [Article by Zoya Korneyeva and Dinara Shugabayeva (AZIYA </F>
correspondents): ``The Health of Women is the Health of the 
Nation''; first three paragraphs are AZIYA introduction ] 
  [Excerpts]Pregnancy and birth of a child must be not only 
usual, natural, but also virtually safe and definitely joyous 
events. However, statistics show that this is far from true in 
many developing countries. Each year, about a million women die 
of complications arising during pregnancy and parturition. In 
the same countries, 10 million children die each year, and about 
half of them in the first month of life. Many children expire of 
the same complications that killed their mothers. These 
complications are directly related to the condition of maternity 
institutions, general physical condition of mothers and their 
diet even before they become pregnant. 
  As we have already reported, there was a seminar in the 
middle of January in Alma-Ata dealing with mother and child 
health. The US Agency for International Development (USAID) 
sponsored this seminar. The seminar assembled more than 70 
Central Asian health care workers and many prominent foreign 
specialists. The purpose of the seminar was to learn and 
exchange information with participants from the United States 
and Central Asia about the latest facts on matters of mother and 
child care, nursing and family planning. 
  This is what the seminar participants told AZIYA 
correspondents. 
Aman DYUSEKEYEV, deputy health minister of Kazakhstan: 
  In our republic, the index of women's health is dropping 
each 
year. Last year it constituted about 30 percent. This means that 
only 30 women out of 100 are in good health. Out of 1000 infants 
born, 146 are sick. Respiratory organ diseases are in first 
place, parasitic diseases in second, and nervous system diseases 
in third. The adverse ecological situation and deteriorating 
financial status of the people have an adverse impact. We are in 
second place among CIS states with respect to birthrate. In our 
republic there are 67.2 maternal deaths per 100,000 deliveries. 
Of this number, 38 die of abortions. Infant mortality is high in 
Shymkent, Semipalatinsk, Zhambyl and Kzyl-Orda oblasts. These 
indicators are considerably lower in northern oblasts. At 
present, development of a 5-year program to lower infant and 
mother mortality is being finalized in our republic. The 
government of the Kazakhstan Republic has spent much money to 
purchase drugs. In the summer, there will be a conference in 
Alma-Ata on the problem of diarrhea. 
Nina KAYUPOVA, director of Republic Research Center for 
Mother and Child Care: 
  Our Center, along with other research institutions of 
Kazakhstan, has carried out sampling studies. As a result, it 
was found that morbidity is very high among women in the region 
of Aral, Semipalatinsk, and oblasts with a large chemical 
industry -- Pavlodar, Zhambyl. The poor ecological situation is 
in first place among the causes of disease, child and mother 
mortality. We have developed a program to lower maternal 
morbidity and mortality which considers all risk factors. The 
heterogeneity of indicators of morbidity and mortality made it 
necessary to elaborate differentiated preventive and therapeutic 
measures to lower them. Kazakhstan is divided into four regions 
according to indicators of maternal mortality: low, average, 
above average, and high. Thus, the indicator is high in Shymkent 
and Alma-Ata oblasts, and in the city of Alma-Ata. It is low in 
Ural and North Kazakhstan oblasts. It should be noted that the 
quality of medical care plays a part in solving the problem of 
prevention of maternal death and morbidity. It is very obvious 
that we need to improve training and retraining of medical 
personnel. We are particularly alarmed by hereditary and 
congenital pathology of neonates. To solve this problem, a 
network of medicogenetic consultation offices has been organized 
in Kazakhstan. In our republic, much is being done to safeguard 
mother and child health: several laws have been passed that are 
aimed at improvement of labor safety and everyday life of women; 
institutions of a new type have been build -- perinatal centers, 
new maternity homes and gynecological consultation offices have 
been opened.

  [Text]Sergey PUGACH, scientific associate at the Kazakh 
Scientific Research Institute of Pediatrics: 
  In Kazakhstan, mortality of infants and very young children 
is an important problem. Infectious pathology is one of the 
chief causes of maternal mortality and child mortality. Southern 
and western regions are characterized by higher infectious 
morbidity and mortality among children up to 3 years old. On the 
whole, in the republic, intestinal infections are in first 
place, sepsis in second, and meningococcal infection in third. 
The high morbidity level is related to unsatisfactory 
development of the social infrastructure, poor sanitation of 
populated centers, particularly rural ones, flaws in 
organization of potable water supply to the public, absence and 
unsatisfactory operation of sewer systems, water treatment 
installations, and inadequate role of the sanitary and 
epidemiological service. 
  The leading risk factors of mortality are medical 
organizational which are controllable (68.7 percent), then 
social (16.1) and biological (15.3). The most important medical 
organizational factors are: incomplete examination, lack of 
regularity in preventive observation, lack of urgent therapy at 
the prehospital stage and laboratory tests, extremely serious 
condition of patients when admitted, which is related to late 
hospitalization. The leading social factors reflect the 
sociodemographic distinctions of the region studied: large 
families (housewife mother), low level of mother's education, 
flaws in child care (no massage or exercise). The prevalent 
biological factors are: physical condition of the mother 
(anemia), inadequate postpartum rehabilitation related to short 
intervals between pregnancies, which is also the cause of low 
weight of the child. In all regions as a whole, 67.1 percent of 
deaths were deemed preventable. 
Lyudmila RYBALKINA, deputy director of the Kyrgyz 
Scientific Research Institute of Obstetrics and Pediatrics: 
  In our republic, infant mortality is high, 31.7 per 1000 
births. Maternal mortality constitutes 71 per 100,000 
deliveries. There are many causes involved and, first of all, 
the initially poor physical condition of women of child-bearing 
age which, in turn, is attributable to the difficult ecological 
situation and overuse of chemicals in the soil. Our women work 
in cotton and tobacco raising regions. One often observes women 
nursing infants right under the tobacco-drying awning. The 
Institute of Obstetrics and Pediatrics carried out studies in 
regions where there is particularly intensive use of pesticides 
and chemicals to stimulate growth of crop. We took blood and 
milk samples for testing from pregnant and nursing women. We 
found a close correlation between physical condition and 
environmental pollution. For example, 16 percent of the girls 
presented retarded sexual and physical development, 20 percent 
of the women revealed instances of sterility and premature 
delivery of infants. In such regions, the children suffered from 
hypotrophy. 
Talaybek BUYLASHEV, deputy director of the Kyrgyz 
Scientific Research Institute of Obstetrics and Gynecology: 
  In our republic, as a rule, the number of children desired 
was born to the detriment of the mother. In 70 percent of the 
cases, mothers of many children suffered from anemia, 
parturition-related hemorrhages, and late toxicosis. In 
Kyrgyzstan, in urban areas, 30 percent of the women are 
multipara, and in rural areas, they constitute 50-55 percent. 
About one-third of the number of annual maternal deaths is 
referable to multipara from socially deprived families. In our 
republic, abortion has been the main form of family planning. 
There were 48 abortions per 100 births. The ethnic lifestyle 
distinctions made it necessary to search for new approaches to 
sociomedical aid to the family. For this reason, a new family 
planning and social protection service was created in Kyrgyzstan 
in 1989. The tasks for this service are to plan families and 
disseminate information about a healthy lifestyle, education, 
social and legal protection of families in the risk group. Of 
course, we realize that every family should decide on its own 
how many children it must have. But there must be an interval of 
2.5-3 years between them. At present, there are more than 56 
family planning centers in this republic. Maternal mortality has 
dropped from 81.6/100,000 births in 1990 to 76.4 in 1991. There 
has been a drop to one-third in percentage of women who give 
birth after the age of 30 years. 
Khamgeldy MAMEDOV, deputy health minister of 
Turkmenistan: 
  We have the highest mortality rate, as compared to other 
regions of Central Asia. The chief cause is the high birthrate. 
More than 80 percent of Turkmen women of child-bearing age are 
sick. Seventy percent of the pregnant women are anemic. The 
indicator of respiratory and intestinal diseases is very high. 
The ecological situation in the republic is poor. Tashauz and 
two rayons are in the Zone of the Aral disaster. Toxic chemicals 
that were used at one time are undermining the health of women. 
We raise a cotton monoculture, which requires an enormous volume 
of manual female labor. There are no healthy women wherever 
cotton is raised. This means that there are no healthy offspring 
either. The water shortage in some regions and lack of municipal 
services are also devastating factors. 
  In our region, servicing rural health care is an urgent 
matter, since the highest percentage of deaths is referable to 
residents of rural areas. It is difficult for Americans to 
comprehend that, for us, the main thing is to improve the 
material and technical base, and specialists. While in the 
United States midwives manage to perform their duties very well, 
in or country, the physician replaces both a midwife and nurse. 
We are also experiencing a severe scarcity of information. Nor 
are all opportunities used to run campaigns for a health 
lifestyle. 
  Free nutrition has been organized in Turkmenistan for pupils 
in the 1st-4th grades. Free drugs are furnished for infants up 
to 1 year old. Women are given 140 calendar days of leave before 
and after parturition, and the term is increased by 16 days for 
those with pathology. 
Svetlana NARZYKULOVA, chief obstetrician-gynecologist of 
the Uzbek Ministry of Health: 
  Of all women, the Asian woman is probably in poorest health, 
since the intervals between her children are the shortest. Our 
women give birth twice a year. About 70 percent of them suffer 
from extragenital pathology, and the lion's share is represented 
by anemia. 
  Women and children work in cotton fields, yet cotton 
contains 
many toxic chemicals. Not to mention the heavy labor involved in 
picking cotton. There is persistence of many toxic chemicals, 
which break down under the open sky. Hence the high levels of 
pesticides in mother's milk and the low frequency of breast 
feeding. As it is everywhere else, the ecological situation is 
``sounding an alarm.'' Uzbekistan has its own Chernobyl, the 
Aral zone. 
  As yet, maternal mortality is still high, but there has been 
a trend toward decline in recent years. Thus, while it 
constituted 73.3 in 1990, it was 65.3 in 1991, and according to 
estimates for 11 months, it dropped to 51/100,000 viviparous 
women last year. In 1991-1992, we carried out a program entitled 
``Urgent measures to improve the health of fertile women (from 
15 to 49 years old),'' because we have a large group of 
multipara. Teams equipped with the necessary instruments 
traveled to rural mountainous regions. General practitioners and 
gynecologists made observations. The women who required skilled 
care were referred to central medical institutions. 
D. ASADOV, director of the Uzbek Scientific Research 
Institute of Obstetrics and Gynecology: 
  Until recently, there were four countries in the world that 
did not support the campaign for family planning. They included 
the former Soviet Union. For this reason, it is quite 
understandable that we are just learning about a concept such as 
``family planning.'' Are our people ready for family planning? 
At present, such terminology is not grasped in Uzbekistan. 
Evidently, planning in different industries in former years left 
its negative impact. We call it ``improving the health of 
children and mothers.'' First of all, our institute polled 
public opinion, men and women separately. Ten years ago, 70 
percent of the women and 100 percent of the men believed that a 
family should have 6-7 children or, as they say, ``as many as 
God gives us.'' Today, 55 percent of the women agree that there 
should be 2-3 children in a family. This is the belief of 
Muslims: Uzbek, Kazakh, Tajik and Kara-Kalpak women. More than 
50 percent of the men believe that there should be 3-4 children. 
Contraceptives are already used by 80 percent of the women and 
50 percent of the men. The population is morally ready to grasp 
the concept of family planning. At present we are, so to speak, 
rethinking our ideology, because the issue is still new to us.

  [Text]Child health has always been a problem of paramount 
importance to Russia. Under present conditions of profound 
economic crisis, it causes justified alarm, not only on the part 
of physicians, but also each sensible person concerned about the 
fate of his country. 
  The health status of children, and levels of a number of 
demographic indicators are a barometer of socio-economic 
development of a territory. Infant mortality (number of deaths 
at up to 1 year of age per 1000 live births) is one of the most 
sensitive health indicators, and it is related to many causes: 
social, ecological, ethnic and a number of others. The former 
USSR was in the lead among economically developed countries of 
the world in infant mortality: this indicator constituted 
21.8/1000 in 1990 [9]. In the same period, infant mortality in 
Japan was only 4 cases per 1000 live births, it was 6 to 9 in 
West Europe, and 10 in the United States [6]. This indicator is 
highest in African countries (179 in Gambia, 105 in Nigeria), as 
well as Turkey (79) [19]. In the opinion of WHO experts, infant 
mortality in excess of 50/1000 begins to have a slowing effect 
on development of a nation [16]. 
  In the former USSR, infant mortality presented vivid 
territorial differences: in 1989 it was 10.7/1000 in Lithuania, 
54.7 in Turkmenia, and 17.8 in RSFSR [6]. 
  For a long time, infant mortality was rather high in all 
parts of West Siberia, but in the last 10 years it was close to 
the republic mean (Table 1). The rate of decline diminished in 
the last few years. Evidently, organizational and medical 
measures alone are not enough; there must be development and 
implementation of a set of health-improving programs, first of 
all, sociohygienic and ecological ones.

  The lowest infant mortality is noted in Altay and the 
highest, in Kemerovo Oblast. This difference is related first of 
all to the ecologically adverse situation in the Kuznetsk Coal 
Basin and the fact that many women work under difficult 
industrial conditions that are deleterious to health. Altay Kray 
is thus far the ecologically best territory of West Siberia. 
  There are also differences between urban and rural areas 
with 
regard to infant mortality rates: in 1990, this indicator 
constituted 17.3/1000 in cities of the Russian Federation and 
18.9 in rural areas [6]. On the whole, the same ratio prevails 
in West Siberia. 
  In most cases (85-90 percent), infant mortality in the 
Russian Federation is attributable to four classes of causes: 
infectious diseases (class I), diseases of respiratory organs 
(class VIII), congenital developmental defects (class XIV) and 
conditions arising in the perinatal period (class XV). In the 
last 10 years, there were some major changes in the structure of 
infant mortality (Table 2). In 1980, in the Russian Federation 
there was prevalence of respiratory organ disease among causes 
of infant death and in 1990, perinatal pathology.

  In the structure of causes of perinatal mortality in Russia 
(number of infant deaths in the period from 28th week of 
gestation period to 7 days after birth per 1000 live and still 
births), asphyxia is in first place (51 percent), respiratory 
disorders are in 2d (18 percent), congenital defects in 3d (13 
percent), and birth trauma in 4th (8 percent) [2]. In 1988 there 
was a large number of term infants among those who died in the 
perinatal period -- 52 percent. In developed countries this 
indicator does not exceed 25 percent [2]. In the last 10 years, 
perinatal mortality rate also rose in the West Siberian region. 
It rose from 13/1000 in 1982 to 21/1000 in 1990 in Novosibirsk 
Oblast. 
  The structure of infant mortality in West Siberia as a whole 
is the same as in the Russian Federation. While the leading 
cause of infant death here was respiratory disease in 1980 
(37-43 percent), with infectious diseases in 2d-3d place (16-23 
percent), in 1990 perinatal pathology advanced to first place 
(34-50 percent) and congenital defects in 2d; respiratory 
disease moved to 3d place and infectious diseases, to 4th. These 
data confirm the conclusion that there is a decline in reserve 
for lowering infant mortality due to exogenous causes, which 
could be considered arbitrarily eliminated (respiratory and 
infectious diseases). 
  Analysis of the causes of infant mortality in urban and 
rural 
areas of West Siberia shows rather significant structural 
differences. Although there was prevalence in 1980 of 
respiratory, infectious diseases and perinatal pathology among 
causes of infant death in cities, by 1990 the structure of 
infant mortality began to correspond to the republic mean. In 
rural areas, the findings were different. In 1980, respiratory 
disease was very prominent among causes of rural infant death in 
the West Siberian region (47 to 57 percent), and in 1990 this 
class of causes was in one of the leading places (2d place in 
Kemerovo and Novosibirsk oblasts, 3d in Altay Kray and Omsk 
Oblast). The share of infectious diseases dropped in 10 years to 
1/2-2/3. As was the case everywhere, the percentage of perinatal 
pathology rose in rural areas of West Siberia, and in 1990 this 
class of causes advanced to first place; however, as compared to 
urban areas, the share of rural perinatal pathology was not as 
great (29-38 percent in rural areas versus 38-53 percent in 
cities). Thus, in rural parts of West Siberia, respiratory 
diseases are still a rather serious problem. 
  The mortality rate for children up to 14 years of age is 
also 
higher in our country than in other economically developed 
nations [22]. 
  In the structure of child mortality (up to 14 years) in the 
Russian Federation, congenital developmental defects are in one 
of the first places, and their incidence has increased 
appreciably in recent years, constituting 28.3/1000. In essence, 
this refers to defects of the musculoskeletal system (27 
percent), gastrointestinal tract (17.5 percent) and 
cardiovascular system (17.5 percent). Analysis of postmortem 
findings data revealed that, on the whole, the incidence of 
congenital defects in children up to 14 years old constitutes 
25.8 percent. This is considerably higher than in the 
population, and it is indicative of the extremely important role 
of congenital defects in thanatogenesis [17]. 
  One of the most pressing pediatric problems is pathology of 
the CNS [central nervous system]. In 1989, there were more than 
300,000 children with organic CNS pathology, including 122,000 
with infantile cerebral paralysis, who were under dispensary 
supervision in medical institutions of the former USSR. In the 
last 10 years, the number of children with such pathology 
tripled. At the present time, the incidence of organic diseases 
of the nervous system among children up to 14 years old 
constitutes 30.6/1000. In their structure, 36 percent refers to 
pre- and perinatal encephalopathy, 24 percent to infantile 
cerebral paralysis, 19 percent to the convulsion syndrome, 10 
percent to neuroinfection, 9 percent to sequelae of birth 
trauma, and 2 percent to hereditary diseases [11]. 
  In the first 3 years of life, perinatal CNS lesions 
constitute about 70 percent of all neurological pathology and in 
older children, about 50 percent. Asphyxia and birth trauma are 
the most frequent causes of neurological disease. In the overall 
structure of postnatal pathology, the share of which increases 
from 3 percent in the first year to 56 percent in children of 
school age, most (39 percent) consists of borderline diseases 
(neurasthenic syndrome, enuresis) [11]. 
  According to data of the Novosibirsk Oblast Health 
Department, in 1990 the incidence of mental illness per 1000 
child population constituted 26 cases, there being 1.7 cases of 
infantile cerebral paralysis and 2 of epilepsy. 
  Respiratory disease is among the most frequent causes of 
childhood morbidity and mortality. It constitutes 77 percent of 
all pathology encountered in infants 1 to 3 years old. In 
children attending preschool institutions respiratory disease is 
recorded 3 times more often. This refers primarily to acute 
viral respiratory infections, nasopharyngitis, influenza, 
bronchitis and sore throat [8]. 
  In the Russian Federation the incidence of chronic pneumonia 
among children up to 14 years old constitutes 0.5-0.9/1000 and 
bronchial asthma, 4-9/1000. At the same time, according to N. A. 
Bogdanov et al. [5], the incidence of chronic nonspecific lung 
diseases in children of rural areas is 8-9 percent, while the 
threat of their development applies to 24.5 percent of the 
children. In 1990, the incidence of chronic pneumonia 
constituted 4, chronic bronchitis 2, and bronchial asthma 3 
cases per 1000 child population of Novosibirsk oblast. 
  Cardiovascular diseases are among the key pediatric 
problems. 
Their incidence per 100,000 child population of Russia is as 
follows: 342 for congenital heart defects, 40 for primary 
rheumatic disease, 140 for recurrent rheumatism, 20-30 for 
rhythm disturbances, 30 for various forms of arthritis, 10-20 
for myocarditis, and 5-14 for hypertensive states [4]. In recent 
years, hypotensive states began to be noted in adolescents more 
often than hypertensive ones. Arterial pressure was 90/40 mm Hg 
or lower in every fifth adolescent [14]. 
  An All-Union study of precursors of atherosclerosis in 
children and adolescents, which was carried out in the 
mid-1980s, revealed that 80 percent of school-age children had 
some risk factor or other for development of cardiovascular 
disease. The incidence of such risk factors among Novosibirsk 
schoolchildren was as follows: hypodynamia 64 percent, 
dyslipoproteinemia 41 percent, obesity 16 percent, smoking 8 
percent, arterial hypertension 6 percent [20]. A recheck of the 
same children 5 years later revealed that the situation had 
become even more serious: incidence of arterial hypertension 
rose to 11 percent (among young boys) and hypodynamia to 83 
percent (among young girls); the incidence of obesity rose to 30 
percent, and there was a significant rise in percentage of 
habitual smokers, to 50 among young boys and 26 among young 
girls [21]. 
  In recent years, there has been a rise in number of children 
with digestive diseases of noninfectious etiology. While in 
1975, 70-75 cases were recorded per 1000 child population of the 
Russian Federation, in 1989 there were already 100-110 [12]. In 
the structure of digestive diseases, pathology of the 
gastroduodenal zone is in 1st place (51-57 percent), diseases of 
bile ducts are in 2d (24-37 percent), and intestinal pathology 
in 3d (7-16 percent) [15]. 
  Acute intestinal infections are recorded annually in 65-70 
percent of the children [13]. In 51 percent of the cases their 
etiology is unknown, in 33 percent the diagnosis is shigellosis, 
in 12 percent enteritis of diverse etiology, in 3 percent 
typhoid fever and paratyphoid, and in 2 percent Yersinia 
infection. The age breakdown for acute intestinal infections is 
as follows: 58 percent 0-2 years, 25 percent 3-6 years, and 17 
percent 7-14 years. The prime cause of the adverse situation 
with regard to acute intestinal infections in Russia is related, 
first of all, to the unsatisfactory condition of water supply 
and quality of drinking water. In children, intestinal 
infections are often related to consumption of tainted food, 
particularly dairy products [13]. 
  Among children over 1 year old, mortality due to malignant 
pathology is in 2 place, after accidents. In the structure of 
causes of death due to malignant pathology, lymphatic and 
hemopoietic tissue tumors are in 1st place (53 percent) among 
children, other nosological forms (bone, connective tissue and 
urinary tract organ tumors 5 percent, digestive organ tumors 4 
percent, tumors of the buccal cavity and throat 1.3 percent) are 
encountered much less often [1]. 
  The incidence of diseases of the urinary system among the 
child population of the Russian Federation constitutes 3/1000 
[7]. There is prevalence of bacterial and inflammatory 
processes. Infection of the urinary tract is encountered in 33 
percent of the cases, and various forms of pyelonephritis in 48 
percent. Glomerulonephritis is encountered in 8 percent of the 
children with diseases of the urinary system; congenital and 
hereditary nephropathy, in 7 percent. There are distinctive 
features in urinary system pathology among children residing in 
different parts of Russia. For example, there is prevalence of a 
distinctive renal syndrome following hemorrhagic fever in the 
Far East, and latent nephropathy in the region of the 
Baykal-Amur highway [7]. In 1990, the incidence of urinary 
system pathology per 1000 child population of Novosibirsk Oblast 
constituted 1.8 cases. 
  Diabetes mellitus is not often encountered in childhood, but 
there are always clinical manifestations. In 1988, the incidence 
of this pathology per 100,000 child population of the Russian 
Federation constituted 32.7 cases, and new cases of diabetes 
6.3. There are considerable regional differences in incidence of 
this disease among children. Its incidence is high among the 
child population of Moscow and St. Petersburg (45-54 cases per 
100,000 children), and low in Tyumen Oblast (12.4 cases) [10]. 
This indicator is close to the mean for Russia (30.0) in 
Novosibirsk Oblast. 
  The indicators of health status of the child population 
depend largely on condition of the environment. In ecologically 
adverse regions, childhood morbidity is 1.5-2 times higher than 
in other regions. There is a higher risk of development of 
congenital defects, perinatal pathology, the nervous and 
endocrine systems are strongly affected: earlier puberty and 
taller height are noted among children living near chemical 
enterprises [22]. 
  In regions where aluminum plants are located, the incidence 
of diseases of the nervous and urinary systems is 2-3 times 
higher than the statistical mean. In Altay Kray, hemolytic 
anemia of a chemical nature is noted in more than 100 neonates. 
In Angarsk, there was a higher incidence of bronchial asthma and 
bronchitis among children, as a result of exposure to waste from 
a local protein and vitamin concentrate plant. In regions 
exposed to radiation following the disaster at the Chernobyl 
Nuclear Power Plant, there was a change in course of diseases, a 
tendency toward longer and more severe course of 
bronchopulmonary and renal diseases [3]. 
  Russian physicians are quite alarmed by the health status of 
schoolchildren: 53% of the children of school age are in poor 
health and 58 percent had restrictions for health reasons in 
choosing an occupation after graduation. There is a distinct 
tendency toward rise in incidence of obesity, myopia, mental 
disorders, flat foot, and allergic diseases. More than 33 
percent of the schoolchildren have some sort of chronic disease, 
most often of digestive organs, nasopharynx, and allergies. The 
number of schoolchildren in good health does not exceed 25-30 
percent. Over the period of their schooling, the number of 
healthy children drops to 1/4-1/5 [18]. 
  Thus, all of the foregoing is indicative of the serious 
situation with regard to physical condition of children in 
Russia, due not only to the economic crisis, social upheavals 
and ecological disturbances. It is imperative to radically alter 
the entire system of mother and child care, devoting special 
attention to family medicine and prevention, increasing by many 
times the financing of pediatric hospitals and schools, since 
all expenses would result in health of the nation.

comment] 
  [Text] The sanitary and epidemiological condition in the 
institutions of public health, trade and public catering is now 
open to criticism, and in some places simply catastrophic. 
  The scientific-production association engaged in 
interplanetary flights realizing the need to urgently mend the 
situation and assess soberly its prospects in the market of 
medical equipment, has started the production of equipment for 
disinfection. 
  The equipment enjoys success but, according to Marina 
Polyakova, head of the marketing department of the Kront company 
set up by the scientific-production association, because of 
money shortage many medical institutions cannot afford such 
equipment. Therefore, the newly-fledged businessmen decided to 
simply give them several of the new instruments. For instance, 
the International Mother-and-Child Care Fund and the St. 
Petersburg Children's Home received EKO installations for 
preparing disinfectant solutions and plastic boxes for the 
treatment of medical instruments. 
  The value of the gifts (about 2.5 million roubles) is not so 
high according to the present standards, but the precedent is 
important: among sponsors is the world-famous, but no longer 
wealthy space company which actually does not get allocations 
from the budget for its conversion and itself experiences 
serious financial difficulties.

<F P=106> [Article by E. G. Chikirdin, Moscow Research Institute of </F>
Diagnostics and Surgery, Russian Ministry of Health, under the 
rubric: ``Help for Medical Practitioners''] 
  [Text]In 1992, seven items of x-ray equipment underwent 
clinical trials and were recommended by the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Health for series production. First of all, we 
should mention the Obraz-2 [Image] magnetic resonance tomograph 
(developed and manufactured by the Agregat AO [Joint Stock 
Company], Moscow), which will replace the preceding model, 
Obraz-1 that was produced in series. The tomograph has a 0.14 T 
resistance magnet (instead of 0.12 T as in Obraz-1), which 
produces an image with higher resolution. At the same time, the 
cost of the product has also risen (from 18 to 27 million 
rubles). 
  A phantom kit (from the Ekran [Screen] NPO 
[Research-Production Association]) has been developed and is 
being manufactured for monitoring and adjusting the magnetic 
resonance tomographs. 
  The x-ray diagnostic unit, Rentgen-47 (Sevkavrentgen plant, 
Kabardino-Balkariya), which has a 3-phase, 6-pulse, 125 kV, 800 
mA power pack, and two interchangeable No.1 and No.3 cradles, 
which are ordered by the user, is designed to examine children. 
The unit is equipped with a turntable and film holder, which are 
the same as in the Rentgen-40 series of units. 
  Kruiz, a flat x-ray image amplifier, has been developed 
(Special Design and Technological Office for Medical X-ray 
Equipment, an affiliate of the Mosrentgen AO) to obtain 150-fold 
enhancement of screen brightness. However, its contrast index is 
not high enough (0.8 versus the desirable value of 0.9), which 
makes it necessary to work in a darkened room. 
  The ARS-2 film-taking x-ray unit (Mosrentgen AO) has a 
3-phase, 6-pulse, 125 kV, 800 MA power pack with microprocessor 
control (Reneks 50-6-2 power pack). It is equipped with a 
refined film table with a Storens tomography attachment and 
Stors film holder. The unit has passed clinical trials at the 
Moscow Research Institute of Diagnostics and Surgery. 
  An improved quality of x-rays and tomograms is obtained with 
the kit for optimum x-ray filtration (Ekran NPO, Moscow), which 
consists of compensation wedges with different configurations 
that are transparent to visible light and placed at the end of 
the depth collimator. 
  The AIRM VR (Neftepromavtomatika [Oil Industry Automation] 
NPO, Kazan), an automated interactive roentgenologist's work 
station, reduces time and enhances quality of roentgenological 
findings. It also puts out automatically the mean radiation dose 
to the patient over the examination time, and records the number 
and format of films. 
  There are many other developments that are close to 
completion, about which we will make an additional report.

  [Abstract] Reproductive follow-up studies were conducted on 
164 men that had been engaged in cleanup efforts at the 
Chernobyl nuclear power plant. External exposure levels of these 
22-50 year old men were reported not to have exceeded 25 cGy. 
The protocols involved questionnaires and, in the case of 125 of 
the men, laboratory examinations of semen samples. The findings 
indicated that one third of the men suffered from various 
degrees of impotence. In addition, 21% presented with 
chronic 
prostatovesiculitis, azoospermia, oligozoospermia, or 
asthenospermia. Thus, impotence and infertility should also be 
included on the list of medical complications that are being 
monitored in the the Chernobyl cleanup personnel. Tables 1;

  [Text]In spite of the expanded production of 
microassemblies that find application in the manufacture of 
electronic equipment, a complete description of their 
reliability under various ecological conditions has not yet been 
compiled. One of its indicators is resistance to fungi, which 
can be examined in direct relationship to properties of a 
material and their changes under the effect of various factors, 
including extreme ones (Astafyev, 1966; Flerov, 1972; 
Gerasimenko, 1984; Lugauskas et al., 1987). There are virtually 
no data on fungus resistance of thin- and thick-film elements of 
microassemblies used extensively in electronics (Blagnik, 
Zanova, 1965; Andreyuk et al., 1980; Gerasimenko, 1984; 
Kanevskaya, 1984; Zaikina, Yelinov, 1985; Koval, Sidorenko, 
1989). Yet the structure of assembly materials and data on low 
fungus resistance of some of them warrant the assumption that 
microassemblies are vulnerable to fungi, particularly when used 
in regions with high humidity, as well as in tropical and 
subtropical climates. 
  This article deals with a discussion of the results of 
studying fungus resistance of thin- and thick-film elements of 
microassemblies under model conditions. 
  We tested fungus resistance of microassemblies consisting of 
thick-film elements based on various pastes -- resistance, 
condenser, conductor, dielectric insulation and condenser, as 
well as thin-film elements based on resistance and dielectric 
alloys listed in the table.

Note: Assessment of fungus resistance: numerator -- fungus resistance of microassemblies, 
denominator -- resistance of underlayer. Viability of conidia: applied conidia showing no 
growth on specimens. Condensate rating: 1) few large drops that fall off readily; 2) numerous 
medium-sized drops, almost stationary; 3) small drops over the entire specimen, stationary. 


  The tests for fungus resistance were carried out in 
accordance with GOST 9.048...9.053-75 (with 1986 supplements). 
We used fungus strains isolated from specimens of analogous 
composition that had undergone field tests in different climate 
zones. Isolation, identification, determination of lag phase and 
viability of conidia of tested fungi were carried out by 
conventional techniques (``Methods of Experimental 
Mycology...'', 1982). The tests were repeated 3-5 times. The 
findings were submitted to statistical processing. We assessed 
reliability of difference between experimental variants 
according to Student's criterion at 95 percent level of 
significance. 
  It was impossible to assess unequivocally the fungus 
resistance of the tested thin- and thick-film elements of 
microassemblies in all test variants; it differed and depended 
on a number of factors. 
  The principle of establishing the extent of growth of fungus 
colonies and giving it a score on the 30th day of the experiment 
served as the basis for determination of resistance of the 
materials to fungi (GOST 9.048...9.053-75). There is no special 
GOST [State standard] for microassemblies; however, the 
distinctions of fungal growth on them enable us to discuss the 
need to create one. 
  Microassemblies are a combined substrate consisting of 
variable ceramic or polymer materials in the form of an 
underlayer on which there are metal parts. The two elements of 
this substrate are not quite equal in accessibility to fungi due 
to the physicochemical properties of their surface. Evidently, 
this is what caused the differences in growth processes of 
micromycetes that were noted on the microassemblies. 
  Microassemblies are a specific substrate that does not 
contain the basic agents of mycodestruction essential to vital 
functions: carbon, nitrogen and available water. In this 
respect, metabolic processes of mycodestructive agents have not 
been sufficiently studied, which makes it difficult to analyze 
and assess their growth, and also delays development of 
protective measures. While in bacteria such substrates are 
interpreted as ``nongrowth'' elements and a detailed explanation 
of the possibility of functioning of different species on them 
is available, for fungi a classification of substrates according 
to this criterion has not been developed (Okorokov et al., 1974; 
Malashenko et all., 1982). 
  Investigation of the metabolism of mycodestructors requires 
new, modern approaches that permit deeper examination and 
explanation of the functional capacity of the fungal cell on 
substrates of anthropogenic origin that contain no organic 
matter but permit normal metabolism of heterotrophs (Forster, 
1950; ``The Life of Microbes....,'' 1981). This has become 
particularly urgent at the present time, when basically new data 
are appearing to explain the specific metabolism of 
mycodestructors similarly to what has been established for 
bacteria (Cascelton, 1976; Zonneveld, 1988). For the time being, 
however, it is not deemed possible to explain the growth of 
mycodestructors on microassemblies, and we must limit ourselves 
merely to stating the facts on fungus resistance. 
  In assessing fungus resistance of the tested 
microassemblies, 
we observed differences in fungal growth as a function of the 
structure of their components. Three types of mycodestruction 
can be distinguished: 1) both the underlayer and elements are 
sensitive to fungi, 2) only the underlayer is sensitive to 
fungi, 3) only elements are sensitive to fungi. Most 
fungus-sensitive microassemblies are characterized by fungal 
damage to both components. Fungus growth was observed only on 
the underlayer in elements based on dielectric material DO 
14-30. In resistors based on polymer paste 0650, only the paste 
was subject to mycodestruction. 
  Of all the fungal cultures used to infect microassembly 
specimens, the following formed a film and sporulated normally: 
Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, A. terreus, Paecilomyces 
variotii, Penicillium chrysogenum, P. funiculosum, Trichoderma 
viride. Damage caused by only one fungal species was noted 
in 11 out of the 23 tested specimens, and incidence of fungi 
varied: Aspergillus terreus and Paecilomyces 
variotii developed only on one specimen; Aspergillus 
flavus on three, and A. niger on five. Combined 
damage by two fungal species was observed in five specimens, and 
by three species on one, but we were unable to detect any stable 
link in formation of these complexes. The most eurybiontic 
species also prevailed: A. flavus and A. 
niger. Multicomponent colonies did not differ either 
structurally or in sporulation time. Usually, A. 
flavus was the main background in the film, whereas 
A. niger was arranged in islets in its center. An 
analogous film structure was noted in variants with complexes of 
A. flavus + Paecilomyces variotii, A. flavus + Penicillium 
funiculosum, A. niger + Trichoderma viride. It is only in 
the variant of formation of a two-component film by the A. 
terreus + Penicillium funiculosum complex that their 
colonies were distinctly circumscribed with lumina of 1-2 mm 
between them, which did not disappear with age. This finding can 
be interpreted as a manifestation of antagonism on a certain 
level, which is known for many mycodestructors (Andreyuk et al., 
1980). It is much more difficult to interpret the vulnerability 
of microassemblies to 1-2 fungal species, since joint presence 
of a rather considerable number of species, between which 
syntrophic interactions are established, is more often observed 
when fungi grow on inaccessible substrates (Blagnik, Zanova, 
1965; Koval, Sidorenko, 1989). 
  We were unable to establish any pattern whatsoever or to 
explain the selectivity of fungi in relation to the 
corresponding series of tested specimens. In spite of the fact 
that assessment fungal growth in terms of rating the underlayer 
and microassembly did not always coincide, they were stricken by 
the same species of fungi. However, it must be noted that the 
underlayer played the leading role in manifestation of fungal 
growth in all variants of the experiment. Even in those cases 
where assessment of fungal growth in points almost coincided for 
both microassembly components as, for example, specimens of 
resistance ruthenium pastes 4413, 4451, 4461, conductor 3701, 
dielectric insulation 8031 and dielectric condenser 8021, the 
difference between underlayer and elements with respect to time 
of colony formation and conidial viability was distinctly 
demonstrable. The lag phase was shorter for all tested fungal 
species on the underlayer, whereas maximum growth rating was 
observed at earlier stages. 
  A correlation between fungal growth rating and nature of 
condensate was observed in all specimens. This can be explained 
if we compare the hydrophobic properties of the underlayers 
used. In this instance, the textolite underlayer was highly 
hydrophobic. This was confirmed when we carried out tests 
following a somewhat altered protocol, as compared to GOST, 
according to which the tested microassembly specimens were kept 
in a desiccator for 24 h at 98-100 percent humidity and 
temperature of 15-18Î, following by heating at 26-28ÎC. 
In all specimens, the condensate differed in droplet size, 
quantity and mobility: 1) a small number of large drops, over 
1-1.5 mm in diameter, that rolled off readily; 2) numerous 
droplets 0.5-1 mm in diameter, virtually stationary; 3) numerous 
drops 0.1-0.3 mm in diameter, stationary. The nature of 
condensate distribution on the specimens was analogous to the 
nature of drop formation when the specimens were innoculated 
with conidial suspension. Since moisture is the main factor 
affecting fungal function, in this instance too it was easy to 
track the relationship of fungus resistance to formation of 
condensate and hydrophoby of the microassembly surface. In the 
case of high water repellence of the microassembly surface, the 
drops of condensate or applied conidial suspension were notable 
for larger size and high mobility, which prevents adhesion of 
fungal conidia and, consequently, does not permit their further 
growth. Fungus resistance of resistors based on polymer paste 
0630 with a textolite underlayer indicates that use of 
hydrophobic underlayers can be one of the methods of producing 
microassemblies that are impervious to mycodestruction. 
  Distortion of working parameters of microassemblies was 
observed not only with growth of conidia and formation of fungal 
colonies, but also in the case of a considerable level of 
contamination when the number of conidia exceeded 
10[.sup]6[/]/mm[.sup]2[/]. This can be attributed to the 
effect of metabolic products of conidia that are produced in 
trace amounts even when conidia were in an anabiotic state 
(``Biology of Conidial Fungi,'' 1981). The observed destructive 
processes differed, depending on structure of the underlayer and 
microcircuit, analogously to the experimental variants in which 
colonies were formed. Evidently, evaluation of resistance of 
microassemblies to fungi must be made with consideration of 
several criteria characterizing the physicochemical properties 
of the surface (hydrophoby, porosity, moisture condensation, 
electric charge, etc.), and the assessment should be expressed 
as a fraction, which would correspond to the fungus resistance 
of the underlayer and fungus resistance of the microcircuit. 
  Since the methods used to determine fungus resistance of 
microassemblies do not provide reliable estimate and do not 
permit prediction of reliability of using them under diverse 
ecological conditions, the need arises to develop new models 
that conform better to naturally occurring contamination and 
mycodestruction processes.

comment] 
  [Text] The developments of Moscow researchers lead those of 
their Western counterparts by 3-5 years, say experts. 
  About 50 posts of laser medicine have appeared in Russia 
over 
the past three years. In order to put this branch of public 
health (it is literally occupied by ``healers'' with dubious 
reputation) under control and ensure the professional training 
of physicians the Russian Federation's Ministry of Public Health 
has set up an All-Russia State Research Center with a training 
base on the basis of the Laser Medicine Research Institute. 
  For bloodless dissection of muscular tissue and the 
resection 
of the internal organs (kidneys, gallbladder) the medical 
workers of the State Centre use the Raduga-1 contact aluminium 
laser produced by conversion at the Moscow Polyus 
Scientific-Production Association. The other development project 
of the defence industry--the Raduga-1F laser produced by the 
Istok Scientific-Production Association, near Moscow, is used 
for endocoagulation. 
  Foreign businessmen are greatly interested in the work of 
the 
State Centre. In July a contract was signed on the delivery of 
laser equipment to India, on training Indian doctors in Moscow 
and on setting up a branch of the Centre in Dharwar. 
Negotiations are under way with the representatives of the 
Ministry of Public Health of the Philippines, private clinics 
from Paris and Madrid and the Turkish Asia Ltd, company.

  [Abstract] Results of studies of the features of forming 
the outlines of three-dimensional edges of images are offered 
here for a general case, when the amplitude of the light 
reflection coefficient from its internal surface has a value 
between 0 and 1. This image is referred to as ``gray'' or 
(opaque). The intensity profile of the image front edge outline 
of the gray extended side at different reflection coefficients 
r(0;0.3;07 and 1.0) is shown in graphs for different N: N=2; 
N=1; N=05; N=)1, where N is the number of the Fresnel zone. 
Features of forming the outline of the rear edge of the extended 
side were also examined, demonstrating that in case of 
insignificant volumetric effects, the image resembles the 
contour of a plane edge. However, the coordinates of the 
fundamental minimum do not coincide with the geometric position 
of the object's boundary. With significant volumetric effects, 
the reflecting properties of the internal edge have a 
substantial influence on the structure of the outlined image.
