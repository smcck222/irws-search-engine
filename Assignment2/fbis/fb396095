  [Text] Bangui, 28 Jan (AFP)--Central African Republic [CAR] 
authorities decided this week to ask "those in possession of 
military weapons" to hand them over to the security forces. 
This measure is aimed at "highway robbers," criminals who have 
existed in the country for years. 
  According to a government decision, "those in possession of 
hunting guns and military weapons are requested to deposit them 
at the Gendarmerie, police stations, customs offices, or with 
water resources and forestry officials within one month or face 
coercive measures, it was learned in Bangui today. The 
authorities, who did not explain the nature of the "coercive 
measures," also decided to "suspend the granting of arms and 
ammunition permits until further notice." 
  These measures concern "highway robbers" called "zaraguinas" 
in CAR, who terrorize rural dwellers in several regions of the 
country, notably the border area with Chad. Early this week, 
eight "highway robbers" were killed by the security forces in 
Bossangoa Region, 350 km north of Bangui. Another recent clash 
resulted in the death of seven of them in Vagaka Region, about 
1,000 km east of the capital. Some time ago, the CAR Government 
gave itself three months to stop the activities of the 
zaraguinas, apparently without success.

  [Text] Today sees the celebration in Paris of the 50th 
anniversary of the appeal made in Brazzaville by General De 
Gaulle in 1944. This appeal signaled the beginning of the 
process of French decolonization in Africa. The ceremonies were 
to have been held in Brazzaville, but in the light of the 
current tension in the Congolese capital, they are being held in 
Avenue Kleber in Paris. Congo is represented on this occasion 
by its prime minister, Joachim Yhombi-Opango. Earlier today, he 
spoke to Assane Diop, who began by asking him what the 
Brazzaville appeal meant to him. 
  [Begin recording] [Yhombi-Opango] There is indeed a 
situation 
of insecurity in Brazzaville, or rather in one part of 
Brazzaville. Three areas out of seven are living in a climate of 
insecurity due to the fact that, at one point, some of our 
political colleagues decided to look for a political solution by 
arming their militia's. Congo, however, is not made up of 80,000 
inhabitants, but of 2 million. The rest of the country goes on 
living and working as normal. Having said this, we are 
concerned by the situation in Brazzaville. We have done 
everything for dialogue to prevail. The point about dialogue is 
that it does not bring immediate solutions: one has to be 
patient; one has to enter into constructive dialogue, and wait 
for the results. 
  [Diop] Prime Minister, there have been several attempts at 
dialogue: Gabon has offered its mediation, which led to the 
Libreville accords in August. And yet every time, the violence 
has flared up again. Estimates give more than 200 killed since 
November in Brazzaville alone. For a population of 80,000, that 
is a lot. 
  [Yhombi-Opango] Let us examine the problem rationally. The 
mediation, even that offered by Gabon, was essentially a 
mediation on problems arising from the elections. In other 
words, ensuring that a second round of voting could go ahead, 
which did indeed happen. Today, those people who are holding 
weapons consider that the arbitration college--which was set up 
by the Libreville accords, should announce the results of the 
elections. You have heard some opposition leaders declaring 
that, once the results have been announced, the situation will 
return to normal in Brazzaville. 
  The fundamental problem, therefore, is the problem of power. 
People are fighting because--as President Pascal Lissouba has 
said--their stomachs are speaking. 
  [Diop] Is this to say that President Lissouba, who was in 
power before the elections, has not accepted his defeat? 
  [Yhombi-Opango] The simple reason I can give you is this: If 
he is armed, it is not because his life is in danger. I can 
tell you as prime minister that nobody is threatening either 
President Sassou-Nguesso or President Bernard Kolelas, who is a 
member of the National Assembly. 
  [Diop] Would you agree to hold talks with President Denis 
Sassou-Nguesso. Political conflicts in Africa are often very 
personal. People say that there is a grudge between you and 
President Sassou and vice-versa. Would you agree to hold open, 
rational talks with President Denis Sassou-Nguesso in order to 
put an end to the violence? 
  [Yhombi-Opango] Hold talks yes, but talk about what? 
  [Diop] About peace. 
  [Yhombi-Opango] But everyone wants peace. I am prime 
minister today, because President Pascal Lissouba thought it 
would be useful to appoint me to that position as one of the 
leaders of the presidential group who contributed to the victory 
of the Presidential group in the elections. I am not prime 
minister because I took up arms at some time. What we are 
looking for in the search for peace is respect for the 
institutions that we have set up freely. Now, if we are to talk 
in the context of a normal return to peace, because there are 
differences between one or the other, then we can talk, but as 
responsible politicians. 
  [Diop] If problems were to persist, if dialogue did not lead 
to anything, don't you fear an Algerian-style situation; in 
other words, that there might be a third force, like the 
[Algerian] Higher State Council that was put into place after 
the cancellation of the 1992 elections? Would you not perhaps 
find yourselves back at square one, with the democratic process 
interrupted? 
  [Yhombi-Opango] We have not reached this point. I think that 
in our country there is a state and a government that have a 
duty to protect the security of the people. I would say that we 
are giving dialogue and mediation every possible chance, so that 
everyone understands the necessity of taking part. There will 
come a time, however, when, as the authorities in charge of the 
government, we will have to take every responsibility for 
returning peace to the country. This is the price to pay in the 
building of our country. It is not a sign of weakness to have 
accepted--and the president of the Republic keeps insisting on 
this point--it is not a sign of weakness to seek dialogue. On 
the contrary. If we see that the efforts that we are making 
today do not have the expected results, then the government will 
take its responsibilities. [end recording] 
  That was the Congolese prime minister, Joachim 
Yhombi-Opango. 
He was interviewed by Assane Diop. The representatives in 
France of the Congolese opposition have issued a strong protest 
against the presence of Mr. Opango in Paris. In a communique 
issued today, the Congolese opposition stresses that the fact 
that the commemoration of the Brazzaville Appeal is taking place 
in Paris [rather than Brazzaville] should alert international 
public opinion to the current situation in Congo.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the secretariat of the Presidential </F>
Group; place and date not given] 
  [Text] In his year-end address, the president of the 
Republic announced that he would take the political initiative, 
provided peace was restored in the country. The Presidential 
Group, which salutes this step by the president of the Republic, 
is surprised that Bernard Kolelas, his political family, and the 
international press interpret this initiative by the head of 
state as the expression of his wish to form a national union 
government with which the opposition would be associated. 
  Indeed, in his many statements, the head of the Union for 
Democratic Renewal-Congolese Labor Party [URD-PCT] coalition has 
said that the Congolese political class is actively thinking 
about such a government, thus giving the impression that he has 
discussed the issue with the other political forces in the 
country, notably with the presidential group. The Presidential 
Group, which has the parliamentary majority, the statement 
continues, takes this opportunity to say that it has never 
discussed the formation of a national union government with 
anyone whatsoever. 
  To this end, it is proper to reaffirm the following: The 
Presidential Group is not opposed to the participation of all 
the sons of the Congo in the management of public property 
according to their competence, regardless of their political 
convictions. It is, however, opposed to a party government as 
was the case of [words indistinct] the formation of political 
combinations that will look like a one-party system. On the 
other hand, the Presidential Group is still open to all the sons 
and daughters of the Congo, without exception, who want to 
contribute at all levels, including the governmental one, in the 
reconstruction of the country on the basis of the president's 
program. 
  Furthermore, as the end of the proceedings of the 
international arbitral college--charged by the terms of the 
Libreville accords to examine the electoral dispute--draws near, 
the Presidential Group would like to break the responsible 
silence that it has so far observed so as not to impede the 
delicate work of the college. Regarding this, the Presidential 
Group denounces the feverishness of the opposition and its 
external allies and the manipulation of the opposition, in which 
they pass muster by spreading alarming rumors about the 
imaginary results of the arbitral college. According to them, 
these results allegedly gave them the majority at the National 
Assembly. The statement continues that these habitual tactics 
by the opposition are well known. They are aimed at 
embarrassing the arbitral college and, above all, preparing 
public opinion toward accrediting a thesis of fraud in case the 
decisions of the arbitrators do not tally with their fantasies 
and wishful musings -- in which the URD-PCT coalition excels. 
Finally, the opposition's attitude is aimed at justifying a new 
spate of violence, which they are currently preparing for. 
  The Presidential Group invites all its activists, 
well-wishers, and all the Congolese people to await in calm, 
serenity, and above all, in vigilance the decision of the seven 
international judges who have accepted the delicate task of 
helping our country to peacefully resolve the dispute that 
cropped up in the wake of the by-elections.

  [Excerpt] The killings, terrorism and other bad things that 
have been occurring on in our country, increasingly in Kigali, 
are set to cut short the peace that Rwandans were about to 
enjoy. Last Friday, the Rwandan Government brought a lot of 
arms and ammunition into the country. The UN Mission to Rwanda 
[UNAMIR] is said to have known this and is still waiting for an 
explanation--which is not forthcoming. [passage omitted]. 
  Currently, there is also a plan being carried out against 
UNAMIR using radio RTLM [an FM radio station broadcasting in the 
Kigali area]. It is reported that these same messages are being 
repeated by Kigali Radiodiffusion Nationale de la Republique 
Rwandaise. Their plan is to use terrorism to make the work of 
UNAMIR difficult. 
  As we said before, the Rwandan Government is said to have 
brought in arms last Friday. UNAMIR learned about this and is 
still waiting for an explanation. The Defense Ministry itself 
accepts the fact that it brought arms into the country, contrary 
to the peace agreements, and Rwandans cannot tolerate those who 
want jeopardize these agreements. 
  Meanwhile, the U.S. organization Human Rights Watch has 
recently expressed its concern and has asked the international 
community and all international organizations to stand up and 
stop anything that might bring about a resumption in hostilities 
between the armies of both parties. All this, as you have just 
heard, is because of provocations carried out by the Rwandan 
Government by bringing arms, ammunition, and other military 
equipment into the country, clearly bringing to light a plan to 
cause a war in the country. [passage omitted].

  [Excerpts] At the UN Mission in Rwanda headquarters 
yesterday, there was a meeting between representatives of the 
Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development and 
the Rwandan Patriotic Front. The meeting was chaired by Dr. 
Jacques-Roger Booh Booh, the UN special representative to 
Rwanda. [passage omitted] 
  We would like to inform you that there is tension caused by 
ethnic rivalries in Kigali. People have started fleeing. The 
gendarmerie and government troops are reportedly not useful in 
any way. Instead, citizens in Kigali are asking the UN troops 
to protect them as those of the government are not doing 
anything to protect them.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Romeo Dallaire, UN Assistance </F>
Mission to Rwanda (UNAMIR) commander, by unidentified 
correspondent; place and date not given--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Dallaire] [Words indistinct] attract the 
attention of UNAMIR and the gendarmerie on their concern about 
the security situation in the area, given that people have been 
wounded in the last few days [words indistinct] by hurled 
grenades. 
  So demonstrators stopped vehicles, from which they removed 
people. They injured people and damaged cars. What's more, 
they blocked the road. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] It has been reported that the 
Rwanda Patriotic Front [RPF] left the premises of the National 
Development Council [CND] and shot at demonstrators. What do 
you have to say about this? 
  [Dallaire] This is absolutely untrue. An armed escort of 
the RPF that was accompanying an RPF leader came out of the CND 
to attend a meeting. When they encountered the demonstrators, 
they shot in the air--only in the air--so that they could pass. 
This was done twice. 
  [Correspondent] But it has been said that there were wounded 
people among the demonstrators as a result of the shots fired by 
RPF elements. 
  [Dallaire] This is totally untrue. 
  [Correspondent] So you are saying that no one was wounded? 
  [Dallaire] There was no one wounded as a result of shots by 
the RPF or the gendarmerie. Those wounded were injured by the 
demonstrators because they were [word indistinct] from their 
vehicle to block the road. 
  [Correspondent] What caused the exchange of shots between 
the gendarmerie and RPF elements? 
  [Dallaire] This happened because the RPF was without a 
UNAMIR escort. 
  [Correspondent] People say that the RPF elements operated 
with the complicity of UNAMIR. What is the truth about this, 
General? 
  [Dallaire] Well, I would like them to provide proof [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Correspondent] General, are you planning to ensure that 
such cases do not recur in the area? 
  [Dallaire] [Words indistinct] I hope I will convince the 
prefect of Kigali to [?support] the [?communique] [word 
indistinct] we presented on [?1] January in which we asked him 
to support the gendarmerie chief of staff and ourselves in 
halting demonstrations in the area surrounding the CND premises 
that accommodate the RPF. This is one thing. Second, we are 
[?carrying] a document of [word indistinct] to the RPF that 
reflects our dissatisfaction regarding the procedures that were 
[word indistinct] in the arms consignment area and that were not 
respected this morning. I must also add that we are taking 
measures to meet the local burgomaster and local people to 
explain to them the existing security procedures in the area 
lying between the gendarmerie and UNAMIR.

  [Text] Kinshasa, 31 Jan (AFP) -- The World Bank has decided 
to close its office in Kinshasa as of February 1, a spokesman 
said Monday [31 January], saying that Zaire had been declared 
"insolvent." The decision will mean the cancellation of all 
outstanding credit lines. 
  The official said the French West African country's debt 
with 
the bank now stood at 45 million dollars. Financing had 
initially been suspended last July, when an envelope of the 
order of 170 million dollars was still available. The World 
Bank is involved in financing various projects in Zaire, notably 
in the sector of infrastructure and water-purifying. The 
official said a liaison office would remain in Kinshasa under 
the auspices of the United Nations Development Programme.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Four members of Djibouti's illegal opposition 
coalition, the United Front of the Opposition, FUOD, have been 
arrested. When multiparty politics was introduced in 1992, only 
three parties were registered as legal, but there are a number 
of underground parties. The arrests seem to be linked with an 
appeal by the four at a meeting in Addis Ababa for the rebel war 
against the Hassan Gouled government to be intensified. FRUD 
[Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy], which is 
fighting the war, is a member of FUOD. With more details on the 
arrest, Christo Farar telexed this report from Djibouti: 
  The four men were arrested this morning under Article 108 of 
the Penal Code. The most prominent among them is the chairman 
of FUOD, Mohamed Ahmed Issa, nicknamed Cheikho. His arrested 
colleagues are Mahdi Ibrahim Goud, Kamil Ali Mohamad, and Galal 
Abdourahman Ahmed. The four had just returned from a meeting of 
the FUOD coalition in Addis Ababa on Wednesday [26 January], 
attended by all its members including the Front for the 
Restoration of Unity and Democracy, FRUD, which is fighting a 
rebel war against the Hassan Gouled government. At the meeting, 
the men appealed for the continuation and intensification of the 
armed struggle throughout Djibouti territory in order to, as 
they put it, overthrow the dictatorship of Hassan Gouled. 
Delegates responded by signing a declaration threatening to 
oust the government. 
  According to a statement on Radio Djibouti, the FUOD 
chairman 
and his aides were arrested because their comments amounted to 
an incitement to the continuation of the war. According to a 
FUOD communique, lawyers and relatives of the detainees have 
been denied access to the men who are being held by the 
paramilitary forces of the Gendarmerie Nationale. It is 
expected they will be brought to the public prosecutor's office 
tomorrow. President Hassan Gouled Aptidon is currently on a 
private visit to France.

  [Text] The mainly Afar FRUD [Front for the Restoration of 
Unity and Democracy] rebels in Djibouti might have taken a 
beating in last year's big government offensive, but it seems 
the fighting is not over. The rebels are pinned down in the 
northern Tadjoura area, where they claim to be giving the 
government a lot of problems by launching hit-and-run raids on a 
wide range of targets including military convoys, and there are 
reports of a sizable clash in the region on Wednesday [26 
January] this week. Raggi Omar asked FRUD's Europe 
representative in Paris, Ismael Ahmed, what information he had 
about this week's fighting. 
  [Begin recording] [Ahmed] Yes, we have made lots of action 
in 
the Tadjoura and Obock area against governmental positions and 
against even convoys, and the FRUD fighters had success in all 
those actions. 
  [Omar] And how many convoys have you hit, and what kind of 
convoys were they? 
  [Ahmed] They were military convoys. We had a lot of them, 
approximately 16 or 17 in this month and a lot of positions of 
government. 
  [Omar] Is this fighting still going on? 
  [Ahmed] It is, yes. In some areas, it is still going on, 
but we are moving guerrillas, and we cannot say when and how we 
will wage future actions. 
  [Omar] So let me get this straight. Your military tactic is 
to effectively make large parts of northern Djibouti 
ungovernable by the Djiboutian forces that are there. 
  [Ahmed] No, our objective is to withdraw the Gouled 
government. We are convinced that the fundamental problem of 
Djibouti cannot get a solution other than a political solution, 
so we are doing everything in our possibility to withdraw that 
government. 
  [Omar] It sounds like--from what you are saying--FRUD has 
been pinned down in that northern Tadjoura area and that all you 
are able to do effectively is to launch these hit-and-run 
attacks and that there is not much more than you can do apart 
from that. 
  [Ahmed] No, because we have done other actions. We have 
liberated, you know, at the beginning of the armed struggle, 
two-thirds of the territory, but we have faced a lot of 
logistical problems because we are not the state and we are not 
helped by another state. So now, we are doing--with our own 
means--the armed struggle, and we have adapted ourselves 
according to our means. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Nairobi, Jan 30 (AFP)--Somali warlord Mohamed 
Farah Aidid returned to the Kenyan capital Sunday [30 January] 
after a four-day visit to Uganda, during which he had talks with 
President Yoweri Museveni, officials said. 
  Aidid will stay in Nairobi for "a few more days" to continue 
consultations with other factions about the possible formation 
of an interim government in Somalia before the end of March, 
Aidid's spokesman Mohamed Hassan Awale said. [passage omitted] 
  He emphasized that the provisional administration would only 
be set up after a consensus had been reached with other 
factions. Aidid's Somali National Alliance (SNA) faction will 
not impose a government in Somalia, he added. [passage omitted] 
  Aidid is expected to meet representatives from the Somali 
Salvation Democratic Front, the Somalia National Democratic 
Union and the Somali National Front later this week before 
returning to Mogadishu. General Aidid has repeatedly called for 
UNOSOM's departure accusing the force of killing thousands of 
Somalis. [passage omitted] 
  Aidid travelled to Uganda from Nairobi on Thursday. 
  He arrived in Kenya late last month after the collapse of 
United Nations-sponsored peace negotiations in Addis Ababa.

  [Text] Two people have been shot dead in Iganga by police 
who were trying to disperse hundreds of rioting taxpayers who 
attempted to demolish a police post in Iganga District. 
  The victims were shot as they tried to disarm the police, 
who 
were firing in the air to scare away the mob. According to the 
police commander in Iganga, over 800 stick-wielding and 
stone-throwing taxpayers converged on Nambale Police post to 
demolish it and get hold of the subcounty chief of Nambale, whom 
they thought had taken refuge there. They accused him the chief 
of overassessing them. 
  Meanwhile 77 rioters who were arrested from the subcounties 
of Nabitende, Nambale and (Namungabe) have appeared in the 
court, charged with inciting people against payment of tax. 
Twenty of them pleaded guilty and were sentenced to 12 months 
imprisonment. Those who denied the charge were remanded. 
  Agitation against payment of the graduated tax started last 
Monday [24 January] in Nabitende Subcounty and later spread to 
Nambale, (Namungabe), and later to (Ivukwa) and Bulange in 
Busika County, also Bukoma in Luka County and (Namulemba) in 
Bugweri County.

  [Text] The chairman of the United Somali Congress [USC], 
Mohamed Farah Aidid, met yesterday Ugandan President Yoweri 
Museveni at the presidency in Kampala. Aidid briefed President 
Yoweri Museveni on the actual situation in Somalia. He also 
spoke on the reasons for the failure of the Addis Ababa meeting 
of Somali groups. 
  Similarly, Mohamed Farah Aidid briefed President Museveni on 
the meetings he had held with Somali groups in Nairobi in which 
President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya and his government took an 
unforgettable [as heard] role in suggesting ways to end 
differences between the Somali groups. Aidid expressed deep 
gratitude to President Moi, who made it possible for him and the 
alliance to meet with the Somali groups and Somali nationals 
living in Kenya. 
  The chairman of the Somali National Alliance [SNA] also 
thanked President Museveni for his efforts toward reconciling 
the Somali people so that they could rebuild their country. 
  Yoweri Museveni also spoke at the meeting and said there was 
a need for the Somali people to reconcile themselves, regain 
their dignity, and work toward forming a national government 
before international troops left the country. Museveni 
commended the chairman of the SNA for his efforts toward 
resolving the problem in Somalia. The chairman of the SNA and 
the USC also met with Somali nationals living in Uganda and 
briefed them on the situation in Somalia, particularly on the 
hardships inflicted on the Somali people by (?international) 
troops. He called on the Somali nationals he met in Kampala to 
unite and work toward cooperation and the revival of Somali 
brotherhood.

  [Text] Kampala, Jan 30 (AFP) -- The Somali faction headed 
by warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid said Sunday [30 January] it 
planned to set up an interim government in Somalia before the 
end of March, in a veiled ultimatum to the UN peacekeeping force 
there to leave. 
  Spokesman for Aidid's Somali National Alliance (SNA) Mohamed 
Hassan Awale who accompanied the faction leader to Uganda said 
the United Nations peacekeeping force in Somalia (UNOSOM) had 
outlived its usefulness in the war torn-country now that famine 
had ended. 
  "After the creation of an authority in (the capital) 
Mogadishu and our target is March, disarmament will start and if 
we need help we shall ask African leaders to provide a 
peacekeeping force," said Awale, Aidid advisor on international 
affairs. 
  Aidid left the Ugandan capital Sunday after a four-day visit 
during which he had talks with President Yoweri Museveni. 
  The warlord has repeatedly called for UN Operation Somalia's 
[UNOSOM] departure accusing the force of killing thousands of 
Somalis. 
  The United States has set March 31 as the deadline for the 
pullout of its troops from Somalia, but the UN plans to maintain 
an 16,000-strong international force in the country. 
  UNOSOM went to Somalia last year originally to keep the 
peace 
while aid workers distributed food to hundreds of thousands of 
starving people but the force was later locked in bloody clashes 
with SNA militiamen after the UN accused Aidid of ordering the 
killing of its soldiers and ordered his arrest. 
  Awale said Aidid had "fruitful discussions with President 
Museveni on the situation in Somalia and the progress towards 
peace amongst the fighting factions". The meeting took place on 
Saturday. 
  Aidid is going back to the Kenyan capital, Nairobi to 
continue peace negotiations with other Somalia factions, Awale 
said. 
  He is expected to meet representatives from the Somali 
Salvation Democratic Front, the Somalia National Democratic 
Union and the Somali National Front, before returning to 
Mogadishu within the next couple of days, Awale said. 
  Aidid travelled to Uganda from Nairobi on Thursday. He had 
been in Kenya since UN-sponsored peace negotiations in Addis 
Ababa collapsed.

  [Text] Kampala, Jan 28 (AFP)--Uganda's President Yoweri 
Museveni said on Friday [28 January] he had ordered the arrest 
and deportation of two Burundi Army officers implicated in the 
October coup attempt in the central African country. Museveni 
told a news conference that although Uganda did not have an 
extradition treaty with Burundi, the two soldiers will not be 
allowed to stay in Uganda. "I have instructed our people to 
arrest the officers and expel them from Uganda although we shall 
not take them back to Burundi," Museveni said. 
  Museveni did not name the soldiers, but last month Burundi 
was reported to have asked Uganda to extradite Major Lazaro 
Busokoza and Lieutenant Paul Kamana who fled to Uganda after the 
October 21 coup attempt. 
  President Melchior Ndadaye was killed when the army, 
dominated by the minority Tutsi tribe, tried to overthrow his 
popularly elected government. 
  Ndadaye was from the majority Hutu group and winner of the 
small highland nation's first multi-party presidential poll. 
  Meanwhile, Museveni and visiting Eritrean President Isayas 
Afewerki signed an agreement for economic and cultural 
cooperation between the two countries. Isayas is scheduled to 
leave Uganda later Friday after a five-day official tour.

  [Text] THE GHANAIAN DEMOCRAT and THE INDEPENDENT comment 
on relations between Ghana and Togo. THE DEMOCRAT recounts 
atrocities meted out Ghanaians living in Nigeria, Cote d'Ivoire 
and, recently, Togo, and says in addition to killing Ghanaians, 
the Togolese have, for the first time, violated Ghana's 
territorial integrity. THE DEMOCRAT therefore calls on the 
government not to continue toeing what it calls the soft line in 
the face of the savage acts perpetrated against Ghanaians in 
Togo. It hopes this is the last time lives of Ghanaians would 
have been wantonly lost. 
  On its part, THE INDEPENDENT says it believes that Ghanaians 
do no want to go to war with Togo. An internationally arranged 
meeting between Presidents Rawlings and Eyadema on a neutral 
ground could therefore bring about peaceful coexistence.

  [Text] Guinean men and women, by the grace of God, on 19 
December 1993 you elected me through the ballot box to continue 
to lead our country. I thank you for the confidence that you 
have renewed in me, not only because of my victory, but 
especially for the political maturity that you have displayed 
through your massive participation in this first multiparty 
election and your calmness and tranquillity during the 
elections. This good example was well noted by the impartial 
observers. This is again to the credit of the Guinean people. 
I sincerely thank the entire Guinean people for this. I extend 
my sincere gratitude particularly to all those who contributed 
to the smooth organization of the elections. I particularly 
have in mind activists and supporters of the Party for Unity and 
Progress [PUD], the party which chose me as its humble 
presidential candidate, as well as activists and supporters of 
other parties and associations that supported my candidacy. 
Finally my gratitude goes to all anonymous persons who do not 
belong to any political parties or associations but who placed 
their confidence in me. 
  Dear compatriots, in this regard I do not want to represent 
a 
particular family, ethnic group, or region. I want to be the 
humble servant of all Guineans wherever they are and whatever 
their social category. I want all Guineans to know that I will 
never consider the unfavorable votes of some compatriots as the 
expression of hostility against my person. On the contrary, I 
consider the expression of difference an indispensable element 
for strengthening democracy which I have resolutely introduced 
into our country. I wish that this viewpoint as well as the 
determination to build national unity through work and education 
will be shared by all the actors in the political life of our 
country. Never will I consider my seven competitors as my 
enemies but as indispensable actors in the democratic process. 
  During my mandate, I will devote most of my energies and 
experience to the service of Guineans and our fatherland Guinea. 
In this task of nation building which we will accomplish 
together, I will need the ideas, competence, and know-how of 
each and everyone of you. This is why I am making a solemn 
appeal to all persons of goodwill, regardless of their political 
leanings, to join in building Guinea, for in my view, the 
victory of the PUD candidate is not the victory of one fraction 
of Guineans against another. It is the victory of all Guinean 
people over their agonies and over all the insidious forms of 
social disintegration. 
  It is now up to all cadres to be responsible for 
safeguarding the presitge of our nation and the existence of the 
state by showing our people the highest degree of tolerance. 
Tolerance, which was the motto of my electoral campaign, is for 
me the most beautiful and the highest of all virtues. Nothing 
is possible in society without this human quality. It is a 
precondition for all relationships between men. Those who 
describe tolerance as a sign of weakness should know that 
tolerance does not leave out any ideal. It is a virtue whose 
force resides in the respect of others. 
  Dear compatriots, one condition that will enable us to 
confidently begin this new page in the history of our country is 
for all political leaders to come together and together set up a 
solid foundation for a democratic society. For my part, and 
within the framework of the already defined conditions, I am 
open to dialogue, consultations, and cooperation with all 
Guineans of goodwill, regardless of their political leanings. 
  Dear compatriots, the important changes that we undertook in 
all fields, should be pursued with more rigor and cohesion so as 
to confer more efficiency to our action. As I have said on 
several occasions, during my term of office, I will strive to 
pursue -- with your help -- the social program that was 
initiated in 1984 and that I proposed to concretize in December 
1985. Of course, I will continue to proceed with the necessary 
assessments in order to readjust it and make the necessary 
changes. Therefore, priority sectors remain the same such as 
the strengthening of national unity to ensure the prevalence of 
peace in our country, the consolidation of a law-abiding state, 
and the respect of republican institutions. 
  Dear compatriots, I am well aware of the importance of the 
tasks ahead, some of which deserve special attention. The war 
against delinquency and insecurity will be resolutely and firmly 
waged. We should know that this fight is the duty of each and 
every one of us. Families, schools, communes, and prefectures 
should play their role as educationists. All in all, the state 
will assume its responsibilities to maintain public order and to 
ensure the security of citizens. 
  Fellow Guineans, the fact that the international economic 
circumstances are becoming more and more difficult has also led 
our country to be confronted with the painful problem of 
unemployment. At that level, the struggle to create a maximum of 
jobs requires the involvement of all our financial backers. We 
should facilitate their participation in order to achieve these 
objectives. To do so, we have to take global measures capable 
of making it easier for them to revamp the private sector and 
thus generate new jobs. 
  In this framework, there is the need to be adapted to the 
labor market. Young graduates in search of jobs will have to 
benefit from the preferential recruitment quota on the basis of 
qualification criteria required by the employer. 
  Our equipment and territorial development policy will 
particularly stress the solution of energy problems and the 
development of communication infrastructure in order to make the 
remote areas accessible. We must never forget that our 
prosperity depends mainly on the farmer. Helping the farmer to 
efficiently formulate factors of production and continuing to 
protect him from arbitrary fixing of prices of his produce are 
some of my main concerns. He must be encouraged in his fight to 
make our country self-sufficient in food production. 
  These objectives cannot be attained without ensuring moral 
probity in the management of public affairs. I will personally 
watch over this. In order to implement this program, I place my 
great hope in women and young people, the active forces of the 
society. This is an occasion to salute the important role 
played by women and young people in all our achievements so far. 
I would like to remind them that we are looking forward to 
their contribution. It will be decisive in the successful 
implementation of the socioeconomic program that we have 
assigned ourselves. 
  People of Guinea, in addition to the great efforts that we 
have to make in developing our country, we need the support of 
our traditional partners and the international community. We 
thank them for the assistance they have given us in the 
implementation of our democratization process. 
  Fellow Guineans, your trust gives me a new force that I am 
determined to put to the service of our dear fatherland. All we 
need now is to accept our differences and reach a national 
consensus on the strategies and stakes for the country's 
economic development. In this connection, we must learn to 
resolve our problems ourselves without being discourteous. This 
means we must get down to work. Our ambition to be a strong, 
united, and prosperous nation calls for this attitude. 
  Long live democracy. Long live the Republic.

  [Text] While the peace process in Liberia remains bogged 
down, fighting keeps on breaking out in various parts of the 
country. The latest is in Bong County between Charles Taylor's 
NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] and yet another 
anti-Taylor armed group. Once again it seems the civilian 
population are getting the worst of it. From Monrovia, 
Niinartey Allison telexed this report: 
  Hundreds of panic-stricken people are fleeing from the 
renewed fighting in Lower Bong County. They are moving south 
toward Kakata and Harbel. A broadcast on NPFL-controlled radio 
on Sunday [23 January] confirmed the fighting. Another 
broadcast this morning by Charles Taylor called on ECOMOG 
[Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring 
Group] to immediately deploy troops in the area. Relief 
officials here said today that about 9,000 people have fled the 
fighting around (Killer Bay) and Sonoya. Some residents of 
Sonoya, who arrived in Harbel at the weekend, said the fighting 
is still continuing. They said the fighting was between the 
NPFL and the new armed group called the Bong Resistance Movement. 
  They explained that a good number of people are fleeing 
areas 
around the Salala Rubber Plantations, Jibi, German Camp, and 
Bolola. One eyewitness, Martha Togber, explained how she was 
forced to leave behind her 80-year-old mother as the sound of 
gunfire came closer to her house. 
  Meanwhile, Alhaji Koromah's ULIMO [United Liberation 
Movement 
for Democracy in Liberian] movement has imposed a dusk-to-dawn 
curfew on Kakata, 35 miles north of Monrovia, as a result of the 
refugee influx there.

  [Text] No sooner had we broadcast that report [on the 
fighting] in our earlier edition than NPFL [National Patriotic 
Front of Liberia] spokesman Joe Mulbah called us up to dispute 
it, and Robin White asked him what they had to say: 
  [Begin recording] [Mulbah] Indeed, we are shocked by the 
news report from your stringer, Niinartey Allison. I mean, it 
is absolutely false. We just called (Killer Bay). Our 
commanders are all there. In fact, they are jubilating today -- 
it is our leader's birthday -- so they are shocked by the news. 
It is not true, but what emanated from Monrovia is that some 
disgruntled elements who happened to have once lived in Bong 
County are getting together. They want to attack us. As you 
know, various forces in Liberia have tried to fight us. They 
consider us as an elephant; everybody is trying to get a piece 
of the elephant. They have all tried their best, but to no 
avail. 
  [White] But has this Bong Movement attacked your forces at 
all? 
  [Mulbah] They have never attacked us. This is.... [pauses] 
I mean, it is indeed a shock. As I told you, we do not know 
where Niinartey got his story from, but you can have a dinner 
party in (Killer Bay). You can equally have a big party in 
Salala. The Salala area is under complete control. I just saw 
General Vanney, Gen. Gueye, and Gen. Siafa Nomadia all in 
control of those areas that your reporter was referring to this 
afternoon. Things are well, and this can indeed be attested to 
by the UNOMIL [UN Observer Mission in Liberia] people we have in 
our area who have been deployed. 
  [White] But why are people then fleeing? 
  [Mulbah] People are not fleeing. This is why I say we are 
shocked. We don't know where you got your story from.... 
  [White, interrupting] This is relief officials.... 
  [Mulbah, interrupting] Probably, your.... 
  [White, interrupting] This is relief officials. They are 
saying that thousands of people have fled the fighting. 
  [Mulbah] It is not true. We are not fighting, and I think 
you need to send Niinartey Allison here. We are prepared to 
take him at the places he referred to to confirm the story. 
  [White] But hasn't Charles Taylor himself requested ECOMOG 
to send some troops to the area immediately to bring things 
under control? 
  [Mulbah] We have asked for troops to be deployed in our 
areas as per the Cotonou Accord. This is what was said on our 
radio. 
  [White] So, it is not a special request to go and fight 
these Bong people? 
  [Mulbah] No, it is not a special request. I think we are 
capable. We are in a position to defend ourselves, but we are 
not ready to do anything otherwise but to abide by the Cotonou 
Peace Accord. [end recording]

  [Text] The interim government says it will not tolerate any 
attempt to stir political division or sow seeds of ethnic 
discord in war-torn Liberia due to the selfish acts of 
ethnically bound political aspirants. The government issued a 
stern warning to all those who may want to cause ethnic and 
tribal problems that the government, in the interest of peace 
and the resolution of our devastating conflict, will spare no 
legal measures in preventing any such individuals from 
sabotaging the concrete steps being made towards peace. 
  The government said it would take action against any narrow 
ethnic trend that would prefer to put tribal ambition over and 
above the national interest, especially when that ambition is 
not supported by the totality of the Liberian people. 
  The government was reacting to newspaper reports of a 
statement said to have been filed by Mr. Melvin Nguaya and 
approved by Mr. Joseph Kononia, alleging to have been issued on 
behalf of Bong County citizens. The interim government noted 
that the statement issued threats and [word indistinct] to whip 
up ethnic-based frenzy in the safe haven that has been created 
by ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire 
Monitoring Group]. 
  Government noted that the statement has no motive but to 
create ethnic divisions among Liberians, especially at a time 
when every effort is being made by the interim government, 
ECOWAS [Economic Community of West African States], and the 
international community to bring to a close the war in which the 
ethnic factor has been so prominent. 
  A press statement issued yesterday said the interim 
government is indeed disappointed because at a time when ECOMOG 
has successfully created a safe haven in Monrovia and its 
environs and one which reflects the largest ethnic diversity 
ever, Mr. Kononia and official of government, and his 
collaborators will choose to use that same safe haven to fall 
back on base ethnic sentiments to promote a political 
personality. 
  The interim government says it would prefer that Mr. Kononia 
and Mr. Nguaya use the safehaven -- that is Monrovia and 
environs -- more constructively to advance the cause of peace 
instead of pursuing narrow political goals based solely on 
ethnic division. Mr. Kononia and his like, the statement said, 
seem to have forgotten that Mr. Kuyon was elected by the interim 
government not because he is a Tele man and that one of his 
accomplishments made under the promotion of the IGNU [Interim 
Government of National Unity] was based on the fact he was Tele. 
  The interim government believes that if individuals like Mr. 
Kononia and Mr. Nguaya are truly committed to the promotion of 
the political fortunes of Mr. Kuyon, they will do well to 
organize a political campaign at the appropriate time to promote 
Mr. Kuyon's candidacy for any elected high office in this 
country rather than make an ethnically based claim on a position 
to which the interim government had earlier appointed Mr. Kuyon 
in the first place. 
  The release said they should also be reminded that the IGNU 
is currently actively preoccupied with working closely with 
ECOWAS and the international community to bring to an end such 
ethnic dissensions that are being manifested in the formation of 
the so-called Lofa Defense Force and now the Bong Resistance 
Movement. The government wishes to emphasize that no one should 
mistake its resolve to protect the with all the resources at its 
disposal the safe haven that has been created for our war-weary 
people in Monrovia and its environs. 
  Meanwhile, the interim government has called on Mr. Kuyon to 
demonstrate his avowed statesmanship and love of country by 
ensuring that no ethnic-based organization uses his name or 
otherwise put him in complicity in an effort to sabotage the 
peace process and the national good. The statement concluded by 
saying that there is no more room in this country for tribally 
based politicians.

  [Excerpts] The president of the Republic today signed a 
decree closing the National Assembly extraordinary session, 
convened on 24 January. During this first extraordinary session 
which ended this afternoon, the National Assembly adopted an 
enabling law permitting the government to legislate on prices, 
salaries, and fiscal issues for a period of three months. The 
government had earlier requested the adoption of this law 
following the devaluation of CFA franc at the beginning of this 
month. The National Assembly at the end of the session adopted 
the following resolution: 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording] The National Assembly 
calls for the following: acceleration of the implementation of 
measures on the freeze and control prices adopted by the 
government to neutralize the (?increases) and contain inflation; 
elaboration and implementation of backup measures likely to 
diminish the negative effects of the devaluation, notably the 
social cost of the adjustment; implementation of an effective 
policy to protect our local industries and to promote local 
production; measures to integrate the economies of West African 
Economic Community member states to finally create a common 
currency; the assumption by the Central Bank of West Africa, the 
World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and eventually by the 
Bank of France and the French Government, of foreign debt 
surplus incurred by Niger businessmen as a result of the 
devaluation of the CFA franc. 
  Article 2: The National Assembly enjoins the government to 
render account to it within a period of three months, effective 
the date of the adoption of the present resolution, on the 
concrete implementation of the provisions and guidelines that 
have thus been defined. [end recording] 
  The National Assembly also adopted a resolution on 
discrimination within the administration. Here is an excerpt of 
this: 
  [Begin recording] First, in line with constitutional 
provisions, the National Assembly condemns all kinds of 
exclusions from any quarters. Second, the National Assembly 
approves government decision to cancel the recent competitive 
examination of the customs and [words indistinct] and asks the 
government to take the necessary administrative and penal 
sanctions against those guilty of malpractices. [passage 
omitted] Fourth, the National Assembly appeals to the entire 
nation to ensure that the establishment and consolidation of 
national unity become the joint task of all Niger nationals. 
[end recording] 
  The third resolution adopted by the National Assembly 
concerned the schools and university situation. I bring you an 
excerpt of this resolution: 
  [Begin recording] Parliament welcomes efforts made by the 
authorities to pay scholarships, school allowances, the 
reopening of the Saye Islamic University, and the establishment 
of a mediation committee on the schools and university crisis; 
it welcomes the resumption of classes at the Abdou Moumouni 
University of Niamey and throughout the entire national 
territory; condemns the use of violence in the search for 
solutions for academic and university problems; deplores the 
living and working conditions of students in general, and in 
particular, of those residing outside the country; recommends to 
the government to place high premium on dialogue and 
consultations in the resolution of social conflicts, ensure the 
respect and implementation of current laws, propose to the 
National Assembly a bill on guidelines for education, and draw 
up the criteria to award scholarships in line with the ideals of 
equity and social justice; establish a rational program for the 
distribution and deployment of teaching staff and to promote 
more multi-grade classes in the rural areas. [passage omitted] 
It recommends to pupils and students to respect the laws, 
renounce the use of violence, and do all in their power to save 
the academic year and contribute to the rehabilitation of the 
Niger education system. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The head of state, General Sani Abacha, has 
announced that the fiscal and monetary policies in the 1994 
budget are not a repudiation of the policy of a deregulated 
economy. He said what the government has done is to finetune 
the structural adjustment program to meet the needs of society, 
particularly in the area of job creation, increasing capital 
utilization, and in food production. This was in a message he 
sent to the opening of the 16th Kaduna International Trade Fair. 
State House correspondent Mohammed Labo reports: 
  [Begin recording] The head of state's message was presented 
by the chief of general staff, Lieutenant General Oladipo Diya. 
Specifically, the head of state explained that the fixing of 
interest rates at between 12 and 15 percent, lending rate at 21 
percent, and the exchange rate of the naira at 22 naira to the 
dollar was the rational and patriotic decision to (?safeguard) 
genuine economic activity. [passage omitted] 
  He said the objective of the 1994 budget is the creation of 
a 
favorable climate for economic revival and a conducive 
atmosphere for investment, as well as increased capital 
utilization of the manufacturing sector. He appealed to the 
private sector to demonstrate a high sense of sincere commitment 
to the development of the country by responding appropriately to 
the policies. The head of state assured all investors of the 
security of their investment and specifically to the foreign 
investors the opportunity to repatriate returns on their 
investment. He also solicited the assistance of the private 
sector in monitoring the implementation of the budget which, he 
said, is a cooperative affair, and charged sector to shout aloud 
whenever there is a serious deviation on the part of the 
government or its agencies. 
  The minister of commerce and tourism, Chief Melford Okilo, 
unfolded a number of plans by his ministry to stimulate economic 
recovery and development. They include setting up of a 
Commodity Exchange Market, Comex, to give information on the 
availability of markets and prices of primary products, the 
promotion of nonoil exports, completion of the export processing 
zone in Calabar, and the establishment of a trade malpractices 
tribunal to handle cases of trade complaints which tarnish the 
image of the country. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] There was a meeting this afternoon at the Aflao 
border post between Togolese and Ghanaian officers. The 
Togolese delegation was led by Colonel Sei Memene, director of 
national security, while the Ghanaian side was led by Colonel 
Jasper Ahadzi, President Rawlings's special adviser for security 
affairs. Johnny Kojo Maxwell, Ghanaian charge d'affaires in 
Togo, also attended the meeting. It was the second time that 
the two delegations have met. The first meeting took place on 10 
January a few hours after the terrorist aggression against Lome. 
  Nothing filtered out of the meeting, which lasted 30 
minutes. 
Nevertheless, it is quite probable that the two parties are 
trying to ease the tension between the two countries. Relations 
between Ghana and Togo have seriously deteriorated since 5 
January when there was a commando attack on the Interarms 
Regiment camp where the Togolese head of state has his 
residence. Togo accused its western neighbor of serving as a 
base for the attackers.

<F P=106> [By Pierre Claassen] </F>
  [Text] Delmas, East Transvaal, Jan 29 SAPA -- State 
President F W de Klerk says the African National Congress's 
[ANC] manifesto, as far as he understood it, would not create 
the dynamic economy required to meet all the extravagant 
promises it contained. Rounding up his eastern Transvaal tour on 
Saturday with a media conference, he said he had only been given 
a sketchy framework by telephone of the newly released manifesto. 
  "As I understand it, one idea is that the ANC promises 
vastly 
increased government spending and reduced taxes. This is 
evidence of a typical manifesto drawn up by people with no 
experience in government or don't care what they promise." 
  He said the manifesto simply could not be implemented. By 
removing tax for those earning under R[rand]4,000 a month and 
exempting a large range of products from value added tax meant 
the tax burden would increase on those earning over R4,000 and 
companies, which would inhibit economic growth. 
  Although the NP [National Party] also stood for an ambitious 
programme to build houses and create jobs, this could only be 
done in an affordable way and required dynamic economic growth. 
The ANC proposal stifled any chances of economic growth, he 
said. 
  Mr De Klerk said he would study the manifesto further and he 
or his party would make further comments.

  [Text] Pretoria Jan 29 SAPA--The African National 
Congress's [ANC] election manifesto spelt disaster for South 
Africa and was a blueprint for a socialist state, the National 
Party [NP] said on Saturday. In a statement, NP Director of 
Information Marthinus van Schalkwyk said the ANC was totally 
unrealistic and made promises they would never fulfil. The 
massive state intervention proposed in, for instance, the field 
of housing was exactly the kind of thing that would destroy the 
economy and result in widespread unemployment and poverty, he 
said. 
  "The ANC has not learnt from the collapse of the socialist 
states in Africa and Eastern Europe," he said. Mr Van Schalkwyk 
warned that if the manifesto ever became policy, South Africans 
would pay much higher taxes.

  [Text] Rustenburg Jan 30 SAPA -- African National Congress 
[ANC] supporters in Bophuthatswana do not have to fear for their 
future because the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] was 
dealing with the problem. Answering questions from his audience 
at an ANC rally in Rustenburg on Sunday morning, Mr Mandela said 
the TEC knew ANC supporters in the homeland were being harassed 
and intimidated. 
  He said the TEC was addressing this problem and would take 
appropriate action, saying he realised Bophuthatswana President 
Lucas Mangope was persecuting the ANC. But he assured the crowd 
President Mangope would be powerless after the April 27 
elections. 
  "He is fighting a losing battle. The TEC is now the 
authoritative power in Bophuthatswana, and we are not without 
teeth," Mandela said. 
  The crowd when ecstatic when they thought the ANC leader 
said 
President Mangope did not have long to "live". Realising he had 
been misheard, Mr Mandela quickly clarified he had meant 
President Mangope did not have long to "lead" as president of 
the homeland. 
  Answering Bophuthatswana residents' fears of being harassed 
if found with a South African identity document, he pointed out 
voters could use their Bop [Bophuthatswana] ID documents. 
  Amplifying his leader, Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the 
Nation 
(MK); ANC military wing] chief Joe Modise said Bophuthatswana 
was completely dependent on the South Africa for its survival. 
However, if the situation did not improve, Mr Modise said they 
might have to move troops into the homeland the elections to 
allow political freedom. 
  Taking a dig at the National Party's campaigning tactics Mr 
Mandela said it would cost tax payers nearly R[Rand]500,000 if 
the NP had to pay people R10 each "for food and transport" to 
get a crowd. "If the national party offers you stew, potatoes 
and an orange to go to the rally, I say go. And then vote for 
the ANC," he said, smiling broadly. 
  He said the NP's electioneering tricks created hostility. 
Reacting to accusations from the NP that campaigners were being 
harassed by ANC supporters in the townships, Mr Mandela said ANC 
offices in five rightwing towns and the homes of two ANC 
officials had been bombed recently. The NP had not complained or 
taken any action to prevent more attacks, he said. 
  It was in the interest of all ANC supporters to allow the NP 
to campaign freely in the townships. "I appeal to you all. I 
don't want that party to say they lost the elections because 
they were not allowed to put their views across to everyone." 
  His American style of campaigning to meet the people and 
mingle with supporters nearly came to grief on Sunday. As crowds 
surged forward to shake Mr Mandela's hand at his car, a trapped 
reporter nearly had her legs crushed when the bodyguards in the 
car behind surged forward to close the gap. 
  She was forced to leap onto the bonnet of the car and spend 
a 
terrifying few moments while the bodyguards sped forward to try 
and get her off the car. Only cries from the crowd persuaded 
them to stop and allow her to be carried away. 
  A peace monitor was overheard commenting: "There is no 
proper 
control here today. The marshals are ineffective and this 
incident is a warning that someone could get seriously hurt soon 
if security measures are not beefed up". 
  A minute's silence was observed at the rally for former 
Cosatu [Congress of South African Trade Unions] president and 
mineworker, Elijah Barayi, who was buried in Carletonville on 
Sunday.

<F P=106> [Interview with African National Congress Chairman Nelson </F>
Mandela by Marcella Emiliani; place and date not given; "`I 
Shall Prevent Civil War' -- The Black Leader Appeals for 
Confidence in the New South Africa"; first paragraph is L'UNITA 
introduction] 
  [Text] "The toughest opposition to the transitional 
government currently comes from the Inkatha Freedom Party, which 
does not favor mediation." Nelson Mandela talks about the 
obstacles that the new South African democracy encounters in its 
path: the white extremists and the black ones. He promises to 
practice an "open-door policy" toward the international 
community, without "tyrannizing" investors. Pre-election 
opinion polls give the ANC 60 percent of the votes. 
  [Emiliani] Mr. Chairman, apartheid in South Africa is 
officially dead. The blacks have finally gained admission to 
the transitional government whose task is to organize the first 
free general election, to be held on 27 April. And yet the 
enemies of peace and democracy in the country seem to be 
multiplying. Who are the die-hards? 
  [Mandela] The toughest opposition to the transitional 
government currently comes from Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha 
Freedom Party and some of its fellow members of the Freedom 
Alliance. They sit at the negotiating table with us and do 
nothing but pursue an "all or nothing" tactic. Inkatha above 
all does not favor mediation, whereas the ANC -- the African 
National Congress -- has made mediation the rule so that as many 
sides as possible may be involved in the negotiations and the 
greatest number of political demands can be taken into account. 
Believe me, we are doing all we can to stop Inkatha and the 
other parties in the Freedom Alliance from walking out of the 
negotiations, now and again going far beyond the limits that we 
had set, just to keep the negotiations open. 
  [Emiliani] But the opposition in South Africa is now an 
armed opposition, and violence is spreading throughout the 
country. Which do you consider the more dangerous: the 
extremism of the whites, the hard-liners who want a return to 
apartheid, or that of the more radical black groups? 
  [Mandela] The African National Congress has never refused to 
talk to the right-wing groups, Inkatha and the Afrikaner 
People's Front included. As far as we have been able to 
establish, some of the leaders of the Afrikaner People's Front 
are inclined to be reasonable and are perfectly aware how 
dangerous it is to threaten civil war at the drop of a hat. Our 
discussions with them have been fruitful, and we are 
understanding one another better. Unfortunately, I cannot say 
the same of our talks with Inkatha. At times we come out of the 
negotiations with Buthelezi's party with the distinct feeling 
that we have made not the slightest step forward in mutual 
understanding. Nevertheless, we shall continue talking with 
Inkatha in the hope of persuading them to take part in the 
negotiating process again, and above all in the election on 27 
April. 
  [Emiliani] So what point have the transitional government's 
negotiations with the parties forming the Freedom Alliance 
reached? 
  [Mandela] As such, the transitional government, or rather 
the transitional executive council, is not negotiating with the 
Freedom Alliance. It is a structure conceived under the interim 
constitution to organize and monitor the election, an election 
that must be free and fair. The negotiations involve all the 
parties and organizations forming the transitional executive 
council, which have made some, albeit still inadequate, progress 
in the course of the negotiations. We are doing our best to 
speed things up, but there are limits beyond which we cannot go, 
issues on which we cannot compromise, such as the date of the 
election itself, which is set for 27 April. 
  [Emiliani] What is the ANC in particular doing in this 
connection? 
  [Mandela] The ANC's role in the negotiations is absolutely 
central. We are the guardians of the mediation process, and we 
are conducting it in the most all-inclusive manner, placing the 
interests of South Africa above any party interest. 
  [Emiliani] The more radical black groups, too, are raising 
difficulties and rejecting the negotiations. How are relations 
between the ANC and the Pan-African Congress at the moment? 
  [Mandela] We are both liberation movements. There are 
obviously differences between us, but we are working together as 
partners in the mediation process. We are pleased that the 
Pan-African Congress has decided to take part in the 27 April 
election. 
  [Emiliani] And what about relations between the ANC and 
AZAPO, the Azanian People's Organization? 
  [Mandela] Our relations with AZAPO, too, take account of 
the fact that we are both organizations working for the 
liberation of the oppressed black people of South Africa. 
However, we are different organizations, and the ANC is 
exterting strong pressure on AZAPO to fight the election. 
However, the fact that it has decided to boycott it does not 
detract from its being an organization working for liberation. 
  [Emiliani] According to the latest opinion polls, the ANC 
could win over 60 percent of the votes on 27 April. What is 
your economic program, what are your priorities once you are in 
government? 
  [Mandela] The opinion polls and the meetings that we are 
holding all over South Africa so that people can inform the ANC 
of their needs all point to the most sensitive issues being 
unemployment, the housing shortage, lack of education, and 
inadequate healthcare provision. As a people's liberation 
movement, in other words a movement that sets out to meet the 
people's needs, these are also the ANC's priorities. 
  [Emiliani] How have the business world and the international 
economic community, reacted to the transitional government? Are 
they showing confidence in South Africa? 
  [Mandela] I hope with all my heart that they start to 
believe in South Africa again. Since the ANC's appeal to the 
United Nations to repeal sanctions, the response has been 
favorable, and the Johannesburg stock exchange has recently 
shown a considerable increase in the volume of trade. Some 
major international companies are still put off by the spread of 
violence, but I am confident that as soon as we manage to create 
a true democracy and take measures capable of putting an end to 
the violence, we shall be able to create the conditions required 
to attract further investment. 
  [Emiliani] What sort of policy does the ANC intend to pursue 
toward foreign companies? 
  [Mandela] An open-door policy that avoids "tyrannizing" 
investors. What I mean is that we believe foreign investments 
must not be penalized by over-restrictive currency regulations 
and that the best way to attract them to South Africa is to give 
companies a wider range of investment opportunities. We should 
also like to see investment directed increasingly toward our 
country's emerging black business class, which apartheid has 
kept on the sidelines for a long time. 
  [Emiliani] One last question, Mr. Chairman. In your heart 
of hearts, to whom have you dedicated your Nobel peace prize, 
apart from the South African people? 
  [Mandela] You are right in saying that the courageous, long- 
suffering South African people, deserves the Nobel peace prize. 
Apart from South Africa, I believe that the president of the 
Palestine Liberation Organization, Yasser Arafat, and the 
Israeli prime minister, Yitzak Rabin, deserve it for the effort 
that they are making to bring peace to the Middle East.

  [Text] Stilfontein Jan 30 SAPA -- African National Congress 
[ANC] President Nelson Mandela appealed to militant rightwingers 
to participate in the April election and vote for an Afrikaner 
homeland. At the second stop of his western Transvaal campaign 
trail, the ANC leader told a crowd at Stilfontein that his 
organisation had made the Afrikaner's an offer they would be 
foolish to refuse. Rightwingers could have their own separate 
election ballot to vote for a volkstaat [homeland]. But, the 
ultimate decision on the establishment of such a homeland would 
be made by the government voted into power. 
  Mr Mandela further warned rightwingers not to do anything to 
plunge the country into a conflict that would leave many, both 
black and white, dead. "We know how to fight too," Mr Mandela 
said. 
  From one packed stadium to the next, Mandela kept up a 
hectic 
schedule on Sunday. Despite being a poor community, residents 
at the next stop at Jouberton Township outside Klerksdorp went 
all out to welcome him. Here, his message of proper housing and 
services, education, health care and employment for the masses 
drew an enthusiastic response. 
  Mr Mandela said no matter how much money and effort the ANC 
poured into uplifting poverty-stricken communities by creating 
jobs and giving children a free education, the people themselves 
had to work hard and be dedicated to improving their lot. He 
said the ANC's national public works programme would not only 
give people jobs, but allow the community to be part of a 
labour-intensive project of building facilities like homes, 
clinics, hospitals and roads. 
  Mr Mandela warned, however, that changes would not be 
noticeable in the first few years after elections. "Do not 
expect to be driving a Mercedes the day after the elections. 
You must have patience. You might have to wait five years for 
results to show. But, we will immediately begin mobilising 
resources and implementing plans," he said. 
  Throughout the day, Mandela appealed to people to allow the 
National Party to campaign freely in the townships. "We want 
you to give all organisations a chance to canvass support in the 
townships. Let them come and show they have nothing to offer 
you. They will only expose themselves. We will not have to 
bury them after elections. They are burying themselves," he 
said.

  [Text] Potchefstroom Jan 31 SAPA--African National Congress 
[ANC] leader Nelson Mandela said on Monday Afrikaners would not 
receive a separate election ballot, but his organisation would 
devise a means to gauge support for a volkstaat [Afrikaner 
homeland]. 
  On his campaign trail at the Boskop Agricultural Training 
Centre in Potchefstroom, Mr Mandela said his remarks on Sunday 
that Afrikaners could have a separate election ballot to vote 
for a volkstaat had not been accurate. "Afrikaners will not 
receive a separate ballot, but the ANC will devise a method 
through the election process where they will decide if the 
majority of Afrikaners want a volkstaat," he told the campaign 
rally. 
  On Sunday, Mr Mandela warned rightwingers not to do anything 
to plunge the country into a conflict. "We know how to fight 
too," he told a rally in Stilfontein.

<F P=106> [Report by David Breier] </F>
  [Text] Cape Town--Attitudes have hardened in the Afrikaner 
Volksfront (AVF) [Afrikaner National Front] after a deal with 
the ANC [African National Congress] and Government had appeared 
imminent this week. The deal on a possible volkstaat [homeland] 
was scuppered after it was watered down by the ANC's national 
executive committee (NEC). Yet more "final" talks are due on 
Monday. 
  AVF sources said they had shown the draft agreement to their 
most militant elements, including Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging 
[Afrikaner Resistance Movement] leader Eugene Terreblanche, Cape 
Conservative Party [CP] leader Jan Hoon and the [Orange] Free 
State CP executive, who all gave it their blessing. CP leader 
Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg also accepted it. 
  AVF moderates warned grimly late this week that the 
initiative was slipping from their hands as hardline elements 
threatened to make the running. One negotiator warned 
nervously: "There will be no elections if we don't take part." 
  It is understood that the AVF, the ANC and Government 
negotiators had earlier agreed on a draft amendment to the 
constitution reading: 
  "Provision shall be made in the constitution for the 
recognition of the right of self-determination of the peoples of 
South Africa. It shall be understood that the right to 
self-determination relates to the right of any of such peoples 
to determine their own destiny. Such right may be exercised in 
such a manner which does or does not entail a territorial 
entity." 
  However, the ANC's NEC watered down this agreement, and 
replaced it with: 
  "Nothing in these constitutional principles shall be 
construed as precluding recognition by the Constitutional 
Assembly of the AVF's idea of self-determination." 
  The AVF regards this amendment as "ANC tomfoolery" couched 
in 
sneering tones. 
  The ANC's latest proposals also tended to increase central 
government power instead of greater provincial powers as 
demanded by the Freedom Alliance [FA]. The ANC still rejects 
two ballots for national and provincial elections as the FA 
demands. 
  The IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], an FA member, is due to 
decide at a conference this weekend on whether it will take part 
in the election. But IFP organiser Senzo Mfayela said the 
conference might take a decision which was conditional on the 
outcome of Monday's negotiations.

  [Text] Pretoria Jan 29 SAPA -- Afrikaner Volksfront [AVF, 
Afrikaner National Front] leader General Constand Viljoen on 
Saturday said if the Afrikaner wanted a "volkstaat" [homeland] 
of his own before the April 27 election, he would have to take 
it by force, SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio 
news reports. Addressing a rightwing gathering in Pretoria, Gen 
Viljoen said such a decision, however, would have to be 
accompanied by the greatest degree of responsibility as it would 
have far-reaching implications for South Africa. 
  The assembly earlier adopted a resolution insisting on the 
Afrikaner's right to self-rule in his own territory and that all 
methods--including what was termed the "minimal use of 
violence"--should be pursued as a last resort to attain this 
ideal.

<F P=106> [By Norman Patterton] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria Jan 29 SAPA--The government and the African 
National Congress [ANC] should take cognisance of the angry mood 
of militant rightwingers who gathered in Pretoria demanding 
self-determination and a volkstaat [homeland], Afrikaner 
Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front, AVF] leader Ferdi 
Hartzenberg said on Saturday [29 January]. He was speaking at a 
news conference after a meeting of the AVF's own Transitional 
Assembly during which the audience clearly displayed their 
impatience for the creation of a volkstaat. 
  The orderly proceedings momentarily broke down when the 
assembly rejected resolutions proposed by Afrikaner Volksfront 
General Constand Viljoen, apparently because they were not 
militant enough and did not provide for the instant creation of 
a volkstaat. A suggestion by Gen Viljoen that conservative 
Afrikaners participate in the April elections to prove the AVF's 
support was dismissed with derision by a large section of the 
audience. 
  In the confusion Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner 
Resistance Movement] leader Eugene Terreblanche, who was not on 
the speakers programme, took the stage and said the Afrikaner 
could not live without freedom and if necessary would acquire it 
with the necessary violence. "Tell our leaders, give us an 
election, let the nation vote `yes,' but not at the ballot box 
for the ANC." The Afrikaner Volksfront was on the way to a new 
third, free Boer republic, Mr Terreblanche said. 
  Before the temporary breakdown in the programme, Gen Viljoen 
said the Afrikaner Volksfront could field tens of thousands of 
men at short notice if necessary, and also, eventually, hundreds 
of thousands if required. Politically, the Afrikaner was less 
powerful because it lacked numbers, but its salvation lay in its 
defensive capabilities, Gen Viljoen said. "Nothing but nothing 
can stop the Afrikaner from obtaining its freedom," he said. 
  Thousands of people packed the showground's hall where the 
assembly was held, while more gathered outside to follow the 
proceedings over loudspeakers. 
  Gen Viljoen said a constitutional threat was one of a number 
of dangers that faced the Afrikaner, and if the nation did not 
rise up to meet these challenges, it would lose its freedom 
without even knowing. 
  Candidates for the assembly sat in the front rows, their 
wives dressed and wearing hats as if for the annual opening of 
parliament. 
  It had become clear that the Kempton Park negotiations could 
not deliver the volkstaat by April 27, Gen Viljoen said. There 
was no simple solution to the complex problems of a volkstaat. 
"Today we'll have to decide: If we want a volkstaat before 
April 27 we would have to seize it violently..." 
  The crowd chanted "now, now". 
  Gen Viljoen continued: "I am thankful for that reaction 
because it shows you have resolution. The other option would be 
a strategic alternative to violence, and both involve risks." 
When he explained that a violent volkstaat cessession would 
have serious economic and security implications, and would 
probably lead to total anarchy, the crowd changed its stance and 
shouted, "no." Gen Viljoen added though that the violent option 
would be considered if the AVF was driven into such a position. 
  When he proposed that the Afrikaner volk [people] should 
vote 
for the AVF in April to prove its support among Afrikaners, the 
idea was raucously dismissed. Gen Viljoen said the possible 
borders of a volkstaat could also be determined in such a poll. 
  He proposed three resolutions: 
  -- That the Afrikaner won't accept the loss of freedom, and 
that the Afrikaner should demand the right to self-determination 
in an own area, and that the borders of such a region be 
determined; as well as the possible creation of cantons 
elsewhere in South Africa. 
  -- That the meeting authorises the Executive Council of AVF 
to realize Afrikaners' ideals by means of the most peaceful 
means possible. 
  -- That all methods, including a poll to determine whether 
to 
use minimum violence, be employed in order to secure a volkstaat. 
  But when it came to voting, the crowd became restless and 
the 
stage was swamped by people who surged forward, some groping for 
the microphone. 
  Another resolution from the floor was adopted, namely that 
any attempt to prevent the Afrikaner from ruling itself be 
rejected, and that the AVF be mandated to establish a 
Transitional Assembly. This assembly should function until free 
elections in the volkstaat could be held. This resolution 
seemed to cool tempers and the gathering elected Mr Frank le 
Roux as chairman of the Transitional Council and Dr Hartzenberg 
as president. 
  Addressing a news conference, Dr Hartzenberg said he 
believed the angry mood of the crowd would have a "positive" 
influence on Monday's tri-lateral talks between the Freedom 
Alliance, the government and African National Congress. The 
government and the ANC did not believe the AVF when it said the 
mood among Afrikaners was angry and impatient. Now they could 
judge for themselves, he added. The "bottom line" of Afrikaners 
was self-determination in an own volkstaat. 
  Dr Hartzenberg said the AVF would reveal later if they were 
going to take part in the general elections, but "these people 
are only prepared to vote on their own ballot paper for a 
volkstaat council", he said. Addressing the assembly, Dr 
Hartzenberg said the Afrikaner Volksfront's Transitional 
Assembly would try to establish a volkstaat through peaceful 
means, but would keep the violence option open. 
  Dr Hartzenberg said the Afrikaner nation wanted to vote in 
its own white election and wanted to elect its own government in 
its own country. There was no power in South Africa capable of 
suppressing the Afrikaner, he said. He predicted the failure of 
South Africa's interim constitution, claiming it represented 
only the interests of communists. Although the rightwing 
assembly would have no legal clout, its power lay in the 
authority the Afrikaner nation conferred on it. 
  Dr Hartzenberg said the assembly's task would be to mobilise 
the volk. One of its first tasks would be to establish citizens 
councils at local levels to obtain orders from the rightwing 
leadership and carry them out. 
  It would be irresponsible to pursue a volkstaat by violent 
means if it could be established through peaceful means, he 
said. "This nation has never been the aggressor and won't be 
now, but if our freedom is taken violently the Afrikaner volk 
would have the right to defend its freedom with all the means at 
its disposal." 
  If the Afrikaner was granted his freedom, he would become 
the 
best neighbour imaginable, but if his freedom was not granted, 
he would have to seize it by means of a "freedom programme", Dr 
Hartzenberg said. The AVF's executive council would also become 
the Transitional Assembly's executive council, he added. 
  Earlier in the day, a black journalist who wanted to cover 
the proceedings was escorted away by marshals. His colleagues 
charged that he had been jeered and called a "kaffir".

  [Text] The Conservative Party [CP] has warned that the 
constitutional negotiations between the government, the ANC 
[African National Congress], and the Freedom Alliance, are being 
threatened by serious obstacles and that the patience of the 
Afrikaner volk [people] has been exhausted. The CP negotiator, 
Mr. Fanie Jacobs, said the alliance would have nothing to do 
with the six-point proposal submitted by the ANC that placed new 
restrictions on exclusive powers for provinces. 
  Earlier, the deadline for negotiations was extended to 
Monday 
[31 January], and the date for the election was not promulgated 
today, as was originally planned. It's not known whether these 
developments will delay a decision by the Inkatha Freedom Party 
on its participation in the election. An announcement was to 
have been made after the party's conference at Ulundi this 
weekend. Similarly, it is not known whether right-wing 
Afrikaners will decide this weekend on their own transitional 
council.

  [Text] Ulundi Jan 30 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party 
[IFP] will not contest South Africa's first all-race elections 
in April under the present interim constitution but will 
continue seeking negotiated alternatives to the constitutional 
deadlock. A special IFP general conference in Ulundi on Sunday 
rejected the 1993 interim constitution but resolved to "pursue 
every last opportunity to seek agreement in negotiations", and 
mandated Inkatha's Central Committee to take a final decision on 
the April poll. 
  IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi told the conference on 
Sunday he had spoken earlier to State President F W de Klerk who 
had assured him he would do all he could to arrive at an all 
inclusive constitutional settlement. Mr Buthelezi had told the 
president he did not want to "shut the door" and that 
negotiations should continue and "take their course". 
  He told a media conference later, however, that it would 
take 
"almost a miracle" for an acceptable agreement within the next 
few days, echoing the views of one of his top negotiators, 
Walter Felgate, who described the latest ANC [African National 
Congress] proposals to break the constitutional impasse as an 
"insult to our intelligence". The IFP would continue last-ditch 
negotiations with the African National Congress and the 
government on Monday and had only 10 days to make a final 
decision on elections after Mr De Klerk had proclaimed the 
election date -- probably on Monday -- explained Mr Buthelezi. 
  Party negotiators Dr Ben Ngubane and Mr Joe Matthews flew to 
Pretoria on Sunday morning to prepare for the talks. 
  The IFP conference stood fast on the Freedom Alliance 
proposals to have the constitution amended and instructed 
Inkatha's Central Committee to receive a final report from its 
negotiators for review. It would also review achievements in 
negotiations on the Zulu monarchy. It further resolved to seek 
common cause with the Pan Africanist Congress on objection to a 
single ballot and would try to bring in the Democratic Party and 
others opposed to this system of voting. The IFP leader made it 
clear that this was one of the major stumbling blocks to his 
party's participation in elections. The IFP's other main 
constitutional demands include greater regional autonomy and the 
right for provinces to draw up their own constitutions and for 
these to be constitutionally entrenched. 
  Earlier, IFP negotiator Walter Felgate warned the deadline 
for a settlement was midnight on Monday but said there was still 
time for the African National Congress and the government to 
"come to their senses". Mr Felgate was a strong force behind an 
election boycott, charging on Saturday that negotiations would 
not deliver for the IFP. He also branded government chief 
negotiator Roelf Meyer a "liar". 
  Leading the anti-election stance was IFP President 
Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi who on Saturday told a few thousand delegates the 
interim constitution was "specifically designed to promote ANC 
power and was an instrument for the IFP's destruction". 
  Mr Buthelezi told the media conference on Sunday that his 
party had more to lose than any other by boycotting elections 
but laughed at predictions that the IFP would be relegated to 
the political wilderness by adopting this stance. The IFP 
leader said his party would resort to "resistance" politics but 
this would be non-violent. 
  Mr Buthelezi on Saturday, said he would not subject his 
supporters to a constitution which was "totally wrong for South 
Africa", adding while he had never rejected the notion of 
reconciliation with the ANC, "this constitution as it now stands 
is an arena for a struggle to the finish". 
  "Within its provisions there is no scope for constitutional 
or political settlements," he said.

  [Text] Ulundi Jan 29 SAPA--Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi has again rejected participation in 
South Africa's first all-race election under the current interim 
constitution and has warned of violent clashes between "the 
people" and a future African National Congress [ANC]-led 
government. In his opening address to a special general 
conference in Ulundi on Saturday, the IFP president said the 
current constitution should be opposed and called for "the 
courage to enter the politics of resistance". 
  "I say no to the present constitution and I say as this 
constitution stands, I do not see how we can enter elections." 
He said if the IFP capitulated and played the ANC/SA Communist 
Party political ball game, this would lead to future violent 
clashes between "the people" and an ANC government. 
  "This constitution as it now stands is an arena for struggle 
to the finish. Within its provisions, there is no scope for 
constitutional or political settlement." The IFP president said 
he was prepared to compete with any political leaders or party 
under a fair and just constitution. 
  He would not, however, subject IFP members to a constitution 
which was "totally wrong" for the country He rejected arguments 
that kwaZulu and the IFP would come to nought if they did not 
contest elections. "I say there can be no governance of 
kwaZulu/Natal without the active acceptance and participation of 
the IFP. 
  "This is a region where we dominate. No foreign forces shall 
come into it to rule over us." 
  The Inkatha leader again rejected the Transitional Executive 
Council, saying he would neither recognise nor obey it. 
  On the future of the Zulu monarchy, Mr Buthelezi said his 
position had to be constitutional entrenched, and anything less, 
"I am just not prepared to accept".

  [Text] Ulundi Jan 29 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party 
[IFP] is set to boycott South Africa's first all-race elections 
and enter "resistance" politics if delegates to a special 
conference in Ulundi stand by their leader, Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi's rejection of the poll under the current interim 
constitution. The IFP president on Saturday [29 January] told 
several thousand delegates gathered to finalise the party's 
stance on the April poll that the present constitutional deal 
would lead to a future "violent clash between the people and an 
African National Congress [ANC] government". 
  "I do not see how we can enter elections under the 
provisions 
of the interim constitution. I say we must oppose the 
constitution itself, as a matter of principle." 
  His remarks came despite last-ditch attempts by the ANC to 
reach a constitutional settlement with the Freedom Alliance, 
although Mr Buthelezi did not refer to or outline the latest ANC 
proposals. The IFP president called on his supporters to have 
"the courage to enter the politics of resistance", saying there 
could be no governance of kwaZulu/Natal without the active 
acceptance and participation of the IFP. "This is a region where 
we dominate. No foreign forces shall come into it to rule over 
us." 
  While he was not calling for violence or declaring war, Mr 
Buthelezi went on to say: "No government has ever won the kind 
of war against opposition which an ANC/SA Communist Party 
government will have to wage against us if we resist the present 
interim constitution." 
  Violent clashes between "the people" and a future ANC 
government were inevitable if the IFP capitulated, and played 
the ANC/SACP's political "ball game". 
  Mr Buthelezi said he would not stand by as an "abortion of a 
constitution dictates the final annihilation of the Zulu 
kingdom". He said he had never rejected the notion of 
reconciliation between the ANC and IFP, but the current interim 
constitution was an arena for a "struggle to the finish" and 
contained no scope for constitutional or political settlements. 
  "I am prepared to compete with any political leader and any 
political party under a fair and just constitution. I will not, 
however, subject you to a constitution which is totally wrong 
for South Africa." The current constitution was specifically 
designed to promote ANC power and was an instrument for the 
IFP's destruction, he charged, in his 16-page address. 
  Mr Buthelezi also repeated his rejection of the Transitional 
Executive Council [TEC], saying he would neither recognise nor 
obey it. 
  On the Zulu monarchy, he said King Goodwill Zwelithini's 
future could only be secured by entrenched constitutional 
provisions and "anything less than that will be an unwarranted 
taking of risks and a gamble I am just not prepared to accept". 
  In closing, the IFP president told delegates to "search your 
hearts" to decide whether he was wrong and whether he "should 
submit myself and yourselves to the interim constutition, and 
put you at the mercy of the TEC and other tranistional 
mechanisms". 
  "I want to stress that I will respect any consensus that 
comes out of this conference." 
  He also called for an end to "betraying" in the IFP Central 
Committee by members who had complained to the press that he was 
the "problem" in the party and that he was being led by Walter 
Felgate in rejecting the April poll. He was referring to recent 
remarks by senior IFP officials who have told the media they 
support the party's participation in elections and have 
criticised "hardliners" in the IFP for rejecting the poll. 
  While there is a strong pro-elections lobby in the party, 
particularly among newly recruited MPs, the mood at the opening 
of the conference appeared to be in line with Mr Buthelezi's 
rejection of the poll. Prominent IFP cleric Rev Sipho Mzimela in 
opening remarks called for delegates to "stand fast" and reject 
a "socialist dictatorship". 
  Delegates also spontaneously applauded speakers who 
reinforced Mr Buthelezi's views and who rejected a future anc 
government. 
  Mr Buthelezi's speech was followed by a closed door 
discussion of the pros and cons of contesting the April poll. A 
final IFP decision on the April poll is expected on Sunday 
afternoon.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Inkatha Freedom </F>
Party president, in Ulundi by South African Broadcasting 
Corporation announcer Freek Robinson in the Johannesburg studio, 
on the "Agenda" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Robinson] Can you just tell me what is the absolute 
minimum for you to settle tomorrow? 
  [Buthelezi] Well, the absolute minimum has been spelled out 
on the document that we presented to the ANC [African National 
Congress] and government on the 19 December, and that is 
concerning the provinces, concerning the powers of provinces, 
concerning the concurrents, concerning the fiscal powers, 
concerning the single and double ballot system. Those are, I 
think, the absolute minimum things that we would want to be put 
right. 
  [Robinson] We have been discussing those things in our 
studio 
tonight, but what is the most important for you, or are all of 
them as important and should a settlement be on all of those 
points together, tomorrow? 
  [Buthelezi] I think all those points are equally important, 
but I would say the single ballot and double ballot is a crucial 
thing. I would think that, in fact, it could really be the thing 
that will be decisive. 
  [Robinson] Dr. Buthelezi -- moving away from that -- if you 
go ahead with your decision not to take part in the election, 
will you nevertheless take part in the sense that you will 
dissuade people to vote? 
  [Buthelezi] Well, I know that the ANC and the government, in 
their collusion, have set traps for people who take action, in 
fact, to dissuade people from voting so that minefield I 
suppose.... [changes thought] I hope that I will not be forced 
to walk that minefield, because it is a minefield, but I think 
that the determination of the members of the IFP [Inkatha 
Freedom Party], as I saw it throughout the night last until the 
early hours of this morning, convince me that they are prepared 
to walk that minefield than sacrifice, you know, their 
principles for a massive (?portage). 
  [Robinson] Dr. Buthelezi, thank you very much for your 
participation tonight. Obviously we don't have the time now to 
have a long interview with you, but we'll try to create that 
opportunity as soon as possible. Thank you for your 
contribution. 
  [Buthelezi] Thank you, Mr. Robinson.

  [Text] Ulundi Jan 29 SAPA -- Inkatha negotiator Walter 
Felgate has poured cold water on the latest African National 
Congress [ANC] proposals aimed at breaking the constitutional 
deadlock with the Freedom Alliance. Addressing several thousand 
delegates at the Inkatha Freedom Party's [IFP] special general 
conference in Ulundi on Saturday [29 January], Mr Felgate said 
the latest proposals were "a total insult to our intelligence". 
  The proposals were tabled on Thursday and observers believed 
they may go some way to addressing the constitutional demands of 
the Freedom Alliance, which includes the IFP. They are due to 
come under discussion at extended bilateral talks in Pretoria on 
Monday. 
  But, Mr Felagate was emphatic: "Negotiations will deliver 
nothing to the IFP." He said while the latest ANC proposals 
went some way in addressing a few IFP demands, they, however, 
"put us in a worse position than we were the previous week". He 
did not elaborate. 
  Ongoing negotiations with the government and ANC would not 
deliver, said Mr Felgate, adding that should the IFP contest 
elections, it would do so on an unfair footing. He came out 
strongly aginst elections under the interim constitution and 
urged delegates to take a final decision on the IFP's stance on 
the April poll at the conference. 
  Earlier, while voicing his rejection of the April elections, 
IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi said the conference could 
also decide to mandate the IFP Central Committee to take a final 
decision later. Mr Felgate, however, said it would be a "fateful 
error if the conference doesn't come to a conclusion simply 
because there will be more 'bullshit' talked in Pretoria on 
Monday". 
  The IFP's position on the April poll is expected to become 
clearer on Sunday after debate during a closed session on 
Saturday afternoon.

  [Text] Ulundi Jan 30 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party 
[IFP] will not contest South Africa's first all-race election in 
April under the present interim constitution, IFP official 
Walter Felgate confirmed on Sunday [30 January]. An IFP special 
general conference in Ulundi at the weekend had, however, 
mandated IFP negotiators to continue trying to secure Inkatha's 
constitutional demands . 
  In an interview before closure of the conference on Sunday 
Mr 
Felgate said it was still "technically and politically possible 
for the government and the African National Congress to come to 
their senses". He was referring to IFP demands for greater 
regional autonomy, a double ballot system and other issues 
contained in a list of constitutional proposals put to the 
government and the anc by the Freedom Alliance last month. 
  But Mr Felgate cautioned the deadline for constitutional 
agreement was on midnight on Monday. He said the IFP would adopt 
a "multi-strategy approach", should it be forced to remain 
outside South Africa's transitional process, he did not 
elaborate, however. 
  Mr Felgate said the majority of delegates to the special 
general conference in Ulundi had strongly supported rejection of 
the April poll under the current interim constitution, adding 
that those in favour of the poll were likely to rally behind the 
decision by the majority of the party. 
  Official resolutions are expected later on Sunday.

PAC Deputy President Johnson Mlambo said on Monday [31 January]. 
Mr Mlambo was speaking in Transkei, where he was trying to 
defuse dissatisfaction of some PAC leaders and members over the 
announcement of the suspension of the organisation's armed 
struggle. SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio 
news quoted Mr Mlambo as saying the PAC's policy until now had 
been that the bullet would not be abandoned before the ballot 
was secured. Three PAC members, including Publicity and 
Information Secretary Waters Toboti, remain suspended after 
voicing disagreement over the suspension of the armed struggle.

  [Text] Cape Town Jan 30 SAPA -- Law and Order Minister 
Hernus Kriel seems set to be the National Party's [NP] candidate 
for the premiership of the Western Cape region after bagging the 
biggest support percentage at the weekend. This will set up Mr 
Kriel for a head-on clash in the election campaign against 
African National Congress [ANC] Western Cape premiership nominee 
Dr Allan Boesak. 
  It is understood that Mr Kriel's main "rival" for the post, 
Cape administrator Cobus Meiring, fared less well than his 
supporters expected. 
  The party's head council will meet on Monday to integrate 
and 
finalise the candidate lists but as one senior delegate said, it 
would "look very strange" if Mr Kriel did not get the nomination 
after the substantial support he received. Cape NP delegates met 
at various centres in the province on Saturday to elect 
candidates for the national and provincial election lists. 
  Mr Kriel gained the most support from altogether 1,300 
delegates from the rural and metropolitan areas -- meeting in 
Worcester and Stellenbosch respectively. There has been much 
speculation over recent weeks about the party's top candidate 
for the region. 
  Several months ago Mr Kriel announced he would be standing 
for the Western Cape regional parliament and indicated he would 
aiming for the top post. Cape administrator Cobus Meiring had 
also indicated his willingness to stand for the post. 
  It is understood that MECs [member of Executive Council] 
Peter Marais and Mrs Martha Olckers and MPs Gerald Morkel and 
Patrick McKenzie are also placed in the top 10 nominations for 
the provincial parliament. Cape NP leader Dr Dawie de Villiers 
is believed to have topped the list for national assembly 
candidates while finance spokesman Dr Francois Jacobsz, MEC Frik 
van Deventer, Deputy Trade and Industry Minister David Graaff 
and National Education Minister Piet Marais also are among the 
top 10. 
  All NP candidates lists are expected to be released early 
this week before the party's federal congress which starts on 
Tuesday at the World Trade Centre in Kempton Park.

  [Text] With less than three months to go before the April 
elections, the question is no longer which party will win an 
outright majority. Successive surveys indicate that the ANC 
[African National Congress] will win a two-thirds majority of 
the vote without any serious threat from its main rival, the 
National Party (NP). 
  Four opinion surveys conducted in recent months show ANC 
support ranging from about 55 percent to more than 70 percent. 
More recent surveys suggest that the organisation's support 
might even surpass the 70 percent mark. This is significantly 
up on the ANC's own estimates, when it said in March last year 
that it was assured of 53 percent of the vote. 
  More recently, the Institute for Multi-party Democracy 
(IMPD), in a survey done in association with the Human Sciences 
Research Council (HSRC) and MarkData, estimated support for the 
ANC/SACP [South African Communist Party] alliance at 70.3 
percent. This includes ANC support in the Transkei, 
Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei. 
  Surveys conducted by Markinor in May 1992 also show that 
support for the ANC among black voters is unparalleled. The 
survey found that only three percent of all potential black 
voters rejected the ANC "completely and on principle". During 
the same survey, 70 percent of blacks said they would 
"definitely vote for it (the ANC) if there were an election". 
Almost a year later, the same level of support is being 
reflected in surveys such the one conducted by the HSRC for the 
IMDP. 
  A Markinor survey found that when the total number of people 
who indicated their preference for the ANC as a first and second 
choice were combined, the movement walked away with a 76 percent 
majority. 
  Surveys have consistently shown the National Party (NP) as 
having the next highest supporting. Four surveys conducted in 
the past year, estimated NP support at anything between 15.5 and 
25 percent. Most recent figures put NP support at between 15.5 
percent and 16.1 percent. 
  It remains a largely white-based party, with only five 
percent of metropolitan blacks supporting it. While it enjoys 
considerable support in percentage terms from among the Indian 
and coloured communities, this does not translate into much in 
terms of the number of votes, given the relatively small size of 
these population groups. 
  Despite the NP's poor showing among blacks, only six percent 
said they "rejected it completely and on principle". Its 
overall performance among blacks, however, appeared to be 
deteriorating, with support at around 10 percent according to 
results of a Markinor poll released in November last year. This 
was five percent less than 12 months before. Support among 
whites also seemed to be on the slide. The number of voters who 
saw the NP as their first choice dropped from 67 percent in May 
1992 to only 43 percent a year later. 
  More unpopular than the NP among black voters is the Inkatha 
Freedom Party (IFP). According to the May 1992 Markinor survey, 
71 percent of blacks said they rejected the organisation. This 
made it even more unpopular among blacks than the Conservative 
Party (CP). This lack of popularity has been reflected in almost 
every other survey conducted so far. 
  The results of a Markinor survey released in November last 
year showed that only three percent of metropolitan blacks 
supported the IFP. The HSRC survey put its support slightly 
higher, at 3.3 percent, while one political analyst gave it 
between eight and 10 percent support -- its highest ever. 
  Inkatha has consistently rejected the opinion poll results 
and has argued that surveys did not reflect the extent of its 
support in Natal, where it claims it enjoys considerable 
support. But a Markinor survey in May 1993, conducted among 163 
black respondents in Durban, gave the IFP only 15 percent 
support, compared to the ANC's 50 percent. Interestingly, the 
IFP commands more support among whites in Durban than the ANC. 
While none of 100 whites polled supported ANC, 11 said they 
supported the IFP. 
  Support for the PAC [Pan Africanist Congress] among 
metropolitan blacks remained static since November 1992. Of all 
potential South African voters, the PAC enjoys the support of 
only 2.4 percent, according to the HSRC/IMPD survey. Another 
recent survey, whose results were published earlier this month, 
suggests that the PAC could count on the support of only 1.5 
percent. 
  The Democratic Party (DP) has put up an equally dismal 
showing in successive opinion polls. A SUNDAY TIMES/Markinor 
survey gave the DP less than three percent support. But the 
party has rejected the results and said it would aim to capture 
15 percent of votes. Recent surveys suggest it is far from 
achieving what clearly seems like an ambitious target. 
  It is against the background of this ambitious target, and 
the ANC's strong showing, that the DP and the NP have committed 
themselves to denying the liberation movement a two-thirds 
majority. The DP has been at the forefront of the crusade to 
block the ANC from winning more than 66.6 percent of the vote, 
with the NP boarding the bandwagon recently. 
  While the ratings of political parties serve as an important 
indicator of trends ahead of the elections, popularity ratings 
of individual political leaders cannot be ignored. This is 
especially important given that ballot papers will be marked 
with images of political leaders rather than symbols. 
  While it is difficult to gauge popularity trends in the case 
of ANC president Nelson Mandela, given the fact that few surveys 
go back further than 1992, a more comprehensive picture can 
easily be assembled of NP leaders. A survey to gauge opinion on 
how the state president was running the country found that in 
1978 only 22 percent of all blacks believed that the NP leaders 
was running the country "very well or fairly well." However, 
95 percent of all whites surveyed at the time found that the NP 
president was doing a good job of running the country. This 
support declined steadily during the next four years, dipping to 
78 percent among whites in 1982. Black respondents' opinion of 
the president improved during this same period. Whereas only 22 
percent of black respondents felt that the head of state was 
doing a reasonable job of administering the country's affairs in 
1978, the figure increased to 31 percent four years later. 
  Support for the National Party president took a dip in 1989 
following the resignation of P.W. Botha and the ascendancy in 
the party leadership of F.W. de Klerk. While De Klerk might 
have cost his party some white support because of reformist 
noises he made after his election as leader of the party in 
1989, he gained a considerable favour among black respondents. 
  Markinor figures show that De Klerk's approval ratings 
soared 
among blacks from a low of 22 percent in 1978 to 88 percent in 
May 1990 compared to 70 percent among whites. This was the year 
in which he unbanned the ANC. 
  However, by November 1992, the picture had changed markedly 
with De Klerk being regarded as doing a good job by only 47 
percent of all blacks surveyed compared to 69 percent of whites. 
In a matter of 12 months to May last year, the number of 
metropolitan blacks who felt that De Klerk was running the 
country fairly well dropped from 76 percent to 35 percent. This 
almost certainly has a direct bearing on the level of violence, 
which since 1990 has claimed thousands of lives in Reef 
townships. 
  Much of his support among whites came from English-speaking 
respondents. Markinor figures show that in November 1992, 75 
percent of English-speaking whites felt De Klerk was running the 
country very well or at least fairly well compared to 64 percent 
Afrikaans speaking whites. Marginal improvements in his 
approval ratings were recorded in May 1993, with 76 percent of 
English- speaking respondents approving of De Klerk compared to 
66 percent of Afrikaners. 
  Mandela, by comparison, was favoured as a leader by 78 
percent of metropolitan blacks, while only seven percent of 
whites said they would vote for him. In fact, Mandela increased 
his support among metropolitical blacks by five percent since 
November 1992. 
  Joe Slovo, chairperson of the SACP, showed the biggest gain, 
moving up from 13 to 27 percent among metropolitan blacks. This 
will certainly translate into significant voting support for the 
ANC, given the fact that Slovo features high up on the ANC's 
list of candidates for the National Assembly elections.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] The leader of the Venda, South African homeland, has 
a new job. Brigadier Gabriel Ramushwana is to become commander 
of the new South African National Peacekeeping Force. He was 
apparently a compromise candidate, and it could be a thankless 
job, with so many valuables to contend with in a South Africa in 
the midst of change. On the line to Venda, Jeremy Skeet asked 
Brigadier Ramushwana whether he was surprised to get the job. 
  [Begin recording] [Ramushwana] Oh yes, I was really 
surprised. That came from the blue really, I couldn't believe 
it. 
  [Skeet] How do you see your role in this position? 
  [Ramushwana] Well, I believe my role will be to, you know, 
create peace, to bring about peace within the South African 
region, and also to try, you know, to bridge differences that 
are there between political parties, followers, and so forth, 
and then also encourage the people to respect one another and to 
accept one another, as well as maintaining peace amongst 
themselves. 
  [Skeet] Do you think you are the right man for this? You did 
lead a bloodless coup to take control of Venda. Do you think 
you are the right man for this? 
  [Ramushwana] Well, maybe the people thought I was the right 
guy. For myself, I would say maybe I am. From the records, 
yes, in as far as this region is concerned, specially Venda as 
such, I took over in 1990, and I tried everything I could to 
bring the people together, to bring the warring factions 
together, and I also tried to do away with violence. 
Eventually, I succeeded. We are the most peaceful group of 
people within southern Africa today. 
  [Skeet] Now, one of the conditions when you become leader of 
this national peacekeeping force is that you have to give up 
your present job, which is ruler of Venda. Are you prepared to 
do this? 
  [Ramushwana] Oh yes, I am prepared to do this. Today I have 
been discussing with my Military Council regarding this issue, 
and we are almost about to finalize everything. I could step 
down by the end of the month, but I will still remain the chief 
of Venda Defense Force. We will be seconded to the South 
African Transitional Executive Council. 
  [Skeet] And will you transfer power to someone else, or will 
you just dissolve Venda? 
  [Ramushwana] No, no, no. What I will do is, seeing that the 
period is so short from now to the elections, I think it will be 
appropriate for me if I had to ask someone to take over from me 
and then continue up to after the elections. 
  [Skeet] Now, you are also on the ANC [African National 
Congress] list of potential candidates for the elections. Now, 
you taking this position means you will have to give up any 
political ambitions you have. 
  [Ramushwana] Yes, I have already, you know, resigned or, 
shall I say, asked them to remove my name from the list in order 
to be able to do my job properly. 
  [Skeet] So, after the elections, do you see your role within 
the new South African Defense Force? 
  [Ramushwana] Oh yes, the National Peacekeeping Force will 
obviously be part and parcel of the new South African Defense 
Force.

<F P=106> [Report by Piet Muller and De Wet Potgieter] </F>
  [Text] The General Staff of the South African Defense Force 
[SADF] this week warned State President F. W. de Klerk that the 
security situation in the country is extremely dangerous, and 
that right-wing groups in particular could launch large-scale 
violence or even an attempted coup at any moment. 
  They warned that if this happened, a considerable number of 
defense force officers and servicemen would possibly not remain 
loyal to the government, but would actively support the 
dissidents instead. Security sources indicated to RAPPORT a 
figure of "60 percent or even higher." 
  Regarding the loyalty of the SADF should they be called on 
to 
take action against the right wing, reference was made to 
General Constand Viljoen, who this week was quoted as saying on 
a radio program: "A government would have a tough time scraping 
together enough SADF members to take action against 
right-wingers." 
  The government apparently views the general staff's 
information in a serious light, and the details are being 
carefully studied. Defense force observers say the general staff 
would not confront the government with an "own agenda." They 
are simply presenting the state president with a factual report 
on the situation in the country. There is no talk of a widening 
gap between the general staff and the government, but the 
government realizes that when a warning comes from this quarter, 
it must be taken seriously. 
  RAPPORT was told that the warning could indicate possible 
crises before the election at the end of April. Experts believe 
that it could not have been easy for the general staff to inform 
the government of their observations, in view of the suspicion 
surrounding the defense force following the Goldstone 
Commission's raid on a section of military intelligence. They 
would also have wanted to ensure that they conveyed their 
information in good time. 
  A minister remarked to RAPPORT that "this information is so 
shocking one can hardly believe it." But he added that he 
personally had believed for some months that "something like 
this is possible." Another minister says bluntly: "I do not 
believe the information." 
  The warning by the general staff tallies with the exclusive 
information RAPPORT published last week: that fully equipped and 
trained right-wing groups are ready to resort to military 
protest. When RAPPORT asked whether it is true that officers on 
whose loyalty the government cannot count might be detained 
before the election -- a possibility which is not mentioned in 
the submission by the general staff -- no one could give a firm 
answer. 
  The fears of internment were raised this week in right-wing 
circles as well as in the security community. Right-wingers say 
it is odd that several police investigations are under way 
against suspected far-right activists, yet no arrests are taking 
place. They believe that the police will launch large-scale 
strikes against suspects at an opportune moment -- on the 
strength of piles of dossiers -- to prevent a possible take-over 
by violent means. 
  Security sources also fear that action will be taken against 
dissident serving members of the defense force and retired SADF 
members who over the years were involved in underground 
intelligence structures against the African National Congress, 
such as the Civil Cooperation Bureau, the Division of Covert 
Intelligence, Military Intelligence, Koevoet [police 
counterinsurgency unit] and the Askaris [former ANC guerrillas] 
of Vlakplaas. Last week RAPPORT reported that underground 
right-wing military plans have found support within the security 
community. On the day the report appeared two helicopters, a 
Dakota aircraft, and even troops were sent to Beestekraal near 
Brits to search for the weapons caches referred to by RAPPORT. 
  On Monday morning three trucks with black troops arrived in 
the area from Pretoria to help in the search. This caused great 
tension among right-wing farmers. It was confirmed to RAPPORT 
that after an exchange of harsh words between farmers' leaders 
and the defense force, it was agreed that black troops would not 
be deployed in the area again. 
  Meanwhile RAPPORT's report of last Sunday has sent shock 
waves through far-right underground planning structures. A 
"tongue lashing" over the leak was delivered "from the top." It 
also appears that several police generals in Pretoria were 
caught unawares by the report. Urgent meetings were called in 
the capital on Sunday night, and members of the Criminal 
Information Service -- the old security branch -- were summoned 
from Brits area to report on the situation. 
  It has also been reliably learned that the planned take-over 
of police stations by the far-right is causing deep concern to 
the South African Police General Staff. The report was high on 
the agenda the whole week at police headquarters, Wachthuis. 
Further investigation by RAPPORT indicated that only about two 
commando units in the western Transvaal are not controlled by 
right-wing structures. The far-right has also gained effective 
control over the commandos and their arsenals in almost the 
whole of rural Orange Free State, northern Natal, far northern, 
northern, and southern Transvaal. Everywhere so-called area 
protection units have affiliated with the commandos and will 
therefore be eligible to receive defense force weapons. 
  White Wolf Barend Strydom's wife Karin, his mother-in-law 
Trudy, and his father-in-law have apparently all been issued 
with semi- automatic weapons. They live near Hartbeespoort Dam 
in the Brits area. A very nervous source, rifle in hand, told 
RAPPORT: 
  -- There are four experts in the Brits area trained in the 
preparation of cyanide bullets. "These people also have pipes 
[probably anti-tank equipment] with which to take out tanks and 
armored vehicles." 
  -- A raid had been planned for last Sunday on the police 
base 
at Rosslyn outside Pretoria to get hold of more weapons. The 
target was described in detail to RAPPORT. An expert at opening 
door and safe locks, and whose name and address have been given 
to RAPPORT, has allegedly been involved in several incidents to 
date where he had to open locks to enable members of the 
underground structures to steal weapons and equipment. 
  -- The recent spate of bomb attacks on power and railway 
lines without the loss of life must be seen as part of an armed 
propaganda campaign which serves as a prelude to what lies ahead. 
  The fact that no trains loaded with black commuters have so 
far been blown up is ascribed to the fact that the far-right 
saboteurs do not wish to cause any harm to Zulus who might be on 
the trains.

<F P=106> [Transitional Executive Council Subcouncil on Law and Order </F>
Media Release issued 28 January on the SAPA PR Wire Service] 
  [Text] Security and stability (established under the 
Transitional Executive Council Act, No 151 of 1993) 
  1. Members of the subcouncil are: 
  Lt. Col. P. N. Bohlolo (United Peoples Front), 
  Adv Peter Gastrow (chairman) (Democratic Party), 
  Mr M.S. Gininda (Inyandza National Movement), 
  Lt. Gen. L. Malan (SA Government), 
  Mr Sydney Mufamadi (African National Congress), 
  Adv Gert Myburgh (National Party), 
  Mr Krish Naidoo (NIC/TIC) [Natal Indian Congress/Transvaal 
Indian Congress] 
  Maj. Gen. P.J. Nembambula (Venda Government) 
  2. Objects of the subcouncil: 
  See the copy of Sections 3 and 15 of the TEC [Transitional 
Executive Council] act annexed hereto. (not attached) The 
subcouncil has, inter alia, dealt with the following matters: 
  3. The establishment of a National Police Inspectorate: 
  The subcouncil has agreed on the details of a National 
Police 
Inspectorate which is to be established in terms of Section 
15(1)(a) and (b) of the TEC Inspectorate, which is to consist of 
a national component (five civilians, four SAP [South African 
Police] officers and four officers from other police forces) and 
nine regional inspectorates, one each for the nine regions 
demarcated in the interim constitution, which will each consist 
of one civilian, one SAP officer, one officer from any other 
police force operating in that region. A civilian is to be 
appointed director of the inspectorate. 
  The task of the Inspectorate is to assist the subcouncil to 
monitor police activities relating to the elections and the 
maintenance of a free political climate and to ensure that its 
decisions are properly acted on by the different police agencies 
in the RSA, self-governing states and TBVC [Transkei, 
Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] countries. The inspectorate will 
also monitor the deployment and control of police resources in 
relation to the policing of "political" violence and election 
activities. 
  It is proposed that the Inspectorate, which will be 
accountable to the subcouncil, will be established once all the 
parties represented in the TEC have had an opportunity to submit 
nominations for the civilian posts and once the various police 
forces have nominated police officers for the various positions. 
  4. The establishment of a national independent complaints 
mechanism: 
  The subcouncil has reached agreement on a new independent 
complaints mechanism envisaged in Section 15(1)(c) of the act. A 
credible and effective complaints mechanism is essential to the 
improvement of police-community relations in South Africa. This 
mechanism will come into being once ratified by the TEC, and the 
subcouncil proposes that it resorts under the Goldstone 
Commission. It will receive and investigate all complaints 
lodged by members of the public about alleged misconduct by 
members of the different police agencies. In order to ensure 
that there is one effective complaints mechanism during the 
period in which the TEC operates, it is proposed that: 
  (a) The Goldstone Commission also be tasked with the 
investigation referred to in Clause 3.2.4.1 of the National 
Peace Accord; 
  (b) The police reporting officers appointed in terms of the 
National Peace Accord should be assigned to the Goldstone 
Commission to staff this mechanism; 
  (c) Experienced investigators from the "complaints 
investigation units" or equivalent units of all policing 
agencies should be seconded to the mechanism, ie the Goldstone 
Commission, in order to assist with investigations; 
  (d) The TEC request the minister of justice not to proceed 
with the implementation of the provisions of the security 
officers Board of Enquiry Act of 1993 until this act is 
discussed by the subcouncil and the TEC and duly amended. This 
act also aims at establishing a complaints mechanism but 
reservations have been expressed about some of its provisions. 
  It is envisaged that the Goldstone Commission will appoint a 
suitable civilian as director of the independent complaints 
mechanism and that the commission will be at liberty to appoint 
local and foreign police or civilian experts to assist with the 
investigations. The complaints mechanism will be empowered to 
investigate complaints about police conduct relating to, inter 
alia, election related issues, serious and minor criminal 
offenses, contraventions of the National Peace Accord code of 
conduct, misconduct and infringements of regulations issued by 
the subcouncil or the TEC. 
  5. The establishment of a committee of experts: 
  In terms of Section 15(1)(e) of the TEC Act, the subcouncil 
has the power to establish a committee of experts to evaluate or 
monitor any aspect of policing relevant to the objectives of the 
TEC. The subcouncil has decided that the police board, 
established in terms of the National Peace Accord, provides an 
established and credible capacity for expert advice. For a 
number of practical and cost related reasons the subcouncil has 
decided not to establish a "standing committee" but to rather 
draw on the expertise of police board members and others and 
appoint them to a short-term committee of experts to investigate 
a particular issue as and when the need arises. Proposals in 
this regard are to be forwarded to the TEC for ratification. 
  [Text] 6. Rules and code of conduct for the police: 
  In terms of Section 15(1)(j) of the TEC Act the subcouncil 
is 
empowered to issue a new or amended code of conduct which shall 
be applicable to all members of all policing agencies. The 
subcouncil is further empowered under Section 15(7)(a) of the 
TEC Act to issue rules aimed at ensuring uniformity of conduct 
of members of all police agencies. The subcouncil took into 
account that the existing standing rules and orders of all the 
police agencies are virtually identical and has agreed on some 
additional rules which complement the existing ones. These rules 
focus mainly on promoting good police-community relations, on 
ensuring impartial and apolitical policing during the election 
and on the need for the police to ensure that no intimidation 
takes place. 
  The subcouncil agreed that the security forces code of 
conduct, contained in Chapter 4 of the National Peace Accord, 
should also remain the code governing the conduct of members of 
all police agencies. It is further provided that police 
officials shall accept the certified results of the election. 
  The rules and code of conduct for the police will be 
forwarded to the TEC for ratification before being implemented. 
  7. The co-ordinated control and command of different police 
agencies 
  In terms of Section 15(7)(a) of the TEC Act the subcouncil 
has, in co-operation with most other police agencies in the 
self-governing states and TVBC countries, agreed on the 
establishment of a "Transitional Policing Committee" which will 
ensure that co-ordination and uniformity exists amongst all 
policing agencies in the execution of their duties for the 
purpose of the TEC Act. A senior police officer from each of the 
policing agencies will serve on this committee which will meet 
once a week and report to the subcouncil. The Transitional 
Policing Committee will also have the task of formulating joint 
strategies to prevent intimidation, to ensure impartial policing 
of public political activities and to generally deal with the 
policing of the run-up to, and the election itself. 
  The proposals with regard to the above committee will be 
forwarded to the TEC for ratification before implementation. 
  8. The position of the Ciskei, Bophuthatswana and KwaZulu: 
  (a) Ciskei Police: The Ciskei has been co-operative and has 
responded to requests by the subcouncil to submit information 
and suggestions. It has been agreed that representatives from 
the Ciskei Police will form part of the substructures of the 
subcouncil once they formally become members of the TEC as 
required by the TEC act. 
  (b) KwaZulu Police: Despite requests the KwaZulu Police has 
not submitted any names of police officers to serve on the 
various sub-structures of the subcouncil. Requests for 
information, co-operation or proposals have met with the 
response that legal advice is being sought or that the relevant 
officer is not available and that a reply will be sent as soon 
as possible. There has therefore been no co-operation from the 
KwaZulu Police and the matter has been referred to the TEC for 
its attention. The subcouncil regards it as essential for the 
KwaZulu Police to co-operate in the same manner as other police 
agencies are doing in order to ensure effective and accountable 
policing to take place in the Natal/KwaZulu region during the 
election period. 
  (c) Bophuthatswana Police: There has been no response from 
the Bophuthatswana Police to requests from the subcouncil to 
supply information or to participate in its activities. The 
subcouncil is keen to involve the Bophuthatswana Police in all 
its structures and activities as it would assist in promoting 
free political activity in that country. The legal situation 
appears to be that, in terms of South African law, 
Bophuthatswana is an independent state and South African law 
does not apply in that state unless Bophuthatswana law so 
provides. The TEC Act does create the possibility of the TEC 
having jurisdiction in Bophuthatswana provided that the latter 
becomes a participant of the TEC. As this has not happened the 
TEC has no jurisdiction over Bophuthatswana. 
  9. Instability in northern Natal: 
  At the request of the TEC the subcouncil submitted a 
memorandum to the management committee of the TEC about the 
security situation in northern Natal. The subcouncil recommended 
inter alia that the SAP be urged to review the situation with a 
view to increasing the number of static reporting points in 
northern Natal in order to make their presence in the area more 
accessible to the community and that the SAP be urged to 
continue to liaise with the SADF [South African Defense Force] 
in order that the SADF provide manpower and logistical support 
as the situation warrants. 
  The subcouncil receives a weekly report from the SAP about 
the state of political violence in northern Natal. 
  10. Instability in Katlehong: 
  The violence in Katlehong, including statements emanating 
from Self Defence Units in the area, was raised in the 
subcouncil. At the initiative of the management committee of the 
TEC and others the whole matter of political violence and 
instability on the East Rand is being comprehensively addressed 
by a task group at national level and the subcouncil will await 
their recommendations before addressing the matter further. 
  11. Position of Captain Craig Kotze: 
  The subcouncil made representations to the minister of law 
and order about the undesirable situation of a police office 
acting as spokesperson for the political head of the SAP and 
thereby becoming involved in political controversy which affects 
the police force as a whole. The minister informed the 
subcouncil that Captain Kotze terminated his services in the SAP 
on 5 January 1994 and that since 6 January he has been employed 
as a consultant by the Ministry of Law and Order with the task 
of acting as spokesperson for the Ministry of Law and Order. 
  12. Violence and transport problems in the Western Cape: 
  The subcouncil discussed a request by the transport forum of 
the Western Cape regional peace committee to intervene in the 
transport dispute and the resultant violence in Kayalithsa, 
Gugulethu and Nyanga by securing protection by security forces 
for buses and their passengers. The subcouncil decided to 
acquaint itself with the issues first hand and to send a 
delegation from the subcouncil together with two civilian 
members of the police board to Cape Town in order to meet with 
the relevant role players in the area. A meeting will take place 
on Thursday 3 February.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  SUNDAY TIMES </H6>
  More of the Same--"The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] 
is giving South Africans an unpleasant foretaste of what to 
expect from a government of national unity if it is dominated 
politically by the ANC [African National Congress] and the 
National Party, and administratively by the existing civil 
service," an editorial in the Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in 
English on 30 January on page 18 notes. "In its brief existence, 
the TEC has wrapped itself in secrecy" and not "proved immune to 
other unsavoury habits of the Nationalist elites" such as 
"currency fiddles," avoiding import duties and "the far-flung 
pleasures of office"--foreign junkets. "As for the character of 
the new democracy, the instincts of the TEC are less than 
reassuring: much of its effort seems to have gone into 
surpressing Radio Pretoria," the editorial notes. "Fortunately, 
this phase of the transition is brief and, when the government 
of national unity comes into power, the protections of the 
interim constitution also comes into play." "But for the 
constitutional safeguards to be fully effective, we need in 
parliament as many people as possible who do not belong to the 
cosy alliance that now dominates the TEC." "If the TEC is any 
guide, the next five years will be similiar in many respects to 
the past five, only more so." 
<H6>  SUNDAY NATION </H6>
  Talks Boycotters--"South Africa stands on the threshold of 
what could be a major disaster as the constitutional settlement 
reached at the multiparty talks is regarded as not being 
inclusive by players within the Freedom Alliance (FA)," an 
editorial in the Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in English on 30 
January on page 10 states. "FA groupings are demanding more 
powers for the provinces and the abolition of a single ballot 
system" in the forthcoming elections. "However, some parties who 
oppose the one ballot system are either behaving hypocritically 
or have themselves to blame." "Inkatha chose the old-fashioned 
politics of boycott. It does not help the process of change when 
we behave like spoilt babies and later cry crocodile tears when 
our actions fail to derail negotiations." "If the IFP decides 
not to contest the elections, what will be the purpose of 
changing the one ballot system or even continuing to negotiate 
with it?" 
  ANC Manifesto--The second editortial of the SUNDAY NATION 
notes that the ANC's manifesto "looks like what the majority of 
South Africans may have been looking forward to," but the 
manifesto "is just a commitment and not the practical action." 
The manifesto concentrates on "the improvement of the delivery 
system" rather than "the availability of more resources. We 
therefore believe that, if this is the case, there is nothing 
unrealistic about ANC promises." "The manifesto sets a very high 
standard for other parties that are still to unveil theirs. We 
can only hope for better commitments which would make the lives 
of our countryfolk better than the old days of apartheid." 
<H6>  BEELD </H6>
  ANC-Farmers' Agreement Welcomed -- "Pragmatism was in 
evidence in the exploratory talks which took place this week 
between the Orange Free State Agricultural Union and the African 
National Congress [ANC]," notes an editorial on page 8 of the 
Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans of 26 January. "While several 
problems still remain to be resolved, according to the two 
parties, the meeting has already produced positive results, the 
most important being the undertaking by the ANC, under the 
leadership of Mr. Patrick Lekota, to do everything possible both 
before and after the election to ensure the safety of farmers 
and their right to property." "Just like the ANC, the farming 
community is a real part of the real South Africa. Both already 
play an important role in the country, and can continue to do so 
in the future." "Just as the ANC has recognized the rights of 
the farmers to their land, and does not intend to drive them off 
their land, so too the farmers must recognize the fundamental 
rights of their laborers and other black and brown fellow 
countrymen. For the Free State farmers it means that their 
province, in which blacks form the great majority, cannot become 
a white homeland." "Time and time again it has been shown that 
negotiations between parties which are serious, and are prepared 
to make pragmatic compromises, can succeed. The Free State 
farmers can show their colleagues in other parts of the country 
just what is possible." 
  "Enormous" Upliftment Task in East Rand -- A second 
editorial 
on page 8 of BEELD says: "What takes place in the war zones of 
the East Rand goes largely unnoticed by whites. But this does 
not mean that they or anyone else will not be touched by it. On 
the contrary. The extent of the upliftment task waiting, both 
social and political, is enourmous." "No normal society can be 
created before the culture of violence has been defeated. No 
political, economic, or social structure can remain in place 
while there are people who feel that peace is a joke when they 
have to live with murder." "We must remember that those are 
human beings living in the East Rand, people who also desire 
protection and a good life. No one can sleep peacefully while 
they have such restless neighbors."

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Harassment To Hamper Free, Fair Election--"The harassment 
and 
intimidation of National Party [NP] and Democratic Party 
supporters in townships across the country poses perhaps the 
biggest threat to a free and fair election," writes Kaizer 
Nyatsumba in his "One in Your Eye" column on page 12 of 
Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 31 January. "The ANC 
[African National Congress]--now seen by many as a 
government-in-waiting--has a deep interest in a free and fair 
election." When the ANC obtains its "landslide victory many 
psephologists believe it is heading for, its opponents must not 
be able to challenge the outcome of the election on the grounds 
that they could not reach certain parts of the country during 
their campaigning because of intimidation." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  Election `Show Business' Begins--National Party leader and 
state president, F.W. de Klerk, "has taken the bull by the horns 
and is ringing bells as he goes into black areas to tell them 
that the National Party has changed," notes a page-10 editorial 
in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 31 January. Mandela also 
took "a colourful train ride from Johannesburg station to Nasrec 
to launch the ANC's election manifesto." SOWETAN warns the 
public to be careful of this "show business" and more so when 
supporters' employers "bus them to rallies and buy them lunch 
and party hats." Voters should "demand" that all political 
parties "put their cards on the table on real concerns -- 
housing, jobs and schools, and most importantly, how to achieve 
peace." "The ANC has led the way with its manifesto. This and 
other manifestos must be studied carefully before important, 
historical decisions are made." 
<H6>  RAPPORT </H6>
  `Alarm Bells' Over ANC Martials at Polling Booths -- "The 
type of intimidation President F.W. de Klerk had to contend with 
on his election campaign of the Transvaal this weekend, 
especially from ANC ranks, raises the urgent question of whether 
a free and fair election is really possible in South Africa at 
this stage," begins a page-22 editorial in Afrikaans in 
Johannesburg RAPPORT on 30 January. "Earlier this week the ANC 
announced that it wants to deploy approximately 40,000 so-called 
peace martials, in ANC uniforms, at polling booths. This alone 
should set alarm bells ringing for all those who fear 
intimidation and confrontation on voting day." "Murder and 
mayhem has reached such alarming proportions that several black 
townships, housing millions of voters, is completely out of 
bounds to certain political parties." "If the state president 
with all his security finds it difficult to reach the voters, 
what will the fate be of candidates and organizers who have to 
embark on door to door campaigning as the election draws 
nearer." "After so many years Mr. Nelson Mandela has not yet 
succeeded in stopping his supporters from committing acts of 
violence." "How many non-ANC supporters will dare to make their 
way through rows of ANC `peacekeepers' to vote at the polls. It 
is obvious that the election cannot be postponed, but opponents 
of the ANC should guard against being forced to `get the 
election behind them, no matter how it proceeds.'" 
<H6>  BEELD </H6>
  ANC Supporters at Polling Booths Not 
Acceptable--Johannesburg 
BEELD in Afrikaans on 27 January cautions in a page-10 
editorial: "The ANC's plan to deploy about 40,000 of its 
so-called peace keepers in ANC uniforms near polling booths on 
election day `to see to it that the routes are open' is a recipe 
for intimidation and confrontation. If the ANC expects people 
to swallow its lame excuse about the deployment of these people, 
they are mistaken. Ask any victim of intimidation what a simple 
sideways glance can mean once the order has gone out from the 
`comrades' about what blacks can or cannot do." "This plan is 
nothing but a transparent and calculated strategy to try to 
intimidate people against exercising their democratic right on 
polling day. It makes no sense to deploy masses of people in 
party colors for a task which under normal circumstances must be 
done by the police and traffic police." "Rather, the ANC should 
do what the National Party is doing, and that is to promise firm 
action against any supporters guilty of intimidation or other 
methods which can interfere with a free and fair elction. Let 
polling day be a day of free choice for all voters, otherwise 
the credibility of the election result will be called into 
question. Should that hapen, we will face the prospect of the 
bloody Angolan path." 
  Editorial Laments Choice of Peacekeeping Force Head -- 
Another editorial on page 10 of BEELD says: "Every action of 
the National Peacekeeping Force in maintaining peace to ensure a 
free election will be watched with eagle eyes. One of the 
prerequisites for success is that the force remain impartial. 
The composition of the force is aimed at this. So it is a pity 
that someone whose name appears on the ANC's list of candidates 
in the forthcoming election has been appointed to command the 
force. We accept that Brigadier Gabriel Ramushwana's military 
background makes him a suitabmake it difficult to maintain the 
impartial image of the peace force. Since last year Brig. 
Ramushwana has been in the news for refusing to pay back 580,000 
rands allegedly paid to him incorrectly from the Venda pension 
fund. Brig. Ramushwana's appointle appointment. However, his 
high political profile, including his position as chief minister 
of Venda, will ment was probably the result of a compromise, but 
he does not appear to be the correct choice for such a sensitive 
position. The peace force needs to be cedible both in 
conception and birth."

  [Text] There is no longer room for further military 
adventures in Angola. The Armed Forces for the Liberation of 
Angola [FALA] are teaching a lesson in northern Angola. Our 
correspondent reported today that violent clashes are continuing 
in Bengo Province. The battle is being fought near 
Nambuangongo, where Eduardo dos Santos' troops are paying dearly 
for the cowardly adventure of the Futungo de Belas man. 
  In the past 24 hours, the enemy suffered 73 confirmed dead, 
leaving large quantities of Russian- and Brazilian-made war 
materiel near the commune of (Usu). Two KrAZ trucks carrying 
war materiel were captured yesterday on the (Caiengue)-(Usu) 
road. Troops assigned to the forward logistics position were 
completely neutralized. Also yesterday, an antitank missile was 
fired at and burned a Ural vehicle carrying mercenaries of 
unknown nationality. 
  Our correspondent cites the FALA operational commander for 
the Bengo Military Region as saying that the Popular Movement 
for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party's military adventure is 
doomed. He said the first clashes have proved FALA's combat 
superiority.

  [Text] The Angolan Government and the National Union for 
the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] may be holding peace 
talks in Lusaka, but inside Angola the UNITA rebels continue to 
resort to force on the ground. Early yesterday morning, UNITA 
took the diamond-rich area of Capaca, 30 km northeast of 
Saurimo, in Lunda Sul Province. Our correspondent reports: 
  Eight civilians were killed and three wounded in an 
(?operation) [words indistinct]. Meanwhile, the Angolan Armed 
Forces, FAA, Operational Command has reported that UNITA has 
been moving men and lethal equipment north, south, east, and 
[word indistinct] of Saurimo with a view to securing 
advantageous positions on the ground for subsequent offensive 
operations. 
  Yesterday, our news desk received a FAA Operational Command 
note saying that three people, including two women, were 
abducted [words indistinct] 27 km and 47 km along the roads 
linking Saurimo to UNITA-controlled [names indistinct] 
districts. That note also says that young men in 
UNITA-controlled areas are being forcibly drafted to strengthen 
the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola ranks. Despite 
that, the military authorities have described the situation in 
the area as calm.

  [Text] Lieutenant General Coelho "Nzuma," deputy commander 
for the Northeast Military Front, has said that the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] continues to 
talk the language of the guns. 
  [Begin "Nzuma" recording] We are aware that UNITA is 
assembling forces in the north, in the (Giata) area, across the 
Lombe River. They have also been gathering forces in the south, 
slightly north of Cagandala. We believe those units will be 
carrying out attacks within the next 24 to 48 hours. We are 
waiting for them. We are vigilant, and we are following these 
developments closely. We are taking measures so that the 
fighting will occur well away from Malange, so that the people 
are left alone. The only reason the enemy has not attacked yet 
is because it has suffered many losses. Nonetheless, [UNITA] 
General Chimuco has issued specific orders. Only yesterday, 
three UNITA soldiers turned themselves over. They were wearing 
their uniforms and had guns. They came from the area of 
Quissolo, and they confirmed that Gen. Chimuco ordered a new 
attack by the same military unit that was repelled on 23 
January. [end recording]

  [Text] Commonwealth envoys trying to strike a deal between 
the opposing factions of Lesotho's Army were supposed to be 
meeting 10 delegates from each side today with Lesotho's foreign 
minister. Trouble began over two weeks ago, when a section of 
the Army demanded a huge pay increase. Since then, there have 
been clashes around Maseru. A number of soldiers have been 
killed, and fears of a coup against Ntsu Mokhehle's government 
are in the air. There has even been talk of this other southern 
African peacekeeping force being sent in. On the line to 
Maseru, Timothy Ecott asked one of the Commonwealth envoys, Max 
Gaylard, how they had got on today. 
  [Begin recording] [Gaylard] Well, we had a very long day. We 
spent all of the morning with one of the two groups and spent 
all of the afternoon with the second group. Each group consists 
of 10 persons, soldiers, NCO's [noncommissioned officers], and 
junior officers, and that was the modus operandi. 
  [Ecott] And what did the two groups have to say to you? 
  [Gaylard] Well, we encouraged them in each case to talk to 
us 
and let us know their grievances and try to get to the bottom of 
the current difficulties. 
  [Ecott] And can you now, having met the two factions, 
explain 
what the problem is within the Lesotho Army? 
  [Gaylard] Well, I think it is a little bit early for me to 
pronounce on that. We have been here three days as you know, 
and I think some of the problems go back a bit further than 
that. But it was a constructive day, because I think we got two 
or three--not I think--we did get two or three quite strong 
commitments from both delegations, and I think the most 
important commitment to mention was the unequivocal commitment 
to the democratically elected Government of Lesotho. 
  [Ecott] But does that mean, though, that they will stop 
fighting each other, or is that a separate problem? 
  [Gaylard] Everything is connected, I suppose, in one way or 
another, but I was going to go on to say that a second common 
commitment from the two of them, there is no doubt that both 
sides don't want to fight anymore. They have stopped in the 
last three or four days. There is no guarantee right now that 
they won't start again, but I think it is less likely because 
the tensions have lessened. They are now into a procedure of 
talking. And, eventually, not in the near future, hopefully we 
will bring the two delegations together [word indistinct] the 
government, but they are committed to talks, there is no doubt 
about that. 
  [Ecott] But, at the moment, presumably, the two factions are 
still well armed, and they are still facing each other with the 
potential to start fighting if they feel that you are not 
solving their difficulties. 
  [Gaylard] Yes, yes, they are certainly armed. They are not 
exactly facing each other. I suppose, if you want to be 
technical, they are separated by four or five miles, the two 
main groups. But as I said, the tensions have lessened. We are 
hoping in the next one or two days that we will be able to 
control the talking process. 
  [Ecott] Can you, though, exactly explain in simple terms 
what 
the fight is all about, because that doesn't seem to have been 
adequately explained by anyone? 
  [Gaylard] It is a little bit early to give you a definitive 
answer on that, but I can say that it is a fight between two 
factions of the Army. What I am suggesting is that it is not an 
antigovernment problem, as far as we can see. In fact, today, 
as I say, both were at pains to tell us that they supported the 
government. 
  [Ecott] And what is the government's role and view of the 
situation now? 
  [Gaylard] Well, you would want to talk to government itself 
about that, but our position is that our bottom line is that we 
are here to support the government in its efforts to resolve the 
problem. Now, what they have done is facilitate our role as 
facilitators, if you like, and that has been no easy task, even 
just getting into barracks--that had to be arranged by 
government and has been done. Of course, in our early meetings 
with the troops, we accompanied a minister from government who 
addressed the troops in both camps. [end recording]

  [Text] Representatives of the Commonwealth Secretariat, Dr. 
Moses Anafu and Mr. Maxwell Gaylard, are attempting to persuade 
the disgruntled soldiers of the Royal Lesotho Defense Force to 
leave their defensive positions in the hills around the capital, 
Maseru. Dr. Anafu told Channel Africa that the soldiers had 
agreed in principle to leave their positions and return to their 
barracks at Makoanyane and (Ha Rakamose) just outside the 
capital. 
  Mr. Gaylard said discussions with the two fighting Army 
factions were continuing, with both sides having expressed 
loyalty to the Lesotho Government. Lesotho Foreign Affairs 
Minister Molapo Qhobela told Channel Africa that his government 
wanted the Commonwealth to take as much time as necessary to 
talk to the soldiers and resolve the conflict.

  [Text] A Commonwealth secretariat representative has 
expressed cautious optimism that his mission is close to a 
breakthrough in resolving the military crisis in Lesotho. Mr. 
Maxwell Gaylard said that they had managed to get the two 10-man 
delegations from the rival factions within the Royal Lesotho 
Defense Force together for a meeting in Maseru. He said he was 
optimistic that this was the beginning of a significant 
breakthrough, although the Commonwealth still intended to bring 
the two sides together for more substantial talks. Troops from 
the two factions are still in position in the hills around 
Maseru.

  [Text] The tripartite working group comprising Botswana, 
Zimbabwe, and South Africa, is holding urgent negotiations with 
various groups in Lesotho in a bid to resolve the crisis in that 
country. South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha said in 
Pretoria that the group was analyzing the situation and had 
initiated multiparty negotiations. He said differences between 
the opposing military factions appeared to involve more than a 
dispute on salary increases. A report is to be submitted to the 
governments of the working group countries this weekend, and the 
foreign ministers of the three countries will probably meet on 
Monday to discuss the report.

  [Text] The British minister of state for foreign and 
Commonwealth affairs and minister of overseas development, 
Baroness Lynda Chalker, has warned that the removal by force of 
the Lesotho Government would have serious repercussions for the 
development cooperation with Lesotho. In a statement released 
by the British High Commission in Maseru yesterday, Baroness 
Chalker said the British Government is deeply concerned at the 
fighting that has taken place between elements of the Royal 
Lesotho Defense Force. She pledged support for the efforts of 
the Commonwealth's secretary general who is doing everything 
possible to help make arrangements for certain Commonwealth 
countries to assist Lesotho at this difficult time. 
  A fact-finding mission, which is made up of Army generals 
and 
commanders of Botswana, Zimbabwe, and South Africa arrived in 
the country this morning to assess the situation here. A series 
of meetings are scheduled between the army leadership and the 
Commonwealth envoys following previous meetings that took place 
yesterday.

  [Text] Antananarivo, Jan 28 (AFP)--Rioters burned about a 
dozen shops and homes of traders of Indian and Pakistani origin 
in the Madagascan town of Antsirabe, 175 kilometres (110 miles) 
south of here, officials said Friday [28 January]. 
  A nighttime curfew was imposed on the town after Thursday's 
incidents, which accompanied a strike by government workers and 
schoolteachers, whose representatives met Civil Service Minister 
Henri Rakotovololona. 
  Troublemakers got out of control and began attacking the 
stores of the traders, known as Karanas, when schoolchildren 
took to the streets as the negotiations were under way, 
witnesses said. 
  Police used tear gas and made two arrests as the 
demonstrators subsequently went to residential districts and set 
the homes of some Karanas ablaze. 
  The wealth and success of the Indo-Pakistani community is in 
stark contrast to the poverty of many residents in the 
industrial town, which saw a similar outbreak of anti-Karana 
rioting in 1987, observers said. 
  The 28,000 Karana control about 40 percent of the economy of 
the Indian Ocean island, according to estimates, and the 
community has not merged with other Malagasy peoples, even if 
most of its members have lived in the country for four or five 
generations.

  [Excerpt] The British minister of state for foreign and 
commonwealth affairs and overseas development, Baroness Lynda 
Chalker, said today that the government will assist Malawi to 
rehabilitate areas holding Mozambican refugees after they have 
been voluntarily repatriated. Baroness Chalker was speaking 
after visiting (Pawanyi) refugee camp in Mwanza. She said 
Britain was pleased to be involved in the care of the Mozambican 
refugees through, among other things, the provision of materials 
for use in the camps. 
  Earlier, the national coordinator for refugees in Malawi, 
Mr. 
(Alfred Ntara), said that since the signing of the peace accord 
between the Mozambican Government and the Renamo movement, 
345,000 Mozambicans have freely gone back home. Mr. (Ntara) 
however said there was need to rehabilitate the refugee-holding 
areas because of the wanton cutting down of trees which has 
taken place in these areas. 
  There were nearly 1.6 million Mozambican refugees in Malawi 
before the signing the Mozambican peace accord. 
  And speaking in Lilongwe at the official hangover of the 
Lilongwe-Salima road to the Malawi Government, Baroness Chalker 
explained that an effective road network was vital to the 
country's development. She said that the 15 million pounds 
which her government provided for reconstructing the road was 
the largest aid package to Malawi in recent years and calls for 
proper utilization and maintenance of the road. 
  In his remark at the ceremony, the minister of works, 
Honorable Jodder Kanjere, expressed gratitude for the support 
the British Government renders to the Malawi Government. Hon. 
Kanjere said it was the wish of the Malawi Government that the 
cordial relations between Malawi and Britain should continue in 
all spheres of development in the country. He said that the 
road will boost Malawi's tourism industry as it is the main link 
between the east and the west. The construction of the 78.4 km 
road began in 1990 and ended in September last year. The road 
was constructed at a total cost of 62 million kwacha. 
  Baroness Chalker has since left the country at the end of a 
three-day visit to Malawi. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Mozambique National Resistance (Renamo) </F>
leader Alfonso Dhlakama by Luis Nascimento; place and date not 
given; followed by interview with Mozambican President Joaquim 
Chissano by unidentified correspondent; place and date not 
given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] Alfonso Dhlakama is accusing the 
international community of neglecting Mozambique. In an 
interview with Luis Nascimento, he accuses President Chissano of 
wasting public funds. 
  [Begin recording] [Dhlakama] I am not happy, I am not happy, 
because my party does not have infrastructures a party should 
have. What we are complaining about is the promises made by the 
international community, as well as our Frelimo [Mozambique 
Liberation Front] brothers, who have not provided us with the 
buildings that they had promised and that are contained in the 
Rome agreement that we signed. Therefore, I am not happy with 
the aid, the promises, because it all has been restricted to 
promises and they have not been followed up. 
  [Nascimento] Within this context, are you going to keep 
contact? Are you going to continue holding regular meetings 
with President Chissano? 
  [Dhlakama] Of course, of course. I will be discussing with 
him, for example, one of the issues pending. I will remind you 
that, at the first summit we held back in August last year, I 
had proposed that he, as head of state, should accept the 
setting up of an economic and social council that might include 
Renamo, Frelimo, and other, unarmed parties. That council would 
supervise or control the use of state funds and would monitor 
all foreign investment and keep control over all the state 
funds. The government, through President Chissano, rejected 
this proposal. I am waiting for him to come back so we can 
resume this discussion because I am not happy because I know 
that the government is using state funds, state vehicles, and 
state buildings for its political activities. Therefore, I do 
not understand how, at a time of transition like this, Frelimo 
continues to control all state funds and makes use of them for 
its own campaigning. 
  [Nascimento] You have been quoted by international agencies 
as having said that Renamo may at any time suspend the 
confinement of its troops if this situation, these government 
delays, continue. Do you maintain that threat? 
  [Dhlakama] Well, I could have done it already, because 
Frelimo has confined very few of its troops so far. The only 
thing is that if I did that, I would be helping Frelimo 
implement its maneuvers. Therefore we do not want to help those 
Frelimo tactics. That is why we have not yet suspended troop 
confinement, but Frelimo continues to not confine its troops. 
[end recording] 
  [Announcer] Those were the Renamo leader's accusations. We 
then listened to the Mozambican president. President Chissano 
stated he will be talking to the Renamo leader and everything 
will be sorted out: 
  [Begin recording] [Chissano] Because those questions have 
been raised by Mr Dhlakama, I will answer him and because he 
talked to the press that way, I do not know whether he will ask 
me about those problems in the same way, I do not know. 
Therefore I prefer to talk to him since he wants to talk to me. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] And as far as the delays in 
confinement, the alleged delays by the government? 
  [Chissano] Well, as far as satisfying your curiosity is 
concerned -- and his too and I will answer him -- but if you 
want to ask me then I would tell you that we are dealing with 
those matters in the appropriate places. Before I left 
Mozambique, I met Mr. Ayello and other members of the CST [not 
further identified], and subsequently I met with my aides and 
was pleased to observe that some measures are being taken for 
the troop confinement process to be speeded up because, after 
all, this is simply a technical issue, not a political issue. 
Well, at the time, there was a slowdown, but there may be, and 
there really is already, a speeding up, which may increase. 
  [Correspondent] If there is no change, Mr Aldo Ayello said 
it 
today himself, the UN Security Council may react against the 
Mozambican Government. 
  [Chissano] Of course, of course. There may be. From the 
moment you can see there is bad faith from the government, I 
will find it legitimate for you to be concerned. So far, there 
has been no sign of bad faith, and therefore I feel optimistic 
that it will all go well. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Mozambique has already entered its preelection 
campaign.

  [Text] Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the Mozambique National 
Resistance [Renamo], has postponed his trip to South Africa, 
which was scheduled for tomorrow, until 4 February due to 
organizational problems. 
  Dhlakama explained that the trip has been postponed because 
contacts "with some South African businessmen," whom he did not 
identify, have not been confirmed. The Renamo leader also said 
he does not have confirmation on his meeting with the National 
Party, but his supporters in South Africa "are making sure that 
the meeting takes place." 
  He stated that the visit is aimed at establishing friendship 
ties between Renamo and South African parties, including Nelson 
Mandela's African National Congress [ANC]. 
  "The planned visit to Portugal and Spain will still take 
place in February," but the dates have not yet been set. 
  Meanwhile, Afonso Dhlakama said that he met with U.S. 
Ambassador to Mozambique Dennis Jets in Maputo on 27 January, 
with whom he discussed issues linked to the implementation of 
the peace process. 
  Afonso Dhlakama said "I am the one who requested the meeting 
with the U.S. ambassador to discuss the peace process, and for 
me to explain my concerns with the Social Economic Council," 
adding that he discussed the same issue with UN Special 
Representative Aldo Ajello. 
  Dhlakama said "both the U.S. ambassador and Dr. Ajello found 
Renamo to be right and said that it is up to Renamo to convince 
the Mozambican Government on this issue". 
  The Renamo leader reiterated that he will continue "fighting 
for Renamo's right to know how the Mozambique Liberation Front 
[Frelimo] is managing state funds, because, in South Africa for 
instance, the ANC does not allow the government to use a cent 
without its knowledge." 
  Some observers noted, however, that the South African 
Government and the ANC "guide themselves through an agreement, 
and that the Mozambican Government and Renamo also guide 
themselves, or should guide themselves, through the agreement 
signed by both--that is, the situations are completely 
different, as there are differences between ANC and Renamo."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article] </F>
  [Text] Jose de Castro, a Mozambique National Resistance 
[Renamo] official heading his movement's preparations for the 
electoral process, told NOTICIAS that it was in a gesture of 
goodwill that his party granted three out of 13 available seats 
in the STAE [Elections Administration Technical Secretariat] to 
all political parties excluding the Mozambique Liberation Front 
[Frelimo]. 
  The STAE is made up of 50 members, 50 percent of which are 
from the government, 25 from the United Nations, and the 
remaining percentage for all political parties excluding Frelimo. 
  Jose de Castro said the unarmed opposition parties are 
ungrateful when they demand seats in the STAE, since during the 
debate on Electoral Law they said they renounced their right to 
fill the seats in that electoral organ in favor of the 
government. 
  Jose de Castro stated that Renamo fought for those seats 
and, 
today, the unarmed opposition parties are demanding the seats we 
fought for until we achieved victory. They are ungrateful. He 
added that the unarmed opposition should recognize the efforts 
made by Renamo, beginning with the negotiations in Rome, through 
the donors' conference, and up to the multiparty conference, to 
defend the interests of the unarmed parties in the process of 
the country's democratization. 
  He said that Renamo is surprised by the attitude of these 
political parties. Recognizing their political immaturity, 
however, we are going to grant them only three seats. 
  Castro said that he had already foreseen a controversy over 
this issue. And for this reason, he presented to the government 
a draft list with 13 members. 
  He said, we do not see any problem with this. We will have 
to sacrifice three of our members in STAE in favor of the 
unarmed opposition. 
  Meanwhile, a source from the unarmed opposition parties 
yesterday told our reporter that he is not happy with the three 
seats granted by Renamo, and he thinks Renamo should grant a 
minimum of four seats. 
  Confronted with this situation, Jose de Castro said Renamo 
has done its best and it will not do the impossible. 
  He said, we have granted them three seats, this is all we 
can 
do. 
  Meanwhile, the unarmed opposition seems to be a little 
divided, because Wehia Ripua, leader of Pademo [Mozambique 
Democratic Party], who was questioned on the issue, said his 
party is not interested in having seats in the STAE or the 
National Elections Commission. 
  Ripua said that, for Pademo, the most important thing is 
ensuring that these electoral organs operate fully so that the 
unarmed opposition parties, which are the less privileged in 
this process, operate normally. Why should there be a 
controversy over this process? Pademo is against this. 
  The unarmed opposition is expected to meet soon to map out 
its strategy over this issue.

  [Text] Gilberto Chirinza, Mozambique National Resistance 
[Renamo] representative in Maputo, said on 25 January that the 
Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] is hampering Renamo 
political work in Maputo Province. He added that Matutuine 
District Administrator Joao Namedinga has been making it 
difficult for Renamo to coordinate its activities. After Renamo 
holds a meeting with the people, [Frelimo] activisit groups 
proceed to contradict Renamo's messages. Chirinza also said 
that another problem is the absence of premises for Renamo to 
have offices in various areas of Maputo Province. 
  That Renamo official noted that despite those difficulties, 
his party continues to work to show its true image to the people 
of Maputo Province. 
  [Begin recording] [Chirinza] Frelimo, (?like the government) 
has been creating many difficulties. For instance, the [words 
indistinct] that have been created in terms of the General Peace 
Accord and which are not functioning yet because, quite simply, 
they lack government permission. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] How do you view the work that 
should be done in view of the upcoming elections? 
  [Chirinza] For its part, Renamo is doing very serious work 
with the people because we have to clean up the picture painted 
by Frelimo. We have to improve our image with the people, so 
they become aware that Renamo is not what Frelimo made it out to 
be for so many years. 
  [Correspondent] Have you experienced any difficulties in 
your 
political work in Maputo Province? 
  [Chirinza] (?Very much so) because the government is 
creating 
so many problems. There is a shortage of premises and 
transportation. The government is aware that it is the UN 
Operations in Mozambique that provides us with vehicles but at 
this stage the vehicles have not been released without any 
justification. [end recording] 
  When Radio Mozambique approached Marciano da Cruz, 
provincial 
director for support and control, and acting governor while 
Governor Raimundo Bila is on leave, he said that there are legal 
avenues for Renamo to express concerns, rather than through the 
press. He added that the provincial government is ready to 
cooperate with Renamo and do its best to solve that party's 
problems in accordance with means available locally. He also 
noted that he had no information about the behavior of Activist 
Groups in Matutuine District, because the local administrator 
has not reported any unusual incidents to the provincial 
government.

  [Text] The government is to spend 686.8 million [as heard] 
kwacha in this year's budget, which seeks to promote growth and 
stability in the economy. The minister of finance, Ronald 
Penza, said the current expenditure accounts for 462.2 billion 
kwacha of the amount, while capital expenditure accounts for 
224.2 billion kwacha. In giving the breakdown when he presented 
the 1994 budget to parliament, Mr. Penza said personal 
emoluments have been allocated 65.4 billion kwacha, defense and 
security 26.2 billion kwacha, cost financing 60 billion kwacha, 
and 12 billion kwacha for wage adjustment. He said the 
expenditure will be financed by revenues from domestic resources 
and external assistance. 
  Mr. Penza said that the expenditure is forecast on the 
social 
sector, which includes education, health, water, and sanitation. 
Mr. Penza has said that the government has set up a special 
unit at the Ministry of Finance to monitor public expenditure. 
He said all government departments will be closely monitored to 
ensure accountability and avoid financial mismanagement. 
  Meanwhile, the minister of finance, Mr. Penza, has said that 
the government has no intention of fixing exchange rate, but 
will be [words indistinct] instruments to minimize the 
fluctuations of the exchange rate. Mr. Penza said that with low 
inflation and positive interest rates, the government will now 
work toward stabilizing the exchange rates. 
  Mr. Penza also announced that all parastatal companies under 
Zimco [Zambia Industrial and Mining Corporation] will from now 
on start paying their dividends directly to the government. The 
finance minister has said that the move is aimed at ensuring 
that there will be no further wastage of public resources, 
adding that Zimco, the company to which these companies pay 
their dividends, is no longer effective. Mr. Penza also 
announced that the establishment of an independent unit which 
will supervise parastatal companies would be privatized.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Whites who fled Rhodesia when it became Zimbabwe and 
who are now thinking of returning are not going to be welcomed 
back with open arms. Thousands of Rhodies, as they are known, 
fled to South Africa. They are now worried about developments 
there and are thinking of returning, but the Zimbabwe Government 
has plans to tighten up its immigration laws. On the line to 
Harare, Alice Martin asked (Fry Mgazi) what the new government 
proposals were: 
  [Begin recording] [(Mgazi)] Well, the proposals will be 
tabled in parliament very shortly, and there are four major ones 
that I would mention here: First of all, Zimbabwean-born 
noncitizens will lose their automatic right to live in the 
country, and, secondly, the government will now have the power 
to stop what are called marriages of convenience, whereby people 
get married in order to stay in this country. The other changes 
that are very interesting include the listing of a number of 
crimes, if convicted for which somebody can be declared a 
prohibited immigrant and, perhaps most interesting of all, is 
[word indistinct] 10 years for immigrants to be regarded as 
permanent residents. At present, it only takes two years of 
local residence in this country, but now it is going to take 10 
years. 
  [Martin] Who do you think these laws are aimed at? 
  [(Mgazi)] The one that has raised eyebrows is the one that 
says that people will now lose the automatic right to live in 
this country, even if they are Zimbabwean-born noncitizens. 
Now, that is likely to affect most of all people who were 
resident in Rhodesia, then, because most of them were 
ex-Rhodesians who either emigrated to South Africa or Britain 
soon after independence. [sentence as heard] A lot of them have 
been applying to come back to Zimbabwe, unsuccessfully, but once 
this change becomes law, as it is widely expected to be in a 
very short space of time, then it is going to be extra difficult 
for them to come back and live in Zimbabwe again. 
  [Martin] What is the position on their properties and their 
land? Would they just be trying to reclaim properties they had 
before? Is that what the point of this immigration law is about? 
  [(Mgazi)] Not really, but when some of them left, they did 
not sell their properties. A large number of them did, but the 
majority did not. They either left relatives or friends in 
charge of their properties, so when they come back, it is not a 
question of them having to look for new properties as such. 
They will be coming back to their old properties. 
  [Martin] What is public opinion like, on this issue? 
  [(Mgazi)] Strangely enough, no voices of disapproval have 
been heard. I mean, it is two days since the proposal [word 
indistinct] were published in the government gazette, but as yet 
nobody has been heard to voice any disapproval of government 
intention to overhaul the Immigration Act. I mean, even the 
political parties who are known to oppose anything that 
government does....[pauses] If there is any resentment, it will 
be targeted at the ex-Rhodesians who left after independence 
because the main reason why they left was that they could not 
live under black majority rule and they decided to go to settle 
in South Africa. But black majority is imminent in South 
Africa, and they are caught between the devil and the deep blue 
sea. [end recording]

  [Text] On Saturday, the government of the Central African 
country of Burundi sacked all members of the Constitutional 
Court because they refused to accept the appointment of the new 
president, Cyprien Ntaryamira. 
  The announcement was made in Brussels by the Burundi 
Embassy. 
  Two weeks ago the Burundi parliament chose the Agriculture 
Minister, a Hutu, Ntaryamira to succeed President Ndadaye also 
from the Hutu people. He was killed in a failed coup d'etat 
three months ago. 
  The constitutional successor was also killed in the coup. 
Due to the unsettled state of the country it was impossible to 
hold general elections. 
  After the impasse the two Hutu judges of the Constitutional 
Court resigned. The other five, all Tutsis, have now been 
dismissed. 
  The embassy says that Ntaryamira's nomination as president 
can now be ratified.

  [Text] Mogadishu, 31 Jan (AFP)--At least three Somalis were 
killed and seven hurt in southern Mogadishu early Monday [31 
January] by gunfire which witnesses blamed on U.S. soldiers. An 
AFP correspondent saw the bodies of two women and one man on the 
road leading to the airport. One of the dead had his arm blown 
off. There was no immediate confirmation of the clash from 
either U.S. military or UN sources. 
  "He was sitting by the road. He wasn't doing anything," said 
a relative of another victim, who was shot in the head. A 
child, less than 10 years old, was hit in the throat while a man 
had his wrist blown up by a high-caliber bullet. Panic spread 
in the crowded streets shortly after the firing erupted, with 
passers-by screaming: "It's the Americans, It's the Americans."

employment, has just resigned. This brings to three the number 
of ministers who have resigned from Prime Minister Carlos 
Veiga's cabinet. This spate of resignations is reportedly 
linked to influence peddling within the party, the Movement for 
Democracy. It came to power following the January 1991 
parliamentary elections which ended the 17-year rule of the 
African Party for the Independence of Guinea- Bissau and Cape

<F P=106> [By Monica Oosterbroek] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 29 SAPA--The hopes and aspirations 
of millions of poverty-stricken squatters across South Africa 
are set to soar with the announcement of the African National 
Congress's [ANC] election manifesto announced on Saturday. 
Launching the manifesto at Nasrec outside Soweto, ANC President 
Nelson Mandela said the future government billed increased jobs 
with higher incomes, housing with electricity and water, 
education and health care as priorities. 
  The theme of the ANC's election manifesto is "a better life 
for all". Apart from promising to uphold all the basic 
conditions experienced in an ideal democratic society, the ANC 
have an ambitious reconstruction and development programme. An 
ANC government hopes to be successful in stopping the violence, 
which will encourage foreign investment. Thus with expectations 
of a dynamic and growing economy, the ANC plans to address the 
high unemployment. 
  Their national public works programme alone promises 
training 
and jobs for about 2.5 million people over the next 10 years, 
building roads and much-needed facilities. 
  Education was also a top priority and the ANC plan to use 
the 
R[Rand]23 billion already set aside for education to give, among 
other education programmes, all youths 10 years of free and 
compulsory education and double the number of free text books 
  The ANC promise to focus on the seven million squatters and 
homeless by tackling the housing crisis. They promise that 
within the next five years, an ANC government could build over 
one million new homes, provide running water and flush toilet to 
more than one million families and electrify 2.5 million rural 
and urban homes. 
  As for land reform, the ANC government will guarantee 
victims 
of forced removals restitution, to be carried out fairly through 
a land claims court. State land will be used to implement land 
reform. Health will become more affordable under an ANC 
government with cheaper treatment and medicines and free health 
care for children under five years old 
  Overall, the ANC plans to increase public expenditure 
without 
raising taxes on ordinary people. The ANC will end vat on basic 
foods like flour, milk and sugar, reduce income taxes on those 
earning under R4,000 a month and end unfair taxation of women, 
married and single. But they will make sure every business pays 
its fair share. 
  By investing in jobs, housing and education, the ANC believe 
the economy will grow and bring in more revenue. They are also 
relying on beneficial international aid and loans. Plus, their 
objective is to carefully use money available carefully without 
squandering funds to corruption and bureaucracy, as in the past. 
  All security forces will be reformed to reflect the national 
character and a new volunteer army will deal with the defence of 
the country without being involved in political matters. 
  Detention without trial will be done away with and the 
system 
of justice will be made more accessible, cheap and fair to 
everyone. 
  In foreign affairs, the ANC government will become a full 
member of the Organisation of African Unity, United Nations, 
non-aligned movement, the Commonwealth and other international 
bodies. 
  The question is: Can Mr Mandela fulfill these extravagant 
campaign promises? Criticism has already begun. 
  Vague on many vital question like taxation and land reform, 
it could give masses the impression they will be all be enjoying 
the living standards of the white middle class. 
  Critics say the manifesto was irresponsible and could create 
problems. Should the sad reality not meet their expectations, 
there are fears their disillusionment could turn to violence. 
  So far, Mr Mandela has been careful to avoid making wild 
promises. He has been reported as saying it could take "some 
years" for a government to respond fully to the need of black 
people after 300 years of white supremacy. 
  As the ANC stressed in their manifesto, only if everyone 
works together in an environment of peace and stability, can 
their plans succeed.

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 29 SAPA -- A future African 
National Congress [ANC] government would strive to reach 
national consensus on policy issues in a constituent assembly 
whatever the size of its majority, ANC President Nelson Mandela 
said on Saturday. He was presenting the ANC's three-pillar 
election manifesto at Nasrec, south-west of Johannesburg, which 
promises good form of government, a better quality of life for 
South Africans and end to crime and violence. 
  The document is moderate in tone and bases the promises it 
makes on a growing economy. Mr Mandela conceded that 
implementation and financing of the programme would not be easy. 
  "Our objective is to use resources more efficiently and not 
to increase the tax burden. Large sums of money already go to 
education, health and other areas. But the results are poor," Mr 
Mandela said. 
  The ANC would encourage an open and democratic society and 
would respect a bill of rights. Government corruption and 
dishonesty would not be tolerated. 
  Turning to the second pillar of the manifesto, Mr Mandela 
warned that South Africa's economy would no longer be run for 
the benefit of the white minority. The manifesto prioritises job 
creation and better incomes in a growing economy, marked by 
increased foreign investment, a public works programmes 
providing 2.5-million jobs over the next 10 years and more 
roads, schools, clininc and houses. Small business would be 
encouraged and rural poverty eliminated through development 
programmes. 
  Woman and those earning under R[Rand]4,000 a month are 
promised a better tax deal. 
  The manifesto says the security forces will be refomed to 
reflect the national gender and character of South Africa. 
"Criminal behaviour in these forces will not be tolerated. Those 
serving today will be encouraged to continue in line with the 
new culture," the manifesto said. 
  It promises that with the cooperation of commmunities, an 
ANC-government will ensure criminals are dealt with to the full 
extent of the law. "The ANC recognises the depth of our 
country's crisis. We are convinced that political will, an 
environment of peace and stability and a technically sound 
programme are a sure foundation for reconstruction and 
development. 
  "The ANC pledges to spare no effort to reach these ideals. 
We 
are ready to tackle the problems."

<F P=106> [Telephone report from Lusaka by correspondent Joao Ligio] </F>
  [Text] The second round of Angolan peace talks in Lusaka 
has for the last three days been stuck on the modalities for 
implementing the protocol concerning an understanding on the 
future national police force. The mediators have not yet found 
the magic word that will clear the reasoning of the Black 
Cockerel negotiators. It was necessary for UN Special 
Representative Alioune Blondin Beye to resort to his rudest 
vocabulary to get the National Union for the Total Independence 
of Angola [UNITA] to behave in a manner more compatible with the 
spirit and letter of the aims of peace--particularly because 
there is also an urgent need for this great undertaking to 
succeed. 
  The UN special representative managed to get UNITA to reduce 
its demands for participation in the future national police from 
45 to 25 percent. He also managed to get UNITA to lower its 
demands for participation in the Riot Police from 50 to 30 
percent. Nonetheless, those figures are still much higher than 
the 5 to 10 percent proposals put forth by the mediator and the 
government. It is for this reason that, over the last three 
days, the pressing [preceding word in English] has been applied 
and will continue to be applied unilaterally on the UNITA side.

  [Text] Addis Ababa, 31 Jan (PANA) -- Ethiopia added its 
voice Monday [31 January] to the increasing calls for the 
revitalisation of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) to 
meet the various challenges facing Africa. 
  "The effort to increase the effectiveness and the 
administrative capacity of the organisation is an issue which 
should always be given top priority," Ethiopia President Meles 
Zenawi said. He was addressing the 59th ordinary session of the 
OAU Council of Ministers which opened Monday in the Ethiopian 
capital, Addis Ababa. 
  Revitalisation of the organisation, he said, would remain 
elusive unless member states made a greater effort to support it 
financially. Member states owe the organisation at least 69 
million US dollars in arrears of contributions, as at the end of 
December 1993. 
  Out of an assessed contribution of 24.76 million dollars for 
the 1993/94 financial year, only 3.93 million dollars, 
representing 16 per cent, was received by the secretariat by the 
end of 1993. 
  "The gravity of this rather gloomy picture of the financial 
situation," the OAU said, "should be viewed in the context of 
the ever mounting responsibilities that are being entrusted to 
the organisation." 
  Virtually all the member states owe the OAU large sums of 
money. However, Algeria, Botswana, Egypt, Lesotho, Mauritius, 
Mauritania, Namibia, Nigeria, Senegal, Swaziland, Tanzania and 
Zimbabwe are up to date with their contributions. 
  Meles said that Africa had little hope of achieving peace 
and 
development without enhanced cooperation among African 
countries. He said the OAU was the only vehicle Africa had "to 
ensure greater cooperation in both the political and economic 
areas among our countries." He lamented on the conflicts in a 
number of African countries and said these had been among major 
factors behind Africa's economic difficulties and poverty. "It 
is also the prime reason for the growing marginalisation of our 
continent and for the image of hopelessness that we have 
projected in the world," he said. 
  An estimated 7 million Africans have died, in the last three 
decades, as a result of the civil strife and political crises. 
Another 20 million Africans are today refugees and displaced 
persons. There is political and military insecurity in Angola, 
Congo, Burundi, South Africa, Mozambique, Liberia, Sudan, 
Somalia, Liberia, Zaire. 
  Meles said if Africa, through the OAU, did not take 
responsibility for the resolution of conflicts in the continent, 
"the possibility for others to do it for us, and to do it in a 
way that is not always constructive, was one of the major 
dangers we face". The OAU and its central organ for conflict 
resolution, he added, have a number of potential and actual 
conflict situation which they need to monitor closely. "But no 
where will the ability of the OAU to be a decisive factor for 
peace more tested that in South Africa," he said. 
  That country's first multiracial elections are scheduled for 
27 April. He said members states had a historic responsibility 
to ensure that South Africa's inevitable emergence as a 
non-racial and democratic society was not marred by violence 
threatened by those not willing to participate in the elections. 
That reference is the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party led by 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi. 
  The OAU has an observer mission in South Africa, but the 
mission needs to be expanded for it to monitor effectively the 
elections.

  [Text] Addis Ababa, 31 Jan (PANA)--The OAU, anxious to see 
a non-racial and democratic society established in South Africa, 
has appealed to each African government to send at least two 
observers to monitor the first non-racial elections in South 
Africa in April. "Today Africa stands at the door of total 
political liberation as apartheid is about to be relegated to 
the ignominy of history", the organisation's secretary general, 
Salim Ahmed Salim said. 
  Addressing the 59th session of the OAU Council of Ministers 
which began in Addis Ababa Monday, Salim said at a time when 
South Africa was undergoing fundamental transformation, Africa 
which had invested so much energy and resources in support of 
the liberation movements must make its presence felt in that 
country. 
  He told the foreign ministers that Africa had a 
responsibility to South Africa and must sustain interest and 
keep the momentum of support to the on-going process in order to 
accomplish the objectives it set for itself in the country. 
  "Today, when we are walking the final mile and we are about 
to see the results of years of struggle and sacrifice, we owe it 
to ourselves and the people of South Africa not to relax our 
vigilance or allow our enthusiasm to diminish", he said. The 
end of apartheid, Salim stressed, marked not only the closing of 
one of the saddest chapters in the history of Africa, but also 
the beginning of a new challenge of economic cooperation in the 
southern African sub- region and Africa as a whole. "We now need 
to see how the immense potential which exists in South Africa in 
terms of capital, resources and know-how, can interface with 
those found in the rest of the continent, to forge an economic 
partnership which can propel the continent to new heights of 
growth and development". Salim said for Africa to successfully 
monitor the forth-coming South Africa elections, "we need to be 
there, in good time and in sufficient numbers, to support the 
process and to encourage our brothers and sisters". He said 
that concerted action on the part of African countries would 
make a difference similar to the success they achieved during 
the Namibian election. Africa must give some material 
assistance to the liberation movements to enable them compete 
against a government "endowed with almost unlimited resources 
and the advantage of incumbency", he added. The OAU scribe 
urged African states to urgently contribute to the election fund 
established at the OAU summit in Cairo in 1993 to support the 
liberation movements.

<F P=106> [By Damien Ntiranyuhura] </F>
  [Excerpts] Bujumbura, 1 Feb (AFP) -- Gunfire shook parts of 
Burundi's capital Tuesday as ethnic Tutsis and Hutus battled for 
the central African country's leadership in clashes Army sources 
said already left almost 20 dead the previous day. Shooting was 
heard in northern parts of Bujumbura after a further night of 
fighting in the central Nyakabiga district, but no casualty 
figures from that violence could immediately be obtained. 
Opposition supporters put up roadblocks to close off the city 
centre and shops there were shut. Most of the few cars on the 
streets belonged to relief workers. Youths from the Tutsi 
minority, carrying stones, threatened an AFP photographer before 
telling him that the government had pledged a new president 
"representing all Burundis" but had failed to keep its promise. 
  The new trouble began after justice officials on Saturday 
sacked five of the seven members of the constitutional court, 
which had been due to rule on the election of Hutu Agriculture 
Minister Cyprien Ntaryamira as head of state, in place of the 
late Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu who was assassinated in a failed 
coup bid by the Tutsi-dominated Army last October 21. 
  Soldiers were numerous on the streets Tuesday but did not 
intervene when Tutsi youths stoned a young Hutu, the 
photographer said. Ndadaye had been the first elected president 
from the Hutu majority. 
  Military sources said almost a score of people were killed 
in 
clashes on Monday. An opposition coalition on Monday called on 
Burundis to stay away from work until the "restitution of the 
dismissed members of the constitutional court," all of whom were 
Tutsis. The sacked judges themselves issued a statement 
declaring their dismissal unconstitutional and accusing the 
government of "seeking at any cost to prevent the persistent 
risk that the court could invalidate" Ntaryamira's election. 
[passage omitted] 
  Prime Minister Sylvie Kinigi, a Hutu, was Tuesday due to 
meet 
party leaders in a bid to resolve the latest crisis, officials 
said. For weeks after the coup bid, Kinigi went into hiding with 
other government members in foreign missions here as ethnic 
massacres swept across the small highland nation, leaving tens 
of thousands of dead, according to relief workers, and sending 
hundreds of thousands fleeing to neighbouring countries. 
[passage omitted] 
  Former colonial power Belgium expressed "concern" at 
developments in a Foreign Ministry statement issued in Brussels 
on Tuesday. The statement noted that Belgium had backed the 
democratisation process that led to last year's multi-party poll 
and ended traditional Tutsi rule. "The Belgian Government 
considers that everything should be done so that the Government 
of Burundi can restore order and peace and that the political 
obstacles can be raised," the statement said. It expressed 
Belgium's support for Kinigi and for Ntaryamira as "elected 
president," and called on all parties to take part in "national 
reconciliation."

  [Excerpt] The Higher Transitional Council yesterday 
summoned Prime Minister Dr. Kassire Koumakoye to explain how the 
government intends to solve the present economic crisis. The 
prime minister said the government, formed in November 1994, had 
promised to pay salaries in two months, but he admitted that the 
payments had not yet been made. This is why a government-labor 
unions joint commission was set up to ensure harmonious payment 
of salaries throughout the country. Here is Prime Minister 
Koumakoye. 
  [Begin recording] The government and the labor union 
movements have set up a joint commission to find out exactly how 
many months of salaries have been paid. According to the 
reliable information I got from the General Treasury Service, it 
is a bit more than 6 billion CFA francs that have been 
(?disbursed). But which ministries have been paid? Does the 
Treasurey have a right to continue the payments? These are the 
questions that need answers. Do not ask a prime minister to be 
an accountant. To help the public understand what is going on 
in the country, I recently spoke about the poor management of 
our human resources. How can one understand the idea that two 
civil servants working in the same office have been paid 
differently? One received one year's salary arrears, while the 
other received five month's arrears. How can this be possible? 
How can one explain that, in the same prefecture, two civil 
servants from the same service are paid differently? One 
received his salary, while the other did not. These are the 
questions to answer. 
  The government and the labor unions are currently examining 
the issue so that work as well as Chadians can be rationally 
managed. Even if the fruit of Chadians' work is meager, it 
should be fairly shared among them--unless there is none. This 
is the work we are doing with the labor union movements, and I 
think that the staunch advocates of the workers are those who do 
not work well. The [word indistinct] are there, and this 
Chadian is paid 10 months' salary while that one is paid one 
month's. In all, it makes 11 months' salary. What is important 
for us is the amount of salaries paid, and this is what we have 
noted now. The simplest procedure -- I have already examined 
this with the labor unions -- is to issue collective checks, 
which is simple, and to assign each minister to manage his 
personnel. We are discussing this with the labor unions. We 
will solve these problems because we have established a joint 
commission to carry out comprehensive work and because we have 
come here to find the strategy to avoid what we have already 
experienced. It is an issue of common sense. We have come to 
find out together how we can help civil servants avoid further 
misery and help the Chadians avoid pain. I think this is the 
purpose of our meeting. It is in this regard that, on behalf of 
the government, the prime minister announced the government's 
strategy (?calling for) for positive contributions as others 
already did through suggestions [words indistinct]. These are 
the observations that I would like to make. We know one another 
well. The most important issue today is to agree on the way the 
country will be managed and [words indistinct] end up with 
democratic and open elections. [end recording] 
  Concerning the backup measures needed after the devaluation 
of the CFA franc, the prime minister added that in addition to 
the measures of conservation already taken and to be taken by 
the government, taxes will be abolished or reduced. This will 
be carried out within the framework of the Customs and Economic 
Union of Central Africa [UDEAC]. Let us listen to him again: 
  [Begin recording] Measures are being examined; namely, the 
adjustment of prices and taxes so that they can be proportional 
to Chadian's purchasing power and help reactivate economic 
activities and, therefore, all of the nation's activities. The 
document that relates to this issue is (?here) [words 
indistinct], but it should be noted that it is the UDEAC 
taxation code that is in force. We cannot unilaterally revise 
this code without consulting the central African countries, the 
members of the union. Anyway, the government's duty is to take 
conservation measures to protect citizens's purchasing power, 
and we are currently considering such measures. This means that 
we are currently examining the reduction or abolition of some 
taxes, as well as the adjustment of a number of prices. We are 
working on it. Give me time to meet your needs. [end recording]

  [Text] Brazzaville, 31 Jan (PANA)--Members of parliament of 
the Pool region in the the Congolese capital Brazzaville, and 
those representing the three southern regions of the country 
(Bouenza, Niari and Lekoumou), have agreed to a cease-fire to 
end the interethnic clashes that have engulfed Brazzaville since 
December, an official source said. The cease-fire, which began 
midnight Sunday [30 December], is to be backed by the disarming 
of the rival forces and the effective return of people to their 
permanent areas of residence. 
  In a two-day meeting which started Friday, parliamentarians 
agreed to set up a peacekeeping force as recommended by the 
Inter- Regional Committee for Peace, created for the purpose. 
The committee has ordered road blocks removed off the streets 
and also that rail traffic be resumed between Brazzaville and 
Loutete, some 40 kilometres to the south. It has asked 
government to make the public media available to political 
parties. It ordered the closure of private jails and the 
release of all individuals illegally detained. It also said 
schools, universities and all administration offices in the Pool 
region and in the southern districts of Brazzaville (Bacongo, 
Makelekele and Mfilou) must open immediately.

  [Excerpt] The fraudulence of eight of the 58 constituencies 
has been established. The results of these eight constituencies 
have therefore been canceled. In any case, this is the verdict 
handed down at Parliament House this afternoon by the 
international arbitral college appointed to look into the 
electoral dispute. Now more than ever, Congo is taking the path 
of reconciliation to attain durable peace. The salutary 
conclusions reached by the interregional parliamentary committee 
on peace, which met yesterday, is still reverberating in the 
minds of every Congolese. 
  Out of the 58 cases listed for annulment, eight of them were 
judged to be guilty of fraud. The results in these 
constituencies have been annulled. Partial elections are to be 
organized in accordance with existing regulations. The 
following is the list of the constituencies concerned: 
  The second constituency of Bacongo in Brazzaville, the 
second 
constituency of (Mosaka), the second constituency of (Abala), 
the sole constituency of (Toma), the first constituency of 
(Lumumba) in Pointe-Noire, the second constituency of (Deoumi), 
the sole Constituency of (Masholoba), and the first constituency 
of (Ouende) in Brazzaville. 
  Everything is now clear. The results of eight constituencies 
have been annulled. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Brazzaville, 31 Jan (AFP)--Confusion reigned Monday 
[31 January] night over the whether the government of President 
Pascal Lissouba still has a parliamentary majority, after 
contradictory announcements of ballot annulments. Officials 
here said that international mediators had annulled the results 
of eight constituency polls disputed after ballots last year, in 
theory leaving the government's parliamentary majority intact 
with 63 out of 125 seats. But in the Gabonese capital 
Libreville, officials said nine constituency polls had been 
annulled. This would leave his supporters with 62 seats -- one 
less than an overall majority. 
  The polls were among 58 which had been questioned after 
voting which began last May, but which was interrupted following 
widespread unrest, and which was eventually won in October by 
supporters of President Lissouba. Previously the balloting in 
125 constituencies had given 65 seats in the National Assembly 
to pro-Lissouba candidates. 
  The version of annulments announced here ousted two 
pro-Lissouba candidates. The results published in Libreville at 
a ceremony presided over by Gabonese President Omar Bongo ousted 
three. There was no explanation of the contradiction in the 
results. Fresh ballots will be organized in the eight or nine 
disputed constituencies. 
  Observers suggested that the confusion may be due to the 
fact 
that some candidates were the subject of a number of demands 
that their election be annulled. But the situation was unclear 
late Monday. There has been speculation for months that the 
pro-Lissouba coalition could lose its overall majority as a 
result of the findings of the international arbitrating 
committee. 
  The committee comprised seven judges -- two appointed by the 
Organization of African Unity, two by the European Community, 
two by France and one by Gabon -- and was set up under an accord 
signed in Libreville in August. 
  In a statement the arbitrating committee called for calm. 
"We 
have carried out our work in complete independence, so as to 
bring peace back to the country," it said. 
  Amid the confusion, calm appeared to have returned to the 
streets of the Congolese capital Monday, after more than a month 
of unrest between presidential supporters and opposition forces. 
Government forces withdrew from areas south of the city, where 
the opposition has strongholds in the suburbs of Bacongo and 
Makele-Kele. Opposition forces were also not in evidence. 
  Clashes after the first round of voting last year claimed 
some 30 lives. Voting resumed in October after both sides 
agreed to set up the inquiry. But violence flared again in 
November, when around 50 died during fresh bloodshed.

<F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] According to reports from Zaire over the last couple 
of weeks, there has been renewed fighting between rebels and 
government troops in the eastern province of Kivu. It comes at 
a time of continuing tension between the police and local 
people. The government has been meeting to discuss the 
situation and yesterday, they released two statements. (Mossy 
Mwassi) has been monitoring events from Brazzaville in 
neighboring Congo. 
  [Begin recording] The high tension that has been existing in 
Kivu between the gendarmes and civilians last week resulted in 
clashes that left more than 32 soldiers dead and many refugees 
fleeing into Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda. The cabinet meeting 
at the weekend acknowledged that criminality is rampant in 
Zaire. The minister of information, Mr. N'Gongo Luwowo, termed 
the clashes in Kivu Province as regrettable. 
  The confirmed reports say it is the guerrillas fighting to 
overthrow Mobutu who launched the fighting as from last week. 
Reliable information from people who fled Kivu into Congo say 
there has been a lot of intimidation and humiliation carried out 
by the gendarmes against civilians. The gendarmes, while on 
mission, they loot shops and homes, not forgetting violating 
women sexually. The gendarmes have erected roadblocks all over 
the provinces. It is at this roadblock that people are 
humiliated by being searched from head to toe. Many other 
belongings are looted from those who cross this roadblock. In 
the villages, gendarmes carry away goods in the [word 
indistinct]. This has made villagers afraid of the gendarmes. 
Civilians run to hide in the bushes as soon as a Gendarmerie 
vehicle is sighted coming into the village. In October last 
year, the same clashes erupted in Fizi leaving many shops and 
homes looted. The gendarmes carried away televisions, radios, 
and ornaments from persons they encountered on the roads. [end

  [Excerpt] His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi this 
morning at his Harambee House office chaired a meeting of 
cabinet ministers and government officials to review the current 
state of drought and famine in the country and to map out 
strategies needed to meet the crisis. President Moi, at the 
same time, elevated the status of the famine secretariat in the 
Office of the President and created a new department headed by 
an officer at the level of permanent secretary with an 
operational machinery down to the sublocational level. The 
president took the measure in recognition of the magnitude of 
the problems facing the nation and the need for an urgent 
comprehensive management of the problem. The new Department of 
Relief and Rehabilitation in the Office of the President is to 
develop and manage all logistics related to famine relief in the 
country. The department will coordinate all drought recovery 
programs and initiatives in the country including supply of 
seeds, fertilizers, and rehabilitation of boreholes, roads, etc.

  [Excerpts] A Somali National Alliance [SNA] spokesman has 
said that since the SNA called for a cease-fire at the beginning 
of October 1993, the U.S. and UN Operation in Somalia [UNOSOM] 
forces have shot and killed about 60 people and injured more 
than double that number. The victims include women--some of 
them pregnant, children, and the elderly. All of them were 
unarmed. The most recent of these savage acts was carried out 
by the U.S. forces at about 0500 this morning, 31 January 1994, 
near Kilometre Four in Mogadishu, when a U.S. armored personnel 
carrier opened fire on civilians, some of whom were collecting 
food from the Saudi agency. Some were walking along the street, 
and others were going about their business. Eyewitnesses said 
that the dead and injured number more than 30 people. [passage 
omitted] 
  The report added that the number of deaths confirmed so far 
is 17, with 13 injured. It was also reported that most of the 
dead bodies were taken to houses. A spokesman called on the 
Somali people to make known the number of those wounded and the 
number of the dead who had been taken home. 
  He said that it is unfortunate that while the SNA was 
striving to strengthen the cease-fire and keep away from 
anything that would cause a confrontation, the foreign troops, 
especially those of the United States, were engaged in a 
massacre of the Somali people that can be seen as a continuation 
of their enmity and revenge on the Somali people. The SNA was 
expecting to heal the wounds of the past and has complained 
strongly to the U.S. Government about the problems its troops 
are inflicting on the Somali people. We ask for an explanation 
why the U.S. forces are not observing the cease-fire and prefer 
to continue with their enmity against Somali people. 
  Finally, the SNA spokesman called on the Somali people to 
exercise tolerance and calm and called on foreign troops to stop 
the unjust massacre they are carrying out against the Somali 
people.

  [Excerpt] As you have heard, no work was done today in 
Bujumbura town. Streets have been closed off since this 
morning, and tension has prevailed in the suburbs. We do not 
know everything that has been damaged, but it has been said that 
houses have been burned in Musaga. For this reason, the 
secretary of state for security and the interim minister for 
territorial administration and communal development, Lieutenant 
Colonel Gakoryo Lazare, gave the following address on today's 
events. 
  [Begin Gakoryo recording] Today, 31 January, the peace was 
disturbed in Bujumbura because of roadblocks preventing people 
from reporting to work and going to the markets and preventing 
shops from opening. Yesterday evening, leaflets telling people 
not to work were distributed in bars and houses. Very early 
this morning, youths began to erect roadblocks on some Bujumbura 
streets, especially in Ngagara, Musaga, Kinanira, and Kanyosha. 
  This has led to the following problems: Work has come to a 
halt, in both the government and private sector; markets were 
not well attended, therefore most families did not buy goods; 
almost all vehicles were at a halt, especially in the morning, 
so very few people could move from one area to another and the 
sick could not be taken to hospital; ethnic tension erupted, 
especially in the zones of Musaga and Kinanira. 
  But peace is slowly returning this evening. Extensive damage 
has been reported. Some houses were either demolished or burned 
in Musaga and Kinanira. Goods were looted due to the tension 
that prevailed in the aforementioned suburbs. There are reports 
of deaths and injuries. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] This round of the Lusaka peace talks has finally 
taken a step forward. After several weeks of intense 
discussions, the future national police issue was finally 
wrapped up today. Now the issue of national reconciliation will 
be on the negotiating table, and it is believed to be an equally 
tough assignment. Pedro Manuel, our special correspondent in 
the Zambian capital, provides the details: 
  [Begin Pedro recording] This round of the Lusaka peace talks 
has taken yet another step forward. The negotiators have put an 
end to discussions concerning the future national police force 
issue. It is not known how responsibilities were apportioned, 
but [words indistinct] last weekend, according to rumors the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] had 
lowered its demands to participate with 40 percent of the Public 
Order Police force and 50 percent of the Rapid Intervention 
Police force. It has reduced its demands to a general [figure 
indistinct] percent. This report has not been confirmed by any 
source whatever so far. 
  Another as yet unconfirmed report says that UNITA is to have 
5,500 men in the future national police force. 
  With the shelving of the future national police dossier, the 
negotiators began discussing national reconciliation this 
afternoon. Observers believe this will be one (?of the most 
difficult) hurdles to overcome at this round of talks. This 
part of the talks will discuss the possibility that UNITA will 
also participate in government. In other words, it will focus 
on what ministerial portfolios the government can award UNITA. 
As is already known, UNITA wants some portfolios for itself 
that, according to some analysts, would put in a position where 
it would be sharing power. We are talking about its requests for 
the defense, information, foreign affairs, economy and finance, 
and territorial administration portfolios. 
  As of this afternoon, the talks will focus on national 
reconciliation and the negotiators will also have to discuss the 
mandate of the UN Angola Verification Mission-2, Unavem-2. That 
is an issue that [words indistinct] meanwhile, UN Special 
Representative Alioune Blondin Beye is to go to Cote d'Ivoire on 
2 February to attend the funeral ceremony honoring the late 
President Felix Houphouet-Boigny. 
  In Lusaka, the talks will continue under the chairmanship of 
Nigerian General Garuba [words indistinct] of Unavem. [end

  [Text] Pretoria Jan 31 SAPA -- Trilateral talks involving 
government, the African National Congress [ANC] and the Freedom 
Alliance [FA] ground to a halt on Monday [31 January] night. 
Negotiators for the three parties emerged after little more than 
an hour of talks, saying there had been no movement on key 
constitutional and electoral issues. 
  The breakdown could mean a boycott of the April poll by the 
Freedom Alliance's major component, the Inkatha Freedom Party 
[IFP], as well as the Afrikaner rightwing. 
  Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer said the 
election would in all likelihood be promulgated on Wednesday, 
allowing two days for the resolution of differences. 
Negotiators, however, felt this was unlikely and a general mood 
of despondency characterised the talks breakdown. 
  Monday night's meeting came up against two issues which the 
ANC said were non-negotiable. These were the single ballot 
system for the April election and complete autonomy for regional 
constitutions. The ANC's National Executive Committee is due to 
meet on Tuesday to discuss a package put to the meeting by the 
alliance. 
  IFP Central Committee member Walter Felgate said there was 
little chance of a breakthrough. He said ANC Secretary General 
Cyril Ramaphosa had said during the meeting that he thought 
there was a slim chance of changes leading to a multi-party 
settlement. 
  Mr Felgate said the FA would await the ANC's response to its 
package. 
  Mr Meyer said the election would go ahead without those 
parties who wanted to boycott it. He said government was 
satisfied it had moved sufficiently over the last 10 days. "The 
ANC and the Freedom Alliance can't find each other. Unless they 
change their positions in the next 48 hours, there's not going 
to be much progress on the way forward." 
  He said government believed the issues could still be 
resolved. Mr Meyer added government was satisfied with the 
constitution and satisfied it had met the demands of the 
alliance. For this reason, the election could go ahead, he said. 
  Mr Meyer noted it was important all parties participate in 
the election with a view to gaining support for their ideas. 
"There is no way they can play a role if they do not take part 
in the election." 
  Monday night's talks took place after a weekend in which 
both 
the IFP and the Afrikaner Volksfront [AVF, Afrikaner National 
Front] militantly rejected participation in elections. The 
Monday night meeting was considered a final attempt to reach 
agreement after three previous meetings the week before had 
failed to bring the parties closer.

  [Text] Negotiators in Lusaka will no longer discuss the 
issue of national police today. The dossier on police, which 
was the first point on the agenda on political issues, was 
concluded yesterday at the end of [words indistinct]. The two 
delegations agreed on the composition of the new corporation and 
its judicial facet, as well as the modes of its formation. Now 
that the police issue has been concluded, there is hope that 
Angola will at last have a police force that serves the people. 
When the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola 
[UNITA] and the government meet again in Lusaka today, they will 
discuss national reconciliation. This very extensive issue may 
take some time for a consensus to be reached, but, as stated by 
a diplomatic source linked to UNITA, the Angolans will have to 
be reconciled. The Angolan peace talks began in November 1993 
under the mediation of Malian national Alioune Blondin Beye, 
special representative of the UN secretary general in Angola, 
and in the presence of the troika of observers, with the United 
States and Portugal playing a decisive role. Russia's position 
is ambiguous and partial since it is still supplying the Popular 
Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party with arms for 
war. Angolans hope that the sides will reach a general peace 
accord as soon as possible so that they may reconstruct their 
country.

<F P=106> [Interview with Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama by DOMINGO </F>
reporter Almiro Santos; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Santos] Mr. President, you speak of an economic and 
social council. What do you have in mind exactly? 
  [Dhlakama] We are experiencing a very serious problem. 
Although it is I alone, as leader of the Mozambique National 
Resistance [Renamo], who is raising this question, I think that 
the Mozambican people and other opposition leaders support my 
view because it is right. 
  In August last year, I drew up a small blueprint with a view 
to creating something to be known as the Economic and Social 
Council. 
  [Santos] Basically, what is the Economic and Social Council? 
  [Dhlakama] It would be a small body made up of members from 
Renamo, the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo], and unarmed 
opposition parties. What was my idea? It was aimed at freeing 
my brother Joaquim Chissano from criticism. He and his 
government have been accused of corruption and diverting state 
funds. Frelimo cannot prove that it is not doing it. That is 
why I proposed this council. 
  [Santos] What was President Chissano's reaction? 
  [Dhlakama] He went to the extent of saying that that would 
be 
a coup d'etat. I said it would not. I told him that I was 
suggesting the creation of the council not because Renamo signed 
the General Peace Accord, but because we are part of the 
opposition and we are presently in a transition period. My 
concern at this moment, as leader of the opposition, is to be 
truly sure that the Mozambican Government is not misusing state 
funds. 
  No one can assure me now and say: Look, Dhlakama, remain 
calm. That is not happening. Can anyone say that what I am 
saying is political propaganda? No, it is not. I think it is 
now clear why the government does not want to approve such a 
council. That is why, in my electoral campaign, I want to 
accuse the Frelimo government of diverting state funds and 
misusing state vehicles. The state and the party are not one 
and the same thing, but party members here receive state 
vehicles. 
  What is happening in Mozambique today is exactly the 
opposite 
of what is happening in other countries. In other countries, 
state vehicles have their own registration number, but here no 
one knows which are state vehicles and which ones are not. 
  [Santos] Very soon, state vehicles will bear the word 
"state". 
  [Dhlakam] Yes, the government is going to do that, but I do 
not know when. In the meantime, they are using the vehicles and 
will continue to use them. They are violating government rules. 
It is not only vehicles; there is also the question of money. 
For example, I do not know how many billions and billions of 
meticals are in our banks. I also do not know how many billions 
of meticals the government is withdrawing daily from these banks 
to sustain its policy. 
  Now, how can President Chissano assure me saying: Look, my 
brother Dhlakama, that is not happening. He cannot. I want him 
to tell me: Dhlakama, you are lying, because we are not 
misusing state money and we are not diverting investment funds. 
Here is the proof. 
  That is why I continue to demand the creation of an economic 
and state council or a body with any other name. It could, for 
example, be called an economic commission. What I want is that 
this body should be able to control us and assure us. 
  [Santos] What is your fear? 
  [Dhlakama] My fear is: I belong to the opposition. It is 
not because I do not have money. Even if I had billions and 
billions of dollars, I would not allow a party to use state 
funds. People can say that I am saying this because Renamo does 
not have money. That is not the case. Even in the United 
States or any other country, no opposition party would allow the 
government to misuse state funds. That is a the rule. Here in 
Mozambique, people do not understand. They think Dhlakama is 
raising this issue because his party does not have money. They 
want benefits. That is not the case. We do not even want to 
rule with the government. What we want is to end this misuse of 
funds and vehicles. 
  President Chissano says he is working for democracy. He says 
he is making changes to usher in democracy. He is not telling 
the truth because a democrat is open. He puts the cards on the 
table and says: Look, I am not corrupt. I do not do what you 
say I do, and here is the proof. Or he may say: I was in the 
wrong, but now I have stopped doing that. 
  Unfortunately, Chissano cannot say this. He is still 
creating conditions for me to continue to point an accusing 
finger at him. I like President Chissano very much. He is a 
very good friend of mine. We signed the General Peace Accord 
together, but there are things that he does not accept. It is 
not because he does not want to. 
  [Santos] What is the reason then? 
  [Dhlakama] I understand. The Frelimo Party is a very heavy 
machinery. It has about 100 orthodox Marxists who do not 
believe in democracy. I continue to insist the government 
should create this opening, because we are in a transition 
period and we are going to hold elections this October. I fear 
that the government may be using state funds to buy vehicles, 
bicycles, motorcycles, flags, and pamphlets for its political 
propaganda. 
  [Santos] Does the Renamo president have proof or not? 
  [Dhlakam] It is not a question of proof. As an opposition 
leader, I have to be concerned with the government's actions. I 
shall only stop to criticize the government when President 
Chissano says: Afonso Dhlakama was wrong. Let us investigate. 
As long as he does not do that, I shall continue to criticize 
the government, with proof or no proof. I want him to tell me 
that I am not saying the truth. Then, a commission should be 
created which will contact bank managers, even the president 
himself, to prove that the Frelimo Party is not using state 
funds. 
  [Santos] This commission you are proposing would more or 
less 
be a body to inspect government activities? 
  [Dhlakama] My brother, I would not exactly put it that way. 
Now that we are in a transition period, this council would work 
to control all funds. For example, let us suppose that even 
today Great Britain announces that it is going to give 
Mozambique $25 million for economic rehabilitation. It will be 
giving that money to the Mozambican state and not the party. It 
will be giving this money to be used for economic 
reconstruction, to rehabilitate towns, and so on. Who is going 
to tell me that that money will not be diverted from 
rehabilitation projects that would benefit the people and be 
used to buy vehicles for the Frelimo Party? 
  [Santos] Don't donors try to ensure that the money they give 
is used correctly? Do they not investigate? 
  [Dhlakama] It is somehow difficult. We have many instances 
where money has been misused. I am a Mozambican and was in the 
bush for 16 years. Donors themselves know that even if they do 
investigate, they cannot do it fully. What's more, it is not 
only a question of controlling foreign investments in 
Mozambique. There is a need also to control our own money. 
  I belong to the opposition. I do not know how many billions 
of meticals are in our banks. I want to know. It is not 
because I want that money. I just want to know how many 
billions of meticals we have. I fear that the Frelimo Party may 
be misusing that money. If the government says Dhlakama has no 
right to know, then that is not democracy because they can 
misuse this money whenever they want. There is no democratic 
country worldwide where opposition concerns are not satisfied. 
  [Santos] You are, therefore, accusing the government? 
  [Dhlakama] I am not accusing Frelimo of stealing money. I am 
only demanding that Frelimo should stop misusing funds if it has 
been doing so in the past. For it to stop, we should create 
mechanisms, such as an economic and social council. 
  [Santos] Your main concern now is to establish this control 
mechanism? 
  [Dhlakama] Yes, that is my concern. I do not know how many 
billions of meticals the state is getting daily through taxes, 
import and export tariffs. Who is controlling this money? 
Where is it? The Mozambican Government should be accountable 
to Parliament, but it is not saying anything. The Assembly of 
the Republic belongs to Frelimo. That is my concern. 
  What is more, we have thousands and thousands of houses. You 
know that with independence, houses were nationalized, and 
although the rents are not high, but taking into account that in 
all houses throughout the country people must pay rent, the 
Administration of State-Owned Buildings is receiving billions 
and billions of meticals monthly. Where is this money and how 
is it being used? All these houses belong to the state. 
  [Santos] With regard to vehicles, do you have proof that 
they 
are being bought with state money to be distributed to Frelimo 
members? 
  [Dhlakama] The government is distributing new vehicles. 
People, like directors, state officials, Frelimo Central 
Committee members, who did not have cars before the signing of 
the General Peace Accord, now have Land Rovers and Mercedes 
Benz. If we total these vehicles, there are hundreds and 
hundreds of them, costing billions of meticals and millions of 
dollars. 
  Where is Frelimo getting this money? Is it really getting 
this money from its funds as a party? If that is the case, 
then, let it prove it. That is not all. With independence, 
companies were nationalized and most of these companies belong 
to the state. These companies are making money. Who is 
calculating these companies' profits and in what projects is 
this money being used? If it is in the bank, who knows how much 
it is? 
  Vehicles continue to be bought. They continue to be 
distributed. Frelimo has already ordered more than 600,000 
bicycles and motorcycles for its political propaganda. 
  [Santos] You could be confusing this with what the 
government 
is ordering for the electoral process. The government has the 
responsibility to organize the electoral process. Do you not 
think all these bicycles and motorcycles were ordered so that 
they can be used by the electoral commissions? 
  [Dhlakama] No, no. All these things are not for the 
government to organize the electoral process. They are meant 
for the Frelimo Party itself. 
  [Santos] For the electoral campaign? 
  [Dhlakama] Yes, for Frelimo's electoral campaign. That is 
why, I am talking about bicycles, motorcycles, and money here. 
This has nothing to do with the National Elections Commission 
[CNE]. The fund for the CNE's operation comes from donations 
from the international community. I, as the leader of the 
opposition, have a representative in this body. My concern is 
to know where Frelimo gets its money. 
  [Santos] Perhaps from its companies.... 
  [Dhlakama] I agree that any party can have its companies. 
Frelimo has members who already have their own private 
companies. We have nothing to do with that. If there is a 
minister who has a company and gives his profits to the Frelimo 
Party, we have no problem with that. We are also going to do 
that. So that is not what we are talking about. We are talking 
about all these buildings that we have. For example, the Rovuma 
Hotel gets thousands and thousands of dollars each month. We 
hear that the hotel belongs to the Frelimo Party. How is that 
possible? How did the Frelimo Party buy it? From whom and 
when? All we know is that all the hotels in the country were 
nationalized. 
  [Santos] But your concern, Mr. President, are the thousands 
of dollars from the UN Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz] that 
end up in Frelimo coffers? 
  [Dhlakama] If we count all the months that have passed, we 
shall see that thousands and thousands of Unomoz dollars have 
ended up in Frelimo coffers. 
  [Santos] Now, you do not believe that the Rovuma Hotel 
belongs to Frelimo Party? 
  [Dhlakama] I do not believe that it belongs to Frelimo, 
because I know that it is one of the hotels that was 
nationalized by the state. Now when the government says that 
this or that belongs to the Frelimo Party, that raises 
questions: When did the party buy it? Who received the money, 
to confirm that the Frelimo Party has truly bought it? There 
are many questions that we can raise. My concern is that the 
Frelimo Party should stop using state funds. If it wants to 
continue using state funds, then these funds should be divided 
among the parties -- the Frelimo Party, Renamo, and all other 
opposition parties. The Frelimo Party is not the state. It is 
just a party. 
  [Santos] Is this situation the result of the single-party 
system that existed in the country, where the party was confused 
with the state? 
  [Dhlakama] That could be the case, but Frelimo now is 
grabbing everything. 
  [Santos] Everything? 
  [Dhlakama] Yes, everything. For example, now there is 
confusion. We do not know what belongs to the state and what 
belongs to Frelimo. Houses were nationalized in favor of the 
state. Now, we see Frelimo ministers privatizing them among 
themselves. Everyone knows this. Frelimo knows that with a 
multiparty national assembly, everything must be made clear. 
What are they doing? They are grabbing everything, and this 
worries me. 
  Things here are privatized among Frelimo party officials. 
For example, they say that they want to sell a state building 
for 3 billion meticals. A common citizen cannot even get 10 
million meticals. This is only meant to deceive people. 
Someone could win the bid, but where is he going to get 3 
billion meticals? 
  [Santos] He can go to the bank.... 
  [Dhlakama] He will keep going to the bank for three or four 
days without getting any money. Then they will tell him the 
deadline is over. Since you have no money, you cannot buy the 
building. But when it is a Frelimo official, it is just a 
matter of lifting the telephone and calling the bank. He does 
not even need to withdraw the money. He will just fill the 
forms, and then register as having bought the building. That is 
not democracy. 
  [Santos] It is corruption? 
  [Dhlakama] It is not even corruption. It is not. It is 
disorganization and total disrespect for the Mozambican people. 
  [Santos] And opportunism? 
  [Dhlakama] They want to take advantage of everything. They 
continue to take advantage. I think this is to deny our people 
democracy. They fear democracy, because a person who does not 
fear democracy creates conditions for others to operate. 
  For example, we were all against "apartheid" in South 
Africa, 
but our black brother Mandela, African National Congress [ANC] 
president, is now participating. 
  [Santos] In the case of Mozambique, the participation that 
you are referring to, would be a transitional government? 
  [Dhlakama] Mandela is not in a transitional government. He 
does not have ministers in the white government, but a mechanism 
has been created to control everything. Today, the white 
government can no longer use 20 rands from the state funds 
without the ANC saying yes. When Mandela makes this demand, it 
is not because he does not trust the white government. This is 
what it should be in democracy. He does not want the white 
government to use state funds, and the entire international 
community supports Mandela's stand. Why is my stand not also 
supported? Is the South African democracy different from ours? 
  [Santos] Regarding the creation of an Economic and Social 
Council, does the president of the republic continue to think 
that it is a coup d'etat? 
  [Dhlakama] Now, I do not know. I raised this issue one week 
ago, and yesterday (Friday) I read in the newspaper that he is 
out of the country. That was his reply at that time. 
  [Santos] You mean last August? 
  [Dhlakama] Yes, last year. He told me in a conversation, as 
a brother, that that would be a coup d'etat. I said: No, Mr. 
President, it is not. That is democracy. You are being 
criticized and how can you tell the people not to criticize you? 
  I even said to him: I am insisting on this to save your 
image, Mr. President. 
  [Santos] You mean the Renamo president wanted to save the 
image of the president of the Republic? 
  [Dhlakama] Yes, certainly, that is what I want, because I am 
always criticizing him. When will this bad image then disappear 
from the people's minds? Only when he says that he is tired of 
being accused of doing something that is not true. 
  [Santos] But of what do you accuse him exactly? 
  [Dhlakama] I say his government is using state funds. When 
he says that he is tired of being accused of doing something 
that he is not doing, then a commission should be created, made 
up of some economists from Renamo and the opposition. This 
commission will go to the bank and see the figures, it will see 
the state vehicles and then say: "Look, we are not using these 
vehicles for political campaign. We are using them as state 
vehicles." 
  I agree that an administrator needs to have a Land Rover, as 
a state official, but I do not agree that a Frelimo Party first 
secretary in a district should move about saying: Long live 
Frelimo. I mean.... 
  [Santos] Is it not the same thing for a Frelimo Party first 
secretary to have a vehicle and a Renamo provincial delegate to 
also have a vehicle and move about.... 
  [Dhlakama] That is not the case. It is only now that Renamo 
is trying to buy vehicles. There are not even 20 vehicles. Our 
delegates move about on foot because we do not have vehicles for 
them to visit districts. We now want to buy vehicles for the 
party. 
  [Santos] But are there Renamo delegates with vehicles? 
  [Dhlakama] It is possible that there are delegates with 
vehicles, but the vehicles are identified as theirs. If there 
is a Frelimo secretary who has bought a vehicle with his own 
money, we have no problem with that. What we know up to now is 
that all Frelimo Party officials use state vehicles. That is 
why the government does not even want to come up with a 
registration number to identify these vehicles as state vehicles. 
  [Santos] In brief, this concern is because of elections. Do 
you think elections will still be held in the country this 
October? 
  [Dhlakama] My concern is not only because of elections. This 
concern was presented last August. The cease-fire came into 
force in 1992. I was waiting to come to Maputo to present this 
concern. I could not do it from Maringue. When I came here for 
the first time, I presented my concern. Answering the last part 
of your question, I believe we shall have elections in 1994. 
  [Santos] Even with delays in confining troops? 
  [Dhlakama] It is true that the confinement process is behind 
schedule, but it is Frelimo that is delaying the confinement 
process. It does not want to confine its troops. 
  [Santos] What is the reason? Do you have any explanation? 
  [Dhlakama] Since I do not belong to Frelimo, I do not know 
the true reason behind this behavior, but I believe it is 
because of disorganization in the army. I do not want to make a 
serious accusation that Frelimo may be preparing another war, 
because it does not possess the capacity to do it. A Mozambican 
Army does not exist now. It does not exist. All that Frelimo 
has are men with weapons. There are thousands of men with 
weapons, military ranks, and so on. But an army, as an organ, 
does not exist. 
  I know that Minister Chipande does not know where his troops 
are. I know that the chief of the General Staff does not know 
where his troops are. Army Chief Tobias Dai does not know where 
troops are. 
  Military commanders live in apartments with their families 
while soldiers are scattered. 
  [Santos] That means therefore that the problem of delay in 
confining troops is not a political problem? 
  [Dhlakama] First, I am saying that it is a problem of 
disorganization. Who gives orders to whom? Who begins to give 
orders? For example, President Chissano, who is the commander 
in chief of the Armed Forces, gives orders to whom? Does he 
give orders to the defense minister, the army commander, or the 
chief of the General Staff? These in turn, give orders to whom? 
To the provincial commanders. But where are they? They live 
in apartments while the troops are in barracks.

  [Text] Afonso Dhlakama, Mozambique National Resistance 
[Renamo] leader, has proposed the formation of the Social and 
Economic Council with the mission of controlling the use of 
state funds. He alleged that the Mozambique Liberation Front 
[Frelimo] is using government property for its electoral 
campaign. Meanwhile, the government says that that matter was 
set aside following a meeting between President Joaquim Chissano 
and Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama in August of last year. 
  The Renamo leader, who said that he had already put that 
proposal to the Mozambican head of state when they met in Maputo 
in August last year, added that President Joaquim Chissano had 
rejected it. 
  Dhlakama says that as of now he intends to start "drawing as 
much attention as possible to that matter, so that a commission 
can be created that will control the funds. In other words, 
that would allow at least the Renamo Party to know what is 
happening in the Mozambican banks and how much money is coming 
into this country. Let us suppose, for instance, that the United 
States gives Frelimo some $8 million to $20 million for national 
reconstruction purposes, but who is to know whether Frelimo will 
be using it for its own electoral campaign?" 
  President Joaquim Chissano noted that issue had been 
"brushed 
aside the moment it was raised by Mr. Dhlakama. We had even 
agreed we would not talk about the subject. It appeared to me 
that Mr. Dhlakama saw it as an unreasonable point that had not 
been properly thought out by those Renamo officials who may have 
proposed it." 
  In turn, Dhlakama says that it is necessary that "people be 
certain that Frelimo is not using state funds at this stage for 
its own campaign." 
  The Renamo leader further noted that the proposed Social and 
Economic Council could include representatives from other 
Mozambican political forces, even though those parties had not 
been signatories to the General Peace Accord in Rome. 
Nonetheless, he said: "We believe that they are Mozambican 
political parties and that they also need to be informed about 
this whole transition process, because they will also take part 
in the upcoming elections." 
  We asked the Renamo leader: So, are you proposing a 
government of national unity? To which he replied: "No, no, 
because a transitional government or a government of national 
unity would contravene the General Peace Accord. It would also 
be confusing because it would necessitate discussions on 
ministerial posts and other such matters." 
  From his point of view, the Social and Economic Council "has 
nothing to do with the General Peace Accord. What happens is 
that everyone knows the country is going through a process of 
transition and even Frelimo itself is going through a 
transition. In other words, the Assembly of the Republic will 
no longer be led by one party. It will be a multiparty 
organization once elections have been held. Taking into 
consideration the fact that Frelimo ruled the country alone and 
that even nationalized houses and hotels are today viewed as the 
property of the Frelimo Party -- though no one knows where or 
who they bought them from; but today they are occupied by UN 
guests who pay in dollars and that money is going directly to 
the Frelimo Party." 
  Afonso Dhlakama also noted that the proposal for the 
creation 
of the aforesaid council will be presented to the government 
again quite soon "because in August I had a small plan that was 
conveyed to President Chissano and which he flatly rejected. He 
went so far as to say that it was a blow against the Frelimo 
government." Copies of the plan were distributed among foreign 
ambassadors accredited in Mozambique but, as the Renamo leader 
himself has said, diplomats have not reacted to that document. 
  Dhlakama further affirmed that "I shall really continue this 
struggle...I shall only rest when I begin to know how much money 
is in Frelimo's bank and how it is being used. There are many 
cars, motorcycles, bicycles, millions upon millions of radio 
sets, spare parts, dresses, pants, and so forth being bought to 
be given to the people during the electoral campaign and those 
are things that cost millions of dollars." 
  We noted, though, that perhaps all that is being bought with 
the Frelimo Party money, to which the Renamo leader replied: 
"That is fine, but let Frelimo then say where it gets its 
money." We insisted that Renamo does not disclose the source of 
its funds either. "Everybody knows that Renamo is poor", Afonso 
Dhlakama responded. 
  The Renamo leader said: "We are not going to investigate 
whether there is a factory, whether a Frelimo member has a 
plantation, or whether he sells corn to finance his party's 
campaign, but that Social and Economic Council would see how 
state money is being used."

<F P=106> [Interview with Mozambique Armed Forces General Domingos </F>
Fondo by reporter Almiro Santos; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Domingos Fondo is the general everyone is talking 
about. He was curt, perhaps "abrupt." He spoke only a few words 
to say what went on in his mind. "I shall not grant any more 
interviews for as long as Dhlakama does not prove my involvement 
in arms smuggling," he said. 
  That was all. The person who caused the storm was Afonso 
Dhlakama, the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] leader, 
who accused General Fondo of being involved in smuggling weapons 
to South Africa. 
  Gen. Fondo will not be taking Dhlakama to court on charges 
of 
defamation. The general is not worried. The general is waiting 
for the Renamo leader to prove that he is guilty. The family of 
the general is not angry. The general got to know Dhlakama when 
the latter was a "logistics soldier." What the general wants to 
know about is national reconciliation and he wants "to taste the 
fruit of the national liberation armed struggle." 
  The rest is up to the Renamo leader: let him prove it. 
  Until he does so, this will be Gen. Domingos Fondo's last 
interview. 
  [Santos] Gen. Fondo: you have been the commander of the 
border security troops for nearly four years. During that 
period did you detect any signs of arms smuggling to South 
Africa? 
  [Fondo] Well, I thought you might have wanted to begin by 
asking what I had done during the national liberation armed 
struggle. Where you want to begin only reflects half of the 
work I have done. 
  As for your question, I must tell you that there were not 
just signs of arms smuggling to and from South Africa. There 
was also the smuggling of vehicles and strategic export products 
such as cashews, rosewood, sandalwood and so forth. In other 
words, all those products that a person carries and illegally 
takes to another country. There were also persons who were 
caught illegally crossing both sides of the border. 
  When we talk about South Africa, we talk about an area that 
begins up in Pafuri.... 
  [Santos] But how did the border security troops deal with 
those cases of smuggling and with the smugglers? 
  [Fondo] Seeing that it was not up to us to judge -- we were 
there only to ensure that the law was observed -- those persons 
were taken to the police and to court. Obviously, first we 
asked some small questions, we tried to establish who was 
driving the vehicle, whether the hidden goods belonged to him, 
and so on, after which that person would be taken to the 
authorities with jurisdiction, notably the police. Thus, the 
case had been opened and, from that point onward, it was left in 
the hands of the courts. We were not informed about the 
evolution of the case because it was no longer our concern, at 
least until the border security forces were disbanded. 
  [Santos] How many cases were detected at the time? 
  [Fondo] I believe that the public and the journalists had 
the 
opportunity to follow the cases that were discovered. It was 
not just South Africa. It was also Swaziland. Weapons are the 
prime concern of the bilateral security commission. Those 
weapons are not taken to the countries by the persons that will 
use them.... 
  [Santos] They are taken by persons who want to score some 
money, is that right? 
  [Fondo] That is right: Those weapons are taken by persons 
who 
are interested in making money. They smuggle any kind of 
merchandise. 
  [Santos] A documentary was run at one time that depicted the 
alleged killing of elephants in Renamo-controlled areas so that 
ivory could be exchanged for weapons. General, did you come 
across any such case while you were commander of the border 
security forces? 
  [Fondo] No, I never discovered such a thing. 
<H5>  Absolutely Nothing </H5>
  [Santos] After that accusation by the Renamo president, have 
you, General, been asked by any institution to make a statement? 
Are you facing any inquiry at this point? 
  [Fondo] I must tell you that I have nothing, really 
absolutely nothing to answer in connection with that matter. 
Perhaps the person who reported it has something to tell some 
institution. I do not. 
  [Santos] That means, then, that you are at peace with 
yourself... 
  [Fondo] Absolutely. 
  [Santos] But, in your opinion, General, what may have been 
the reason for those accusations by the Renamo president? 
  [Fondo] I do not know. I cannot say what the reason may have 
been. It is pretty much like when a person wants to buy a 
shirt: I cannot say why a person would want to buy a particular 
shirt. It is not I who must respond to that question. He is 
the one who must answer it. 
  [Santos] General: Do you know Mr. Afonso Dhlakama? 
  [Fondo] Yes, I do. We worked together at one time. 
  [Santos] Within the Frelimo Party? 
  [Fondo] Yes, within the Frelimo Party. He worked and he was 
in Frelimo them. 
  [Santos] He came in 1973.... 
  [Fondo] That concerns the Personnel Department. 
  [Santos] But what was he working as, when you got to know 
him? 
  [Fondo] He was working in the logistics department. He was a 
logistics soldier. 
  [Santos] In Beira? 
  [Fondo] Yes, in Beira. 
  [Santos] General, did you have any problems in your 
relationship with Afonso Dhlakama at the time? 
  [Fondo] If memory does not fail me, I was in Cabo Delgado 
Province at the time and I was provincial military commander. 
  [Santos] The president of the Republic has told our 
newspaper 
that your name never cropped up at meetings he has had with the 
Renmao leader. Would you care to comment? 
  [Fondo] I have no comment to make. 
  [Santos] At the news conference which you held, you said: 
"He 
will pay." Exactly what did you mean by that? 
  [Fondo] The meaning is clear, when I say "he will pay." It 
is very clear. He will pay because he is the person who is 
worried. He will pay. Whom will he pay? He will pay the 
public, because he must inform the public on the basis of 
concrete evidence. That is what pay means: he must explain to 
the public exctaly what such and such a thing means. 
  For instance, right now I am the one who is paying. I should 
not be asked such questions. I am paying for Dhlakama's worries. 
  There is one other thing I would like to say: journalists 
and 
reporters are constantly around me. I would like to inform you, 
the journalists, here and now, that until such a time as Mr. 
Dhlakama confirms his accusations, I do not want, I do not want, 
and I strongly emphasize that I do not want you, the 
journalists, to ask me any more questions in connection with 
that matter. Go to the person who has the details and ask him. 
You are just wasting my time. 
<H5>  The General's Affairs </H5>
  [Santos] Perhaps we can ask other questions. Can we, for 
instance, talk about your businesses? 
  [Fondo] We can. 
  [Santos] May we begin with your companies? 
  [Fondo] As a matter of principle, I am a person who does not 
like to talk much. If there are people who are worried, those 
people should go to the places where I have my interests as a 
citizen. I have farms.... 
  [Santos] Here in Maputo? 
  [Fondo] Yes, here in Maputo. 
  [Santos] Are they far? 
  [Fondo] No, they are not far. I have a farm here at Pequenos 
Libombos. I have another farm in Corumana. I have workers 
there, and they are working even though I am not there. Just go 
there and you will get the answers you are looking for. 
  If you do not know me, you can get to know me now. Fondo is 
a Mozambican citizen. What is his background, though? Just go 
directly to the area of Fondo, in Zavala District, Inhambane 
Province. You will see the area of Fondo on the map. Just go 
there and see for yourselves the work that this man Fondo is 
doing with the property he inherited from his grandparents, his 
parents, and so on. You will see that, after all Fondo does all 
this work when he comes here, when he is here on leave, and as 
the inheritor of this farm. 
  You are going to learn all that. Now, there is no point in 
asking me about that here in the city, because I may give you 
the wrong answer and you may turn around and say that, no, this 
was not what you wanted to know. Just go out there and you 
shall find answers to your concerns. 
<H5>  On The Attack Again </H5>
  [Santos] Do you really think, General, that there are 
Mozambique Armed Forces, FAM, soldiers involved in arms 
smuggling practices? 
  [Fondo] I might also ask you: is this an accusation against 
the FAM forces? 
  [Santos] No, it is no accusation. 
  [Fondo] Well, then, drop the question. 
  [Santos] It is just that many people have been saying 
that... 
  [Fondo] I would like to insist that if this is an accusation 
against the FAM forces, I will show where it is. [sentence as 
heard] 
  [Santos] No, obviously it is not an accusation. 
  [Fondo] That settles it, then. 
  [Santos] I would just like to know your stand on this 
matter. 
  [Fondo] I have no opinion on it. You must tell me, though, 
whether this is an accusation against the FAM forces. 
  [Santos] No, it is not. General, will you be suing the 
Renamo 
president on grounds of defamation? 
  [Fondo] I do not believe I should be the one to answer that 
question. As I have said before, he is the one who must produce 
proof. 
  [Santos] So General, you are waiting for the Renamo leader 
to 
prove his charges? 
  [Fondo] Yes. It is not up to me to prove them. The onus is 
on him. 
  [Santos] General, will you not take the matter to court? 
  [Fondo] No. Even my children are cracking jokes. They went 
to "Chope" and they are calm. Tomorrow, others will go to 
Zavala. They are all calm, and they will be traveling by bus. 
  [Santos] What about your colleagues? Don't they ask you 
anything? 
  [Fondo] No, we are all at peace with ourselves. 
  [Santos] That means, then, that the journalists are the only 
people who are troubling you, General? 
  [Fondo] No, not even the journalists, who, I think, are only 
looking for the truth. 
  [Santos] Hypothetically, were you to make accusations 
against 
the Renamo leader, could you have made them? Perhaps you have 
collected evidence of some irregularities in all the time you 
have worked.... 
  [Fondo] As a general and a member of the FAM forces, I have 
had to overcome hurdles from the outset. We have had political 
problems with Portugal. Everything ended automatically. Good 
boy. [as published] 
  Then we had [Ian] Smith. There were very serious problems, 
widespread destruction, and the war was over. Good boy. 
  Now, we are going through a time of reconciliation. I have 
no accusations to make against anyone. The country, the people, 
are engaged in reconciliation at this time, to ensure that the 
country is free and that people enjoy peace and independence 
after going for so long without knowing what independence really 
is and, above all, without enjoying the fruit of the national 
liberation armed struggle. 
  [Santos] As you said at the beginning of the interview, 
perhaps we can cut your interview in half by beginning at the 
time when you were already commander of the border security 
forces. Let us go back in time, then. When did you join Frelimo? 
  [Fondo] I joined Frelimo directly in 1965. 
  [Santos] Like many others, did you use the Swaziland route? 
  [Fondo] Yes, via Swaziland, South Africa, Botswana, Zambia, 
and up to Tanzania. 
  [Santos] So you met up with Frelimo in Tanzania? 
  [Fondo] Yes, I did. 
  [Santos] Is that where you were trained? 
  [Fondo] Yes. All our group was trained in Tanzania. 
  [Santos] Then you had to fight. What front were you on? 
  [Fondo] I was always lucky, really very lucky. Perhaps my 
colleagues did not have that sort of luck. I went on courses 
abroad, came back to Tanzania, and that is how it was. 
  [Santos] Were you in Algeria, too? 
  [Fondo] No, I was not in Algeria. Eventually, I was placed 
in Cabo Delgado Province. People even thought I was a member of 
the Maconde tribe. I speak the Maconde language, and I am proud 
of it. I am proud of coming from the south and of speaking a 
northern language. I am proud of having friends there whom I 
regard as more my brothers than the people from my own area. I 
had very close relations with them. 
  [Santos] So, you fought in Cabo Delgado, then? 
  [Fondo] Yes, I did. I also used to go abroad and then return 
to Cabo Delgado. After the period of transitional government, I 
came to these parts and I was even chosen as a commander. I was 
the first provincial military commander for Cabo Delgado 
Province. Then, I was in Maputo, Gaza, and Mapai. Then Smith 
came up and caused another problem. He presented another cheek. 
That was it: I was sent to Inhambane then. 
  [Santos] Are you resting now that there is peace? 
  [Fondo] Yes, now I am resting. 
  [Santos] You are not confined yet? 
  [Fondo] A general is never confined. When the times comes 
for a general to be confined...a general can only be retired, 
not confined.

  [Text] Jose de Castro, Mozambique National Resistance's 
[Renamo] foreign secretary, said his movement does not agree 
with the salary payment increments beacuse they only benefit a 
minority group. Jose de Castro, who was speaking after a long 
tour of the country, said the government is infiltrating State 
Information and Security Service elements into the Renamo 
provincial delegations with the aim of destabilizing the 
movement. The Renamo secretary for foreign affairs said his 
party's militants are being demoted, transferred, or even 
expelled from the state apparatus and companies.

  [Text] The Supreme Command of the future FADM [Mozambique 
Defense Armed Forces] was appointed in Maputo yesterday at a 
meeting of the CCFADM [Joint Commission for the Formation of the 
Mozambique Defense Armed Forces]. Brigadier Lagos Henriques 
Lidimo was appointed for the government's side, while the 
Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] appointed Lieutenant 
General Mateus Ngonhamo. 
  The two generals named to the FADM Supreme Command still 
have 
to be confirmed by the Supervision and Control Commission [CSC]. 
  The main task of government Brig. Lagos Henriques Lidimo and 
Renamo Lt. Gen. Mateus Ngonhamo will be to guide and lead the 
troops of the future single and nonpartisan army until the new 
government, which will emerge from the general elections 
scheduled for October, is sworn in. Brig. Lagos Lidimo, 44, was 
born in Mueda, Cabo Delgado, and joined the Popular Forces for 
the Liberation of Mozambique [FPLM] in June 1966, having 
attended a commander course on weapons at Vistrel Military 
Academy. 
  From 1970 to 1974, he was deputy security and operations 
chief for Cabo Delgado Province. Between 1975 and 1994, he was 
head of the Senior Official Security Directorate; Protection 
Regiment commander; Military Counterintelligence, CIM, director; 
military commander for Zambezia Province; commander of the 
Maputo Military Garrison; and commander of the border security 
troops. 
  In turn, Renamo Lt. Gen. Mateus Ngonhamo, aged 30, was born 
in Dombe District, Manica Province. He told the press he joined 
the ranks of the armed movement in 1978 as a soldier and rose to 
lieutenant general in 1992 after commanding the Renamo forces in 
the southern region, with a base was located in Chibuto 
District, Gaza District. 
  We received reports saying that, as well as presenting names 
for the FADM Supreme Command generals, the government and Renamo 
also presented lists containing the names of 62 officers who 
will attend a leadership training course on 7 February, with 
each side bringing in 31 men. 
  Those officers will join the General Staff as well as some 
of 
the main commands, which will be part of the FADM structure. 
  With regard to training the infantry forces, special forces, 
marines, and mine removal personnel, NOTICIAS has learned from 
General Tobia Dai, head of the government team to the CCFADM, 
that all courses are to begin in the first half of February.

  [Text] Potchefstroom Jan 31 SAPA--African National Congress 
[ANC] President Nelson Mandela on Monday [31 January] told 
supporters not to engage in violence against innocent people. 
  Speaking at Potchefstroom's Ikageng Stadium, Mr Mandela said 
some of "our" people wanted to kill every Zulu because they 
thought incorrectly that all Zulus belonged to the Inkatha 
Freedom Party. "Even if they do support Inkatha, do not kill 
them. Sit down and talk," he said. 
  Mr Mandela said all parties should be allowed to canvass 
freely in townships, but this did not include Bophuthatswana's 
President Lucas Mangope. "I won't say to you you must allow 
Mangope to canvass in the townships -- that I will not say," he 
said. 
  Crime and violence had reached unacceptably high levels in 
South Africa, which was now known as the most violent country in 
the world, said Mr Mandela. 
  About 18,000 people had died in political violence since 
1984, with as many as 12 people dying daily. There were 775 
assaults every day and about 51 people were killed daily in 
non-political violence. Fraud had increased by 80 percent in 
the past few years and 1,058 people were raped daily, although 
only 68 of these cases were reported to police. 
  Mr Mandela said the SA Police force was not sympathetic to 
blacks and 64 percent of black adults felt hostile toward police. 
  Every South African had the right to live in safety, free 
from crime and violence. The ANC planned to create social 
justice and a democratic order which meant people would respect 
the law of the country. 
  Mr Mandela stressed that community policing was the most 
viable option to combat crime. "The police must be visible and 
in touch with the community." Better training was needed, not 
more police. 
  Much of the culture of violence had its roots in apartheid, 
which had caused poverty and human degradation, said Mr Mandela. 
  There was no quick fix for the costly and complex process of 
uplifting poor people. "But if we develop human potential and 
people are able to participate in the social and democratic 
process, we will have responsible and productive people." One of 
the most important ways would be through education. 
  At present, 25 percent of annual expenditure was spent on 
education. The ANC did not need more funds to implement its 
ambitious youth and adult education programmes. "Waste, 
inefficiency and corruption must be stopped if we are to meet 
out goals within budget. The ANC has budgeted R[rand]14 billion 
for salaries, R1 billion for teacher training, R1 billion for 
school supplies and R500 million on school buildings." 
  Mr Mandela received a tumultuous welcome on his tour of the 
Western Transvaal where thousands of people flocked to see their 
hero during a hectic two-day schedule including seven mass 
meetings in the scorching sun. 
  After speaking to a small group of farm workers at the 
Boskop 
Training Centre outside Potchefstroom on Monday morning, Mr 
Mandela sped to the Ikageng Stadium to address the squatter and 
poorer community. 
  He explained the ANC's Redevelopment and Construction 
Programme and the ANC election manifesto which promised a 
"better future for all". 
  His final stop on Monday is the Potchefstroom town centre's 
banquet hall, where he will address businessmen and academics. 
  Security has been stepped up for fear of a rightwing 
interference.

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 31 SAPA--The National Party [NP] 
says African National Congress [ANC] leader Nelson Mandela's 
"traitor" speech in Potchefstroom on Sunday [30 January] has 
revealed a sinister agenda. The NP was reacting on Monday to 
suggestions by Mr Mandela in his speech in Potchefstroom's 
Primoso township that "coloureds" and Indians who voted for the 
NP were "traitors". 
  It said the ANC leader's words were a complete contradiction 
of his earlier call for all parties to be allowed free access to 
all communities. "This is once again proof that the ANC talks 
with a forked tongue. The sort of see-sawing contained in the 
ANC's pronouncements indicate to us that they intend to continue 
with a hidden agenda once in power. They are portraying typical 
communist tactics to appease the electorate they are about to 
pounce on." 
  The NP demanded a reconfirmation from the ANC that it would 
not promote political intolerance.

<F P=106> [Interview with Afrikaner National Front co-leader Gen. </F>
Constand Viljoen by SABC presenter Freek Robinson in the 
Johannesburg studio on the "Agenda" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Robinson] First, I want to congratulate you for 
being selected as one of the news personalities for Agenda 1993. 
We made the announcement last night, but I want to say welcome, 
you are here, and we are going to use this whole program to 
focus on this critical point in the history of the country, when 
negotiations have reached a real difficult stage. 
  First, you have already been involved in the talks. You 
spoke over the weekend, and you were involved in negotiation 
last week. What is the present situation now in the 
negotiations, specifically with your endeavor to reach a 
settlement with the ANC [African National Congress] and with the 
government? 
  [Viljoen] Freek, we have two sets of negotiations going 
on--those of the Freedom Alliance and the Afrikaner National 
Front [AVF] is also engaged with the ANC regarding the issue of 
the Afrikaner. 
  [Robinson] Only with the ANC and not with the government? 
  [Viljoen] The government is part of it. In other words, it 
is what they call trilateral discussions on both levels--that of 
the alliance and that of the subcommittee. 
  [Robinson] Let's just speak in general terms. Today's 
discussions--how did they go? In fact, as we are talking here, 
they are still going on. How are they progressing? 
  [Viljoen] The problem that we have is the so-called time 
limits that have been introduced. We got together this morning, 
and, in ight of what happened over the weekend, we... 
  [Robinson, interrupting] Who met? 
  [Viljoen] The negotiating teams of the National Front, the 
ANC, and that of the government. We met. We discussed the 
matter, and we came to the conclusion that the tension that came 
about over the weekend, particularly the rejection of the 
strategic alternative -- that of war, which we discussed on 
Saturday. This matter was discussed, and we concluded that we 
need more time. We then reported back.... 
  [Robinson, interrupting] Were you all unanimous in the 
conclusion? 
  [Viljoen] Yes. We arrived at the conclusion that, if we are 
trying to force what we have been discussing during the last 10 
days as an alternative, it would not work. Now we are trying to 
look at the matter from a fresh perspective. This morning, we 
told the people that there is no way in which we can reach part 
of an agreement by Thursday because the moment one changes the 
key aspects, then the ANC has to go back to its principals and 
we have to go back to ours. In other words, we are not 
authorized to fully make all the decisions ourselves. At a 
certain stage, we have to report back to our principals. 
  [Robinson] Has it been accepted that Thursday is the new 
deadline? 
  [Viljoen] It has not necessarily been accepted, but it is 
something that cannot be ignored. The ANC usually meets with 
its Executive Council on Wednesdays, and they will have to look 
at what our proposed amendments to the plans so that we will be 
able to get feedback from them on Thursday. In addition, our 
own people must get together on Wednesday so that we can also 
give feedback and, in my opinion, Thursday--or even Friday--is 
the earliest that we can wind up. 
  [Robinson] But you interpretation would be then that the 
deadline should get postponed effectively? 
  [Viljoen] Yes, you know, the government has too many 
deadlines. If the one is not suitable then we go on to the next 
one, and it is not very clear when the deadline really is. It 
is a sign of pressure. 
  [Robinson] Today had been set as one? 
  [Viljoen] Today had been set as one. As far back as the 
24th, we started with deadlines. And we get a new one each 
time. It is also good that way as we have a big, responsible 
task to carry out. The differences between a peaceful election 
or a violent one, or the difference between war or greater 
violence and peace in the country....[pauses] That is why it's 
important that we should get enough time. You know, a lady from 
Bosnia recently said to me that rather a thousand days of 
negotiations than one day of civil war. And I think that should 
be our approach. We have to negotiate the matter thoroughly. 
We have to look each other squarely in the eye, and we have to 
reach a conclusion. And if we have progressed to a certain 
level, and we report back to our people as we did on Saturday, 
and we can see that the people are not happy, then it's no good 
to just ignore that and carry on. You have to go back and 
present something new at the table and see if you can't solve 
the problem. 
  [Robinson] We will get to all the things that could be 
brought to the table. I just want to get some clarity about 
this: Thursday is another deadline, and there is time until 
then or even until Friday. 
  [Viljoen] That is as far as the National Front is concerned. 
The Freedom Alliance had a plenary discussion today--I'm not 
sure how far they progressed, but it doesn't look too 
encouraging. 
  [Robinson] Why? 
  [Viljoen] Progress today was very disappointing. There was 
too much arguing among themselves on constitutional issues, and 
it seemed to me that there was no wish from both sides to make 
any breakthroughs. It was as though the people were just trying 
to provoke each other. 
  [Robinson] Just to confirm again, General, in other words, 
can we assume that you are going to negotiate until Thursday or 
Friday? 
  [Viljoen] Look, if one asked what the limitation was, one 
would then say that the constitutional limitation is that the 
election be promulgated 60 to 90 days before election day. If 
one takes 60 days, then one finds oneself well into February. 
And one has to consider that there are certain amendments, in 
other words, Parliament will have to be convened. It is not 
within my sphere of interests to know how long it takes to 
convene Parliament, but I would say that it can be done within a 
week. As far as I'm concerned, if we really want to become 
serious about a negotiated settlement, then we ought to make 
ourselves available to carry on until the 10th -- if we are 
serious about finding a solution. 
  [Robinson] Let's refer now to what happened on Saturday. You 
are saying that your strategic alternative was rejected just 
before the meeting itself. How did you read it? Did you see it 
as an insult to you, personally, and a rejection of your 
leadership? 
  [Viljoen] I want to start by saying that this strategic 
alternative is not an alternative proposed by me. I reported 
our stance back to the meeting, and I gave them an overview 
right from the establishment of the National Front. I said that 
we have reached a stage where there are two alternatives. One 
is war -- if we want our homeland by the 27th of April. The 
other is a strategic alternative that can continue after 27 
April--that is to say, we accept that we will not get our 
homeland by 27 April. Those are the two alternatives I proposed. 
  [Robinson] Take part, and then negotiate thereafter? 
  [Viljoen] Yes, that was the idea....[pauses] Look, the 
problem was that we have always been accused of not wanting to 
prove our support base despite all the requests we directed at 
the government -- that we wanted to hold our own election to 
prove that the Afrikaner wants a homeland -- the government 
blocked us effectively all the way from doing this. Now that we 
are nearing the end of the negotiation process, both the ANC and 
the government are saying to us we must prove our support base. 
Then they suggested that this proof cannot take place before 27 
April because the department that will be working on that is too 
busy. It is preparing for the election. In any case, you know 
very well that the National Party is busy with an election 
campaign, and I don't think it suits the National Party right 
now -- through an Afrikaner election -- to be made aware that 
the Afrikaner really needs a homeland. 
  [Robinson] Are you saying that the National Party or the 
government are trying not to find a settlement so that you must 
not take part? 
  [Viljoen] No, it is possible. But I am saying that it suits 
the government that no such election is held. It could happen 
that the election could prove to be in favor of the homeland 
idea and the government has always been against it. It would 
put the government in an election dilemma. In any case, the 
government does not want fights from both sides. It doesn't 
want to fight the ANC and the Afrikaner National Front. But the 
point that I'm making is that we are going into an election 
campaign, and all the utterances and decisions being made on a 
political level are colored by the interests of political 
parties in the election. 
  [Robinson] General, the question I have just asked you -- 
there are two questions still waiting. The first one is 
specifically--that the strategic alternative is--voting must 
take place on 27 April in a people's election, as you would put 
it to the voters. [sentence as heard] 
  [Viljoen] The whole idea was that on 27 April you vote for 
the Afrikaner National Front and that all those votes would be 
counted as a vote for the Afrikaner homeland. So if there were 
1 million votes for the Afrikaner National Front, then it would 
be accepted that the support base would be 1 million people. 
  [Robinson] Now back to my original question: When you 
announced this alternative -- whether it was your own or not -- 
the crowd booed you. How do you explain that? Was it a 
rejection of your leadership? That's what some people are 
saying. 
  [Viljoen] Let me put it this way. At the moment, I am the 
coordinator of the directorate. We generals were asked to give 
strategic leadership in this struggle. Strategic leadership 
does not only mean warfare. It means coordinating other forms 
of pressure, be it political, economic, and even military. I am 
there to give advice. I give it as I see it. On Saturday, I 
was not giving advice, I was simply summarizing the situation. 
I had not even gotten to the advice yet, to say what we felt 
about the situation, whether it was acceptable or not. But the 
crowd was already very angry. That is a sign of how the 
Afrikaner really feels today. Saturday's meeting must not be 
seen as a demonstration against me as a person. They shouted 
and went wild because I had dared to go against their wishes. 
There was an unmistakable indication from among the people, who 
had come from all over the country.... 
  [Robinson, interrupting] General, can we determine who those 
people were? I was unfortunately not present, but I have tried 
to make inquiries, and it would appear that some of those who 
shouted the loudest were uniformed people, members of the AWB, 
the Afrikaner Resistance Movement. Am I correct? Do they 
speak on behalf of the Afrikaner people? 
  [Viljoen] Mr. Robinson, you know the AWB. You know they are 
people who make themselves heard. They are people who express 
their feelings at a meeting. That is what one could see on the 
surface. But beyond that, there are the farmers. Today a group 
of farmers called on me and discussed this issue. And let me 
tell you, if there was noise at the meeting, among the farmers 
there is a rumbling. There is a lot of impatience, a lot of 
rejection of what is going to take place. What have the 
Afrikaners gained to date? Absolutely nothing. At the end of 
the bilateral process it was beginning to look as though a 
settlement might be possible. Then in early January, somewhere 
around the 8th, Mr. Mandela, in one speech after another, said 
things which were completely at odds with the spirit of the 
negotiations. Where we had been so serious about reaching an 
agreement, we could now barely get together an ANC team to go 
ahead with the talks. We had hoped to complete the process by 
20 January, but.... 
  [Robinson, interrupting] General, you have covered that 
already. But today you were again involved in more talks with 
the ANC. On Saturday, there was talk of war. You have yourself 
referred to war or some other form of action, possibly economic, 
as one of the possible alternatives. You have used the term 
minimum violence. What exactly do you mean by that? 
  [Viljoen] Look, Freek, what has the ANC done with the 
negotiations? They have always backed the talks with violence. 
They used mass action and economic violence, boycotts, so-called 
stayaways. They used these to put pressure on the process. The 
Afrikaners have reached the point where they shout for joy when 
one mentions war, and boo when one mentions a peaceful solution. 
That is the situation. The Afrikaners are now putting on the 
pressure. 
  [Robinson] What form will it take? 
  [Viljoen] A very dangerous situation is developing. In the 
near future we are going to reach a point where not even I will 
be able to control the situation. 
  [Robinson] What makes you say that? What have you observed? 
  [Viljoen] The anger of the people, because they have 
nothing. 
All along we have told our people that our goal is a homeland by 
27 April. Now we must stop, because the government and the ANC 
say it is not possible. The government says there is no time 
for a referendum before that date. The ANC says it does not 
suit them. So once again it involves the election. These two 
organizations do not want to agree to a homeland. 
  [Robinson] Gen. Viljoen, we have dealt with that point. My 
question is, what form will the violence take? The weekend 
newspapers reported that the generals have warned President de 
Klerk of a threatened uprising among the right wing. You have 
said you know the people are angry. Is it a fact that the 
uprising is being planned, and that it will involve weapons, 
targets, and that kind of thing? 
  [Viljoen] Freek, that an uprising is coming, there can be no 
doubt. I think it is unavoidable. At Saturday's meeting I did 
not expect such a violent reaction. I can spell out the 
signs.... 
  [Robinson] But do you know as a fact that people are busy 
organizing with weapons and selecting targets? 
  [Viljoen] No, we have not yet started selecting targets. 
What I can say is that I warned on Saturday, and I repeat, we 
have the potential to start a war. Since our first meeting at 
Potchefstroom, I have been warning people to believe me when I 
say that the Afrikaner's freedom is priceless, and that we will 
not be satisfied with anything less than a homeland. 
  [Robinson] Could you.... 
  [Viljoen, interrupting] Believe me when I say it is a matter 
of peace. The Afrikaner wants a peaceful solution if it is at 
all possible. If that is not possible, if the Afrikaners are 
ignored, if we ignore the Zulus, if we ignore the Tswanas, then 
there is going to be an uprising in this country. 
  [Robinson] I have already asked you about that uprising. Do 
you know whether it will involve hidden caches of weapons? 
  [Viljoen] Weapons are freely available. We do not need to 
hide weapons in caches. Our people have their weapons. We are 
not hiding tanks and armored vehicles in bushes in preparation 
for war. We already have weapons. But one must not give the 
impression that the Afrikaner sees that as the only solution. 
There are those who say, as they did on Saturday, that we must 
shoot, and shoot right away. But let me assure you that the 
vast majority of Afrikaners are responsible people, in the sense 
that they would much rather choose an alternative to armed 
violence. 
  [Robinson] What is that alternative which you have on the 
table, and which you are at present discussing with the various 
parties like the ANC and the government, and which you hope to 
have resolved by Thursday? 
  [Viljoen] Freek, we will have to get the ANC and the 
government to reconsider the possibility of a homeland by 27 
April. We reject the story that it is not possible to hold a 
referendum before that date. We believe that is merely a means 
of preventing Afrikaners from demonstrating their power base. 
  [Robinson] What is the minimum that you would accept? As 
they say in English, what is your bottom line? [preceeding two 
words in English] 
  [Viljoen] Our bottom line [preceeding two words in English] 
is a referendum, or a plebiscite, call it what you will, in 
February to prove our support. Then we are prepared to 
establish a homeland council and to inaugurate that homeland by 
27 April. That is what our people demand. It is not what I 
demand. 
  [Robinson] That is your bottom line. What happens if you do 
not get it? An uprising? 
  [Viljoen] I assure you, that is the minimum. If we do not 
get that, much as I regret having to say it, there is going to 
be trouble. Nothing will stop the Afrikaner. I am not issuing 
threats. I merely want to give you the facts. I must give you 
the facts. And let me add that I believe the first thing to be 
affected will be the election. If the Afrikaner is not allowed 
that basic right, we cannot see how the election can go ahead. 
It will not be a deliberate act. The violence factor in the 
country is already so high, and if we add this issue, that 
violence will go through the ceiling. 
  [Robinson] General Viljoen, thank you for taking part in the 
program tonight. The negotiations are continuing this week. I 
am not choosing sides. I opt for peace, and I am not ashamed of 
that. I hope all goes well. 
  [Viljoen] I agree. Thank you.

  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 1 SAPA--Nine train trucks were 
derailed by an explosion between Kroonstad and Koppies in the 
Orange Free State shortly after midnight on Tuesday [1 
February], police and Spoornet [Railnet] said. 
  A locomotive and a section of the line were damaged when a 
goods train apparently set off an explosive device. Free State 
Police Liaison Officer Major Johlene van der Merwe said police 
were investigating the possibility of a link between this 
explosion and other blasts in the Free State over the past two 
months. 
  The Kroonstad blast occurred minutes after a locomotive was 
damaged by an explosive device detonated under a goods train on 
a railway line between Harrisburg and Leeudooringstad in the 
Western Transvaal shortly before midnight. The blast disrupted 
rail traffic on the line for four hours and damage is estimated 
at R[rand] 20,000. 
  A metre of the Cape Town/Johannesburg main line was damaged 
in the Kroonstad blast but traffic was not affected as trains 
were rerouted to the down line, Spoornet spokesman Jacques 
Pienaar said. All nine coaches have been put back on the rails, 
he added.

new station has vowed to go on air before the April election 
without a broadcasting license. The station, Radio Community, 
will be broadcasting from Soshanguve in Pretoria. Its 
application for temporary license was turned down. 
  Meanwhile, Radio Pretoria continued broadcasting today 
despite a Pretoria Supreme Court order upholding the postmaster

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>
  ANC Unwilling To Make Negotiations Concessions--"The African 
National Congress [ANC] does not want the White Right to launch 
a campaign of violence, still less civil war, but it rejects the 
idea of a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] and apparently cannot 
offer any alternative that will satisfy the Right," points out 
the page-6 editorial in Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 
31 January. President de Klerk "wants an inclusive settlement, 
but the ANC, scenting victory at the polls, is not prepared to 
make the concessions that would bring such a settlement into 
being." THE CITIZEN urges a "peaceful solution even now, at the 
11th hour." 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Call To Accommodate White Right--"On Saturday the 
bigger-mouthed segment of a right-wing rally howled down words 
of moderation from General Constand Viljoen," notes a page-14 
editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 1 February. 
"The shouts and cat-calls of the swastika brigade do not 
represent the bulk of the white Right." Yet, the political 
process "must give them as much accommodation as it can. So 
far, it has not been enough." "Unless the conservatives -- 
black and white -- take part, the election will be fraught. We 
repeat our suggestion that separate national and regional polls 
be considered. This would go a long way to meeting the concerns 
of conservatives -- as well as other important parties like the 
PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] and the DP [Democratic Party]." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  ANC's Election Manifesto `Consciously 
Populist'--Johannesburg 
BUSINESS DAY in English on 1 February in a page-6 editorial says 
the ANC's election manifesto and its reconstruction and program 
"are consciously populist in nature, underpinned by a 
justifiable fear of increased social instability if a new 
government fails to `deliver.'" However, the ANC recognizes the 
importance of local and foreign business confidence, so "it 
promises to carry out is programme without increasing individual 
and corporate tax rates or imposing punitive wealth taxes, while 
maintaining a Budget deficit of no more than 6 percent of GDP -- 
better than the NP [National Party] has managed over the past 
two years. In combination, this is heartwarming and reassuring. 
The problem, already pointed out here and elsewhere, is that 
the arithmetic does not add up. Taken at face value, it raises 
the spectre of hyperinflation and a debt trap. This explains 
the panic and hysteria that have marked some commentaries." 
BUSINESS DAY notes that the ANC and the Congress of South 
African Trade Unions, "confronted with harsh economic realities 
and skilled negotiators, have shown a preparedness to recognise 
what is possible and what is not. Business and economic 
commentators, before they panic, should do the same." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  Postpone Elections as Last Resort Settlement -- Johannesburg 
SOWETAN in English on 1 February in a page 6 editorial asks 
whether "more substantial negotiations" to ensure a peaceful 
transition to democracy in South Africa are necessary. If there 
is not an all-inclusive settlement there is the "very real 
possibility" that the 27 April elections could be disrupted. 
SOWETAN urges all parties involved in bilateral, trilateral and 
multiparty talks to "return to the drawing board once more. The 
postponement of the election by a month or two should also not 
be ruled out as a last resort."

  [Text] The wait-and-see attitude prevailing in the country 
in the wake of the CFA franc devaluation, which went into effect 
on 12 January, has ended. Prime Minister Abdoulaye Sekou Sow, 
who was addressing the nation's elected representatives 
yesterday, announced the definite measures taken by his 
government to tackle the devaluation. For the rural people, an 
increase in the producer price of cotton has been decided. For 
first-grade cotton, the price is henceforth fixed at 115 CFA 
francs per kilo for the 1994-95 season, compared with 85 CFA 
francs previously. For the 1993-94 season, an anticipated 
rebate of 12.5O CFA francs per kilo is granted cotton seed 
producers. 
  With regard to income, the government has conceded a 10 
percent general increase of indexed wages, military pensions, 
and civil pensions, effective 1 April. All arrears owed under 
the social pact will be fully paid over 24 months starting 1 
March. The interoccupational minimum wage and the agricultural 
guaranteed minimum wage have also been increased by 8 percent, 
effective 1 April. 
  The prices of essential goods have also been fixed as 
follows: powdered sugar, 325 francs per kilo; rice RM [expansion 
unknown] 40, 210 francs per kilo; bottled oil, 455 CFA francs 
per liter; refined oil in drum, 412 per liter; household soap, 
100 CFA francs for a 200g cake. For hydrocarbons, premium-grade 
gas, 423 CFA francs per liter compared with 325 CFA francs 
previously; regular-grade gas, 390 CFA francs compared with 300 
CFA francs; gas oil, 275 CFA francs per liter compared with 210 
CFA francs; DDO [expansion unknown] heavy-duty fuel, 199 CFA 
francs per liter compared with 147 francs; fuel oil, 223 francs 
per liter compared with 117.38 CFA francs; mixed fuel, 430 CFA 
francs compared with 340 CFA francs; the price of kerosene 
remains 200 CFA francs; butane gas, 3,500 CFA francs per 12.5kg 
bottle compared with 3,000 CFA francs previously. 
  The head of government stated that the increase in the price 
of fuel was inevitable as a result of the increase from supply 
sources, and this in spite of the efforts made by importers. 
This increase remains however below the prevailing price levels 
in most neighboring countries. The prime minister further 
stated that the opportunity offered by the change of parity 
should be seized by our country with a view to improving 
significantly the competitive edge of the economy and 
reestablishing swiftly the major macroeconomic balances. 
According to him, if the devaluation -- which has been accepted 
by all -- is well handled through consultations, the nation's 
economy can be boosted and the country developed on a sound and 
productive base.

  [Text] Niamey, Jan 31 (AFP)--Two people were killed when 
Tuareg rebels attacked a military escorted convoy of more than 
100 four-wheel drive vehicles, military police said Monday [31 
January]. 
  The victims, a driver and a woman passenger, were at the 
head 
of the convoy when an unknown number of rebels suddenly appeared 
out of the night and opened fire, police added. 
  Saturday's attack, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) from 
Agadez 
in the centre of the dry, landlocked central African country, is 
the second since a ceasefire between the government and nomadic 
Tuaregs ended last December. 
  Seven people, four rebels, two paramilitary police and a 
villager, were killed on January 19 when rebels attacked the 
market at Tahoua, 400 kilometers (250 miles) northeast of Niamey.

  [Text] Niamey, 29 Jan (AFP) -- Four Chadian rebels of the 
Movement for Democracy and Development were killed by Niger 
Republican Guards in the Lake Chad Region (extreme east of 
Niger) on 28 January, Niger national radio reported today. 
According to the radio, a group of six rebels, who came to 
trade fleece in a market, was surprised by a detachment of the 
Republican Guard, which opened fire, killing four of them. The 
national radio did not give any details about the fate of the 
two remaining Chadian rebels. 
  This incident occurred while a Niger delegation led by 
Interior Minister Ousmane Oumarou was in Ndjamena from 27 to 28 
January for a series of talks devoted to the problem of Chadian 
refugees in Niger and, more generally, to security at the border 
between the two countries. According to Oumarou, some 3,600 
Chadians have taken refuge in Niger since the political changes 
that have taken place in Chad over the past few years. The 
Niger minister, quoted by the national radio, assured the 
Ndjamena authorities that "Niger would not serve as a rear base 
and would not tolerate the presence of armed soldiers on its 
territory seeking to destabilize the current democratic process 
in Chad."

  [Text] Niger customs officials are angry. They have 
decided to embark on a one-week strike, which will have very 
serious consequences on the country's economy. Monthly customs 
revenue is in the vicinity of 3 billion CFA francs and 
constitutes the main resource for the Treasury. This resource 
represents the equivalent of the wage bill of the country's 
35,000 civil servants. This strike will be of concern to the 
country's leaders especially when [words indistinct]. From 
Niamey, Malam Yaro reports: 
  [Begin recording] Minimum services are guaranteed by the 
strikers and certain border posts are almost empty since the 
beginning of the general strike called by customs officials. 
This has led people to say that the call has been largely 
heeded. It all started during a routine customs check last 
month at Nkonni, an important border post with Nigeria. Some 
customs officials chased smugglers aboard a vehicle containing 
fuel [words indistinct]. The customs officials opened fire on 
the vehicle, killing one person. The people of the town, 
angered by this incident, refused to submit themselves to custom 
checks. The National Customs Union reacted by asking its 
activists to observe a 48-hour work stoppage. Negotiations were 
immediately entered into between the government and the union. 
The political authorities promised at the time to resolve the 
problem and, especially, to give full powers to customs 
officials to enable them to carry out their work well. Order 
was therefore established. 
  According to the customs union, however, the situation has 
become more and more complicated on the field between the 
civilians and the customs officials. To protest this state of 
affairs, the customs union has called for a seven-day general 
strike that will inevitably have adverse consequences on the 
country's economy. [end recording] 
  [Niamey Voix du Sahel Network in French at 0535 GMT on 1 
February carries the following announcement by the director 
general of customs: "Following telephone conversations with 
regional and central directors of customs on the strike called 
by the National Union of Customs on 31 January, it has been 
noted that a great majority of customs workers have not heeded 
the strike order. The director general of customs congratulates 
such customs officers for their wisdom, understanding, and high 
sense of national interest. He encourages them to continue to 
place the supreme interest of the nation above everything else. 
Finally, the director general of customs would like to reassure 
those who want to go to work that measures will be taken to 
protect them from any form of threat."]

  [Text] The chief of Army staff, Major General Mohamed Chris 
Alli, has called on Britain and the United States to lift the 
sanctions imposed on the Nigerian Armed Forces. Gen. Alli made 
the appeal in Somalia when he visited the United Nations deputy 
secretary general, Mr. Lansana Kouyate, as part of his tour of 
areas where Nigerian troops are serving in peacekeeping 
operations. He said it was an irony that the Nigerian Army, 
which over the years had made immense contributions towards the 
maintenance of world peace, had become a victim of international 
sanctions. 
  The chief of Army staff said the lifting of the sanctions 
was 
necessary to enhance the contributions of the Armed Forces to 
the United Nations peacekeeping operation. He again assured the 
international community that the present administration had 
commenced the process of democratization to return the country 
to complete civil rule.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Three weeks ago, Nigeria's military ruler, General 
Sani Abacha, set up a 19-member commission to prepare for a 
forthcoming constitutional conference. But since then, there 
has been mounting criticism from civil rights groups, student 
bodies, and from individuals over the commission's membership. 
Some people think there should be a sovereign national 
conference instead. At the moment, the commission is inviting 
submissions from interested parties to work out an agenda. 
Later this week, the commission will be deciding on certain key 
issues, including fixing a date for the conference. In Lagos, 
Sola Odunfa went to see the commission's secretary, Debor 
Okandi, and he asked him if he would be passing on to the 
conference all the suggestions the commission receives. 
  [Begin recording] [Okandi] No. You see, our commission is 
expected to collect the memoranda, sift through them and pull 
out the ideas the public would like to discuss, so we will not 
pass all the memoranda received to the conference. 
  [Odunfa] Will that not be seen as the commission censoring 
the opinions put forward? 
  [Okandi] No, that is not censoring, because what we are 
going 
to do is to look at all the points raised by the memoranda and 
to reduce the work of the conference in the sense that if you 
have got 10 memoranda repeating some items, it is better to 
collate them into one, instead of making the whole conference 
look at them all over again. So, we are not going to censor, we 
are going to ensure that all the different points raised are put 
into the agenda for the conference. 
  [Odunfa] Let us assume that some Nigerians suggest that the 
country should break up and give reasons for this. Will you 
forward this to the conference? 
  [Okandi] Definitely, you see the agenda for the conference 
will represent the views and the moods of the country. The mood 
of the country will be reflected in the agenda. You can take it 
from me that the members of the commission are aware that some 
members of the public are in fact saying that the starting point 
should be: Should the country remain one, or should it break up, 
or should it have clauses for secession, or you know, expelling 
any section of the country that becomes troublesome. Whatever 
the public want, we will formulate into the agenda. 
  [Odunfa] At the end of the conference, will you simply 
forward the decisions taken to the Provisional Ruling Council, 
or will you insert your own comments by way of recommendations 
and so on? 
  [Okandi] No, our recommendations will be put there and 
without trying to forecast the work of the commission. Whether 
the views as reached by the conference will be final or not will 
be determined by my commission when they formulate the agenda. 
  [Odunfa] It is not sure yet that the views of the conference 
will be final? 
  [Okandi] No, you see, I am speaking to you just as one 
member. The members have not got to that stage, but I am sure 
the members of the commission already know what the public want, 
and I can assure you, our work will reflect the mood and 
aspirations of Nigerians. 
  [Odunfa] Will the conference appoint its own officers. 
  [Okandi] The conference... [pauses] I daresay, that will be 
part of the recommendations the commission will make and we have 
not got to that stage yet. [end recording]

  [Text] All bureaux de change in the country have been 
directed not to sell foreign exchange any longer. They are now 
limited to the buying of foreign exchange as agents of the 
Central Bank. According to the guidelines on monetary and fiscal 
policy for the current year, the bureaux de change will 
surrender all foreign exchange bought by them to the CBN 
[Central Bank of Nigeria] at the official rate of 22 naira to 
the dollar. They will be entitled to a commission to be decided 
in due course. The guidelines emphasized that the measures are 
taken to create the right environment for the strengthening of 
the value of the naira. It is reiterated that the foreign 
exchange parallel market, otherwise known as the black market, 
remains illegal and the operators of such markets would be 
severely penalized. 
  A decree to implement the new measures and to harmonize the 
existing regulations with the new policy direction will soon be 
promulgated. It will also stipulate penalties for 
infringements. The guidelines require dealers authorized by the 
Central Bank to render prompt, accurate, and coordinated returns 
on foreign exchange transactions entered into on behalf of the 
CBN. Appropriate sanctions are to be imposed on authorized 
dealers who release funds on the basis of forged documents or 
fail to furnish accurate and prompt returns or refuse to report 
defaulting customers. The importation and exportation of naira, 
according to the guidelines, also remain prohibited. However, 
residents going abroad are allowed to carry up to 500 naira on 
them for settlement of local transport expenses immediately on 
their return to Nigeria.

  [Text] Sierra Leone's high commissioner to Britain, 
Professor (Sirim Patrick Sory), has held fruitful discussions in 
London on issues relating to the economic and political future 
of Sierra Leone with Baroness Lynda Chalker, minister for 
overseas development. In the discussions, Prof. (Sory) 
commended the British Government for the positive steps taken in 
resuming aid to Sierra Leone. Baroness Chalker informed the 
high commissioner that the British Government will release 2 
million pounds to the Sierra Leone Government to offset and 
cushion the effects of the structural adjustment program. Prof. 
(Sory) referred to releases made by the World Bank and the IMF, 
which, he said, clearly suggests that the NPRC [National 
Provisional Ruling Council] Government has been able to effect 
conditionalities imposed by the two international organizations 
who are, by all indications, quite happy with the economic 
performance of the NPRC Government. 
  Prof. (Sory), however, noted that the rebel incursion has 
been concentrated in the economically important and viable areas 
of Sierra Leone and, to a greater extent, has dealt a severe 
blow in the strife toward the country's economic emancipation. 
High Commissioner (Sory) said that with the arrival of 
OAU-sponsored troops in Liberia, there is a possibility for 
faction leader Charles Taylor to disarm, a move which will 
increase the chances of peace returning to Sierra Leone, and a 
more greater possibility for a revival of the country's economy. 
On returning Sierra Leone to civilian rule, Prof. (Sory) 
pointed out that the NPRC will do everything possible to adhere 
to the transition program. Baroness Lynda Chalker in her reply 
expressed delight that the NPRC Government has produced a 
detailed transition program and expressed the wish to be kept 
informed about the work of the National Commission for Democracy. 
  Touching on the issue of the four Vietnamese holding British 
passports now facing prison charges in Freetown, Mrs. Chalker 
hoped the matter would be resolved quickly in the courts through 
proper and acceptable legal procedures. Both Prof. (Sory) and 
Baroness Chalker discussed plans for the inauguration of the 
Sierra Leone- United Kingdom Chamber of Commerce due to take 
place on 4 February.

  [Excerpt] We start the news with a communique from the 
territorial administration and security minister. [read by 
announcer] 
  A comparative analysis of the number of voters registered 
during the 27 September 1992 constitutional referendum and the 
upcoming 6 and 20 February legislative elections totally refutes 
allegations that the majority of voters who participated in the 
constitutional referendum have left the country and have become 
refugees in neighboring countries. The number of voters has 
increased considerably in all prefectures due to the 
registration of young voters who reached the voting age after 
the constitutional referendum. 
  Charity organizations, such as the World Food Program, claim 
that more than 400,000 nationals who are exiled in neighboring 
countries will not participate in the upcoming elections. The 
territorial administration and security minister protests such 
allegations, which are not true at all. Togolese citizens who 
meet the conditions set out in the Electoral Code have 
registered in all the prefectures, particularly in the Maritime 
Region. The administrative committees on which all legally 
constituted political parties are represented have prepared the 
electoral lists, and no political party has complained about the 
number of voters registered in the 81 electoral wards. 
  The majority of Togolese wish to have a peaceful and 
tolerant 
democracy. They elected the president of the Republic and they 
will elect their representatives to the National Assembly in a 
peaceful and orderly manner. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] The people of Togo will be going to the polls again 
on Sunday [6 February], this time to elect members of a new 
legislative assembly. Elections have been postponed several 
times amidst complaints of fraudulent voters lists and about 
procedures at polling booths. Edem Kodjo is leader of the UTD 
[Togolese Union for Democracy] party. They have agreed to take 
part in the election but with certain reservations. Our man in 
Lome, Ebow Godwin, asked him about his main concerns. 
  [Begin recording] [Kodjo] There are still two problems, and 
especially one--the problem of the Supreme Court. We don't 
accept the principle that the constitutional branch of the 
Supreme Court to be in charge of the elections petitions and we 
are proposing that the whole Supreme Court should be in charge 
of these petitions. It is a very important problem because we 
don't trust the constitutional branch of the Supreme Court. 
  [Godwin] Why don't you trust the constitutional branch of 
the 
Supreme Court? 
  [Kodjo] Because the composition is too biased, and this 
branch is composed only with the members of the RPT [Rally of 
the Togolese People]. We cannot accept this kind of thing. The 
second one is the problem of the distribution of the cards. We 
are concerned because the district commissioners in charge of 
issues in the districts are not very well equipped, and we are 
not sure that the timing which has been adopted is going to be 
fulfilled. 
  [Godwin] I see that you have fielded 70 candidates. Given 
the right conditions, do you think that you and the other 
opposition groups can beat the RPT party hands down? 
  [Kodjo] I think that we will make a good score. I am not 
going to be too optimistic. The problem is that we don't know 
how things are moving really inside the country, especially in 
the north, in the northern part of our country. But we still 
hope that the mobilization of our parties will make sure that 
there are not too many tricks and make sure that our elections 
are going to be fair. 
  [Godwin] Since the last attack on Lome, the slightest noise 
made by even a burst lorry tire, you know, sends people running, 
panicking, do you think this will affect the security situation 
during the elections? 
  [Kodjo] Let's say that the security situation is not very, 
very good. We in the UTD, we have proposed that we should be 
given a period of what I called neutralization, which will 
permit security to be reinforced, strengthened. Then people 
will have confidence in themselves and confidence in the system. 
Unfortunately, this proposal has been rejected. [end recording]

  [Text] President Eyadema granted an audience to Monsignor 
Philippe Fanoko Kpodzro, the Lome archbishop [and High Council 
of the Republic chairman] on 31 January at Lome II. The head of 
state later received the International Monitoring Committee on 
the Ouagadougou Accords led by its chairman, Herman Yameogo. He 
spoke to newsmen after the meeting. 
  [Begin Yameogo recording] Some time ago, the opposition 
issued a number of demands, and the one that kept coming up 
again and again was the election problem. We were able to 
settle quite a number of these issues thanks to the goodwill 
shown by both the presidential group and the opposition. The 
only issue left was the election problem. The International 
Monitoring Committee held a meeting with the head of state 
today, and the solution we came up with was to initiate 
preliminary reconciliation at the National Electoral Commission 
level to try and solve the differences that might arise after 
the election. If no solution is found after that, the matter 
will then be transferred to the Supreme Court, in line with 
established laws. 
  We also wish to stress that these measures are valid only 
for 
the parliamentary elections, they do not affect past or future 
elections. That is essentially what we decided upon. We have 
noticed that both sides have shown goodwill. The International 
Monitoring Committee is always at their disposal to assist them 
in finding solutions any time there are problems. We would like 
to call on everyone to help in making things go smoothly so that 
there will be peace and we can move toward a suitable solution 
for Togo. Thank you. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Here in Bujumbura town, as you have heard, 
things deteriorated during the day. No work was done, and most 
of the roads in the town were closed. In the suburbs of Musaga, 
Kinanira, and Kanyosha, properties were damaged, and people are 
said to have been killed. It has been reported that peace is 
returning this evening, although tires were burning at road 
blocks between Ngagara and the town center. Security officials 
have tried to put out the fires but movement has been difficult, 
especially for cars. We have not seen any vehicles in 
circulation apart from those of the security services. The 
government has taken the opportunity to say a few words about 
the events through Cyriaque Simbizi, the minister of youth, 
sports, and culture who is also the interim information minister 
and government spokesman. 
  [Begin Simbizi recording] [passage omitted] As things stand, 
those who oppose the government which was put in place by the 
people are also those who pretend not to recognize that the 
current problems have arisen from the killing of the head of 
state. They have been blocking roads, burning, and killing. 
Such behavior at this time is contrary to the spirit of the 
return of peace. In fact, if one takes a close look one finds 
that many opposition leaders are planning to start a war in the 
country. [passage omitted] 
  It is surprising to see that there is no security in 
Bujumbura town though everybody knows that the security forces 
are there in strength. Those who have a complaint against the 
government should not be allowed to express their complaints 
through killing and looting. Is the thirst for power alone 
responsible for the current damages, or do they not know that 
the actions of the opposition are also responsible for those who 
have died? 
  Yesterday more than 30 people died in Musaga zone. They were 
killed by [words indistinct] stones and knives. In Kinindo, two 
people were killed. Tonight, a grenade killed six people in 
Nyakabiga. Also today, some citizens were sho,t and a grenade 
was thrown at others who were trying to remove stones that had 
been put in place by the warmongers. 
  A wise politician looks for power through peaceful means and 
first tries to see if the people he wants to lead will accept 
him. Otherwise we would be heading for dictatorship. [passage 
omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] Congolese Prime Minister Joachim Yhombi-Opango held 
a news conference in Paris this morning. He said he was hopeful 
about finding a solution to the country's chronic violence. 
Mohammed Youssoufou Saliou has the details. 
  [Begin Saliou recording] The prime minister was serene and 
determined at all costs to get his country out of the vicious 
circle of violence. He essentially said there was cause to be 
hopeful about the country's situation. He was optimistic that a 
solution would be found to the differences that exist between 
the Union for Democratic Renewal-Congolese Labor Party Alliance 
and the presidential group. 
  Regarding the thorny issue of the retrieval of illegally 
distributed weapons in Brazzaville, he said plainly that, since 
the beginning of the crisis, Brazzaville had become the dumping 
ground for Zairian arms trafficking. Furthermore, he said that 
80 percent of common-law prisoners in Congo were Zairians. The 
victory of peace in Congo will be ephemeral if there is no peace 
or national reconciliation in Zaire. He said he hoped, 
therefore, that peace would be restored in Zaire. 
  Answering several questions on cooperation between France 
and 
Congo, and especially cooperation with the French petroleum 
company, Elf, the prime minister said nothing clouded relations 
between Paris and Brazzaville and, even less so, relations with 
Elf. He strongly maintained that, on the contrary, relations 
between the two countries were stronger, more profound, and 
deeply rooted. [end recording]

  [Text] Tangible and fruitful results have been produced by 
the efforts to form administrative councils of the Somali 
National Alliance [SNA] in subdistricts, districts, and even in 
Mogadishu and regions under SNA control, said Abdulkadir Farah 
Sidiq, who is a member of the United Somali Congress central 
committee and also the chairman for the formation of SNA 
administrative councils at Xamar Jajab, Xamar Weyne, and 
Boondhere. 
  He spoke at a function at the end of the selection procedure 
of candidates for the Horseed subdistrict in Xamar Jajab 
District. The function was highly organized. Members of the 
internal affairs committee for the formation of districts were 
also present. In a speech, the chairman first noted the need 
for the Somali people to join together. Speaking on the 
progress of administrative councils, he said that these efforts 
will lead the Somali people to justice and can lead to national 
administration. He said the common good must be given priority 
over personal consideration, without favoritism. Lastly, he 
called on the elected members to discharge their duties on the 
basis of perseverance, steadfastness, and piety. 
  Abdi Mohamoud Shegow, the chairman of the Xamar Jajab 
District, also spoke at the function and pointed out that the 
Horseed subdistrict was the foundation on which the district 
stood, and hence there was a need to strengthen its role. The 
reporter for the Voice of the People at the meeting, Urdoh, also 
said that a total of 65 candidates participated. Haji Mohamed 
Nur Muhiyadin was elected chairman of the Horseed subdistrict of 
Xamar Jajab District with 33 votes. Abdullahi Ma'alim Muhammad 
Mufow was elected vice-chairman. Abdulkadir Muyi Habib was 
elected secretary. The reporter said the election was fair. 
Also present was Mr. Muhammad Hasan Siad Amito, who is a member 
of the Xamar Jajab District committee.

  [Text] Cotonou, 1 Feb (AFP)--An AFP journalist observed 
that about 3,000 people gathered at the Cotonou Labor Exchange 
this morning in response to a call by six unions to protest 
against the social consequences of the CFA franc devaluation. 
  For nearly four hours, the demonstrators--many of whom were 
carrying placards bearing slogans hostile to the International 
Monetary Fund and the World Bank--listened to speeches by union 
leaders before dispersing calmly. 
  The various speakers reiterated their demand for a 
"substantial" increase in salary to offset the increase in 
prices of consumer goods sparked off by the devaluation. They 
also called for an increase of more than 300 percent in the 
statutory minimum wage. 
  This rally was due to have been held a week ago but was 
banned by the Beninese Government, which dispatched police to 
the Labor Exchange to prevent the demonstrators from meeting.

  [Excerpt] Niamey, 1 Feb (AFP)--A fourth organization 
claiming to belong to the Tuareg rebellion, the Patriotic Front 
for the Liberation of the Sahara [FPLS], has been established in 
Niger, it was learned today from Tuareg sources here. 
  The FPLS is led by Mohamed Anako, a 30 year-old indigene of 
the Agadez region (750 km northwest of Niamey), who presents 
himself as a "moderate federalist" in his demands, the same 
sources indicate. 
  Niger Interior Minister Ousamane Oumarou, in an interview 
with AFP, stated that the government had "only learned" of the 
emergence of this movement. "We have not been informed 
officially. We therefore do not know the reasons for its 
establishment and do not have any information on its members," 
he added. [passage omitted]

minister on a foreign radio report on the existence or 
establishment of a fourth rebel group. According to Interior 
Minister Ousmane Oumarou, the Niger authorities have not been 
officially informed and therefore do not know anything about the 
reasons for any such group. 
  The radio that reported the news indicated that the group is

  [Text] The rebels have struck again, but it was only this 
morning that the news was reported. On 28 January, they 
attacked a convoy from Dirkou, which was under military escort, 
killing two people, wounding another, and making away with a 
quantity of items. Here is Mounkali Agadem with a report. 
  [Begin recording] As has been the practice for some time 
now, 
the 28 January convoy was escorted by soldiers. Everything was 
proceeding smoothly until the convoy reached some 30 km from 
Agadez, where the attack took place. The assailants attacked 
right in the middle of the convoy, while the military vehicle at 
the rear had stopped a few kilometers away to guard a vehicle 
that had broken down. The rebels therefore had more than enough 
time to commit their act. 
  After unsuccessfully ordering a truck to stop, they shot the 
driver, killing him instantly. A woman, who was on the same 
truck, was burned to death. The third occupant had his ear shot 
off. As if that were not enough, the assailants set fire to the 
vehicle, causing extensive damage to the goods, which were 
estimated at more than 2 million CFA francs by the driver's 
mate, who had his ear shot off. The assailants then proceeded 
to attack the other vehicles, from which they took television 
sets, food items, tape recorders, and other goods. They loaded 
the goods onto their three vehicles before bolting away. 
  The soldiers, after they were alerted, pursued the 
assailants, but they have not found them. According to their 
commanding officer, the search is continuing. 
  It should be noted that this is the third rebel attack in 
less than a month in Agadez Department, where a lot is expected 
from the outcome of the next meeting between the government and 
the rebels. We were not able to go and see for ourselves the 
extent of the damage on the spot, where apparently the vehicles 
were still burning even until yesterday. We were, of course, 
unable to go because we did not have any military escort because 
all trips in that region can only be done under escort. [end

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] The Nigerian Government has been virtually silent so 
far about the sanctions imposed on the military by Britain and 
the United States last year. They were introduced in response 
to the cancellation of last year's program for transition to 
civilian rule and the ousting in November of the civilian-led 
interim government. But now Nigeria's Army chief of staff, who 
has been visiting troops serving in Somalia, has called for the 
sanctions to be lifted and he even suggested that if they 
continue they could interfere with Nigeria's future 
contributions to UN peacekeeping operation. On the line to 
Lagos, Akwe Amosu asked the chief of staff's spokesman, Colonel 
Okon, if the sanctions were really hurting the Nigerian Army. 
  [Begin recording] [Okon] It does hurt in the sense that we 
source our equipment and other war material from the Western 
world. And to be effective and to be continuous in answering to 
UN calls for peacekeeping operations, we need to replace this 
equipment to be able to be effective all the time. 
  [Amosu] Do you actually need to replace large numbers of 
weapons now? 
  [Okon] Not necessarily large numbers if the effectiveness is 
continuous. What the Nigerian Army is saying is that, over the 
years, the Nigerian Army has been called upon by the United 
Nations to take part in peacekeeping operations in troubled 
areas of the world. And, whenever it's been called upon, it 
normally, usually, reacts swiftly. 
  [Amosu] So, would you say that your capacity to continue 
such 
missions overseas is compromised by the sanctions? 
  [Okon] Well, naturally, if an army is out of equipment, then 
certainly its performance will be diminished. 
  [Amosu] The point is that, as you well know, the sanctions 
were in fact imposed as a criticism of the Nigerian Government 
for failing to introduce democratic change fast enough and for 
reneging on promises to move to civilian rule.... 
  [Okon, interrupting] So.... 
  [Amosu, interrupting] And, the question that everybody will 
be asking when they hear you say this is: What have you done to 
merit having the sanctions lifted? 
  [Okon] Yes, well, the Nigerian military did not just scuttle 
the democratic process for the fun of it. What happened is, in 
the circumstances of the situation, the Army had to intervene to 
prevent the nation from total disintegration, which might have 
followed the events in the country. And, right now, what the 
chief of Army staff...[pauses] our people...[pauses] he assured 
the international community that the present administration has 
already commenced in earnest the process of democratization with 
the full aim of returning the country to complete civilian rule. 
  [Amosu] Well, he has said that, but there is very little 
evidence on the ground so far that it is happening. The people 
who imposed the sanctions will want to see concrete evidence 
before they take them away. 
  [Okon] Well, if he says it at that level, you just have to 
believe that that is what has been done. 
  [Amosu] Is Nigeria threatening to withdraw from 
international 
peacekeeping work unless the sanctions are lifted? 
  [Okon] No, no, no, that is not what it has done. No. 
  [Amosu] So, this is just a friendly request from Nigeria to 
the rest of world to stop getting on our backs and just [words 
indistinct]? 
  [Okon] Naturally, it can't do it by force. [end recording]

  [Text] Discussions on the future national police force 
issue wound up at the Lusaka peace talks yesterday. Today the 
negotiators were expected to start discussing national 
reconciliation. Joao Ligio, our correspondent in the Zambian 
capital, reports by telephone: 
  [Begin Ligio recording] The second point of the second round 
of the Lusaka peace talks has entered its embryonic stage. The 
mediator and the troika of observers are working together on the 
general principles that have been presented by both sides as a 
first attempt to narrow differences. 
  Similarly to what has happened when other points have been 
discussed, frightening and disparate demands will become a 
document in line with the constitution in force in this country. 
This is what the troika of observers and sources close to the 
mediation have said. UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin 
Beye held a news conference. Blondin Beye announced that he 
will be leaving for Abidjan tomorrow to attend the funeral of 
the late Ivorian President Felix Houphouet-Boigny. He added 
that proceedings will continue to follow their normal course 
during his absence. 
  Asked about negotiation delays, Beye blamed the negotiators 
and said that everything that takes place in Lusaka will 
ultimately lead to the reintegration of National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola, UNITA, men into Angolan society. 
The Lusaka talks will not veer from what is recognized in the 
Constitution. They are creating a mechanism to increase trust 
(?between Angolans and the mediators). 
  The proverb says that persistence pays and that is borne out 
by facts. After much insistence, UN Special Representative 
Blondin Beye made an exception and broke his information 
blackout [preceding word in English] [words indistinct] a 
plenary meeting with all those participating in the talks so 
that the media could get pictures. Silence greeted reporters 
again, however, shortly after the introductory speech. [end

  [Text] The Angolan peace talks are continuing in Lusaka. 
Having resolved the question of the national police force, the 
two sides are now discussing national reconciliation. UNITA 
says the important thing is the decentralization of power. Its 
spokesman, Jorge Valentim, has demanded important government 
ministries for the organisation: 
  [Begin Valentim recording] If the people are really to 
believe that we are advancing towards national reconciliation, 
it is necessary that we be placed in charge of significant 
ministries. I think that the government is revising its 
attitude. And if this proves to be the case, it will be a 
positive development. Besides, 1994 is not 1992. We have 
evolved, all of us. So we shall come to an agreement, as we 
have done with regard to the army and the police. [end recording]

  [Text] A significant step was taken this afternoon in 
Lusaka, where the government and the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] reached an agreement on the 
delicate issue of the formation of the national police force. 
The agreement, which provides for UNITA's participation in the 
police force, was enthusiastically hailed by the negotiators. A 
source close to the talks told the REUTERS agency that this is 
extremely important because the agreement reached was not on a 
police for the government, nor UNITA, but a police force for the 
Angolans. The agreement provides for the new Angolan police 
force to consist of 26,700 members, of whom 5,500 from UNITA, 
namely 180 officers, 550 noncommissioned officers, and 4,770 
policemen. The next issue to be discussed is national 
reconciliation.

  [Text] Joaquim Chissano, president of the Republic of 
Mozambique, arrived in Luanda this morning for a 24-hour visit 
to Angola. The president of the Republic of Mozambique arrived 
in Luanda at about 0800 aboard an Angolan Airlines aircraft. 
  Joaquim Chissano, who is coming from Portugal, was welcomed 
by President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos. Prime 
Minister Marcolino Moco and members of the government and the 
president's office were also present at the 4 February 
International Airport to welcome the Mozambican head of state. 
  After protocol formalities at the 4 February International 
Airport, the two heads of state left in a motorcade to the 
Futungo de Belas Palace, where they held official talks at the 
highest level. The two delegations exchanged information on the 
political and military situations in their respective countries. 
Angola is facing a war that was caused by the National Union 
for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], which lost the 
first multiparty elections held in September 1992. Mozambique 
is implementing the General Peace Accord signed between the 
government and the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] in 
October 1992. Difficulties faced by the two sides in confining 
troops have led to mutual accusations of the violation of the 
accords. Elections are scheduled to take place in Mozambique in 
October this year. 
  The two heads of state also took the opportunity to review 
the general situation in southern Africa where their countries 
are situated, particularly the development of events in South 
Africa, where the first multiracial elections will take place in 
April this year. 
  Almiro de Conceicao, spokesman for the president of the 
Republic, briefed the press on the talks. 
  [Begin Conceicao recording] The meeting between the two 
presidents was principally aimed at exchanging experience. They 
examined the main issues facing the countries of the region in 
the military, social, political, economic, and financial fields. 
They also discussed some international issues. Evidently, the 
Mozambican side wanted to know how the pacification process took 
place in Angola with regard to the confinement and the formation 
of the armed forces. It also wanted to know about the role 
played by the United Nations in monitoring troops' 
demobilization. Above all, it wanted to know how UNITA had the 
capacity to resume armed conflict after elections. [end 
recording] 
  This afternoon, President Joaquim Chissano met with Angolan 
Prime Minister Marcolino Moco. Prime Minister Marcolino Moco 
was accompanied by the government's economic team. They related 
their experiences with the economic readjustment programs in 
their respective countries. The Angolan Government is preparing 
an economic program for 1994, and Mozambique's experience seems 
to be useful. In turn, Mozambique is experiencing an atmosphere 
of preelectoral campaigning, and the Angolan experience serves 
as a barometer for the measures adopted by the Mozambican 
Government. President Joaquim Chissano is presently being 
honored with an official dinner given by President Jose Eduardo 
dos Santos. The Mozambican head of state will give a news 
conference before leaving Luanda tomorrow.

murdered 203 people in the area of Santa Eulalia, Bengo 
Province, on 11 January. Those people were killed simply 
because they were National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola, UNITA, sympathizers. According to our correspondent in 
that area, women were brutally raped and the men were killed. 
  Also in Bengo Province, MiG-23 combat fighters have bombed 
the areas of Pangualuquene, Quibaxe, Piri, Nambuangongo, and 
Quibaco, killing 125 people, wounding another 84, and destroying 
seven homes. 
  The following is the balance of MPLA-PT atrocities against

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] International mediators between the two factions in 
the Lesotho army appeared to have brokered a final peace deal 
today. After more than two weeks of tension and clashes between 
them, mediators from the subregion and from the Commonwealth 
have been trying to get the mutineers to hand over unauthorized 
weapons. Today, there was an exchange of weapons in Maseru. 
Journalist Mamelo Maurisini was there. On the line, Audrey 
Brown asked her how it went. 
  [Begin recording] [Maurisini] At two o'clock our time, the 
traffic came to a standstill in Kings Way as armored vehicles 
traveled down Kings Way, with soldiers waving white flags, 
moving toward the headquarters barracks. 
  [Brown] And what were these soldiers going to go and do 
there? 
  [Maurisini] According to the information that the 
Commonwealth team had given us, the purpose of the soldiers 
going to the barracks was to go and hand in all heavy weaponry 
in order to get ready for talks with government, as soon as all 
heavy weaponry had been returned to the armories. 
  [Brown] So these soldiers who were handing in the armory, 
were they the rebels? 
  [Maurisini] There are no rebels, as far as the government 
and 
as far as Basotho are concerned. It was both sides of the army. 
The army at Makoanyane and the army at the headquarters. 
  [Brown] So, they were giving in the weapons that they used 
to 
shoot each other with and to attack each other within the last 
couple of weeks? 
  [Maurisini] Yes, that is what was happening. They were 
beginning their descent from the mountain at the same points 
where they had been keeping watch over the last two and half 
weeks. 
  [Brown] So, these weapons that they were handing back, were 
they weapons that had been looted from the head office's arsenal? 
  [Maurisini] The Commonwealth observer team assured us that 
all weapons had been signed out and that it would be easy for 
them to be returned, because they were going to be signed in, 
depending on the register of what had been taken out. 
  [Brown] So, please, just clarify [words indistinct]. So, the 
army was actually giving weapons back to the army? 
  [Maurisini] The army was returning the weapons to the 
armories, and we had been made to believe that two British 
captains attached to the Royal Lesotho Defense Force would 
monitor this handing in at the two barracks. 
  [Brown] So, the weapons that they were giving back, these 
weapons, they say, were legitimately signed out and used to 
attack each other. Is that what had happened? And these 
weapons were now being given back? 
  [Maurisini] The weapons had been legitimately taken out, the 
Commonwealth observer team says, but we have no proof that it 
was as they had said. But we have no reason to doubt that they 
had been legitimately signed out, as the two sides were getting 
ready for a final showdown. Now, it was all this extra armories 
that they were returning into the armories and they would be 
remaining with one firearm each, as is normal. 
  [Brown] So, is everyone satisfied with the way the whole 
process went? 
  [Maurisini] The people are satisfied because, as far as I 
could judge, there was ululation, there was cheering, and they 
were singing as the soldiers went down Kings Way in the company 
of members of the diplomatic corps and religious leaders. I 
would like to believe that everybody, including the Commonwealth 
team, are happy with the process this far. The major problem, 
of course, will be whether, after the army has been brought 
together by the Commonwealth team, the government will now be 
willing to talk. [end recording]

  [Text] Maseru residents were jubilant today as they 
witnessed the pulling out and the moving of artillery by 
soldiers from their positions on the hill overlooking the city 
as the first step toward solving the present military crisis. 
  The soldiers' armored cars had white flags symbolizing 
peace, 
and the movement of the artillery from the hill to the (Ha 
Rakamose) Army Base was monitored by the Commonwealth special 
envoys, diplomatic staff, and church leaders. 
  Speaking to the media, an army officer, Lieutenant 
(Malefetsane Mabuluka), said the army has made a concession 
regarding their previous demand for a 100 percent salary 
increase. He said they will accept any reasonable increase the 
government will make but appealed it should be in line with the 
present rate of inflation in the country. 
  In his brief remarks at both Makoanyane and (Ha Rakamose) 
Barracks the honorable minister of foreign affairs, Mr. Molapo 
Xhobela, said he will inform his majesty King Letsie III and the 
right honorable the prime minister, Dr. Ntsu Mokhehle, that the 
mission toward the rebuilding of peace and hope in the country 
has been accomplished. The minister also commended both 
factions of the country's defense force for agreeing to lay down 
their arms saying it is an encouraging step in the direction of 
peace and tranquility in the country.

<F P=106> [Article by Naftal Donaldo] </F>
  [Excerpts] DOMINGO has found that there are good relations 
between Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] soldiers and the 
UN Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz] military observers at the 
assembly areas of Neves and Chipandzane, in Inhambane Province, 
and Changanine, in Gaza Province. The Renamo men have been 
gradually handing over their weapons to the officials in the 
Unomoz peacekeeping mission. 
  DOMINGO interviewed Renamo liaison officers in the three 
assembly areas in the area of jurisdiction of the Southern 
Regional Command, and it found that there is mutual trust 
between the Renamo forces and the "blue helmets" who have been 
deployed at those centers. 
  Major Aurelio de Freitas and officer Meque Nyumba, of the 
Renamo command for Neves assembly area, noted that good 
Renamo-UN relations also extend to the civilian component. 
  To back up their statements, Freitas and Nyumba explained 
that, from a comparatively small group of 50 men, the number of 
soldiers increased to more than 200 in only a matter of days. 
  In addition, the health post set up by the peacekeeping 
mission has been assisting the people who live in the vicinity 
and who are under Renamo's control. 
  This climate of trust is further enhanced by the fact that, 
as the soldiers receive orders from their Maringue headquarters 
to move to Neves and present themselves for registration, the 
process of disarmament and collection of war materiel is 
accompanied by the distribution of the goods to which they are 
entitled. In concrete terms, those goods are food and clothing 
that is distributed to individuals or to groups of men. [passage 
omitted] 
  Freitas and Nyumba confirmed that each one of the soldiers 
under their command had received the quantities of food set by 
the World Food Program, WFP. Those foodstuffs included corn, 
rice, beans, peas, cooking oil, sugar, and salt. [passage 
omitted] 
  Good relations between Renamo and Unomoz were also confirmed 
by Captain Cassama, a Guinea-Bissau observer in the UN 
peacekeeping force. Major Sven Kallstrom, a Swedish major in 
the Unomoz forces, also confirmed that relations were good, 
though he avoided going into details for reasons that have to do 
with ethics and internal regulations. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 1 SAPA--State President F W de 
Klerk heads the National Party's [NP] list of candidates for the 
PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region in the 
national assembly, according to the party's lists released on 
Wednesday. 
  The top 10 names on the national assembly candidates list 
feature cabinet members Pik Botha, Roelf Meyer, Sam de Beer, 
Leon Wessels, Derek Keys, Jac Rabie and Piet Welgemoed. Deputy 
Ministers Theo Alant, Fanus Schoeman and Sheila Camerer are 
among the first 15. Two senior ministers on the national lists 
have opted to also be on the provincial lists--Kobie Coetsee and 
Amie Venter. 
  Senior ministers who have opted for election to the national 
assembly include Dawie de Villiers (Western Cape), Kobie Coetsee 
([Orange] Free State), Danie Schutte (Natal) and Amie Venter 
(northwest). 
  Those topping the other regional national assembly lists 
include Tobie Meyer (Eastern Cape), Keppies Niemann (Northern 
Cape) and Chris Fismer (Eastern Transvaal). 
  Senior ministers topping the lists for regional governments 
include Hernus Kriel (Western Cape), George Bartlett (Natal), 
Tertius Delport (Eastern Cape) and Kraai van Niekerk (Northern 
Cape). 
  In releasing the names, State President de Klerk said the 
lists were "reasonably representative" of South Africa's 
population groups as well as of both sexes. 
  Two provincial NP leaders said in statements that 
intimidation had played a role in reducing the number of blacks 
on the lists. Cape leader Dawie de Villiers said there were 
various Xhosa-speaking members of the party who were coerced by 
the current climate of violence and intimidation into 
withholding their candidature so as not to jeopardise their 
families' safety. This disturbing state of affairs had cast a 
shadow over the election. 
  Natal leader George Bartlett said the party would have 
wished 
to have a greater number of black candidates, but fear of 
intimidation and an atmosphere of intolerance had a serious 
inhibiting effect.

destroys any hope of a peaceful and inclusive election. The 
DP's chairman, Mr. Ken Andrew, said in a statement that 
regional-based parties were entitled to oppose a single ballot 
paper because this could seriously harm their election 
prospects. Mr. Andrew said that the ANC and the NP should 
realize that South Africa's future was more important than 
attempts to win a few extra votes.

  [Text] State President F.W. de Klerk has announced a 
comprehensive plan to stabilize the violence-wrecked East Rand 
and restore order to the area. The five-point plan is a joint 
initiative by President de Klerk and ANC [African National 
Congress] leader Nelson Mandela, as well as other political 
leaders. 
  The South African Defense Force will be deployed in the area 
immediately, and the Internal Stability Unit withdrawn. A 
representative task group led by the former chief of the Air 
Force, General Jan van Loggrenberg, will be in control of the 
operation. The task group will also include members of the ANC, 
the NP [National Party], and the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], as 
well as community, business, and church leaders. 
  The plan includes the upgrading and provision of community 
services and the support and protection of people of all 
political persuasions who were forced to evacuate their homes 
because of the violence. Urgent steps will also be taken to 
restore clean administration and good government to the area. 
  The five-point plan was approved by the Transitional 
Executive Council during its weekly sitting in Pretoria today. 
President de Klerk said in a statement that the plan was aimed 
at restoring stability and trust in the East Rand as soon as 
possible. Urgent attention will also be given to health 
conditions, the upgrading of hostels, and teaching in the area.

  [Text] Pretoria Feb 1 SAPA--State President F W de Klerk 
announced details of the East Rand peace plan on Tuesday [1 
February] afternoon but warned there was no quick fix to the 
area's problems. The peace blueprint is a major joint 
initiative, planning for which took place in conjunction with 
African National Congress [ANC] President Nelson Mandela and the 
Transitional Executive Council. 
  It involves the withdrawal of the SA Police's Internal 
Stability Division [ISD] and its replacement with a contingent 
of SA Defence Force [SADF] troops. 
  In a statement, Mr de Klerk said 80 percent of all deaths 
due 
to political violence in the country in the past eight months 
had taken place on the East Rand. Socio-economic conditions 
were desperate and people lived in daily fear of losing their 
lives. 
  Mr de Klerk announced the formation of a task group to be 
headed by the former head of the SA Air Force, Gen Jan van 
Loggerenberg. 
  The task group would be responsible for initiatives to 
restore and upgrade community services, to establish stability, 
to assist persons displaced from their homes and to restore 
sound administration. 
  "The first task that we all face is the urgent need to re- 
establish stability in the East Rand. Failure to do so will 
amount to callous disregard of the misery of almost one million 
South Africans. It will also have negative consequences for the 
prospect of a free and fair election in April. I have 
accordingly instructed the deployment of the SADF in the area 
with immediate effect. This will correspond with the withdrawal 
of the ISD from the area as well as creating the conditions 
necessary for an increased role for the SAP [South African 
Police] within a framework of community-oriented policing," Mr 
de Klerk said. 
  "Special efforts will be made to achieve improved relations 
between the SAP and the community," he said. "There have already 
been signals from affected communities that the SADF will be 
recognised for its role and, accordingly, welcomed into the 
community." 
  However, he warned the initiatives would take some time to 
bear fruit. "It must be clearly stated that it will not be 
possible to undertake and implement all the above in the 
immediate and short-term period. Many of these programmes will 
require a much longer time frame for their successful 
implementation. While much can and will be done to immediately 
improve the daily lives of the residents, there is no quick fix 
for the East Rand. 
  "At the same time this plan is aimed at rapidly bringing 
stability, hope and confidence to the people ravaged by violence 
and instilling confidence in the future." 
  Mr de Klerk said the task group would interact with 
different 
socio-economic upliftment forums.

  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 1 SAPA -- African National Congress 
[ANC] President Nelson Mandela has welcomed the proposed East 
Rand peace plan announced by State President F W de Klerk on 
Tuesday [1 February]. Addressing about 500 supporters in the D H 
Williams recreation centre in Katlehong, Mr Mandela said he had 
cancelled a two-day visit to the Angolan capital Luanda because 
of the urgency of the situation on the East Rand. [words 
indistinct] "I have asked for that meeting to be postponed 
because of the implication of the meeting I am attending." Mr 
Mandela would have met with Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos 
and Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano in Luanda. 
  Mr Mandela said "this (peace) plan is intended to save lives 
here and bring about stability in the region". The announcement 
of the withdrawal of the Internal Stability Division [ISD] in 
the area drew thunderous cheers from the crowd. Mr Mandela said 
the ISD withdrawal would be welcomed by all. 
  In reply to a question whether the move would not be opposed 
by mainly Zulu-speaking hostel residents, Mr Mandela said: "I 
think they are the only people who would like the ISU [Internal 
Stability Unit] to remain in the area. The rest do not want the 
ISU to remain here even for a day," Mr Mandela said to the 
approval of the crowd. 
  He urged the Inkatha Freedom Party to involve itself in the 
peace plan and repeated an invitation to the party to send a 
representative to participate in the appointed task group formed 
to oversee the peace process. 
  Regarding the violence in Natal, Mr Mandela said: "We have 
embarked on a number of strategies to formulate means to stop 
violence." 
  The ANC leader told supporters it would be improper for him 
to be seen announcing the peace plan from the Union Buildings in 
Pretoria and that it had to be seen to be done in the area 
plagued by the violence. Regarding Mr de Klerk's absence at the 
announcement of the plan in Katlehong, Mr Mandela said: "His 
diary would not allow it." 
  Mr de Klerk released details of the peace plan to the media 
at 4PM on Tuesday while Mr Mandela made the announcement 
simultaneously at the community centre in Katlehong. 
  The statement issued by Mr de Klerk was read to the audience 
by the Transitional Executive Council member Mac Maharaj who 
visited the area recently to investigate the situation. 
  Mr Mandela said the East Rand was responsible for 80 per 
cent 
of the national total of victims of violence.

  [Excerpts] The long-awaited peace plan aimed at restoring 
normality to the violence-wrecked East Rand townships has 
finally been announced. The peace initiative was devised by 
State President F.W. de Klerk and ANC [African National 
Congress] leader Nelson Mandela in conjunction with the 
Transitional Executive Council. [passage omitted] 
  But the peace plan already seems to have hit a snag. In his 
statement Mr. de Klerk said discussions between himself and IFP 
[Inkatha Freedom Party] leader, Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, had 
secured the IFP's involvement in the peace plan. But in a 
strongly-worded statement the IFP has rejected the initiative. 
It has described the withdrawal of the Internal Stability Units 
as a treacherous betrayal of government undertakings.

  [Text] ANC [African National Congress] leaders have 
gathered for a special meeting in Johannesburg to assess the 
latest deadlock in constitutional talks. Talks between the 
government, the ANC, and the Freedom Alliance reached a deadlock 
in Pretoria last night. 
  ANC Chairman Thabo Mbeki said that he would take right-wing 
proposals for constitutional amendments to the 26-member 
National Working Committee today. 
  Meanwhile ANC media spokesman Carl Niehaus has said that the 
organization does not fear outright civil war. He was 
commenting on remarks by Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] 
co-leader General Constand Viljoen in an SABC [South African 
Broadcasting Corporation] television interview last night. Gen. 
Viljoen said that an uprising could be unavoidable if a 
volkstaat [homeland] was not proclaimed before the election.

  [Text] Pretoria Feb 1 SAPA--The Afrikaner Volksfront 
[National Front--AVF] said on Tuesday it was shocked by reports 
from "reliable sources" that a large segment of the National 
Peacekeeping Force [NPF] had been heard to chant "Kill the Boer, 
Kill the Farmer" at their De Brug base on Saturday night. 
  AVF Press Secretary Stephen Maninger said the NPF 
represented 
the re-emergence of the African National Congress' [ANC] armed 
wing Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation], and could not be 
trusted with the safety of the South African public. 
  The NPF was not apolitical, and was ill-disciplined and 
unreliable, he said. "We predict that once this force is 
deployed it may become South Africa's version of (Zimbabwe 
President Robert) Mugabe's `5th Brigade,' sent to suppress all 
political opposition in places such as kwaZulu or other areas 
where the ANC does not have complete control." 
  The AVF statement was referred to the Transitional Executive 
Council's sub-council on defence for comment.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Criticism of Mandela `Attack' on Police--Johannesburg THE 
STAR in English on 2 February in a page-4 editorial commends 
African National Congress (ANC) President Nelson Mandela's 
pledge to restructure the police force so that it can be more 
effective in combating crime. However, his "attack on the 
police for being `part of the problem' merely skirts the issue 
of current legitimacy and the ability of the force to deal with 
crime. Couched in electioneering rhetoric, Mandela's call for a 
more efficient force was short on both detail and consistency." 
"Granted, the police force needs to be transformed into one 
serving all sections of society fairly and equally. But its 
task is made more difficult when it is being vilified by 
important leaders such as Mandela." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Criticism of ANC Resisting Double Ballot--"The ANC's 
rationale for resisting a double ballot is facile," declares a 
page-6 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 2 
February. Its leaders say "it is based on the experience of a 
few voter education exercises which showed that about 30 percent 
of people voted for their second preference party in the second 
ballot. Some believe the ANC fears losing regional votes to 
smaller parties. This shows a paternalistic disrespect for 
either voters' freedom of choice or their intelligence." "The 
ANC's hard line on this issue negates many of the statesmanlike 
concessions made on other issues. Unless it yields, the ANC will 
rue its folly." 
<H6>  BEELD </H6>
  Gaborone Meeting Marks Country's Acceptance--Johannesburg 
BEELD in Afrikaans on 28 January notes in a page-8 editorial: 
"The meeting in Gaborone between President F.W. de Klerk and 
President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe completed a remarkable 
diplomatic circle. The moment when South Africa's formerly 
hostile neighbor extended his hand to President de Klerk it 
finally signalled South Africa's complete reacceptance into the 
international community. The fact that it was Mr. de Klerk who 
shook Mr. Mugabe's hand says a lot. After all, it was a National 
Party government which took South Africa into the political 
wilderness." "The Gaborone meeting ought to sound the death 
knell for the so-called Frontline States" and "lead to a new 
line, with South Africa at the head, forming a front against 
stagnation, economic collapse, and political violence." "South 
Africans can indeed look forward to exciting times ahead, 
provided no one forgets how easy it is to destroy everything 
through faulty politics." 
  Right Wing Needs To Promote Cause--In his "Political BEELD" 
column on page 8, Willie Kuhn points out: "Two reports this 
week confirm how dramatically South Africa has changed in the 
last few years. First, the ANC and the Orange Free State 
Agricultural Union held a meeting," and later the union's 
spokesman Mr. Pieter Gous said they "could not ignore the fact 
that the ANC is an important factor in the province, and that 
the two major forces in the province had spoken with one 
another. Second, Transvaal Agricultural Union Chairman Dries 
Bruwer, who is also a Conservative Party [CP] MP said the 
farmers and the ANC had almost reached agreement on a homeland." 
"The right-wingers are in fact following in the steps of the 
National Party [NP]. The NP's first meetings with the ANC were 
also initially through moderates like Mr. Thabo Mbeki, but 
eventually they met face to face with the Joe Slovos and Joe 
Modises, and thus began the negotiations. So now it is only the 
Afrikaner Resistance Movement, and those to the right of them, 
who refuse to talk with the ANC. But then the resistance 
movement have always been a moth eaten lot." "Once the various 
forces in the country identify, recognize and respect one 
another, negotiations begin to take on a live-and-let-live 
approach. That is what happened to the NP, and what is now 
happening to the CP and the right-wing agricultural unions." 
Kuhn concludes: "If the right wing could drop their racism, 
prejudices, and fears like the NP did, they could become part of 
a larger group of participants sharing the same principles. By 
becoming a full part of the negotiations and election process, 
they could, with credibility, legitimacy, as well as a larger 
platform, begin to promote the cause of an Afrikaner homeland." 
  Right Wing Wants War, Not Settlement--An editorial on page 8 
of Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 31 January notes that: 
"While South Africa is involved in a heated election campaign, 
it is also in the midst of a potential war situation. The 
latter was confirmed by the obstinacy of the right-wingers who 
gathered in Pretoria at the weekend to establish a `transitional 
assembly' and a `transitional parliament.' A large part of the 
`assembly' viewed continued negotiations as treason. In the 
process General Constand Viljoen was humiliated, and lumped 
together with the National Party which opted for the path of 
negotiation. Yesterday's hero can quickly become today's 
political traitor in a movement which treats issues so 
emotionally. It is difficult to see how Gen. Viljoen can 
continue his prominent role within the Afrikaner National Front. 
He, the militarist, suffered strategic defeat at the hands of 
politicians and their followers." BEELD continues: "We have 
long felt that the foremost political leaders on the right are 
not interested in a settlement, only in war. They viewed Gen. 
Viljoen as a vehicle, and when it seemed he would not storm 
blindly ahead, he had to be sacrificed in public."

  [Text] Sardasht, W. Azarbaijan Prov. Feb. 2, IRNA -- The 
Turkish delegation headed by the Turkish Foreign Ministry 
official, Ogur Dugan, visited two villages in 'Qassemrash' 
region here Tuesday. 
  The delegation is currently here to meet families of the 
victims of the last Friday [28 January] air strike of Turkish 
jet fighters against two Iranian border villages. 
  While inspecting the villages, Dugan expressed deep regret 
over the incident and stressed that the attack had been 
unintentional. 
  The delegation, arrived in Orumiyeh, the provincial capital, 
last Monday, also took photographs of unexploded bombs and 
rockets fired by the Turkish warplanes. The delegation was 
accompanied by a number of Turkish military experts. 
  One of the villagers whose wife had been injured in the 
incident, argued why the Turkish Government had bombed Iranian 
border villages and farmers. 
  In response Dugan said Ankara and Tehran were two friendly 
countries, adding that Turkey would convince Iran it had no 
intention to attack the villages. 
  As a result of the air strike of Turkish warplanes last 
Friday, nine villagers were killed and 19 others wounded in 
Qassemrash region. 
  The delegation has so far visited a number of wounded 
villagers hospitalized in Orumiyeh.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Dr. Velayati met the Bulgarian 
prime minister in Sofia last night. Lyuben Berov described 
Velayati's visit to Bulgaria as a turning point for improving 
and strengthening the bases of bilateral relations. He stressed 
his government's eagerness to increase commercial exchanges with 
Iran.

grateful that President Hashemi-Rafsanjani was safe following 
yesterday's shooting incident at the mausoleum of the imam, may 
God be pleased with him.

  [Text] Following the plot by a limited number of 
counterrevolutionaries on Tuesday who had congregated in one of 
the streets in Zahedan and intended to create agitation and 
disturbances, the Secretariat of the Supreme National Security 
Council issued a statement last night, the text of which is as 
follows: 
  A number of elements who--in the course of the measures 
taken 
by the security forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the 
eastern border areas of the country--perceived that they could 
attain their lost interests congregated in one of the streets in 
Zahedan. They broke the windows of some residential buildings 
and damaged some vehicles passing on the streets, including 
those of the law enforcement forces. In performing their 
legitimate duties and in order to restore law and order, the law 
enforcement forces therefore intervened and began dispersing 
these people and arresting the disruptive elements.

<F P=106> [Commentary by the News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>
  [Text] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. 
  The vigilant people know that the enemies of the Islamic 
revolution have always been apprehensive about the Muslim 
nation's presence on the scene, especially during the Ten Days 
of Dawn, the symbol of the greatness and grandeur of Islam and 
the people of Iran. At various times, they have sought to 
neutralize or undermine this action. 
  The incident at the mausoleum of the imam, may God be 
pleased 
with him, proved that during the festivities to mark the victory 
of the Islamic revolution, the powers of world arrogance and the 
enemies of the Islamic revolution intend to stage incidents to 
disrupt the popular activity. 
  What we witnessed yesterday affirms the vigilance and 
alertness of the people, who, for the past 15 years, have 
maintained an active presence on the scene of the defense of the 
Islamic revolution and on the line of the late imam. The 
people's slogans following the random shooting at the sacred 
precincts of the [mausoleum of] the Islamic revolution's founder 
indicate that the plots of the enemies of Islam and the Islamic 
revolution are ineffective and constitute a declaration of 
allegiance to the system of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  Everyone should know, at this critical time for the Islamic 
revolution and the country's construction, when the enemies' 
hopes are being turned into despondency, that only vigilance and 
alertness and knowledgeable action can steer the Islamic 
revolution toward its lofty goals. 
  Everyone should know that the powers of world arrogance fear 
the Ten Days of Dawn and the celebration of the Day of God 
[Yawm- Allah] on 11 February. The 11 February marches have 
already perturbed the Islamic revolution's enemies. This year, 
as in previous years, the people will again display their 
unified presence at the 11 February marches and reaffirm their 
unwavering determination to safeguard the revolution's gains--to 
the chagrin of their enemies.

<F P=106> [Report by Laurent Maillard] </F>
  [Text] Tehran, Feb 2 (AFP)--Several people were injured and 
others arrested in a rare outburst of sectarian violence in 
southeast Iran, marring celebrations for the 15th anniversary of 
the Islamic republic, newspapers said Wednesday. 
  The protest on Tuesday came the same day as a gunman fired 
shots during a speech by President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani. 
  And the mainly Shiite Muslim country's economic plight also 
cast a shadow over the anniversary when parliament cut the 
annual budget. 
  An angry crowd gathered Tuesday outside the main mosque in 
Zahedan, one of the few Iranian cities with a Sunni Muslim 
majority, after rumours spread that a Sunni mosque had been 
destroyed in Mashhad in northeastern Iran. 
  "Counter-revolutionary elements joined the crowd and started 
throwing stones at the police, breaking shop windows," HAMSHARI 
newspaper said. 
  The interior ministry described the violence as a "counter- 
revolutionary plot" and said public buildings, houses and 
military vehicles had been attacked. 
  The security forces arrested demonstrators who wanted to 
"sow 
disorder and trouble in Zahedan" at the start of the official 
ceremonies marking the anniversary of the 1979 revolution which 
toppled the shah, the ministry said. 
  No figure was given for the number of demonstrators 
involved. 
  "Counter-revolutionary elements gathered in Khayyam Avenue 
and began ripping down the Iranian flags and smashing the party 
lights decorating the street for the anniversary of the 
revolution," the ministry said. 
  The newspaper KEYHAN reported Tuesday that the armed 
opposition group the People's Mojahedin [Mojahedin-e Khalq 
Organization, MKO] was preparing "terrorist activities" in 
Sistan va Baluchestan province, of which Zahedan is the main 
town, "with the backing of Saudi Arabia," which sees itself as 
the leader of the Sunni branch of Islam. 
  Also Tuesday, a gunman fired shots as Rafsanjani delivered a 
speech at the mausoleum of the republic's founder, Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeyni. Police arrested a 26-year-old man who said 
he had only wanted to frighten the crowd. 
  Rafsanjani, standing 50 meters (yards) away and shielded by 
an aide, kept his composure and did not interrupt his speech at 
the shrine in southern Tehran. "There was nothing to worry 
about," he told Tehran Radio later. 
  The noise panicked some in the crowd of several thousand who 
had gathered to celebrate the first of the 10 days which led to 
the revolution, known here as "Fajr" (dawn). 
  After the incident the crowd started shouting "Rafsanjani, 
we 
support you" and "death to the hypocrites," in reference to the 
armed opposition. On the economic front, the Iranian 
parliament adopted an austerity budget for 1994-1995, trimming 
the government's proposed draft by 12 percent because of low oil 
revenues. 
  Parliament lowered the forecast for overall revenues to 17 
billion dollars, down from the government's target of 19.2 
billion dollars. The budget was cut by 12 percent, from 45.5 
billion dollars to 40 billion dollars. 
  MPs also chopped 20 percent off the revenue forecast from 
oil 
exports for the next Iranian year -- running from March 21, 1994 
to March 20, 1995 -- from 12.8 billion dollars to 10.15 billion 
dollars. 
  The price of a barrel of crude was estimated at 13 dollars, 
while the government had forecast 14.5 dollars.

  [Text] The national budget bill for the year 1373 
[beginning in March 1994] passed its first reading by the Majles 
deputies following their approval of the total government 
revenues. 
  According to a report by the Central News Unit, the single 
article of the bill was approved in today's open session of the 
Majles and in its first reading. 
  Next year's budget, in terms of revenues and funds provided 
from other sources, as well as expenditures and costs, is 
69,772,752,907,000 rials. The general state budget, in terms of 
revenues and expenditures, is 32,303,350,987,000 rials. 
  According to the bill, the general revenue and funds 
provided 
from other sources are 30,048,946,179,000 rials, the special 
income from ministries and state organizations 2,254,404,808,000 
rials and the budget for state organization, banks, and state 
affiliated nonprofit organizations, in terms of income and funds 
provided from other sources is 45.4539 trillion rials. 
  According to the approved single article, should there be an 
increase in the foreign currency oil sale income from $10.1543 
billion to $11.840 billion, the extra income will be spent on 
the repayment of the country's foreign currency commitments, and 
the surplus will be spent on projects indicated in the bill and 
to cover shortage of credit in development plans. 
  The spokesman for the Majles commission on plans and budget 
explained the changes in the budget bill and said: in comparison 
to the bill presented by the government, the national budget has 
been decreased by some 10 trillion rials, while the general 
budget has been decreased by 3.7 trillion rials, and the gross 
change that must be kept in mind during the second reading is 
about 2.22 billion rials. 
  At the beginning of the open Majles session this afternoon, 
deputy speaker Hasan Rowhani, who was in the seat of the 
speaker, congratulated the deputies on the anniversary of the 
return of the Imam Khomeyni to the Islamic motherland on 1 
February 1979 and spoke of this day as an unforgettable holy day. 
  Mr. Hasan Rowhani referred to the various plots by the world 
arrogant powers in creating confusion among the ever-vigilant 
people of the country and pointed to the shooting incident this 
morning at the start of the sacred 10 Days of Dawn ceremonies in 
the pure shrine of his excellency, the imam. 
  He said: in a naive illusion and a childish move and by 
firing several aimless shots into the air, the enemy imagined he 
could disperse the people and disrupt the festivities marking 
the 16th spring of freedom. 
  He emphasized: Such actions will definitely be to the loss 
of 
the enemy, and our people will not change their ways because of 
such childish acts. They will continue to participate, actively 
and with better spirit, in the festivities and other fields of 
revolution.

<F P=106> [First Friday prayers sermon by Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, </F>
head of the judiciary, in Tehran on 28 January -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. [passage omitted] I would like to indicate another 
point and, in reality, tell you about my own belief and then say 
several sentences on the general deputization [niyabat-e 'ammeh 
-- reference to eminent Shiite religious scholars guiding the 
ummah on behalf of the disappeared imam] 
  I say that the imam of the age, may God hasten his advent, 
who has the responsibility for managing the Shiites -- or the 
Islamic ummah -- is, we say, our 12th Imam. He is alive, 
observant and present. He awaits and is waited for. He will 
spread justice throughout the world by his presence. Perhaps it 
should be said that the Islamic ummah is managed through his 
imamate. Taking into cosideration our Islamic knowledge, it 
must be said that the lives of human beings are connected with 
the existence of the imam. Speaking more carefully on this 
matter, it must be said that the existence of the totality of 
life [jahan-e hasti] is connected with the existence of the 
imam. [passage omitted] 
  Regarding the type of guidance and leadership under the 
conditions of absence [the time during which the 12th imam has 
absented himself], for example in our time, we think that if the 
imam of the age observes that a problem is going to emerge so 
that the foundations of shar'iah -- and under our conditions, 
the foundations of sovereignty -- are threatened he will give 
guidance by any reasoning possible and in any way possible. He 
will correct the mistake. He will guide so that the danger does 
not come about for the Shiites or the Islamic ummah. 
  At the beginning of the great absence we came across a 
problem when a jurisconsult would issue a fatwa [religious 
edict]. Then it would become clear that he has made a mistake 
and the imam of the age would eliminate the mistake even before 
the jurisconsult realized. And then when he did realize he 
would inform him that you do your work; you issue your fatwa; 
you perform your duty and we will perform ours. 
  That is why I tell you that, especially in crucial issues, 
if 
it comes to a point where decisionmaking or action requires 
guidance and the person who actually has the responsibility for 
the ummah has a problem in making a decision or it is difficult 
for him or there is a possibility of making a mistake, then the 
imam [of the age] must come to his aid. We believe that during 
the Islamic revolution in Iran the leader of the revolution, the 
departed imam [Khomeyni], may God Almighty be satisfied with 
him, made use of such guidance time and again; especially in 
crucial and dangerous issues where decisionmaking is most 
difficult. I noted in another session that all of the imam's 
friends -- even the members of the Revolution Council who had 
been appointed by the imam -- wrote to him saying that 
conditions are not right; do not come to Iran. The conditions 
are severe and that is not possible. It is not possible to 
foresee what will happen. He replied forthrightly: I will 
definitely come and if I am to be killed, I should be killed 
among my own people. And when he set foot on the Iranian soil 
and when his face was first sighted from the plane -- take 
careful note of that; I note some meticulous observers have been 
most careful [in this] -- a very deep tranquillity could be 
sensed in the imam. Those who are acquainted with psychological 
matters can read a person's mind from his face. With utmost 
calm as if there was no problem. As if he saw that with his 
coming the victory of the revolution was final and there would 
be no problems either. [passage omitted] 
  In my view and in my belief this issue [Khomeyni's decision 
to come to Iran] is a sign of the so-called divine guidance 
[ershadat-e gheybi] by the imam of the age, God's peace be on 
him, to aid and guide his deputy -- the person who has taken on 
the responsibility -- to the extent that he himself [the imam of 
the age] manages affairs according to principles and there will 
not be any problems. If there is to be an issue that will be to 
the detriment of the umma, his imamate requires that he does not 
abandon his ummah and guides his deputy. [passage omitted] 
  His imamate requires that in the vital issues concerning 
the ummah the deputy must be guided even if it means somehow to 
take over his heart, his thoughts, and his brain. The absence 
does not mean severance; that he has sat in a corner and the 
jurisconsults administer. That is not so. Those jurisconsults 
who take the responsibility of managing are under special 
conditions where they must, so to speak, have that privilege. 
  I have very little time. Nevertheless there are several 
issues that I must tell you, so I'll try to be very concise. 
Let me say something in this same regard. 
  During the absence [of the imam of the age] grand 
jurisconsults became the imam's general deputy and manage the 
ummah. The deputization was given by title; that is the title 
of jurisconsult. And at any time the titles are many and can be 
many. There are jurisconsults. In our time there are many 
jurisconsults and those titles and conditions are true in their 
case. In al-Najaf, in Qom, in Mashhad, in various cities where 
Shiites are present. [passage omitted on history of imamate] 
  Eventually, thanks be to God, all those skirmishes and 
confrontations by jurisconsults and deputies of the 12th Imam 
with the governments came to fruition in our time with the hands 
of the departed imam [Khomeyni] and in reality a government in 
the name of the Islamic Republic of Iran was founded in the name 
of the imam [of the age]]. [passage omitted] 
  When the Islamic government was founded it meant that during 
more than 1,000 years of confrontation with rulers infidelity 
vanished and Islam came. It was not like a dynasty vanishing 
and another dynasty appearing. That is most important. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Islamic Republic of Iran means infidelity vanished in 
the 
government and Islam replaced it. The jurisconsult who has the 
responsibility of sovereignty of Islam is a theologian, a deputy 
of the imam [of the age] and acts according to Islam and must 
observe all the Islamic conditions. He himself is subject to 
Islamic laws and regulations. It is Islam that rules, not the 
individual. Under such circumstances I have a question: If 
during 1,000 years our jurisconsults, our religious scholars 
throughout the Islamic cities used to answer the people's 
religious problems, used to receive the religious tax and spent 
it on religious matters, act in areas that they were allowed to 
act and would say they had no duty in the areas were they could 
not act, and the tyrant rulers used to act at the time of the 
sovereignty of Islam, a jurisconsult somewhere cannot set 
himself up as a judge. [as received] He cannot say that there 
is a judicial system in the Islamic Republic and someone has 
been appointed as its head by the leader and they are 
administering the judicial system, but I am a religious scholar 
and wish to set up a judicial system in Shiraz [capital of Fars 
Province]; I can get involved in matters of jihad and war and 
peace; get involved in collecting tax. 
  My insistence that the conditions before and after the 
establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran have changed and 
differ is for this point. If today grand jurisconsults are 
sources of emulation and issue fatwas, nothing is wrong with 
that. Let them issue fatwas: A particular prayer must be said 
once or three times. That is not crucial, let them issue 
fatwas. What is wrong with that? [passage omitted] 
  But if under the conditions of sovereignty of Islam a 
jurisconsult -- for example in a corner of say this Islamic 
state of Iran -- should say, after the leadership has announced 
that there should not be any ties with such and such country, 
that: he is a jurisconsult and I am a jurisconsult. He is 
talking nonsense when he says there should be no ties! I say 
there should be! The leadership says war must be waged. He 
says: no it should not. The leadership says the government can 
set a tax. The jurisconsult says no it cannot. [passage 
omitted] 
  What will be the result? Will not the result be for Islam to 
vanish and infidelity to come and rule once again? The question 
is one of government, and not one of nongovernmental issue. The 
multiplicity of sources of emulation and grand jurisconsults 
poses no problems for the community. During the life of the 
imam [Khomeyni], also, there were many jurisconsults. Not only 
did none of them interfere in government affairs, but they gave 
support to the government. They used to say that whatever the 
imam says we accept. They either did not interfere in 
government affairs, or they offered support. [passage omitted] 
  I say that the multiplicity of grand jurisconsults for 
sources of emulation is no problem. But multiple sources of 
emulation who seek to somehow confront the leadership, interfere 
in government affairs, involve their fatwas in government 
affairs and undermine the government means once again separating 
politics from religion and a return to some people issuing 
fatwas somewhere and the people acting on their fatwas while 
others are ruling somewhere else according to worldy matters. 
All the 1,000-year troubles of the great religious scholars and 
grand jurisconsults which came to fruition by the hands of the 
departed imam will be destroyed again. I say this must be 
carefully looked into. 
  That is why I say that those jurisconsults who are presented 
as sources of emulation must be aware of the times. They must 
respond to the realities existing in the community. They must 
recognize the friends and foes of the Islamic ummah. They must 
distinguish the plots that the enemies of Islam hatch for Islam 
and the Muslims. That is why the departed imam easily and 
frankly said says that if a jurisconsult does not know the 
issues of the time and is incapable of distinguishing them in 
his view he fails to be a jurisconsult. [passage omitted] 
  That is why when I claim that a lofty jurisconsult, an 
exalted jurisconsult, an administering and adroit jurisconsult, 
a jurisconsult who is aware of today's world of Islam and has 
adequate and complete experience, that is, the exalted leader, 
His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, is at the very least, of the 
same rank as others who are being considered. Of course this 
debate belongs to follow the Grand Ayatollah Araki [chosen to 
replace Grand Ayatollah Golpayegani as a source of emulation], 
may God Almighty preserve him. When I make a claim, this is the 
point I base my claim on. That is, the issue must be judged in 
its totality. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 30, IRNA -- Iran an Ireland have 
decided to expand their mutual relations in political, economic, 
commercial and areas, a foreign ministry source said here Sunday. 
  He said that Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati in his 
visit to Dublin in mid January called for creation of a trade 
balance between the two countries, and encouraged the Irish 
Government to import Iranian oil and non-oil products. 
  According to a memorandum of understanding signed between 
Iran and Ireland on Jan. 13, the Irish government expressed 
readiness to facilitate holding of exclusive exhibitions for the 
Iranian products in that country, he said. 
  The two countries also agreed to cooperate in seismology, 
housing, and urban development areas, and to organize short-term 
courses on urban development. 
  Cooperation in agriculture, livestock, forests and pasture 
sectors as well as joint investments in fisheries, food 
industries, aviation, communications, transport, and exchange of 
university students and instructors, are among the other topics 
agreed between the two countries. 
  Velayati in his two-day visit to Ireland met with President 
Mary Robinson, Premier Albert Reynolds and ministers of foreign 
affairs, agriculture and food, defence, the marine, trade and 
marketing and chairman of foreign affairs committee, Brian 
Lennihan. 
  Issues relevant to the developments in the region including 
the situation in afghanistan, Central Asia, Caucasia, Iraq, the 
Persian Gulf, the Middle East Peace Process, developments in 
Europe especially in the Balkans, unity of the two Irelands and 
unity of Europe were discussed during the meetings.

  [Text] Mohammad-Khan, minister for economic affairs and 
finance, in a meeting with a delegation from the World Bank, 
spoke about the significant and fundamental role of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran in the region. 
  Mohammad-Khan said: The main indexes obtained during the 
first development plan indicate that the country's economy is 
moving toward an organized and programmed economy -- and taking 
into account the world economic recession, Iran enjoys a 
relatively good growth. 
  Referring to the substitution of imports that will reduce 
future foreign currency requirements, he said: With the 
increase in domestic production, there will be a fall in the 
import of petrochemical goods and foods, as well as commodities 
needed by consumer and intermediate industries while the export 
of nonoil goods will increase. 
  Mohammad-Khan also spoke on the policy of privatization and 
said the government intends to sell factories through auction or 
limited partnership with individuals interested in investment 
and management. 
  The minister for economic affairs and finance also spoke on 
Iran's important role of creating positive prospects for 
neighboring countries' economies, as well as creating provisions 
for transport of goods from Iranian ports.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "ABRAR To Join International Media </F>
Network"] 
  [Text] As a result of efforts by the Ministry of Post, 
Telegraph, and Telephones, a general information network will be 
inaugurated in our country during the Ten Days of Dawn [1-10 
February] celebrations. 
  Subscribers to this network will be able to connect to it 
from anywhere inside the country and from abroad by dialing a 
number. 
  Initially, newspaper reports, information on train and 
flight 
schedules, and a telephone directory will be entered in the 
database. 
  The ABRAR newspaper will soon join this network. An informed 
source in the Ministry of Post, Telegraph, and Telephones told 
our correspondent that once this network is operational, 
subscribers will be able to obtain their required information 
within seconds. 
  For example, if a subscriber on the other side of the world 
requires a particular newspaper, he can contact the network and 
obtain the required information within seconds. 
  One of the evening newspapers that is scheduled to join the 
network will be disseminated simultaneously in Tehran and in a 
European country. The informed source said most of the Western 
and some Asian countries have such networks. 
  As for the costs of subscribing to this network, he said 
they 
would be announced later but that they would in any case be low 
and result in a savings of time. 
  The network center will be located in the Shahed 
telecommunications complex, which is at the end of the Kordestan 
Autobahn. 
<H5>  Technical Information </H5>
  IRANPAC: This is a general information network being planned 
for communications among computers and terminals in the country 
and with other networks in the world. The IRANPAC packet 
switching network will be capable of providing reliable, 
precise, effective, and economical connections among the 
information centers. 
<H5>  Different Transmission Speeds </H5>
  By using Random Access Memory processes in the network and 
logical channels, IRANPAC will be capable of a simultaneous 
two-way exchange of information between two subscribers at 
different speeds. 
  How do we gain access to IRANPAC? 
  The following measures should be taken to gain access to 
IRANPAC: 
  Set up a communications line between the network center and 
the subscriber's DTE [Data Terminal Equipment] to obtain data by 
the following means: 
  1. [no subsequent numbers below as published] Private 
communications: The subscriber is linked through a permanent 
line to the nearest packet switching network center via the 
IRANPAC network so that he can be linked to the network without 
any loss of time whenever he likes. Under this arrangement, the 
asynchronous DTE speed of his private line can be 300-1,200 bits 
per second and the synchronous DTE speed can be 4,800-9,600 bits 
per second. 
  To gain access by dialing: Under this method, the subscriber 
uses a preassigned telephone number and calls from any of the 
ports in the network that are closest to the IRANPAC switching 
center and offered to the subscribers. 
  The subscribers can in this manner obtain a Network User 
Identification so that when they call up the IRANPAC network, 
their identification is verified; if they are bona fide 
subscribers, they are connected to the desired address. The 
speed in this case is 1,300 or 1,200-2,400 bits per second.

<F P=106> [By Annie Thomas] </F>
  [Text] Mogadishu, Feb 1 (AFP)--US forces and supporters of 
Somali warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid both appealed for calm here 
Tuesday [1 February], though they were in total disagreement 
about a bloody shooting incident that left at least five Somalis 
dead. 
  A spokesman for General Aidid's Somali National Alliance 
(SNA) said US troops on Monday "deliberately killed innocent 
people" in an unprovoked attack, but the US charge d'affaires, 
Stevenson McIlvaine, said he was "convinced" that Somali gunmen 
had opened fire first. 
  Military spokesman for the US Army and the UN Operation in 
Somalia (UNOSOM II) said the capital had remained calm 
overnight, but there were unconfirmed reports that a young 
Somali had been killed in the evening by American troops in the 
port district. 
  Monday's brief firefight, the bloodiest incident since 
Aidid's militiamen declared a ceasefire last October, took place 
at the crowded Kilometre-4 junction on the busy Afgooye Road in 
southern Mogadishu and left at least five Somalis dead and a 
score of others injured, including women and children. 
  "I am now convinced that the incident started...when two 
Somali gunmen opened fire on the Marines" escorting US liaison 
office personnel to a meeting with SNA reprentatives," McIlvaine 
said Tuesday. "This was a tragic incident," he added. "Some 
people have been hit and should not have been hit." 
  But McIlvaine warned that "this is a sort of terrible 
accident that is going to happen as long as the streets of 
Mogadishu, particularly the streets near the (UN) compound and 
the streets that we use are crowded with gunmen." 
  Among those killed by the marines, who were in a convoy 
including Humvee armoured vehicles mounted with heavy guns, was 
a renowned Somali elder in his 60s, Sabriye Alale Barise, who 
had been walking by on the pavement. 
  The secretary-general of the United Somali Congress-SNA 
(USC- 
SNA), Abdulkarim Ahmed Ali, categorically denied that Somalis 
were the first to open fire. "How could we organise an ambush 
on a crowded street? There was no shooting towards the US 
(troops)," he told AFP on Tuesday. "The US soldier in the first 
car was very nervous, he started shooting... They deliberately 
killed innocent people." 
  Ahmed Ali charged that the soldiers "did it on purpose. This 
is a revenge for what happened on the 3rd of October," when 
Somali gunmen loyal to Aidid killed 18 US troops in a pitched 
battle after the marines mounted a raid to capture Aidid aides. 
After that fight, the SNA declared a ceasefire and the United 
Nations suspended a hunt for Aidid, who had been declared a 
wanted man accused of ordering attacks on UN peacekeepers. 
  "We've asked our people to keep quiet, to hold the 
ceasefire," Ahmed Ali added. "We are doing our best to solve 
Somali problems internally. We will continue to talk with 
everybody." 
  The first secretary at the Ethiopian embassy here, Yemane 
Abadi, who had organised Monday's planned meeting between the US 
officials and the SNA representatives, said he also did not 
think "it was an intended attack" and called it "a tragic 
accident." 
  All sides called for a continued effort to reconcile Somali 
clans, who plunged the country into bloody strife and famine 
after the January 1991 ouster of strongman Mohamed Siad Barre.

  [Text] Contrary to what had been reported, the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] and the 
Luanda government will not begin discussing national 
reconciliation today. The change of program is due to the 
absence of UN Special Representative in Angola Alioune Blondin 
Beye, who leaves for Cote d'Ivoire where he will attend the 
funeral of Cote d'Ivoire President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, who 
passed away on 7 December 1993. UNITA Information Secretary Dr. 
Jorge Alicerces Valentim, who is also attending the Lusaka 
talks, says the sides have decided to discuss a less 
controversial topic. Dr. Valentim says the sides might discuss 
the future role of UN Angola Verification Mission-3. Meanwhile, 
Alioune Blondin Beye is scheduled to return from Yamoussoukro 
after the burial of the historic leader of the Ivorian 
revolution on 7 February. Meanwhile, UNITA and the government 
reached an agreement yesterday on the composition of the 
national police. Dr. Valentim described the agreement as 
important.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb 2, IRNA -- The Iranian Air Force, in 
complete control and fully vigilant, would not allow any 
aggression on Iranian territory, said Air Force Commander 
Brigadier General Mansur Sattari in an interview with the 
English morning daily TEHRAN TIMES today. 
  Speaking to the daily, the top Air Force official referred 
to 
the last Friday's Turkish air assault on Iranian border areas 
and noted that the attack was not aimed at Iranian territory as 
the Islamic Republic forces were in full control of the borders. 
  "It was by mistake that the Turkish missile landed in 
Iranian 
territory and 28 of our citizens were martyred or injured," 
Sattari said, "No Turkish fighter plane entered Iranian 
territory,... The Turkish pilots were not experienced or mature 
enough to avoid the tragedy." 
  The general also denied reports that the Turkish planes 
violated Iran's airspace and said that the recent incident 
occured because Iran's residential areas were too close to the 
borders. 
  Gen. Sattari also stated that the Air Force at the moment 
was 
totally freed from its previous intense dependence on the U.S. 
and that it was not only run by an all-Iranian personnel, but 
also provided educational services to some of the Islamic 
countries. 
  As for the Persian Gulf security, the paper quoted the 
official as saying "we are not appalled by the presence of 
foreign warships in the region, in fact we are fully ready to 
counter any suspicious move and our warplanes are at all times 
guarding the country's airspace." 
  Commenting on the post-war reconstruction of the Air Force, 
he said that the reconstruction had reached completion. The 
goal of self-sufficiency, he said, was now within the reach of 
the Air Force. The Air Force experience in achieving 
self-sufficiency could serve as a model for other governmental 
bodies, he said. 
  Earlier in the day, Sattari visited the Air Force exhibition 
in which the latest achievements of different divisions within 
the Air Force were put on display.

  [Excerpt] The 59th OAU Ministerial Council regular session 
has issued a statement following discussions on the prevailing 
situation in Burundi. The council in its statement stressed 
that the continuing efforts to bring stability to the country 
should continue. Alem Newasea has the details. 
  [Begin Alem recording] In its statement, the council said 
that it had been following the situation in Burundi very keenly 
since the November coup attempt. At the present time, when 
everything possible is being done to solve this problem 
peacefully, some unwanted things are happening in the country to 
disrupt the national reconciliation process and are plunging the 
country into chaos. In the light of new developments, the 
council, in its five point- resolution, reaffirmed its support 
for last year's election results and urged the country's army to 
work faithfully for the benefit of the people by not considering 
people's political affiliations. The council also expressed its 
support for sending an international peacekeeping force and 
observer team to bring peace and stability to Burundi. The 
council expressed its solidarity with the people of Burundi in 
their tribulation. [passage omitted] [end recording]

called on all member states to give additional assistance to 
enhance its functioning.

  [Excerpts] Bujumbura, 2 Feb (AFP)--Burundi's 
Tutsi-dominated Army fired in the air Wednesday to disperse 
demonstrators from the same ethnic group contesting the 
country's leadership in protests that have left at least 40 
dead. The soldiers moved for the first time against the 
protesters who had put up roadblocks in the northern Ngagara 
district of the capital for the third day running, an AFP 
correspondent said. Army chief of staff Lieutenant-Colonel Jean 
Bikomagu earlier said soldiers had "used the means of 
discussion" to make people go back to their homes, but warned 
that "if they refuse and the situation worsens, we have other 
means." [passage omitted] 
  Opposition leaders on Tuesday refused to meet Prime Minister 
Sylvie Kinigi, a Tutsi, to try to settle the dispute. On 
Wednesday, one party leader, Joseph Nzeyimana of the Rally for 
Democracy and Economic and Social Development, said on the radio 
that "the opposition refuses to talk to a government which has 
made itself both prosecutor and jury in this affair." [passage 
omitted] 
  In the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, a gathering of foreign 
ministers in the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) on 
Wednesday denounced what they called "negative actions" aimed at 
"torpedoing efforts to bring peace" to Burundi. In a statement, 
the OAU ministers expressed their "full support for the OAU in 
its backing for the legitimate government in Burundi." 
  The pan-African body has agreed to deploy a 
confidence-building and protection mission of 200 men, including 
180 soldiers, in the country, but the opposition has vowed to 
oppose this move. 
  Kinigi's government asked for international help after it 
was 
forced into hiding in foreign missions for several weeks during 
the strife that followed the murder of Ndadaye, the first 
elected Hutu president, and some of his aides.

<F P=106> [By Damien Ntiranyuhura] </F>
  [Excerpts] Bujumbura, Feb 2 (AFP) -- Burundi opposition 
parties suspended a strike Wednesday [2 February] after three 
days of ethnic and political clashes between Tutsis and Hutus 
which have left 46 dead, according to the paramilitary police. 
  The Collective of Opposition Parties announced that it was 
temporarily halting a protest over Burundi's leadership "to 
enable salaried employees and households to collect their pay 
and stock up" on Thursday and Friday. 
  Earlier Wednesday, soldiers of the Tutsi-dominated army 
fired 
in the air to disperse Tutsi demonstrators who had put up 
roadblocks in the northern Ngagara district of the capital. 
  Bujumbura paramilitary police, Major Lambert Sibomana, on 
Wednesday said in a broadcast that 46 people had been killed, 73 
youths arrested and 12 houses burned down in the strife between 
Tutsis and the Hutu majority. 
  The justice ministry on Saturday sacked five Tutsis among 
the 
seven judges in the constitutional court, who had been due to 
rule on the election of a new head of state, Hutu Agriculture 
Minister Cyprien Ntaryamira, by parliament. 
  Ntaryamira was elected on January 13 in place of the late 
Hutu president Melchoir Ndadaye, assassinated on October 21 in a 
military coup bid which led to the deaths of tens of thousands 
of people as ethnic strife swept the highland nation in central 
Africa. 
  The ruling Burundi Democracy Front (FRODEBU) and the main 
opposition Union for National Progress (UPRONA), backed 
Ntaryamira, but other, extra-parliamentary, opposition groups 
dismissed the move as a "civilian coup." 
  In a statement Wednesday, the Collective said it "thanks 
citizens of the capital who have positively supported this 
initiative to defend peace, legality and the independence of the 
judiciary" by shutting shops and closing the city down. 
  Opposition leaders have refused to meet Prime Minister 
Sylvie 
Kinigi, a Tutsi, to try to settle the dispute. 
  On Wednesday, one party leader, Joseph Nzeyimana of the 
Rally 
for Democracy and Economic and Social Development, said on the 
radio that "the opposition refuses to talk to a government which 
has made itself both prosecutor and jury in this affair." 
  The trouble began after justice officials on Saturday sacked 
five Tutsis among the seven members of the constitutional court, 
which had been due to rule on the election of Ntaryamira.

  [Text] In Burundi, Bujumbura airport has just been closed 
to civilian air traffic. The airport has also been occupied by 
heavily armed soldiers. We have just received this news from an 
AFP photographer who was on the scene. 
  Tension has remained high in the Burundi capital since 
clashes broke out on Monday [31 January]. There is said to be 
relative calm at the moment. The violence of the last two days 
has claimed 46 lives, according to the latest toll from the 
Burundi police. 
  This morning opposition parties met with the army high 
command to ask the army to mediate in their talks with the 
government on the appointment of a successor to assassinated 
president Melchior Ndadaye. 
  Still on the subject of Burundi, the Organization of African 
Unity is still unsure about sending troops to Burundi. An 
advance group of 200 soldiers drawn from several African 
countries was due to arrive in Burundi to protect the ministers 
of the Kinigi government, but the operation has now been delayed 
by the latest outbreak of violence.

  [Excerpts] The guest of "Afrique Soir" is the Burundian 
defense minister. The opposition parties in Burundi have 
decided to suspend for two days their efforts to turn Bujumbura 
into a ghost town. This started on Monday [31 January]. [passage 
omitted] The Army is being accused of passive complicity. This 
is denied by Defense Minister Charles Ntakije. He spoke to 
Dominique de Courcelles: 
  [Begin recording] [Ntakije] On Monday and Tuesday, we tried 
to talk, to raise the demonstrators' awareness, but today we 
have started making arrests. The situation is controlled by the 
Army. The situation is returning to normal. People can, I 
think, return to work this very afternoon or tomorrow. 
  [Courcelles] Has calm returned to the streets of Bujumbura 
then? 
  [Ntakije] Yes, calm has returned. People are going about 
their normal business in the street. 
  [Courcelles] How is it that the small parties belonging to 
the Collective were able to find such sympathy, manage to 
paralyze Bujumbura, and stir up trouble that left several dozen 
dead, even though they are not present in the parliament and the 
Army, UPRONA [Party of National Unity and Progress], FRODEBU 
[Front for Democracy in Burundi], and everyone has agreed to 
maintain legality. How is it that they have so much power? 
  [Ntakije] Because, as far as political circles are concerned 
in Bujumbura, there is a lot more extremism being expressed than 
there is moderation and political good sense. This means that 
the extremists have had much more effect on young people, who 
are open hearted and who go into the streets if asked. So they 
didn't use older people, who might think and refuse. They used 
young people, and now it is young people that we are having to 
deal with in the streets. We haven't seen any adults manning 
these barricades. I think that this is where they have been 
much more successful in raising people's awareness and blocking 
the streets. 
  [Courcelles] Can you say that the Army is resolutely behind 
the new president? 
  [Ntakije] Completely behind the president. Our problem is 
that politicians [words indistinct] cause problems where there 
aren't any, because they [words indistinct] the procedure 
instead of installing him immediately. They agree on the 
person, but don't want to install him. The Army is keen to see 
him installed as soon as possible because he is regarded as a 
factor of security. 
  [Courcelles] The chief of staff has said that the Army would 
not hesitate to resort to violence to restore calm. What does 
that mean? 
  [Ntakije] It means that since people's awareness was raised 
on Monday or Tuesday, we found that the consciousness raising 
that we were doing was not finding a response. The others who 
were stirring up the young people managed to get other messages 
across and that meant that, as far as the methodology of 
consciousness raising is concerned, we couldn't get through. So 
we had to resort to violent methods--arrests, for example, and 
using tear gas. 
  [Courcelles] What kind of arrests have you made? You are 
speaking of arrests? Who? 
  [Ntakije] First of all, we arrested the young people visible 
in the streets, blocking the streets, and setting up barricades 
in order to deter them from continuing this. And at the same 
time, we are explaining to these young people that it is not in 
their interest to block the roads because that means that 
economic activity comes to a halt and there is a risk of 
supplies drying up. Parallel to the arrests of these young 
people, we raise their awareness so that they won't start doing 
the same thing again. After that, we shall start on fines. [end

  [Text] Yaounde, 1 Feb (AFP)--Cameroonian magistrates and 
court clerks, who have been on strike since 2 January to back 
their salary demands, resumed work on 1 February, the national 
radio announced in Yaounde. Magistrates, who were present at 
courts throughout the entire country, displayed the February 
program for court hearings, the radio stated. All cases slated 
for trial in January will be dealt with in February, in 
accordance with the recommendations of the national follow-up 
committee on magistrates' demands, which has asked the judicial 
corps to work "without interruption." 
  In a statement on national radio, the committee chairman, 
Ferdinand Tchianga, announced the creation of "a solidarity 
fund" by the judicial staff to support their colleagues whose 
salaries have been suspended. The salaries of 56 magistrates 
and more than 200 court workers have been suspended for 
irregular attendance at work. 
  In addition, a "free association of moderate teachers," 
created in Douala, has decided to dissociate itself from the 
strike called on 24 January by the autonomous public high school 
teachers union, also in demand for salary payment. According to 
the national radio, this association appealed on 29 January "to 
teachers who have a sense of responsibility and who care for the 
future of their children" to resume classes.

  [Text] The cease-fire between government forces and 
opposition militias in the suburbs of Congo's capital, 
Brazzaville, came to a bloody end yesterday. The cease-fire was 
agreed only on Sunday [30 January] to end months of clashes 
following the disputed elections last year. But the government 
apparently tried to take advantage and clear the railway line to 
the coast. The opposition objected and launched an attack on a 
train. There were deaths and a lot of injuries. From 
Brazzaville, Antoine Mouyambala telexed this report. [read by 
announcer] 
  Two people were killed yesterday and another 30 injured when 
an opposition group attacked a train, carrying a team of workmen 
sent to reopen the railway line from Brazzaville to the coast. 
Traffic on the line had been disrupted for the past two months 
by opposition supporters, and the attack took place whilst the 
train was standing in a small station at Goma Tsetse in the 
opposition stronghold region of Pool, 50 km from Brazzaville. 
One of the dead was a senior official from the state railway 
company, and many of the wounded were soldiers who had been 
escorting the train. The victims were taken to Brazzaville 
yesterday afternoon, where an emergency meeting is expected to 
take place today between government and opposition supporters to 
discuss ways to bring the rising tide of violence in the country 
to an end. Despite yesterday's train attack, a spokesman for 
the pro-government presidential movement said that there would 
be no reversal of their cease-fire declaration made on Sunday.

  [Text] Brazzaville, 2 Feb (AFP) -- Congo's political 
leaders Wednesday postponed plans to restore a key supply line 
to the capital after three workers were killed in a machine gun 
attack as they tried to reopen the Brazzaville-Pointe Noire rail 
link. The third worker died from his wounds in hospital 
Wednesday following the attack by opposition rebels Tuesday. 
  Reopening the railway was to have been one of the first 
achievements of a fragile peace in conflict torn Congo following 
a sudden ceasefire agreement reached Sunday between the party of 
President Pascal Lissouba and the main opposition of Bernard 
Kolelas. 
  The two parties agreed Wednesday to put back the reopening 
of 
the railway until February 8. The 400-kilometer (240-mile) line 
between the capital and its main port and economic centre has 
been cut for over 40 days by barricades and removed rails. 
During that time, food has become scarce in the capital and 
prices have soared. The delay should give time for the parties 
to tell their supporters of the ceasefire, the parties added. 
  The attack on the carriage carrying state railway workers 
was 
a result of "a lack of awareness" of the ceasefire and "lack of 
coordination" between the parties, said Michel Malonga, a member 
of Lissouba's party.

  [Text] The United Nations and the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] may be optimistic about the 
outcome of the Lusaka peace talks, but the same cannot be said 
concerning the Luanda regime. Now that Eduardo dos Santos has 
lost every hope of turning UNITA into a pliable tool that he 
could easily manipulate, he has pulled the militarism trump out 
of his sleeve. The latest statements by [Angolan Armed Forces 
Chief of General Staff] Joao de Matos bear proof of that. 
  Under orders from Eduardo dos Santos, Joao de Matos 
yesterday 
told the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor 
Party [MPLA-PT] media that, quote, the Lusaka peace talks were a 
mere propaganda exercise, unquote. That is a very serious and 
irresponsible statement by Gen. Joao de Matos, and it reflects 
the [word indistinct] that has become so much part of the 
Futungo de Belas radical wing, which only cares for profits 
from its deals with foreign multinational companies, thereby 
forgetting completely about the Angolan people's suffering and 
famine. The Angolan people, who are closely following 
developments in Lusaka, are apprehensive and have repudiated the 
People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola, FAPLA, chief 
of General Staff's thoughtless remarks yesterday. Joao de 
Matos yesterday called on the Angolan people, who are fed up 
with the war, to arm and prepare for even more difficult times 
ahead. 
  Those remarks, which were seen in Angola as an insult to the 
fatherland, were made by the FAPLA chief shortly before he left 
Luanda for Brazil, where he will try to establish new military 
contacts. 
  According to a military source contacted by the Voice of the 
Resistance of the Black Cockerel yesterday, Brazil is today, 
along with the Russia, Cuba, and the DPRK, one of the main 
forces working for a holocaust in Angola. That military source 
also noted that Brazil is looking for a place where the war 
materiel it produces can be tested and sold, thereby turning 
into guinea pigs the people who live there. Brazil sees the 
MPLA-PT as fertile ground for testing its armament industry. 
  Our source also said that in past the MPLA-PT had received 
support from Russia, Cuba, Poland, the former Yugoslavia and 
GDR, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia. Adding that such cooperation 
from opportunists and adventure seekers will not threaten the 
Angolan people's desire to achieve freedom, that source noted 
that, quote, the Angolan people will defend themselves until 
justice has been done in this country, unquote.

<F P=106> [Interview with UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin </F>
Beye in Lusaka by reporter Ndai Auhami in London on the "Network 
Africa" program on 1 February] 
  [Text] After 18 years of war, is Angola at last on the 
brink of peace, or is this yet another false dawn? Well, very 
positive signs are now emerging from the talks that have been 
going on in the Zambian capital, Lusaka, since November. It 
seems, the representatives of the MPLA [Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola] government and the rebel movement, UNITA 
[National Union for the Total Independence of Angola], have 
reached agreement on many of the crucial points. The first sign 
of this emerged on Monday when it was announced that they had 
agreed on the future composition of the police force. Well, 
mediating at those talks has been the UN's envoy to Angola, 
Alioune Blondin Beye. Up to now, he has been reluctant to 
discuss the progress of the talks with the media, but last night 
he was only too happy to tell us what has been happening. Ndai 
Auhami has called him up in Lusaka and asked him first if the 
progress was so substantial that the war in Angola was now over. 
  [Begin recording] [Beye, in French fading into English 
translation] No, one cannot say that because, although we have, 
well, sorted out the reinstatement of the cease-fire, we have 
not yet proclaimed it. It will not come into place yet because 
we have chosen a global accord, and it is only when the global 
accord is finished that we will be able to say that the war in 
Angola is finished. 
  [Auhami] Mr. Blondin Beye, what about the withdrawal from 
areas occupied since the elections, and the acceptance of the 
election results? 
  [Beye] This question has been definitely solved. A letter 
signed by UNITA addressed to the UN secretary general formally 
accepts to withdraw from occupied zones after the elections, and 
this withdrawal has been programmed, and is already solved 
militarily, and will be under UN supervision when the time 
comes. Its principles and modalities have already been 
negotiated. 
  [Auhami] Does UNITA accept the results of the election? 
  [Beye] UNITA has formally declared at the beginning of the 
Lusaka talks, and already during the exploratory talks of 
Lusaka-I that it formally accepted the September's 92 election 
results and their consequences. 
  [Auhami] It is a very big breakthrough in Lusaka, so what is 
going to happen now? 
  [Beye] Yes, since Monday [31 January] when the police 
question was resolved, we can say that we are at a turning 
point, as a sportsman climbing a mountain, who has made a great 
effort to reach the top. With the police question we have 
reached the top of the mountain, and we are now starting the 
downward slope. Indeed, very substantial and significant 
progress has been made, and with the solution to the police 
question, it is a significant move forward. What is left now is 
to be patient still to negotiate in the same conditions, and to 
count on the same political will of the government and UNITA, 
and count on the press' understanding that they should let us 
work in private which has worked so well for us. 
  [Auhami] So, in your mind, is the killing in Angola over, 
the 
bloodshed over? 
  [Beye] Yes, I am one of those who sincerely regrets that 
UNITA and the government are still having fatal combats. It is 
high time now that the political will is paramount, and now that 
the choice has been made to solve the Angola crisis not by 
military means, but by negotiations, the time has come to put an 
end to the Angola tragedy, that Angolans stop killing each other 
unnecessarily as peace is near at hand. So, if the negotiations 
are solved, as I hope they will be, I hope the Angola tragedy 
will end. We took time, but we didn't waste our time. We 
preferred to negotiate seriously and in depth to leave nothing 
out, to leave no problem aside, and attack each question 
resolutely and in detail in order that this time the peace be a 
durable and real one, and that Angola finally know peace. 
  [Auhami] How long do you think you are going to stay in 
Lusaka? Are you going to stay for more than two weeks, three 
weeks, a month? 
  [Beye] I must be very modest. It would be very pretentious 
of me to be able to predict on such a difficult question as 
Angola. Five centuries of colonization, 15 years of freedom 
fighting, 17 years of fratricide fighting do not get resolved in 
a few months or weeks. We must have time to solve this 
question. What the international community does not accept is 
the [words indistinct] to stay put. Other than that we are 
ready to invest the time necessary as long as each day marks 
progress, that each day means a step toward peace. We will not 
accept staying put, but if everyday we can make progress, we are 
ready to go slowly. [end recording]

  [Text] Observers in the Angolan peace process have issued a 
declaration saying they believe the time has come to consider 
adopting measures that would translate the true progress 
achieved in the Zambian capital. The declaration was issued by 
the Portuguese Foreign Ministry: 
  The Angolan Government and the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] have agreed on principles which 
will govern UNITA's participation in the Angolan national 
police. This agreement constitutes an important success for 
peace in Angola. 
  Although the government and UNITA had genuine concerns on 
this issue at the beginning, both sides continued with their 
efforts in good faith to find mutually acceptable solutions, 
thus demonstrating their political desire to bring peace to 
Angola. 
  A lot has already been achieved in Lusaka. The government 
and UNITA have reached agreements on various difficult and 
complex issues, including the restablishment of a verifiable 
cease-fire, the confinement and disarmament of UNITA military 
forces, the conclusion of the training of the Angolan Armed 
Forces, and the integration of demobilized troops into civilain 
society. 
  The present agreement on police issues means that both sides 
have overcome another important landmark toward a just and 
lasting peace. The government and UNITA have now begun to debate 
national reconciliation and it is our belief that they will be 
able to carry out this task with the same political courage and 
the same spirit and consensus needed to reach an agreement. 
  The peace process, which began in Bicesse and which 
people--particularly the Angolan people--have awaited for so 
long, has now started to become a reality. Thus, we call on all 
parties to exercise maximun restraint, taking into account what 
has already been achieved in Lusaka and to halt all military 
activities because they can undermine the hopes of the Angolan 
people and the international community concerning the 
establishment of peace in Angola. There is no military solution 
for the Angolan problem. We believe the time has come to 
consider measures which will translate the true progress 
achieved in Lusaka into a lasting peace in Angola. 
  Although the principal responsibility for peace rests with 
UNITA and the government, the international community has an 
important role to play in supporting the maintenance of peace 
and in responding to the many humanitarian needs facing Angola. 
It is our hope and conviction that working jointly, we shall 
finally be able to bring the reward of peace to the Angolan 
people.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Jorge Valentim, UNITA information </F>
secretary, by BBC reporter Carlos Alberto Araujo on the "London 
Last Minute" program on 1 February--place not given] 
  [Text] National reconciliation is now the big issue being 
discussed by the Angolan Government and the National Union for 
the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] at the Lusaka peace 
talks. Yesterday, the two sides took an important step forward 
when they reached an agreement on the formation of the future 
national police force. That accord provides for UNITA's 
participation in that force with 5,500 police agents, out of a 
total of 25,700 men. The agreement saw that delicate hurdle 
overcome and, also yesterday the two teams moved to discuss 
national reconciliation, the second point on the agenda of the 
proceedings and one of the fundamental issues concerns the 
distribution of ministerial portfolios. BBC reporter Carlos 
Alberto Araujo interviewed UNITA Information Secretary Jorge 
Alicerces Valentim this afternoon. Araujo began by asking what 
UNITA's demands concerning this issue were. 
  [Begin Valentim recording] I can tell you that we will be 
presenting political points rather than demands. For instance, 
taking into account the great national catastrophe that has 
morally and otherwise ravaged the country, we are for a single 
entity, but a single entity with an acceptable standing. In 
view of that, we believe that decentralization will be an exit 
door, a door that will lead to our salvation and will allow the 
Angolan entity to remain united. In this case, unlike what 
happened in 1992, we want UNITA to have a more significant 
participation in government. I believe these are reasonable 
points of view. Another point that is very dear to us is the 
status to be enjoyed and the protection guarantees for our 
President Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi. In addition, UNITA 
militants must be allowed economic participation in the national 
economy. We would have liked to have a wider national vision of 
the problem at this stage, we would like it made clear that it 
is not only the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola's 
[MPLA] militants who participate in the economic life of this 
nation and enjoy the country's great benefits. The sympathizers 
and militants of UNITA and parties must also be able to do so. 
[end recording] 
  UNITA Information Secretary Jorge Valentim admitted that 
UNITA now wants to secure more important ministerial portfolios 
than the ones it was given in 1992 and he alleges that only such 
a move can guarantee the Angolan people that UNITA will 
substantively participate in the national life of Angola. 
  [Begin recording] [Valentim] Yes, I mean, it is so that 
people believe in the truth, that we are moving toward national 
reconciliation and it is important that the ministerial 
portfolios be important, that they make the people believe that 
UNITA is responsible for really important public matters. Now, 
if we are given something like the Culture Ministry, a few 
secretariats, and so forth, that will amount to no more than an 
experiment. However, I think that even the government is 
rethinking its stand. If the government does indeed rethink its 
stand, then that will be a positive point. The year of 1994 
will not be equal to 1992. We all evolve and we will reach an 
understanding, just as we did concerning the army and the police. 
  [Araujo] Mr. Jorge Valentim: would you confirm that UNITA 
will be asking for the Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Interior 
Ministries? 
  [Valentim] Well, I would only like to say that we will be 
asking for ministries that we deem important. However, because 
we are at the first stage of discussions, we would only like to 
discuss the general aspects, but as the talks progress, perhaps 
within the next week, we will give more details about what 
ministries we really want. 
  [Araujo] Mr. Jorge Valentim: you said at the start of this 
interview that it is important to build a climate of trust 
between the two sides. Do you not think that it is 
contradictory that the two sides should have reached an 
agreement on the national police issue at a time when there are 
reports of intensified fighting in various parts of Angola? 
  [Valentim] Well, even though we are here, we are concerned 
about the intensification of the clashes. We can even say that 
both the mediation and the observers have condemned and are not 
in agreement with this escalation in the fighting. We have 
presented requests to the mediation and the observers for the 
fighting to stop. We made such a request only yesterday and the 
day before. We should not be discussing national reconciliation 
in a climate of war. [end recording] 
  UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali will today present 
to the Security Council his report on the progress of the peace 
talks in Lusaka. Diplomatic sources in New York believe the 
report will be positive. The agreement on national police 
happens a day after that report is presented, and this seems to 
suggest that UNITA may have been pressured. However, Jorge 
Valentim says that this was a mere coincidence. 
  [Begin Valentim recording] No, this is a mere coincidence 
and 
has nothing to do with the UN timetable. It happened that, 
after 37 days, we finalized the talks. In reality we have 
reached an agreement. Why should we have discussed the police 
issue in a hurry, without bases? Let me say that it is not an 
MPLA or UNITA police that will emerge, it is a state police in 
the service of the nation, a police force which will look at the 
security of each citizen, regardless of his political 
affiliation, race or ethnic origin. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Jorge Valentim, UNITA spokesman, by Walter </F>
Medeiros in Lusaka on 2 February] 
  [Text] Angola faces the challenge of the peace talks. 
Interviewed earlier today by Walter Medeiros, Jorge Valentim 
guaranteed that UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence 
of Angola] does not want the talks to break down and replied to 
Luanda's charges by saying that the party of the black cockerel 
wants neither Balkanization nor federalism for Angola. 
  [Begin recording] [Valentim] I have a degree in political 
science from Brussels University, and I know what Balkanization 
means. This is not the Europe of 1914, with all those fledgling 
republics. No one wants to set up republics in the interior of 
Angola. What fighting there is is the consequence of the 
massacre of October/November 1992. What we want to achieve 
here, what we, the UNITA delegates [to the Lusaka talks], are 
openly advocating here in the negotiations with the government 
delegation--and there is noticeable political goodwill between 
the two sides at delegation level--we can say that we advocate a 
unitarian, but decentralized state. And political and 
administrative decentralization is not incompatible with, nor 
antithetical to, the concept of a unitarian state. This is 
scientific, textbook stuff, and its application is universal. 
  [Medeiros] The agenda item that will be discussed in the 
next 
few days is national reconciliation in Angola. As is known, 
this will entail power-sharing at government level. What 
ministries would UNITA like to have in a national unity 
government? 
  [Valentim] Regarding the question of UNITA's participation 
in 
the government, I would rather it was not defined in the general 
terms of power sharing versus no power sharing. UNITA wants to 
participate very substantially at all levels of the central 
administration. Now it is up to the two sides to find a modus 
vivendi for this participation. But to start calling it power 
sharing could cause a bit of a headache, because power sharing 
is defined in a certain way in the teaching of political 
sciences, but the public define it differently. So we would 
rather see our aims interpreted in a more legitimate way: We are 
ready to participate in the central government in a significant 
manner, not along the lines of the [government] theses of 1992. 
  [Medeiros] When you speak of a significant manner, what do 
you mean in concrete terms? 
  [Valentim] I mean participating by taking on public and 
important responsibilities such as may inculcate feelings of 
security and confidence that the process of national 
reconciliation has indeed begun and that a bright future lies 
before all Angolans alike. 
  [Medeiros] Does that mean UNITA wants the Defense or 
Interior 
Ministries? Does it mean the Economy, Finance, or Petroleum 
Ministries? Does it mean the Ministry of Foreign Affairs? 
  [Valentim] All I would like to say is that the government 
knows us well, and we know the government. The party in power, 
the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola], has 
its history. We have ours, too. And we know each other's 
histories. 
  [Medeiros] What if the government offers UNITA the 
Ministries 
of Education, Health, Social Rehabilitation, and Culture? Will 
UNITA accept these portfolios? 
  [Valentim] We are....[pauses] We are not in the realm of 
hypothesis. That is not what the government is saying. We 
would rather wait. We are in direct communication with the 
government. Today we had a very fruitful meeting of over two 
hours, but we did not talk in those terms. We discussed 
political and administrative decentralization. We discussed 
security for all Angolans, the leaders and the led alike. We 
talked about UNITA's participation in the central government. 
We talked about the status of the president of UNITA. We 
talked about reciprocal pardons or amnesties. We talked about 
lots of things. 
  [Medeiros] What status is UNITA claiming for Dr. Savimbi? 
  [Valentim] Well, we have already defined it. It is the 
status he merits as a historic figure and leader of the largest 
opposition party. There are certain prerogatives and privileges 
that we wish accorded to him so that he may in fact fully 
exercise his role in society for the good of national 
reconciliation. 
  [Medeiros] Does that include his personal security? And what 
post would he have? 
  [Valentim] No, no, no. We are still only at the stage of 
security matters. The question of his post will be a basis for 
negotiation with the government and we believe that, for the 
moment, [if we settle for] the status of UNITA president, with 
full security and respect for his person, I believe we shall 
have taken a good step forward. 
  [Medeiros] So an announcement that the talks have broken 
down 
is out of the question. 
  [Valentim] Well, there has never been a question here of 
announcing that the talks have broken down. 
  [Medeiros] I do not mean over there [in Lusaka], I mean in 
Huambo. 
  [Valentim] In Huambo, UNITA criticized a bellicose trend 
emerging on the government's side. That was UNITA's position. 
UNITA did not say it wanted a breakdown. All it did was note 
the discrepancy between the negotiating steps being taken here 
and the recrudescence of the fighting in the interior. [end 
recording] 
  UNITA pledges that Angola is one and indivisible. Jorge 
Valentim was being interviewed by Walter Medeiros.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Huambo correspondent Lourenco Bento] </F>
  [Text] At the beginning of January the National Union for 
the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] and Luanda government 
teams resumed their marathon talks on political issues with a 
view to achieving a general accord that will put an end to the 
Angolan conflict. 
  In light of the progress made by the two teams concerning 
military issues, notably a cease-fire agreement and the 
formation of the future armed forces, the Luanda government 
should have announced a unilateral cease-fire as a show of good 
faith. Given that UNITA had already announced its unilateral 
cease-fire, such a measure would have allowed a general 
cease-fire to have been in place throughout Angolan territory, 
and the Lusaka peace talks could have continued without cannons 
firing away on the battlefield. That did not happen, though. 
  The Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor 
Party 
[MPLA-PT] has a negotiating team in Lusaka, but inside the 
country the Futungo de Belas Palace leadership is determined to 
continue its military offensive against UNITA-controlled areas. 
It has been receiving massive military aid from Russia, Brazil, 
and Spain. It has also been joined by mercenaries of various 
nationalities, thereby showing complete disrespect for the peace 
efforts being made by UNITA -- which sent a team to Lusaka to 
negotiate peace -- by the UN special representative in Angola, 
and that portion of the international community that means well, 
all of which are interested in a peaceful settlement to the 
conflict that has been devastating the country. 
  The events that have been marking the daily lives of 
Angolans 
clearly show that, far from wanting peace for Angola, the Luanda 
government is rather more interested in a military solution. 
That position has been made all the clearer in recent 
statements by unelected Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos 
Santos, the top Futungo de Belas chieftain, and Joao de Matos, 
People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola chief of 
General Staff, when he addressed a ceremony where new officers 
received their stripes. Joao de Matos noted on that occasion 
that those officers would now lead their military units on the 
combat fronts. 
  Taking into account the fact that the Angolan people 
anxiously want peace and that the Angolan economy is in chaos -- 
and showing every tendency to deteriorate even further -- it 
would have been expected that the sole combat front should have 
been Lusaka. All honest people wanting peace in Angola have 
turned their attention to the Lusaka peace talks. Eduardo dos 
Santos and his warmongering sidekicks are insisting on shellings 
and air bombardments, but such acts can only worsen the people's 
already very depressing social and economic conditions. 
  Jose Eduardo dos Santos continues to show quite clearly that 
he is only concerned with staying in power. He did not obtain 
the necessary 51 percent of the vote, so he usurped power by 
carrying out tribal massacres at the end of October and in the 
first days of November 1992. Those events led to war, causing 
confusion that has been used by the Futungo de Belas Palace 
leadership to enrich themselves. Despite all that, the Angolan 
people remain hopeful about the Lusaka peace talks which, they 
hope, will provide the correct solutions to the grave problems 
facing Angolan society. 
  Through its concessions, UNITA has been making negotiation 
possible in the Zambian capital. Despite many provocations by 
the MPLA-PT forces, the Armed Forces for the Liberation of 
Angola, FALA, have continued to observe the unilateral 
cease-fire declared by UNITA. UNITA has recognized the Bicesse 
Accord and the results of the fraudulent September 1992 
elections. Furthermore, UNITA has also accepted the UN 
resolutions on Angola. Such courageous steps reflect UNITA 
leadership's good will and have ensured progress at the Lusaka 
peace talks. 
  The MPLA-PT government had been reluctant and had continued 
to stick to its obsolete theories, which reflect its desire to 
keep Angola and all its people under its totalitarian and 
monolithic regime, but it has been forced to give in. Now, 
there is talk that an accord has been reached concerning the 
future national police force issue. For a long time, the 
Angolan people did not have a police force that defended their 
interests, so now they are happy about this important step 
forward at the talks. 
  For the better part of a month, the UNITA negotiating team 
defended the creation of a new national police force that will 
serve the Angolan people, contrary to what has happened so far, 
where the so-called police force is an army pursuing social 
instability in the country. 
  The Angolan people were happy to learn that UNITA will 
substantively participate in the future national police force. 
No one will be detained without having undergone trial. The 
Futungo de Belas leaders got us used to having the police rob, 
detain, and kill people without trial. Such a confused 
situation's days are numbered. A national police force with a 
substantial UNITA presence will be a source of pride to the 
Angolan people, and it will serve all citizens. There will be 
respect for the law and for public order. 
  Now that discussions on the national police dossier have 
been 
wound up, other fundamental political issues are to be viewed, 
notably the political and administrative [words indistinct] the 
status of opposition political parties, freedom of the press, a 
government of national unity that fosters national 
reconciliation, the status of UNITA President Dr. Jonas Malheiro 
Savimbi, and a redefinition of acting President of the Republic 
Jose Eduardo dos Santos' powers. Those are, among others, the 
issues that the negotiators must contend with from now on. 
  May good sense prevail! May Angolans be able to understand 
each other for the sake of higher interests! Let us all unite 
behind the same ideals! There will be peace, national 
reconciliation, and peaceful coexistence because the Angolan 
people desire them. 
  Lusaka is the beacon of hope.

<F P=106> [Report on news conference by Mozambican President Joaquim </F>
Alberto Chissano at Luanda's 4 February Airport on 2 
February--passages within quotation marks recorded] 
  [Text] Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano returned to 
his country this morning after a 24-hour visit to our country. 
Angolan Prime Minister Marcolino Moco and other government 
officials went to Luanda's international 4 February Airport to 
bid farewell to the Mozambican head of state, who was 
accompanied by Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. 
President Joaquim Chissano, who had arrived in Luanda on 1 
February after visits to Switzerland and Portugal, held talks 
with a team led by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and met 
with the Angolan Government's economic team led by Prime 
Minister Marcolino Moco. Before leaving Luanda, the Mozambican 
head of state held a news conference at the airport and said he 
was a witness to the great openness shown by President Jose 
Eduardo dos Santos and the Angolan Government with a view to 
achieving peace and solidifying democracy. 
  [Chissano] "We have been very [words indistinct] the stance 
adopted by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos concerning the 
search for solutions to the extremely complex Angolan issue. We 
were very surprised by the degree of openness shown by the 
Angolan Government and President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, 
particularly if you take into account the destruction that has 
ravaged Angola, the killing of people, and the current state of 
the economy because of the war. It is enough to say that many 
Angolan cities have lost all their industrial assets and that 
the areas that are perhaps most central to this country's 
development have been occupied, destroyed, and their production 
has been completely blocked. Any attempt to try and reverse 
this situation will indeed require much courage. We have seen 
that courage in the Angolan Government. It is full of 
initiative and imagination, to the extent that we feel our 
problems are minor by comparison and we feel quite encouraged to 
look for solutions to our problems." 
  President Joaquim Chissano described as groundless rumors 
going around that Mozambique's multiparty elections might be 
postponed. 
  [Chissano] "More often than not such rumors are created by 
people who make their own assessments and predictions. They 
speculate. However, neither the Mozambican Government nor our 
country's political parties have put forward any such 
suggestions yet. We believe everything is going well and we 
believe it will be possible to hold elections by October of this 
year, as scheduled. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] "However, President Chissano, 
the government appears to have had some problems concerning the 
troop confinement process. 
  [Chissano] "Those who want to exaggerate problems and make 
the whole process unworkable will probably say so. What I know 
is that there are times when the implementation of the accord 
goes faster and there are others when it goes slower. One 
cannot adjudge the whole process because of what happened over 
one or two days. The troop confinement process can and will be 
implemented in good time. The delay you were talking about has 
to do with the government forces. I know that we can confine 
all troops before the scheduled deadline and that is what we are 
going to do." 
  The Mozambican head of state said that the Mozambique 
Liberation Front [Frelimo] Party's victory in the October 
elections is already a certainty. 
  [Chissano] "There is no argument that Frelimo will win. What 
appears to be a greater source of debate at this stage is how 
the other parties will fare in the elections, how may seats they 
will get in the Assembly and whether they come second, third, 
fourth, and so on. Frelimo's victory seems to me to be a 
certainty, even to the opposition. Nonetheless, I must tell you 
that my party's belief is that we must work hard. If we fail to 
do so, things could change over the next few months and, as you 
know, several factors play a hand in elections but, were 
elections to be held today, tomorrow, or a month from now, 
Frelimo's victory would be....[pauses] Well, we would be faced 
with a new problem: we would not know how to accommodate the 
other parties."

  [Text] The Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] has 
accused the government of violating the General Peace Accord by 
moving militiamen at Sangage, Nampula Province, an area that is 
under Renamo's control. Notification of this was made during a 
meeting of the Cease-Fire Commission this morning. 
  Asked to comment on the issue, the government's Major 
Eduardo 
Alexandre said it was a regular movement that will eventually 
culminate with the abolition of militia forces. Some time ago, 
the government troops that had occupied Sangage after the 
General Peace Accord were forced to withdraw by the Cease-Fire 
Commission. 
  Meanwhile, Renamo soldies are moving toward Salamanga 
Assembly Area in Maputo Province. This area has not yet been 
approved because of a dispute between the government and Renamo.

  [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs says reports 
reaching it in Accra indicate that despite the closure of the 
Ghana-Togo border by the Togolese authorities, several Ghanaian 
traders use bush paths to enter Togo. This they do after paying 
bribes to Togolese soldiers and other border officials. 
According to the reports, the men among the traders are 
arrested by the Togolese soldiers after they have entered Togo. 
A statement by the ministry said efforts by the Ghana Embassy 
in Togo to secure their release are being jeopardized by a 
steady stream of arrests. The ministry therefore advises all 
Ghanaians, particularly traders, not to put themselves at such 
unnecessary risks at this time when the Togolese side of the 
common border is closed.

  [Text] Conakry, 1 Feb (AFP) -- Guinean President Lansana 
Conte announced in Conakry today that he will soon form a new 
government that will be more "representative and composed of 
more competent Guineans." He made the statement during a news 
conference, the first since his investiture on 29 January as 
president of the Republic. The Guinean head of state further 
added that this government will not necessarily include members 
of political parties. 
  Questioned on the possible participation of the Guinean 
opposition in the next government, President Conte said: "I 
will not beg anyone. It is up to the opposition to come to me 
if they believe they have to contribute to the development of 
their country." "If we form a government including people from 
all political trends we run the risk of being taken hostage," he 
added. 
  At the end of the first pluralist election in Guinea on 19 
December, President Conte was elected for a five-year term with 
51.70 percent of the votes. His election was contested by the 
opposition candidates who boycotted the 29 January swearing in 
ceremony. 
  Concluding, General Conte called on African countries to 
"speed up" the economic integration process.

National Union of Teachers [SYNAPROF], to demand better working 
conditions and salary increases. 
  The minister of national education condemned this strike, 
adding that he did not rule out the use of force to call the 
teachers back to work. In October 1993, the SYNAPROF had sent a 
notice to the authorities for a strike slated for December.

  [Text] Monrovia, 3 Feb (AFP) -- The Liberian Interim 
Government called on Wednesday for an "urgent" meeting of West 
African countries to discuss the situation in Liberia and the 
peace process which is entering a critical stage. 
  In a statement issued in Monrovia, the government said a 
meeting of the Economic Community of West African States 
(ECOWAS) was "necessary to review the implementation of the most 
critical phase of the peace process - the commencement of 
disarmament and the seating of the transitional government". 
  The disarming process initially due to start in August was 
postponed and has still not begun despite the arrival of 364 UN 
military observers and 1,600 Tanzanian and Ugandan soldiers sent 
to reinforce the Nigerian-led ECOMOG [ECOWAS Cease-Fire 
Monitoring Group] peace force. Under an agreement signed on 
July 25 last year between the various Liberian factions, the 
ECOMOG force mandated by ECOWAS will be responsible for 
disarming the belligerents under UN supervision. Sierra Leone 
and Ghana have already called for an ECOWAS meeting to discuss 
Liberia. On Tuesday Sierra Leonean Foreign Minister Abass Bundu 
criticised the "slow pace of the disarmament process".

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] The international community appears to be gradually 
losing patience with the slow progress Liberia's factions are 
making toward disarmament and the establishment of a 
transitional government. Under the Cotonou Agreement, signed by 
the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia], ULIMO [United 
Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia], and the interim 
government, Liberia should be preparing for multiparty elections 
this month but the peace process has virtually ground to a halt 
despite the arrival of UN observers and the reinforcements for 
ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire 
Monitoring Group]. At the end of last week, UN special envoy 
Trevor Gordon-Somers carried a message from the Security Council 
in New York back to the faction leaders in Liberia and at the 
weekend he had a meeting with Charles Taylor in Gbarnga. He is 
now back in Monrovia and on the line. Josephine Hazely asked him 
what the message says. 
  [Begin recording] [Gordon-Somers] Well, the Security Council 
has issued a communique asking the leaders of the three parties 
to demonstrate tangible progress in the process and the Security 
Council identified that tangible process as the immediate 
commencement of disarmament and the immediate seating of the 
transitional government, and also, the council wants a schedule 
for the holding of free and fair elections. 
  [Hazely] How was that message received by Mr. Taylor? 
  [Gordon-Somers] Very well. He was in complete accord with 
the message. 
  [Hazely] But, what does that mean? I mean, does that take 
your negotiations anywhere nearer to the end of this old saga in 
Liberia? 
  [Gordon-Somers] Well, I should think so. If the three 
parties, and I might say that not only did Mr. Taylor find the 
message acceptable, but I also had met with Dr. Sawyer before 
and I had met with Chairman Alhaji Koromah before, and all of 
them accepted the thrust of the Security Council message. I 
think that is very positive. 
  [Hazely] Mr. Somers, as you very well know, they always 
accept these messages. They always accept these resolutions and 
accords, but they do not put them into practice, do they? 
  [Gordon-Somers] Well, let us say that there has been a 
history and there are present circumstances. I would like to 
believe that the parties themselves, having been reassured of 
the support of the international community, will be able to 
translate that into tangible action. 
  [Hazely] OK, let us talk about tangible action now. When do 
you see this transitional government sitting? 
  [Gordon-Somers] Remember that the sitting of the 
transitional 
government is clearly the prerogative of the three parties. The 
Security Council was not attempting to impose something on the 
parties, just to signal to them what the Security Council wants 
to see, so I have not yet consulted the three parties together, 
which I hope to do soon and see if we can reach an agreement on 
that. 
  [Hazely] As you would realize, what most Liberians want to 
know now is: For God's sake, when is the date going to be given 
when we have a transitional government, when we have this 
disarmament started? I mean, is it not.... [pauses] Is that not 
what we want to hear now? The date? 
  [Gordon-Somers] I share the frustration with all Liberians 
who want to hear the date. I, too, want to hear the date, and I 
think we are moving to that position. I wish I could be more 
forthcoming at this moment, but I cannot be, as you may well 
understand. This is a sensitive matter, and it is one in which 
the Liberian leadership, with all the counsel that they can get 
from Liberians on how soon and how quickly we can move forward.

  [Text] The head of state, General Sani Abacha, has said 
that in the face of recent geopolitical developments in the 
world, Africa has to look inwards to sustain its growth. He 
gave this advice at the opening of bilateral talks between 
Nigeria and Chad, which were held in Abuja today. State House 
correspondent Chris Mbu has that one. 
  [Begin Mbu recording] The bilateral talks began shortly 
after 
the Chadian President Idriss Deby flew into Abuja this morning. 
Gen. Abacha, opening the talks, said that regional and 
subregional cooperation among the African countries are 
important for safeguarding the independence of the continent. 
He described the Chadian leader's visit to Nigeria at this 
point in time as a testimony of the strong ties between Chad and 
Nigeria. President Idriss Deby, in his opening remarks, 
described the African economic (?issue) and cooperation in the 
form of subregional economic groupings as effective vehicles for 
growth and development for Africa. He said that integration is 
the only salvation for the continent. President Deby then 
briefed Gen. Abacha on Chad's democratization process and on the 
difficulties the recent devaluation of the West African CFA 
franc has (?caused for) Chad. The Chadian president and his 
delegation have since left for home. 
  Also today in [word indistinct] Villa, Abuja, Gen. Sani 
Abacha received a special message from President 'Umar Ahmad 
al-Bashir of Sudan, brought in by Sudanese Envoy Colonel Bakri 
Hasan Salih. The envoy, who is political adviser to the 
Sudanese president, told Gen. Abacha that Sudan deeply 
appreciates Nigeria's initiatives and contributions to the peace 
process in the Sudan. He said that the agreements reached at 
the Abuja talks on peace in the Sudan remain the basis for 
ongoing peace processes in the country. Gen. Abacha urged the 
Sudanese to consolidate the gains made during the Abuja peace 
talks. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Sierra Leone's ruling military council is accusing 
the Liberian rebel leader, Charles Taylor, of being responsible 
for the recent escalation of the rebel war in southeastern 
Sierra Leone. This morning the foreign minister, Dr. Abass 
Bundu, claimed that NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] 
forces are active on the side of Foday Sankoh's RUF 
[Revolutionary United Front] rebels, and he issued a warning 
that the war may be about to assume a new dimension. From 
Freetown, Victor Sylver telexed this report. 
  Briefing newsmen this morning in Freetown, Foreign Secretary 
Abass Bundu said that there was ample proof that Charles Taylor 
had moved large quantities of arms, ammunition, and men into 
Sierra Leone, not only to beef up Foday Sankoh's RUF rebels, 
said Dr. Bundu, but also to create an enclave within Sierra 
Leone for keeping arms and men of the NPFL that would not be 
disarmed when the process gets under way in Liberia under the 
terms of the Cotonou Accord. The foreign secretary said that 
the Cotonou Accords did not envisage that the ploys now being 
used by the NPFL would crop up, such as using neighboring 
countries to evade the disarmament procedure. He said that the 
accords were mainly concerned with events in Liberia and that 
recent developments of attempted attacks on Guinea and in Sierra 
Leone call for a closer look at the agreement. 
  Dr. Bundu revealed that the Sierra Leone Government intends 
to ask the ECOWAS [Economic Community of West African States] 
secretary general to convene a meeting of the nine countries 
that have been assigned the task of reviewing the implementation 
of the Cotonou Accords in Liberia with a view to highlighting 
the new development in the war in Sierra Leone. The foreign 
secretary told the press that evidence now revealed that Charles 
Taylor has been using a number of ploys to escape the process of 
disarmament, disguising his troops as police personnel or [words 
indistinct] of a number of different organizations. He said 
reports from areas recently attacked by the rebels talk of 
stories by local villagers that ULIMO [United Liberation 
Movement for Democracy in Liberia] forces were fighting 
alongside NPFL and RUF forces against government troops. This 
is just one ploy now being used by Charles Taylor, said Dr. 
Bundu, to create confusion inside Sierra Leone.

  [Text] Units from the Somali armed forces today peacefully 
demonstrated in the streets of Mogadishu. These armed forces 
started their march near the former port of Mogadishu and they 
were composed of various sections of the country's armed forces, 
with each unit led by an officer. They gathered at the UN 
office in Mogadishu. The Voice of the People radio reporters 
who are the source of this item add that the officers leading 
the armed forces have handed a statement of complaint to the UN 
office in Mogadishu. They made it clear that the armed forces of 
Somalia are ready to save the people from these difficult times, 
as has always been their tradition. 
  One officer called Colonel Shabib Shaykh Ali Muhiyadin Asr, 
told Ilm Osman Farah, alias Elmi Boderi, our reporter, that the 
Somali armed forces will once again rescue their people as they 
did in the 1963 drainage campaign, in the defense of 
independence in 1964 and in the rescue of the people during the 
famine of 1974. 
  The officer called on the political organizations in the 
country to unite and arrive at a consensus to facilitate the 
establishment of a Somali nation living according to Islamic 
shariah. 
  The demonstration, which ended peacefully, was zealously led 
by the musical band of the armed forces, who played the national 
anthem. Many people crowded the streets, shouting slogans 
including: "Somalia belongs to Somalis," "Victory to the Somali 
armed forces," "The Somali people should unite," and so on.

  [Excerpts] President Yoweri Museveni, who is on the third 
day of a working visit to Gulu District, has warned the 
candidates for the Constituent Assembly elections to desist from 
confusing the public with lies in a bid to get votes. 
  Addressing a public rally yesterday at (Kochgoma) health 
center, in Gulu District, President Museveni pointed out that 
one of the remaining major weaknesses among the people are 
politicians whose politics is lies. He reminded the people who 
gathered to listen to him that, in the past, Uganda had been 
reduced to a laughing stock by leaders whose main characteristic 
was lies. 
  Explaining that it is his duty as a leader to expose such 
lies for what they are, President Museveni enumerated the major 
lies being spread around by some of the aspiring candidates, and 
challenged those spreading them to come out in public and 
substantiate them. 
  He dismissed the lie that the National Resistance Movement 
[NRM] government had sold land to foreigners as nonsensical, and 
asked the propagators to explain to the public under what law 
the contract or arrangement for this has been done. In the same 
light, Museveni dismissed the allegation that the NRM government 
has sold the Murchison Falls National Park to foreigners, saying 
that the government has only given permission to various 
companies to build or rehabilitate hotels in the parks. 
  He also condemned politicians who go around discouraging the 
people from paying taxes and emphasized that the people of 
Uganda need to be aware that they must finance the biggest 
portion of the national budget. He, however, advised the 
district leaders to assess the tax of peasants realistically and 
correctly, according to their income. 
  Museveni also dismissed the talk being propagated that the 
NRM government is a government of Banyarwanda [tribe]. He said 
that the NRM government is a government of the people of Uganda 
in their entirety. He explained that Banyarwanda make one of 
the tribes of Uganda and they occupy the District of Kisoro 
which is part of Uganda. He therefore challenged the 
propagators of this lie to tell the people of Uganda what should 
be done about the District of Kisoro which is in Uganda. 
  Mr. Museveni strongly warned those people who go around 
trying to foment hatred among the people that they are not only 
violating the Constituent Assembly statute but they are also 
breaking the law. 
  On the issue of compensating the cattle which was eaten by 
the NRA [National Resistance Army] during the period of 
insurgency in the north, President Museveni assured the people 
that they will definitely be paid and that the money is now 
available and will be paid out in phases. [passage omitted] 
  The rally was also addressed by the former head of state, 
General Tito Okello Lutwa, who expressed happiness at being back 
home after years in exile. The general, who expressed total 
disgust with some of the brutal acts carried out by the rebels 
during the period of insurgency, called on the people of Gulu 
District and Acholis in general to unite and totally reject such 
inhuman acts. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In spite of its well-known, strong opposition to 
[the] movement's [National Resistance Movement, NRM] system of 
governance, the Uganda People's Congress, UPC, has admitted that 
the experience of Uganda dictates that the way forward demands 
reconciliation and accommodation of all political opinions. In 
a policy statement on the Constituent Assembly 1994 broadcast on 
Radio Uganda and Uganda television tonight by member of the 
Presidential Commission, the Rev. Dr. (Kefa Sempanje), the party 
asked the people of Uganda to commit themselves to long-term 
objectives which transcend narrow interests and can stand the 
test of time. 
  The UPC said the people of Uganda should commit themselves 
to: 
  1. Protect and preserve the territorial integrity of our 
beloved country and never permit it to be enslaved, dismembered, 
and enfeebled by militaristic systems; 
  2. Guarantee fundamental human rights and basic freedoms of 
the individual, particularly the enjoyment of the right of 
association. It said political parties should be entrenched in 
the Constitution in the promotion of democratic institutions; 
  3. Create an enabling environment for individuals to develop 
their full potential; and, 
  4. Build a strong and sound economy. 
  On governance, the party said the new constitution must 
guard 
against the emergence of leadership which comes to power through 
the gun or other criminal means. The Constitution, the UPC 
argued, should state clearly the tenure of office, the process 
of acquiring that tenure, its renewal and limitations. In other 
words, it added, the issue of regular elections should be 
entrenched in the Constitution with due dates and frequency 
specified. It said this should not be left to the whims of the 
executive. 
  The UPC also recommended that the role of the three arms of 
government, namely the executive, the legislature, and the 
judiciary should be defined. For good governance, the supremacy 
of the Constitution and the rule of law, it said, must be 
recognized and accepted. The will of the people as the ultimate 
sovereignty must be respected through regular elections based on 
universal adult suffrage. The National Assembly must be the 
depositary of the people's will and sovereignty. Its authority 
should not be undermined by any other body such as the National 
Council of State. 
  The party described the (?adoptive) draft Constitution as a 
tragic betrayal of the underlined principles in constitution 
making and the noble aspirations of the people of Uganda. It 
charged that the draft Constitution attempts to legitimize and 
entrench the NRM in power. It declared that the country must be 
committed to: 
  1. A constitution which is the supreme law of the land with 
no individual or organ above it. 
  2. Ensuring that the people's sovereignty is upheld at all 
times. 
  3. To establish constitutional modalities removing from 
office a president who fails to perform in accordance with the 
provisions of the constitution. 
  4. Maintaining the rule of law as opposed to arbitrary rule 
and 
  5. Safeguarding the independence of the judiciary. 
  On local government, [the] UPC added its voice to those of 
other parties who have already presented their views on the 
draft constitution in recognition of the need for unity in 
diversity and also it said that for effective provision of 
services to the people there is need for devolution of powers to 
local authorities, bearing in mind the need for equitable 
distribution of resources. But it stressed that the central 
government under the UPC will play a supportive, advisory, and 
supervisory role. However, the central government under the UPC 
will continue to play the exclusive role in the field of 
international relations, finance, defense, and security and 
management of the natural resources.

  [Text] Kampala, Feb 1 (AFP) -- Four Ugandans facing charges 
of involvement in smuggling arms to war-torn Yugoslavia in a 
Ugandan Airlines plane in August 1991 have been acquitted and 
discharged, court officials said here Tuesday [2 February]. 
  They said that those acquitted on Monday by Kampala's chief 
magistrate Yorokamu Bamwine included Uganda's former prime 
minister Abraham Waliggo, who then headed the state-owned 
Ugandan Airlines Corporation (UAC), two pilots Stephen Makyeri 
and Rogatiano Mugisha, and loadmaster David Nsubuga. But a 
fifth accused, Captain Jack Calnan, would continue standing 
trial for abuse of office. 
  At the time of the incident, UAC officials denied that the 
plane, which had been leased from Aviation Leasing Groups (ALG) 
of Kansas City in the United States, "was on Ugandan Airlines 
business when it was caught smuggling arms to Yugoslavia and 
impounded by the Yugoslav authorities". 
  The officials maintained that the ALG and UAC had agreed to 
temporarily suspend the lease between August 15 and October 15 
because the Uganda flag carrier did not need the plane during 
that period. 
  Under the agreement the Ugandan pilot Stephen Makyeri and 
his 
five compatriot crew members were to be retained by ALG during 
the period the lease was in suspension, the officials said. 
  Consequently, the plane left Uganda on August 29, 1991 for 
Gaborone in Botswana, but was diverted to the 
nominally-independent South African homeland of Bophuthatswana, 
where a Canadian citizen of Yugoslav origin, Anton Ikac, who had 
a Ugandan Airlines ticket, apparently boarded the plane and arms 
were loaded, the officials recounted. 
  It returned to Uganda's Entebbe international airport two 
days later carrying what was described as "technical cargo", 
taking off from Entebbe on the next day, but was forced to land 
at Zagreb in Yugoslavia, where it was found to be carrying 19 
tonnes of arms and ammunition. 
  According to the officials, money for refuelling the plane 
at 
Entebbe airport appeared to have been remitted to the Uganda 
branch of the British multi-national oil company, Shell-BP, from 
abroad, heightening suspicions here that senior officials of 
Uganda airlines were in on the deal. 
  A South African arms maker denied having supplied arms to 
separatists in the Yugoslav republic of Croatia as had then been 
claimed in a report in the London weekly SUNDAY TIMES.

  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 3 SAPA -- President F W de Klerk 
issued a call on all South Africans, regardless of present party 
membership, to unite and support the National Party's [NP] 
policies. Introducing the NP's manifesto at its federal congress 
on Thursday [3 February], he said only the NP possessed the 
experience, resources and expertise to meet the challenges ahead. 
  The ANC [African National Congress] had no experience of 
government, was toying with discredited policies which had 
brought disaster wherever they had been tried and its leadership 
included many SA Communist Party members with their own hidden 
agendas. 
  "I promised to lead the way to a new South Africa in which 
all would enjoy greater freedom. The transitional constitution, 
which has been negotiated by the NP, goes a long way toward 
fulfilling this promise. 
  "It extends full political and civil rights to those who 
previously did not have them and greatly strengthens the rights 
of those who did. 
  "I am calling on you to help the NP to defend, consolidate 
and build on the progress we have made." 
  He says historic challenges will face the country after the 
election including those of stimulating rapid economic growth, 
providing decent facilities for millions of South Africans and 
that of national reconciliation. Mr de Klerk says the NP is open 
to all who support the common vision of peace and security based 
on the rule of law, a non-racial democracy which will promote 
the dignity and full development of all, freedom of religion, 
sound economic policies which include a fair tax system, 
protection of minority rights and decent, affordable and 
efficient education, health care and social services. 
  "If you share this vision, then join me by voting for the 
NP. 
Work with us and support our vision for the future."

<F P=106> [By political correspondent Pierre Claassen] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 3 SAPA--A free and strong 
market-oriented economy for South Africa is the basis of the 
National Party's [NP] view for a peaceful and prosperous future. 
The economic route to prosperity as the party sees it is set out 
in a 36-page manifesto released at its federal congress at 
Kempton Park's World Trade centre on Thursday [3 February]. 
  Punting the NP as "the party for peace and prosperity," the 
manifesto states that peace can be achieved only if all people 
enjoyed prosperity. People and families could not be happy and 
prosperous without jobs, homes, education and proper health care. 
  "Only a free and strong economy can make jobs, houses, 
schools, hospitals, clinics and other good things possible," the 
NP says. It then sets out its view of the prerequisites for such 
an economy as being: 

  -  proper protection of private property; 
  -  investor confidence to build factories and create jobs; and 
  -  reasonable taxes as an incentive to harder work. 

    Dealing with the broad economic aspects in some detail, the 
manifesto stresses that a strong economy requires peace and 
justice in the workplace with the rights of both workers and 
employers properly protected. 
  Socialism and communism, as proved in Eastern Europe and in 
Africa, destroyed the economy, prosperity and jobs. 
  "Organisations and parties who still want socialism and 
communism do not really understand economics," the NP says. 
  Dealing with jobs, the NP claims credit for having created 
job opportunities by giving millions for small business 
development, deregulation, reduced taxation, bringing down 
inflation and export promotion. "The economic policies of the 
new National Party are attracting foreign investment, thereby 
creating more jobs. 
  "Only the NP can create more jobs," the manifesto claims. 
  On housing the party claims credit for making huge portions 
of land available for new urban settlement, helping more than a 
million families with a R[Rand]7,500 discount on buying a home, 
spending R550 million on subsidies for first time home owners 
and making R2,500 million available for housing in 1993 alone. 
  Furthermore, the manifesto claims credit for the government 
having introduced site and service schemes for a million 
families to build and upgrade homes in informal settlements. Its 
housing edownment scheme, launched last month, would motivate 
the private sector to participate in eliminating the 
underdevelopment of the past and deal with the needs of a 
growing population. 
  On education the party bemoans the fact that the nation had 
for too long been hampered by discrimination, a lack of 
discipline and a political struggle being waged in schools. 
  Again it claims credit for the new NP government having 
increased education funding by leaps and bounds in recent years, 
eliminating or significantly reducing discrepencies in funding, 
working towards a single department with regional 
decentralisation and the creation of a more autonomous school 
management system with parental participation. 
  The NP stood for a stable system which was just and equal 
for 
everyone and which provided for: 

  -  compulsory schooling for at least nine years; 
  -  vocational training; 
  -  relevant learning material and curricula; 
  -  international certification standards; 
  -  choice of mother tongue education; and 
  -  the option of language, culture and religion based state 
funded 
schools. 

    Dealing with the health aspect of prosperity, the NP claims 
credit for the advances and achievements of the present system 
and says the highest priority must remain on primary health care 
and the basic service be a function of local authorities. 
  Setting the year 2000 as a target, it then pledges to: 

  -  set up a local health committee for each community; 
  -  ensure there are enough clinics to provide access to health 
facilities for all; 
  -  affordable health care in public and private sectors; 
  -  immunisation programmes to provide 100 percent coverage; 
  -  extending feeding development programme; and 
  -  ensuring constructive cooperation between the public and 
private sectors. 

    The manifesto also contians a chapter on "prosperity and 
affirmative action," criticising discriminating laws, schooling 
systems and attitudes of the past and claiming credit for 
removing many and much of these. 
  The government was overcoming backlogs and opened up equal 
opportunities for all in the civil service. 
  It pledges itself to ensure that all individuals have equal 
access to opportunities for self-development and making the best 
possible contribution to the economy. "People who in the past 
did not have equal opportunities must receive special training, 
education and support so that they can develop fully and make 
their full contribution," is the party pledge to affirmative 
action. 
  Finally, the NP says, prosperity depends on relations with 
the world outside, on foreign investors building factories and 
creating jobs. 
  The NP's economic policies pleased the outside world and its 
reforms had lured trade and investment delegations and 
rejuvinated its sports ties and tourism. 
  The National Party would make South Africa a leader in 
southern Africa and the continent as it had much "to offer our 
brothers to the north."

  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 2 SAPA -- Neither the perpetrators 
of violence nor those who left the National Party [NP] in the 
lurch at negotiations, nor those threatening boycotts would 
prevent the party from completing its historic mission, State 
President F W de Klerk said on Wednesday [2 February]. "Nobody 
is going to prevent us from completing our historic mission or 
from running the full course -- not those who perpetrate 
violence, not those who left us in the lurch at the negotiation 
table when we needed them, not those who now want to boycott and 
threaten," he said. 
  Addressing the 2,000 delegates to the party's federal 
congress at a public meeting at the World Trade Centre in 
Kempton Park, Mr de Klerk said there was no turning back. "We 
will keep negotiating, before the election and after the 
election. We are prepared to make reasonable adjustments but 
will not allow ourselves to be blackmailed. 
  "Any attempt to create anarchy will be resisted with all our 
might." 
  He said the ANC [African National Congress] would cast the 
country back into the dark ages. "It is a party secretly 
controlled by communists, militants and extremists. They are 
quiet now, but they will shout loudly if the ANC wins control. 
  "Mr Mandela jokes that the next president might not come 
from 
the ANC, but it will be no joke if it is (SA Communist Party 
chairman) Mr Joe Slovo or Mrs Winnie Mandela." 
  The ANC had spelt out its plans but would not keep its 
promises, he said. "It cannot. It does not know how to and it 
has never done so. 
  "Mr Mandela and his party are searching for a new species of 
flora to finance its promises -- its called the money tree and 
banknotes grow on it to pay for the ANC's promises," said Mr de 
Klerk. 
  "I wish the ANC luck in their search, but I don't think 
they'll find anything because the money tree and the ANC 
Manifesto are both fantasies. 
  "Only fools believe in money trees and I do not believe the 
South African people are fools." 
  He promised the NP would stand by its supporters in the 
townships throughout the election campaign. The NP's opponents 
should know there were no no-go areas for Mr de Klerk or the NP. 
The party's voice would be heard. 
  The party's message was simply that it could be trusted, 
said 
Mr de Klerk. "In the face of the ANC's arrogant belief that it 
is going to win, I want to tell Mr Mandela that this is an 
election, not a coronation. The people have not yet spoken. The 
power is theirs, not yours." 
  Other parties wanting to put the ANC in its place should 
stop 
wasting energy by fighting the NP as well.

  [Text] Kempton Park Feb 3 SAPA--The African National 
Congress [ANC] had a hidden agenda and would revert to its old 
policies of centralism if it obtained too much power, State 
President F. W. de Klerk said on Thurdsay [3 February]. 
  Speaking at a press conference during the Natiomal Party's 
[NP] federal conference at Kempton Park, Mr de Klerk said the NP 
believed in a balance of power as well as the division of power 
to various levels of government. "The ANC made these 
concessions reluctantly, but they have a hidden agenda to revert 
to their old policies of centralism if they get too much power," 
he said. 
  The NP had refrained from making unachievable promises in 
its 
manifesto. "We say we will do what is possible within the 
bounds of what the country can afford. That is why we say that 
only if there is economic growth will we be able to build 
houses, schools and clinics. Because of fatal flaws in the 
ANC's policies, if they are approved, there will not be economic 
growth and their policies will not be worth the paper they are 
written on."

  [Text] Kempton Park Feb 3 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress [ANC] was still captive to the old ideology of 
communism which was as objectionable as apartheid, State 
President F. W. de Klerk said on Thursday [3 February] at a 
media conference in Kempton Park. "I have distanced myself from 
the wrongs of the past, but the ANC has not done so," he said. 
He was replying to a question about why he thought blacks would 
vote for him in the election. 
  "I think they will vote for me because so many blacks have 
told me they are going to do so. They will do so because the 
present situation in the townships is, to a great extent, due to 
the ANC, its youth league and their intimidation." 
  Referring to the provision of housing he said the ANC's 
actions had frightened the private sector out of housing 
development in the townships. "If it was not for these actions 
of the ANC we could have produced many houses, but the ANC does 
not want us to get the credit. That is why people in the 
townships have been robbed of development."

<F P=106> [By political correspondent Pierre Claassen] </F>
  [Text] Kempton Park Feb 3 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress [ANC] has not yet produced a proposal on a two-ballot 
option, but if such a move will bring the Freedom Alliance [FA] 
on board, the government will accept it, says Constitutional 
Development Minister Roelf Meyer. 
  He was asked on Thursday [3 February] for comment on reports 
that the ANC National Executive Committee had given its 
negotiators a mandate to offer the double ballot to the FA in a 
further round of constitutional talks scheduled for later in the 
day. "At present there is no firm proposal yet. When it comes 
we will have to look at it," he said. 
  Mr Meyer did not deny that the proposal was in the offing, 
but said much depended on the context within which it was made. 
He said the government in principle had always favoured a 
double ballot, "but for pragmatic reasons we favour a single 
ballot in this election". 
  "However, if a double ballot will bring about an all 
inclusive settlement, then we will support it," Mr Meyer told 
SAPA while attending the NP's [National Party] one-day federal 
congress at the World Trade Centre in Kempton Park. 
  Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel and Home Affairs 
Minister 
Danie Schutte said they understood the two-ballot offer was 
imminent and that ANC negotiators had even more to offer than 
just the compromise on the ballot. Both men were confident that 
progress would be made in what may be the last round of 
three-way talks between the parties in Pretoria. 
  "I understand the ANC negotiators have been given an ample 
mandate and that we will be able to do something," Mr Schutte 
said. 
  At a news conference on the NP's [National Party] election 
manifesto, NP leader F.W. de Klerk confirmed the government's 
position on the ballot issue, saying its commitment to a single 
ballot came about as a result of more important concesssion 
having been "traded" with the ANC [African National Congress] in 
December. 
  There were other issues at stake, however, and the 
government 
would present its own package of proposals to Thursday's talks. 
He said the government had started out in favour of a double 
ballot and was therefore not against it in principle. "But in 
the final throes of the negotiations here (at the World Trade 
Centre) the negotiation council reached agreements on points of 
difference which were more important to us than the double 
ballot. And because we got important concessions, we said we 
would accpt one ballot. If we move back to a double ballot 
then, in a sense, we will get what we wanted originally." 
  Mr de Klerk said that his signing of the the election 
promulgation on Wednesday did not proclude further amendments to 
the constitution. "It is a wrong perception that we cannot 
change the constitution anymore -- I had that specially checked 
-- but there are time constraints. We cannot do so in March, 
but we can do so in the next week to ten days," he said.

<F P=106> [By political correspondent Pierre Claassen] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 3 SAPA -- Constitutional 
Development Minister Roelf Meyer has warned the National Party 
[NP] federal congress against high expectations for Thursday's 
[3 February] constitutional negotiations with the Freedom 
Alliance. The talks are scheduled to start around midday. 
  Mr Meyer spoke on the NP's manifesto released earlier and 
said expections had been raised by media reports around the next 
round of talks. "It is important not to expect too much at this 
stage," he said. 
  A four-point constitutional package, including a double 
ballot, is to be put to the Freedom Alliance on Thursday in a 
final attempt for an inclusive negotiated settlement. The double 
ballot offer by the African National Congress [ANC] -- 
potentially a breakthrough -- has not been seen yet and Mr Meyer 
expressed caution on the matter. He told SAPA he would prefer to 
evaluate it within the full context of any ANC proposal. 
  If the new package succeeds, negotiators said Parliament was 
ready to be convened for a one-day session next week to amend 
the transitional constitution and the electoral act. 
  Deputy Constitutional Development Minister Fanus Schoeman 
confirmed that a new and "definitely final" offer had been 
cobbled together by the ANC and the government which he felt 
substantially accommodated all the Freedom Alliance's demands. 
The double ballot offer, approved by the ANC's National 
Executive on Tuesday night, would remove what had become 
identified as the most problematic obstacle to any agreement, he 
said. 
  Mr Schoeman said deadlock reached at the last round of talks 
with the alliance on Monday had resulted in an all-round, 
all-out attempt to find a solution. Substantial agreement had 
already been achieved on three of the issues which concerned 
provincial powers and functions, provincial taxation autonomy 
and constitutional autonomy for provinces, tying in the problems 
of the demand for an Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland] and the 
position of the Zulu king. 
  The government had made a proposal which offered the 
Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front] an option which 
could ultimately accommodate its volkstaat goal.

<F P=106> [Statement by Dumisani Makhaye, ANC southern Natal media </F>
officer, on SAPA PR Wire Service on 2 February] 
  [Text] The African National Congress [ANC] in Natal is not 
surprised by the appearance in the National Party [NP] list for 
the Natal provincial legislature of names of some long 
discredited personalities. Surely, the NP regards Natal, with 
about 25 percent of national votes, as crucial for the April 27 
elections. Therefore its Natal list of candidates is the best 
the NP can offer. 
  If the best that can be fielded by the NP includes people 
like George Bartlett, Con Botha and Valentin Volker, then the NP 
is the party of yesterday. The people of Natal in particular and 
those of the whole country in general cannot forget the mess 
that was caused by Bartlett in the Department of Transport and 
the recent petrol increases. The people of Natal will not 
forgive Con Botha for refurbishing a beach front apartment for 
himself at Addington hospital at an exorbitant price using 
taxpayers' money when thousands of patients were without 
hospital beds and sufficient medicines at the hospitals. 
  The corruption of some of the people appearing in the NP 
list 
is the mirror of the corruption of the NP as a whole. The list 
is conservative and Afrikaner male dominated. That is the true 
character of the NP which is conservative and male chauvinist. 
  The NP excuse that the reason that the few blacks appearing 
on its list is because of intimidation in the black areas is a 
big lie. The NP does not trust blacks and conversely the 
oppressed masses cannot trust the NP -- the party of apartheid. 
What intimidates blacks from the NP is its apartheid policies 
which caused and still cause havoc among black communities. 
Anyway, it was the Group Areas Act of the NP that forcibly 
separated residential areas along racial and ethnic lines. 
  Those few token NP black candidates appearing in the list 
are 
not even known in their communities. Obviously, a party of 
apartheid cannot hope to attract oppressed personalities of any 
substance. The NP can only rely on those elements who benefitted 
from apartheid. 
  The ANC's Reconstruction and Development Programme is aimed 
at reconstructing the economy which was destroyed by some of the 
very people appearing on the NP list. The people of Natal dare 
not vote these forces of destruction.

  [Text] Paarl Feb 2 SAPA -- Complacency among African 
National Congress [ANC] supporters was the greatest danger which 
threatened an election victory for the organisation in the 
forthcoming election, ANC President Nelson Mandela said on 
Wednesday [2 February]. Addressing about 8,000 enthusiastic 
supporters at Dal Josaphat stadium in Paarl in the Western Cape, 
he said opinion polls had consistently shown that the ANC was 
the most popular organisation in the country and that it would 
win an outright victory if an election were held now. 
  "The party that follows us in comparative strength is 
nothing 
more than a Mickey Mouse. But the greatest danger to democracy 
is you, the supporters of the ANC." Mr Mandela said the ANC had 
to ensure that every one of its supporters would be able to vote 
and to achieve that, activists had to work very hard. 
  Earlier the ANC leader praised Justice Minister Kobie 
Coetsee, saying Mr Coetsee had had "the courage and vision" to 
initiate discussions between himself and former President P W 
Botha while Mr Mandela was still in Victor Verster Prison. 
  Mr Mandela also thanked the community of Paarl for their 
support while he was held at Victor Verster and praised a number 
of white warders who had treated him with sensitivity and 
kindness. 
  The ANC leader was wildly applauded when he arrived at the 
packed stadium and circled the track on the back of a bakkie 
[pickup truck] waving to the crowd. Mr Mandela was presented 
with a symbolic freedom torch which had been lit outside Victor 
Verster prison on Wednesday morning and carried to the stadium 
by runners. 
  Crowds lined the streets of Paarl and many shops were closed 
as the ANC leader's entourage passed through the town on its way 
to the stadium.

stand taken by certain members of its parliamentary caucus who 
no longer wish to fight the election under the ANC [African 
National Congress] banner. 
  Yesterday a number of dissatisfied Labor Party 
parliamentarians threatened protest action unless a congress 
decision in this regard is repealed. An LP spokesman, Mr. Peter 
Hendrickse, said the party had decided unanimously at its recent 
congress to fight the election under the ANC banner and said the 
five caucus members who now wished to have the resolution 
revoked had not raised objections to the resolution at the time.

  The whites have an inalienable right to retain Pretoria for 
the Afrikaner/Boer homeland. There is no way that Pretoria will 
become a part state. The Afrikaner people are being called on 
to engage in actions directed at drastic, nonviolent resistance 
so that they can really choke the negotiation forum until the 
Afrikaner homeland is in place. He is appealing to the 
Afrikaner people to trust their leaders and not to lose hope. 
  The white man, and in particular the Boer/Afrikaner, is 
facing the biggest crisis of his history. The future of 
Pretoria and the country is not in anybody else's hands, but in 
those of the whites. That is why they have to prevent the 
takeover of Pretoria by an ANC [African National Congress] 
civics regime. 
  The new transitional Constitution holds drastic results in 
store for the country at the local level. The only option that 
the transitional council can implement regarding Pretoria is the 
50/50 system with mixed city councils. The communists and 
Antichrist will then rule the city. 
  Fouche said the whites are no longer affected by this 
horror. 
The Boer/Afrikaner has to awaken other whites by communicating 
to them the seriousness of the situation. 
  The new Constitution has so many loopholes that it could be 
possible to avert a tragedy. The negotiation forum must make 
the Constitution and its conditions enforceable in Pretoria and 
decide on the number of members the new metropolitan city 
council will have to consist of. 
  The 17 CP city council members do not recognize the present 
forum in Pretoria as it has been established prematurely, and 
the transitional Constitution at local level is not as yet 
operative. The forum has no legal capabilities and its decisions 
are unacceptable. 
  The Conservative Party's arm in local government is the 
Transvaal Municipal Association which has succeeded in getting 
all city councils from group eight down to retain their status 
quo during the pre-interim period. It did not only get it right 
for the CP-controlled city councils, but also for 94 percent of 
all city councils in South Africa. 
  The National Party councilors were keen to jump on this 
wagon 
and were relieved to be able to retain their autonomy. A 
National Party-controlled city council, such as Beaufort West, 
has asked Fouche to explain this part of the Constitution to 
them because they want to be governed by whites.

  [Text] Ottosdal, Western Transvaal, Feb 3 SAPA -- Two 
people were slightly injured when an explosion seriously damaged 
the African National Congress [ANC] office in Letsopa township 
near Ottosdal in the Western Transvaal before day-break on 
Thursday [3 February], police said. 
  Several shops in the town were petrol-bombed shortly after 
the blast and police have offered R[rand] 10,000 for information 
leading to the arrest of the attackers. Police spokesman 
Maj-Gen Tokkie Nienaber said damage to the ANC office was 
estimated at R80,000 and several surrounding houses were damaged 
in the 1.15 AM explosion. The kind of explosives used was still 
unkown. 
  Elsie Manoe, 46, suffered burn wounds to her hip and Katrien 
Salabane, 14, was injured in her left thumb, said Gen Nienaber. 
The interiors of three shops in the predominantly Asian 
business centre of Koranna Fontein were gutted when unidentified 
attackers broke the windows and hurled six petrol bombs into the 
premises at about 1.20 AM. No-one was hurt in the petrol bomb 
attacks. 
  The ANC's [African National Congress] Western Transvaal 
branch called on the government to investigate the blast as well 
as the proliferation of commercial explosives in the Western 
Transvaal region. 
  Two powerful bomb explosions ripped through the offices of 
two trade unions in Klerksdorp, also in the Western Transvaal, 
and one damaged offices in Harrismith in the Orange Free State 
on Wednesday. The blasts were believed to have been caused by 
commercial explosives.

  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 2 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party 
[IFP] supporters ruled the streets of Thokoza on Wednesday [2 
Wednesday] as they marched to protest against the withdrawal of 
the police's Internal Stability Division [ISD] from East Rand 
townships and its replacement by SA Defence Force [SADF] troops 
-- announced on Tuesday in the release of the peace plan for the 
region. While most peacefully demonstrated down Khumalo Street, 
a small criminal element from the Thokoza hostel looted shops, 
robbed street vendors, stoned passing cars, intimidated the 
elderly and stripped cars. 
  IFP supporters who sat on the Khumalo Street bridge refused 
an invitation by SADF regional commanding officer Cmdt Michael 
de Goede to be part of SADF policing. The IFP believes black 
SADF soldiers sent to Thokoza are in cahoots with the African 
National Congress [ANC] and has cited situations where the SADF 
has allegedly harassed and even killed IFP supporters. 
  "I want to work closely with you. You can even work with my 
soldiers on patrol," Cmdt de Goede said, appealing to the 
militant crowd to give the SADF a chance to create peace and 
stability. 
  The crowd called for "stability, stability" and refused to 
negotiate with Cmdt de Goede. They told him if the ISD had to 
go, the SADF should be removed as well. One angry man said: "We 
would rather be left to fight it out to the death with the ANC. 
At least then we will have a fair chance." 
  Roads into Thokoza were heavily blockaded by SADF troops on 
Wednesday, while IFP supporters set up their own blockades with 
taxis inside the township. 
  Hundreds of terrified pensioners collecting their money were 
trapped inside the Thokoza Town Council offices while IFP 
supporters, armed with pangas, axes, knobkerries and steel bars, 
threatened to rob them. Payment of pensions totalling more that 
R[Rand]3 million was postponed until Thursday, the venue was 
transferred to Wadeville in Germiston and the pensioners were 
escorted home by SADF troops. 
  Violence nearly erupted when ANC supporters celebrating the 
ISD's announced withdrawal marched to the foot of the bridge to 
confront the IFP gathering. The IFP supporters and SADF troops 
took cover when shots were fired from the residential area but 
nobody was injured or arrested. Cars forced to stop at the taxi 
blockade were stripped. 
  Reporters watched while a masked man and his gang smashed 
car 
windows and made off with radios, tape-decks and tyres. 
  Taxis passing on the highway were stoned and street vendors 
were chased away and their stalls were looted. 
  IFP Transvaal Chairman Themba Khoza, in the township to 
quell 
the unrest and negotiate with the police, said the impromptu 
gathering was the consequence of the ANC and government making 
decisions without consulting the IFP. He was referring to the 
East Rand peace plan. 
  An eight-member task group has been appointed to oversee the 
plan, but so far the IFP has refused invitations to join the 
peace process. 
  East Rand Deputy Commissioner Maj-Gen Obie Oberholzer told 
the IFP crowd police had not taken the decision to remove the 
ISD from the area. "It was a political decision and I suggest 
your leaders consult other political leaders," he said. 
  The crowd, waving posters which read "The TEC [Transitional 
Executive Council] has fed us to the SADF" and "Umkhonto we 
Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- MK] are back to kill us", 
dispersed only when Mr Khoza agreed to set up an urgent meeting 
with government ministers. 
  By late afternoon the area was still tense with IFP members 
standing guard at Thokoza hostel, while residents gathered 
across the road. A large SADF contingent with rifles at the 
ready separated the two factions and armoured cars filled with 
soldiers waited at street corners.

  [Text] Pretoria Feb 2 SAPA--The East Rand peace plan could 
lead to the African National Congress [ANC] implementing ethnic 
cleansing in the townships, the Afrikaner Volksfront [National 
Front--AVF] said on Wednesday [2 February]. 
  The AVF said it supported the Inkatha Freedom Party's 
rejection of the peace plan, which entailed the withdrawal of 
the SA Police's Internal Stability Division [ISD] from East Rand 
townships. 
  AVF Press Secretary Stephen Maninger said the composition of 
SA Defence Force [SADF] units which would replace the ISD would 
be advantageous to the African National Congress. There had 
been past complaints that black troops, which comprised the 
majority of the SADF's permanent force, openly chanted pro-ANC 
slogans and often insulted IFP supporters by referring to IFP 
President Mangosuthu Buthelezi as a dog. 
  The implementation of the East Rand peace plan could lead to 
the ANC implementing ethnic cleansing in townships, he said. 
The so-called ensuing peace would not result in an absence of 
violence but of ANC opponents, Mr Maninger said. 
  State President F. W. de Klerk's acceptance of the peace 
plan 
was not surprising, because he had decided to no longer oppose 
ANC decisions. The norm was that President de Klerk yielded to 
ANC pressure, Mr Maninger said.

  [Text] Ciskei, which has decided to contest South Africa's 
first all-race election, has been excluded from the country's 
decisionmaking bodies after failing to apply in time for 
membership of the Transitional Executive Council [TEC]. The TEC 
said in a statement in Pretoria that Ciskei had been given until 
midday on 28 January to apply for membership of the body but had 
failed to do so. Earlier, Ciskei withdrew from the Freedom 
Alliance, which remains opposed to the 26-28 April election. 
Ciskei's failure to apply for membership of the TEC means that 
its troops will have to withdraw from the multiparty National 
Peacekeeping Force, which began training near Bloemfontein on 24 
January.

Venda has ground to a virtual halt as the strike by some 24,000 
government employees entered its fourth week. The protest is to 
highlight demands that former Venda military ruler Brig Gabriel 
Ramushwana pay back about R[rand]1.6 million he is accused of 
siphoning from government coffers. Brig Ramushwana has been 
chosen to command the national peacekeeping force being moulded 
in Bloemfontein. 
  All schools in Venda closed on Monday this week in the wake 
of the strike. The homeland's Department of Finance has said no 
pay cheques will be issued for February as the master computer 
has been switched off.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  `Partial Endorsement' of East Rand Peace Plan -- 
Johannesburg 
THE STAR in English on 3 February in a page-12 editorial 
contends that the peace plan announced by President de Klerk and 
African National Congress (ANC) President Nelson Mandela "merits 
partial endorsement only." First, the plan "has not won the 
approval of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], mainly because of 
the decision to withdraw policemen from the Internal Stability 
Division [ISD] and replace them with Defence Force units. The 
IFP has described the withdrawal of ISD men as a `treacherous 
betrayal' of undertakings given by De Klerk." THE STAR believes 
the IFP "is a force in the townships," and its grievances are 
therefore "a cause for concern." The second "major weakness" is 
the plan's "failure to deal with the question of ANC-aligned 
self-defence units, whose reputation as predatory vigilantes was 
underlined by the Goldstone Commission late last year. The 
omission accentuates suspicion of bias in favour of the ANC." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  ANC Doubts About Relationship With Thebe Corporation -- "It 
is appropriate that the announcement of the African Life deal 
occurred in the same week as ANC President Nelson Mandela, 
belatedly, gave the first official indication that his 
organisation was developing doubts about its relationship with 
the Thebe Investment Corporation," declares a page-10 editorial 
in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 3 February. "Mandela 
clearly identified the Thebe problem on Monday when he conceded 
it would be undesirable for a company to be closely associated 
with a governing party, or for that party to control a large 
corporation which would be competing with other businesses." 
"The African Life initiative is a conscious attempt to expand 
black economic influence and control in the sphere of 'big 
business'. And it occurs without the artificial buttresses, 
such as quotas and government favours, which often give 
affirmative action activities an initial boost but leave them 
ill-equipped to deal with the real world. Thebe's prospects 
will be immeasurably improved if it adopts a similar method." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  `Big Flaw' in East Rand Peace Plan -- Johannesburg SOWETAN 
in 
English on 3 February in a page-10 editorial sees a "big flaw" 
in the East Rand peace plan unveiled by President F.W. de Klerk 
and Nelson Mandela because the IFP did not participate in the 
conception and implementation of the plan. SOWETAN has "always 
argued" that "poverty and the abject living conditions" in areas 
like Katlehong and Thokoza "are at the root of the violence." 
The peace plan "obviously needs the consent and co-operation of 
all those involved in the conflict to succeed. Gaining the 
support of IFP members is therefore a prerequisite." The "onus 
is now on the newly deployed SADF units to assuage the fears of 
IFP members by acting against the perpetrators of violence in a 
non-partisan and unbiased manner and affording protection to all 
township residents."

  [Text] Addis Ababa, 1 Feb. (PANA)--The Organisation of 
African Unity (OAU) has expressed grave concern over about the 
heavy debt burden of African countries which continued to 
undermine the growth and development of most countries. In a 
report to the 59th ordinary session of the OAU Council of 
Ministers on Tuesday, the OAU said Africa's debt stood at 275.15 
billion U.S. dollars at the end of 1992. 
  Even though the figures for 1993 are not yet out, the 
organisation says "it is certain that their magnitude will not 
have lowered to the desired level in order to relieve African 
countries of the debt overhang". Since 1985, when member states 
adopted the common position on Africa's debt, it has risen from 
184.89 billion dollars to 275.15 billion dollars in 1992, an 
increase of 49 percent. At the same time there has been a 
continuing decline of resource flow. 
  "The situation is all the more alarming if one were to 
compare the total debt to total exports or total gross domestic 
product (GDP)" observed the OAU. For example, the debt/export 
ratio increased from 361 percent in 1990 to 373 percent in 1992. 
The debt service ratio to exports also increased from 30.1 
percent to 35 percent during the same period. 
  "The severity of the debt burden on each and every African 
country is significant especially if one takes into 
consideration the ability to repay under the circumstances of 
declining export receipts coupled with successive devaluations 
of African currencies". 
  The OAU noted that the socio-economic conditions of the 
majority of member states did not show any significant 
improvement in 1993 in spite of the reform-driven policies which 
have been introduced by governments since the beginning of the 
1980s. Most economic indicators in 1993 showed a general poor 
performance of African economies. At the 1990 prices, Africa's 
GDP which grew at two percent in 1991, declined sharply to 0.7 
percent in 1992, but picked up in 1993 when it recorded a mere 
1.4 percent. 
  The main factors contributing to Africa's poor economic 
performance include the deterioration of the terms of trade, 
depressed commodity prices, low levels of investment, political 
instability and inappropriate macro-economic policies.

  [Text] In Angola, the government forces are losing their 
patience: If the UNITA [National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola] attacks continue, the Army is prepared 
to launch large-scale offensive operations. 
  This warning was given today by General Joao de Matos, chief 
of the Armed Forces General Staff, who urged the population to 
arm themselves because the war is far from over. 
  [Begin Matos recording] My hope is that the Angolan people 
will be on their guard and that they will arm and organize 
themselves in preparation for very difficult times, because 
UNITA will continue waging war. [end recording] 
  Joao de Matos further stated that there has been no progress 
whatsoever at the peace talks and that UNITA is only using them 
to play for time. 
  [Begin Matos recording] We in the Armed Forces are beginning 
to lose our patience. The negotiations have been going on for 
so many months, and we in the Armed Forces note that there has 
been no significant progress. Despite statements to the 
contrary that have been made, all that is happening in Lusaka is 
mere propaganda. Now, for example, UNITA has agreed to resolve 
the question of the police force, but, in our opinion, this was 
basically and solely because the UN Security Council was about 
to meet. Now UNITA will continue to play its game, to play for 
time, until the next Security Council meeting. [end recording] 
  Joao de Matos was speaking to reporters prior to departing 
for Brazil where he will be negotiating arms supplies for the 
Luanda government.

friends, to remain dignified and calm at this painful moment of 
separation. Our ability to perpetuate his action will depend 
upon our courage and determination to follow the path toward 
peace and development paved by the great deceased . 
  Fellow Ivorians, the world is watching us. It is together, 
in peace, brotherhood, solidarity, and love that we will be able 
to ensure the continuity of his gigantic work. 
  Let us all pray for the repose of his soul!

  [Text] Johannesburg 2 Feb SAPA--Trilateral talks involving 
the government, the African National Congress [ANC] and the 
Freedom Alliance are scheduled to resume on Thursday [3 
February] with the issue of a double or single ballot at the top 
of the agenda. 
  Both government and ANC spokesman indicated on Wednesday 
that 
they regarded the choice of a single ballot as a practical 
choice and not an issue of principle. On Tuesday the furore 
over the issue was joined by Anglo American Corporation Chairman 
Julian Ogilvie-Thompson and the South African Chamber of 
Business, both of whom warned that continued ANC and government 
intransigence on the issue could endanger the April election. 
  ANC President Nelson Mandela and senior ANC negotiators have 
said the ballot issue was not negotiable. 
  ANC spokeswoman Gill Marcus said on Wednesday that the ANC's 
preference for a single ballot was not based on considerations 
of principle. She said the ANC would prefer a double ballot 
under ideal circumstances. However, a double ballot could 
create practical problems, not the least of which were 
widespread voter confusion. "We would ideally like a double 
ballot. It is not a matter of principle. If you can address 
the practical problems we would be prepared to support it," Ms 
Marcus said. She stressed, however, that this was not a comment 
on specific discussions taking place but rather an outlook on 
the question in general. 
  A government spokesman said government did also not regard 
its preference for a single ballot as a matter of principle. 
"Government is pragmatic on this issue and we are willing to 
discuss it." 
  A Freedom Alliance source said while the ANC's conceding to 
a 
double ballot would greatly improve relations between the 
alliance and the ANC, it would not necessarily be sufficient to 
bring the alliance into the constitutional process. He said the 
Inkatha Freedom Party was the major force behind alliance 
demands for a double ballot. 
  The ANC's National Executive Committee (NEC) met on Tuesday 
to discuss an alliance package of proposals placed before it at 
talks on Monday night. The package was substantially the same 
as the package of December last year which included proposed 
changes to the interim constitution as well as a concession on 
the ballot issue. The NEC's response would be conveyed to the 
government and the alliance at their meeting on Thursday.

  [Text] Bujumbura, Feb 3 (AFP) -- Burundi's president elect 
Cyprien Ntaryamira and opposition parties launched talks here 
late Thursday [3 February] to end five days of tribal and 
political conflict in which at least 45 people have been killed. 
  The two sides, together with two bishops, two top army 
officers and the representatives of the UN and Organisation of 
African Unity will seek to bring the landlocked East African 
state "back from the brink," said UN special representative 
Ahmedou Ould Abdallah. 
  The two sides would not split up before settling the problem 
of who should succeed president Melchior Ndadaye, assassinated 
in a failed military coup on October 21, Ould-Abdallah added. 
  Political and tribal violence flared in the capital after 
the 
government sacked five members of the constitutional commission 
Saturday. The commission is expected to rule on the legitimacy 
of Ntaryamira's designation as president on 13 Janaury. 
  The opposition, led by Sylvie Kinigi, is contesting the 
nomination by the national assembly. 
  Ntaryamira, the former agriculture minister, comes from the 
same majority Hutu tribe as the assassinated president. 
Burundi's army, and until recently its top political posts, are 
dominated by the minority Tutsi tribe.

has just dismissed 81 new teachers, bringing to 150 the total 
number of teachers dismissed for striking, it was learned from 
official sources in Yaounde today. These teachers from high 
schools in the public sector, who had been on strike since 24 
November to back demands for better salaries, were hit by the 
measure after their supervisors reported their "irregular 
absence." On 23 January, 73 other high school teachers were 
dismissed for similar reasons. The previous day, the government 
had issued a recruitment notice to cope with the possible 
refusal of teachers to resume work.

  [Text] The epilogue to the 22-year-old territorial dispute 
between Chad and Libya has been written: The Aouzou Strip well 
and truly belongs to Chad. This sums up the verdict issued by 
the International Court of Justice [ICJ] of the Hague. There 
were 16 votes for and only one -- obviously that of the 
temporary Libyan judge -- against. The ICJ's ruling is of 
course satisfactory to Chadian President Idriss Deby: 
  [Begin recording] [Deby] The most important thing for us, 
under the circumstances, is that the law has been applied and 
also that this problem, which lasted too long and cost so many 
human lives, has been resolved peacefully. I am therefore happy 
with the outcome.... 
  [Mohamed Youssoufou Saliou, interrupting] Mr. President, do 
you think that Libya will comply with this verdict, this 
important decision by the ICJ? 
  [Deby] I believe so. Yes, I certainly believe, and, I would 
even say, I am convinced that Libya will keep its promises 
before the ICJ. From the moment when we jointly agreed to 
submit ourselves to the arbitration of the ICJ, we made a 
promise. Therefore, based on this promise, I am convinced that 
Libya will keep its promises to the ICJ. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] President Idriss Deby, who made a short working 
visit to Nigeria this morning, has just returned home to 
Ndjamena. During his visit he met with his Nigerian counterpart, 
General Sani Abacha, in Abuja. On his return to Ndjamena, the 
president was welcomed by the prime minister and other members 
of his government. Let us listen to President Deby outlining the 
purpose of his visit to Abuja: 
  [Begin recording] [Deby] We decided to pay a short visit to 
Nigeria as part of the efforts to develop the friendly relations 
of cooperation existing between both countries. This visit had 
become necessary after the changes that took place in that 
country and especially after the devaluation of the CFA franc in 
our country. It must be noted that, as far as trade with Chad is 
concerned, Nigeria is an extremely important country. Most of 
the trade between the two countries takes place in an informal 
way. We, therefore, decided to pay this visit to discuss all 
these issues in order to formalize our commercial activities. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Your Excellency, concerning the 
devaluation of the CFA franc, in concrete terms, what economic 
benefits can Chad expect from Nigeria? 
  [Deby] [Words indistinct] and even on this specific point, 
Nigeria is an oil-producing country. We have great difficulties 
in this specific field, so we expressed the wish to see Nigeria 
helping us to procure this product. What we are expecting from 
the Nigerian authorities is a positive reaction to our request.

<F P=106> [Speech by Prime Minister Casimir Oye-Mba to members of the </F>
National Assembly in Libreville on 2 February--live] 
  [Excerpts] Mr. Speaker of the National Assembly, members of 
the National Assembly, ministers, Your Excellencies, ladies and 
gentlemen: First, I would like to express my sincere thanks to 
the National Assembly which has given me the opportunity today 
to speak at this extraordinary session about a burning current 
issue that concerns the future of our country. [passage omitted] 
  It is, indeed, at the request of government that we have met 
here today to report on the devaluation of the CFA franc. In a 
democratic regime, when there is an exceptional national or 
international event with very important financial, economic, 
social, and, of course, economic repercussions, it is normal for 
the head of government to come and discuss it directly with the 
National Assembly in order to take its viewpoint into account. 
[passage omitted] 
  Mr. Speaker, members of the National Assembly, I will not 
hide the fact--it was widely reported in the media--that 
officially, Gabon was not in favor of this measure. However, we 
were forced to consider the fact that our partners were 
faced--like us, and perhaps more than us--with enormous economic 
and financial difficulties. It is also in place to say that in 
this affair the pressure exerted by the IMF and the World Bank, 
with the support of France was so strong that our country was 
finally obliged to fall in line with the other partners to avoid 
the dislocation of the franc zone. Making a different decision 
would have led us into an adventure with incalculable 
consequences on the development of our country. I therefore 
feel more at ease to say at this juncture that there was really 
no other choice for our country. [passage omitted] 
  It is perhaps useful now to trace the causes of the 
devaluation. Why was this decision made? This measure that we 
are obliged to accept collectively is the consequence of the 
financial and economic imbalances that have been facing all 
member countries of the franc zone for about six years now. 
Indeed, the zone has been plunged into an unprecedented 
recession which has resulted since 1986 in a nominal growth rate 
of not higher than 1 percent for all these countries as against 
a growth rate of over 3 percent for the other West and Central 
African countries which are not members of the franc zone. Such 
a situation could not continue without very serious damage to 
the economic and social progress of our countries, especially as 
we know that the economic takeoff of countries in the franc zone 
supposes a growth rate of about 5 to 6 percent per annum. 
  Still referring to 1986, it is estimated that for these 
member countries, the real income per capita fell by an average 
of 5 percent per annum. In the same period, investments 
declined to a record level of 6.5 percent per annum. All these 
indicators clearly show the worsening deterioration in the 
competitiveness of our countries which have been facing 
increasing recession for 10 years now. We can even say that 
some of them are now practically bankrupt. 
  To prove how I have reached this conclusion, it is enough to 
observe that even in some oil producing countries like ours, 
civil servants are no longer paid regularly. Fortunately, that 
is not the case in our country. At the same time, there is a 
massive flight of capital and the collapse of the banking system 
in these countries, while the enterprises are faced with 
increasingly inextricable treasury problems. In such a context, 
the governments are reduced to only preoccupying themselves with 
financial imbalances, that is everyday treasury problems, to the 
detriment of the social sectors and the medium- and long-term 
development objectives. Furthermore, most of these countries 
can no longer honor their external bilateral and multilateral 
commitments. 
  If we must admit that the worsening situation of our 
economic and social environment was caused by the inappropriate 
nature of certain macroeconomic policies that resulted in levels 
of consumption and investment that far exceeded available 
resources, it is also very valid to note that the unfavorable 
international context demonstrated by the continuing fall in the 
prices of raw materials has had a decisive impact on the 
economies of these countries which is particularly aggravating. 
May I remind you that the devaluation of the CFA franc happened 
within the context of acute and general deterioration of the 
terms of trade and the clear preference of the French franc to 
the dollar, the currency in which our exports are invoiced. If 
there was any need to show the importance of external factors on 
the economy of Gabon, I would simply give some parameters that 
influence the development of activities in our country. They 
are startling. 
  From 1986 to 1992, oil prices steadily fell by 61 percent. 
Last year, Gabon produced about 14.5 million tonnes of oil. 
With this production level, we earned about half what we earned 
in 1985-86, when oil production in our country was about 6 to 7 
million tonnes. Therefore, 14.5 tonnes of oil today fetches 
about half what 6 to 7 million tonnes of oil brought us in 
1985-86. From 1986 to 1991, the global deterioration of the 
terms of trade for Gabon was about 50 percent. The same goes 
for practically all African countries that belong to the franc 
zone. The figures I have just given also apply to countries 
like Cote d'Ivoire and Cameroon for cocoa and coffee production. 
  In addition to this economically and financially unfavorable 
context for our country, the overevaluation rate of our CFA 
franc made it one of the weakest in the area. It was lower than 
20 percent for our country, while, for other member countries, 
it crossed the threshold of 50 percent. It became clear that 
the cost incurred by maintaining the status quo, namely the 
former exchange rate, was no longer bearable. Many authorized 
or less authorized voices made this known in various ways. 
[passage omitted] 
  Mr. Speaker, honorable legislators, it is no secret for 
anyone that the Gabonese authorities were against the 
devaluation. The president of the Republic and I had said this 
clearly and publicly because we knew that contrary to countries 
like Cameroon or Cote d'Ivoire, the economic structure of Gabon 
presents less room for adaptability. However, the devaluation 
is now a fact and we must live with it. With our partners in 
particular, we must examine the compensatory measures that were 
announced and promised in Dakar regarding the amounts of 
canceled debts. We must also examine the measures for increased 
mobilization of influx of concessional financing. On this very 
point, it is legitimate to recall that, thanks to President 
Bongo's strong action, our country has already been able to 
obtain some significant measures from France concerning the 
reduction of the debt burden. We hope more will be done. It 
appears that some of the doubts can only be cleared after 
negotiations with the IMF which, as you know, is currently 
present in Libreville. 
  If we examine the short-term trade prospects, it seems 
probable that our CFA franc income will increase as a result of 
the conversion of our export earnings in foreign exchange. It 
will have a temporary impact on export activities and budget 
income that are mainly based on the influx of external trade. 
However, everyone can well notice that the structure of our 
production apparatus remains particularly dependent on imports 
that are practically impossible to do away with. It is also 
established that regarding our export earnings, Gabon, even if 
it so desired, cannot fully benefit from the volume of 
production, that is the medium- or long-term increase in 
quantity of exports that is usually expected after a devaluation 
for the following reasons: Oil, whose production is controlled 
by petroleum exporting countries, is, according to the 
information currently in our possession, at its maximum 
production capacity. Uranium and manganese are sold in deeply 
depressed markets that are severely affected by recession in our 
buyers' countries. 
  To a lesser extent, timber needs huge equipment investment 
at 
the both the forest and industrial transformation levels and 
ecological constraints have now been toughened since the Rio 
conference. It is therefore for reasons of solidarity that we 
were forced to fall in line with a high rate of devaluation, too 
high, perhaps, for the internal data of our economy. We expect 
this economy to be interpreted by businessmen as being credible 
and lasting enough in order not to embark on any speculation. 
[passage omitted] 
  As an immediate step, I have asked that relief measures be 
taken, as much as possible, to protect economic sectors where 
the prices of imported goods have increased as a result of the 
devaluation. New and courageous measures have therefore been 
taken to significantly reduce the customs duties applied to 
businesses. To alleviate the effects of the new parity, customs 
duties on imports will be as follows: 5 percent for essential 
commodities; 10 percent instead of 15 percent for capital goods; 
20 percent instead of 35 percent for intermediate goods; 30 
percent instead of 50 percent for consumer goods. With regard 
to this specific measure, it should be pointed out that the 
state is sacrificing a lot -- it is forgoing budget revenues 
amounting to about 45 billion CFA francs. It is doing this to 
relieve the most vulnerable consumers and to enable businesses 
to continue buying from outside and therefore to invest under 
the best conditions. [passage omitted] 
  An interministerial committee has been set up to monitor and 
complete the relief measures. The ministries concerned have 
accordingly started extensive consultations with businessmen to 
jointly assess the trend of prices, profit margins, and 
salaries. With respect to salaries, I would like to state here 
that we are faced with certain constraints from the IMF, and our 
negotiations with them are continuing. It will also be 
necessary to fix general authorized profit margins for traders. 
Such margins must incorporate the new parity into the cost 
price of goods. A decree was drafted and signed to this effect 
on 31 January. A set of relief measures should be completed 
very soon, that is, at the end of the ongoing consultations. 
  Despite the added constraints resulting from the 
depreciation 
of our currency, I reiterate, on behalf of the government, that 
every effort will be made, as much as is possible, to reduce the 
indisputable constraints that the devaluation of the CFA franc 
will incur for our country. This situation is even more 
delicate to manage considering that the price of oil is now 
about $13 per barrel, which roughly takes us back to 1986 rates. 
Remember that $1 more or less on the price per barrel of oil 
results in a positive or negative variation of 50 billion CFA 
francs on our budget revenue. If the price per barrel -- which 
is now $13 -- goes up to $14, we earn an additional 50 billion 
CFA francs in revenue. And if the price goes down from $13 to 
$12, we lose 50 billion CFA francs on our revenue. We can 
therefore judge for ourselves the considerable impact the price 
of oil per barrel has on our public finances and hence, on our 
entire economy. [passage omitted] 
  The devaluation should indirectly -- if it is properly 
monitored -- lead us to remodel our production machinery by 
promoting activities that until now could not be undertaken. We 
can no longer and must no longer continue to be consumers of 
goods produced abroad. In the food sector, for example, a 
minimum self-sufficiency is necessary or indispensable, I would 
say. We and our neighbors finally need to seriously organize 
gradually but resolutely a true common economic zone that goes 
beyond our national borders. Instead of us all trying to 
manufacture the same goods at unavoidably high prices on limited 
markets, we should perhaps think of some kind of division of 
labor that is based on the primary natural resources of each 
country. It is also no longer possible to continue exporting 
mostly raw materials, especially in the timber sector. I hope 
timber sector operators are listening to me. Logging permits 
and other benefits in this sector must first be given to those 
who process or who wish to invest in the processing of timber. 
In this regard, the banking system, as well as tax, trading, 
and monetary policies, must be combined to promote 
industrialization--instead of being limited to the financing of 
relatively easy import-export operations. We also have assets 
in the services sector, but I would rather not go into details 
about this. In short, the state must do all it can to promote 
the development of the nation's resources, with the support of 
the Gabonese people. [passage omitted] 
  I am indeed convinced that the only way that we can overcome 
the numerous obstacles I have described to you and meet the 
economic challenges facing us at the dawn of the third 
millennium is hard work, resourcefulness, the education of our 
youth, and investments. I am sure that we will all assume our 
responsibilities, be courageous and patient, and make those 
necessary sacrifices which will give us a fresh impetus on the 
path to economic and social progress. It is to meet these 
challenges together that the nation trusts that it can count on 
the widest support of the patriots that you are. Thank you.

  [Text] Kinshasa, 3 Feb (AFP)--Etienne Tshisekedi, former 
Zairian prime minister dismissed by Marshal Mobutu in February 
1993, has said he remains the legal prime minister appointed by 
the Sovereign National Conference [CNS] and that he "will not be 
represented" at the High Council of the Republic-Transitional 
Parliament [HCR-PT]. 
  Mr. Tshisekedi, whose words were reported today by the 
weekly 
L'INTRUS, made this statement at the end of a meeting with the 
Belgian ambassador to Kinshasa, Jean Coene, who visited him 
yesterday. "I will not be represented anywhere. I am and will 
remain the prime minister," Mr. Tshisekedi said, adding that "if 
the HCR members are manipulated by Mobutu, they will find us in 
their way." 
  Following the agreements signed between the presidential 
group and the radical opposition after four months of 
negotiations, the HCR has merged with the PT to become the 
HCR-PT. It is now the duty of the HCR-PT to appoint the new 
prime minister charged with managing the transition. On this 
point, Mr. Tshisekedi said he considers the negotiations "as an 
amendment of the transitional constitution drawn up by the CNS

<F P=106> [News conference by (Joseph Singa Uju), leader of the Allied </F>
Forces group, with unidentified correspondents in Kinshasa on 2 
February--recorded] 
  [Text] Today, nobody, I repeat, nobody can clearly say that 
all the people support him. But we hope that that time will 
come soon. For three years now, we have been treading water. I 
think that everyone is fed up with the crisis, and it is time we 
end it. Maybe some people take pleasure in this crisis, just to 
keep a myth or an illusion alive. But for us, the Allied 
Forces, that is too much indeed. The Zairian people have become 
an object. A politician cannot try to reign over skeletons or 
dead bodies. We engage in politics to lead human beings who are 
alive. The Allied Forces are proud, really proud, and we showed 
it in front of the cameras. We are proud to have done what we 
did. When things return to normal, history will someday 
remember that a handful of men, who are not much talked about in 
this country and who did not have the ambition of obtaining the 
divine right of dominating others, freely and defying all 
dangers decided to write another page of this country's history. 
  The Allied Forces are not asking to be worshiped, because 
they are not God, but only poor mortals such as yourselves. 
They are only asking to be judged objectively and impartially. 
We are not asking the media to praise us. We did what we did 
to the best of our knowledge and belief, before God, the nation, 
and history. 
  The day will come when--as is often said--this joke will be 
over, and we will go to the polls to see who really leads a 
change-supporting camp and who does not. Leaders of a 
change-supporting camp are competent leaders who want progress 
-- they are good leaders. Those who want no change belong to a 
bad camp. In any case we, the Allied Forces, are aware that we 
have sincere friends who support us. They are not our slaves. 
They are our equals [words indistinct] political leaders not to 
be considered superior to the others, (?Because we are like the 
others). We are working in this spirit of truth, knowing that 
the people's confidence is not eternal. At a given time, the 
people will wake up and see whether their leaders are ruling 
(?as due) [words indistinct]. 
  For us, true change comes in various phases. There is a 
change of men, in leadership, in institutions, and in management 
systems. Today, we can change our leaders, as is done normally 
in a democratic country, through the election process. [passage 
in local dialect] nothing will change. This means that the 
Third Republic might be the same as the second one if the people 
choose incompetent leaders. If the people do not put in place 
institutions adapted to current requirements and if these 
leaders chosen by the people continue to manage the country, as 
was the case during the Second Republic, nothing will change.

  [Text] This Tuesday, 1 February 1994, the head of state, 
Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko signed a number of decrees, some 
related to public and mixed economy companies, one related to 
the Banque du Zaire and two others concerning the education 
sector. 
  Concerning the Banque du Zaire, the head of state has 
appointed a new governor and a new deputy governor. Through 
this action, and following the protective measures taken to curb 
the ill-considered outflow of important funds from the Banque du 
Zaire, the head of state sought to draw all the conclusions from 
the report issued by the board of the Banque du Zaire. It has 
been concluded from this report that serious presumptions of 
responsibility weigh heavily on the governor of the Banque du 
Zaire, concerning not only the failure of the monetary reform of 
28 September 1993 but also the mismanagement of the (?concurrent 
issuing of bank notes) that resulted from the aforementioned 
reform. 
  In promoting the former deputy governor, (Ndian Kabul) -- 
who 
was not involved in the failure of the aforementioned monetary 
reform -- to the rank of governor, the head of state has put his 
trust in a high-ranking civil servant of the institution who is 
called on to take measures likely to improve the dramatic 
situation of our central bank. The same could be said of the 
deputy governor who has been chosen among the high-ranking 
experienced men of our monetary institution. 
  Concerning public sector companies and one mixed economy 
company, the head of state has taken these measures to fill the 
vacancies that resulted from the measures of dismissal that have 
recently hit the former managers of PetroZaire, the national 
post and telecommunications board of Zaire and Zaire-SEP. 
  We note that concerning this matter, the head of state has 
appealed to competent managers who are experienced in their 
fields. In addition, the head of state has at the same time 
sought to resolve the problem of the legal statute of the Banque 
de Commerce Exterieure du Zaire [Foreign Trade Bank of Zaire] 
which has for a long time been operation in a state of confusion. 
  Finally, concerning the education sector, the president of 
the republic, Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko has also signed two 
decrees, one concerning the restructuring and the reorganization 
of the Zairean national commission to UNESCO and the other 
appointing the permanent secretary of this commission. 
  Here are the main points of these decrees, signed on 
Tuesday, 
1 February, 1994 by the president of the republic, Marshal 
Mobutu Sese Seko: 
  1. Decree number 94-007, appointing the governor and the 
deputy governor of the Banque du Zaire. Governor of the Bank of 
Zaire: M. (Ndyong Gabul); Vice-Governor of the Bank of Zaire, M. 
Matomina Kyala. 
  2. Decree number 94-008, appointing public managers in 
public 
and mixed economy companies: 

  -  BZCE [Zairean Bank of External Trade] Administrative 
President Delegate: Gbendo Ndewa Tete 
  -  Zaire-CEP, Deputy Director General: M. Mbombo Engondo, 
  -  Banque de Credit Agricole, Director General: (Monoto Mualo 
Panza); Deputy Director General of the Banque de Credit 
Agricole: (Monga Wangalaba) 
  -  NPTZ, Director General: (Bayumbo Mbokolya bwe); Deputy 
Director 
General (Lungele Mastajabu) 
  -  OZAC: Office Zairois de Controle: Deputy Director General 
(Ndaye Nkondo Mukekelai) 
  -  PetroZaire: Director General: (Ndondi Mbungu Kiyaka); Deputy 
Director General: (Mbui Bati Kukuta). 

    3. Decree number 94-010, appointing the permanent secretary 
of the Zairean National Commission for UNESCO: this is (Ikete 
Ebale Belotsi) [passage omitted]

that regional issues should be solved within a regional 
framework.

bilateral relations and questions of mutual interest were

  [Text] Nairobi, 3 Feb (KNA/PANA) -- Kenya's inflation rate 
slowed down from 101.1 percent in June 1993 to 15 percent in 
December the same year, Finance Minister Musalia Mudavadi said 
Wednesday [3 February]. In a speech during a two-day workshop 
on "export finance policies and modalities," Mudavadi said 
further reduction of the inflationary pressure may be 
anticipated in coming months. "I targeted a rate of only 10 
percent in my budget speech by the end of the year and while 
this has not been achieved, we are already on track and progress 
to date has been substantial," he said. 
  Mudavadi told the bankers, insurers, manufacturers, and 
fresh 
produce exporters who attended the workshop that development of 
export finance and insurance sectors had to be set within the 
context of the financial management of the economy as a whole. 
The minister said the performance of financial markets directly 
affects the rest of the economy, adding that sweeping changes in 
the banking act, the central bank act and insurance act were 
being considered within the treasury. Mudavadi noted that a 
majority of Kenyan banks confined themselves to asset-based 
lending rather than cash flow lending to avoid high risks.

  [Text] Ulundi Feb 3 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said on Thursday [3 February] the 
reported agreement by the African National Congress [ANC] to a 
two-ballot system does not address the bottom line demands of 
his party, SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio 
news reports. 
  Mr Buthelezi said at Ulundi that he hoped the ANC and the 
government would also agree to the IFP's remaining two important 
demands. He said it would be no use having regional elections 
if regions had no exclusive powers. 
  Canadian Secretary of State for Africa and Latin America 
Mrs. 
Christine Stewart met Mr Buthelezi on Thursday to try to 
persuade the IFP to take part in the election. She said she 
hoped the ballot paper issue would make it easier for the IFP to 
participate.

  [Text] Durban Feb 3 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said on Thursday [3 February] his 
party's participation in the April election would depend on more 
than the African National Congress [ANC] agreeing to a 
two-ballot system. 
  In an address to Durban businessmen, Mr Buthelezi stressed 
constitutional issues surrounding regional powers were crucial 
for the IFP's participation in the poll. "Even if the 
government and the ANC/SA Communist Party alliance do relent on 
this issue of the double ballot, the double ballot by itself is 
quite meaningless if regions do not have the autonomy which 
cannot be interfered with by the constituent assembly," Mr 
Buthelezi said in a speech for delivery. 
  The ANC has reportedly agreed to separate votes for regional 
and national parliaments, a major stumbling block in protracted 
talks between the ANC, government and Freedom Alliance aimed at 
getting the alliance, including the IFP, to participate in the 
poll. 
  Mr Buthelezi had recently said this was one of the biggest 
reason for staying out of the election. But, the IFP leader 
said on Thursday regional powers outlined in the interim 
constitution were unacceptable. "The...constitution affords to 
the provinces less powers than under the present unitary 
dispensation.... No independent political expression is 
possible at the provincial level." 
  Mr Buthelezi said the constitution did not allow regional 
parliaments to collect their own taxes, and suggested this would 
enable the national parliament to manipulate the regions through 
their budgets. 
  He cited recent efforts by the Transitional Executive 
Council 
to replace the kwaZulu Police with the SA Police. 
  Mr Buthelezi rejected the argument that kwaZulu/Natal was 
too 
poor to go it alone in a federal dispensation. He said an 
equalisation fund, normal among federations around the world, 
would be used to give the region required money. 
  Mr Buthelezi further reiterated the need for a constitution 
recognising Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. "As the traditional 
prime minister to the king, there can therefore be no question 
of myself accepting a cabinet position in a constitutional 
set-up which excludes my king."

  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 3 SAPA -- There was good economic 
news coming for South Africa, Finance Minister Derek Keys told 
the National Party [NP] federal congress at the World Trade 
Centre near Johannesburg on Thursday [3 February]. He said he 
could not pre-empt any detailed announcement, but it sufficed to 
say it was very good news. "It is the type of situation every 
finance minister dreams of, when all the figures are running in 
the right direction," he said. 
  Mr Keys was one of a number of ministers and senior party 
members selected to address the congress on the party's new 
election manifesto. He said there were three basic differences 
between the NP and its main opponent, the African National 
Congress [ANC], on economic policy. 
  Firstly, the NP's policy was for everyone, and not seeking 
economic growth and advancement of any sector at the expense of 
another. 
  Secondly, the NP trusted all the economic players -- labour, 
the farmers, businessmen and entrepreneurs. "We are proud of 
them," he said. The NP did not want to take away their capital, 
monitor them or constantly watch to see they were not doing 
something wrong. 
  Thirdly, he said, the NP government consulted widely and 
timeously [as received] -- as with the National Economic Forum 
and other bodies -- before formulating policy or taking action. 
  "These three things represent transparency," he said.

  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 3 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress [ANC] confused its own international acceptability with 
that of its leader, Nelson Mandela, who was indeed 
internationally accepted as a martyr, Transvaal National Party 
[NP] leader Pik Botha said on Thursday [3 February]. He was 
given a standing ovation at the NP federal congress at Kempton 
Park's World Trade Centre for a sharp attack on the ANC while 
speaking in support of the NP's new election manifesto. 
  The ANC was not African or national or a congress, he said. 
The ANC was an embarrassment everywhere in Africa because it 
pursued policies which were no longer practiced anywhere on the 
continent. "They still call each other 'comrade', and African 
leaders ask me why can't the ANC get rid of the past. It claims 
to have international acceptability but, but by whom? They 
confuse their acceptability with that of Mr Mandela who is a 
martyr," he said. 
  "They are not African because there is not one country in 
Africa that propagates their policies. They are not national 
but a conglomeration of converse foreign ideologies. They are 
also not a congress but a conglomeration of confused people." 
  The ANC also could not refrain from personal insults against 
President F W de Klerk. In front of foreign governments and 
audiences where Mr de Klerk was regarded as a man of integrity, 
the ANC acknowledged this. But the moment the ANC addressed an 
audience that "lives in the past with a racist orientation", Mr 
de Klerk was reviled as a criminal and racist terrorist. "There 
was only one man who liberated South Africa -- not as a sign of 
weakness -- and that is why he got the Nobel Peace Prize," Mr 
Botha said. 
  Mr Botha received a standing ovation with some black women 
delegates ululating and whistling.

  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 3 SAPA--Four National Party [NP] 
candidates for premiership have been elected unopposed in their 
regions. It was announced at the party's federal congress on 
Thursday that Mr Hernus Kriel, Dr Kraai van Niekerk and Dr 
Tertius Delport, would be candidate premiers for the Western 
Cape, Northern Cape and Eastern Cape regions respectively, and 
Mr George Bartlett for Natal/kwaZulu. 
  State President and leader of the NP F W de Klerk said the 
federal council of the party had decided to allow four regional 
preferences and each of the provinces could choose the 
procedures they would allow for nomination of candidates for 
premiership in the various regions. During discussions in the 
federal council, some regions declared they would prefer to 
appoint a candidate for premier from the elected members after 
the election.

<F P=106> [By Pierre Claassen, political correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Kempton Park Feb 3 SAPA--The National Party's [NP] 
inspirational federal congress had proved that true 
reconciliation had been achieved within the party, NP leader F W 
de Klerk said in Kempton Park on Thursday [3 February]. 
  Closing one of the most extraordinary congresses of the 
party's 81-year history, he said the NP had demonstrated it was 
the only party which could claim to be truly national, 
representing and speaking on behalf of all the country's people. 
  He was personally inspired, not by the huge number of 
delegates or the spontaneous way in which it had reflected the 
new make up of the party, but by its spirit of warmth, 
naturalness and courage. "I am inspired by a meeting of spirits 
and messages that came from the heart," he said. 
  However, he had a word of caution for the congress. It was 
easy to get pumped up with enthusiasm and courage at such a 
gathering, "but there are many Nationalists out there who feel 
lonely". "I saw them on the (electioneering) road show, I stood 
next to them when they had the guts to stand up and were 
surrounded by hundreds toyi-toying [protest dancing] against 
them." 
  For each Nat [NP member] under threat, there were thousands 
who were worried and who did not stand up on rooftops because it 
was dangerous. Mr de Klerk said the NP should create a massive 
wave to break across the country and take these people with it 
and give them courage. 
  Amazing scenes had preceded Mr de Klerk's closing address 
when candidates of the four provinces had been introduced. 
Black languages, spontaneous singing, ululating, whistling and 
"viva's" had underscored the wide ethnic mix which now 
represented the former party of apartheid. 
  After the closing, a gallery of what organisers called "our 
more colourful candidates" met the media. 
  One of two former ANC [African National Congress] Umkhonto 
we 
Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing] members 
present, Mr Joshua Khumalo, said he had not joined the NP. 
"Nobody joins his family, I just comes home." 
  Former Springbok rugby captain Naas Botha said he was as 
surprised as anyone to have been nominated. "But then I thought 
about what is going to happen for the next 35 years...and 
standing on the sidelines is easy."

[African National Congress] for the deterioration of community 
conditions in the townships. Mr. de Klerk said in Johannesburg 
that organizations with strong ties with the ANC [African

prevented houses and schools being built. He said the ANC had 
achieved international standing only because it fought against

  [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] says those who 
had hoped to see a new National Party [NP] grappling with the 
realities of the country will have been bitterly disappointed by 
the party's election manifesto. The manifesto was announced 
earlier at the NP federal congress at Kempton Park. 
  In a statement in Johannesburg the ANC says that instead of 
presenting concrete proposals, NP leaders have attempted to 
undermine the ANC. It said the NP remained wedded to policies 
that would leave 75 percent of the population living in poverty 
and squalor.

  [Text] Sasolburg February 4 SAPA -- ANC [African National 
Congress] President Nelson Mandela kicked off his election swing 
through the Orange Free State [OFS] with a breakfast at the 
Sasol [South African Coal, Oil, and Gas Corporation] Club where 
he addressed about 150 people. 
  Mr Mandela arrived at the club and greeted staff before 
telling his predominantly white audience his welcome at the club 
was a sign of the times -- especially in light of the 
relationship between the petrol from oil giant and the ANC's 
armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation] (which has 
attacked its installations in the past). 
  Asked to comment on this week's National Party federal 
congress, the ANC leader said: "What is there to say about a 
party on its way out? The National Party is still a racist 
party." He requested business people to trust the ANC as its 
policy mirrored the basic aspirations of all South Africans. 
  He added the ANC was not out to run a campaign of revenge 
against the people who had jailed party leaders, but rather 
wanted all South Africans to work together. The country's 
economy had become stangnant due to years of apartheid and it 
was up to the ANC and the people of South Africa to stimulate 
growth. 
  "We would like all of you, especially white businessmen, to 
help achieve this. We all have a common loyalty to South Africa 
and we all want to live in peace." 
  Turning to the spate of sabotage attacks on the offices and 
homes of ANC aligned people and organisations in the [Orange] 
Free State, Mr Mandela told his audience: "They (ANC homes and 
offices) are being bombed by people who are demanding to cling 
to apartheid...It is our people being killed by the right 
wing...By security organisations and by other black groups...But 
the whites in this country are totally silent. When there is 
violence it is sparked off by the right wing and is tolerated by 
the De Klerk government. Without peace we are not going to get 
investment from abroad." 
  Mr Mandela added money was being taken out of the country 
because of the violence. If a right wing inspired civil war 
broke out, it was not only blacks who would be killed. Whites 
were destroying the future of their children by not acting 
stongly enough on the violence sweeping the country.

  [Text] Sasolburg Feb 4 SAPA--The African National Congress 
[ANC] would provide free compulsory education and medical 
services, ANC President Nelson Mandela told about 4,000 
enthusiastic supporters at Zamdela near Sasolburg on Friday [4 
February]. 
  He was enthusiastically received when he told the crowd that 
already jobs were being created by the lifting of sanctions and 
by progress made in South Africa. The National Party [NP] 
federal congress this week had been paralysed by a spirit of 
gloom as the party leadership had no vision. "They say they 
removed apartheid, how selfish. It is you people here and your 
leaders who went to jail that forced the removal of apartheid. 
The people brought an end to apartheid." 
  Mr Mandela said NP was paralysed and terrified by the 
rightwing. "The rightwing started a radio station illegally, 
but instead of closing them down, they went to the courts and 
when they were issued a court order they went and were 
frightened when the rightwing said they could not enter this 
radio station." 
  He said President F. W. de Klerk was frightened and had no 
fighting spirit. The ANC vision of moving the country forward 
had been lauded by foreign heads of state, business people and 
executives of international lending organisations. "We have 
done all this, what has been done by the National Party?" 
  Mr Mandela said the Conservative Party [CP] was now in the 
same situation as the National Party was in a few years ago. 
"The ANC was able to put the NP's fears about ANC to rest, and 
we could do the same for the CP and the Freedom Alliance," Mr 
Mandela said to loud applause. 
  "The people are shunning the NP like lepers. They are still 
a racist party, still clinging to racism in some way or another, 
that is why their list of election candidates is predominantly 
white." 
  White NP members wanted to hold on to the party leadership, 
this was the reason why there were so few people of colour on 
the NP's list. Mr Mandela also called for the preservation of 
Afrikaans. The local branch of the ANC presented Mr Mandela 
with a rocking chair. 
  Mr Mandela left Sasolburg for Bothaville in the heart of the 
wealthy maize triangle.

  [Text] ANC [African National Congress] supporters have 
slammed the nomination of former House of Delegates Chairman 
J.N. Reddy to the ANC's list of candidates to the National 
Assembly. A mass meeting in Durban, called by the Natal Indian 
Congress to explain the reasons behind the nomination, failed to 
convince the ANC supporters. They demanded that Dr. Reddy and 
former Natal MEC [Member Executive Committee], D.S. Rajah, be 
removed from the list on the grounds that they had been part of 
an oppressive system that had played no role in making life 
better for the masses. Dr. Reddy will make an announcement on 
his nomination today.

<F P=106> [Report by Greta Steyn] </F>
  [Text] Bankers yesterday sent a strong signal of protest to 
the ANC [African National Congress] over its reconstruction and 
development programme's proposals to restructure the banking 
sector. 
  At a seminar on banking in Johannesburg yesterday, Standard 
Bank group economist Nico Czypionka said the proposals had "made 
my hair stand on end" and called on fellow bankers to contact 
the ANC to express concern. Cyzpionka was referring to 
suggestions that banks be required to lend a rising share of 
their assets to small, black-owned enterprises and be forced to 
provide reasons for turning down loan applications. 
  He said the ANC should be told that the NP [National Party] 
government had tried the route of controls over banks, with 
"messy" results for the economy. "To be blunt, the proposals 
are based on a fundamental misunderstanding of how the financial 
sector works." The programme was "a shopping list that, if added 
up, would blow the country's financial resources out of the 
water." 
  To the extent that it was financially and physical feasible, 
banks would push hard to address under development problems and 
play a part in dealing with apartheid legacies. They had to do 
this without deviating from the principles of sound business 
practice, he said. At this time of change, when new economic and 
other policies were being sought, banks had to make their voices 
heard. "I am not sure that we as bankers are doing this 
adequately and effectively. I getthe strong feeling that this 
country's banks have sold themselves short -- we are doing far 
more than we are being given credit for." 
  Banks had a vested interest in the long-term prosperity of 
the country, and had taken active measures to support this with 
concrete actions. He cited the growing momentum of community 
banking operations within a number of banks, the Community 
Banking Project, the negotiations between the Association of 
Mortgage Lenders and civic organisations, and involvement in the 
National Housing Forum. 
  Council of Southern African banks CE [chief executive] Piet 
Liebenberg said the industry was in the process of formulating a 
response to the ANC's policy statement. "The ANC's statement 
was issued without consultation. We will not be able to change 
much, if anything, in the reconstruction and development 
programme. But we intend to lobby, inform and debate the 
issues. We are pulling out all the stops," he said. He did 
not, however, believe nationalisation was a real threat to the 
industry. 
  Community Banking Project CE Archie Hurst said the most 
optimistic projections indicated that by the year 2000, the 
bank's total advances would not exceed R[rand]3bn[billion]. He 
urged commercial banks to keep exploring ways of being active at 
the bottom end of the market, while government involvement was 
also important. "It is our hope that through its efforts, the 
Community Bank will pave the way for commercial banks to become 
involved in this market."

  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 3 SAPA -- The National Education, 
Health and Allied Workers Union [NEHAWU] had lost control of its 
members and was acting in an irresponsible and totally 
unacceptable manner with regard to the current hospital strikes, 
Health Minister Dr. Rina Venter said on Thursday [3 February]. 
"The government is extremely concerned about the situation," 
she told SAPA at the National Party federal congress in Kempton 
Park. 
  She said there had been reports of union members urinating 
on 
patients, emptying dustbins in hospitals, attacks on 
administrative staff and the damaging of staff cars. "This is 
totally unacceptable and the public should take notice that the 
union has lost control of its members. The African National 
Congress says striking is an essential weapon for negotiation. 
It says hospitals cannot be categorised as emergency services 
and that it wants to protect patients". 
  She said it was a fact neither ANC election candidate and 
NEHAWU Secretary-General Philip Dexter, nor union members cared 
about the welfare of the patients.

<F P=106> [Report by Jovial Rantao, labor correspondent] </F>
  [Text] The Congress of South African Trade Unions [COSATU], 
which has supported the ANC [African National Congress] since 
its inception, will become more influential in a future 
government, says labour expert Duncan Innes. Writing in his 
Innes Labour Brief, Innes argues that COSATU would have 20 of 
its leaders occupying seats in parliament and at least one, Jay 
Naidoo, in a key ministerial post. 
  "For this reason alone, labour relations will not be the 
same 
after elections as they were before. From being an 
anti-establishment force under apartheid, COSATU is about to 
become part of the new establishment," he writes. Being part of 
the establishment can be a mixed blessing for a radical 
organisation such as COSATU. 
  "On one hand, it does confer certain clear advantages on the 
union movement, but it also brings with it responsibilities 
which might not be so palatable to the union's constituency," 
Innes says. 
  Among the key advantages COSATU would derive from being part 
of the establishment is that instead of having to fight from a 
largely defensive position in the policy arena, it would now be 
in a position to make policy proposals for the country. He says 
the ANC's Reconstruction and Development Programme -- a crucial 
part of its development strategy -- was co-ordinated by Jay 
Naidoo. Alex Erwin of the National Union of Metalworkers of 
South Africa played a major role in the drafting of the 
programme. 
  "The unions are no longer on the outside; they're on the 
inside of state policy formulation," Innes observes. 
  Going hand in hand with the advantages will be 
disadvantages. 
  "The ANC will be inheriting a country that has been ravaged 
by a lengthy and damaging recession, isolated from world trends, 
torn apart by political strife and bedevilled by social disorder 
and crime. Governing such a country is no easy task, especially 
people who have no experience of government. Consequently, the 
ANC government will find itself under massive pressures once it 
assumes power, and it will look to its allies for support," 
Innes says. 
  Other difficulties would be that a person such as Jay Naidoo 
-- "the Minister of Reconstruction" -- would be asked by the 
Cabinet to secure union support for policies designed to keep 
the public sector wage bill under control. In caucus meetings, 
the COSATU MPs would be asked to use their influence to curb 
militant strike action among workers in the interests of 
promoting stability and order so as to attract foreign and local 
investment, Innes says.

  [Text] Pietermaritzburg Feb 3 SAPA -- An Inkatha Freedom 
Party [IFP] man was shot dead and three IFP members wounded on 
Wednesday night as a hail of at least 12 bullets raked their 
bakkie [pick-up truck] in Bruntville, Mooi River. The IFP 
Information Centre's Ed Tillett said Thursday the unprovoked 
attack came after six months of relative calm in the area. He 
feared it could mark a resumption of "African National 
Congress-spearheaded violence" and that Bruntville township 
would once again be plunged into violence. 
  Police confirmed the shooting and believed AK-47 rifles were 
used. Captain Henry Budhram said the men were on their way from 
a Mooitex factory at about 10.40pm when bullets rained into the 
vehicle. 
  Shot dead was Bethuel Phungula, 30, while William Dlamini, 
30, was hit by four bullets, in the chest, knee, forearm and 
thorax. 
  Alfred Dludla, 45, was hit in a lower leg and Jotham Lamula, 
35, was struck in an upper arm and left eye. The wounded men are 
in estcourt hospital. 
  No arrests have been made.

  [Text] Another explosion has rocked the Western Transvaal, 
this time on a farm belonging to a white member of the ANC 
[African National Congress], Mr. Jan Serfontein. An explosive 
device ripped a hole in the wall on Mr. Serfontein's farm, 
Boskop, near Potchefstroom. Explosions occur almost daily in 
the area and so far the police have not made a breakthrough. 
The police have not yet revealed the type of explosives 
involved. 
  The ANC, COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions] and 
other trade unions which have suffered damage because of the 
explosions believe commercial explosives are being used. COSATU 
said earlier that the police should do more to protect its 
offices and catch the extremists. COSATU is to ask the 
Transitional Executive Council Subcouncil on Law and Order to 
give urgent attention to the matter.

  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 4 SAPA -- Sasol [South African 
Coal, Oil, and Gas Corporation] and Hyundai of Korea said on 
Friday [4 February] they had recently signed a contract for the 
manufacture and erection of the reactor module and steam drum of 
the R[rand]123-million Sasol advanced synthol (SAS) reactor 
project. 
  Babcock Construction contractors will assist Hyundai with 
on-site construction. At the signing Hannes Botha, managing 
director of Sasol synthetic fuels, said the installation of this 
reactor was a step toward producing synthetic oil more cost 
effectively than at present. "The new technology used in the 
SAS reactor is more energy efficient, requires lower capital 
investment and needs less maintenance than the proven synthol 
technology. Sasol is always looking for ways to improve its cost 
competitiveness and it is foreseen that this new addition will 
contribute toward this purpose," Mr Botha said. 
  Mr N. K. Kim, regional director of Hyuandai in South Africa, 
said his company accepted the challenge for the manufacture of 
the SAS reactor, which uses the latest technology for the 
production of oil from gas. The reactor will weigh 840 [metric] 
tons and is too large to be transported as a unit from Korea to 
Sasol Two. Parts of the reactor, some of them weighing 300 
[metric] tons, will be shipped to Richards Bay and transported 
by road from there to Secunda. Assembly will take place at the 
construction site. Sophisticated welding techniques will be used 
for the closing seams under difficult site conditions. 
  A set of complex steam coils weighing 240 [metric] tons will 
be installed inside the reactor. The coils will be shipped from 
Korea in sections and will be assembled on site. When 
construction is complete a hydro test will be done requiring 
1.7-million litres of water. 
  The commissioning of the plant is planned in September 1995 
and will increase the gas utilisation at the Secunda complex. 
The reactor will have a capacity greater than each of the 
existing circulating fluid bed reactors and requires much less 
capital to erect. 
  Sastech was appointed as managing contractor after 
completion 
of a research and development project to establish an 
alternative reactor technology. In 1991 the team of Sastech 
scientists and process engineers was awarded the Bille Neale-May 
gold medal by the South African Institute of Chemical Engineers 
as well as the national award of the Associated Scientific and 
Technical Societies of South Africa for developing, designing 
and commissioning the prototype of the new reactor. 
  The contract for the detail engineering and design was 
awarded to Raytheon engineers and constructors of Boston, USA.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Swing Vote To Ensure Election Democracy -- Referring to the 
findings of a Market and Media Research poll commissioned by THE 
STAR, Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 4 February in a 
page-10 editorial welcomes the fact that "a quarter of the 
voters are undecided." This means the outcome of the election 
"is not pre- determined, that the campaign, the election issues 
and the arguments and counter-arguments are more than the ritual 
din of electioneering." The undecided voters will ensure "there 
will be an element of unpredictability and excitement." THE 
STAR believes that "democracy depends on the swing vote." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Economic Policy Taking Shape -- "While the constitutional 
negotiations stumble on, the policy negotiations are having far 
more success," remarks a page-6 editorial in Johannesburg 
BUSINESS DAY in English on 4 February. The "public spats" about 
the ANC attitudes to mines and banks are but the latest examples 
of this process, "which is proving hugely beneficial and is the 
best reason we have to hope for economic prosperity." "The ANC 
[African National Congress], like the NP [National Party], is 
considering new ways of achieving an unchanged goal. The NP 
switched from domination to negotiation to secure white 
survival, and Afrikaner survival in particular. The ANC wants 
to redress apartheid's ills, ending the economic focus on white 
businesses and individuals spreading economic empowerment and 
tangible benefits to blacks while using state resources to 
attack poverty, disease, illiteracy, homelessness and 
unemployment." The country has "come a long way since 1990," 
and its politics "may be in a mess but, draft by draft and 
argument by argument, an acceptable economic policy is taking 
shape." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  ANC Can Afford Double-Ballot Elections -- "As the party that 
is likely to get most of the support in the coming elections, 
the ANC can be magnanimous and accept some of the demands made 
by the Freedom Alliance," declares Johannesburg SOWETAN in 
English on 4 February in a page-10 editorial. This would "call 
the bluff of those in the alliance who refuse to go into the 
elections as they know they will be voted out. Apart from 
anything else double-ballot elections which will have 
credibility might even expose those homeland leaders who have no 
support in their own areas." 
  Black Economic Empowerment -- A second editorial on the same 
page welcomes the pending takeover of African Life by a 
coalition of black business people and community organizations. 
It is "a great step towards black economic empowerment." 
<H6>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H6>
  Poll Predictions Fit NP, DP Agenda -- "Beware of the opinion 
polls," cautions a page-14 editorial in Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL 
&amp; GUARDIAN in English for 4-10 February. "Predictions of an 
ANC 
landslide in April have the effect of lulling ANC activists and 
supporters into complacency and promoting the view among 
doubters that they should vote for a strong opposition. The 
poll that predicts an ANC landslide fits a National or 
Democratic Party agenda. The ANC's own polls give it only a 
little more than 50 percent. That's a more realistic figure, 
all things considered."

  [Text] The chief of staff of the Angolan Armed Forces, 
General Joao de Matos, has announced preparations for 
large-scale military operations against the UNITA [National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola] movement. Gen. 
Matos said government soldiers were becoming impatient over 
delays in the Angolan peace negotiations in the Zambian capital 
of Lusaka. He said it was necessary to put an end to the 
tension being experienced in various parts of Angola as a result 
of the civil war. Gen. Matos said earlier that the recent 
agreements between UNITA and Angolan Government peace 
delegations in Lusaka were a mere propaganda exercise and that 
no significant progress had been achieved.

  [Text] The Lusaka talks are already covering national 
reconciliation. Although Chief Beye is away from Lusaka, the 
negotiators today presented their proposals. The mediator and 
the troika of observers today dealt with basic issues regarding 
the standpoint of the two sides on national reconciliation. The 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] was 
late in submitting its proposal, thus postponing the mediator's 
final draft. The draft was scheduled to be presented this 
morning. 
  In time the government added new elements to its proposal. 
This pleased the troika, and local analysts regard this as 
proof that there is a will to tackle the issue at once. The 
government's pleasant mood is due partly to Chief Beye's remarks 
on national sovereignty. 
  As always, UNITA wants to deal with each point of the agenda 
in order to gain time. The zigzag began when UNITA was late in 
submitting its proposal. The situation worsened in view of the 
need to redraft it. 
  Sources that asked not to be named say UNITA's document 
contains more thorns than roses. In addition to the three key 
ministries, UNITA has demanded a more equitable redistribution 
of provincial governments, including one of the country's main 
commercial ports. The news media and UNITA's members being held 
in custody in Luanda are two other specific issues raised by the 
organization.

  [Text] While peace is being negotiated in Lusaka, Zambia, 
Eduardo dos Santos' men continue to decimate innocent civilians 
in the Huila and Benguela Provinces. According to correspondent 
Silva Aleluia, terrible crimes are being committed by the 
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party 
[MPLA-PT], particularly in the Chongoroi and Caimbambo 
Districts. The People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of 
Angola [FAPLA] have been carying out acts of murder, violating 
[words indistinct], and stealing people's goods. At least 223 
people have been massacred in these areas since December last 
year. Silva Aleluia learned this from Colonel Catu, from the 
UNITA Armed Forces Command in the Southeastern Region.

<F P=106> [Report on statement by Mozambican President Joaquim </F>
Chissano at Heroes Square in Maputo on 3 February--passages 
within quotation marks recorded] 
  [Text] Speaking at Heroes Square in Maputo today to mark 
Heroes' Day, the president of the Republic, Joaquim Chissano, 
expressed his belief that the problems currently preventing the 
swift confinement of government troops can easily be resolved 
because they are technical, rather than political, problems. 
  [Chissano] "That is a question that I have been asked 
constantly, even before I went abroad last week. My answer has 
always been that I believe that existing problems are of a 
technical, rather than political, nature, so they should be easy 
to settle and troop confinement should be over early enough for 
us to hold elections by October, as scheduled." 
  Asked whether government troop confinement delays were not 
caused by alleged disorganization, the Mozambican head of state 
replied: 
  [Chissano] "No, that is no true, because troop confinement 
does take place in good time when the right means are available 
and the orders are given. We have not yet had any problem 
caused by internal disorganization." 
  One journalist asked President Chissano to comment on the 
Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] leader's remark that 
Renamo figures, such as first Renamo President Andre 
Matsangaissa, also be remembered on Heroes' Day on 3 February. 
  [Chissano] "Well, our country (?has to define) [words 
indistinct] heroes must be recognized at the national level as 
Mozambican heroes. Those whose names we mention are the more 
representative, but that does not mean they include all 
Mozambican heroes. Now, if Andre Matsangaissa had the makings 
of a hero or not, that is for the Mozambican people to decide."

  [Text] The Mozambique Democratic Party, Pademo, has asked 
Afonso Dhlakama, the Mozambique National Resistance, Renamo, 
leader to urgently remind President Joaquim Chissano of the case 
of General Domingos Fondo's alleged involvement in the smuggling 
of weapons to South Africa. 
  A note received at the Radio Mozambique news desk says that 
Pademo also demands that the Renamo leader produce evidence 
demonstrating Gen. Domingos Fondo's culpability. Pademo 
believes that there must be no liars among the leaders of the 
opposition, so it advises Afonso Dhlakama to present 
incriminating evidence against Gen. Fondo. 
  The Pademo note also says that institutions such as the 
Attorney General's Office and the Criminal Investigation Police 
are working in fear and without the government's backing, 
thereby preventing proper investigation into cases such as Gen. 
Domingo Fondo's.

aiming to hinder his possible visit to the United States by 
issuing its annual report on the situation of human rights in 
Mozambique. Reacting to the report, Dhlakama described it as 
artificial and said it comes at a time when the Renamo president 
is preparing to visit Washington. Afonso Dhlakama said that the 
U.S. State Department report is meant for the U.S. public not to 
consider the Renamo leader as a politician. The report 
denounces serious human rights violations in areas controlled by 
Renamo, namely, the torture, abduction, and killing of people.

<F P=106> [Report for Gwen Lister] </F>
  [Text] Deputy Justice minister, Vekuii Rukoro, is out of 
the Cabinet. Rukoro is reported to have received a letter which 
instructed him not to return to cabinet meetings and to return 
all cabinet documents in his possession. The letter was signed 
by Peingondjabi Shipoh. 
  It is further reported that the reason given for his ousting 
is that he was no longer a leader of a political party. It was 
apparently by virtue of his former position as leader of SWANU 
[South-West Africa National Union] that he held a cabinet post. 
  However, his ousting comes rather belatedly since Rukoro 
resigned as SWANU leader in September last year. However, 
sources indicate that Rukoro may have fallen out of favour for 
reportedly raising criticism in Cabinet on Tuesday [25 January] 
about the lack of Government action in the controversial case of 
Justice Minister Ngarikutuke Tjiriange and Home Affairs deputy 
minister Nangolo Ithete, whose ostrich business has been 
implicated in alleged illegal ostrich dealing. Tjiriange is 
Rukoro's direct superior, and Rukoro was apparently told to 
`drop the subject.' 
  The letter to Rukoro from cabinet ordered him not to attend 
future meetings and to return all documentation, which he is 
reported to have done already. At the time of going to press 
last night, repeated efforts to contact the deputy minister for 
comment, were unsuccessful. At this stage it is not known 
whether Rukoro's deputy minister post is in jeopardy as well.

  [Text] Government will this year introduce and implement 
land reform legislation. It will also begin the spade work for 
the Presidential and National Assembly elections. 
  This was announced by President Sam Nujoma at a State House 
news conference on Wednesday. Many Namibians have complained 
about the availability of land and the disproportionate 
distribution of available arable land. A Land Conference was 
held in Windhoek in 1991, to find solutions to the land hunger. 
  The President vowed to pursue closer cooperation in conflict 
resolution to ensure stability for the common interests of the 
region. "Although our country enjoys relative peace and 
stability, we cannot be indifferent to the sufferings of 
others," President Nujoma told the press conference. 
  Nujoma reviewed development progress in the past year and 
said the government would continue to consolidate and strengthen 
the foundations of political, economic and social development. 
He declared that education would take priority in his 
government until the day he died. 
  "We have now embarked upon an irreversible path towards 
national building, a step that has led to sound investment 
opportunity and socio-economic upliftment of our people." 
President Nujoma highlighted successes in road infrastructural 
development, oil and gas exploration, fisheries and regional 
cooperation. 
  He welcomed the reintegration of Walvis Bay, stating that 
the 
port town would become a major centre for regional cooperation 
and would give great impetus to the growth of the Namibian 
economy. At independence, the government initiated the 
formidable task of turning Namibia's transport network towards a 
much more favourable east-west direction. 
  Five major road projects have been implemented and some of 
the new links are to be completed within the next three years. 
  On petroleum exploration and production, remarkable progress 
has also been achieved. Realising that the petroleum industry 
is a hazardous one, the government has established an emergency 
plan. It is developing oil and gas regulations regarding 
health, safety and the protection of the environment, during 
exploration and production activities. Pre-feasibility studies 
for Epupa hydro-electric scheme have been completed and the 
feasibility study phase is to commence soon. 
  President Nujoma expressed satisfaction with the growth of 
the fishing industry, which he described as the second largest 
industrial employer. The President noted that industrialists 
had made substantial foreign exchange earnings the past year and 
there would be no deterioration in the country's balance of

  [Text] The strike by over 350 unionized workers at 
Kalulushi Municipal Council entered its second day today, with 
Mayor Moses Mumba vowing the council will not succumb to 
workers' demands. Speaking to ZNBC [Zambia National Broadcasting 
Corporation] in Kalulushi today, Mr. Mumba said it was 
unacceptable for the workers to expect the council to award them 
1,000 kwacha transport allowance when their homes are less than 
a kilometer from their work place. Mr. Mumba said the council 
has already awarded the workers the 5 percent allowance, an 
indication of the council's commitment to the welfare of 
workers. Meanwhile, garbage is pilling up in the town as 
workers continue with the strike.

  [Text] Mali has been without a prime minister since 
yesterday following the resignation of Abdoulaye Sekou Sow. His 
resignation seems to be the result of a series of disagreements 
with elements of the radical wing of the ruling Alliance for 
Democracy in Mali [ADEMA]. Djibril Mboj has the details: 
  [Begin Mboj recording] At the beginning of the week, a local 
newspaper was already wondering whether Abdoulaye Sekou Sow had 
run out breath. On 12 April 1993, 62-year-old Sekou Sow, who 
has a raucous voice and a nonchalant gait, was entrusted with 
the weighty task of getting the country out of the crisis -- the 
persistent economic crisis -- and more especially the school 
crisis, which has been almost a permanent fixture in Mali for 
more than three years and which led to the resignation of the 
first government of the Third Republic. He very quickly 
distinguished himself as a man of dialogue who favors consensus. 
He was able to contain certain excesses and even found 
compromise solutions. Unfortunately, the demands by 
schoolchildren and workers continued to be more pressing, 
especially after the devaluation of the CFA franc. 
  Furthermore, Abdoulaye Sekou Sow is reported to have felt 
abandoned by his own supporters because the support he expected 
to get from the majority ADEMA party was not forthcoming. Added 
to this was the 48-hour strike notice by schoolchildren, who set 
up roadblocks and burned car tires. All these issues 
exasperated the affable sexagenarian, who showed courage, 
abnegation, and the desire to do a good job during the 10 months 
he spent as head of the government. If his resignation is 
accepted by the head of state, there will be a cabinet 
reshuffle, the fourth since Alpha Oumar Konare became president 
of Mali. [end recording]

  [Text] We might be able today to learn more concerning the 
resignation of the prime minister, Abdoulaye Sekou Sow. This 
resignation, which occurred yesterday, has not yet been 
officially confirmed. However, the national daily L'ESSOR said 
in today's issue that Mr. Sow did not participate in yesterday's 
regular cabinet meeting. Oumar Toure has the details: 
  [Toure] Prime Minister Abdoulaye Sekou Sow resigned 
yesterday. This report has not yet been confirmed by the 
presidency, but, according to sources close to the prime 
minister's office, the outgoing head of government was said to 
be categorical on his decision. This resignation, according to 
the same sources, reportedly followed a crisis of confidence 
between the resigning prime minister and the majority party, on 
one hand, and the prime minister and some political parties 
represented within the government, on the other. 
  This resignation comes at a time when Mali is trying to come 
to equitable and appropriate solutions to the situation 
generated by the devaluation of the CFA franc and also at a time 
when high school and university students are demonstrating 
against the criteria for the awarding of scholarships. 
Abdoulaye Sekou Sow entered the first government of the Third 
Republic as defense minister. He was appointed prime minister 
on 12 April 1993, following the resignation of Younoussi Toure's 
cabinet. He was later reappointed on 7 November 1993 to head 
the broad-based democratic cabinet. According to reliable 
sources, talks are under way at the political level to designate 
the new prime minister.

  [Text] Lagos, 3 Feb (AFP)--Two former Nigerian presidents 
have called for General Sani Abacha's military regime to step 
down in favor of a civilian government, local newspapers said 
Thursday [3 February]. Generals Olusegun Obasanjo and Mohammadu 
Buhari charged Abacha with being the "biggest disciple, 
supporter, and principle beneficiary" of the "corrupt" former 
regime of General Ibrahim Babangida. By their silence, 
Nigerians were "accomplices" in the new military regime, the 
former heads of state added in an address Wednesday in the 
northern town of Kaduna. 
  Government plans for a constitutional conference in the 
first 
half of the year were a "dangerous diversion," General Obasanjo 
said. Only a national conference, in which all elected 
representatives took part, would set Nigeria on a secure course 
for the future, he added. 
  Obasanjo, president from 1976 to 1979, was one of the first 
military leaders in Africa to hand over power to a 
democratically elected head of state, President Shehu Shagari. 
In 1983, Shagari's regime, discredited by a series of political 
and economic scandals, was ousted by Buhari. 
  President Abacha took power in August last year when he 
succeeded a short-lived civilian government which in turn had 
taken office after the eight-year regime of General Babangida. 
Babangida annulled the outcome of a long-awaited presidential 
poll last June which threatened to bring Moslem millionaire 
Moshood Abiola to power.

<F P=106> [From the press review section of the "Focus on Africa" </F>
program] 
  [Text] We start the day with a story that has been on the 
front pages of several Nigerian papers. Here is the headline of 
GUARDIAN: Obasanjo and Buhari List Leadership Ills. Yes, both 
former military rulers--one who gave power up to a democratic 
government and one who took power back again--have condemned the 
new regime of Sani Abacha. 
  The GUARDIAN reports thus: General Buhari suggested the 
removal of all those responsible for the economic and political 
malaise from leadership positions, and Gen. Obasanjo advocated a 
nonmilitary national government to tackle Nigeria's political, 
economic, and social ills. But there isn't just the military 
who get the blame. Gen. Obasanjo accused Nigerians of being 
accomplices by their silence, saying that if only six 
responsible, principled, and respected persons nationwide had 
rallied, then this harrowing experience might have been avoided. 
Presumably, [words indistinct] when you take the two former 
leaders into account. Anyway, Gen. Buhari agreed. He said: It 
is time for the return of reason. Decent people should no 
longer leave matters in the hands of irresponsible elements.

Ministry of Finance took place in Abuja. It was presided over 
by the finance minister, Dr. Kalu Idika Kalu. Correspondent 
Justice Imane's report is presented from our studio: 
  Speaking at the opening session, the minister of finance, 
Dr. 
Kalu Idika Kalu, said the delegation had already visited 160 
countries, adding that their visit to Nigeria was approved by 
the Federal Government. The leader of the IMF mission, Mr. 
(Reynold MacHugh), said they were in Nigeria for consultations 
with the Nigerian Government and review the economic system in 
1993, as well as look into the government policy for 1994. 
  [Begin recording] [Words indistinct] in certain respects 
with 
respect to the rightness or the wrongness of certain policies 
but in the end we attach enormous value to maintaining the 
dialogue with Nigeria and, as you said, as a member of the 
international fund, we, of course, have the obligation to 
maintain the dialogue with the Nigerian authorities. [end 
recording] 
  After the opening session, the officials of the

Finance went into closed-door consultations.

  [Text] This morning at about 0815, following an incident 
between Ghanaian security forces and smugglers, gunshots were 
heard on the Ghanaian side of the Aflao border town. The 
shooting, which was heard in Lome, provoked a movement of panic 
among the peaceful people of our capital. As our security 
forces posted around the Protestatnt High School were getting 
ready to face any threat, there was another serious incident in 
which one person was wounded. 
  The government hereby reassures the people and asks them to 
go about their normal business. One may recall that during two 
recent meetings between Togolese and Ghanaian security 
officials, it was agreed that every effort would be made to 
prevent shooting in order not to cause panic among the people on 
both sides of the border.

  [Text] The Togolese people are now only four days away from 
the legislative elections. Of course, the political parties are 
deeply involved in the campaign. Nonetheless, there is a 
dispute within the opposition. Here is Raphael Mbadinga: 
  [Begin recording] [Mbadinga] There is especially a war of 
words among the opposition parties. Those who are in favor of 
boycotting the 6 February elections are accusing the moderate 
opposition of seeking to legitimize President Gnassingbe 
Eyadema's government by taking part in the elections. According 
to the radical opposition, President Eyadema's government has 
not yet met all the conditions for truly democratic elections. 
Zarifou Ayeva is critical of the attitude of the moderate 
opposition here: 
  [Ayeva] Regarding my friends in the opposition who have 
involved themselves unashamedly in this affair, I wonder how 
they will find their way out. One only has to observe France's 
position. Minister Roussin is already withdrawing his support 
for the presidential elections. Tomorrow, faced with the 
worsening situation on the ground, France will withdraw again. 
  [Mbadinga] The moderate opposition has reacted by saying, 
and 
I quote, the Togolese people are tired. They have had enough of 
endless political transition. The legislative elections could 
therefore be a solution to the Togolese crisis, unquote. These 
petty squabbles of the opposition are publicly embarked upon in 
the country's privately owned newspapers. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] It's today since the Burundi opposition postponed 
the two-day general strike call until next Monday [7 February]. 
[sentence as heard] The idea was to allow people in Bujumbura to 
get some shopping and for workers to collect their pay packets. 
The strike call was a protest against the appointment of a new 
president to replace Melchior Ndadaye, who was killed in an Army 
uprising last October, and the final trigger was the sacking by 
the largely Hutu government of the Constitutional Court at the 
weekend. It was dominated by Tutsi judges. Since then, there's 
been a wave of ethnic killings in Bujumbura. The death toll has 
been put at around 60, and that kept a lot of people off the 
streets yesterday. And last night, more violence left a further 
10 dead. On the line to Bujumbura, Josephine Hazely asked our 
correspondent, Bonaventure Ndiguimana, what the situation was 
today: 
  [Begin recording] [Ndiguimana] I think the situation is very 
tense and dangerously evolving. Since yesterday night, there 
were so many grenade blasts, and gunfire was heard all night 
long. If we consider the number of casualties, 10 in one night, 
10 wounded--including three gendarmes--and if we add those to 
the 46 announced yesterday by the gendarmerie, we can say that 
the situation is seriously jeopardized. 
  [Hazely] So, have you been down to the town center today at 
all? 
  [Ndiguimana] Yes, I have been downtown. The traffic was at 
minimum. Many businesses were closed down. Public offices were 
closed down, but private cars could circulate freely, since the 
road blockades were removed. But I can say that public 
transport was very much disrupted. 
  [Hazely] Now, I understand the opposition met with the Army 
yesterday. Is there any word on what went on between the two 
groups? 
  [Ndiguimana] No, nothing released out of the meeting. No 
official statement was released. Some rumors had said that they 
were plotting a coup d'etat, but this has been denied by the 
chief of staff in charge of gendarmeries. Some news had said 
that the Army and the opposition were organizing the coup. It 
is not true. 
  [Hazely] I understand that the human rights league has made 
a statement about the situation in Burundi, especially in the 
capital, Bujumbura. What is the main source of the message? 
  [Ndiguimana] The two human rights leagues, ITECA and SONERA 
[expansions not given], have issued statements, calling 
politicians to be aware of the situation of their people who are 
in the countryside and those who are dying in the capital city. 
So, they have condemned acts of violence, and they have called 
the government to restore the judges of the Constitutional Court 
in their duties. The UN special envoy in Bujumbura, Mr. 
Abdallah, also issued a strong message to the political class, 
saying that they should look into the direction of restoring 
peace and order because war is not solution in this country.

  [Excerpt] Talks in Pretoria between the government, the ANC 
[African National Congress], and the Freedom Alliance have again 
ended in deadlock and will probably resume on Monday [7 
February]. 
  The ANC refused to present its package of proposals to the 
alliance before the leaders of the group committed themselves to 
being flexible. The ANC asked the alliance to obtain such a 
commitment from their leaders and report back no later than 
Monday. If the report back was positive, the talks would resume 
on Monday. 
  The Freedom Alliance has indicated that it prefers an agenda 
to a proposal or package, and that it wants to discuss issues 
point by point. In terms of the government package, the 
alliance must accept the rulings of the provincial power as 
outlined in the constitution if it wants the government to 
accept the double ballot paper. The alliance must furthermore 
agree to the retention of the present provisions governing the 
entrenchment of provincial constitutions. [passage omitted]

  [Text] UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola] has admitted the possibility of a cease-fire in Angola, 
but with a number of provisos. The condition set by UNITA is 
that the Angolan Government must be prepared to discuss the 
matter at the highest military level. This is stated in a UNITA 
communique dated 3 February and signed by [Chief of Staff] 
General Ben Ben. 
  The communique notes UNITA's satisfaction with the agreement 
on a national police force reached at the Lusaka talks, but this 
satisfaction is tempered by Gen. Ben Ben's concern over 
statements by Joao de Matos, chief of the Angolan Armed Forces' 
General Staff, whom the communique accuses of having called for 
the continuation of the war in Angola despite the progress made 
at the Lusaka talks. 
  Gen. Joao de Matos's statements were made before his 
departure for Brazil, where he is now. Gen. Ben Ben believes 
that de Matos was not expressing a personal view but was 
speaking for the Angolan Government. The communique says that 
UNITA leaves it to the Angolan people to judge who is making 
money out of purchasing arms from Brazil while the Angolans are 
starving to death. 
  The communique ends with praise for UN representative 
Alioune 
Beye for his role at the Lusaka talks.

to choose their president and the party whose program they like 
and trust the most. 
  Meanwhile, as elections approach--they are slightly less 
than 
10 months away--people are showing a growing interest in and 
want to know more about the philosophy and programs of each 
party and candidate in the elections. 
  With the aim of satisfying that public need, DOMINGO sent a 
questionnaire to the different political parties that have 
registered so far--namely, the People's Party for the Liberation 
of Mozambique, PPLM; the Mozambique Liberal and Democratic 
Party, Palmo; the Mozambique Democratic Party, Pademo; the 
Social Democratic Party, Sol; the Mozambique People's Progress 
Party, PPPM; the Mozambican Nationalist Movement, Monamo; the 
National Democratic Party, Panade; National Convention Party, 
PCN; the Mozambican National Union, Unamo; Mozambique United 
Front-Democratic Convergence and National Reconstruction Party, 
Fumo-PCDRN; and the Mozambique National Resistance, Renamo. 
  Our survey contained three questions: 1. What concrete 
strategies should be followed to bring the country's economy out 
of the chaos it is in? 2. What specific program should be 
implemented to ensure social progress (in areas such as health, 
education, culture, sport, and so on)? and 3. What foreign 
policy should be pursued? 
  We sent the questionnaires to 11 parties, but only five 
replied. They were: Pademo, PPPM, Monamo, PCN, and Unamo. Of 
those, the PCN gave us a negative answer, saying that the 
questions we asked are "of public interest and will certainly be 
topics for debate during the electoral campaign." This party 
added that such issues are part of its electoral program, which 
"will only be approved by a meeting of the congress to be held, 
in principle, in April, so we cannot divulge that information 
now or we would be violating our own statutes." Panade was 
contacted late, so it will only answer next week. 
  We did not send the questionnaire to the Mozambique 
Liberation Front, Frelimo, for reasons that we believe are 
obvious. As the present ruling party, Frelimo's program must be 
the one it is implementing at this stage. Among other things, 
we have the national reconstruction program, the social and 
economic rehabilitation program, and the industrial 
rehabilitation program. 
  DOMINGO will be carrying the parties' answers over the next 
few weeks and it will follow the order of the questions, with 
answers to the first, second, and third questions, respectively. 
The PPPM produced a response that is difficult to grasp because 
it gives one four-line answer to all three questions. 
  Our first question about concrete strategies for pulling 
Mozambique's economy out of the current chaos included some 
secondary questions: a) Concerning continuity or otherwise with 
the IMF restructuring program, in the event of severance, what 
other sources of financing would your party rely on? b) What 
sectorial policies (agriculture, industry, commerce, and 
tourism) and what priorities would you follow? c) Concerning 
foreign investment, what policies, strategies, or mechanisms 
should be implemented to benefit the country? d) What policies 
ought to be followed to control inflation and to improve the 
balance of payments? 
  Let us see how Pademo, the PPPM, Monamo, and Unamo answered 
this question. 
<H3>  1. Concrete Strategies To Pull the Country Out of Economic 
Chaos </H3>
  Pademo 
  a) Mozambique is already part of the world economic system, 
and, as such, a market economy must be the keyword. This is how 
our party sees it. The "Bretton Woods" institutions, notably 
the World Bank, WB, the IMF, and the Paris Club are, in general 
terms, the ones that "dictate" the rules of the game. In order 
to benefit from their financing, all countries that are members 
of those institutions must submit to their norms, but that does 
not mean that all recommendations issued by those monetary 
institutions must be followed blindly. 
  We have always believed that it is possible to negotiate 
with 
the "big shots" [preceding two words in English]. From Pademo's 
point of view, our country's membership to those institutions 
should be planned so that the recovery of national industry can 
be assured, the export sector is encouraged to produce more, 
more jobs are created, administrative reform is implemented, and 
control is exerted over the outflow of foreign currency, as well 
as over imports. It will only be possible for this country to 
benefit from loans from the WB, IMF, and other organizations 
such as the "Paris Club" if the government draws up a plan to 
get the economy back on its feet, thereby allowing the gross 
national product, GNP, and exports to increase. 
  Pademo believes that the relationship between the GNP and 
the 
foreign debt must be minimized and that efforts must be made for 
a more productive use of loans, which must not be used solely 
for importing luxury and unnecessary goods that can only benefit 
businessmen and their protectors, who are enriching themselves 
at the expense of the misery experienced by the majority of 
Mozambicans. 
<H5>  Agrarian Policy </H5>
  The majority of the Mozambican population lives in the rural 
areas, where, coincidentally, social and economic development is 
poorest. It is important to work out plans for a rural sector 
that will be of use to the peasants and other rural people, 
whereby production is constantly guided by the goals that are 
sought in the areas of participation and division and which 
should be implemented through the establishment of new 
production relations in the agricultural sector. 
  Given that the agrarian sector is very sensitive to climate 
factors and highly dependent on the degree of incentives 
available nationally and internationally, Pademo defends a 
policy of diversification of the agents who operate in that 
sector. In this way, the private, cooperative, and family 
sectors should be stimulated by the state, which will also be 
responsible for coordinating the work of those sectors, defining 
agrarian credit policies and prices, and buying agricultural 
surpluses to guarantee food security in the country. 
  Agriculture currently demands the intervention of 
technologies, equipments, and working methods that are 
increasingly complex, which must be introduced for use by 
persons who obtain the necessary scientific and technological 
skills, thereby improving the levels of education at rural and 
agricultural schools. Furthermore, for the sector to become 
more dynamic, there is the need to apply specific guidance 
measures pertaining to agricultural, forestry, and livestock 
production, as well as to establish a policy that will ensure 
order is brought to the rural areas. 
<H5>  Agriculture </H5>
  Pademo endorses the principle that the "cash crop" 
[preceding 
two words in English] and "food crop" [preceding two words in 
English] production areas must undergo proper planning, both at 
the central level and at the level of the federate states. As 
part of the colonial period's legacy, some parts of the country 
currently concentrate on "food crops" and others on "cash crops." 
  The party will support improvements in the technologies to 
be 
used by those two agricultural production areas, because both 
will help the country earn foreign currency. Furthermore, there 
is the need to define an agricultural industrialization policy 
that will see such industrialization at work in the areas where 
those crops are produced, thereby encouraging a reduction in 
losses and waste of those products. To that end, the Federal 
Institute for Science, Research, and Technology, in conjunction 
with potential national and foreign investors, will define the 
appropriate technologies for the processing of previously 
identified agricultural products. 
  In line with its land ownership policy, the party will issue 
land property deeds, but it will not enter into conflicts with 
the traditional system of each region. It will also define a 
land ownership policy for foreigners and for specific purposes. 
The most important aspects of that policy would have to be 
defined by the federal parliament. Any land transaction must be 
confirmed or made official by the Notary Services and can only 
be entered into by individuals in possession of a land property 
deed. 
  Pademo will also promote the creation of associations for 
farmers or peasants who unite to defend their interests. 
<H5>  Forestation </H5>
  It has been found over the last few years that enterprises, 
particularly foreign enterprises, have embarked on the wholesale 
destruction of our forests for the purpose of securing easy 
profits. In view of that, there is the need to define a 
forestation policy that will help bring order to the 
exploitation of those resources and that will also enhance 
silviculture planning. Within this context, the following are 
the most important points: 

  -  To define areas for production, conservation, and 
recreation; 
  -  To increase the area of productive forestation; 
  -  To expand tree planting areas, improve their protection, and 
improve pasture areas; 
  -  To exert rigorous control over landscapes, areas where land 
has 
been scorched, deforestation problems, and strive to defend 
local natural values; 
  -  To define a reforestation policy for wood-producing areas. 

<H5>    Livestock </H5>
  Livestock helps decisively to strengthen the gross 
agricultural product. Its importance within the context of the 
agrarian economy must not be underestimated. The livestock 
sector is, however, one of the weakest in our country because of 
the effects of the fratricidal war that has decimated both 
domestic cattle and wildlife. 
  The sector must receive significant investments so that 
priority can be given to increasing livestock numbers, sector 
productivity, and to foster a more correct integration of 
livestock into farming or other agricultural exploitation areas. 
  Such investments must also benefit the family sector, which 
contributes substantially toward livestock production in our 
country. Within that context, the party will strive for a 
return of livestock to the rural areas and to the national game 
parks. The parastatal and private sectors must also be 
mobilized so they become actively involved in this area. 
  To that end, Pademo plans to promote concrete action for a 
well-integrated operation. Such plans would include: 

  -  The adoption of realistic policies for the sectors dealing 
with resettling and feeding cattle. Nationally produced food 
resources must be promoted whenever possible; 
  -  With the help of cattle breeders, an effective program must 
be 
established in each federated state to provide hygiene care and 
protection for existing livestock; 
  -  To draw up regional plans that will guide livestock 
production 
so as to make livestock production part of development plans, 
but without ignoring the ecological balance of the areas 
involved; 
  -  To define the real potential and the correctness of livestock 
production in each area, as well as to place and guide intensive 
livestock exploitation in the areas of hog, goat, and poultry 
raising; 
  -  To promote the modernization of the premises and equipment 
used 
by livestock companies so as to make them technologically viable; 
  -  To promote the creation of associations of cattle farmers and 
livestock entrepreneurs whose help the state will seek for 
technical assistance and professional training purposes, thereby 
improving conditions for exploitation. 

<H3>    Industrial, Natural Resources, and Environment Protection 
Policies </H3>
  Industry has a most important role to play in the creation 
of 
the material and social conditions on which the country's 
prosperity and the well-being of the citizens must rest. The 
rehabilitation of existing industrial assets and the 
development, or introduction, of other industries, are priority 
tasks for Pademo. Such operations will, to a great extent, 
function as the engine for the promotion of training and for the 
optimal use of human resources, with a view to promoting 
employment. Natural resources, whether they be in the mining, 
agricultural, or fishing sectors, must also be given attention 
so as to create the wealth that will absorb consumption needs. 
The social sector must also be expanded, whether it be housing, 
health care, education security, or cultural development. The 
country's industrial growth must be guaranteed by all federated 
states in a decentralized manner. Attention must always be 
given to the defense of the environment and industrial units 
must be integrated into the areas in which they operate. 
<H5>  Within the Industrial Sector </H5>
  With regard to industry, the exploitation and use of natural 
resources, and environmental protection, Pademo plans to promote 
the following actions: 

  -  To adopt an industrial policy that will guarantee a 
balanced distribution of industries in the country, both at the 
level of federated states and at regional level. 
  -  To uphold an industrial policy that will be backed by a 
policy 
promoting academic, technical, and professional training, 
thereby ensuring that professionals find employment and that 
industry has the qualified workers it needs. 
  -  To define an industrial planning strategy that will take into 
account the fact that Mozambique is a third world country that 
produces raw materials for the international market. In view of 
that, specialization must be sought to ensure that the country 
produces profitable export goods. 
  -  To promote support and assistance in the form of loans and 
other incentives -- to be approved by central parliament -- to 
those large and small enterprises that give a positive 
contribution to social and economic development by attracting 
and investing capital, increasing production and productivity, 
and by creating jobs. 
  -  To take energetic measures, in coordination with the trade 
unions, against the reduction of surplus [nao justificado] 
labor, the closure of factories, and dismissals without just 
cause. The state must exert control and authority over those 
enterprises that show an incapacity to abide by their 
responsibilities concerning fiscal taxes and the payment of 
salaries. 
  -  To show commitment in helping Mozambican citizens establish 
small and intermediate enterprises by means of awarding them 
loans and granting them lighter fiscal duties, depending on the 
level of development of the areas where such enterprises are 
located. 
  -  To define the energy sector as decisive for a successful 
industrial policy and as being of strategic importance for the 
country's social and economic system. This sector must be 
strongly connected with great state corporations and the state 
must have powerful control over it. In this way, the oil, coal, 
and gas subsectors must be organized in the form of a national 
"holding" [preceding word in English]. The electricity 
subsector will also be reorganized so that it becomes a single 
federal enterprise that will be responsible for producing, 
storing, and distributing electricity throughout the country. 
It must also show the capacity to promote electrification 
throughout Mozambican territory. 
  -  To set single tariffs for the various forms of energy 
throughout the federation. There will be the need to review the 
prices currently charged to domestic and industrial consumers. 
  -  To promote and increase research concerning new ways of 
picking 
up and processing energy, particularly geothermal energy in 
areas where it can be put to good use, notably solar energy and 
in cases of regional power failures. 
  -  To promote norms and criteria that will guarantee the 
participation of administrative organs of the government of each 
federated state in the drawing up of industrial sector plans, 
programs, and contracts, as well as to follow up their 
implementation. 
  -  To define in legal terms the obligations of the larger 
enterprises in the training of personnel and in the areas of 
research and development, as well as to draw up a technology 
transfer code that will protect the national economy in its 
contracts with other countries. 

<H5>    Within the Context of the Natural Resources Sector </H5>
  The natural resources of the federation are the property of 
the federal state and their use will be controlled by the 
federal state. It is up to the federated states to participate 
in the drawing up of plans and contracts, as well as to control 
the implementation of those plans and contracts. 
  Natural resources include geothermal resources, mineral 
deposits, quarries, and waters (whether they be natural waters, 
mineral waters for industrial production, or natural mineral 
waters). 
  c) [as published] Foreign investment must be attracted and 
encouraged by setting up an effective bureaucratic machine and 
by introducing a tax policy that will be both more attractive 
and more realistic. Pademo believes that there should be a 
division of the sectors where economic agents are to act and 
define taxes in accordance with the perceived level of risk in 
each given sector. 
  d) Our party advocates a policy of economic integration for 
the peasant majority of Mozambican people. That majority 
currently contributes little toward the national economy. 
Inflation control requires political and economic measures that 
out party has already outlined and which it will submit to an 
elected assembly for approval. We did not think it was 
opportune to convey those plans to a newspaper before the 
electoral campaign has begun. One thing is certain: It will 
only be possible to improve the balance of payments by making 
local industry and the rendering of services both more effective 
and more competitive. 
<H5>  PPPM </H5>
  "The specific strategy to pull the country out of economic 
chaos, to promote social progress, and to devise a foreign 
policy is to build federalism, meaning political 
decentralization including powers of a statutory nature, 
fundamental legislation, and political (?powers) in general, in 
addition to administrative, economic, and financial autonomy." 
[sentence as published] 
<H5>  Monamo/PMSD </H5>
  "I. If Monamo/PMSD wins the legislative elections, it 
cannot, 
unfortunately, form a government, since only the candidate 
elected to the Presidency of the Republic can form the 
government, according to the existing political constitution 
which provides for a presidential regime, contrary to 
Monamo/PMSD's proposal for a semi- presidential regime, which 
combines the good aspects of both presidential and parliamentary 
regimes, according to the dictum "in medius virtus" [virtue is 
in the middle]. 
  II. If Monamo/PMSD is called upon to form the government or 
even in opposition, it will always defend its political 
ideology, its government program of action, and its economic, 
political, and social plan. Having said this, we shall now 
answer DOMINGO's questionnaire. 
<H3>  1. Concrete Strategies To Pull the Country Out of Economic 
Chaos </H3>
  a) Taking into account the country's economic, political, 
and 
social situation, Monamo/PMSD feels, unfortunately, that it 
cannot ignore the International Monetary Fund's [IMF] 
conditions, since we owe a lot to this fund and other financial 
bodies. 
  All the same, it will renegotiate the debt and readjust the 
rules of the game defining international financing to our 
country's realities, so that in the shortest period possible, we 
can establish an equilibrium and settle the debt, through 
surplus budgets and balances of payment. 
  Monamo/PMSD will give priority to sources of financing for 
productive investment, which will check the export of foreign 
currency. 
  Our country has the potential to produce cereals in 
abundance and, so, it does not need cereals from the 
international market. Even wheat can be produced in sufficient 
quantities to cover internal needs. We can make bread from 
wheat, corn, rice, sorghum, and cassava flour. 
  The main sources of financing should be national, coming 
from 
state revenue obtained from the exploration of the Cahora Basssa 
Hydroelectric Dam, Pande gas, mineral resources, cashew nuts, 
and prawns. 
  b) Agriculture will be the fundamental sector of our 
economy, 
in that it will absorb over 70 percent of our active population, 
who will be engaged in subsistence agriculture. Monamo/PMSD 
feels, however, that the plantation of cotton, oil-producing 
plants, cashew nut trees, sugar cane, tea, and tobacco should be 
industrialized to readjust the balance of payments. 
  The energetic industrial sector (fuel, electricity, gas, and 
coal), salt pits, fishery, agricultural and livestock 
byproducts, exploration of precious stones and metallurgy in 
Tete region, which is rich in iron, coal, energy and water, are 
essential for the production of national steel. 
  Trade will only be of major importance to the country if it 
involves internal and external trade of national food products, 
cereals, vegetables, meet, fish, prawns, drinks, textile, and 
others, without imports or with reduced imports of essential 
commodities, such as fuel, machinery, and technology. 
  Tourism constitutes one of the major sources of foreign 
currency. To realize this, it will be necessary to rehabilitate 
existing hotels, offer good service, and engage in necessary 
advertisement and "marketing" [preceding word in English]. 
  c) The first condition for foreign investment is the 
security 
of people and goods, economic stability, and an attractive code 
of foreign investment, which will also defend national 
sovereignty. 
  In the field of national economics, the Mozambican state 
should provide certain fiscal benefits to foreign companies, as 
well as be willing to finance some of them, as long as they 
provide major opportunities for the employment of nationals. 
The extent of the project in national terms and its propensity 
to generate medium and small national satellite companies should 
also be considered. 
  d) Inflation can only be controlled if there is greater 
productivity and subsequently greater national production, less 
devaluation of the metical, control in printing currency, a 
certain restriction in importing nonessential products and a 
foreign exchange policy which conforms with our financial 
conditions. Our balance of payments will for many years to come 
still be in deficit, but with a good service in our ports, 
railroads, revenues from emigrants, workers in South African 
mines, and tourism, a significant increase in the export of 
electricity from the Cahora Bassa Dam, Pande gas, cashew nuts, 
tea, sugar, cotton, manufacturing, and others, we can readjust 
and increase our balance of payments during the next 10 to 15 
years." 
<H5>  Unamo </H5>
  1. The only strategy to remove the country from its present 
chaos is through a federal government. 
  a) Mozambique is a big and rich country. There are many 
countries worldwide with a spirit of good will, ready to assist 
in the reconstruction and development of this country, in case 
relations with the IMF become sour. What is more, the country 
has its own sources of wealth. The only problem was 
mismanagement by the country's rulers. 
  b) We must give priority to agriculture, small industries, 
trade, and tourism. 
  The agricultural program should involve the following: 
Financing small farmers, small industries, small traders. 
Because our country is big and highly populated, it must be 
developed by the nationals themselves. Unfortunately, this is 
not being observed at the moment because of a lack of priorities. 
  Tourism: Tourism should be encouraged by the state and 
supported by businessmen in the country, to increasingly attract 
the international community, thus enabling us to obtain more 
foreign exchange. 
  c) Foreigners should be called upon to invest in the country 
as much as they can, considering how big and rich the country 
is. In turn, they should be allowed to remit a certain 
percentage to their home countries or where the capital came 
from. 
  d) To control inflation and improve the balance of payments, 
we should increase production in the country. Thus, it will be 
easy to control foreign market forces and readjust our balance 
of payment accordingly. Considering that the government policy 
will be directed toward increasing production, it will not be 
necessary to import everything.

  [Text] The Government of Burkina Faso and the Government of 
the Republic of China, determined to promote bilateral bonds of 
friendship and cooperation between the two states based on the 
universally recognized principles of international law, have 
decided to resume diplomatic relations at ambassadorial level as 
of 2 February. The designation of ambassadors will be done 
through diplomatic channels. 
  The agreement was signed in Taipei on 2 February, 
corresponding to the second day of the second month of the [word 
indistinct] year of the Republic of China. It was signed for 
the Government of Burkina Faso by External Relations Minister 
Thomas Sanon and for the Government of the Republic of China by 
acting Foreign Minister Chin-Yen Fang. 
  In line with the resumption of diplomatic relations between 
Ouagadougou and Taipei, the Burkinabe Government has issued a 
statement, which is read here by Theodore Kilimite Hien, the 
communications minister and government spokesman: 
  [Hien] Today, 2 February, the Government of Burkina Faso and 
the Government of the Republic of China, have decided to resume 
their diplomatic relations which were suspended in 1973. The 
resumption of relations with the Republic of China is based on 
the Burkinabe Government's willingness to establish relations 
and bonds of cooperation with all countries of the world for 
mutual benefit. 
  At a time when African countries are confronted with 
terrible 
economic difficulties that are even threatening national unity, 
it is imperative for Burkina Faso to widen the circle of her 
friendship and to find partners in every part of the world, who 
are willing to support her development efforts in a continuous 
manner. By resuming normal relations with Taipei, the Burkinabe 
Government has obtained the assurance from the Republic of China 
that it will help our country on its path toward achieving 
progress through the following channels: Self-sufficiency in 
food production through a special agricultural development 
program, namely rice and soya bean production, the promotion of 
the informal sector, the reduction of unemployment, the 
revamping of youth employment schemes, the development and 
improvement of the health sector, and the building of a sports 
infrastructure, including the construction of a sports complex 
in Bobo Dioulasso and a sports stadium in Ouagadougou. This 
initial program will be pursued through a wider range of 
operations in the future. 
  In resuming relations with Taipei, the Burkinabe Government 
remains faithful to the fundamental option of its external 
policy, which is based on realistic views and adjustment to the 
changes that are now marking international society. It is in 
line with the same policy of loyalty that Burkina Faso hereby 
reaffirms its willingness to maintain, to pursue, and to 
consolidate its relations with the People's Republic of China. 
  Signed in Ouagadougou on 2 February 1994.

  [Text] Addis Ababa, 4 Feb. (PANA)--The 59th ordinary 
session of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) Council of 
Ministers ended in Addis Ababa on Friday [4 February], with the 
approval of a 59.66- million-dollar programme budget for the 
biennium 1994/96 for the continental body. 
  The biennial budget, the first of its kind since the 
creation 
of the OAU in 1963, reflects the priorities of the organisation 
at a time when it is being called upon to shoulder more 
responsibilities, especially in the area of conflict resolution 
in the continent. 
  The meeting, which began on Monday, also adopted a number of 
resolutions on political and economic matters affecting some of 
the organisation's 52 member-states. 
  The ministers deplored the fact that conflicts now persist 
in 
Africa and hailed the establishment of a mechanism for conflict 
resolution, which they said was "a step that would enable Africa 
to take control of its own problems, to which it should find 
solutions without foreign interference." 
  On South Africa, the council appealed to each member state 
to 
send at least two observers to reinforce the OAU mission in 
South Africa to monitor the all-race elections scheduled to take 
place as from 26 April. It also urged the contries to 
contribute to the special fund to assist the liberation 
movements in the elections. 
  On Burundi, the council endorsed the establishment of an OAU 
mission in Bujumbura to promote dialogue and national 
reconciliation following the violence and kilings prevalent in 
the country since the failed coup of October 1993. It appealed 
to the people of Burundi and all the political parties to 
cooperate with the OAU mission, whose aim is purely to help the 
people of Burundi regain peace, confidence, and security. 
  On the situation in Angola, where renewed fighting erupted 
after the 1992 election won by the MPLA [Popular Movement for 
the Liberation of Angola] government, the council said it 
"strongly condemns UNITA [National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola] for the escalation of military action 
and for its persistent occuptation of towns, villages, and small 
areas, which have undermined the peace process." 
  It urged leaders of the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola (UNITA) to negotiate seriously at the 
current talks in Lusaka and reach an agreement with the Angolan 
Government so that a durable cease-fire accord could be signed. 
  The council also appealed to member states and the 
international community to give full political, diplomatic, and 
material support to the MPLA government so as to enable it to 
restore peace. 
  The council adopted a resolution on Somalia where American 
troops serving with the United Nations peacekeeping are to 
withdraw by the end of March. It called on the United Nations 
to work in close coordination with the OAU and the Ethiopian 
president to facilitate political reconciliation and 
implementation of all agreements reached by all the Somalian 
factions. 
  The council observed that "restoration of peace in Somalia 
remains essentially the responsibility of Somalis and that the 
internatimnal community can only help them in the realisation of 
that objective."

<F P=106> [Inaugural speech by President Cyprien Ntaryamira in </F>
Bujumbura on 5 February--live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] Ladies and Gentlemen, before I embark on my 
speech, allow me to thank the religious leaders of our country, 
to thank them wholeheartedly for the blessing they have just 
poured on us and the blessing of God they have just showered on 
Burundi. I think that if God has not heard the prayers, then he 
must have already left our country. [passage omitted] 
  Burundi ladies and gentlemen, Burundi has really suffered 
and 
greed has exacerbated the already bad situation. You have 
either heard about it or have seen it for yourselves: houses, 
bridges, schools, hospitals in many parts of the country have 
been destroyed because of the crisis which has just prevailed in 
Burundi. People killed one another, and those who managed to 
escape in the regions concerned became helpless refugees and 
fled elsewhere within the country. Others sought sanctuary in 
neighboring countries. The refugees who fled these troubles, who 
are outside the country, exceed 700,000. The internal refugees, 
excluding those in the valleys and in the bush, exceed 200,000. 
We have not yet clearly established the number of victims of 
this disaster, but you know that they number thousands, and that 
will take Burundi backwards economically and socially. 
  All Burundians need peace and mutual trust so that they can 
live together once more. Mutual distrust and hatred among the 
people should be fought against strongly. Burundi is in 
bereavement [kubura]. All Burundians are in bereavement. 
Please overcome your anger so that hatred (?does not build). 
There is also a saying that by avenging your own people, you 
bring about the end of your family. Burundi is a common farm 
given to us by God. It will never be divided into two or three 
parts. Burundians should once more come together, unite in 
restoring peace, restoring security so that our country may 
prosper once more. 
  Whoever dreams about worsening the situation so that Burundi 
remains in crisis, I call on you to strongly reject him without 
condoning evil. I take this opportunity to remind Burundians 
who still dream of destruction and [word indistinct], and, more 
particularly, members of some opposition parties, let them look 
at the misery confronting our helpless Burundian brothers and 
then stop their designs which can bring nothing to us other than 
adding insult to injury. The times we are living through are 
not right for arguments but rather for rescuing each other. 
  We urge Burundians who still dream of shedding blood, all 
those who are behaving in a riotous manner, those who spend 
their time brandishing their weapons at each other--we urge them 
to remember that they did not create those they threaten and 
that they are not at all allowed to torture or (?harm) those of 
different political or ethnic affiliations. Respect for human 
life is upheld worldwide, and we are going to take swift 
measures to stop killings which are rampant in Burundi. 
  In our programs, in which we believe and will be teaching, 
we 
must make all Burundians understand that it is an offense to 
abuse human rights. No matter who is concerned--whether he is a 
Hutu, Tutsi, or Twa--his life, his family, and his property must 
be respected. There is no tribe destined for extermination, no 
tribe to be trampled upon, no tribe better than another; a 
tribe for killing, one for preserving alone. All 
Burundians--whether they are Hutu, Tutsi, or Twa--are equal 
before God and the law. 
  We call on all the registered parties of Burundi to work 
accordingly towards the goal of reconciliation and 
reconstruction. We call upon them to do their utmost to assist 
the government in strengthening peace and tranquility in the 
country for the benefit of all Burundians without bringing 
hatred among ethnic groups. I promise to always meet party 
leaders so that we may study how peace and tranquility are never 
disturbed again. 
  However, members and leaders of parties must know that a 
party does not give the green light to its leaders or its 
members to be carefree, to intentionally break the law. The 
government will not hesitate to punish a law breaker, 
irrespective of his identity, even if he is a party leader. 
  I also take this opportunity to remind the youth, because 
they have a great role to play in building the Burundi of 
tomorrow -- we call upon them to come back to their senses. We 
ask them to avoid deceitful advisers who want nothing from them 
other than to use them as tools. [passage omitted] Parents, who 
are in charge of education, are called upon to be a good example 
in upholding unity, peace and understanding. Let them avoid 
sowing seeds of division of any kind, because by so doing they 
will be digging a grave for Burundi. There is an old saying 
that he who steals while carrying a baby on his back teaches the 
latter to do the same. [passage omitted] 
  Burundians, the recent killings that the country has been 
experiencing have caused clear mistrust amongst the people, 
especially on ethnic grounds. Many among you may be asking 
yourselves whether it is still possible for Burundians to live 
together as before. Most of you may be asking yourselves how 
the future government will behave so that citizens may once more 
live together in peace, government employees work hard for 
development once more, so that those who have fled their homes 
may return unhindered, so that those with arms may lay them 
down, so that the ever-increasing banditry may be stopped, and 
many other questions that we do not want to talk about. All 
those questions to yourselves are being asked at the right time 
and because of what has happened. 
  However, there is no remedy other than all of us agreeing 
that the laws and rules of the country should be respected first 
so that we may work in peace. That is why we ask the security 
services to open their eyes more. They should work impartially, 
stop the bad actions which keep on causing problems in our 
country. We shall be very happy when we see them heeding this 
call, when they carry out their duties without hesitation (?and 
impartially). 
  In summary, we are going to act fast to restore discipline 
in 
the country, discipline in the army, discipline in schools, 
discipline in leadership, discipline in the whole of Burundi so 
that Burundians may respect each other, respect the laws and 
pursue their work, the source of development. Nothing else will 
save Burundi apart from work, justice and respect for human 
rights. [passage omitted] 
  Burundi ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow morning we will form 
the government that will help us to implement our programs to 
revive Burundi in all its sectors. You have heard for the past 
few days that we have been meeting party leaders, church leaders 
and representatives of international organizations, namely the 
United Nations and the OAU. You will hear later on about what we 
agreed on the government that we intend to form. However, I 
would like to tell you about the main points that we shall 
implement soon. 
  First, the prime minister will be chosen after looking into 
the current political problems in the country, especially the 
current ethnic conflicts that we have been experiencing. We 
shall appoint him after assessing his wisdom and courage and 
after assessing whether he is committed to peace and democracy 
for all. As we agreed during the discussions that we held with 
other political leaders, we shall choose him from the largest 
opposition party. After studying his behaviour during the 
difficult times that we have undergone, after ensuring that he 
has had no hand in the recent killings and disturbances. The 
next prime minister will be a wise man or woman who unreservedly 
agrees to assist the president in his duty to implement programs 
so that the new Burundi we want takes root. 
  Second, the men and women to be appointed to the Burundi 
Government will also show proof of leadership and enough 
knowledge in assisting the head of state to find solutions to 
the problems facing Burundi currently, whether political or 
economic. As you know, the task of forming the government 
belongs to the head of state in consultation with the prime 
minister. We shall carry out the job as soon as possible in 
accordance first, with the ideas of the Front for Democracy in 
Burundi [FRODEBU] party which won the elections. We shall also 
appoint senior government employees in consultation with the 
prime minister and ministers, bearing in mind the good of the 
country, and without discrimination. We ask all those charged 
with these duties to carry them out for the common good and that 
they show determination to revive our country. 
  The main goals of the government that we shall form in the 
near future will be as follows: First, to pacify the country 
and do everything possible so that peace, tranquillity and 
mutual trust return among all Burundians. Second, to teach 
respect for human rights in the entire country. Third, to 
resettle the displaced without forgetting the previously planned 
repatriation of refugees from abroad. Concerning the revival of 
the economy. 
  The government will strive to rebuild what has been 
destroyed 
in the recent disturbances. However, this is a job for 
everyone. The government will also revamp the country's economy 
through all the activities in our country. It will also 
continue the projects that had been halted due to the recent 
disturbances. [passage omitted] 
  Burundi ladies and gentlemen, I cannot conclude this address 
without wholeheartedly thanking the Burundians and foreigners 
who made sacrifices or assisted in enabling Burundi to reach 
this stage. Allow me to particulary thank the Government of 
Burundi which was led by Her Excellency Sylvie Kinigi [short 
break in transmission] Ntibantunganya. We also thank those who 
contributed towards getting Burundi out of the crisis, 
particularly neighboring and friendly countries, international 
organizations such as the United Nations and OAU, private 
businessmen, religious leaders and whoever made any contribution 
to the return of peace or helped our victims. Please join me in 
hailing them. I take this opportunity to ask them to continue 
supporting us as they have always done. [passage omitted]

  [Text] President Idriss Deby has just ended a 48-hour tour 
of Abeche and Ouaddai following the unfortunate events of last 
August and the recent incidents in Abeche last January. He went 
to the region to appease the local people and to extend the 
government's sympathy to the bereaved families. He also 
pardoned some people who had been detained for their role in the 
23 January attack on Abeche. Furthermore, members of the Chadian 
National Front will be dispatched to Moussoro where they will be 
trained and integrated in the Chadian National Army. Deby urged 
sultans and other village chiefs to leave no stone unturned to 
bring back those who deserted their families. Let us listen to 
the head of state: 
  [Begin Deby recording] We must find a solution that will 
restore tranquility and calm in Ouaddai and ensure that the 
people live in concord. This cannot be achieved without the 
assistance of canton chiefs. We cannot solve your many problems 
unless we all do away once and for all with a number of evils 
that have undermined the region. I therefore urge you -- 
administrative authorities, sultans, and canton heads who wield 
considerable moral influence -- to help me as head of state and 
son of the region to safeguard peace and unity in this part of 
Chad and to restore the former luster of Ouaddai. I must stress 
that any conflicts in the region prompted by material 
considerations should stop. Let the traditional rulers assume 
their responsibilities and fully play their role as assistants 
to administrative authorities. The sultan must fully assume his 
historic responsibility and run Ouaddai Region in line with the 
tradition. [applause] 
  Through you, paramount chiefs and canton heads, I extend a 
hand to our brothers who fled the region on 23 January. I urge 
them to see reason. We are prepared to receive them; we are 
prepared to hold talks with them; the government is prepared to 
hold sincere talks with them in the supreme interest of both our 
region and our country. [end recording]

  [Text] General Jacques Joachim Yhombi-Opango, prime 
minister and head of government, returned to Brazzaville this 
morning after a week's stay in Paris. He was there to represent 
Congo at the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the 
Brazzaville Conference. 
  The Congolese prime minister used this opportunity to hold 
discussions with French authorities and businessmen on the 
political and economic situation prevailing in Congo. His 
interlocutors included French Cooperation Minister Michel 
Roussin, Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac, Socialist Party Secretary 
General Michel Rocard, the French defense minister's delegate, 
and UNESCO Director General Frederico Mayor. The topics they 
discussed included the political situation prevailing in Congo, 
cooperation between France and Congo, and the devaluation of the 
CFA franc. Was it an easy task? Here are the details from 
Prime Minister Yhombi-Opango: 
  [Begin recording] [Yhombi-Opango] No task is ever easy. What 
is lacking in the current situation is communication. There is 
lack of communication. Before my departure for France, the 
government reported on the situation at a cabinet meeting, 
noting that there is lack of communication and lack of 
understanding of the government's message. That is why the head 
of state's recommendations to the government stated that the 
activities of our embassies should be reactivated at the level 
of the EEC countries, mainly, with Rome and Brussels. In regard 
to the financial and business circles, we shall not rush into 
anything. Discussions should be held first. We contacted some 
business circles to invite them back to our country for 
discussions. Economic issues are not tackled in the same way as 
political issues. Economic issues are tackled with documents 
and files and we have to present them. I took the liberty to 
invite some French financial backers to come here to assess the 
various fields that will be identified and to see how to revive 
our cooperation. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Do you agree to continue talks 
with the IMF? 
  [Opango] Of course, yes. Our discussions with the IMF to 
reach an agreement are well under way. We are still waiting for 
the results of our discussions. I will first meet with the head 
of state and then with members of government for a speedy 
response that will be conveyed to the IMF. I am convinced that 
by the end of the week a memorandum of understanding 
representing the concrete beginning of the establishment of our 
program will be signed. 
  [Correspondent] A last question, Mr. Prime Minister. What 
about the negotiations relating to the Arbitral College and the 
consultations between parliamentarians from Pool and Gnari 
Provinces? 
  [Opango] I would like to say that I was very happy to see 
that the Arbitral College has handed down its verdict, a verdict 
everybody was waiting for and on which many rumors circulated. 
I felt particularly moved not only because of the results 
themselves but by the attitude of the politicians who went to 
Libreville and by the various statements they made. Each of 
them made it a point to say that they will abide by the verdict 
of the college on the electoral dispute which means that 
henceforth, the electoral process in our country has been 
completed and it is now up to the government, with the agreement 
of the president of the Republic and the friends who assisted us 
to solve this crisis, to see in which way things could be 
clarified and how to proceed with the organization of 
by-elections. 
  I am saying here that when our politicians face their 
responsibility -- as is the case here -- to abide by a verdict, 
this shows that there is a certain spirit that is being 
established in our country and that can turn things around and 
bring hope to the our people. 
  In regard to the communique signed by parliamentarians from 
Gnari and Pool Provinces, it was very important. We even took 
the liberty to disclose it officially at the dinner that was 
held on the occasion of the celebration of the 50th anniversary 
of the Brazzaville Conference and all our partners warmly 
applauded the news because it meant the beginning of the return 
of peace in our country. Believe me, our country has many 
friends. Our country is respected abroad so when people talk 
about us in terms of weapons, guns, and rifles, it does not 
befit our image. We are a country that is still respected in 
France. The French are happy to recall that it was in 
Brazzaville that many actions were first initiated. [end

place and date not given] 
  [Text] The Congolese Workers' Federation [CSTC] has issued 
a communique pointing out that its 25 January ultimatum to the 
government expires at midnight on 6 February. In view of the 
government's silence, which is certainly due to the fact that 
the prime minister was away on an official visit in France, and 
in order to show its good faith and readiness to negotiate, the 
CSTC executive council renews and reiterates its proposal to 
negotiate with the government and employers on the major issues 
outlined in the ultimatum. This should take place within a 
period of 10 days, starting from 7 February, that is, from 7 
February up to and including 16 February. Once that deadline 
has expired, a strike notice will be issued to embark on an 
indefinite nationwide strike. 
  [Signed] Louis Gandou, CSTC secretary general.

<F P=106> [Government communique issued in Libreville on 4 February; </F>
read by Lazare Digombet, minister of culture, arts, and human 
rights--recorded] 
  [Text] Recently, more than 200 clandestine immigrants were 
intercepted by members of the National Gendarmerie. On 2 
February, they were assembled at the Rebouket Camp for 
repatriation. 
  Authorities from the Nigerian Embassy, whose countrymen 
constituted the largest number of intercepted immigrants, 
visited the latter and promised to make the necessary 
arrangements for their return. When the cells were opened early 
Thursday, 3 February, the gendarmes were surprised to observe 
that several of the the immigrants were dead. 
  As soon as it was notified about this tragedy, the 
government 
immediately informed the diplomatic authorities of the countries 
concerned, who proceeded to the scene of the incident. In 
agreement with these diplomatic authorities, the victims were 
given a proper burial. 
  Furthermore, aware of our country's reputation, the 
government decided today, 4 February, to rapidly set up a 
commission of inquiry.

  [Text] More than 60 illegal West African immigrants died on 
3 February in the cells of Rebouket Camp in Libreville. More 
than 220 West African nationals, including 158 Nigerians, 52 
Ghanaians, five Togolese, four Senegalese, four Malians, and 
some Beninese were arrested at the beginning of the week by the 
naval branch of the Gendarmerie as they attempted to enter Gabon 
illegally by sea. Held in temporary detention, 60 of them were 
discovered dead in the Rebouket Camp cells on 3 February. The 
government has been informed of the tragedy. What measures have 
the competent authorities taken? Let us listen to Lazare 
Digombe, minister of culture, arts, popular education and human 
rights, who was interviewed by Charles Mezo. 
  [Begin Digombe recording] We were informed that there had 
been a certain number of deaths at the regrouping center. 
According to the reports, when the cells were opened in the 
morning, a certain number of the immigrants were found dead. It 
is now left to explain how these deaths came about. In this 
center, which is not a prison with surveillance structures, you 
cannot imagine the gendarmes sleeping in the same place as 200 
people. It is unimaginable. We have even learned that one of 
the gendarmes who carried water to the immigrants was taken 
hostage by them and had to be freed. If you were a gendarme, I 
do not think you would accept to spend the night with such 
people. That is what you must understand. It is not a prison 
with surveillance structures. It is a center where the 
immigrants who just happened to turn up unexpectedly were 
fortuitously regrouped. We are talking here of illegal 
immigrants. 
  Now that we have learned that a large number of people have 
died, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of 
Communication, the Ministry of National Defense, and the 
Ministry of Human Rights have been informed. How do we explain 
the deaths? I told you yesterday, in my address to the nation, 
in a press communique on behalf of the government, that an 
enquiry has been ordered to determine the causes of these 
deaths. None of us was there to see how they died. However some 
assumptions have been put forward. Perhaps, a fight broke out 
among them. [end recording]

  [Text] Security forces have once again arrested around 130 
illegal aliens who were trying to disembark in Libreville, the 
capital. They are part of an inexplicable wave of illegal 
aliens arriving in the country over the past few days. At the 
other end of the harbor quay there are currently stranded more 
than 300 illegal aliens, including 264 Nigerians, 25 Ghanaians, 
four Senegalese, four Malians, and one Guinean. This was 
learned from Antoine Nzambonga, communications adviser at the 
Ministry of National Defense, this morning.

  [Text] Kinshasa, 3 Feb (PANA) -- The Bank of Zaire's 
counters have been closed to the public since 31 January due to 
a shortage of banknotes in its vaults, PANA learned from sources 
close to the issuing bank. 
  This cash shortage at the central bank is occurring three 
months after the monetary reform that was introduced on 22 
October by the outgoing government of Faustin Birindwa and that 
was aimed resolving liquidity problems. The commercial banks 
have been operating with closed counters and have only been 
attending to the affairs of business customers, a bank source 
disclosed to PANA. The same source also confirmed that there is 
an increase in check-cash exchange operations, with the current 
exchange rate standing at one zaire for a check of three zaires 
-- which was the practice before the introduction of the 
monetary reform. Statistics from the Bank of Zaire reveal that 
cash issuances amounted to 13,867,437 billion zaires at the end 
of December 1993, while deposit money [words indistinct] billion 
zaires during the same period -- $1 equals 100 new zaires [NZ]. 
  All the measures announced to support the monetary reforms 
have ended up being invalidated, financial sources interviewed 
by PANA in Kinshasa say. Yet, on 24 October--two days after the 
reform--Bank of Zaire Governor Buhendwa Bwa Mushaba, who was 
fired on 1 February, told a news conference that the central 
bank should no longer give concessionary facilities to the 
government and that the ceiling for covering government 
expenditure should not be exceeded. This challenge could not be 
met by the central bank, where 98 percent of banknotes issued 
went into state expenditure and only 2 percent were used for 
investment and economic revival. 
  According to a central bank expert, the financing of the 
state budget deficit through the banking system amounted to 
9,203,867 old zaires for the whole of 1993. For the first week 
of January 1994, the financing of the budget deficit amounted to 
NZ471.4 million and all funds disbursed for government economic 
activities were limited to 644,588 billion old zaires. 
  During the launching of the reform, the central bank 
authorities had planned to freeze 98 percent of checking 
deposits within the banking system, which should have made it 
possible to determine the money supply that is compatible with 
the real need of the economy. According to the same expert, 
"this important measure was scuttled in favor of hoarding and 
financing chance black market activities. Today, while the 
bank's coffers are empty, huge quantities of banknotes are 
circulating freely in the hands of informal sector speculators, 
who apparently do not have any problems." This situation has 
not enabled the central bank to mobilize foreign exchange 
resources to support the new national currency and meet external 
commitments, especially the importation of new currency symbols 
and the payment of the country's foreign debt service. 
  The foreign exchange earnings registered by the national 
bank 
after the reform are very low, a study published in the NOTE 
CONJONCTURE journal indicates. It reveals that they amounted to 
$3.6 in October, $2.4 in November, and $4 million in December 
1993. However, this institution owes local businesses $20 
million, the German currency printing firm Giesecke and Devrient 
$45 million, and $21.431 million to an import-export company 
that prints, transports, purchases, and conveys molds and 
numbering machines to Zaire, bank sources reveal.

  [Summary From Poor Reception] "The subprefect of Boukoumbe 
was kidnapped yesterday. In this connection, the Ministry of 
Interior, Security, and Territorial Administration has issued 
the following statement: There has been another criminal act in 
the Atakora Region. The subprefect of Boukoumbe, Mr. (Francis 
Hessou Tomlimeli) was kidnapped yesterday near [name indistinct] 
27 km from Boukoumbe." The minister of interior, security, and 
territorial administration is trying to find those responsible 
for this act. In a statement issued this morning he said this 
criminal act was the work of some armed bandits. "These armed 
bandits supposedly belong to a gang of former torturers of the 
Beninese people. According to the statement, this kidnapping 
demonstrates clearly that the antidemocratic forces have not 
disarmed yet. This is a very serious criminal act which the 
Beninese people and government condemn strongly because they 
want peace, tolerance, and security which are necessary for the 
country's economic revival and the consolidation of the 
democratic process embarked upon since the national conference 
of the active forces. The Beninese Government warns seriously 
the perpetrators of this sordid act as well as their accomplices 
both within and outside the country and who are supporting and 
assisting them against the consequences of their action and it 
holds them responsible for the life and safety of the Boukoumbe 
subprefect. The Beninese Government, therefore, demands the 
immediate and unconditional release of the subprefect. In any 
case, the statement went on, the Beninese Government is 
determined to fight banditry in all its forms and it will take 
necessary measures to annihilate these bandits who have 
deliberately chosen to go against the desire of our people."

  [Text] Joao da Costa has been cleared of charges [of 
plotting an attempted coup]. The opposition candidate to 
Guinea-Bissau's presidential elections has just been cleared of 
charges at Guinea-Bissau's Supreme Military Court. After the 
verdict was pronounced the first thing Joao da Costa did was to 
talk to us: 
  [Da Costa] "There were 14 defendants on trial at the Supreme 
Military Court and only three of them were cleared of charges: 
Joao da Costa, Tarmo (Anawai), and Gil (Sanha)." 
  [Announcer] That was a relieved Joao da Costa. 
  [Da Costa] "Thank God. I have just witnessed one of the 
greatest injustices ever." 
  [Announcer] That was Joao da Costa talking to Luis Ferreira. 
The leader of Guinea-Bissau's PRD [Democratic Renewal Party] has 
no doubt that had there not been international pressure his 
conviction would have been certain: 
  [Da Costa] "That is the regime. Had it been anyone else but 
Joao da Costa, I am sure they would have also been convicted. 
It is all because I am Joao da Costa, one of the opposition 
leaders, and international pressure helped me in being cleared."

  [Text] Lisbon, 4 Feb (AFP) -- The first pluralist elections 
will probably take place in April or May in Guinean-Bissau if 
they do not take place on 27 March as planned because of the 
delay during the preliminary phase. Mr. Helder Proenca, member 
of the political bureau of the African Party For the 
Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde, the ruling party, 
reported this on 4 February in Lisbon. 
  Helder Proenca, who tackled issues relating to the ongoing 
electoral process in his country with Portuguese authorities, 
said that the possible delay in their preparation cannot justify 
the postponement of the election for the end of the year. 
  The Portuguese newspaper PUBLICO wrote on 4 February that 
the 
president of the Republic, Joao Bernardo Vieira, candidate in 
the presidential election, wishes to maintain the date of 27 
March despite the "technical imposssibility" of the organization 
of the election already recognized by the National Electoral 
Commission and in which all legalized political parties are 
represented. 
  Six candidates have already been registered but they have 
not 
officially presented their candidacy because the date of the 
census of voters has not yet been set, the daily said, recalling 
that only registered voters on electoral lists are eligible.

  [Text] Dakar, 5 Feb (AFP) -- New Malian Prime Minister 
Ibrahima Boubacar Keita appears to be the best possible 
compromise between President Alpha Oumar Konare's anxiety to 
"govern at the center" and the desire of the radical leaders of 
the Alliance for Democracy in Mali [ADEMA] to run the government 
as the majority party. 
  An authoritative source told AFP that "it is the best 
solution," adding that the appointment of Boubacar Keita, former 
minister of foreign affairs, "should cool tempers." The new 
prime minister offers certain guarantees to both camps -- the 
ADEMA big shots and President Alpha Konare -- which have been 
been flying at each other for several months now. The former 
camp wants a "powerful government" and the latter is criticized 
for its April 1993 choice of Prime Minister Abdoulaye Sekou Sow, 
who represented the civil society. 
  As a founding member of the executive committee, ADEMA's 
highest political organ, the 49-year-old Keita is a "man of the 
fold," as the party's radical wing was demanding. However, he 
is also a trusted aide of the head of state, and was the deputy 
director of his presidential campaign, and then his spokesman 
after the 1992 elections. 
  ADEMA's leaders who intend to "govern alone" will be 
reassured by the fact that Aboubacar Keita is a "politician." 
They will interpret his appointment as "a step by the president 
toward the party," an authoritative source in Dakar told AFP. 
Immediately after his appointment, Aboubacar Keita hurried to 
reappoint the government of his predecessor with the sole 
exception that Mrs. Sy Khadiatou Sow, member of ADEMA and 
currently governor of Bamako region, succeeded him as minister 
of foreign affairs. 
  This decision has been interpreted as a gesture made to 
reassure the other parties in government that Mali cannot 
entertain a new political crisis, less than two years after 
Alpha Konare's accession to power. Today, the leaders of the 
presidential group affirm that "basically, there was no reason" 
to ignite another ministerial reshuffle, three months after the 
previous one which was marked by the strengthening of the 
presence of radical members of ADEMA. 
  The abrupt departure of Abdoulaye Sekou Sow, who on 2 
February presented the fait accompli "because he felt abandoned 
by all," according to his aides, did not permit the president 
"to push his analysis further."

  [Text] Dakar, Feb 6 (AFP) -- Mali's new Prime Minister 
Ibrahim Boubacar Keita was facing a serious political crisis 
Sunday [6 February], just two days after being appointed, 
because of an unexpected withdrawal of two parties from the 
governing coalition. 
  The National Congress of Democratic Initiative (CNID) has 
not 
made public its reasons for the departure, announced Sunday by 
its ruling committee, but one faction has complained of the 
government's "unpopularity". 
  It had three cabinet ministers covering justice, mining, 
energy and water. [as received] 
  The Assembly for Democracy and Progress (RPD) pulled out its 
one minister, for youth and sport, complaining that it had not 
been consulted on the new list of government members. 
  The new premier, from the Alliance for Malian Democracy 
(ADEMA) of President Alpha Oumar Konare, had returned everyone 
to their former posts. 
  Both withdrawing parties had only joined the government last 
April. During the last few weeks the CNID had led a strong 
campaign against the former premier, Abdoulaye Sekou Sow, 
accusing him of not implementing the government programme and 
calling for a government of national unity. 
  The radical wing of ADEMA wants the party to govern on its 
own.

  [Text] The National Committee for Democratic Initiative 
[CNID] decided yesterday to put an end to its participation in 
the government without giving any reason, according to a 
statement issued by the Steering Committee of the party. The 
CNID was represented in the government by three ministers: 
Yoro Diakite, in charge of mines, energy and water resources; 
Amidou Diabate, minister of justice and keeper of the seals; and 
Abdoulaye Diop, in charge of construction, town planning and 
housing. 
  The Rally for Democracy and Progress, represented in the 
government by Mr. Ousmane Oumarou Sidibe, minister of 
employment, civil service, and labor, also resigned yesterday. 
  However, the two parties reaffirmed their readiness to help 
solve the country's problems. But for the time being, it is not 
known if the resignation of the two parties has been accepted by 
new Prime Minister Ibrahim Boubacar Keita.

  [Text] Following the decision by the National Committee for 
Democratic Initiative and the Rally for Democracy and Progress 
to withdraw from the government over the weekend, new Prime 
Minister Ibrahim Boubacar Keita reshuffled the cabinet last 
night. The list of the new Government of the Republic of Mali 
is as follows:

  [Text] Niamey, 4 Feb (AFP) -- Four movements of the Tuareg 
rebellion in Niger, meeting under the umbrella of the 
Coordination of the Armed Resistance (CRA), have agreed to 
resume dialogue with the government and set up an "executive 
bureau" presided over by Mano Dayak, a CRA communique points 
out. According to this communique published in Niamey today by 
the weekly LE REPUBLICAIN (close to the Tuareg community), the 
next meeting, the date for which was not specified, is expected 
to take place in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, the very place where 
a series of negotiations ended in failure last November. 
  In an interview with AFP, government spokesman Moctar Diallo 
confirmed the authorities' "readiness" in participating in such 
a meeting. He hoped that "facilitating" countries (France, 
Algeria, and Burkina Faso) would intervene again to help fix the 
date. 
  In its communique, the CRA stressed its willingness to once 
again "prove its good faith" but warned that it does not 
envisage "signing a new truce" during this meeting. It 
criticizes the Niger Government for "not being able to take 
advantage" of the truce observed from February 1993 to January 
this year "to create the necessary conditions for frank and 
sincere dialogue leading to peace." 
  In the opinion of the CRA, the Ouagadougou meeting "should 
allow for the designation of a mediating country, draw up a 
timetable and the places of meetings for possible political 
negotiations." The communique specifies that these decisions 
were made "at a meeting held from 25 January to 2 February in 
the Tenere" (desert of northern Niger) in the presence of 
leaders of the four movements -- Front for the Liberation of Air 
and Azaouak (FLAA); Revolutionary Army for the Liberation of 
Northern Niger (ARLN); Front for the Liberation of Tamoust 
(FLT), and the Patriotic Front for the Liberation of the Sahara 
(FPLS). 
  At the end of meeting, participants set up an executive 
bureau, the "supreme organ" of the resistance, composed of the 
following: president, Mano Dayak (FLT leader); vice presidents, 
Rissa Ag Boula (FLAA leader) and Mohammed Abdoulmoumine (ARLN 
leader); spokesman Aoutcheki Kriska; secretary general, Idil 
Ag-Ayaha; social affairs, Assadek Gagidan; and finance, Mohammed 
Ewanghe. 
  The Tuareg community of Niger is estimated at 750,000 -- 10 
percent of the country's population. Their rebellion, which was 
launched in November 1991, has left 99 persons dead, according 
to official toll.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Party politics may be banned in Nigeria and 
political statements critical of General Sani Abacha's regime 
outlawed, but apparently that doesn't stop Nigerians speaking 
out. With only days left for Nigerians to offer their ideas 
about the proposed national conference, two meetings -- one in 
Kaduna in the north, the other in Ibadan in the southwest -- 
have been far from mealy-mouthed in their offerings. From 
Lagos, Sola Odunfa reports: 
  [Begin Odunfa recording] The two meetings in Kaduna and 
Ibadan this week are part of the nationwide search for what has 
been described as a more equitable framework for national unity 
in the light of the crisis which followed the annulment of last 
year's presidential election. The two meetings reflect the 
widespread disenchantment with both the Babangida military 
regime and military rule generally. The Ibadan meeting is an 
ethnic gathering by traditional rulers and so-called leaders of 
thought in western Nigeria to draw up a Yoruba memorandum for 
the constitutional conference. The Yoruba leaders are still 
smarting under the annulment of the presidential election 
believed to have been won by Bashorun Moshood Abiola, a Yoruba 
man. They are therefore insisting that Nigeria's political 
problems could be solved only on the basis of that election. A 
report from Ibadan today said that the Yoruba leaders were also 
proposing that Nigeria be turned into a loose federation of 
eight powerful regions with a weakened central government which 
will be responsible mainly for foreign affairs and defense 
against external aggression. 
  On their own, the traditional rulers are requesting 
constitutional recognition of their status and the assignment to 
them of specific roles in national affairs. They said that they 
would submit their memorandum to the conference commission on 
Monday [7 February], three days to the closing date. 
  The Kaduna meeting, organized by the Ahmadu Bello 
University, 
is being attended by political leaders and academics drawn from 
all parts of Nigeria. The key speakers are former military 
rulers, General Olusegun Obasanjo and Muhammadu Buhari, both of 
whom pulled no punches in denouncing the regime of their former 
colleague, President Ibrahim Babangida for bringing Nigeria to 
its present prostrate political and economic situation. The 
meeting is considering, among other issues, Gen. Obasanjo's 
suggestion that Gen. Sani Abacha should announce a definite 
tenure for his government and that the decisions of the 
constitutional conference should be subject to approval only at 
a national referendum. [end recording]

  [Text] Lagos, Feb 6 (AFP) -- Illegal immigrants from 
neighbouring states have flocked into northeastern Nigeria since 
the devaluation of the CFA franc on January 11, the NEWS AGENCY 
OF NIGERIA (NAN) reported Sunday [6 February]. The agency said 
the immigrants have invaded Yola, capital of Adamawa state 
following the devaluation, which was accompanied by the pegging 
of the Nigerian currency at 22 naira to the dollar. 
  The Nigerian government decision to peg the currency against 
the dollar, announced at the same time as the 1994 budget, 
enhanced the value of the naira against the CFA franc, said NAN. 
Before the government decision, 1,000 CFA francs could buy 140 
naira on the black market. Now they could only buy 65 naira. 
  NAN said the immigrants were mostly from neighbouring 
Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Mali, and mainly old men with wives 
and children. It gave no figure for how many people were 
involved. 
  The head of immigration in the state, Aliyu Abdullahi, told 
NAN that some of the aliens were also from Algeria and 
war-afflicted Sudan. 
  NAN said the male immigrants had sought employment in 
low-paid work such as the construction industry, or as gatemen, 
nightwatchmen. Women are trying to work as hairdressers.

<F P=106> [Address to the nation by President Gnassingbe Eyadema; </F>
place and date not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] Togolese, the parliamentary election campaign has 
ended. You will vote tomorrow in a sovereign manner as free and 
responsible citizens. I noticed that the Fourth Republic's 
first parliamentary election campaign took place peacefully; 
freedom of speech for all was respected. This is proof of your 
political maturity. Everyone was able to express himself fully 
and was granted the same access to the state media. Few 
countries in the world can boast of showing such a high degree 
of democratic principle. I wish to thank all those who assisted 
in organizing elections -- the International Monitoring 
Committee; foreign countries which sent us experts and election 
material; the National Electoral Commission, which worked with 
all the political forces through consensus; the government and 
the administration which worked relentlessly so that everything 
will be ready on time; and the Supreme Court, which is carrying 
out its constitutional mission by respecting people's rights. I 
must not fail to thank all those citizens who helped in issuing 
and distributing voter cards. Their action is even more worthy 
considering the fact that violence caused by people from outside 
tried to destabilize our country once again; it caused death and 
desolation in our capital and its surroundings. 
  The choice you are about to make is a decisive one for our 
country. I will respect whichever choice you make in accordance 
with the democratic law established by our Constitution. I am 
pleased that the elections will be held in the presence of 
several international observers. We are happy to welcome them. 
We also thank them for the selfless contribution they have been 
making to our democratic development. Our democracy is 
transparent so they are free to carry out their important 
mission the way they wish. On the eve of the elections, I wish 
to remind you of certain basic principles in my capacity as head 
of state and guarantor of national unity. I will direct all my 
energy to ensuring that democratic regulations, which require 
everyone to respect the Constitution, are followed. 
  After this long transitional period, our country needs 
stability and order. One cannot call for democracy and resort 
to violence at the same time. Similarly, one cannot call for 
respect for the law of the ballot boxes and incite people to 
rebellion at the same time. As a head of state, elected through 
universal suffrage for a five-year term of office, I will assume 
my high mission by serving you. My duty is to enable our 
country to resume its march forward on a sound footing with the 
contribution of the new assembly to be elected. I hope that 
your choice will enable our dear Togo to recover political 
stability without which nothing good can be undertaken. There 
is no magic solution to our problems. We have the solution, you 
have the solution, and it demands that each of us should get 
back to work and that the people's interests prevail over those 
of the political class. I hope that while voting freely and 
sovereignly, you will keep in mind these two periods: the 24 and 
1/2 years that we spend together and the three years of 
transition that we are currently going through. At the end of 
this transition, do not fail to support all those who are ready 
to help our country set back to work. 
  Democracy is not anarchy, laxity, or confiscation of the 
people's will. Democracy is discipline and the desire to serve 
the people. It is also self-denial and mutual respect. In 
democracy each citizen can express his preferences, but a 
multiparty system must not make people forget the national 
interest. Tomorrow's poll should enable people to express our 
different leanings, but in the absolute respect for our unity as 
well as ethnic and geographic peculiarities. There may be among 
us different leanings, but there is only one people. I hope 
that each Togolese will remember this before going to the poll. 
After the elections, my main concern will be to strive for 
reconciliation among all the sons of our people and to enable 
each of us to participate in the activities of national life. 
Before concluding, I should not forget to stress that an 
election is also a peaceful competition. 
  I would like to wish each of the candidates good luck, and 
may the best win. To you fellow countrymen and women, I wish 
that you choose the candidates that you will deem the best. I 
call on you to eagerly go the polls and do this in a calm 
atmosphere as well as in discipline so that in the days ahead 
our country can proudly recover all its lost positions in the 
comity of nations. 
  Long live Togo! Long live the Republic! Long live democracy!

  [Text] The 1.9 million voters duly registered on the 
electoral register were called to the polls today for the first 
round of the legislative elections in 4,639 polling stations 
spread throughout the country. Following the withdrawal of five 
comrades, 352 candidates are vying for 81 seats in the National 
Assembly. The stakes in this legislative election are high. It 
is to provide our Constitution, which was overwhelmingly 
approved on 27 September and promulgated on 14 October 1992 by 
the president of the Republic, with an important organ which is 
the National Assembly. The presidential group is hoping to get 
a majority of seats in parliament to consolidate the executive's 
power base, while the goal of the opposition is to win the 
legislative elections and therefore be able to choose a prime 
minister from their ranks. 
  French and Burkinabe civilian and military observers sent 
throughout the country are seeing to the smooth running of the 
polls. Hundreds of foreign personalities, who are experienced 
observers, went to several polling stations in Lome and the 
provinces to ascertain the regularity of the polls. Security is 
ensured near the polling stations by members of the Operation 
Reconciliation-Security 93 Force. Polling stations were closed 
at 1800 for the cities in the provinces while they were closed 
at 1900 in Lome, the capital. The Ministry of Territorial 
Administration and Security announces that polling stations have 
been closed since 1800 throughout the country. 
  On the whole, the elections took place in calm without any 
incidents reported. President Eyadema, who insisted on going to 
Yamoussoukro to participate in the last tribute to Ivorian 
President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, could not go to the polling 
station in Pya, his hometown where he is registered to vote, 
because of his tight schedule. He therefore voted by proxy in 
his hometown because the provisions of the electoral code do not 
allow him to vote in Lome where he is not registered on any 
voters list.

  [Excerpt] Lome, 7 Feb (AFP) -- A leading Togolese 
opposition politician, Edem Kodjo, criticised vote-counting 
procedures Sunday [6 February] after polling stations had closed 
in the first round of parliamentary elections here. "The count 
must be done correctly. That is where there is the most trouble. 
And my first impressions have not been good," said Kodjo, head 
of the Togolese Democratic Union. He charged that candidates 
were having trouble obtaining copies of official reports from 
polling station officials, as was their right under the 
electoral code. 
  Shortly after his complaint national radio broadcast a 
statement calling for electoral rules to be respected. 
Burkinabe Minister of State Herman Yameogo, head of an 
international monitoring committee grouping representatives from 
Burkina Fasso, Egypt, France, Germany and the United States, 
minimized the problems, attributing them to poorly informed 
polling officials. Earlier Sunday Kodjo said he had been 
"satisfied" with the way the elections had been run. 
  The results of the first round -- in which two million 
voters 
were eligible to take part -- are due to be released on 
Wednesday, with a run-off poll scheduled for February 20.

  [Excerpt] Voting was calm in the first round of 
parliamentary elections in Togo yesterday. Counting is still 
going on. The television stayed on air throughout the night, but 
as yet there are very few results, with the exception of two 
constituencies in Lome, two out of 81. Guy Mariot: 
  [Mariot] Based on these results, the opposition is leading, 
with Edem Kodjo's Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD] and the 
Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] of Yao Agboyibor. In the 
first constituency of the commune of Lome, where there were 
seven candidates, the CAR candidate is leading with 2,654 votes, 
followed by that of the UTD, with 2,547, and Savi de Tove of the 
PDU [Party of Democrats for Unity] with 1,708 out of 8,187 
votes. In the north of the country, in the first constituency 
of [word indistinct], the candidate of the UTD is first, with 
3,406 votes, followed by the CAR with 1,099 and the Rally of the 
Togolese People [RPT], President Eyadema's party, with 1,056 out 
of (7,150) votes cast. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Lome, 7 Feb (AFP) -- The first provisional 
results in Togo's general elections were released Monday [7 
February], giving two seats to the ruling party and three to the 
opposition out of a total of 81. Turnout appeared to be high 
among the country's two million voters in Sunday's first round 
of voting, ranging from 47 to 79 percent. 
  The Assembly of the Togolese People (RPT) of President 
Gnassingbe Eyadema, who has ruled Togo since 1967, won seats in 
Bassar and Tone with 72 and 73 percent support respectively. 
  Candidates from the opposition Togolese Union for Democracy 
(UTD), led by Edem Kodjo, led the first round in Danyi and Oti 
with 43 and 49 percent, and the Committee for Action on Renewal 
(CAR), led by Yao Agboyibo, carried a seat in Lome with 34 
percent. 
  Final results are due to be released by Wednesday, with a 
run-off poll scheduled for February 20. The National Electoral 
Commission admitted that "technical difficulties" were causing 
delays. 
  Voter turnout was higher than in a presidential vote last 
August which all the opposition parties boycotted. This time 
only one radical group, the Union of Forces for Change (UFC), 
refused to participate. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Two emissaries from the Beninese Government 
arrived in Lome this morning. They are Desire Vieyra, minister 
of state in charge of national defense, and Alabi Antoine 
Gbegan, minister of interior, public security, and territorial 
administration. The delegation was welcomed at the Benin-Togo 
Hila Kondji border by Combevi Georges Agbodjan, minister of 
territorial administration and security, in the presence of the 
permanent undersecretary to the president of the Republic, and 
Colonel (Sezin Walla), commander of the National Gendarmerie. 
  Soon after arriving in our capital the delegation was 
received in audience by General Gnassingbe Eyadema in Lome, Ward 
2. After the audience, Mr. Vieyra, leader of the delegation, 
told newsmen that he was dispatched by Beninese President 
Nicephore Soglo to meet his Togolese counterpart for discussions 
on security problems between the two states, particularly the 
kidnapping of a Beninese subprefect by an armed gang. According 
to the Beninese Government, the kidnappers and the hostage took 
refuge in Togo. Let us listen to Mr. Vieyra: 
  [Begin recording] [Vieyra] President Nicephore Soglo 
dispatched me to his friend and brother, President Gnassingbe 
Eyadema, to first discuss problems concerning our two countries, 
mainly security problems. As you know, there was an incident on 
our territory recently. An armed gang which, we think, was led 
by a fugitive soldier, kidnapped a subprefect and is holding him 
hostage. According to the information we have, we believe that 
they took refuge in Togolese territory. We have therefore been 
dispatched by President Nicephore Soglo to seek President 
Eyadema's assistance so that those bandits can be quickly found 
and the subprefect in question can be handed over safely to the 
Beninese authorities. 
  We found in Gen. Eyadema all the necessary support, 
understanding, and availability that we were expecting of him, 
and we are returning confident that searches will continue and 
the matter will be settled. This affair should not be an 
obstacle to the friendly and fraternal relations that have 
always existed between Benin and Togo. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Is it confirmed that the kidnappers 
and the subprefect are on Togolese territory? 
  [Vieyra] In such cases, nobody can confirm anything, but 
according to our information we know that they crossed the 
Togolese border. Are they still on Togolese territory? We are 
not in a position to confirm that. [passage omitted] [end

<F P=106> [Interview with Lansana Kouyate, the deputy UN secretary </F>
general's special representative in Mogadishu, by correspondent 
Assane Diop; place and date not given--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] The deputy UN secretary general's special 
representative in Mogadishu, Lansana Kouyate, is the guest of 
RFI this evening [passage omitted]. How is the latest UN 
resolution being greeted in Mogadishu? 
  [Kouyate] The resolution adopted by the UN Security Council 
is the one needed by Somalia today because it is absolutely 
necessary to put things in perspective. The international 
community is unable to impose peace on a population that will 
reject it. This is the sine qua non condition for this peace to 
be workable. The Somalis must take their fate in their own 
hands. I believe that this concept has been understood by the 
Security Council. 
  [Diop] So the issue of the disarming will recede into the 
background; you are saying that the international community 
cannot impose peace if the Somalis do not want it while, in 
fact, those who are blocking peace, or rather the one who is 
blocking peace now is mainly General Aidid. 
  [Kouyate] Yes, certainly. Now all Somalis must be invited to 
sit down together, and this is where the diplomatic and 
political roles will be underlined. They must patiently be made 
to understand that they have to sit around the same table. I 
believe that the incident with the Somali National Alliance was 
unfortunate, firstly, because it did not happen in the framework 
of a national disarmament plan, and also because it was focussed 
too much on Mogadishu, this gave the impression of a war against 
one man only, against one faction only. I believe that this 
needs correcting first. 
  [Diop] The United Nations is still considering this 
roundtable between all Somalis, including General Aidid. For 
his part, General Aidid, who keeps playing the spoilsport, is 
considering turning against the United Nations once the Western 
contingents have left. Aren't we moving toward a dead end with 
this man? 
  [Kouyate] There are rumors that the situation will get 
worse. 
I believe that, politically, we must cool things down, that the 
Somalis must know that their fate will not be decided before 30 
March, but also after it, and that it is in their hands. 
Therefore, all the threats emanating from the Somali National 
Alliance may be groundless. One should not add fuel to the 
flames now, one should tread carefully. That being said, it is 
true that General Aidid refuses to get in touch with the United 
Nations today; however in Somalia, as elsewhere, changes occur 
all the time. 
  I believe that the Security Council's reassessment of 
options 
for Somalia and the reinsertion of these in the framework of 
diplomatic and political action is also an asset. General 
Aidid, who was being hunted, is now free to move; the Somali 
National Alliance prisoners held by UNOSOM [UN Operation in 
Somalia] have been freed, and this new resolution is stressing 
the diplomatic and political approach. These are real assets. 
The United Nations is also making a huge effort to set up 
police forces. We have already received all the necessary 
equipment, uniforms, weapons, vehicles. I believe that we are 
doing tremendous work there. I believe that those who are 
opposing this will be [words indistinct] Somali forces but not 
the United Nations.

  [Excerpt] Mohamed Farah Aidid, chairman of the Somali 
National Alliance [SNA] and the United Somali Congress [USC], 
met a U.S. delegation in Nairobi recently led by Robert Oakley, 
U.S. special envoy to Somalia. The two sides discussed many 
issues affecting the situation in Somalia and how to find a just 
solution to them. 
  Speaking on the occasion, Mohamed Farah Aidid referred to 
the 
problems brought upon the Somali people by the UN Operation in 
Somalia [UNOSOM]. He said there is a need to create another 
agency which will perform humanitarian work, given the fact that 
UNOSOM-II has lost the Somali people's confidence. Chairman 
Aidid added that fighting would not break out in Somalia when 
the foreign troops leave. He stressed that all the foreign 
troops should withdraw from Somalia since they are not required 
at the moment. 
  Speaking on the reconciliation efforts, Aidid said the SNA 
is 
still having talks and consultations with other parties in light 
of the failed consultations in Addis Ababa. He said the Addis 
Ababa consultation meeting collapsed because of UNOSOM-II, 
foreign interference, and because of a few individuals serving 
their colonial masters. 
  On the subject of peace, the chairman said the American 
troops have deliberately massacred 78 Somalis since the 
cease-fire was declared. The chairman warned the foreign troops 
concerning the continued massacres and violation of the 
cease-fire. 
  Robert Oakley spoke about the importance for the Somali 
people of working for peace among themselves and embarking on 
the reconstruction of the country. He made it clear that 
UNOSOM-II's responsibility is to assist the Somali people, 
adding that his government will not give preferential support to 
one region of the country over another when it comes to 
reconstruction and development. Mr. Oakley said that America 
will provide millions of dollars for the country's 
reconstruction and rehabilitation if a stable political 
situation is reached. 
  The talks took place in an atmosphere of understanding.

  [Text] Mohamed Farah Aidid, the chairman of the Somali 
National Alliance [SNA], who is also the chairman of the United 
Somali Congress [USC] has, at his hotel residence in Nairobi, 
met some officials of the recently formed Somali Aid 
Coordination Body, SACB. 
  At the meeting, the chairman first thanked the vital 
decision 
they had made to oversee relief aid distribution and 
rehabilitation of the country, adding that he was happy that 
donor countries and agencies had decided to manage relief aid 
for the Somali people themselves, as this was what had been 
called for all along. He went on to say that no assistance had 
reached the affected Somali people ever since UN Operation in 
Somalia [UNOSOM] took over the responsibility of managing relief 
work, and the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Somalia. 
Moreover, not a single project had been undertaken in the 
country to benefit the people, although the international 
community had provided Somalia with a large amount of funds. 
  Aidid told heads of the new body to make new assessments of 
the needs of the country's regions and then to ensure equitable 
distribution of relief aid and reconstruction of the regions. 
He stated that there were some regions which had not received 
any assistance because of UNOSOM's decision to (?sideline) them. 
The chairman described as baseless lies that there was 
insecurity in those regions, adding that security in those 
regions was maintained more than in any other region. Aidid 
appealed to the SACB to give higher priority to basic social 
services such as water supplies, health, education, and 
electricity. 
  He said there were many cripples and insane people as a 
result of the war who needed health care. Speaking on 
development, Chairman Aidid said Somalia had natural resources 
that could benefit the Somali people, such as livestock, 
agriculture and minerals, and he added that Somalia had 3,800-km 
of coastline with inestimable resources. He called on the body 
to help exploit these resources. 
  In particular, he requested the enlargement and 
rehabilitation of the Somali police force, wherever it might be 
in the country, describing it as the best police force on the 
African continent. 
  On the Somali refugees, he said there was a need to 
repatriate and resettle them in their mother country. He said 
the returnees should be cared for until they became 
self-supporting. He said the UNHCR should consult with the 
Somali political organizations, relief agencies, and other 
concerned countries on the repatriation program. 
  General Aidid pledged to the SACB that the SNA would 
guarantee the security of aid workers, adding that full 
cooperation and a good working relationship between the SNA and 
aid personnel would be established. The chairman disclosed that 
the SNA had charged the various committees existing in the 
regions, districts and villages with the responsibility of 
working with the new aid body. He informed the new body that 
there were many highly skilled and educated Somalis in the 
country and he therefore requested the new body to give them 
jobs as these people were unemployed because of UNOSOM's 
preference for expatriates. 
  On reconciliation, Aidid told the officials of the new body 
that political consultations between the Somali organizations 
were going on. He said though it could not be said that 
breakthroughs had been achieved, political gaps had been 
narrowed and soon it was expected that most of the organizations 
would adopt a common political stand. 
  For their part, the SACB officials expressed their thanks 
and 
happiness and satisfaction with the chairman's comments, 
suggestions and the detailed speech. They said that as 
representatives of the countries which contributed aid they 
would directly and properly manage any assistance for Somalia. 
They said that they had long ago requested the UN general 
secretary to hand over responsibility for relief coordination 
and development of the country to the UN Development Program 
from UNOSOM. 
  They said a new era of cooperation between the Somali people 
and donor countries had begun and stressed that they would work 
with genuine leaders and representatives of the Somali people. 
They said their work was purely humanitarian and the task of 
finding a just political solution to the country's problems was 
for the Somali people. The officials promised that the SACB 
would very soon start work throughout the country's regions, 
adding that there would be no practice of preferring one region 
to another, as every bona fide region or person was entitled to 
international assistance. Finally, they appealed to the SNA and 
USC chairman to ensure the security of aid workers and establish 
cooperation and a working relationship. The meeting took place 
in an atmosphere of understanding and success.

  [Excerpts] The vice president, Dr. Samson Kisekka, has left 
for the Ivory Coast [Cote d'Ivoire] capital, Abidjan, to 
represent President Yoweri Museveni at the funeral of President 
Felix Houphouet-Boigny, who died in France last year. [passage 
omitted] 
  On his way to Abidjan, the vice president stopped over at 
Nairobi airport, where he talked to the press. Answering a 
question, Dr. Kisekka said African (?strife) originates from the 
politics of hatred, which he attributed mainly to ignorance. He 
stressed the need for vigorous sensitization of our people to 
stop this. He said it is important to cultivate a culture of 
self-reliance to overcome indebtedness and other developmental 
problems. 
  On the revival of the East African Community, he said Uganda 
welcomes the move, realizing the need for a collective economic 
force in the region. Regretting the collapse of the East 
African Community in 1977, he pointed out Uganda's historic 
brotherly ties with Kenya, which witnessed many Kenyans studying 
in Uganda's educational institutions and cooperation in other 
fields. 
  On instability characterizing some countries in Africa, he 
said Uganda had made contributions to the resolution of 
conflicts and to date it has dispatched more than 700 troops to 
Liberia on a peacekeeping mission. 
  On the situation at home, he outlined the government's 
programs which have facilitated a lot of change in the chaos 
before. He said the country is now preparing for Constituent 
Assembly elections which will result in the making of a new 
constitution to form the basis of governance. He said that the 
government is deliberately encouraging leadership by example, 
which has resulted in considerable success in some areas.

<F P=106> [Address by President Yoweri Museveni on the 13th </F>
anniversary of the National Resistance Army formation at Lubiri 
parade grounds in Kampala on 6 February--live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The National Resistance Army 
[NRA] must always be conscious that they are now the principal 
weapon of the people of Uganda. Therefore, when they are given 
an assignment, they should ensure that they do it well and 
retain the respect of the population. 
  And that brings me to corruption within the Army. There has 
been corruption in parts of the Army, quite widespread 
corruption. You remember the other time I had to abolish the 
giving of food because it had become a source of corruption for 
those who were handling food and I had to order the giving of 
money directly to the soldier so the soldier can buy his own 
food instead of having food centrally bought. When I wrested 
the food money out of the hands of those who were misusing it 
then they looked for new ways of how to steal -- fuel, I don't 
know what, tires, even these salaries, they resurrect dead 
soldiers, put them on the pay sheet and so on. The Army 
leadership has been directed by the Army Council and by myself 
to fight corruption, to continue to fight corruption. 
  And you, the ordinary soldiers, should always expose 
corruption in your meetings; in battalion meetings, you should 
expose corruption. Don't fear, there is nothing the thieves can 
do to you, especially if you shout loudly and you are heard. We 
are here to defend you. But if you keep quiet, then they steal 
things there, we won't know. We shall not know. But of course 
the leadership of the Army must also be active in inspection. 
They must inspect regionally so that we catch those who are 
stealing. So there must be a double movement. Inspections from 
the top and exposure from below. 
  The exercise of reduction in force has gone ahead well. Last 
year we reduced the force by 23,000 men. We are now going to 
reduce another 10,000. Now, this will leave, as the army 
commander was saying, a smaller army, but better equipped. An 
army is not human beings alone. In modern warfare if you send 
human beings only in war, they will be [words indistinct]. They 
need equipment, full equipment. We don't want ultra-modern 
equipment. We can't afford it. But, fortunately, the likely 
enemies we have in Africa also don't have ultra-modern 
equipment. But we need modest equipment to guard our frontiers 
and I am pleased to say that since the reduction in the force, 
we have liberated money, we have saved money which we have used 
to upgrade the equipment of the Army. The Army now is better 
equipped than it was last year and we shall continue to upgrade 
the equipment. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Bank of Uganda has confirmed press reports that 
it will issue a new currency note in the denomination of 5,000 
shillings on 14th February. 
  In a press release at the beginning of this week, the 
governor of the Bank of Uganda, Mr. Charles Kikonyogo stressed 
that the introduction of the new currency note does not mean a 
currency change. The new note, he said, will circulate side by 
side with other notes currently in use. He added that the new 
note will reach everybody in the country through the banking 
system. The relevant posters will soon be on display at banks, 
post offices and district administration offices.

  [Text] In a vain attempt to take Cuito, Jonas Savimbi's 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] 
continues to mercilessly shell civilians. Late this afternoon, 
our team counted more than 30 killed and 49 wounded, mostly 
children, elderly men, and women, always the most vulnerable 
layers of society. Despite (?heavy) clashes, government troops 
have been scoring major victories against the enemy. By 
yesterday, UNITA positions had been retaken by the Angolan Armed 
Forces [FAA), the National Police, and the Civil Defense. 
Government forces, who have sworn to avenge the death of their 
commander, the ill-fated Lieutenant General Alfredo Kussumue, 
and to flush out the bandits in the service of Jonas Savimbi, 
are determined to fight to the last man. 
  In operations carried out today, government forces captured 
an Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] lieutenant 
and assorted war materiel. As we file this report, UNITA rebel 
forces are using 106-mm guns, B-12, and 130-mm guns, as well as 
60-mm and 81-mm mortars to decimate Cuito residents and reduce 
the city to ashes.

  [Excerpt] The situation in Angola is not improving, and 
despite peace talks in Lusaka, the government and National Union 
for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] forces continue 
fighting on the ground. The province of Bie is under fire, and 
UNITA admitted moments ago that Bie is already under the control 
of government troops. There are reports that as many as 30-50 
people have been killed in today's clashes. More details from 
Paulo Juliao: 
  [Juliao] The city of Cuito, capital of Bie Province, has 
been 
again under intense shelling since 0745 hours. At the moment, 
the clashes between the government and UNITA forces are 
spreading all over Cuito. More than 30 civilians have been 
killed, and another 49 have been injured. The Luanda forces 
reported they have taken over most of the positions previously 
held by UNITA troops and have captured four UNITA soldiers, 
including an officer. The two armies have been using long-range 
artillery in the battle over control of Cuito, including 106 mm 
and 130 mm mortars and P-12 cannons. 
  In the meantime, the two armies continue to exchange 
accusations about who has violated the cease-fire, which was 
broken this morning in Cuito. Reports from that city tell us 
that the government forces had sworn to expel Savimbi's men from 
the city, thus paying homage to their deceased commander Kosuma.

  [Text] Progress made at the talks in Lusaka, where the 
government and the National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] have reached agreement on two out of the five 
points in the negotiating agenda is not yet enough to cause the 
Angolan people to believe that Jonas Savimbi's organization is 
about to renounce its warmongering stance. In Cuito, capital of 
Bie Province, UNITA troops yesterday resumed attacks on 
government forces to conquer the city in order to influence the 
talks tomorrow in the Zambian capital. 
  Reports from Cuito say that UNITA has once again used 
everything at its disposal to take over the city. To achieve 
its aims it is indifferent to the fact that its actions cause 
more innocent victims. Dozens of bodies are already spread out 
on the roads of the martyred and destroyed city of Cuito. Our 
correspondent Abel Abreu reports from the area: 
  [Begin Abreu recording] A total of 48 people were killed and 
62 others wounded, mostly children, the elderly, and women in a 
number of houses which became [word indistinct] is the 
preliminary figure of the shellings by UNITA since yesterday in 
the martyred city of Cuito. Cuito is once again dressed in 
black. The capital city of the province [word indistinct] is 
characterized by blood, powder, and mourning. The number of 
shells launched by UNITA against the afflicted Cuito residents 
is estimated at more than 4,000. The smile, which was beginning 
to show on the lips of thousands of people who survived the 
recent nine-month war, was abruptly extinguished yesterday with 
the renewed sound of 120, (B30, 106), B12 cannons [words 
indistinct], and 60-mm and 81-mm mortars from UNITA. 
  The Angolan Armed Forces [FAA], the National Police, and the 
civilian defense caused considerable losses to the enemy, 
killing 47 UNITA bandits and capturing assorted war materiel. 
The great victory scored by the government forces is not 
limited to the killing of UNITA soldiers and the capture of war 
materiel. The FAA, the National Police, and the civilian 
defense went further and were able to take over more than 85 
percent of the city. They also occupied some outlying wards -- 
namely, Camacuto, Pinguita, Guija, and Gabreio, areas which 
until yesterday were under UNITA control. 
  In an exclusive interview with our reporters, [name 
indistinct] 2d commander of FAA in Bie, said his troops are more 
than ever prepared to teach the enemy a lesson and finish them 
off. He said, quote, the story of Huambo, Uige, and Soyo will 
not be repeated here in Cuito. If UNITA hopes to take over 
Cuito because of victories scored in those areas, it is 
deceiving itself, for we swear to defend Cuito to the last, and 
we are fulfilling the legacy of the deceased Lieutenant General 
Alfredo Cutumbua, unquote. The clashes continue, but everything 
is under the control of government soldiers. [end recording]

  [Text] There is violent fighting going on in the Cuito area 
of Angola. The latest reports tell us that more than 100 people 
have been killed and more than 200 have been injured. We have 
been informed that, despite that, UNITA [National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola] will continue the negotiations in 
Lusaka. On the other hand, the Angolan Government admitted it 
is engaging in a major military offensive action in northern 
Angola: 
  [Correspondent Mendes Oliveira] Heavy shelling continued 
this 
morning in the city of Cuito. According to the Angolan national 
radio correspondent in that city, the number of people who have 
died since the fighting resumed on Saturday [5 February] is now 
over 100. The government forces stated yesterday evening that 
they controlled 85 percent of the city, which had been under 
UNITA control for five months. 
  The UNITA leadership held an emergency meeting and decided 
that, despite the fighting, it will continue to be present at 
the talks in Lusaka and respect the unilateral cease-fire it 
declared in September. Despite justifying the attack on the 
grounds of maneuvers by the UNITA forces in Cuito, military 
sources in Luanda have admitted that the Angolan Armed Forces 
are engaged in a major offensive action all over northern 
Angola. They stated that they have recaptured the city of 
Ambriz and that they are engaged in the attempt to recapture the 
oil city of Soyo and city of N'dalatando, the capital of Cuanza 
Norte province. 
  Despite this recent escalation, the two delegations will 
today resume talks in Lusaka. The presence in Lusaka of the 
head of the UNAVEM [United Nations Angola Verification Mission] 
military mission has been used as an excuse for them to start 
discussion on the mandate of the UN mission and the role of the 
observers, leaving behind, unfinished, the difficult issue of 
national reconcilliation. 
  UNITA Spokesman Jorge Valentim yesterday defended the 
lifting 
of sanctions which prevent the sale of weapons and fuel to 
UNITA. Valentim stated that in allowing one of the sides to be 
over-armed and engage in an ethnic cleasing policy, the 
international community is allowing the creation of new Bosnias 
in UNITA-controlled areas.

  [Excerpt] The Lusaka peace talks may be under way, but the 
Marxist, Leninist, and communist Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] government in Luanda 
continues to prefer killing civilians. At about 0800 [0700 GMT] 
this morning, three MPLA-PT air force combat fighters flew in 
from Catumbela air base and destroyed a number of residential 
areas in the much martyred city of Huambo. A number of 
children, women, and old people were killed. 
  [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] A parachute 
system was used to guide the fragmentation and (?precision) 
bombs dropped over the city. Those bombs made countless 
civilians victims and destroyed the homes of peaceful citizens. 
That barbarous operation comes in the wake of the problems in 
Bie [Cuito], where on 5 February the MPLA-PT forces broke the 
unilateral cease-fire declared by the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. The MPLA-PT air force's 
attack on Huambo began at precisely 0815 this morning, shortly 
after International Committee of the Red Cross and Caritas 
aircraft had left this city's airport. Though there has been no 
pronouncement [words indistinct] it is known that such 
violations, including air raids, can have a harmful effect on 
the humanitarian aid process, which is trying to save the lives 
of people in this area. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence 
of Angola] has already admitted that the city of Cuito has been 
taken over by government forces. Five hours were enough for the 
government forces to take over the city. Luanda is blaming 
UNITA. In an interview to RDP moments ago, spokesman for the 
Angolan President Aldomiro da Conceicao said he hoped this would 
not happen again: 
  [Begin Conceicao recording] I expect fighting will continue 
in Cuito, but you should not blame the resumption of fighting in 
Cuito on the government forces. UNITA has been engaging in 
offensive operations in several parts of the country and, 
obviously, the government has to react. I hope the fighting 
that resumed on the 2d in Cuito will end soon. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The Angolan peace talks in Lusaka are close to 
breakdown. The government military action in Cuito may lead 
UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] to 
leave the talks. This is another chapter in the war for the 
government, but for Savimbi's movement words are being replaced 
by the law of weapons. More details from Ana Rodrigues: 
  [Rodrigues] [passage omitted] The government says it 
believed 
in UNITA's cease-fire declaration. But government spokesman 
Aldomiro Vaz da Conceicao stated that UNITA has never respected 
that cease-fire: 
  [Begin Conceicao recording] UNITA already stated last year 
that it was declaring a unilateral cease-fire, but it has 
increased its offensive action against government positions and 
its forces since November last year. Therefore UNITA is 
permanently contradicting itself. [passage omitted] 
  I have no doubt whatsoever in stating that it was UNITA that 
started the fighting because it had been engaged for a long time 
in troop maneuvers and in mobilizing its means to take the city 
of Cuito once and for all. [end recording] 
  [Rodrigues] There is an exchange of accusations going on 
between the government and UNITA, the two sides discussing peace 
in Lusaka. UNITA has already stated that the talks are in 
jeopardy at a time when they are discussing the last point on 
the agenda relating to the mandate of UNAVEM [United Nations 
Angola Verification Mission] and the role of observers. The 
government is more optimistic, it says there has always been 
fighting and, despite that, the talks have carried on. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> ["Communique" issued by the UNITA Political Commission in </F>
Huambo on 5 February] 
  [Text] 1. (?Following) the statements of Joao de Matos, 
chief of General Staff of the Angolan Armed Forces on 2 February 
1994, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola [MPLA] 
broke the unilateral cease-fire declared by the National Union 
for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] in Cuito that had 
been in force for more than four months. 
  a. Parachutes have been supplying their troops for four 
months, and this allowed them to get reorganized. 
  b. MPLA aircraft were active the whole day on 5 February 
1994, coming in waves of two bombers against UNITA lines. 
  2. Once more the MPLA has deceived the Angolan people and 
the international community. 
  a. The MPLA claims victory in Cuito because it attacked -- 
it was not defending. Therefore, in less than five hours it 
occupied positions held by UNITA Armed Forces in Cuito. 
  b. All authorizations for the air raids on UNITA lines were 
issued in Luanda. 
  3. UNITA's Political Commission and its General Staff have 
been holding a meeting since 1100 [1000 GMT] on 5 February 1994 
to assess the situation. It has resolved to: 
  a. To try to reestablish the cease-fire unilaterally 
proclaimed by UNITA on 20 September 1993. 
  b. To explore possibilities of continuing with negotiations 
in Lusaka, taking into account the significant progress already 
achieved. 
  4. UNITA condemns France's invitation to the MPLA chairman 
to visit that country to buy weapons in exchange for oil instead 
of assisting the United Nations in its efforts to mediate the 
talks in Lusaka, because this encourages the MPLA to wage war. 
UNITA will once more be ready to face all challenges, the 
biggest of all being the universal cease-fire and peace in 
Angola. 
  [Dated] Huambo, 5 February 1994. 
  [Signed] UNITA's Political Commission.

  [Text] The situation was considered to be calm in the city 
of Cuito today, after violent clashes between government and 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] 
forces yesterday. The residents have taken advantage of that 
calm to bury the dead. Radio Angola reports that 48 people were 
killed and another 62 seriously wounded during clashes on 5 
February. A spokesman for Cuito-based government forces told 
Radio Angola yesterday that his forces had not been caught by 
surprise and had in fact expected such clashes to occur at any 
time. Radio Angola also reported that the UNITA forces were 
using weapons and mortars to, quote, decimate the residents of 
Cuito and reduce the city to ashes, unquote. Jorge Araujo, a 
BBC reporter, has been in touch with UNITA Information Secretary 
Jorge Valentim, who has confirmed that there were fierce clashes 
in Cuito, adding however that the government was to blame and 
that it had attacked first. 
  [Begin recording] [Valentim] It was the government that 
started the clashes. In the wake of orders they received from 
Luanda, the government forces began the fighting. This was in 
line with recent remarks by General Joao de Matos, Angolan Armed 
Forces chief of General Staff. The clashes began at 0745 [0645 
GMT] and continued until about 2000 in the evening. The 
situation remains critical at this stage. We, in the UNITA 
negotiating team, have one position: we lay the responsibility 
for the clashes at the door of the Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola [MPLA] government. We blame the MPLA 
government solely and completely for the start of the clashes. 
Such behavior is in complete contradiction with the Lusaka 
peace talks. 
  [Araujo] What do you view as a critical situation? 
  [Valentim] It is a critical situation because the clashes 
assumed absolutely maximum dimensions. The government took 
certain UNITA positions. There were successive waves of 
bombings against military positions and civilian targets. This 
is a very serious threat to peace in Angola. 
  [Araujo] Are the clashes continuing at this point? 
  [Valentim] I cannot give you any more details but, seeing 
that this was in line with government plans, it is possible that 
clashes are continuing. For instance, the observers and 
mediators here in Lusaka are deeply concerned about the 
situation and believe these clashes must cease because they can 
be harmful to the search for peace in Angola. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Aldemiro Vaz da Conceicao, spokesman for the 
Angolan Government team to the Lusaka peace talks, has granted 
an interview to the Portuguese Radio Broadcasting Corporation, 
RDP, in which he rejected UNITA's version of the events. He 
added that the government had the duty to respond to UNITA 
attacks on civilians and on territorial integrity. 
  Today, AFP quoted UNITA's Voice of Resistance of the Black 
Cockerel, Vorgan Radio, as saying that the UNITA leadership had 
held a special meeting in Huambo and that it had decided 
unilaterally to reestablish the cease-fire in Cuito.

  [Excerpt] This has been another bloody weekend, this time 
in Bie Province. The Angolan government now occupies 80 percent 
of Cuito following another day of intense fighting. More than 
50 people are believed to have died. Hence the peace process is 
threatened once more. The National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] wants the ban on the sale of arms 
and oil to be lifted. Luis Henrique Pereira reports. 
  [Pereira] UNITA is accusing the Angolan Government of being 
solely responsible for the renewed fighting, mainly in the city 
of Cuito. In a communique signed by Jorge Valentim, spokesman 
for the UNITA team at the Lusaka talks, UNITA said that the 
negotiations are now inevitably affected by the fresh fighting 
on Saturday morning. If the situation deteriorates, UNITA has 
threatened to end the dialogue with the government because there 
is now much mistrust. UNITA also wants the sanctions preventing 
the sale of arms to UNITA to be lifted. The sanctions were 
ordered in September by the United Nations. Jorge Valentim said 
that Bosnias are being created in the UNITA areas. He added 
that one side is armed to its teeth and the other side is 
limited to buying arms [as heard]. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Angolan peace talks could be threatened. RDP 
has learned that the U.S. ambassador to Angola has been meeting 
Jorge Valentim [information secretary and UNITA [National Union 
for the Total Independence of Angola] representative at talks] 
in Lusaka. UNITA has blamed the Angolan Government for the 
fighting in Cuito. Jorge Valentim, of UNITA's political 
leadership, told us a few minutes ago about the efforts the 
United States is making with a view to ensuring that the 
negotiations continue. 
  [Begin recording] [Valentim] [words indistinct] The 
observers are calling for an end to the war. They are appealing 
for the war to end. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Are the Lusaka talks threatened 
at the moment? 
  [Valentim] Well, the government's bellicose adventures are 
not conducive to peace and cause uneasy negotiations. But we 
are committed to continuing the talks. [words indistinct] We 
do not agree with these militaristic adventures that are 
threatening peace in Angola. [end recording]

Sekhonyane has been charged with sedition after he allegedly 
incited soldiers to revolt. 
  The Basotho National Party leader was granted bail and the 
case was postponed until February 18. He allegedly told a 
gathering in Maseru in November that soldiers needed to arm 
themselves and that the ruling Basotholand Congress Party 
planned to disband the army. Five soldiers and three civilians 
died in a series of clashes between rival forces in the army 
last month.

<F P=106> [Report by Emilio Manhique] </F>
  [Excerpt] The big news today might have been that the 
training and refresher course for commanding and other senior 
officers of the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces [FADM] began 
today. That course is being attended by 50 men from both sides. 
  However, what really arrested the attention of those present 
-- including guests such as UN Special Representative Aldo 
Ajello, among others -- were the remarks made by Lieutenant 
General Mateus Ngonhamo, of the Mozambique National Resistance, 
Renamo, armed forces. After thanking Portugal for its role in 
the formation of the FADM forces, Lt. Gen. Ngonhamo proceeded to 
cause controvery when he said that all countries posed a threat 
to Mozambique. He was referring to the role that the FADM are 
supposed to play. 
  That Renamo military officer also noted that certain 
Mozambicans are secretly training troops and hiding weapons, 
directly accusing General Eduardo Nihia, Mozambique Liberation 
Front, Frelimo, Party first secretary for Nampula Province, of 
being involved in the training of 1,000 men. At this point, Lt. 
Gen. Ngonhamo affirmed that the United Nations has been informed 
and that a commission (?sent) to investigate the matter had been 
prevented from working on the ground. 
  Indicating that the United Nations had not done that work, 
UN 
Special Representative Aldo Ajello shook his head while Ngonhamo 
made those remarks. [sentence as heard] Later, Aldo Ajello told 
journalists that he was unaware of that problem but he added 
that he will order an investigation if it is indeed true. 
  Subsequently, we interviewed Lieutenant General Tobias Dai, 
of the Mozambique Armed Forces, who expressed great surprise 
about those serious accusations by Mateus Ngonhamo. 
Nonetheless, he said that, should they be true, the government 
will take note and will try to investigate the matter on the 
ground. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The former rebel Renamo [Mozambique National 
Resistance] movement in Mozambique has moved so many of its 
guerrillas into the newly opened assembly points that the camps 
are already overcrowded. UN Operations in Mozambique says the 
big influx of Renamo members took place at two assembly areas 
which were opened early this week. Each was designed to 
accommodate 500 men, but on Wednesday [2 February] 723 Renamo 
guerrillas arrived at Mocubela in the northern Province of 
Zambezia, and further south at Savane in Sofala Province 928 
Renamo members arrived. 
  Throughout the country there are now nearly 18,000 
government 
soldiers and about 11,000 Renamo guerrillas in assembly areas. 
The men are being disarmed under a peace agreement signed by 
the government and Renamo in October 1992. Under the terms of 
the agreement a total of about 80,000 men should go to the 
assembly points. Fifteen thousand men from each side are to be 
incorporated into a new unified defense force while the rest are 
to be demobilized.

<F P=106> [Report by Chris Vermaak] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North 
Korea), one of SWAPO's [South-West African People's 
Organization] biggest former ideological allies in the 
propaganda and armed struggle, has closed its embassy and trade 
mission in Windhoek virtually overnight, sold its assets, left 
behind an unpaid telephone account, and left the country like a 
"thief in the night." The Korean diplomats left the country 
under a cloud of alleged financial and other irregularities 
after they allegedly said in diplomatic circles that Namibia is 
not "productive enough for business." There are unanswered 
questions concerning the manner in which the North Koreans 
allegedly tried to convert huge amounts of Namibian dollars to 
U.S. dollars before leaving the country. 
  A spokesman for the government says that he can confirm, 
unofficially, that the embassy is closed and that personnel, 
including the ambassador, have already returned to North Korea. 
"They left the country like thieves in the night." He said that 
it is not acceptable protocol to expect the government to 
announce that a diplomatic mission is about to close. "It is 
their prerogative to make such an announcement." No one would 
comment on future trade ties between the two countries. 
Earlier, personnel of the North Korean Embassy were under 
suspicion following a transaction concerning two luxury Toyota 
vehicles which they allegedly tried to export to Angola. Two 
diplomats were subsequently asked to return to North Korea. 
[passage omitted] 
  Sources revealed to DIE REPUBLIKEIN that the North Koreans 
had been leaving the country one by one since December last 
year. The ambassador, Kim Pyong-ki, left the country quietly on 
18 January without greeting anyone. [passage omitted] It came 
to light last week that the trade mission had not paid its 
telephone bill of approximately 1,800 rands. Sources say that 
the North Koreans tried to convert large amounts of Namibian 
dollars at a bank in the city for U.S. dollars. They could, 
however, not convert all the money after the bank questioned the 
source of the money and informed the Central Bank. One of the 
senior members of the embassy apparently left the country on 7 
January with an unidentified box. It was tightly wrapped in 
paper and officially sealed. At the airport he apparently 
refused to allow the box to be inspected, citing diplomatic 
immunity. It was apparently not subjected to a check. The 
Embassy of the Republic of Korea (South Korea) said, upon 
inquiry, that it has no intention of leaving the country.

  [Text] Vekuii Rukoro, deputy minister of justice, has 
vehemently denied a report in Friday's edition of THE NAMIBIAN 
to the effect that he was ousted from Cabinet. 
  In a hard hitting statement on Friday, Rukoro also denied 
that he had voiced criticism of lack of Government action 
concerning the alleged involvement of Minister of Justice, 
Ngarikutuke Tjiriange, and deputy Home Affairs minister, Nangolo 
Ithete, in illegal ostrich dealing. He said that no such 
subject had been discussed at Cabinet. 
  On the subject of his future attendance at Cabinet meetings, 
Rukoro said that "following an amicable and comradely discussion 
between the Right Honourable Prime Minister and myself it was 
agreed that my regular attendance at Cabinet meetings was no 
longer necessary in view of the following: as a rule Deputy 
Ministers do not attend Cabinet meetings in their own right but 
only in the absence of their substantive Ministers whom they are 
deputising; His Excellency, the President, however, has the 
power to invite any deputy minister to attend a particular 
session or all sessions of Cabinet by way of a special 
consideration. 
  "Since I was President of the NNF [Namibian National Front] 
and SWANU [South-West African National Union] when I was 
initially appointed as deputy minister, it was agreed between HE 
[His Excellency] the President and myself that by virtue of my 
leadership of NNF and SWANU, I shall be made a regular attendant 
of Cabinet meetings. 
  I resigned the aforesaid positions last September and ever 
since then, strictly speaking, I had no justification attending 
Cabinet meetings in my own right. 
  "It is therefore clear that the decision mutually arrived at 
between the Prime Minister and myself is nothing but a normal 
regularisation of my position and status as ordinary deputy 
minister in Government on a par with other deputy ministers." 
  Rukoro concluded by saying that both he and the Prime 
Minister were "happy" with this arrangement.

  [Text] Harare Feb 7 SAPA -- South African Justice and 
Defence Minister Kobie Coetsee arrived in Harare on Monday [7 
February] for wide-ranging talks with his Zimbabwean judicial 
and security counterparts, in a visit that marks the full 
normalisation of relations between the two neighbouring 
countries. 
  The trip follows the first meeting between President F.W. de 
Klerk and President Robert Mugabe in Gaborone, Botswana, on 
January 26, ending 14 years of arms-length diplomacy between 
Pretoria and the man seen as Africa's most bitter critic of 
apartheid. 
  The one-day trip comprises meetings with Zimbabwe Justice 
Minister Emmerson Mnangagwa, Defence Minister Moven Mahachi and 
Home Affairs Minister Dumiso Dabengwa. 
  Mr Coetsee told reporters on arrival at Harare airport that 
he would be discussing the administration of justice between the 
two countries including re-establishing their extradition 
treaty, which expired in 1986. "We have determined an agenda 
which will support the better administration of justice in our 
region," he said as his meeting with Mr Mnangagwa opened in the 
parliament building. "We have so many issues in common." Mr 
Mnangagwa noted that there were "no more obstacles to us to meet 
and exchange views". 
  Mr Coetsee, who was accompanied by Justice Department 
Director General Jasper Noeth, denied reports that he would 
raise the issue of five South African-hired secret agents -- 
three Zimbabwean citizens and two Britons -- serving life 
sentences in prison for their involvement in espionage, 
assassination and sabotage directed against African National 
Congress targets in Zimbabwe in the mid-eighties when 
ex-president P.W. Botha's campaign to "destabilise" South 
Africa's black-ruled neighbours was at its height. The issue 
was "definitely not on our agenda", he said. 
  Mr Coetsee, invited by the Zimbabwe Government, is the third 
South African cabinet minister to visit Zimbabwe in less than a 
year. 
  Public Enterprises Minister Dawie de Villers was first when 
he visited in may last year for the low-profile signing of an 
agreement to allow Zimbabwe to draw power from Eskom's 
[Electricity Supply Commission] Matimba power station. 
  Finance Minister Derek Keys went later in the year for a 
meeting on trade issues that was kept secret until weeks 
afterwards.

  [Text] Rumors of racial tension, violence, and intimidation 
among members of the new National Peacekeeping Force at De Brug 
outside Bloemfontein are increasing. Nine soldiers of this 
force have already been dismissed due to political activities. 
It is not yet known to which group or groups these soldiers 
belonged. 
  [Begin correspondent Richard Newton recording] It is thought 
that the base of the National Peacekeeping force at De Brug 
outside Bloemfontein is a cauldron of dissension on the verge of 
boiling over. Some allege that language, ethnic, and political 
differences have led to a lack of cooperation. Repeated 
requests to visit the base, also requests to have interviews 
recorded, have been refused. A media day, however, has been 
arranged at the base for next week Thursday. 
  The acting commander of the National Peacekeeping Force, 
Col. 
Fred Burger, responded to our question by fax, confirming that 
cooperation between the troops at the base had become a problem. 
He added, however, that soldiers from such diverse groups needed 
time to adapt. Col. Burger rejected rumors of racial tension 
and physical assaults among the troops, saying they were false. 
What is in fact true, he said, is that there is room for 
improvement regarding hygiene; that limited intimidation has 
been noted, and that more than 20 soldiers had requested to 
return to their units. 
  The media visit to the base next week could help to 
eliminate 
some of the rumors. The commander of the peace force, Gen. 
Ramushwana, will nevertheless have his hands full when he takes 
over command next week. [end recording] 
  The first group of voluntary military recruits after decades 
of military service today joined the South African Defense 
Force. Five thousand young men from all population groups 
reported at centers in Durban, Cape Town, Pretoria, and 
Johannesburg. A large group was turned away in Johannesburg. 
  [Begin correspondent Nan Roux recording] Hundreds of young 
men began gathering in front of the gates at Nasrec [convention 
center] outside Johannesburg this morning. For many it was a 
waste of time, however. Only those with the right 
qualifications and documents were allowed through the gates. A 
very disconcerted group had to remain outside. Inside the 
gates, though, those with the right documents marched away in 
real military style for their first taste of the Defense Force. 
The recruits will be sent to bases in Pretoria and 
Bloemfontein, and to Potchefstroom and Heidelberg. After eight 
months of initial training, they will be able to join either the 
Defense Force's corps services or the Citizen Force. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Bloemfontein Feb 6 SAPA -- ANC [African National 
Congress] President Nelson Mandela says he turned down an 
invitation to visit the National Peacekeeping Force [NKPF] base 
at De Brug in the [Orange] Free State because he did not want 
the force to be identified with the ANC, SABC [South African 
Broadcasting Corporation] radio news reports. Mr Mandela was 
responding to questions at a media briefing in Bloemfontein on 
Sunday morning, at which journalists asked him what the ANC 
would do about alleged trouble at De Brug. Mr Mandela that he 
requested a full briefing from MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe, Spear of 
the Nation -- ANC armed wing commander Joe Modise, but that he 
was confident that the joint command of the National 
Peacekeeping Force would sort the problems out independently of 
the ANC. He said he had full confidence in the NKPF leader, 
Brigadier Gabriel Ramushwana, who had proved himself an able 
leader on many occasions. Mr Mandela said he wanted all South 
Africans to have confidence in the force, because it was there 
to serve South Africa's people at a critical moment in their 
history.

  [Text] Cape Town Feb 7 SAPA -- The Democratic Party [DP] 
has demanded that impartial observers and the media be allowed 
to visit National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] training camps to 
investigate reports that they are in shambles. 
  DP Western Cape leader Mr Hennie Bester said in a statement 
on Monday [7 February] his party was deeply distressed by the 
ongoing reports of "total shambles" in these camps. "The 
appointment of Major-General Ramushwana and his acknowledgement 
that the force will not be ready for election day has done 
nothing to calm these fears." 
  The Western Cape DP demanded that impartial observers and 
the 
media be allowed to visit the camps and make a full public 
report. "Should these reports prove to be correct, the 
Democratic Party will do everything in its power to resist the 
deployment of the peace-keeping force in the Western Cape. 
Intimidators cannot be used to combat intimidation," Mr Bester 
said. 
  Two alternative possiblities were: 

  -  that a force be drawn from citizens in the Western Cape 
and be trained in the region; and, 
  -  that international peace-keepers be asked to do the job.

  [Text] Port Elizabeth Feb 7 SAPA -- Democratic Party [DP] 
defence spokesman Gen Bob Rogers says members of the fledgling 
National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] must be placed under existing 
military discipline codes as there is no time to draw up a new 
code. 
  Reacting on Monday [7 February] to the reported shambolic 
situation at the NPKF's [Orange] Free State training camp, Gen 
Rogers said those involved in the reported ill-discipline and 
those in command should be condemned in the strongest terms. "A 
question which needs to be answered is where the force 
commander, Brigadier (Gabriel) Ramushwana, was during the events 
described." 
  Gen Rogers said discipline was an essential factor in any 
military or police force and especially so in one which had been 
tasked to keep the peace in the run-up to the April election. 
  "Members must be placed under some existing form of military 
or police discipline code as time does not allow a new code to 
be drawn up."

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Themba Molefe] </F>
  [Text] The National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] will not be 
ready by election day on April 26, says its commanding officer, 
Major General Gabriel Ramushwana. He spoke to SOWETAN last 
Friday [4 February], shortly before startling allegations of a 
lack of discipline, desertions and drunkenness within the NPKF's 
3,500-strong force outside Bloemfontein hit the headlines. The 
force was originally scheduled to complete its training at the 
end of March for deployment in troubled townships in the last 
four weeks of the election campaign. The force was aimed at 
ensuring non-partisan policing and was envisaged to grow to 
10,000 men and women. 
  Ramushwana was particularly critical of the standard of 
training of Umkhonto weSizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC military 
wing--MK] soldiers in the NPKF. This was also against the 
background of claims that four MK cadres were dismissed from the 
De Brug base where the NPKF began training two weeks ago. "I am 
not hopeful that the national peacekeeping force will be ready 
in the remaining six weeks it has to prepare for elections," 
Ramushwana said. 
  He was appointed NPKF commanding officer by the Transitional 
Executive Council last month. He said he found no basis for 
allegations that MK soldiers had shouted racist slogans. With 
regard to problems at NPKF headquarters, ANC spokesman Mr Carl 
Niehaus said yesterday's news reports were "an overstatement and 
were calculated to put MK in a bad light". He rejected 
Ramushwana's claim that MK training was below standard, saying 
any soldier would have difficulty adjusting to new forms of 
training. ANC president Mr Nelson Mandela told journalists in 
Bloemfontein he was confident Ramushwana would be able to sort 
out the problems.

  [Text] The president of the ANC [African National 
Congress], Mr. Nelson Mandela, has told a gathering of business 
people at Welkom that white South Africans should become aware 
of the consequences of right-wing violence. Mr. Mandela said 
once the ANC took countermeasures against the right wing, both 
blacks and whites would die, and innocent people would be 
sacrificed. He said the ANC did not want to retaliate against 
the right wing, and he added that the organization was still 
prepared to meet right-wing leaders and talk some sense into 
them, as he put it. Mr. Mandela said there is no possibility of 
the establishment of a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland], but added 
that he was prepared to discuss a compromise, although this 
would take a long time.

  [Text] Pretoria Feb 6 SAPA -- Law and Order Minister Hernus 
Kriel says ANC [African National Congress] leader Nelson 
Mandela's threat of unlimited violence to counter right-wing 
attacks are "hysterical and irresponsible". Reacting Sunday to 
Mr Mandela's warning in the [Orange] Free State on Saturday [5 
February] that the right wing's threatened "limited violence" 
would be met with unlimited violence from the African National 
Congress, Mr Kriel said this was just terrorism in another form. 
"Mr Mandela's proposed cure of further unlimited violence 
will...be far worse than the illness itself and could incite 
random attacks on innocent people and unleash a new cycle of 
violence." The only way to combat the attacks -- including 
several bombings of ANC offices -- apparently being carried out 
by the right wing was to infiltrate their terrorist cells. This 
was a time-consuming process but was the only way, said Mr Kriel.

<F P=106> [By Lew Elias] </F>
  [Text] Bloemfontein Feb 6 SAPA -- African National Congress 
[ANC] President Nelson Mandela used a packed stadium at 
Botshabelo to launch a scathing verbal attack on Bophuthatswana 
President Lucas Mangope on Sunday. This followed earlier 
incidents at roadblocks in the small section of Bophuthatswana 
around Thaba'nchu in the Orange Free State. 
  The roadblocks seemed to be set up to prevent Mr Mandela and 
a large ANC and press contingent from laying a wreath on the 
grave a former ANC president, Dr James Moroka, whose family 
still farm in the Thaba'nchu District. 
  ANC NEC [National Executive Committee] member and the 
organisation's Orange Free State presidential candidate, Patrick 
"Terror" Lekota left his vehicle as Bophuthatswana defence force 
soldiers ordered the 20 to 25 car caravan to stop. "We were 
told we would not be allowed through -- but went anyway," Mr 
Lekota told SAPA after the wreath laying ceremony. 
  Mr Mandela told more than 30,000 cheering supporters at 
Botshabelo, about 50km from Bloemfontein: "As we entered 
Thaba'nchu we came across a roadblock set out up by Mangope. 
They were lucky they did not prevent us. I made it clear to my 
men here, whether they liked it or not, we would go through. 
Mangope on several occasions has said why does the president of 
the ANC single me out from other homeland leaders. The question 
is answered by him throwing up roadblocks preventing people 
carrying on free political activity. This makes us loathe him 
from the bottom of our hearts." 
  Wearing a blue and grey blanket and Basotho hat Mr Mandela 
added: "We don't need permission from Mangope to move around our 
country. You must understand that Mangope and his police force 
are cowards. As we approached them his police were fiddling with 
their guns. I was sure if I left the car and walked towards him 
he would drop the gun and run away. In spite of all this, if 
Mangope wants to settle we are prepared, for the good of our 
country and the good of our people, to listen to what he has to 
say to us." 
  Mr Mandela is believed to have a meeting with Mr Mangope on 
Monday morning before the Bophuthatswana leader goes into talks 
with the government on the Freedom Alliance's [FA] participation 
in the election. 
  Speaking about former FA members, Mr Mandela mentioned 
Transkei and Ciskei leaders who had left the alliance. "Now 
(Ciskei leader Brig Oupa Gqozo), who was part of the Freedom 
Alliance, has deserted them and come into the democratic 
movement. We have accepted Brig Gqozo into the Transitional 
Executive Council and some of his men are being trained as part 
of the National Peacekeeping Force. These leaders from the 
homelands have shown more vision than Mangope or Gqozo. And in 
spite of all the unspeakable crimes he (Mangope) has committed 
we are prepared to sit down and find a solution with him," Mr 
Mandela said to deafening applause and drumbeats. 
  Mr Mandela then addressed the issues of the upcoming 
election 
and told his audience that many of them had been driven away 
from the farms. "Many of you are without jobs, houses and 
security. Your problems are due to the fact that the National 
Party [NP] government does not consider that your problems, 
suffering and hardships are part of their responsibility. They 
are interested in serving the needs of the white minority. The 
majority of the farmers support the NP and that is why they do 
not care for you. That is why you have low wages. That is why 
they don't care." 
  He then went on to tell the crowd their votes were secret 
and 
no one would know who they voted for. 
  On a lighter note he suggested when an employer offered a 
worker money and transport to the polling station to vote for 
the NP, "you should take his R[rand]10, let him take you to the 
voting station and then cast your vote for the ANC. 
  Speaking about NP claims the ANC did not have the resources 
to implement its proposals, Mr Mandela pointed to large scale 
government corruption and the selling off of state enterprises 
that, he said, "were only set up to benefit whites". "And then 
they say we have no resources to carry out our reform 
programmes." "Now that there is a possibility of a black 
government taking over they have decided to get rid of those 
state enterprises and privatise them. The effect of 
privatisation is that wealth will remain in the hands of whites 
in this country. The conspiracy between the government and the 
mining houses by which the mining houses own the mineral 
resources under the ground is another way of taking money away 
from a new government. Up to two years ago the minerals were 
the property of the state, and the mining houses only had 
permission to remove them. Now as a black government is to take 
over they have changed the rules." 
  "Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank stated that in 
one year R10-billion had left this country. That money has left 
the country because of the actions of the present government," 
Mr Mandela said. 
  "The NP now argues after the corruption, privatisation and 
its covert operations, we should not have a programme which will 
ensure a better life for our people. What hypocrisy. We are 
dealing with hypocrites, people with no vision, who are now 
panicking." 
  "The number of people who have turned up during my election 
campaign shows very clearly that the NP is detested by our 
people like leprosy. And lepers they indeed are." 
  He also called on the top levels of the civil service to 
start thinking about programmes for a new government and to stop 
behaving as custodians of apartheid. "The public service 
continues to behave as if apartheid was alive and well. The sad 
truth is that the public service still behaves as if they are 
servants of the National Party. It is time for the public 
service to demonstrate its allegiance to South Africa. There is 
no one in South Africa who does not know the ANC is going to be 
the next government. President de Klerk still behaves as if the 
public service is his, and the SADF [South African Defense 
Force] is his private army."

  [Text] Bloemfontein Feb 4 SAPA -- African National Congress 
[ANC] nominee for the [Orange] Free State premiership Patrick 
Lekota has warned rightwing organisations not to misconstrue the 
ANC's "peace gospel" as an inability to take on anybody in a 
fight. 
  Addressing students at Bloemfontein's Vista University on 
Friday, Mr Lekota said his organisation was aware of the 
rightwing's bombing campaign against the ANC, which had already 
damaged offices in Parys, Bothaville, Harrismith and other areas. 
  Referring to "civil war preachings" by elements in the 
Freedom Alliance, he said: "Let me warn them. Our peace gospel 
should not be taken for cowardice or inability to take on 
anybody if there is need to fight. We are given today to solve 
the problems of this country peacefully, so let's not waste that 
chance, for it may not come again," said Mr Lekota.

<F P=106> [Report by Mike Robinson] </F>
  [Text] Although the new North-West province includes 
Bophuthatswana and many right-wing strongholds, the SUNDAY TIMES 
poll shows that, as in the rest of the country, the ANC [African 
National Congress] is by far the most popular party. According 
to the poll conducted by Makinor in November, the ANC can expect 
to get the votes of 74 percent of those willing and able to 
vote, the National Party [NP] 15 percent and the AVF [Afrikaner 
Volksfront, Afrikaner Nation Front]/CP [Conservative Party] nine 
percent. 
  Should the voting trend indicated in the poll survive the 
campaign, the ANC can expect to get 24 of the 34 seats in the 
North- West parliament. The NP would get five seats, the CP/AVF 
three. Undecided voters will determine the allocation of the 
remaining two seats. 
  Members of the North-West parliament will elect 10 senators 
to represent the province in Parliament. Based on the poll, the 
ANC will have seven senators and the NP and AVF/CP one each. 
The allocation of the final seat will be decided by the manner 
in which undecided voters cast their ballots. 
  The North-West will also elect 17 people to represent the 
province in the National Assembly. The poll shows the ANC can 
expect to get 12 of these seats, the NP three and the AVF/CP 
one. Undecided voters will decide the allocation of the final 
seat.

<F P=106> [Interview with President F.W. de Klerk by correspondent Max </F>
du Preez on the "Agenda" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Du Preez] The man who made that speech is here with 
me tonight. Mr. F.W. de Klerk, leader of the National Party 
[NP], who (?lifts) its election manifesto this morning. Good 
evening, Mr. de Klerk. 
  [De Klerk] Good evening, Mr. du Preez. 
  [Du Preez] Mr. de Klerk, your manifesto calls you the man 
for 
justice and peace, and in fact the National Party promises that 
through its manifesto it will bring peace to South Africa. I'm 
sure there will be many people who will want to ask you tonight: 
Why don't you do it now? 
  [De Klerk] Firstly, let me say that the insert which was 
shown referring to the season of violence ....[changes thought] 
The season of the violence that we've had up to 1990 indeed was 
over, and the violence which occurred since then more and more 
became a violence of a different nature. Before 1990, before 
the unbanning of the ANC, Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the nation 
-- ANC Military Wing] and the security forces were killing each 
other. There was an armed struggle between the ANC [African 
National Congress], the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] forces, 
and the security forces of South Africa. We have succeeded in 
defusing that armed struggle. 
  [Du Preez] But you promise peace now. 
  [De Klerk] Let me just first come to this. The violence 
which has occurred since has a totally different character. We 
now have Zulus and Xhosas killing each other. We now have 
supporters of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and the ANC at 
each other's throats in terms of various findings of the 
Goldstone Commission. It's a different violence. I kept my 
promise to end that season of violence. The violence that we 
now have is of a very complicated nature. There is no quick fix 
for it. 
  [Du Preez] Yet that's what you promised. 
  [De Klerk] Yes, and that is what we'll get through a proper 
democratic process. That is what we'll get if all the leaders 
assume their fair share of responsibility. My supporters are 
not killing anybody. My supporters are not involved in the 
burning down of houses. My supporters are not -- on a daily 
basis at each other's throat in Thokoza and Katlehong. My 
supporters there are intimidated. I have supporters there. My 
supporters there are being killed. We need the leaders of the 
ANC and the IFP to take a much more direct interest in 
disciplining their supporters as well. But can I just say, with 
regard to the trouble spots, the government is doing everything 
in its power. We've just -- with a multiparty agreement -- in 
conjunction with the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] 
launched an imaginative initiative on the East Rand which is 
where so many people were being killed. We're not sitting on 
our hands. 
  [Du Preez] I see in your manifesto, and I quote you, what 
you've just said: The National Party does not kill people. The 
National Party does not threaten people. And again, I'm sure 
the relatives of Steve Biko, and Dulcie September, and David 
Webster, and Anton Lubowski would want me to ask you when did 
you change your mind? When did you stop doing that? 
  [De Klerk] Well, firstly, in some of the instances you are 
referring to, accusations were made where no proof exists. If 
at any time in the past and now, and in the future, security 
forces are involved in breaking the law, it's wrong. And I have 
without fear -- fearlessly -- ordered full investigation. Where 
there is evidence we will prosecute. But the National Party of 
today... 
  [Du Preez, interrupting] But the CCB [Civil Cooperation 
Bureau], we had evidence, we had a commission, we had evidence. 
  [De Klerk] And we had one of the best judges and one of the 
best prosecutors and they couldn't uncover evidence which really 
led to prosecution, because people, in as much as they were 
guilty, apparently covered their tracks so well that there was 
no evidence, and we live in a civil country. You cannot charge 
a man without evidence. We cannot go back to the law of the 
jungle because of rumors, because of even well-founded 
suspicion. But without evidence in a civilized country where 
you say we adhere to the rule of law, you wait until you get 
evidence. 
  [Du Preez] Mr. de Klerk, let me interrupt you there and say 
to you that it is my perception that this very fact that you 
still, and your government still denies the existence of death 
squads, the fact that you killed your opponents. I'm talking 
about your party over the last decade or two, that makes it so 
difficult for South Africans to forget, to bring up the past 
every now and again as you object to sometimes? 
  [De Klerk] No, no. 
  [Du Preez] How can people forgive you if the government 
doesn't even, is not even prepared to say, yes we did it and it 
was wrong? 
  [De Klerk] No, no I'm sorry, there are policemen in jail 
because evidence was uncovered, and they've been found guilty. 
There are members of the SADF [South African Defense Force] in 
jail. It is simply just not true to say that we are covering 
anything up. At the moment, with regard to the death of Goniwe, 
there is a judicial commission of inquiry, we've put every piece 
of evidence, we've given them every form of assistance. It is 
unfair to say that there is any effort on our side to cover up. 
  But can I come back, you say when did we change. There was 
war at a certain stage. Certain things were done which fell 
outside the scope of a war. Certain things were done which fell 
within the scope of a war. But that war has ended because of 
our initiatives, because we became a new National Party, because 
we scrapped apartheid, because we removed the cause for the 
struggle, because we freed the people, because we repealed all 
legislation with regard to discrimination. And that new 
National Party is not involved in violence whatsoever. That new 
National Party has freed also the security forces from being 
used as political instruments. The first thing I did when I 
became president, in the first three months I called together 
the top management of both the police and the SADF and said 
never again will you be asked to act as a political instrument, 
you are there to safeguard the lives and property of all South 
Africans. 
  [Du Preez] And do you think black South Africans find this 
credible? Is it not your perception that most black South 
Africans, especially those in the opposition in the past years, 
still firmly believe that those of them who had been killed, and 
poisoned, and whatever, had been done by state death squads and 
not by some unknown force. Who killed all these people? 
  [De Klerk] Yes, obviously, obviously many people, including 
I, would like to get the real facts. And I have nothing against 
crime committed in the past being uncovered. But if we were 
constantly to dwell on the past in trying to prepare for the 
future, if I were to constantly say I cannot trust the ANC 
because they planted the Pretoria bomb in which so many people 
were killed, because Mr. McBride killed innocent bystanders by 
putting a bomb in a supermarket then where would we be.... 
  [Du Preez, interrupting] But they admitted. You don't you 
say you need evidence? 
  [De Klerk] No, but this election that we're talking about 
tonight is about the future. It is about what people now say 
and now do. I have publicly said that in as much as in the 
past, people have been hurt, their dignity have been impaired, 
people became the prey of deeds and action which brought about 
hurt and damage, we are sorry. 
  [Du Preez] Would you reopen the Biko inquest? 
  [De Klerk] If there is sufficient evidence, yes. 
  [Du Preez] Mr. de Klerk, let's move on. Analysts find it 
significant that you've now lately been reviving the red danger, 
the communist danger. At your conference again you spoke about 
that. When you demonize your opponents so much in this 
campaign, do you keep in mind that in May you will sit with 
those very people in a coalition government, in a government of 
national unity? When you've demonized them so much, would it 
not impair a new government? 
  [De Klerk] Before I reply directly, let me just say Mr. 
Mandela will have to sit with me, a man he accuses of not caring 
for black lives, a man he accuses of not caring. So in an 
election, politics isn't for sissies. In an election -- a free 
and fair election -- you focus on your opponents weaknesses, and 
it is a tremendous weakness of the ANC that it remains in 
alliance with a totally discredited ideology. 
  [Du Preez] But are you really scared of communism? Isn't it 
dead? 
  [De Klerk] No, I'm not scared of communism, otherwise I 
wouldn't have unbanned the SACP [South African Communist Party]. 
I think that on their own the SA Communist Party is worth 
nothing. They are a pushover. But I think, that the fact that 
so many prominent SA communists are sitting in high power 
positions in the ANC makes them dangerous, and therefore my 
attack is upon the alliance, and I say that the African National 
Congress needs to distance itself from communism as the whole 
world has done, and even the ex-communists have done. And while 
these people remain there, it makes the ANC an extremely 
dangerous party because those communists, according to their own 
publication, have a hidden agenda. 
  [Du Preez] Let's move back to violence for a minute. It is 
safe to say that our election will not be violence-free. In 
your opinion, how much violence can we tolerate on those few 
days as to not jeopardize the legitimacy of that election? And 
jointly with that, can we have that if Inkatha and Volksfront 
[National Front] do not take part? 
  [De Klerk] Let me deal with the first question first. It 
will depend on how widespread it is, on how serious it is. If 
it is localized to a few localities then the Independent 
Electoral Commission has sufficient powers to isolate those 
areas in a certain sense of the word, and to declare the rest of 
the election free and fair and not to let those votes count. If 
it is widespread, then it will be the duty of the Independent 
Electoral Commission to say that the elections haven't been free 
and fair, and they have the power to declare it null and void. 
I hope that we can avoid it. I believe that yes, while it 
won't be totally violence-free, I think that if everybody does 
their job from now until the 27th of April -- all the mechanisms 
which we have created, all the political leaders who 
participate, then we can assure, and especially the TEC by the 
way. We can assure that it will be free and fair. If all... 
  [Du Preez, interrupting] What about an Angolan option if 
Inkatha and Volksfront do not take part? 
  [De Klerk] Inkatha and the Volksfront together still 
represent, although a significant minority, but a very clear 
minority. Definitely more than 80 percent of all the people in 
South Africa want this election to take place, they want it to 
succeed, they are committed, and they want to participate in it. 
We cannot allow a minority to stop the train of history, to 
stop the course of events. We cannot allow a minority to hold 
the whole country, which wants this election to take place, to 
ransom. And therefore if there is such a boycott, we'll have to 
manage it. If it is peaceful, that is for them a democratic 
option although I think a very short-sighted one to exercise. 
If, however, it is not a passive boycott, but if it becomes 
undermining, if it becomes violence related, then we'll have to 
act very firmly and ensure that that minority and those who 
participate in violence will not succeed in upsetting what this 
country needs and wants. 
  [Du Preez] Let's go to your election manifesto. Like the 
other parties, you offer jobs and houses and education and 
health care and whatever. But isn't also true that your 
government has been in power for 46 years. Why do you promise 
them no we don't have those things. Can you with credibility 
promise those things if you haven't delivered in 46 years? 
  [De Klerk] But can I take you on a trip to show you what we 
have delivered? 
  [Du Preez) A very short one. 
  [De Klerk] No, it will be a very long trip. For years we've 
been building one new school per school day. Some of them have 
been burned down, some of the have been burned down by whom? 
For years we've been successfully making good progress with 
regard to housing. Who stopped to a certain extent housing in 
the past two years? The boycotts ordered by the civics, the ANC 
Youth League. Who is responsible for the breakdown in the 
continuance of those programs? The disruptions caused in the 
townships under the leadership of ANC surrogates. We have money 
which we could have spent in the past years on housing, but 
because of the unrest created by ANC-related organizations, we 
couldn't spend it. We made two and a half thousand million 
rands available for housing and through sabotage and putting up 
stumbling blocks, not all of that money could've been spent. 
  The ANC has robbed the townships of thousands and thousands 
of houses. The boycotts frightened off the private sector. We 
had a successful scheme going where the private sector started 
financing housing on a grand scale, when they stopped paying 
their installments all private sector involved in investment 
stopped. The ANC.... 
  [Du Preez, interrupting] But you're talking about the 
resistance that started because of.... 
  [De Klerk, interrupting] Now I'm saying we have a proud 
track 
record of -- even under apartheid -- of doing much with regard 
to improvement of health care, improvement of education, 
improvement of this, that, and the other. Under sanctions, in a 
period when as a result of sanctions, as well as a result of 
extraneous factors such as the heaviest drought, the drop in the 
gold price, a world recession, funds were scarce. 
  Now that we've had good rains, the sanctions are gone, the 
world economy is slowly starting to pick up, the future is rosy. 
If we can get investment we'll have more jobs, government 
income will increase, and in an economically healthy way we will 
be able to expand more on more imaginative development projects. 
So, our promise we can make good. But the fundamental 
difference is whose economic policy will generate the growth. 
  We make the same promises than the ANC, but the difference 
is 
that with their economic policy there won't be foreign 
investment. With their economic policy there will be further 
capital outflow as there now is as result of the regular wild 
statements which they make. With our economic policy we will 
attract the investment, and therefore we will be able to make 
good on our promises. 
  [Du Preez] Can I quickly take you to one other field before 
we take an ad [advertisement] break. Corruption in the 
government over the last 15 years has been of the greatest on 
the continent. Some of the ministers have even been jailed, what 
guarantee do we have now that if we vote for your party we won't 
see a repeat of National Party corruption? 
  [De Klerk] Well, firstly most of the corruption that you 
refer to in the later years occurred in basically two of the 
self- governing states. The chief ministers of those two 
self-governing states are now on the candidates list of the ANC. 
We ordered judicial commissions of inquiry into it. 
  [Du Preez] But I think by referring to homelands you're 
escaping the fact that a lot of that was in the central 
government? 
  [De Klerk] Oh no. 
  [Du Preez] We had pictures on Sunday newspaper front pages 
of 
toilets in the veld. As I said we have ministers in jail? 
  [De Klerk] But then you must define corruption. That wasn't 
corrupt to build it. It might have been a misdirected 
development action. But that's not corruption. Corruption is 
when money is misused, is under the table allocated to something 
which wasn't properly authorized, etc, etc. That was a residue 
of an effort to create development in a place where people 
didn't want to go. It might have been a mistake, but not 
corruption. 
  [Du Preez] I think we'll be back. There'll be more after 
this. [commercial break] 
  [Du Preez] Our guest on Agenda is Mr. de Klerk, leader of 
the 
National Party. Mr. de Klerk, a question that I think many 
people in the world have wanted to ask you, who are interested 
in South Africa. On February the second, 1990. That speech 
that we watched earlier. Did you have a fundamental change of 
heart, or was it a change of strategy because of pressure? 
  [De Klerk] Well, I and the whole National Party had a 
fundamental change of heart, but it wasn't a Damascus Road 
experience, that suddenly one morning we stood up and said we've 
got to change. 
  [Du Preez] Did it happen towards the last year of the P.W. 
Botha regime? 
  [De Klerk] It was a process which started in the early 
eighties, and in 1986 we formally held a federal congress and 
changed our policy and said, we're scrapping separate 
development. And we held a special election to get a renewed 
mandate from the white electorate to say we now stand for one 
united South Africa with an equal vote for all with one 
citizenship, and with all forms of racial discrimination to be 
disbanded, and we won it. And I won it again in 1989. What 
happened on the second of February 1990 is that that change of 
heart, which took place over the previous four, five, six years, 
and which we actually formalized, then came together in an 
action plan to say, we've changed our mind, our heart, now we 
must start moving and do what we believe in is right for South 
Africa. That was the beginning of an implementation phase 
towards working really towards reconciliation, towards bringing 
peace to South Africa, towards burying the past. 
  [Du Preez] I see a right wing newspaper said General Tienie 
Groenewald wrote that speech for you. Is that true? 
  [De Klerk] No. It's absolutely untrue. I would like to call 
my wife as a witness. That speech was written in my own hand, 
at my own desk, in my own home and if I remember correctly one 
evening at a dining room table. That speech was my product, but 
it was also the product of a bosberaad [bush summit], a previous 
think tank meeting with my whole cabinet, with our advisers... 
  [Du Preez, interrupting] Do you still have that speech? Is 
it framed, or is it somewhere? 
  [De Klerk] I am not sentimental about such things. I haven't 
framed it, but it must be around somewhere. 
  [Du Preez] Mr. de Klerk you are a boerseun [farm lad] with 
deep roots in the Western Transvaal. When you're walking in the 
fields and you take the soil and you feel it between your 
fingers, what does your heart tell you? Whose soil is that? 
  [De Klerk] When I do that my dominant emotion is I love this 
country, this beautiful country, and yes, I say that country 
belongs to all its people. I'm an Afrikaner. My forebears, and 
yours, unless they remained in the Cape... 
  [Du Preez, interrupting] Hulle was ook Doppers [preceding 
four words in Afrikaans -- they were also members of the 
Reformed Church] 
  [De Klerk, continuing] ...fought the first anti-colonial 
freedom war on African soil in modern history. I am an African. 
I am not a European. You are an African, and this country, we 
say, we must share with all of us who live here, who will die 
here, and whose children will live here. 
  [Du Preez] Talking about Doppers, they are different from 
the 
rest of us. Doppers -- from the Reformed Church, for those who 
do not know -- are supposed to be more puritan and more honest 
than the rest of us, Afrikaners, I mean. What has this 
Gereformeerde -- this reformed tradition, what has it meant in 
your political style, in your political thinking? 
  [De Klerk] Well, firstly, inasmuch as Doppers might have 
that 
image, I think it's a wrong image, and if Doppers think 
themselves better than others, then it is a very, very grave sin 
that they are committing. I don't think they are better than 
anybody else. But yes, theologically speaking... 
  [Du Preez, interrupting] They have a no nonsense approach? 
  [De Klerk] ...they are relatively puritan. 
  [Du Preez] Yes. 
  [De Klerk] Politically speaking, they have always been 
verlig 
[enlightened]. It has had a tremendous influence on me. I 
studied at the Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher 
Education which says that you must look at science, at 
everything, in the light of the word of God, and it had a 
tremendous influence on my whole outlook on life. It has taught 
me, whenever I have to tackle even a practical problem, to ask 
what is the principle involved. 
  [Du Preez] You are also a man with a sense of history, and I 
remember reading some day long ago, that you are a great admirer 
of General Koos de la Rey [words indistinct] coincidentally. 
Does that not mean that you have a real deep understanding of 
the fears and the anger of the white right wing at the moment? 
  [De Klerk] Oh yes. I have a deep understanding. I have a 
very deep understanding of it, and I know that there are many, 
many people in that camp at the moment who are genuine people, 
who are God-fearing South Africans and Afrikaners, and who are 
agonizing, and I am going out of my way to try and convince them 
that there is a way, that they must turn away from the cul de 
sac into which they are moving, that it is wrong to become 
emotional and adhere to a policy which cannot work or succeed in 
practice. But the ultra radicals there who are planning 
violence, I ask them to also go back in history and to know that 
from 1910 onward at least twice there were efforts by Afrikaners 
to, through violence, try and achieve their ideals. It never 
worked. 
  [Du Preez] But you.... 
  [De Klerk, interrupting] We got our republic through 
constitutional means, not the OB [Ossewa Brandwag -- Ox wagon 
Guard], not the Gryshemde [Gray Shirts], not the Stormjaers 
[Storm Riders], not General de Wet in the 1914 rebellion. But 
those who said -- I will use whatever constitutional opportunity 
I get to advance my cause -- they had success in South African, 
in Afrikaans political history. 
  [Du Preez] Mr. de Klerk can I ask you a very 
straightforward, 
almost intimate question? Is there in your heart, or your mind 
somewhere, a small bit that wants a volkstaat [homeland] for the 
Afrikaner? 
  [De Klerk] No. Nowhere. In the sense that I am convinced it 
is not achievable, in my heart I want the Afrikaner nation, 
together with the Zulu nation, together with the Xhoza nation, 
together with any other nation which has a sense of pride in its 
history, in its traditions, which is proud of its language, to 
have room and space in South Africa to maintain that which is 
dear to it, to be sure, to have security that they won't be 
suppressed by anybody else. But I believe that the Afrikaner 
nation and all other nations can only survive in South Africa, 
and can only have a proud existence in South Africa if they find 
a way in which to coexist peacefully. 
  [Du Preez] Do you think General Constand Viljoen is a man of 
integrity? 
  [De Klerk] I think that he is a man of integrity, and I 
think 
that he has reached a moment of truth, because his integrity has 
to a great extent been rejected at that congress where he was 
shouted down. He said there, he opened a way, he indicated a 
direction which could be followed. If he believes in that, I 
think he must stand up and give a lead that that direction must 
be followed. 
  [Du Preez] Mr. de Klerk, let's move on and away from the 
right wing. South Africans and the world have seen you and Mr. 
Nelson Mandela as partners, as a team that brought us where we 
are now. What is it that you have in common with Nelson Mandela? 
  [De Klerk] I think we have in common a commitment that 
through negotiation, and continued negotiation -- because after 
the election we'll have once again a constant negotiation 
situation -- we'll have to find ways and means of fully ending 
conflict and of breaking through to a form of cooperation in the 
best interests of all the people. There is much which divides 
us but I think we have that in common that we want a peaceful 
solution. What I'm dissatisfied with, because I don't question 
his integrity, is his lack of action against the wild elements 
in his party and in his movement. 
  [Du Preez] Mr. de Klerk, you are sitting in the voorkamer 
[sitting room] of the home of Mrs. Gladys Tshabalala and her 
family in Zone 13 Katlehong. She says to you I want to vote. 
You have exactly two minutes to tell her why she should vote 
for your party. What would you tell her? 
  [De Klerk] I think I will start with the negative and say: 
You have really a choice between two parties, because she 
wouldn't be interested in voting CP [Conservative Party], and in 
all probability she won't be interested in voting IFP [Inkatha 
Freedom Party]. If she discusses the IFP with me I'll tell her 
it's such a negative party, against anything, not cooperating -- 
that I wouldn't put my fate in their hands -- and I would tell 
her that you have a basic choice between the ANC and the 
National Party, and then I would tell her why I think the ANC is 
a dangerous party. I would remind her that the ANC ruined her 
son's education. I would remind her that ANC supporters burned 
down her sister's house, etcetera, etcetera, and then I would 
say but why should you vote for me? And I would tell her that 
the National Party is really a party of peace, that the National 
Party has constantly in the past four years been the only 
binding force which kept us on a sane road. It is the only 
party which never left negotiations. It is the only party which 
never boycotted. It is the only party with an economic policy 
which can create jobs for her children because it will attract 
investment, and I will show her -- my heart -- that I care, that 
I want to improve her lot and I will ask her to accept that this 
party is a new party with a vision for the future, that it has 
buried its past and I will ask her to take my hand. 
  [Du Preez] Unfortunately we will not know what Mrs. 
Tshabalala is going to say. 
  [De Klerk] We will on the 27 April. 
  [Du Preez] Thank you very much Mr. de Klerk and good night. 
  [De Klerk] Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Interview with President F.W. de Klerk in Johannesburg by </F>
announcer Jon Snow in London on 4 January; from the "Channel 4" 
newscast--recorded] 
  [Text] [Snow] Is there still a chance of persuading Inkatha 
to participate in the elections? 
  [De Klerk] I think, maybe because time is becoming of the 
essence, it is just possible that a form of accommodation and 
settlement can be reached. Even if it does not take place, then 
it is not impossible that Inkatha, as an active party with a 
sound organization, might still decide to take part. I really 
and sincerely hope so. That is what democracy is about, that is 
what parties should do. 
  [Snow] Now there is already a residual level of violence in 
South Africa. Do you fear that if Inkatha does not take part 
that violence might inevitably escalate? 
  [De Klerk] I think that there might be a definite risk of 
escalation, we will go out of our way firstly to prevent that 
and were it does occur, to handle it firmly so that there can be 
free and fair elections. 
  [Snow] Now, what about the white right-wing. Can you be sure 
after the elections that the Armed Forces in particular, will 
respect the results and will not in any way rally to the cry of 
those on the white right who might want to wreck things? 
  [De Klerk] Our Armed Forces have a very proud history of 
being apolitical, they, especially in terms of the new 
constitution, are safeguarded in that regard. We have excellent 
cooperation, for instance of the Army, with regard to the fusion 
of the Army and other so-called armed forces which fought 
against them for many years, and this fusion is taking place as 
planned and we have the cooperation of the Army. So therefore, 
while there might be individuals and while there might be quite 
a number of individuals in the Army and the police, the 
Conservative Party and the far right, I am convinced that 
discipline will be maintained and the basic loyalty of the 
forces to the state, as opposed to any party, can be and will be 
maintained. 
  [Snow] Can I ask you now about the National Party's campaign 
itself. How do you persuade, particularly black and colored 
people, that the party which after all oppressed them over the 
past 50 years is suddenly going to work in their interests. 
  [De Klerk] Well it is not really so difficult to persuade 
them to do that because they know that it was I, while Mr. 
Mandela was still in jail, who made the speech of 2 February 
1990. They know that even before negotiations with the ANC 
[African National Congress] got off the ground we were still in 
the initial stages. I repealed all discriminatory legislation, 
the group areas act and all the other apartheid laws, and 
wherever I go I am engulfed with warmth and friendship from 
black South Africans, and they come up to me even if they are 
ANC in some instances, and shake my hand and say: We admire you. 
They are friendly toward me, they accept that the National 
Party is a newly National Party. Our congress today has proved 
it, my walkabouts proved it. 
  [Snow] Let me just interrupt you there, because surely it 
would be fair to say that quite a lot of these rallies, as in 
many other countries, are very staged events. People say that 
large numbers of black people in particular, are shipped in to 
give the appearance of a much more multiracial party than really 
exists. 
  [De Klerk] No, some of the meetings which I have, for 
instance when I do, as we call it, a road show. Yes people come 
to a prearranged venue, but much of it is absolutely 
spontaneous. I go, for instance, to a market place -- I walked 
into a vegetable market the other day, nobody expected me, there 
were no posters up, nothing, and I took a mike and I stood up 
and spoke, and there were up to 600 people. They all came to 
shake my hand and I had the chance to spread my message. It was 
not a put-up job at all. 
  [Snow] What then is your realistic expectation of how you 
can 
come out of all this? What sort of percentage do you think you 
are going to get? 
  [De Klerk] I am not quoting percentages, I am saying we are 
working and we are very serious about it. I say it as an old 
campaigner, it is achievable to get the biggest percentage of 
the vote. That does not mean getting more than 50 percent, it 
means getting the biggest percentage out of 100 of the vote -- 
that is first prize, we are working for that, and we truly 
believe that it is achievable. If we can gain some significant 
support from black South Africans, and by the day I am becoming 
more and more convinced that we can, we will be the biggest 
party in South Africa. 
  [Snow] Mr. de Klerk are you in end the greatest pragmatist 
of 
the 20th century, or do you really believe it all? 
  [De Klerk] I really believe it all, I am a realistic 
idealist. I do not walk with my head in the clouds, I have my 
feet firmly on the ground, but I am an optimist and I believe we 
can make South Africa a much better South Africa. I think we 
can unlock it's tremendous potential, and I think there is 
widespread enthusiasm for this vision of the future. 
  [Snow] One is bound to ask somebody who grew up steeped in 
the apartheid idea, who then saw the need for change, whether 
even after this process, you will still find it easy to treat 
black politicians with absolute equality? 
  [De Klerk] I have no problem whatsoever, I have been doing 
it 
for the past years. We opened our party's membership more than 
two years ago to all South Africans. I now have in my 
parliamentary caucus more people of color than white people and 
there is a wonderful spirit of unity at this congress of ours. 
Black and white took hands and spontaneously sang together. 
There is no racism left in the National Party and I have no 
inhibitions whatsoever in associating with them and calling them 
my partners, my colleagues, my brothers. 
  [Snow] Mr. de Klerk, thank you for talking to us.

  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 7 SAPA -- State President F. W. de 
Klerk has accused the African National Congress [ANC] of 
deliberately sidelining the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and its 
leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, SABC [South African 
Broadcasting Corporation] radio news reports. 
  Addressing businessmen in Sandton near Johannesburg on 
Monday, President de Klerk said this was one of the reasons why 
the violence in the country could not be halted. The violence, 
he said, had been largely attributed by the Goldstone Commission 
to hostility between the ANC and the IFP. He castigated both 
organisations, saying their leaders could do more to end the 
violence.

  [Text] Ulundi Feb 6 SAPA--The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
toughened its negotiating stance on Sunday [6 February], saying 
its demands should be treated as a package in further talks with 
the government and the African National Congress [ANC]. 
  After a meeting on Sunday in Ulundi, the policy-making 
Central Committee said not enough progress had been made in the 
trilateral talks to warrant participation in the election since 
its recent special conference. "The progress made in 
negotiations since the meeting...does not yet make it possible 
for the IFP to enter elections," the committee said in a 
statement. 
  The meeting resolved to instruct its negotiators to "further 
negotiate...on the clear understanding the constitutional 
concerns of the IFP hang together as inter-related and 
interlocked fundamental issues." 
  It added failure to negotiate the Freedom Alliance's 
proposed 
amendments to any one clause of the constitution, would have 
adverse implications on all other IFP concerns. 
  Further trilateral talks will take place on Monday in the 
last round of talks ahead of registration of parties for the 
election.

  [Text] Lichtenburg Feb 5 SAPA -- Afrikaner 
Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] (AWB) leader 
Eugene Terreblanche on Saturday [5 February] threw down the 
gauntlet to the African National Congress [ANC], promising 
"total war" if Afrikaners were not given their own republic. 
"Mandela, give us a volkstaat [homeland] or you'll have total 
war in South Africa," the AWB leader said at an Afrikaner 
Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front] (AVF) rally at the 
Lichtenburg showgrounds in the Western Transvaal. The 
400-strong crowd cheered wildly when the AWB leader made his 
threat. 
  Earlier, quoting private security companies, Mr Terreblanche 
said 41 bombs had exploded in the Western Transvaal in the past 
few days. "Professionals are destroying South Africa's railway 
tracks to fight the ANC.... More explosions will occur from 
tonight (Saturday)," he said. 
  In a disparaging reference to the National Party (NP) 
election campaign to gain black votes, Mr Terreblanche said the 
NP had become "a party of kissing (black) girls and garden 
kaffirs". 
  At the same rally AVF leader Tienie Groenewald said, 
evidently contradicting Mr Terreblanche, the AVF would use any 
peaceful means to achieve its goals. Pessimistic about the 
final round of talks between the Freedom Alliance, the 
government and the ANC on Monday, Gen Groenewald said he 
expected no settlement at the end of this negotiation phase. 
The AVF had been told that there would be no more concessions, 
he said. "We now have to face the reality of resistance," he 
said, stopping short of using the term armed resistance. 
  Gen Groenewald conceded the government had made some 
concessions in the latest round of talks, but there had been no 
backing down by the ANC on the powers of regions which were 
unacceptable to the right wing. "But from Monday we will 
systematically put pressure on the ANC and the government to try 
and reach our objectives." 
  The third speaker at the meeting, Conservative Party (CP) 
leader Ferdi Hartzenberg, said during a heavy downpour that the 
CP leadership would meet next Thursday to consider its options 
regarding the April elections. 
  AVF convenor Gen Constand Viljoen, who was scheduled to have 
addressed the rally, did not arrive. No reason for his absence 
was given.

  [Text] The Conservative Party has described as the 
culmination of the government's total capitulation, the visit of 
a high-level Pentagon delegation to help integrate South 
Africa's defense forces. In a statement the party's deputy 
leader, Dr. Willie Snyman, wanted to know which country in the 
world would tolerate a foreign superpower interfering with its 
defense force's internal affairs. He was reacting to an 
announcement that an American assistant defense secretary, Mr. 
Charles Freeman, would lead a 10-member Pentagon team to South 
Africa. The delegation is scheduled to meet representatives of 
the government, the defense force, the Transitional Executive 
Council, the ANC [African National Congress] and other 
organizations.

<F P=106> [Report by Z.B. du Toit] </F>
  [Text] A strange document claiming to be coming from the 
South African Communist Party [SACP], and in which a detailed 
conspiracy is spelled out to establish a communist state in 
South Africa, surfaced late this week and had Transvaal farmers 
fuming. 
  An altercation ensued yesterday between Transvaal 
Agricultural Union [TAU] President Dries Bruwer and the SACP's 
Jeremy Cronin after members of the TAU's general council 
unanimously expressed their opposition to allowing political 
parties on Transvaal farms for their election campaigns. 
  Such action brings Transvaal farmers in conflict with the 
electoral constitution as it will prevent free access by 
political parties to the hundreds of thousands of black voters 
on Transvaal farms. Mr. Bruwer told RAPPORT outright: "If the 
electoral constitution conflicts with law and order, then we 
choose law and order. All hell will break loose should they 
dare to touch one farmer." 
<H5>  Challenge </H5>
  Yesterday Mr. Cronin directed a challenge at Mr. Bruwer to 
publish the document. "There is no such document," he added. 
  Bruwer, convinced of the document's authenticity, faxed it 
to 
RAPPORT. 
  In the document are detailed particulars on how the SACP 
grabbed the opportunity to negotiate with the government in 
order to promote its conspiracy to put into place a communist 
state, and how it is going ahead with these plans. Some of the 
sensitive statements in the document are as follows: 

  -  "We have not as yet altered our objectives. We have said, 
well and good, we will negotiate to reach a few compromises, but 
negotiations will be a form of struggle to weaken the 
government. We looked for ways to weaken its security forces 
while we build up our political force. It is also important for 
us to build up our armed capability. This is the reason for our 
double agenda." 
  -  "Negotiations have become the most important terrain of the 
struggle." 
  -  "The armed struggle has been suspended so as to confuse the 
security forces and give the SACP room to maneuver in the 
confusion that resulted." 
  -  "We have to organize MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- ANC Military 
Wing] more effectively within the National Peacekeeping Force. 
Meanwhile, we must spare no trouble in bringing our weaponry 
into the country." 

<H5>    Two Phases </H5>

  -  The "national democratic revolution" is taking place in 
two phases: The first stage is up to election day and the 
second will come with the introduction of the policy of 
reconstruction to transform South Africa into a workers' state 
and to manipulate the constitution-writing process with the view 
of establishing a socialist South Africa. 
  -  "The armed struggle has always been a 'golden thread' right 
through the national democratic revolutionary phase and will be 
as such during the transitional phase after the election. This 
strategy of a low intensity war in the townships and to arm the 
masses fits in with our strategy." 

<H5>    Authenticity </H5>
  Mr. Bruwer told RAPPORT yesterday he does not doubt the 
authenticity of the document. It has apparently been received 
from someone in the 'intelligence community." The Defense Force 
also has a copy of it, he said. 
  This week he is to see SACP Chairman Joe Slovo about the 
matter, Mr. Bruwer added. "It all means that a party which 
still engages in violence and has a secret agenda has access to 
farms. Anxiety is rife among farm laborers, with tension among 
especially Zulus and others mounting. Political parties now 
want to visit them to campaign for votes, thereby setting the 
scene for unrest and intimidation. Farm laborers are free to 
exercise their political rights, but political parties must not 
come and meddle with us farmers. The electoral constitution is 
draconian." 
<H5>  `Blatant Lies' </H5>
  Yesterday Mr. Cronin said that Mr. Bruwer's allegation that 
the SACP is preparing itself for armed action is a "blatant lie." 
  "This allegation gives rise to the real question: Who 
exactly is preparing for an armed struggle? Over the last six 
months thousands of white farmers have been armed by the Defense 
Force's commando network. Right now it is not the farms of 
Bruwer's members, but the offices of our allies, that are being 
bombed," Mr. Cronin said. 
  At the time of going to press RAPPORT had not yet 
established 
the authenticity of the document, but security experts point out 
that certain elements in the document "do not rhyme with the 
style of the SACP."

  [Text] Durban Feb 6 SAPA--A bloody attack on women and 
children in the southern Natal village of Masunkazane outside 
Richmond early on Sunday [6 February] morning left 12 people 
dead and several injured -- among the dead, a three-year-old boy 
and an 80-year-old pensioner. 
  Natal Police Liaison Officer Captain Henry Budhram said 
about 
20 men armed with AK-47 assault rifles and 12-bore-shotguns had 
attacked seven houses just before dawn. 
  The deceased, which included altogether six children, were: 
Sandile Dlamini, 7, Thuleleni Dlamini, 17, Lalani Dlamini, 65, 
Nonhanla Madondo, 6, Hlompile Madondo, 16, Kwazi Madondo, 3, his 
grandmother Rosaline Madondo, 50, Ester Zaca, 50, her sister 
Zenzele Zaca, 63, Fikilephi Zaca, 17, Nceke Mchunu 50 and Petha 
Mtolo, 80. 
  They all died from gunshot wounds, Capt Budhram said. Police 
have launched an intensive investigation and have blamed the 
ongoing violence between the ANC [African National Congress] and 
Inkatha as the motive for the attack. Some of the houses were 
looted. 
  The Masunkazane community has been devastated by violence 
since 1990 with an ongoing supremacy battle between the ANC and 
Inkatha. Last year alone, 1975 people were killed in the area, 
but peace monitors said the area seemed to have quieted down the 
past few months. 
  ANC members, monitored by peace officials, spent the day 
campaigning 20-km away in Ixopo, and were unaware of the attack. 
However, the ANC media spokesman in the area, Mr Blade Nzimande, 
had been informed by shocked residents. He confirmed the area 
had been relatively peaceful of late, but said in view of the 
Freedom Alliance's [FA] stance towards elections he had been 
expecting trouble. "Its an attempt by the FA to destabilise 
communities to pressurise the ANC and government to accede to 
their constitutional demands," Mr Nzimande said on Sunday night. 
"But to kill women and children is particularly barbaric," he 
added.
