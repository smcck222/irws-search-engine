  [Text] Beijing, January 29 (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman 
of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Committee (CPPCC), said here today that religious 
work in China is facing a new situation as the country is 
shifting to a socialist market economy. 
  Li, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political 
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, made 
the remark at a forum on religious work attended by leaders of 
religious organizations from all over the country. 
  Li Ruihuan called on party and government organizations at 
all levels to further study, better understand and implement the 
party's religious policies. 
  He urged them to help religious organizations as well as 
religious people to solve their actual difficulties and problems 
and deal with religious affairs according to law. 
  Religious organizations should unite and encourage religious 
believers to take an active part in the country's opening up and 
reforms as well as the modernization drive and promote the 
socialist market economy being established in the country, Li 
said. 
  He hoped that religious work departments and religious 
organizations will work together to achieve an even more 
harmonious relationship and to deal with religious affairs even 
better.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Lo Feng (5012 2800): "Ding Guangen </F>
Relayed Deng Xiaoping's Instructions to Political Bureau at the 
End of Last Year--Speed Up Economic Development"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong 29 Jan (LIEN HO PAO)--A CPC high-ranking 
figure disclosed that Deng Xiaoping indirectly aired his views 
at the end of last year on the "relationship between being fast 
or slow" in economic growth, while demanding that the economic 
growth rate not be slowed. He believed that the annual GNP 
growth rate should not be under 12 percent. However, the State 
Council has stipulated the GNP growth rate for this year to be 9 
percent. 
  Deng Xiaoping had not summoned Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, or Zhu 
Rongji since July last year. His remarks were made to Ding 
Guangen, his bridge partner, who relayed the message to the 
central Political Bureau. 
  Ding Guangen said that recently, Comrade Xiaoping had aired 
his views on economic growth rate being fast or slow; he 
believed that should the economic growth be too fast, it would 
inevitably bring side effects, such as inflation and an 
imbalance between supply and demand. 
  Deng Xiaoping indicated that economic growth should be 
viewed 
in a dialectical way; people should not always be scared of 
inflation surfacing and an imbalance between supply and demand 
whenever a fast growth rate is advocated. 
  Deng Xiaoping stressed: "Only with a fast growth rate will 
it be possible for our economy to possess a solid foundation, 
ensure the employment rate, and reduce social contradictions." 
  It has been learned that earlier last year, Deng Xiaoping 
said that we must have an annual 12 percent economic growth 
rate; otherwise, China will never reach the level of a 
moderately developed country. 
  The source said that Deng Xiaoping's remarks had an "obvious 
target" because some members of the central authorities 
vigorously advocated slowing the economic growth rate. At the 
economic work conference last year, the GNP was stipulated to be 
9 percent. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji's target was 9 to 10 percent 
and he believed that this index would ensure economic growth 
while maintaining social stability. 
  In recent years, Deng Xiaoping has vigorously advocated 
speeding up the growth rate. The precise reason why he made the 
southern inspection tour in the spring of 1992 was that he was 
unhappy about the dullness and seeming stagnation of the 
three-year improvement and consolidation. What he mainly 
required was that the economy "mounted a new plane every several 
years." 
  The essence of Deng Xiaoping's current talks did not go 
beyond those he delivered during his southern inspection tour in 
1992. Although Deng Xiaoping was repeating his own words, they 
had a particularly clear target at this specific moment. The 
leading members in office were very sensitive about it but they 
have not publicly propagated Deng's remarks as of today lest 
they should rekindle the just dampened local government craze 
for investment, which would then become even more difficult to 
control. 
  It has also been learned that at a recent high-ranking 
conference in Beijing, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji declared that the 
tasks for macroeconomic regulation and control had not been 
completed; currently, it is still necessary to reduce the 
momentum of inflation, the trend to widen the capital 
construction scope, and the volume of bank loans and money 
issued. The main task for 1994 is a soft landing and it is 
primarily necessary to do a good job of reform. 
  Local governments were all drawing up their plans for 
dealing 
with the central reform measures, especially for banking and tax 
reform. It is said that Guangdong and Jiangsu already have 
their well thought out plans, whereas other localities are 
sending personnel to Guangdong to learn from its experiences by 
taking advantage of extending greetings for the Spring Festival. 
  The source said that Deng Xiaoping does not have any current 
plan to conduct a "second inspection tour" down south to 
Guangdong; nevertheless, it is thought that he will make an 
appearance and say something during the Spring Festival to set 
the principle and guidelines for the National People's Congress 
and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference 
upcoming in March.

  [Text] Fuzhou, January 28 (XINHUA) -- East China's Fujian, 
Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Anhui Provinces are co-operating in 
jointly developing the local economy. 
  According to statistics, nine prefectures and cities in 
these 
provinces concluded contracts between them on 189 economic and 
technical co-operative projects last year. 
  They introduced funds totalling 136 million yuan, exchanged 
245 skilled people, generated an additional output value 
totalling 13.38 million yuan and concluded a trans-regional 
trade volume amounting to 530 million yuan in 1993. 
  This co-operation began in 1986 under the principle of 
"mutual help and benefit". The areas have so far reached 
contracts on 1,325 economic and technical co-operation projects, 
generated an additional output value of more than four billion 
yuan and exchanged or recruited about 10,000 talented people. 
  At present, the annual industrial and agricultural output 
value of the region is 73.3 billion yuan, five times that of 
eight years ago. 
  In addition, the region has opened 140 markets and improved 
transportation facilities.

<F P=106> [By reporters Xu Jun (1776 6511) and Fan Sancheng (5400 0005 </F>
2052): "Mountainous Areas Are the Key to Beijing's Endeavor To 
Achieve a Fairly Comfortable Standard of Living"] 
  [Excerpts] Chen Xitong, secretary of the municipal party 
committee; and Li Qiyan, mayor of Beijing; went to the Fanzipai 
Village in the remote mountainous area of Miyun County to 
conduct investigation and study and to give work guidance on 6 
January. They emphasized that mountainous areas are the key to 
whether Beijing can achieve a fairly comfortable standard of 
living. All trades and professions in the municipality should 
support the development of mountainous areas, visit these areas 
more often, and make contributions to their development. 
  Fanzipai Village used to be the poorest village in Beijing's 
suburban mountainous areas. Chen Xitong has come to the village 
seven times since early 1990, when Chen Xitong came to the 
village to help it shake off poverty. Chen Xitong and Li Qiyan 
arrived in the village by a minibus very early in the morning. 
They first listened to reports given by Li Yonghua, secretary 
of the village party committee; and Zhang Lianyin, head of Miyun 
County. 
  Fanzipai Village again reached new heights in development in 
various trades in 1993. Its industrial and agricultural output 
value was 30 million yuan, up 50 percent from the preceding 
year; its per capita income was 1,150 yuan, up 3 times from the 
290 yuan of 1989; output of haw was 1.22 million kg, up 100 
percent; and number of goats in stock was 540, which enabled 50 
households to earn more than 1,000 yuan. [passage omitted] 
  Chen Xitong gave a speech to affirm the great progress 
achieved by the village and urge it to make continuous efforts 
to tap its potential. He said: Miyun used to be a 
revolutionary base area during the revolutionary war years. 
After liberation, Miyun people made tremendous and special 
contributions to the capital by building the Miyun reservoir. 
It would be unfair to the people of Miyun County if we did not 
help its mountainous areas to promote their economy. 
  Chen Xitong pointed out: Mountainous areas are the key to 
whether Beijing can achieve a fairly comfortable standard of 
living. Beijing's mountainous areas have a population of 1.5 
million and 60 economically less developed villages, thus 
lagging far behind the plain areas. If the economy of the 
mountainous areas is not promoted, and many villages and 
households remain poor, Beijing will have a big difficulty in 
achieving a fairly comfortable standard of living. 
  He emphasized: All trades and professions in the 
municipality should support the development of mountainous 
areas, which is their duty and an honor permitting no turning 
back. Instead of visiting advanced localities and units or 
attending parties, their leaders should visit mountainous areas 
more often to conduct investigation and study to learn about the 
situation and help solve specific problems. All departments, 
committees, and offices of the municipal party committee and 
government and large and medium-sized enterprises should also 
visit mountainous areas more often, not just during Spring 
Festival, to help solve problems together. Mountainous areas 
continue to be the largest problem in Beijing's endeavor to 
achieve a fairly comfortable standard of living. If everyone 
makes concerted efforts and contributions together, mountainous 
areas will be developed more rapidly. This is a task we should 
fulfill if Beijing is to achieve a fairly comfortable standard 
of living three years ahead of schedule. It should be given 
wide publicity in the municipality. 
  Chen Xitong said: Development of the mountainous areas is an 
important part of the development of the capital. We should 
make more reports to the central departments and welcome them to 
develop the capital with us and to support and help the 
development of the mountainous areas. We should also establish 
more ties with other provinces and municipalities and welcome 
them to help the capital in developing mountainous areas. In 
short, we should mobilize the forces and positive factors from 
all quarters to accelerate the development of Beijing's 
mountainous areas. 
  He pointed out: The municipal rural work conference held not 
long ago was a very important conference. Mountainous areas 
should make particular efforts to conscientiously implement the 
new ideas and new moves put forward at the conference and, on 
the premise that laws and plans are abided by, further relax 
policies. It is a good thing, not a capitalist thing, for 
households in mountainous areas to earn 1 million or even 10 
million yuan. We should relax policies resolutely and act 
bravely. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In his government work report to the Second Session 
of the Eighth Provincial People's Congress, Governor Chen 
Shineng stressed: Agriculture, the rural areas, and the 
peasants have always been the fundamental issue that has an 
important bearing on Guizhou's overall economic development. 
Agriculture must be a priority in economic work. 
  He said: Rural economic structural adjustment must proceed 
on the basis of maintaining a stable increase in grain 
production with a focus on the development of township and town 
enterprises, animal husbandry, and highly efficient industrial 
crops. 
  Governor Chen Shineng continued: Township and town 
enterprises should implement the policy of major development and 
major improvement and ensure a 30 percent annual growth rate 
while striving for 40 percent. This year, the province will 
build 20 small industrial zones for township and town 
enterprises' development. In animal husbandry, aquatic 
breeding, and crop planting, we should develop pig breeding step 
by step, vigorously develop the breeding of cows and sheep, step 
up the development of eel breeding, and explore the development 
of all kinds of industrial crops. In two years, we should 
strive to raise the proportion of the output value of animal 
husbandry and aquatic breeding to the gross agricultural output 
value to more than 30 percent. In industrial crops, we should 
develop flue-cured tobacco, tea oil, tea, and Chinese medical 
herbs. 
  Governor Chen Shineng pointed out: In the course of 
improving large and medium state-owned enterprises, we should 
boldly develop the nonstate economic sectors and take this as a 
strategic point in establishing a market economic structure and 
stimulating Guizhou's economic development, so as to gradually 
form a pattern for multiple economic sectors, equal competition, 
and common development. 
  Chen Shineng said: Beginning this year, we will put nonstate 
economic sectors in the economic and social development program 
and will determine a clear development objective and policy. 
With the exception of those that have been specifically 
stipulated by the state, restrictions will be lifted on 
operational scale, methods, and scopes of nonstate-owned 
economic sectors. We will support individual industrial and 
commercial households in carrying out border trade, as long as 
they have the necessary conditions; in building joint-venture or 
cooperative enterprises; and in doing business or building 
enterprises abroad. Financial departments should allocate funds 
for the development of individual and nonstate economic sectors, 
which are entitled to equal treatment as state-owned enterprises 
and township and town enterprises. We should list the 
operational sites of individual industrial and commercial 
households in the urban construction program. Wherever 
possible, we should build all kinds of professional markets and 
small commodities markets and actively assist nonstate 
enterprises that have certain potential and good foundations in 
expanding their scale of operations, upgrading their facilities, 
and raising their standards. We will encourage redundant 
personnel as well as scientific and technological personnel in 
institutions to engage in civilian-run enterprises. There are 
currently more than 300,000 individual industrial and commercial 
households in the province, with registered capital of 1 billion 
yuan. There are more than 3,000 nonstate enterprises, with 
50,000 personnel and registered capital of 400 million yuan, and 
there are 685 three-capital enterprises, with registered capital 
of $1.1 billion. The output value of these nonstate economic 
sectors accounts for 33.5 percent of the gross industrial output 
value, and their sales volume accounts for 63.1 percent of the 
total market sales volume.

<F P=106> ["SUNDAY POST exclusive"] </F>
  [Text] Mainlanders who gave up everything for a place on 
the ill-fated freighter Golden Venture and a new life in the 
United States seem certain to end their journey inside Chinese 
detention centres, the SUNDAY MORNING POST has discovered. The 
118 Golden Venture illegal immigrants [IIs] deported to China 
nine days ago are being held in Public Security Bureau (PSB) 
offices in Fuzhou city. If their families cannot pay fines of 
up to 20,000 yuan (HK$17,760 [Hong Kong dollars])--a massive sum 
by normal mainland standards--they will be sent to re-education 
centres. 
  Receipts obtained by the SUNDAY MORNING POST bear the stamps 
of the Fujian Provincial Government and the Frontier Armed 
Police Force of Changle County, a small administrative area 40 
kilometres from Fuzhou. They show that the authorities fined 
the illegal immigrants separately and a senior re-education 
centre official in the Fujian capital admitted they would be 
jailed if the cash was not paid. 
  The Golden Venture, with 286 illegal immigrants on board, 
ran 
aground off New York last June. Six mainlanders died when they 
jumped from the ship in a desperate bid to escape from U.S. 
officials. Many claimed they were refugees escaping the 
strictures of China's one-child-per-family policy, a plea backed 
by a U.S. federal judge last week when he ruled it provided 
sufficient grounds for asylum in the U.S.. But his decision 
came too late for the first batch of Golden Venture illegal 
immigrants, and news of their harsh treatment seems certain to 
fuel the heated debate on human rights abuses on the mainland, 
and heighten demands for the U.S. not to renew China's Most 
Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status. 
  Raising cash to pay the fines demanded by the authorities 
has 
already taken a high toll on some families. The wife of one 
illegal immigrant said they raised the 20,000 yuan for the fine 
by borrowing from a loan-shark--but the PSB refused to accept it 
because her husband, Cheng Yiulin, was a second offender, and 
said he must spend a year in a re-education centre. 
  Mrs Cheng, 26, said her husband had now been detained for a 
week by the PSB. "They beat him up and now he has a stomach 
illness," she said. "They also said he would be sent to the 
re-education centre for a year." Pausing to light a 
candle--their old, brick-built house has no electricity--she 
continued: "My mother was very upset after hearing the news. 
She hanged herself on Monday." The family tragedy has spread 
even further--her mother-in-law has suffered a nervous breakdown. 
  Cheng Yiulin's journey on the Golden Venture was the second 
time he had made an illegal bid to get to the United States. 
His first attempt was last January with another in-famous II 
ship, the East Wood. More than 524 Chinese were on the East 
Wood when food and water supplies ran out in mid-Pacific. The 
U.S. coast guard stopped the vessel as it neared Hawaii last 
February and the Chinese were eventually sent home. Mr Cheng 
was then fined 20,000 yuan, a sum which equalled the total 
family income for five years. He received a similar fine when 
he was deported by the U.S.. 
  Mrs Cheng said they had paid the first penalty by borrowing 
money from loan-sharks, but when it became obvious that they 
would never clear the debt her husband decided to make a second 
bid to reach the U.S. and make his fortune. "We could not go on 
repaying the loan for the rest of our lives," she said. "The 
only way out was for him to go to America." 
  With three children aged seven, six and four, his distraught 
wife said all she was praying for now was a family reunion. 
Even the children understood what was happening in the family. 
Asked where her "Daddy" was, seven-year-old Dingshui said: "He 
is now in jail. I miss him." Mrs Cheng cannot even see her 
husband because she does not have the cash--"The PSB charges 30 
yuan for each visit," she said. 
  The Chinese Government promised before the illegal 
immigrants 
were sent home that they would not be imprisoned or harshly 
punished. Fines would be no more than 5,000 yuan, they said, 
adding the returnees would be lectured and released. But 
receipts shown to the SUNDAY MORNING POST and issued by Fujian 
Provincial Government and the Fujian Frontier Armed Police 
Force, reveal that at least one mainlander was charged 11,000 
yuan. 
  The director of Rujiang Re-education Centre, Mr Liu, makes 
no 
secret of the fact the immigrants are jailed. "They (IIs) have 
to do some work, there is no reason to lock them up everyday," 
Mr Liu said. "The time spent in re-education is not fixed, it 
depends mainly on their performance." 
  It is believed most returning boat people are held in the 
high-walled Rujiang camp, which is in a remote area about 20 
kilometres from Fuzhou. And it is expected those from the 
Golden Venture will end up at the camp as well. Mr Liu refused 
to say how many boat people were in the jail and how they fared 
once inside. However, it was learned that about 1,000 IIs are 
being held in the centre and that they have to work on 
construction, farming and the production of shoes. 
  The SUNDAY MORNING POST witnessed some inmates working on 
the 
roof of a building, and Fuzhou Labour and Education Bureau 
lorries carrying footwear material into the camp. Sources say 
the camp's main output is shoe soles which goes to Taiwanese 
enterprises. Families of the illegal immigrants say they can 
only visit their relatives once a month. Some of the IIs will 
be sent to the Shui Tao re-education centre in Fuzhou. Camp 
director, Mr Wang said: "It is normal that they have to work."

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Wang Nan: "Clinton, FED Collide Over </F>
Inflation"] 
  [Text] Washington, January 31 (XINHUA) -- With greater 
economic buoyancy across the nation, the Clinton administration 
and the Federal Reserve (FED) appeared to be on a collision 
course about inflation. 
  However, raising short-term interest rates to keep inflation 
on the ropes is something that may happen eventually, observers 
here said. 
  Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, at today's hearing 
of the congressional joint economic committee, pointed to 
"latent instabilities" on prices and suggested lowing interest 
rates to contain them. 
  In response, President Bill Clinton said the only thing he 
agreed to was "there is no evidence that inflation is coming 
back", and "there is no need" to raise interest rates, 
especially the long-term ones. 
  It is not difficult to understand why the White House is so 
concerned about the mere mentioning of interest rates. Last 
year, the interest rates dipped to historic lows, propelling the 
economic boom. 
  The revival was partly driven by interest-sensitive sectors, 
like house construction, consumer spending on big-ticket items 
and business investment, which climbed by 15 percent in the 
fourth quarter of 1993. 
  Home sales, stimulated by mortgage rates, the lowest in more 
than 25 years, bolstered purchases of furniture and appliances, 
while firms increased outlays on equipment and commercial real 
estate recovered from depression. 
  Consumer prices index, meanwhile, edged down to a paltry 2.7 
percent last year, the smallest reading since the early 1970s. 
The recovery is hailed as a model expansion with no 
inflationary growth. 
  However, as Chairman Greenspan saw it, these are not good 
indicators for "emerging troubles". "Higher price inflation 
tends to surface rather late in the business cycle," he said. 
"They are rarely visible until relatively far advanced." 
  "The challenge of monetary policy is to detect such latent 
instabilities in time to contain them," the chairman stressed, 
pointing to the weak labor market and the scant signs of 
improvement in exports. 
  Since 1987, Greenspan has been the chairman of the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve systems, which contains 12 
regional banks and has some controls over short-term interest 
rates. 
  The President, with no right to influence the independent 
decisions of FED, has power to name one of FED's governors but 
cannot remove any of them. 
  Short-term interest rate is represented by the federal fund 
rate, which is the interest banks charge each other on overnight 
loans. The rate has been staying at three percent for more than 
a year. 
  Credit tightening will also has impact on long-term interest 
rates, such as the 10-year and 30-year treasury bonds and 
conventional mortgage rates, which have been around six to seven 
percent. 
  With the recession in 1990-91, the Federal Reserve has cut 
short- term interest rates to record lows to spur bank lending 
since 1989. The FED refused to raise interest rates which might 
choke off growth. 
  With the economy growing at a robust 5.9 percent in the last 
quarter of 1993, many observers have already noted that the 
central bank might act soon to raise interest rates and hold 
inflationary pressure in check. 
  The Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to meet later 
this week and will submit its crucial report on interest rates 
late next month. Greenspan's speech today served to set the 
stage for future actions. 
  "We want the economy to grow in a very stable, solid way, 
and 
obviously, low interest rates are critical to that. We've got 
to keep interest rates down so that people can afford to borrow 
money," said President Clinton.

<F P=106> [By Xiao Wang: "China Not to Blame for Its Trade Deficit </F>
with US"] 
  [Text] The United States should not list China as a major 
threat to its foreign trade balance, a senior Chinese economist 
said last week. 
  "It is Japan and Western Europe that the US Government and 
businesses should square up to," said Zhou Shijian, Vice 
President of the Institute of International Trade Research at 
the Ministry of Foreign Trade and economic Co-operation. 
  He attributed the US's ballooning trade deficit mainly to 
the 
country's lacklustre competition with Japan and Western Europe 
in capital-and technology-intensive projects. 
  "The deficit with China is the result of a reshaped US 
industrial structure, which encourages the import of 
labour-intensive products from the country," he explained. 
  The US would have even higher costs if it reduced such 
imports and relied on domestic production, he added. 
  "The imports, although producing trade deficits, help the US 
to direct more of its resources to high technology development," 
he said. 
  The US has moved a large chunk of its labour-intensive 
projects overseas since the end of World War II to take 
advantage of cheap local labour. 
  "This shift can only be conducive to the American economy," 
Zhou said. 
  A similar advantage arises from the US policy to import 
natural resources such as oil, rather than to use its own. 
  Although the imports fuel its trade deficit, they 
effectively 
preserve the US's own natural resource reserves, Zhou argued. 
  It is estimated that, each year, the US consumes about 30 
percent of the world's natural resources, including 26.6 percent 
of oil production. 
  "As the world's second largest oil producer, the US could 
well reduce its imports by exploring for more domestic crude oil 
and natural gas. But this runs counter to the US policy to use 
foreign oil first," Zhou pointed out. 
  To cut the trade surplus with the US, Japan has proposed to 
import oil from Alaska, but the offer was rejected by the US. 
  In short, the imports of large amounts of resources and 
daily 
consumer goods form an integral part of the US economy and 
support its economic growth, Zhou concluded. 
  "What poses the real threat to the American economy is the 
competition from Japan and Westem Europe in such high-tech areas 
as computers, automobiles, silicon semiconductors and so on," he 
said. 
  By 1992, Japanese-made sedan cars had dominated about 
one-fourth of the American market, pushing the US Big 
Three--General Motors, Ford and Chrysler--to order intermittent 
layoffs. 
  "The US has to come up with a serious strategy for this 
problem," Zhou said. 
  As a result of teetering productivity in the 1970s to 1980s, 
the US economy stagnated. 
  Indeed, US productivity in the manufacturing sector has 
trailed that of most Western countries, a fact which eventually 
led to the US's first trade deficit in 1971 since 1888 A rising 
US dollar has also contributed much to the country's growing 
deficit, Zhou said. 
  As for the US's claims of a huge deficit with China, he 
said, 
the figures are bloated. 
  What with more Japanese, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwanese and 
South Korean companies investing in China, their trade surpluses 
with the US have been concealed and unjustifiably calculated 
into the Chinese accounts. 
  These companies create huge margins of profits by exporting 
their Chinese-made products to the US. 
  But the US regards all this profit as rolling into China's 
pockets, because US trade statistics are based on a product's 
country of origin. 
  "In fact, more than two-thirds of the US deficit since the 
1980s has been caused by direct and indirect trade with Japanese 
companies," Zhou pointed out. 
  Similarly, the US has calculated much of the profits earned 
in China by Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwanese investors as China's 
revenues. 
  China actually has received only processing fees from the 
companies financed by these regions, Zhou said. 
  Foreign-invested enterprises account for more than 20 
percent 
of China's annual export volumes. 
  Much of their exports have ended up in the US market, 
inflating China's trade surplus with the US. 
  Moreover, many US multinationals, such as Nike, ship most of 
their Chinese-made products back to the US, with revenues lining 
American pockets. 
  But the US regards these sales as China's exports, Zhou 
pointed out. 
  "If the US had clearer statistics for the internal trade of 
its own multinationals, we could say that the US enjoys a trade 
surplus, not a trade deficit, at present," he said. 
  Meanwhile, the US does not include its income from arms 
sales-- valued at an average of $20 billion to $30 billion each 
year--into its trade figures.

<F P=106> [By Xiao Pei: "Unofficial Channels Work for MFN"] </F>
  [Text] China's main non-governmental economic organization 
will gear up its lobbying to secure American extension of 
China's most-favoured-nation (MFN) status. 
  "We will try to win the support of US companies through non- 
governmental channels," said Zheng Hongye, Chairman of the China 
Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT). 
  Last year more than 300 big American corporations demanded 
that the US Government extend China's MFN status without 
political conditions. 
  The US Government will decide whether to extend China's 
status for another year in June. 
  "To keep the trade status will not be an easy task," Zheng 
admitted. 
  "Although there will be twists and turns on this issue, we 
are confident that China will retain the status." 
  No country can ignore China's huge potential market, he 
said. 
China's total imports reached $103,95 billion last year. 
  Zheng said that the US Government should solve the issue of 
China's status once and for all because it affects not only 
Sino- American economic ties but also political relations. 
  This year CCPIT will intensify its non-governmental economic 
and trade exchanges and co-operative work with Western countries. 
  Meanwhile, CCPIT will actively try to set up economic ties 
with countries that have no diplomatic relations with China, 
Zheng said, A business delegation is now visiting Latin American 
countries, including Paraguay and Honduras, to improve mutual 
understanding. 
  Promoting economic co-operation between the mainland and 
Taiwan is one of CCPIT's priorities this year, Zheng said. 
  Last year CCPIT hosted 15 Taiwan delegations comprising more 
than 300 businessmen. 
  Although people from many circles on the mainland have 
visited Taiwan businessmen are still not allowed to enter the 
island. Zheng said CCPIT will try to arrange the first visit by 
a mainland business delegation to Taiwan sometime this year. 
  CCPIT also plans to hold a mainland commodities exhibition 
in 
Taiwan and invite Taiwanese companies to attend trade fairs on 
the mainland.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan. 29 (YONHAP) -- China and Russia 
shared the opinion that it is vital for both South and North 
Korea not to have nuclear weapons in order to maintain peace and 
stability in the Korean peninsula, Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev says. 
  Kozyrev, who is on a visit to China from Wednesday, held a 
press conference on Friday in Beijing before leaving for 
Shenzhen and said that the North Korean nuclear problem was 
discussed during his talks with Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen. 
  He and Qian confirmed again their countries' opposition to 
the possession of nuclear weapons both by North and South Korea, 
he said. 
  Kozyrev said they are watching the situation on the Korean 
peninsula and that the principle of nuclear nonproliferation 
should be maintained for world peace and stability. 
  He said Russia and China should help solve the North Korean 
nuclear crisis. 
  There is the least possibility right now of war breaking out 
in the Asia-Pacific region since the Second World War, he said, 
but there still are chances of disputes among nations in the 
area. 
  He added that the positions of Russia and China on North 
Korea are very similar. 
  Kozyrev also said that he discussed with Qian ways to 
strengthen friendly and economic cooperation and to promote 
bilateral relations. 
  He hinted that he has discussed with Qian on ways of 
military 
cooperation between their two nations, but did not elaborate.

<F P=106> [By reporter Jiang Jun (1203 6511); Beijing XINHUA Domestic </F>
Service in Chinese at 0921 GMT on 30 January transmits a service 
message canceling the following item] 
  [Text] Beijing, 30 Jan (XINHUA) -- This reporter has 
learned from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation that China continued extending economic and 
technical aid to some developing countries in 1993 within its 
ability, a positive move in developing friendly cooperative 
relations with Third World nations. 
  It is reported that according to new aid agreements it 
signed 
last year with 61 countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and 
the South Pacific, China will implement 272 economic and 
technical aid projects in 72 [as received] recipient nations, of 
which 77 are turnkey projects, 113 are technical cooperation 
projects and cooperation projects of other types, and 82 are 
preconstruction projects. All of these projects have been 
proceeding satisfactorily. 
  To meet the economic restructuring and development plans of 
recipient nations, China will open wholly foreign-owned and 
jointly owned enterprises as well as leasing firms in foreign 
countries through economic and technical assistance channels. 
Forty-five such projects were explored and discussed with 24 
recipient nations last year, resulting in the signing of 12 
agreements between enterprises on both sides. China also 
offered over 50 aid programs for general goods and materials to 
41 countries to help them solve production problems, meet 
certain needs for their people's livelihood, and overcome 
difficulties caused by natural disasters. 
  In cooperation with UN development agencies, China actively 
participated in technical cooperation projects among developing 
countries in 1993, offering a host of wide-ranging aid programs. 
Among them were 23 China-sponsored short-term practical 
technical training courses in food, aquaculture, agricultural 
machinery, and small hydropower, in which more than 230 
technicians from 46 developing countries were trained. 
  It has been learned that, in the future, while continuing 
its 
efforts to extend economic and technical assistance to foreign 
countries, China will undergo reforms in foreign aid work, 
primarily the following: focus on projects that help recipient 
nations develop small and medium-sized production units with 
local demands and resources and that train personnel; in 
promoting direct cooperation between PRC enterprises and those 
of recipient nations, help them develop their national economies 
while integrating bilateral and multilateral economic and trade 
ties and promoting better cooperation between governments; and 
further perfect foreign-aid administration that emphasizes 
standardized and scientific management.

  [Text] Washington, January 31 (XINHUA) -- The United 
States today endorsed a threat by the UN to use air power to 
protect peacekeepers in two important towns in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Meanwhile, President Bill Clinton met with visiting German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, trying to strike a Western consensus on 
how to deal with the two-year-old ethnic war in the former 
Yugoslav republic. 
  UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said in a letter 
Friday [28 January] that he had instructed top UN officials to 
actively plan to open the Tuzla airport for relief supplies and 
to replace Canadian troops at Srebrenica with Dutch peacekeepers. 
  "We've endorsed that report," said Warren Christopher, the 
secretary of state. "That could lead to the use of air power if 
there's not an agreement." 
  One administration official was quoted by the ASSOCIATED 
PRESS as saying that Washington could seek tough UN sanctions 
against Croatia similar to those Serbia is now suffering. 
  Top on the agenda during Kohl's meetings with Clinton 
included Bosnia, but the German chancellor disclosed little 
specifics. 
  "We talked about a number of possibilities that I wouldn't 
want to make public just yet," Kohl said at a news conference. 
  A White House statement said the two leaders discussed "a 
range of international and bilateral issues, including 
developments in Russia, Ukraine, Central Europe, Bosnia and the 
Middle East." 
  "They agreed on the need for vigorous follow-up on NATO 
summit decisions," the statement said. 
  The Bosnian Serbs, Croats and Muslims will resume talks in 
Geneva, Switzerland, on February 10. 
  While France urges the United States to exert pressure on 
the 
Bosnia Muslims to reach a peace agreement with the Serbs and 
Croats, Washington has stressed all along that no peace 
settlement should be imposed on the warring sides. 
  The U.S. is unwilling to dispatch ground troops to Bosnia 
unless all three sides reach a peace accord in good faith. 
  Clinton won support today from Kohl on that front. 
  Kohl said he was against imposing a settlement on the 
warring 
parties and intervening with NATO ground troops. 
  That would lead to "blood bath" and "more traumatic and more 
tragic" results, Kohl said.

"A Just Cause Enjoys Abundant Support"] 
  [Text] Buenos Aires, 25 Jan (RENMIN RIBAO)--It was shortly 
after 2200 on 25 January. The 19th meeting of the International 
Union for Protection of Nature and Natural Resources, held at 
the Sheraton Hotel in Buenos Aires, began to discuss the 
so-called motion on Tibet. 
  In his speech, delivered on the morning of 24 January, the 
Chinese representative strongly urged the meeting to cancel the 
motion on the Tibet issue put forward by Australia's Wilderness 
Society, for it contradicted fact and international law. This 
evening, the Chinese representative was the first speaker. He 
reminded members of the union, above all state members of the 
union, to note that "this shortest motion, which in fact does 
not have any suggestions, is only a political petition; it views 
Tibet as a country and preaches the independence of Tibet. This 
is an action which violates international law because the United 
Nations recognizes Tibet as an inseparable part of Chinese 
territory." The Chinese representative pointed out that the 
alleged "rapid destruction of environment in Tibet," mentioned 
in the motion, is not in accordance with the facts. 
  Thereafter, the representatives of the Norwegian, Pakistani, 
and Belgian state members, the latter representing the European 
Community, spoke. They pointed out that "what is mentioned in 
this motion involves China's internal affair, and is a political 
matter," "not a matter for the union." Therefore they were 
opposed to the motion. The representative of the Australian 
state member was also opposed to the motion, saying that "this 
is a matter which involves state sovereignty." 
  These righteous speeches made the motion sponsor feel 
uneasy. 
The representative of Australia's Wilderness Society falsely 
claimed that "according to the data provided by the exiled 
Tibetan government, the number of forests in Tibet has greatly 
decreased, the human rights of `natives' have been seriously 
infringed, and the environment in Tibet has been seriously 
destroyed." He still stubbornly adhered to his original motion. 
Thereafter, a representative of an environmental protection 
organization from New Zealand pretended to be very solemn when 
reading a so-called document which said that "politically, Tibet 
has no human rights, and its natural environment has been 
destroyed." 
  The Chinese representative pointed out in his speech that 
the 
meeting of the union is not a political forum for discussing 
human rights, and that "if the motion sponsor is interested, we 
can provide him with the white paper published by China on 
sovereignty over Tibet and the human rights situation there." 
"We have a lot of data to illustrate that Tibet's environmental 
protection is the best in China." The Chinese representative 
pointed out, tit-for-tat, that "Tibetans are not so-called 
`natives,' they are the masters of Tibet and account for an 
absolute majority of the population in Tibet. What has been 
mentioned by the motion sponsor is totally not in accordance 
with fact..." 
  The chairman of the meeting decided to put the motion to a 
vote. An absolute majority of state and governmental 
organization members, as well as nongovernmental organization 
members, voted against it. The so-called motion on Tibet issue 
was rejected by the meeting in this way. 
  A just cause enjoys abundant support; an unjust cause finds 
scant support. Obviously, one cannot wins hearts and minds if 
he attempts to use international forums to achieve the aim of 
dividing China.

  [Text] A Hong Kong businessman held incommunicado for more 
than 30 months in China has been released after intervention by 
the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, sources said last night. 
  Chong Kwee-sung, who was detained in 1991 by Zhengzhou 
Public 
Security officials in Shenzhen, was allowed to leave a detention 
centre on Saturday. 
  He is now resting in a hotel in Zhengzhou, central China. 
  It was not clear when Mr Chong would be allowed to return to 
the territory because the Chinese authorities are yet to return 
his travel documents. He is holding a home visit permit. 
  It is understood that a relative has already met Mr Chong in 
Zhengzhou, for the first time in 2-1/2 years. 
  Mr Chong's release was confirmed yesterday when he contacted 
his Hong Kong employers. He was also able to speak to his 
family in the American state of Oregon. 
  There was no official reason for his release. Zhengzhou 
police issued a certificate which said that Mr Chong was freed 
"after the completion of investigations". 
  The SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST reported last month that Mr 
Chong had started a hunger strike to protest against his long 
detention in China without trial. 
  His plight was brought to the attention of Hong Kong and 
Macao Affairs Office Director Lu Ping by Hong Kong-based 
lobbyist John Kamm last October. 
  When Mr Kamm returned to Beijing last month, he had a 
two-hour session with Mr Lu's deputy, Chen Ziying, as Mr Lu was 
in Shenzhen at that time. 
  Mr Chong was taken away in August 1991 by Zhengzhou police, 
who claimed that he was responsible for a commercial dispute 
involving the Central China International Economic and Trading 
Corp in the city.

  [Text] Beijing, 29 Jan (XINHUA) -- A spokesman of the 
Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council today made a 
statement on Taiwan's allowing officials to take part in 
exchange activities on the mainland in a private capacity. He 
pointed out: In recent years, nongovernment exchanges between 
the two sides of the strait have become increasingly active. 
Exchange activities of various kinds and forms have taken place 
constantly on both sides of the strait. Those exchanges and 
contacts have enhanced understanding and affection [gan qing 
1949 1906] between people of the two sides. They are conducive 
to developing relations between the two sides, and the good 
results will benefit both sides. 
  He said: In past exchange activities, a small number of 
officials among the Taiwan authorities had come to the mainland 
to take part in exchange activities in a private capacity. We 
have always taken a attitude welcoming such activities. 
According to a recent report by Taiwan newspapers, the Taiwan 
authorities will relax restrictions and allow Taiwan officials 
to go to the mainland for cultural and educational exchange 
activities in the name of academic or mass organizations. We 
express our welcoming of this decision by the Taiwan 
authorities. Meanwhile, we hope that officials of the Taiwan 
side, when they come to the mainland for exchange or other 
nongovernment activities in a private capacity, will first 
contact the Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation and the 
mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits 
so as to let concerned departments on the mainland provide 
necessary asssitance. This will enable such exchange activities 
to be conducted in a smooth and proper manner and to achieve 
good results. 
  The spokesman of the Taiwan Affairs Office said: We hope the 
Taiwan authorities will adopt a similar attitude to promote 
exchanges between the two sides of the strait, further relax 
restrictions, and allow mainland officials to go to Taiwan to 
take part in exchange activities in a personal or private 
capacity.

  [Text] Hong Kong, 26 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Ku 
Chen-fu, chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation, 
responded to the issue of direct flights to fixed destinations 
on both sides of the strait, a issue which has recently drawn 
widespread attention in Taiwan; he said that the Taiwan 
authorities must have a policy on the issue, and must not avoid 
talking about it. Whereas the Hong Kong issue is also an urgent 
one, and the government should all the more derive a policy as 
soon as possible, and inform industrial and commercial circles 
at an early date so that they can make preparations. 
  Ku Chen-fu pointed out that based on the future economic 
policy of Taiwan, establishing an Asia-Pacific operation center 
and a special free trade zone is now a fixed direction; on this 
premise, the issue of direct flights between both sides of the 
strait cannot be always avoided, and preliminary planning should 
be done. He also said that the issue of direct flights between 
the two sides of the strait is not merely an economic issue, but 
should be considered together with planning for Hong Kong and an 
Asia-Pacific operations base. 
  In addition, regarding the Hong Kong issue, Ku Chen-fu said 
that Hong Kong is currently the cite of entrepot trade between 
Taiwan and the mainland, and that due to the importance of Hong 
Kong's position, Taiwan's future policy toward Hong Kong, as 
well as other relevant measures, are very important matters, and 
industrial and commercial circles must be allowed to understand 
them two or three years ahead of promulgation so they can make 
preparations.

<F P=106> [Commentary by station editor (Wang Huiqing): "Seize the </F>
Opportunity and Lift Restrictions on Three Direct Links"; from 
the "News and Current Events" program] 
  [Text] Three major events in the mainland's diplomatic 
relationship occurred at the end of 1993 and the beginning of 
1994. The first major event was the Sino-U.S. summit, e.g. the 
meeting between Jiang Zemin and Clinton in Seattle, United 
States, the first such meeting in five years; the second being 
the joint communique issued by the Chinese and French 
Governments on the resumption of the traditional friendly 
relationship between the two sides; the third major event, which 
occurred a little bit earlier, was German Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl's leading a 200-member delegation to China. The three 
astounding major events came on the heels of each other. 
International media is of the view that there will be a global 
China craze. Economy is the foundation of politics. Diplomacy 
is like a piece of mirror which reflects a nation's interests. 
The brilliant achievements that the mainland has scored over 
the past 15 years of reform and opening up shows the world that 
in addition to recognizing China as a political power, they 
should not ignore China's economic vitality and potentials. If 
major Western powers want to shake off recession and develop 
their economies, they cannot afford to neglect the thriving land 
of China. The attraction of China's economy has forced some 
Western nations to change their policy: from a policy that tried 
to isolate and impose sanctions on China to a policy that seeks 
detente, cooperation, and friendly exchange with China. While 
Western economies failed to stage a comeback last year, Asian 
economies thrived and enjoyed an economic growth rate of 7 
percent. In particular, Mainland China topped the world's 
growth rate at 13 percent. At the same time, Mainland China has 
become a country that has attracted the most foreign capital. On 
1 January this year, and with the rising of the red sun, five 
new sets of tax law were simultaneously put into force. 
Following that, reform on the foreign exchange was carried out. 
Various reform measures and laws and regulations in the areas 
of finance, taxation, foreign trade, and enterprises will be 
introduced this year. Unlike in the past, reform measures, 
along with other supplementary reform measures, will be 
comprehensively carried out this year, thus forming a systematic 
project. This shows that following an accumulation of 11 years 
of experience, the policy of reform and opening up has entered a 
mature stage. With the heralding in of 1994, the mainland will 
provide an improved and ideal environment for foreigners who 
come to the mainland for economic and trade cooperation. 
  The economic and trade exchanges between Taiwan and the 
mainland, due to rapid development over the years, have become 
the most active part of all exchanges between the two sides of 
the strait. As of last year, the number of companies and 
enterprises that Taiwan businessmen established on the mainland 
reached some 15,000, with a promised investment amount of over 
$13 billion and an actual investment amount of over $6 billion, 
thus exceeding the combined investment amount of previous years 
and catapulting Taiwan into second place in the number of 
foreign-funded enterprises. The cross-strait trade amount has 
exceeded $12 billion. 
  Amid the surging tide of economy and trade, Taiwan 
authorities did lift some restrictions and make some 
relaxations. However, the cross-strait economic and trade 
relationship is still unable to cross a hurdle. Over the years, 
economic exchanges between the two sides, due to different 
attitudes, have always tended to be active on the one side and 
passive on the other. Obstacles abound in the course of 
progress. On the island, the authorities have always dragged 
their feet and the private circles have always prodded the 
authorities to advance; the authorities are unable to keep up 
with the pace of private circles. At a time when the mainland's 
economic situation is progressing by leaps and bounds and is 
attracting a large infusion of capital from the world, 
businessmen and well- informed people realize the pressing 
situation and strongly call on the Taiwan authorities to change 
their present mainland policy. Recently, articles published in 
several big and influential Taiwan newspapers pointed out that 
at a time when the world's economic structure is undergoing a 
realignment, the mainland occupies a pivotal position. Japan 
and the United States have already unveiled their new China 
policies. Taiwan should follow suit. Some economic officials 
also suggested this to the authorities, noting that Taiwan, 
after World War II, knew how to seize the opportunity presented 
in world stability and created its economic development. This 
time, if Taiwan is able to seize the opportunity of the 
mainland's reform, it will enable Taiwan to carry out a smooth 
readjustment of its industrial structure. Some scholars even 
bluntly pointed out that if Taiwan sets self-imposed limitations 
because of political factors and lets foreign countries get a 
headstart, Taiwan will lose a great chance for investment, 
cooperation, and development. Taiwan would also be helping its 
own business rivals. There is a saying: making an erroneous 
step, you will lag behind others for 100 years. 
  Faced with such a situation, how should the Taiwan 
authorities act? It will help nothing if they just sigh and 
live in regret. Opportunity, once missed, will not come back. 
The most practical thing for the authorities to do is to 
resolutely lift the restrictions on the three direct links, so 
as to bring about a breakthrough development of the cross-strait 
relationship in the new year.

  [Text] Hong Kong, January 31 (CNS)--"The Taiwan Mainland 
Affairs Council of the Executive Yuan" said that Taiwan capital 
invested in the mainland was estimated to be between US$25 
billion and US$30 billion as of late last year. 
  A report by this Taiwan group pointed out that such a vast 
amount of capital was projected to have flowed into the mainland 
by the end last year in spite of a previous estimate by the 
council that Mainland-bound investment was expected to be 
US$19.4 billion as of November last year. 
  As for trade across the straits involving Hong Kong for this 
year, the report said that following a sharp devaluation of the 
renminbi early this year and the continuous opening of the 
Taiwan market to mainland raw materials as well as a relaxation 
of restrictions on mainland imports, a change in the pattern of 
trade between Taiwan and Hong Kong this year was expected, that 
is, a great rise in imports and a slow down of growth in 
exports. Products exported from Taiwan to the mainland will 
increase in volume rather than decline. 
  As for the investment sector, the report said that Hong Kong 
ranked fourth in terms of Taiwan investment abroad but Hong Kong 
investment in Taiwan and in the mainland showed a growing gap. 
Investment made by the territory in the mainland in 1992 was 200 
times that made in Taiwan during the same period while Taiwan 
became the second greatest investor in the mainland.

  [Text] Beijing, 24 January (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN 
SHE)--According to statistics released by the State Patent 
Bureau, a total of 5,261 patent right petitions from Taiwan 
Province were sent to the State Patent Bureau in 1993, 
registering a 55 percent increase over the figure of 3,391 
during the same period of the previous year. Thus, the number 
of patent right petitions from Taiwan ranks second among those 
sent by other provinces and municipalities across the country. 
  The State Patent Bureau issued a "Circular on the Handling 
of 
Patent Right Petitions by Taiwan Compatriots" in December 1987, 
which met with a warm response among people from Taiwan's 
scientific and technological as well as industrial and 
commercial circles. In 1988 alone, the State Patten Bureau 
received 182 patent right petitions submitted by people in 
Taiwan. Since then, the number of petitions for patent rights 
have been increased yearly. Over recent years, an 106-percent 
increase has been registered in the number of patent right 
petitions sent from Taiwan, a most rapid growth rate in the 
entire country. 
  It has been learned that most of the petitions from Taiwan 
are sent by individuals. As of the end of 1993, the State 
Patent Bureau has handled 11,546 patent right petitions 
submitted by Taiwan compatriots, and granted patent right to 
6,409 petitioners.

<F P=106> [Report by Ho Chien-min; from the "Hookup" program] </F>
  [Text] On the eve of the Chiao-Tang talks between the 
Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] and the Association for 
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS], which will take 
place in Beijing today, Vice Chairman of the Mainland Affairs 
Council [MAC] Kao Kung-lien yesterday said: Communist China has 
not lessened its hostility to us; in fact, it has begun acting 
without commenting on its military preparations against Taiwan. 
This action by our compatriots is something we should be alert 
to. 
  The Chiao-Tang talks between the two organizations will be 
held soon. On the eve of the talks MAC Vice Chairman Kao 
Kung-lien said his group considered the meeting a routine one to 
discuss low-level and economic matters and he did not expect 
much from it. 
  [Begin Kao recording] The SEF and the ARATS will soon hold a 
five-day meeting in Beijing. The meeting will mainly discuss 
routine and economic matters. Meanwhile, we hope the two sides 
can further exchange views on problems and obstacles faced by 
the meeting. [end recording] 
  Vice Chairman Kao Kung-lien also made a statement in the 
light of Communist China's current policy toward Taiwan. He 
said: Following the Ku-Wang meeting, Communist China has 
repeatedly said that the era of using dialogue to solve disputes 
has come; however, Communist China's hostility against us has 
not lessened. According to MAC's understanding, Communist China 
has adopted dual tactics in dealing with Taiwan. On the one 
hand it uses its open policy in economic affairs to attract 
Taiwan businessmen and absorb capital from Taiwan, on the other 
hand it has begun acting without commenting on its military 
preparations for aggression [qin lue] against Taiwan. 
  [Begin Kao recording] They have realized that the work of 
peaceful reunification cannot be accomplished quickly, but they 
have also stressed that the matter must not be delayed and have 
called for a sense of urgency. Their inner circle [nei pu], 
therefore, has repeatedly threatened to maintain its military 
menace toward Taiwan. In order to stop this threat causing 
Taiwan businessmen to hesitate or shift funds to other places, 
they have also stressed that preparations for a military 
struggle [chun shih tou cheng] should be extremely calm and 
collected [pu tung sheng se], be solid, and done without saying 
anything. [end recording] 
  Vice Chairman Kao Kung-lien emphatically pointed out that it 
was precisely because of Communist China's hard line attitude 
that exchanges between the two sides of the strait should 
continue to be conducted prudently.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 31 (CNA) -- Chiao Jen-ho, vice 
chairman and secretary-general of Straits Exchange Foundation 
(SEF), left for Beijing Monday [31 January] morning to meet his 
mainland Chinese counterpart Tang Shubei for a new round of 
cross-Taiwan strait talks. 
  Although this round of talks might also end without reaching 
agreement Chiao said at the airport, "The increase in mutual 
trust is a positive development." 
  Chiao's meeting with Tang, vice chairman and 
secretary-general of the Beijing-based Association for Relations 
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), was arranged based on an 
accord reached during the talks between SEF Chairman Ku Chen-fu 
and ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan last April in Singapore. The 
accord calls for quarterly meetings between SEF and ARATS 
officials of the deputy secretary-general or department director 
level. 
  The Chiao-Tang talks will take place Tuesday and Wednesday 
afternoons and Friday morning at the Diaoyutai State Guest House. 
  They will focus on reviewing the results of the three cross- 
strait technical talks held last year in the hope that more 
progress can be made during future discussions. 
  The two heads of the intermediary organizations will also 
look into the operations of both SEF and ARATS as well as review 
the implementation of the agreements signed during the 
"Ku-Wang" talks. 
  Issues related to a second "Ku-Wang" meeting will also be 
considered during the talks, according to one of Chiao's aides. 
  Chiao was traveling in the company of SEF Deputy 
Secretaries-General Shih Chi-ping and Hsu Huei-yu. 
  SEF Chief Secretary Wu Shu, who arrived in Beijing three 
days 
ago, held a meeting Saturday with ARATS Deputy Secretary-General 
Zhao Zhengyu, to prepare for the forthcoming talks.

  [Text] Chen Ming-chang, director of Economic Affairs under 
the Mainland Affairs Council [MAC], today [12 January] said that 
the issue of "direct shipping between designated points" across 
the strait will definitely not be put on the agenda of a meeting 
to review mainland work that has been slated for 6-7 June this 
year. However, it has been learned that the MAC has arranged for 
its Vice Chairman Kao Koong-lian to personally explain to the 
people our policy and stand vis-a-vis why it is inappropriate 
for cross-strait "direct shipping between designated points" at 
the present stage. 
  It has been learned that the MAC still holds that before the 
removal of substantive barriers in politics, law, and security 
confronting the issue of direct navigation between the two sides 
of the strait, various forms of shipping links such as "direct 
shipping between designated points" and "unilateral opening to 
shipping" may just slightly improve on the subject of opening up 
navigation in terms of volume or mode, but their practicality is 
not great. Nevertheless, the MAC still has not ruled out the 
possibility of carrying out such a link as "direct shipping 
between designated points" or "unilateral opening to shipping" 
in the initial stage as a transitional measure after direct 
navigation has been opened up.

  The proposed revisions will allow foreign workers to remain 
in Taiwan up to three years, one year longer than the current 
limit. 
  COLA also proposed revisions which will allow foreign 
laborers to apply for jobs offered by employers other than the 
one that sponsored their entry into Taiwan. Currently, foreign 
workers are legally bound to their employers and cannot seek 
employment elsewhere on the island. 
  Other revisions proposed by COLA include a measure which 
would require any enterprise facing a labor shortage to make a 
public announcement about the shortage so that domestic workers 
unions can take part in the recruiting process. 
  If an employer is found to have made a false statement about 
the labor shortage, or fired workers after employing them, COLA 
will be allowed to punish the employer under the revisions. 
  COLA Chairman Chao Shou-po said the revisions will address 
many of the problems which have plagued the department over the 
past few years. 
  COLA officials said they wanted to extend the maximum 
allowed 
time for foreign workers because the current limit is too short. 
Workers now have to leave just after they have become familiar 
with their working environment, they said, which limits their 
contributions. 
  And to prevent foreign laborers from leaving their work 
illegally, Chao instructed employers to deposit a certain share 
of the workers' wages in a special account, which is returned to 
the workers when they return home. 
  The revisions will be sent to the Executive Yuan for review 
in March.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The United States Still Has the Ambition To </F>
Lead the World -- Analyzing President Clinton's State of the 
Union Address"] 
  [Text] U.S. President Clinton delivered a state of the 
union address on 25 January providing a complete picture for his 
administration's policy for the new year. The 63-minute speech 
revealed the thorny issues currently facing the United States 
while demonstrating the U.S. ambition to lead the world. 
  Basically, the address focuses on U.S. domestic issues. 
Clinton placed cracking down on crime and reforming the health 
insurance and social welfare system on the top of U.S. domestic 
issues. His placing cracking down on crime above economic 
issues is quite a noteworthy signal. The high crime rate has 
become a problem the American people are most concerned about. 
Because the entire American society has been eroded and is 
being paralyzed, Clinton, in addition to urging the U.S. 
Congress to pass the bill on cracking down on crime, called on 
all American people to abide by law and order, to work 
hand-in-hand to rebuild American society, and to regain the 
forces that had bound the society to enable the American people 
to overcome their frustration, defeat the evils, and create a 
good future. 
  Health insurance for everyone is another issue that Clinton 
has insisted on. He hopes to revamp the current health 
insurance system so that the 37 million Americans who currently 
are not insured will also be taken care of. If the bill is 
passed, it will be the most significant U.S. social reform since 
the life-time social security welfare system was established in 
the later days of the Great Depression. While delivering the 
state of the union address, Clinton even threatened that he 
would immediately veto the Congress' version of the 
comprehensive health insurance plan if it could not provide 
health care to all Americans. 
  Obviously, Clinton's state of the union address was designed 
to create a favorable climate for the Democratic Party's 
mid-term election campaign at the end of this year. Whether the 
Congress will pass the health insurance bill is something that 
remains to be seen. But, it is indisputable that Clinton was 
able to tightly grip the pulse of the times and to precisely 
point out the issues the American people are most concerned 
about. The state of the union address indeed gives us a quite 
clear indicator for gaining an idea of what course the United 
States will take in the future. As a matter of fact, many of 
the problems Clinton raised in the state of the union address 
are not unique problems of the United States. Such problems as 
the rise in crime rate, change in people's perception of values, 
and the crumbling of society's binding force are common problems 
that obsess many societies during their transformation periods. 
Therefore, Clinton's urge for rebuilding society also provides 
other countries with a soul-searching opportunity. 
  What kind of foreign policy the United States will pursue at 
a time when the country is facing domestic difficulties is also 
a problem the world is concerned about. In the state of the 
union address, Clinton said the United States will maintain a 
strong national defense and will not leave the rest of the world 
alone -- this for the time being should give relief to those who 
had been worried that the United States might return to 
isolationism. However, this does not mean the United States is 
capable of establishing a single-polar power setup with the 
United States as the sole dominant force -- it still needs the 
cooperation of other countries concerned. For this reason, 
although Clinton said Mainland China must make noticeable 
improvement in its human rights record, he did not use the 
most-favored-nation issue as a means to force Peking [Beijing] 
to comply. It is quite clear that Washington is doing 
everything it can to improve its relations with Peking -- this 
is a fact that we must know clearly in observing U.S. policy 
toward China. 
  Northeast Asia (Communist China, Russia, and the Korean 
peninsula) constitutes a significant portion of the part of the 
state of the union address that deals with U.S. foreign policy. 
Northeast Asia is a potential flash point that not only has 
always been a potential security problem for the United States, 
but also is closely related to building a new international 
order. Such being the case, Clinton, in addition to his efforts 
to improve relations with Communist China, declared that the 
United States will support the promotion of democracy in former 
Soviet Union countries -- including Russia -- and will continue 
to push for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula. 
  But, these goals cannot be achieved overnight. Russia's 
economic reform has slowed down, and Moscow's relations with its 
neighbors are becoming increasingly tense. Russian Foreign 
Minister Kozyrev recently complained that the West simply does 
not understand Russia's "special role" in the former Soviet 
Union bloc -- this shows how tense relations are. All these 
problems may result in the resurgence of radical Russian 
nationalism. Ukraine's situation is more or less the same. 
According to Western intelligence, if Ukraine's economic 
situation does not improve, racial conflicts will very likely be 
stirred up, which will result in a splitting of the country. If 
this happens, the agreement between Ukraine and the United 
States signed recently at the Moscow summit meeting on 
destroying Ukraine's nuclear weapons may be torn up. Such an 
outcome very likely will directly jeopardize the already fragile 
Russian-Ukrainian relations. Facing these situations, the West 
does not seem to have a set of effective countermeasures. 
Therefore, maintaining good relations with Communist China to 
check Russia's possible expansion from the southern flank has 
become a natural response of the United States in the present 
stage. 
  Tensions on the Korean peninsula are also on the rise. North 
Korea has threatened to tear up the armistice agreement of the 
Korean war if the United States imposes economic santions on it. 
In response, the United States is considering deploying Patriot 
missiles in Korea. From this development, we can see that there 
is still a long way to go to make the Korean peninsula 
nuclear-free. In view of Communist China's close relations with 
North Korea, Washington must rely on Peking as a lever for 
dealing with Pyongyang. 
  Relations between Russia, Communist China, and North Korea 
are intricate and entangled with each other. If Russia's 
economic and political reforms succeed, then, given that 
Peking's military spending has continued to increase, Moscow 
certainly can serve as a kind of checking force. But at a time 
when Russia itself is full of crises, the United States can only 
try to improve its relations with Communist China and invite it 
to make common efforts to ensure world peace. 
  Then, will Communist China exercise self-restraint on 
weapons 
exportation and on other issues, and how will the United States, 
while pursuing its security benefits, continue to apply pressure 
on Communist China's human rights record? -- these are the 
developments we should keep a close eye on while analyzing 
Clinton's state of the union address.

  [Text] Beijing, January 31 (XINHUA) -- The visit to three 
West European countries by Qiao Shi, chairman of China's 
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, was very 
successful and has achieved anticipated results, a senior NPC 
official said. 
  Cao Zhi, secretary-general of the NPC Standing Committee, 
told reporters today that during his official goodwill visit to 
Germany, Switzerland and Austria on January 16-30, Qiao was 
given very warm and friendly receptions by the leaders of 
parliaments and governments of the three countries. 
  The visit has given an impetus to the further growth of 
relations between China and the three countries, he added. 
  Cao quoted Qiao as saying that China has always attached 
great importance to developing friendly ties and cooperation 
with West European countries, including Germany, Switzerland and 
Austria. 
  Qiao said that China also hopes that such relationship will 
be developed in a durable and stable way by adopting by all 
sides a policy of mutual respect, seeking common ground while 
reserving differences, non-interference in each other's internal 
affairs, equality, and mutual benefit. 
  Cao said the leaders of the three countries said that they 
place great importance on developing ties with China, which they 
think is exerting an important influence in the world political 
and economic fields. 
  German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel reaffirmed their support for China's peaceful 
reunification, and the resumption of China's signatory's status 
within the General Agreement on Tarrifs and Trade. 
  Otto Stich, president of the Swiss Confederation, said 
Switzerland wants to further expand cooperation with China in 
all fields. The Austrian leaders stressed that Austria will pay 
more attention to developing ties with Asian countries, 
especially with China. 
  Cao said Qiao's visit will also promote China's economic 
relations and trade with Germany, Switzerland and Austria. 
  During the visit, he said, Qiao briefed the parliament and 
government leaders of the three countries on China's economic 
growth and reform, as well as opening to the outside world. 
  The leaders and industrial enterpreneurs of the three 
countries agree that the achievements China has made in its 
economic development have been great in the past 15 years. 
  All of them expressed confidence in the future of China's 
reform, and showed great enthusiasm about furthering their 
economic and trade ties with China. 
  They also expressed the hope for investing in China, 
expanding their economic cooperation and trade relations, and 
extending the cooperative areas to culture, 
scientific-technological research and education, Cao said. 
  He said Qiao's visit has enhanced the exchanges and 
cooperation between the China's parliament and those of the 
three countries. 
  Qiao pointed out during the visit that the NPC was facing 
the 
task of making laws for the growing socialist market economy of 
China. 
  "We will initially form a frame structure of the legal 
system 
which will conform to the needs of the market economy, and also 
draw on legislative experiences and fruits of other countries," 
he said. 
  "This requires us to strengthen exchanges and cooperation 
between the NPC and the parliaments of countries all over the 
world," he added. 
  The leaders of the parliaments of the three European 
countries spoke highly of the existing friendly ties and 
cooperation with China, and intended to further develop 
relations with the NPC and to expand mutual exchanges and 
cooperation. 
  Cao said that Qiao also exchanged views with the leaders of 
the three countries on major international issues in a frank and 
sincere way, thus enhancing mutual understanding and reaching 
more common views on a wide range of issues.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean Leclerc du Sablon in Beijing: "France and </F>
China: The Age of Maturity"] 
  [Text] In the last few years, General de Gaulle's name as 
pronounced by Chinese leaders had a reproachful ring, being 
directed at governments which proved too accommodating with 
their Taiwanese nationalist rivals. Again yesterday, they 
repeatedly invoked his name, this time as a moral warning for 
their renewed assertion that they are the sole masters of a 
single country -- greater China. 
  On 27 January 1946, the father of the French Fifth Republic 
[de Gaulle] repudiated Chiang Kai-Chek's China in favor of Mao 
Zedong's. Thirty years after this mutual recognition, the two 
states have been through a few "hurdles" before reaching "the 
age of maturity," said Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian 
Qichen on welcoming the delegation sent by Edouard Balladur to 
celebrate this 30th anniversary. 
  This, he noted, was a "highly symbolic" delegation, being 
led 
by Alain Peyrefitte, "an old friend of China's, a member of 
General de Gaulle's government, a fervent champion, and an 
important witness" of Franco-Chinese relations, as well as 
Admiral Philippe de Gaulle and Claude Chayet, the first French 
ambassador in Beijing. The recognition of "Asia's oldest 
nation-state" by "the Western world's oldest nation-state," said 
Alain Peyrefitte on unveiling a plaque at the French Embassy, 
meant that "the state ruled by the Beijing government was the 
one which embodied the Chinese nation." 
  Courteously reserved on the "meandering" history of 
relations 
between Paris and Beijing -- a near-divorce when France 
condemned the 1989 Tiananmen massacre, almost consummated after 
the sale of 60 Mirage fighter aircraft to Taiwan -- the chinese 
minister chose to insist instead on political grandeur and trade 
relations, those very relations which French firms were denied 
by a vengeful Beijing two years ago. 
<H5>  `Vast Opportunities' </H5>
  "As influential world powers," said Qian Qichen, China and 
France bear a special responsibility for maintaining peace" and 
they must "intensify their consultations." As for 
manufacturers, economic reform offers them "vast business 
opportunities: We are hoping that more of them will invest [in 
the Chinese economy]." 
  At a dinner offered by China's foreign minister, Alain 
Peyrefitte recounted with equal subtlety the successive steps 
toward "restored trust": the history, the contracts, and human 
rights. The 1964 "act" "implied neither approval nor 
disapproval" of the Communist regime, but common interest 
required such an attempt at "undermining the bipolar world that 
had come out of Yalta." 
  According to Mr. Peyrefitte, the French will contribute "all 
the more willingly" to China's economic growth if "they feel 
they are contributing to increased dignity and freedom for the 
Chinese people." While unwilling to "impinge on a sovereign 
state's internal affairs," he thinks that "one must understand" 
that the country of the 1789 Revolution and the Declaration of 
Human Rights "cannot be insensitive to matters relating to the 
respect of individual and group freedoms." 
  However, the "clouds" in the Franco-Chinese relationship are 
supposed to have vanished on the release of the 12 January 
communique, in which the French Government was undertaking not 
to sell any more weapons to Taiwan.

<F P=106> [Interview with Governor Christopher Patten by Sonny Lim, </F>
producer of Singapore International Television's "Inside Asia" 
program, at Hong Kong Government House; date not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Lim] I guess what is significant perhaps of your 
decision is that it seems to me to be a unilateral action on 
your part to go ahead with the reforms. I know you said you 
wanted to do it, but you took action on an independent basis and 
went ahead and said, OK let's go. Let's give it a go. 
  [Patten] That is, broadly speaking, right. The Chinese knew 
perfectly well that we had to start taking some decisions in 
early December. I don't think they were under any illusions 
about that; we have responsibilities. We have responsibilities 
to legislate to the electoral arrangement and to administer the 
elections. And we have to discharge these responsibilities, 
though I would much prefer to do so after agreement with the 
Chinese side. 
  [Lim] But by your taking unilateral action, doesn't that 
give the Chinese an excuse to do the same? Doesn't it invite 
them to do the same, really? 
  [Patten] I don't think so because the Chinese recognize, 
after all, it is explicit in the joint declaration that we are 
sovereign until 1997 and that means we have certain 
responsibilities and of course what the joint declaration is 
supposed to do is to ensure that China cooperates with us while 
we discharge those responsibilities until 1997. Cooperation has 
not been perhaps as extensive as we would have liked. 
Cooperation is of course a two-way street. 
  [Lim] Throughout the negotiations, though, it has been very 
public. You have been quite accessible to the press and I would 
say the Chinese have become more accessible. But if you look 
back at it now and given the fact that there was a report 
recently that you had tried to establish a secret channel of 
communications before you came out here, would you not prefer 
the negotiations to be less public? 
  [Patten] Well, I would have preferred to have gotten an 
agreement whether through a secret or in public, but I don't 
think that you could have had negotiations going on for the best 
part of a year or even longer in secret. I think it would have 
been impossible. 
  [Lim] Why do you say that? 
  [Patten] I think that you will know that what we sought in 
the first place was a rather better channel of communications 
with the Chinese side and we sought that very sincerely. 
Unfortunately, they did not seem to have the interest at the 
time, which was shortly after I had come to Hong Kong. I think 
that is perhaps an indication of what the Chinese sometimes call 
sincerity. 
  [Lim] Alright. Let's talk about the Chinese reaction for a 
bit. They have said that no matter what you do, governor, we 
are going to eliminate Legco, Legislative Council. We are going 
to eliminate the legislature anyway. Does that worry you at all? 
  [Patten] Well, I don't find a Chinese threat to do something 
which would be very much against Hong Kong interests in 1997 a 
persuasive argument for us to do things which are against Hong 
Kong interests in 1994. 
  [Lim] So you think they are bluffing? 
  [Patten] I didn't say that. I very much hope that they will 
not throw out the window institutional arrangements which work 
and which are acceptable to people in Hong Kong and which in no 
way represent a threat to the rest of China after 1997. I don't 
actually think that as their first act of sovereignty that China 
will simply overturn the arrangements that they find here in 
Hong Kong. But that said, I repeat the point I was making 
earlier. If China says we will do something which does not make 
any sense at all in three or four years time, it does not mean 
that we would be sensible to do something which is not in Hong 
Kong's interests today. 
  [Lim] But if you are not quite sure that they are bluffing 
and I think you have indicated this, aren't you sort of 
jeopardizing people who have to stay here after 1997? 
  [Patten] I think we will be jeopardizing them far more if we 
connived at putting in place arrangements before 1997 which 
weren't fair, if we gave a veneer of respectability to 
arrangements which would in the end prove corrosive to the rule 
of law and to Hong Kong's free institutions. I think if we were 
to do that, we would be very unwise and I think we would be 
condemned in Hong Kong and outside Hong Kong. 
  [Lim] Outside Hong Kong, Beijing has already also set up the 
Preliminary Working Committee, the PWC. Do you feel threatened 
by this at all? 
  [Patten] Well, I don't think so. They describe themselves 
increasingly in strange and interesting ways under a certain 
amount of criticism. They have now said we are not an organ of 
power, but just a talking shop. There was a poll over the 
weekend. One should not take every poll seriously, but I think 
it sort of reflected people's views which suggested that 70 
percent of people in Hong Kong did not trust them, or certainly 
did not trust them very much. And they do have credibility 
problems, but I very much hope that they will begin to represent 
some of Hong Kong's interests to China. The more channels of 
communications there are, the better. But no threats to the 
governments authority or credibility. The threat to our 
authority would have come if we had been prepared to do a rotten 
deal with the Chinese officials. That would have been a real 
threat to our authority. 
  [Lim] If the PWC is not a threat, is not seen as a threat, 
why did you recently then say, look, local legislators don't 
accept the invitations to be in the PWC? Why did you not think 
it is a good idea when you do not see it as a threat? 
  [Patten] What we have received is a request to send civil 
servants to Beijing to brief the PWC and we don't think it is a 
very good idea. 
  [Lim] Why not? 
  [Patten] For a number of reasons, let me tell you. First of 
all, their existing arrangement under the joint declaration for 
improving relations between Britain, China, and Hong Kong for 
dealing with transitional matters and, for example, the Joint 
Liaison Group through which we would like to be doing a great 
deal more business than we are actually managing to achieve at 
present because China tends to drag her feet in the Joint 
Liaison Group. 
  [Lim] You mentioned Legco just now. You have gazetted the 
reforms, watered down they may be. But, let's say for some 
reason or another, the legislators say, well, I am not sure so 
sure I would like to pass this and it does not pass. Would you 
feel at that point disappointment as well as some relief, 
perhaps? 
  [Patten] I'd feel acute disappointment. 
  [Lim, interrupting] No relief? 
  [Patten] No relief whatsoever because we are responsible for 
good government in Hong Kong. We are responsible for the 
electoral arrangements and we have to have electoral 
arrangements in place. Whatever arrangements, whatever proposals 
we put to the Legislative Council, we will argue for as 
vigorously as possible. I certainly don't intend to put 
proposals to the Legislative Council which I would like the 
Legislative Council to water down or change in some way. That 
is not political leadership. 
  [Lim] I asked if you would feel any relief because if the 
reforms do not pass, in a sense, the whole issue sort of blows 
over and you would have been seen to have tried, to have fought 
tooth and nail to get through this, but Legco says sorry, we 
don't think it is a good idea. 
  [Patten] In what is becoming an increasingly balding and 
grey-headed political career, I have always believed myself that 
I am trying to be too clever by half, though a very very bad way 
of trying to conduct public business. I think that clarity is 
important. I think you set out what you want to try to do and 
then you try to do it. And I don't know any better way of 
giving a political lead and I don't know of any better way of 
trying to mobilize consent so we will do what we believe is in 
Hong Kong's interests. It is a true point that I have made many 
times. It is true that I can't go further than Hong Kong is 
prepared to go, but nor in my judgment can I go less far than 
Hong Kong is prepared to go. 
  [Lim] I find it a bit ironic, though, because in a speech in 
October, you said that the community's legislature, you are 
responsible for setting the limits to this government's ability 
to strengthen democracy, but you are asking the legislature to 
take responsibility for negotiations that have been held outside 
of their vision, outside of their involvement, but when push 
comes to shove, it is still their responsibility. 
  [Patten] What we are doing is recognizing the constitutional 
role of the Legislative Council, which is to pass, to agree, to 
amend legislation and electoral matters. That is the position 
under the present constitutional arrangements in Hong Kong and, 
I whisper the words in case Chinese officials are listening, 
that will be the position and under the constitutional 
arrangements after 1997. What we are doing is attempting to 
shape Hong Kong's political institutions in consultation with 
the Legislative Council; it is a process of political dialogue 
which I think one should find not only acceptable, but immensely 
practical in an open society like this. 
  [Lim] And lastly, in the past 10 months, has this job gotten 
any easier for you? 
  [Patten] No, I don't think anybody would regard this as one 
of the easier jobs in the world. 
  [Lim] Less difficult, lets just say. 
  [Patten] It remains challenging and fascinating and I hope 
learning that in order to do it, I need to be rather fitter and 
keep my wits about me and I hope that I'm also learning to do it 
without being provoked by the noises off that we sometimes hear 
from the mainland. 
  [Lim] Thank you for your time, governor. 
  [Patten] Thank you very much.

  [Text] Beijing, January 31 (XINHUA) -- An 11-person team 
headed by Chiao Jen-ho, vice-chairman and secretary-general of 
the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), arrived in 
Beijing this afternoon to prepare for talks between the SEF 
chairman and the president of the Association for Relations 
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) on the mainland. 
  Zou Zhekai, vice-president and secretary-general of ARATS, 
greeted them at the airport on behalf of ARATS Chairman Wang 
Daohan and Vice-Chairman Tang Shubei. 
  Under an agreement reached between the two organizations, 
Tang Shubei and Zou Zhekai will meet with Chiao Jen-ho from 
February 1-4 in advance of talks between Wang Daohan, ARATS 
president, and Ku Chen-fu, SEF chairman. They will also 
exchange views on other issues of mutual or unilateral concern. 
  Zou Zhekai said that he hoped this meeting would achieve 
good 
results and have positive bearings on the future talks. He 
hoped that greater progress would be made in relations between 
the two organizations. 
  Chiao Jen-ho said at the airport that he hoped his trip 
would 
benefit the development of relations across the straits. 
  He hoped that this meeting would improve cooperation, 
strengthen relations and promote understanding between the two 
sides. 
  Reflecting on the talks that have been held, Chiao said that 
it is very important to increase contacts and talks. Every 
meeting or discussion will bring closer the understanding 
between the two sides, he said. 
  He is willing to exchange views with Tang Shubei on the 
issue 
of mutual visits between top economic and trade personnel of the 
two sides, Chiao said. 
  ARATS Vice-President Tang Shubei hosted a dinner in honor of 
Chiao Jen-ho at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse this evening.

  [Text] The prohibition on investment in the mainland by 
building, engineering consulting, and leasing traders has been 
lifted conditionally. The Ministry of Economic Affairs 
yesterday held the first meeting of the special task force on 
examining applications for investment in the mainland. The 
meeting approved for the first time indirect investment in the 
mainland by building, engineering consulting, and leasing 
traders. In addition, the meeting also, in principle, gave a 
green signal to indirect investment in the mainland by passenger 
transportation traders. Due to incomplete application data 
submitted by the traders for examination at the meeting, the 
ministry will hold its official approval to the passenger 
transportation trade until the next meeting of the special task 
force. 
  In accordance with the principles for examining investment 
and technology cooperation projects in the mainland, promulgated 
on 31 December last year, the ministry convened the first 
meeting of the supra-ministerial special task force yesterday. 
At the meeting, representatives from various ministries 
examined 18 projects on investment in the mainland. As the 
Construction and Planning Administration under the Interior 
Ministry insisted that examination for applications from 
building and construction traders must be separated, Li 
Shu-chiu, executive vice minister of economic affairs who 
chaired the meeting, said: Building traders may invest in the 
mainland conditionally; however, the prohibition shall continue 
to be enforced on construction traders planning to invest mainly 
in development and marketing projects in the mainland.

<F P=106> [Report: "Deng Xiaoping Is Optimistic, and Never Afraid of </F>
the Sky Falling; He Takes a Cold Shower Every Morning, and This 
Promises Longevity"] 
  [Text] CPC senior leader Deng Xiaoping, now at the 
advanced age of 89, has three methods of keeping in good health 
and prolonging life: Being optimistic, taking cold showers, and 
playing bridge. 
  According to a report by JIEFANGJUN JIANKANG ZAZHI [PLA 
HEALTH JOURNAL], at a meeting with German Chancellor Kohl in 
1984, Deng Xiaoping revealed his method of keeping in good 
health. On that occasion, Kohl asked Deng about his secret for 
achieving longevity, Deng answered: "I am always optimistic, 
and I am not afraid of the sky falling." 
  Deng Xiaoping added: "I am taking care of fewer and fewer 
things, and letting other people take care of more things. I 
want to live a few years longer. My greatest hope is to live 
beyond 1997." 
  Deng Xiaoping told Kohl that he still swims and plays 
bridge. 
Deng said that playing bridge was the best way to rest after 
being busy with state affairs, because he could forget 
everything else after taking up the cards. 
  The report also quoted Deng as saying: "In the past 10 
years, I have not even caught a cold. One of the reasons for my 
good health is that I take a cold shower every morning."

  [Text] Tokyo, January 31 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Vice Foreign 
Minister Kunihiko Saito said today that Japan intends to adhere 
to its non-nuclear position. 
  He denied an allegation by a British newspaper that Japan 
may 
change its declared stance and develop a nuclear capability 
because of the rumored nuclear program of the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). 
  Speaking at a press conference in Tokyo, the vice minister 
noted that Japan would maintain its 3-point non-nuclear 
principle of neither possessing nor producing nuclear weapons, 
and not allowing them on Japanese soil. He said that to do 
otherwise would only contribute to the instability of the 
international environment around Japan. 
  The British "SUNDAY TIMES" reported that Japan had acquired 
all the parts needed to make a nuclear weapon, and may have 
built a bomb which requires only plutonium to be completed.

<F P=106> ["Special feature" by reporter He Chong (6320 0394): "China </F>
and France Renew Friendly and Cooperative Relations"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 26 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--On the 
eve of the 30th anniversary of the establishment of Sino-French 
diplomatic ties, a French government delegation flew to Beijing 
to take part in ceremonious activities marking the occasion. 
The delegation's visit, which was designed to bring bilateral 
relations closer, followed the joint communique issued by the 
two countries to affirm the need to "renew their traditional 
friendly and cooperative relations" and "the agreement to hold 
regular consultations between foreign ministers of the two 
countries" reached when Qian Qichen, Chinese vice premier and 
foreign minister, visited France. All these have served to 
clear away the haze shrouding the relations between the two 
countries over the last three years. 
  As disclosed by newspapers in Paris recently, a debate broke 
out in the ruling coalition after German Chancellor Kohl's visit 
to China in November last year, and especially after the 
Sino-U.S. summit, because the visit and the summit had enabled 
the French public to see clearly that the two major countries in 
Europe and America respectively had adjusted their policies 
toward China and directed their attention to China's huge market 
in their efforts to expand trade and economic relations with 
China. The right-wing faction, represented by the Foreign 
Ministry and those standing for the interests of major 
industrial and commercial enterprises, stressed the need to 
stake heavily on the mainland market, while the other faction, 
represented by the defense ministry and those standing for the 
defense industry, were more interested in the Taiwan market. 
  In consequence, the former faction won a major victory. Just 
as French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said in his interview 
with a reporter from ECHO magazine: "Should we bet heavily on 
the side which has a population of 20 million or on the side 
which has a population of 1.2 billion and which is likely to 
become the third-biggest economic power? In fact the choice is 
very easy to make. We hope to reestablish relations based on 
mutual trust with China." 
  According to estimates by industrial and commercial circles, 
the sale of warships and fighters worth $8 billion to Taiwan 
might keep relevant French military enterprises busy for several 
years, but for that France would lose a huge market in mainland 
China for a long time. Such business is not worth doing, they 
said. In 1993 alone, France lost contracts and orders from 
China for Guangzhou's underground railway project, electronic 
telecommunications equipment, airbuses, and agricultural 
products worth 6 billion francs. If Sino-French relations were 
not improved in the future, in the next few years France would 
lose contracts for nuclear power equipment, telecommunications 
equipment, aircraft, automobiles, and equipment for the 
petrochemical industry, which would be worth 30 to 40 billion 
francs. What is more, following the example of Germany in 
formulating a "policy toward the East" and the example of the 
United States in shifting the stress to Asia in its economic and 
diplomatic drive, France is drafting an "overall plan for 
opening up markets in Asia" (under the plan, France will try to 
increase its market share in Asia from 1 to 3.5 percent). 
Without support from China, the plan would inevitably go down 
the drain. So the proud French had to mend their ways and 
President Mitterrand finally took a firm stand and decided that 
giving top priority to mainland China is a correct and practical 
diplomatic policy. 
  After French Foreign Minister Juppe openly expressed 
repentance on two occasions for the former government's selling 
weapons to Taiwan, the Chinese Government gave a favorable 
response by granting two interviews to Fuliman [fu li man 1715 
6849 2581], adviser to Balladur, prime minister of the 
right-wing ruling coalition, to discuss problems concerning 
renewal of bilateral relations. Taking into account the French 
side's difficulty in tearing up the contract for the arms deal 
(according to the contract, France must pay high compensation to 
Taiwan for failure to fulfill the contract), the Chinese side 
made an important concession, agreeing to bury the hatchet if 
the French Government made a "written promise" that it "would 
never sell arms to Taiwan in the future." 
  Undoubtedly France is mainly to blame for Sino-French 
relations turning sour in the past. After a sharp change took 
place in Eastern Europe in 1991 and the disintegration of the 
former Soviet Union, France, following the example of the United 
States, agreed in turn to sell 16 cruisers [xun fang jian 1559 
7089 5324] and 60 Mirage 200 fighter planes (Guangzhou is within 
their flight radius) to Taiwan to help the latter threaten the 
security of the mainland in an attempt to "destroy the last 
bastion of communism." China decided to order the closure of 
the French Consulate in Guangzhou in early March 1993 and 
suspended and reduced its trade with France after its repeated 
warnings against the arms deal proved ineffective. But facts 
show that China values its friendship with France. Though 
fighting back on just grounds, to its advantage, and with 
restraint, it still left ample room for maneuver. When France, 
which knew that it was in the wrong, sent a message on its own 
initiative seeking a rapprochement, China agreed to make a 
corresponding concession so as to renew friendly and cooperative 
relations between the two countries. 
  French Prime Minister Balladur is scheduled to visit China 
in 
March. This will herald a new stage of friendly and cooperative 
Sino-French relations.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by Europe-based staff reporter Tai </F>
Pao-erh (2071 1405 0334); dispatched from London on 25 January: 
"Ma Yuzhen Refutes Patten's Lies--Thoroughly Analyzing the 
Development of Sino-British Relations and Disputes Over the Hong 
Kong Issue"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Chris Patten Cheats Public Opinion </H5>
  Chinese Ambassador to Britain Ma Yuzhen criticized the 
statement Hong Kong Governor Patten made in London attacking 
China as a deliberate distortion of the Chinese Government's 
position which was inconsistent with the facts, with the aim of 
cheating public opinion. He expressed regret over the statement 
and was not bullish about the development of current 
Sino-British relations. 
  In an interview with this reporter, Ma Yuzhen made a 
thorough 
analysis of the development of Sino-British relations and the 
disputes caused by the Hong Kong issue in recent years. 
  First, he refuted four points in the statement Patten made 
when he returned to Britain last week to attend a hearing of the 
Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Select Committee. 
  1. Patten accused China of just making a concession in the 
Hong Kong political structure talks over lowering the voting 
age. This was at variance with the facts. In fact, China made 
major concessions in two other matters: Agreeing to let 
district boards and the Urban Council practice the single seat, 
single vote system and agreeing to abolish the appointed seats 
in the Urban Council and district boards before 1997 so as to 
reach an agreement. 
  "When he spoke at the hearing, Patten distorted China's 
position in the 17 rounds of talks and ignored the facts. It is 
unfair to try to overwhelm the other side by distorting its 
position and viewpoint. If even the most rudimentary rules of 
political negotiations are not followed, is there any 
credibility to speak of?" 
<H5>  Patten Misleads Britain and the Hong Kong People </H5>
  2. Patten stated on many occasions that he did not believe 
that China would dare overturn the three-tier council structure 
that he was pursuing just out of consideration of the pressure 
of world opinion. If he does think that, it means he is 
dreaming. Otherwise, fully aware that China will keep its 
promises, he still continues to pursue the three-violation 
uncooperative policy. This way of doing things is utterly 
irresponsible toward the Hong Kong people and Sino-British 
relations. In terms of political and legal principles, China 
can and must disband the three-tier councils in 1997. Patten's 
remark was designed to mislead Britain and the Hong Kong people. 
  Ma Yuzhen also refuted Patten's analogy of installing panes 
of glass for the Hong Kong people. He said: "The Hong Kong 
people have lived in this house without any panes of glass for 
more than 100 years. Now, when the British authorities are 
about to leave, they say they will install panes of glass, and 
in so saying they do not consult the host and residents. This 
way of doing things is ridiculous. It is an expression of phony 
benevolence. " 
  Regarding the pressure of world opinion which Patten 
stressed, analyzing it, Ambassador Ma Yuzhen said: Of the 180 
or so countries in the world, most are China's friends and Third 
World countries. They have experienced suppression by the 
imperialists. Will they now sympathize with Britain on the Hong 
Kong issue? China is improving its relations with 20 or so 
developed countries one after another. Moreover, since they 
have their own agendas, they will not change their policies 
toward China in accordance with London's wishes. 
<H5>  Patten Tries in Vain To Continue Colonialist Rule </H5>
  3. Patten criticized China's attitude as being 
"unreasonable." Refuting the criticism, Ma Yuzhen said: 
"China's response to Patten is based on an analysis of past 
events concerning China and Britain in the last 100 years or so 
and thus is very reasonable. It is really unreasonable for the 
British side to try in vain to continue its colonialist rule as 
the 21st century approaches." 
  4. Patten interpreted the spirit of the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration as being "fair and trustworthy elections." Ma 
Yuzhen pointed out: This is a distortion of the spirit of the 
Joint Declaration. Deliberately misinterpreting and belittling 
a document of great historic significance as a document 
concerning elections in a narrow sense is an act far removed 
from the spirit of the Joint Declaration. 
  "The spirit of the Joint Declaration lies in the Chinese 
resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong after 1997. Britain 
must return Hong Kong to China after 1997. This is a matter of 
sovereignty complete with administration. After the turnover of 
sovereignty, China will pursue the one-country, two-systems 
policy and conduct elections in accordance with the Basic Law. 
  China does not oppose either elections or democracy. 
However, if this is interpreted as the spirit of the Joint 
Declaration, even though public opinion is misled, those who are 
familiar with the Hong Kong situation cannot be misled." 
  When it came to the repeated British appeals for a 
resumption of talks, Ma Yuzhen stated: Let him who tied the 
bell on the tiger take it off. Unless the British side changes 
its uncooperative and antagonistic Hong Kong policy and 
withdraws the first-stage political structure draft which it has 
submitted to the Legislative Council, the Chinese side must 
otherwise accelerate its preparatory work, and, through the work 
of the Preliminary Work Committee [for the Preparatory Committee 
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region] and the 
concerted efforts of the Hong Kong people, China will ensure the 
smooth transition of Hong Kong. 
  Nevertheless, he stressed: The Preliminary Work Committee is 
a working organ. It is neither an organ of political power nor 
a shadow government. Hence, there is no question of replacing 
the Hong Kong Government. "In the situation in which the 
British side is not cooperative and there are just three and a 
half years left until 1997, the only way to guarantee a smooth 
transition is for the Hong Kong people and Preliminary Work 
Committee to intensify cooperation." 
<H5>  Patten Plays the Same Old Trick Before Quitting the Colony </H5>
  Ma Yuzhen accused Britain of playing the popular-will card 
with a view to realizing the "three violations." This is a 
replay of the small trick played by Britain every time in the 
past when quitting its colonies. The Chinese Government 
attaches importance to the opinions of the Hong Kong people and 
this can be seen from the fact that four years and eight months 
were spent soliciting the opinions of the Hong Kong people 
regarding the Basic Law, but the British Government has never 
valued the popular will in its rule over Hong Kong in the last 
100 years or so. 
  Ma Yuzhen took over the job of ambassador to Britain in 1991 
and has since then experienced the process of Sino-British 
relations turning from good to bad. He discussed his views. 
  One was that China attached importance to developing 
relations with Britain and regarded Britain as an important 
country which carried considerable weight [you fen liang 2589 
0433 6852] and maintenance of friendly relations with the latter 
as being conducive to world peace. "Although there are 
differences between China and Britain, they have common 
interests, such as a long-term interest in maintaining Hong 
Kong's prosperity and stability. The current situation of 
retrogression is something China does not want to see. China has 
never done anything harmful to its relations with Britain. The 
responsibility for this situation does not rest with the Chinese 
side." 
<H5>  Britain Undermines Sino-British Relations </H5>
  The other view was that in approaching Sino-British 
relations, it was necessary to review past events from a 
historical point of view. "During the 200 years from the visit 
to China of a British envoy in 1847 to the coming to Hong Kong 
of Patten as governor, Sino-British relations have been full of 
twists and turns. Before the Opium War, it can be said that the 
two countries treated each other as equals. However, from 1840 
to 1949, Britain invaded China using military force five times 
and China was thus in an unequal position of being invaded and 
bullied. 
  "In the early stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan, 
Britain recognized the state of Manchuria set up by Japan in 
northeast China and closed the Yunnan-Burma Railway when China 
was facing the most difficult times. It was after Japan 
attacked its colonies that Britain adopted a policy of opposing 
Japan. After 1949, Britain recognized China quite early on. It 
was not until 1972, when British Prime Minister Edward Heath 
adopted a farsighted China policy and normalized Sino-British 
relations, that the two countries began to exchange ambassadors. 
Relations between the two countries developed smoothly up to 
1989, when, together with other Western countries, Britain 
imposed comprehensive sanctions against China because of the 
Beijing disturbance." 
  Ma Yuzhen became ambassador to Britain in 1991, when China 
and Britain resumed contacts between high-level officials. His 
feelings about his work were that there were quite a few people 
of foresight in British political, industrial, and commercial 
circles, and they hoped to strengthen cooperation with China. 
He has all along worked happily. However, it was a pity that 
the formerly very good situation of cooperation between China 
and Britain was undermined by the change Britain made in its 
China policy in October 1992. 
<H3>  An Impact on Cooperation in Other Fields of Endeavor Is Hard 
To Avoid </H3>
  As far as the current relations between China and Britain 
are 
concerned, Ma Yuzhen advised the British Government, which had 
landed itself in a hole, to stop digging the hole and undo what 
it had done so far by quoting the former Labor Party Minister 
Dennis Healey as saying: "When you land yourself in a hole, you 
must stop digging the hole." 
  However, he added: The termination of Sino-British talks 
does not mean that the two countries do not have any normal 
diplomatic channels. The British side has violated the 
agreements on the issues of political structure and the new 
airport, adopted an uncooperative and antagonistic attitude, and 
undermined the cooperation between China and Britain step by 
step. Consequently, an impact on other aspects of Sino-British 
cooperation is hard to avoid. 
  He anticipated that it would be hard for Sino-British 
relations to take a turn for the better in the short term. 
However, he was fully confident that Hong Kong had a bright 
future. In 1997 Hong Kong would be able to revert to China 
smoothly. 
  After 1997, China also will be able to implement 
sovereignty, 
the Basic Law, and the one-country, two-systems concept to the 
letter. 
  "Cast away illusions, have greater confidence, step up 
preparatory work, heighten vigilance, guard against sabotage, 
and rely on the motherland." These are words of advice Chinese 
Ambassador to Britain Ma Yuzhen gave to the Hong Kong people.

<F P=106> [By reporter Ke Yan (0668 0917): "Jia Qinglin Says Fujian </F>
Must Accomplish New Feats"] 
  [Text] Fuzhou, 23 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Jia Qinglin, 
party secretary and governor of Fujian Province, pointed out in 
the forward which he has written for KAIFANG CHAO [Opening 
Tide], a large-scale economic journal soon to be published in 
the province, that if Fujian wants to accomplish new feats, it 
must expedite the implementation of the free port policy in 
Xiamen Special Economic Zone, appropriately and flexibly use the 
special policy on the two bonded zones in Xiamen and Fuzhou, and 
give full play to the role of the special and bonded zones in 
being the "window" and "base" amid opening up to the outside 
world. 
  He pointed out that at present, Fujian has a special 
economic 
zone, as well as some economic and technological development 
zones, Taiwan businessmen development zones, bonded zones, and 
nearly 100 small zones designated for comprehensive development 
by foreign businessmen; Fujian is one of the provinces with the 
largest number of opening spectrums, the most complete set of 
opening functions, and the biggest area covered by opening up. 
If Fujian wants to accomplish new feats, it must continue to 
give play to its strong point in land and marine resources, as 
well as its strong point in ties with overseas Chinese, Hong 
Kong, and Taiwan; it must adapt to the situation in which China 
is about to rejoin the GATT, and stretch its economic antenna to 
the broader international market. 
  Among the 13 bonded zones in the country, two are in Fujian. 
Fuzhou Bonded Zone has a planned area of 1.8 square km, and the 
first-phase development, which occupies 0.8 square km, has been 
in operation for more than a year; Xiamen's Xiangyu Bonded Zone 
has a planned area of 2 square km, and the first-phase 
development, which occupies 0.6 square km, was established last 
November and began operation at that time. Fuzhou Port, home to 
Fuzhou Bonded Zone, is only 149 nautical miles from Taiwan's 
Keelung Harbor, and is one of the mainland districts nearest to 
Taiwan; scholars generally hold that the bonded zone there 
should become an important base for interactions between the two 
sides of the straits. 
  KAIFANG CHAO, a large-scale bimonthly economic journal 
jointly run by Fujian Province People's Government Opening 
Affairs Office, Special Zone Office, and the Leading Team for 
Foreign Investment Work, is mainly for research and exploration 
into the theory and practice of opening up to the outside world. 
The journal will be published on 28 of every even-numbered 
month, and the trial issue to be published this month is a 
special issue on Fuzhou Bonded Zone.

  [Text] Provincial Party Secretary Yan Haiwang stressed the 
need to give prominence to focal points, overcome difficulties, 
and carry out all tasks in judicial work to create a stable and 
good social environment for Gansu's political stability and 
economic development. Yan Haiwang made an important speech at a 
provincial meeting on commending advanced collectives and 
individuals and on judicial work yesterday. 
  He said: Comprehensively implementing the party's basic line 
and preserving social and political stability are the main tasks 
in judicial work at present and are also new demands on judicial 
work in this new situation. Without a stable social and 
political environment, reform, opening up, and economic 
development will be impossible. Leaders at all levels must have 
a good idea of development trends, profoundly, thoroughly, and 
meticulously perform their work, and make earnest efforts to 
improve the legal system and supervision. They should formulate 
local laws and regulations to stimulate the healthy and stable 
development of the province's market economy. In the meantime, 
it is necessary to carry out severe crack downs on crime and to 
concentrate efforts on cracking major cases, curbing criminal 
gangs, and tracking down fugitives. We must fully display the 
functions of comprehensive management over social order. 
  Yan Haiwang pointed out: We must profoundly carry out the 
fight against corruption, resolutely crack down on all crimes in 
the economic field, and form a leadership contingent which is 
firm in politics, well versed in professional work, and sound in 
work style. 
  Provincial leaders present at the meeting were: Lu Kejian, 
Shen Xiaozeng, Yang Zhenjie, Yang Huaixiao, Hu Huie, and Wang 
Ping.

  [Text] Upon his return from trips to foreign countries, Ye 
Liansong, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and 
governor of the provincial government, gave a speech at the 
provincial judicial, procuratorial, and court work conference on 
30 January. 
  He said in his speech: At present, there are many problems 
in social order and in the many factors affecting stability. 
Serious economic crime cases, serious criminal cases, and the 
phenomena of social evil have yet to be put under effective 
control. The criminal cases of hooligans, robbers, and thefts 
continued to increase. Therefore, we must be neither blind nor 
optimistic about social order. We must keep from becoming 
careless or paralyzed ideologically or practically. 
  Ye Liansong said: The year 1994 is key to satisfactorily 
accomplishing the Eighth Five-Year Plan and to strive to fulfill 
the target of quadrupling the GNP ahead of schedule. On the 
basis of two consecutive years of fast economic development, we 
should continue to maintain rapid economic development. 
Therefore, the party committees and governments at various 
levels and the judicial, procuratorial, and court departments 
should accurately understand that development is the purpose, 
reform is the motivation, and stability is the prerequisite and 
grasp their dialectical relations. The party and government top 
leaders should ideologically understand the importance of 
stability as they understand reform and opening up. In doing 
their practical work, the party and government top leaders 
should exert real efforts to grasp stability as they do to grasp 
economic work. 
  Ye Liansong stressed: Safeguarding stability is the common 
task of the whole party and the whole society. So, the whole 
party and all social forces should be mobilized and make 
concerted efforts to comprehensively improve social order. 
  He urged: The party and government top leaders should not 
only be leaders for economic construction but also be the first 
to safeguard stability. We should strengthen the struggle for 
strictly dealing blows to criminal activities, expand the extent 
of attacks, and bring the rising tendencies of major cases under 
control. We should positively and actively wage the struggle 
against corruption and conscientiously investigate and handle 
major and appalling cases involving legal persons. 
Simultaneously, we should strengthen the construction of the 
contingent of the masses preventing and controlling criminal 
activities and enable it to come into full play as the first 
line of defense for eliminating contradictions, preventing 
crimes, and stabilizing society.

<F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] Deng Rong, the youngest daughter of China's 
paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, has started work on the second 
volume of her best-selling biography of her father. 
  Ms Deng, who writes under the pen name "Mao Mao," told the 
Shanxi Youth newspaper she was gathering reference materials for 
the book and expected it to be completed within the next couple 
of years. 
  It will focus on the latter half of Mr Deng's life, a period 
in which he was purged twice during the Cultural Revolution 
before finally taking absolute control of the Communist Party in 
1976. 
  Ms Deng described her father's later years as "the brightest 
and most glorious chapter" in his life. 
  The first volume, published last August, has already 
reportedly sold more than 20 million copies. Most were bought 
up by government offices and work units eager to show their 
enthusiasm for China's "chief architect of reform". 
  The new biography would rely to a greater extent on Ms 
Deng's 
personal experience rather than historical documents and the 
memories of her parents which formed the basis of the first 
volume, she said. 
  "I know a lot more and have a greater understanding of the 
second half of father's life," Ms Deng, who was born in 1950 
when her father was 46, told the newspaper. 
  However, it is unclear just how much detail about the 
factional intrigues which led to the downfall of her father in 
the Cultural Revolution Ms Deng will provide in her new personal 
account of his life. 
  Most analysts are not expecting any major revelations in the 
book, rather a subtle reworking of recent history to finally 
establish a definitive place for Mr Deng in the annals of the 
Communist Party. 
  "All this publicity about the life and works of Deng is 
clearly designed to shape Deng's legacy before he finally dies 
and thus hopefully ensure his ideas are not abandoned," a 
Western diplomat said.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter He Jun: "Call To Develop Minority </F>
Districts"] 
  [Text] The ethnic minority policy will be guided by the 
principles of unity, progress, stability and development, the 
State Nationalities Affairs Commission conference was told 
yesterday. 
  If these principles are followed ethnic relations will 
improve and China's national unity and social stability will be 
protected, Commission Vice-Chairman Chen Hong said. 
  Inter-ethnic relations improved markedly last year, as 
economic developments began to spread from the coastal areas to 
the interior and border regions, Chen said. 
  But increasing contact between the different nationality 
cultures had led to unavoidable arguments and conflict, 
Commission Minister Ismail Amat told the conference. 
  Amat urged central and local nationalities affairs 
departments to strengthen their conflict resolution work so as 
to safeguard social stability. 
  And he encouraged his colleagues to continue the fight 
against hostile forces from inside and outside China that 
attempted to split the country by playing the ethnic issue card. 
  Another national conference will be held in September this 
year to honour individuals and collectives that have made 
outstanding contributions to the unity and progress of Chinese 
nationalities, Chen said. 
  And he encouraged local government to arrange forums to push 
forward the nationalities work. And they should select nominees 
for the national honours. 
  Amat stressed the need to further strengthen the legislation 
on nationalities affairs and promote the reform and opening up 
in the ethnic regions.

  [Text] One of the top "black hands" of Tiananmen Square is 
back in China, promoting education and criticising the country's 
intellectuals. 
  Zhou Duo who had worried about being allowed back after a 
year's stint in the United States is trying to set up a 
foundation to finance education. 
  In Shenzhen last week, he said he would get the foundation 
going no matter what the government thought of it. 
  "Although there is an official education foundation called 
Project Hope, it is not enough to solve all the problems," he 
said. 
  His foundation, he said, would try to raise the quality of 
education. This was not confrontational towards the government, 
he said. 
  He said he had good connections with some private 
enterprises 
and was confident he could raise the necessary funds. 
  Mr Zhou, a prominent sociologist, was one of the prime 
movers 
of the Tiananmen Square protest in June 1989. 
  Describing himself as a moderate, he said he supported rule 
by the Communist Party for now. 
  "There is no alternative party powerful enough to take over 
from the Communist Party, so there is no choice but to support 
it for the sake of stability," he said. 
  But he thought the party should relax its grip on the media 
and allow opposition parties to flourish. The party should 
eliminate dictatorship and become "open-minded" to save itself. 
  Mr Zhou suggested a step-by-step reform for the party, 
allowing popular elections in localities, introducing rule by 
law and strengthening the powers of the National People's 
Congress, giving up some of its monopoly on benefits and sharing 
them with the people. 
  He is concerned about stability in the post-Deng Xiaoping 
era 
and has urged experimentation in various styles of government. 
  Mr Zhou said intellectuals should get more involved in the 
modernisation drive. 
  He said a hands-off attitude on the part of intellectuals 
had 
allowed Mao Zedong's disastrous Cultural Revolution. 
  Intellectuals now were too absorbed in their professions and 
too short-sighted, he said. 
  Mr Zhou said intellectuals could help out in the 
modernisation drive through education. Intellectuals should 
help the government in that area, he said. 
  "Education is very important in promoting a democracy among 
the people. China cannot build a really democratic system with 
a population which is poorly-educated and which does not 
understand what is rational," he said. 
  During his stay in the U.S., mainly at Harvard as a visiting 
scholar, he was impressed by the sight of primary students being 
taken into Congress to learn about democracy. 
  Mr Zhou said he developed a great admiration for the 
American 
system, impressed by people's politeness and the efficiency of 
the administration. But he missed China. 
  "My heart beat faster every time I read the overseas edition 
of the PEOPLE's DAILY. I missed China so much. Now I'm so very 
glad to be back on the soil of my own country."

  [Text] One thousand copies of Tendency Quarterly have been 
confiscated by local police authorities because the content of 
the magazine smacked of rightist tendency, the editor said. 
  Bei Ling, 34, editor-in-chief of the quarterly, said police 
authorities maintained the literature quarterly contained some 
"questionable" content. 
  A veteran dissident in the democratic wall movement of 1979, 
Mr Bei was questioned at Shanghai airport and interrogated in 
Shenzhen for three days last week. 
  The police did not identify the magazine as reactionary. 
  Police especially questioned one article, `The Nightmare of 
the Post-Communist', written by Czech President Vaclav Havel and 
translated by Shen Tong, an active dissident of the 1989 
pro-democracy movement. 
  The magazine was blamed for publishing Chinese literature 
written by dissidents. 
  It reports dissident poets such as Meng Lang and Mo Mo and 
the prominent dissident writers in exile--Liu Qin Zheng Yi and 
Bei Ming. 
  Mr Bei said 2,500 copies will be published in Hong Kong and 
overseas.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Lei (1728 7191)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing 25 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--The premiere 
of the eight-part television film series entitled "Talk About 
the Population Issue in Length and Breadth," comprising 
voluminous shocking facts and heartbreaking scenes, was held in 
Beijing today. Many demographers and television artists believed 
it to be "comprehensive, profound and vibrant, a fine political 
essay in television film, and a vivid text book for perception 
through the senses." 
  The TV series in question is a joint production effort of 
the 
Fujian Provincial Census Office and the Fujian North-and-South 
Telefilm Center; it depicts the population crisis, one of the 
five major crises of mankind in the 20th Century, and the 
sternest topic in contemporary Chinese society, on the TV 
screen, and sounds the alarm on the population issue in the 
economic upsurge. The TV series is China's first attempt to 
make profound analyses on a series of issues the population 
issue involves, which are closely linked to the Chinese people, 
such as the environmental issue, nationals' qualities, 
education, housing, resources, aging, and population flow. 
  At the ceremonies of the premiere held today, related 
experts 
stated that "the series is a piece of great work that aims at 
revealing social issues rarely seen in recent years, thus 
pushing Chinese telefilms with themes on social issues to a new 
level." Fei Xiaotong, the State Family Planning Commission, and 
the State Statistics Bureau highly appraised the TV series, 
believing that it was an important result in the excavation and 
utilization of the fourth census data, "and an educational 
document on the national demographic condition with artistic 
value which affords great delight." 
  Chen Lin [7115 3829], the telefilm series' producer and 
Fujian Provincial Census Office director, gave a briefing on the 
making of the series on behalf of the production team at the 
premiere. The shooting of the film began in Fuzhou in October 
1992; the production team covered a distance of some 10,000 km, 
with their footsteps covering 13 provinces and cities; aside 
from collecting much precious historical date, they also shoot 
many heartbreaking scenes on location. 
  Famous scientist Fei Xiaotong, NPC Standing Committee vice 
chairman; and State Councillor Peng Peiyun, concurrently State 
Family Planning Commission minister; and State Statistics Bureau 
Director Zhang Sai were general advisors of the series. Fujian 
telefilm director Su Zhong [5685 11813] was the chief director.

<F P=106> [By Li Desheng (2621 1795 3932): "From the Lushan Meeting </F>
to the 13 September Incident"] 
  [Text] Beginning in 1969, I worked under the direct 
leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong for more than four years, and 
this was the most unforgettable experience of my life. 
  In this article I am going to narrate some historical facts 
I 
personally witnessed in the struggle led by Comrade Mao Zedong 
against the Lin Biao Counterrevolutionary Clique in 
commemoration of that great person. 
  In July 1969 the party central leadership decided to 
transfer 
me to work in Beijing. At that time I was an alternate member 
of the Central Committee's Political Bureau. At first I was 
appointed to work in the Routine Work Group [ye wu zu 2814 0523 
4809] of the State Council and in the Executive Group [ban shi 
zu 6586 0057 4809] of the Central Military Commission. I was 
concurrently first secretary of the Anhui Provincial CPC 
Committee. Sometime later I was also appointed to be director 
of the General Political Department of the People's Liberation 
Army. 
  In August 1970, on the eve of the Second Plenary Session of 
the Ninth CPC Central Committee, I went to Anhui's Huaibei area, 
where production remained in a backward condition, to conduct 
investigations and studies for nearly a month. There, I 
received the meeting notice and directly went to Lushan from 
Anhui. 
  The Second Plenary Session of the Ninth CPC Central 
Committee 
opened on 23 August 1970. Chairman Mao presided over that day's 
meeting, and Premier Zhou announced the three subjects on the 
plenum's agenda, namely, the revision of the PRC Constitution, 
the formulation of the national economic plan, and the issue of 
war preparations. 
  According to the announced agenda, Kang Sheng should deliver 
a report on the draft of the Constitution, but at this moment, 
Lin Biao spoke. Although the agenda announced by Premier Zhou 
did not list Lin Biao's speech, as Lin was then vice chairman of 
the party Central Committee, it was regarded as normal if he 
spoke ahead of Kang Sheng. In his speech, Lin Biao talked a lot 
about Chairman Mao's genius. He said: "Chairman Mao's status 
of being a great leader, head of state, and supreme commander" 
is a "feature" of the new Constitution. Such a leading position 
"must be recognized by all people except some extremely 
counterrevolutionaries at home and abroad." That evening after 
Lin Biao's speech, at the meeting of the Political Bureau to 
discuss the outline of the national economic plan, Wu Faxian 
suddenly proposed that people attending the plenum of the 
Central Committee the next day listen to the recording of Lin 
Biao's speech and discuss this speech. The plenum thus made 
such an arrangement. 
  The next day problems arose in the discussions of various 
groups. People who had ganged up around Lin Biao spoke 
separately in the north China group, the central and south China 
group, the southwest China group, and the northwest China group 
to express the same opinions according to the arrangements made 
by Ye Qun beforehand. They all advocated the theory of genius 
and insisted on setting the post of state president and electing 
Chairman Mao to be state president. 
  Before that, Chairman Mao had officially proposed that no 
state presidency be set, and this had also been discussed and 
approved by the Political Bureau. So comrades in the Political 
Bureau were all aware of this. It was impossible that Lin Biao 
was unaware of this. However, why did he mention this again at 
the plenum? 
  In order to support this action, Chen Boda and Ye Qun had 
long made preparations. After going up to Lushan, they hastily 
collected some quotations. After Chen Boda's selection, they 
compiled a document entitled "Some Quotations of Engels, Lenin, 
and Chairman Mao on Genius" overnight and then distributed it to 
some people. The day after Lin Biao spoke, in addition to the 
several generals commanded by Ye Qun, Chen Boda also made a 
speech in the north China group. He even said: "A very small 
number of people even denounced the thesis that Comrade Mao 
Zedong has comprehensively defended and developed 
Marxism-Leninism in a talented and creative way as an "irony.'" 
"Some people tried to use Chairman Mao's greatness and modesty 
to belittle Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought." "Some 
counterrevolutionaries were very glad to hear that Chairman Mao 
would not be state president, and they even danced for joy!" In 
order to act as quickly as possible to support Lin Biao, he 
distributed his speech in the north China group's second 
briefing on the morning of 25 August. As Lin Biao was vice 
chairman of the party, many people thought that Lin's speech was 
endorsed by Chairman Mao, and as Chen Boda was a member of the 
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau, his speech was also 
rather weighty. The distribution of the briefing changed the 
atmosphere of the plenum. People discussed it inside and 
outside the meetings and the agenda was completely disrupted. 
The intensification of the contradictions forced Chairman Mao 
to personally make a ruling. 
  What was to be done at the next step at the plenum? People 
were deeply concerned. 
  On the afternoon of 25 August, the Standing Committee of the 
Political Bureau held an enlarged meeting which was attended by 
all group leaders. Chairman Mao took a resolute action and 
announced three instructions at the meeting. 
  First, the plenum should be adjourned immediately, and the 
discussion on Lin Biao's speech at the opening meeting should be 
stopped. Second, the north China group's second briefing should 
be retrieved. Third, no people should be purged, and unity 
should be kept according to the spirit of the ninth party 
congress, because Chen Boda's speech in the north China group 
violated the guideline laid down by the ninth party congress. 
Chairman Mao then sternly said: If you continue to act in this 
way, I will leave Lushan and you may continue to stir up trouble 
as you like. No one should continue to mention the issue of 
setting up a state presidency. Those who insist on setting up a 
state presidency may take the post themselves. Anyway, I will 
never be state president! He also told Lin Biao: I advise you 
not to take the state presidency as well, and those who insist 
on setting such a post should take it themselves! 
  Several days after that, Premier Zhou relayed Chairman Mao's 
instruction to me: I should return to Beijing to take charge of 
the work of the Executive Group of the Central Military 
Commission so that Huang Yongsheng could go to Lushang and 
attend the meeting. Comrade Li Xiannian also returned to Beijing 
to replace Comrade Ji Dengkui so he could attend the meeting at 
Lushan. 
  After returning to Beijing, I was not quite clear about the 
happenings at the plenum, and I was told later about what 
happened there. On 1 September Chairman Mao wrote "My Opinion" 
at Lushan, and the writing was sent to Beijing. I carefully read 
it many times. Chairman Mao's essay pointed out the nature of 
the event and openly criticized Chen Boda, but it still 
"protected" Lin Biao and left an opportunity for him to correct 
his mistakes. 
  On 16 December, according to Chairman Mao's opinion, the 
Political Bureau decided to hold the North China conference to 
further expose Chen Boda's mistakes. The conference lasted from 
22 December 1970 to 24 January 1971. At the conference, on 
behalf of the party central leadership, Premier Zhou 
systematically exposed Chen Boda's crimes and announced the 
party Central Committee's decision on reorganizing the leading 
body of the Beijing Military Region. I was appointed to be 
commander of the Beijing Military Region, and Ji Dengkui was 
appointed to be its political commissar. Before the announcement 
of my new appointment, Chairman Mao personally talked with me. 
  On the basis of the north China conference, the central 
leadership prepared another report meeting to criticize Chen and 
party rectification. Premier Zhou led me and Huang Yongsheng, 
Wu Faxian, Li Zuopeng, and Qiu Huizuo to see Lin Biao in 
Beidaihe. Premier Zhou told me the purpose of our trip was to 
relay Chairman Mao's opinion on telling Lin Biao to attend the 
forthcoming report meeting criticizing Chen and party 
rectification. We were going to say something so that he might 
act in a face-saving way. 
  When we met with Lin Biao in Beidaihe, he only told Huang, 
Wu, Li, Qiu to make self-criticism, but he himself still refused 
to admit his own mistake and did not express his willingness to 
attend the meeting. 
  After returning from Beidaihe, Premier Zhou again took us to 
see Chairman Mao, and reported what happened in Beidaihe to the 
chairman. After listening to our report, Chairman Mao sternly 
criticized Huang, Wu, Li, and Qiu to their faces: "You have 
moved to the brink of the precipice! Are you going to jump or 
be pushed down the precipice? Or are you willing to be pulled 
back? All will depend on yourselves!" Chairman Mao was also 
unsatisfied with Lin Biao's attitude, but he did not say 
anything before Huang, Wu, Li, and Qiu. 
  In the campaign of criticizing Chen Boda and rectifying the 
party's style, Chairman Mao read a large quantity of materials 
and found that the activities of Lin Biao and company were 
extremely suspicious. He decided to make an inspection tour to 
the south in order to further find out the facts and to make 
some preparations for the convention of the forthcoming Third 
Plenary Session of the Ninth CPC Central Committee. 
  On 14 August 1971 Chairman Mao left Beijing and started his 
inspection tour to the south. He first arrived in Wuhan, and 
then went to Changsha, Nanchang, and Hangzhou. In his journey 
he met with local party, government, and military leaders, and 
mainly talked with them about the struggle beginning from the 
Lushan meeting in 1970. He pointed out: "At the Lushan 
meeting, they launched a sudden attack and carried out 
underground activities. Why did they not dare to act openly? 
Because they had a guilty conscience. Their sudden attack and 
underground activities were all conducted in an organized and 
planned way according to a certain guideline, and the guideline 
was to set the state presidency and to advocate `genius' for the 
purpose of opposing the line laid down by the ninth party 
congress and to overturn the three-point agenda for the Second 
Plenary Session of the Ninth CPC Central Committee. A certain 
person was anxious to become state president, and tried to split 
the party and to usurp the power." "Comrade Lin Biao did not 
consult me before he made his speech, and he did not let me read 
his script beforehand." He added: "This time, Vice Chairman 
Lin should still be protected, and no conclusion was made on 
blaming him. Of course, he should still bear certain 
responsibility. What should be done to other people involved? 
Our principle remains one for educating the erring people. 
That is, `learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, and 
cure the sickness to save the patient.'" 
  After arriving in Nanchang on 31 August, Chairman Mao was 
told that Zhou Yuchi, a backbone member of Lin Biao's clique, 
transported an amphibious vehicle away from Jiangxi by plane. 
This aroused his vigilance. On 3 September, he left Nanchang 
for Hangzhou. 
  When talking with local responsible comrades on the journey, 
Chairman Mao repeatedly stressed that his words must not be 
revealed to other people who were not present. However, on 5 
September, when Li Zuopeng accompanied foreign visitors to 
Wuhan, Liu Feng revealed Chairman Mao's words to Li. The next 
day, as soon as he returned to Beijing, Li passed the message to 
Huang Yongsheng and Qiu Huizuo. Huang told Ye Qun on the 
telephone. Late on the evening of 5 September Lin Biao's 
underlings in Guangzhou secretly reported the contents of 
Chairman Mao's talk to Beijing's Yu Xinye, who took 15 pages of 
notes. On 6 September Yu personally flew a helicopter to 
Beidaihe and delivered the notes of the telephone report to Lin 
Biao, Ye Qun, and Lin Liguo. The information from the two 
difference sources shocked Lin Biao and company like a bolt from 
the blue. Being startled, they decided to lay murderous hands 
on Chairman Mao. 
  On 8 September, Lin Biao personally wrote an order with a 
red 
pencil: "Act according to the order relayed by Comrade Liguo 
and Comrade Yuchi." At the same time, Ye Qun wrote a 
confidential letter to be personally opened by Huang Yongsheng: 
"The current situation is critical. We have decided to take 
action in Shanghai." When the criminals were tried later, they 
confessed that Lin Liguo and his accomplices worked out three 
methods of assassinating Chairman Mao: First, to use 
flamethrowers and bazookas to attack the train carrying Chairman 
Mao; second, to use 100-mm antiaircraft guns against the train; 
third, to order Wang Weiguo, political commissar of the Fourth 
Air Force Army in Shanghai, to carry a pistol in to see Chairman 
Mao on the train and take action during the meeting. 
  After coming to Hangzhou, Chairman Mao had the train moved 
to 
Shaoxing. On 10 September, Chairman Mao suddenly decided to set 
off in the afternoon without asking any local people to see him 
off. More than three hours later, the train arrived in Shanghai. 
He did not leave the train; instead, he told his assistants to 
telephone Xu Shiyou and summon him to Shanghai. The next 
morning, the chairman talked with Xu Shiyou and Wang Hongwen on 
the train. After the talk, he asked Wang Hongwen to lead Xu 
Shiyou to the Jinjiang Hotel and have lunch there. As soon as 
Wang Dongxing returned from seeing them off, Chairman Mao told 
him: "We should depart now, and no need to notify them. The 
train should go now, and nobody should be notified. Let the 
vanguard train move first." 
  From 8 to 11 September, Lin Liguo, Zhou Yuchi, and other 
accomplices gathered in a small bungalow of Beijing's Xijiao 
Airport, and continued to plan the assassination of Chairman 
Mao. Some of them proposed setting fire to Shanghai's Hongqiao 
Airport and taking advantage of the chaotic condition to kill 
the chairman. Some of them proposed the use of flamethrowers to 
burn the chairman to death, some people proposed using military 
planes to drop bombs, and another option was to lay explosives 
on the Suofang Bridge near Suzhou to blow up the 
train....However, before they had enough time to carry out the 
bridge explosion plan, Chairman Mao's special train had safely 
passed the bridge and sped northward without stopping. The train 
passed Bangbu, Jinan, and Tianjin. Then Chairman Mao ordered 
the train to stop, and told Zhang Yaoci to telephone Li Desheng, 
Ji Dengkui, Wu De, and Wu Zhong, and summon them to the Fengtai 
Railway Station. 
  At 12 o'clock on 12 September 1971 we met with Chairman Mao 
in his special train in the Fengtai Railway Station. Comrade 
Wang Dongxing was also present. Although the chairman was 
somewhat tired after returning from the long journey to the 
south and was considering the struggle against Lin Biao and his 
company, he was still in a good mood and still talked in a 
humorous way. He said: "They launched a sudden attack on 
Lushan, and even tried to blast the mountain to pieces and stop 
the rotation of the earth....The issue of genius is a 
theoretical issue, and they held a viewpoint of idealism on this 
issue....A genius is just a bit cleverer, and a genius still 
must follow the mass line and rely on collective wisdom....What 
nonsense, talking about the peak and saying that each sentence I 
said could match 10,000 sentences other people said....I 
mentioned six times that there is no need to set up a state 
presidency. If one sentence could match 10,000 sentences, then 
there were 60,000 sentences. However, he still did not hear 
even half a sentence. There was no effect at all." Then 
Chairman Mao faced me and said: "You may ask them about the 
materials they distributed in Lushan, and may ask them three 
times a year: 'Why didn't you give me your treasured object?' 
And see what they would say!" Chairman Mao referred to the 
fact that they did not deliver the collection of quotations on 
"genius" they compiled in Lushan. At a meeting I mentioned this, 
and at that time Chairman Mao said: "You should ask them to give 
it to you!" After that, he always remembered this. Then, 
Chairman Mao added: "Chen Boda was not the only evil backstage 
manipulator [hei shou 7815 2087], there was still someone else." 
This remark hinted Lin Biao. 
  Finally, Chairman Mao told me to carry out a task: 
Transferring one division of troops to Nankou. At that moment, 
Chairman Mao was not only alert, but also began to make concrete 
arrangements because he had expected the worst possibility that 
Lin Biao and his company might stage an armed coup d'etat. 
After saying goodbye to the chairman, I immediately arranged 
the transfer of one division. 
  I did not expect a serious incident to occur that very 
night. 
  On the evening of 12 September I attended a meeting at the 
Great Hall of the People. The meeting was chaired by Premier 
Zhou, and the subject of discussion was the government work 
report to be delivered to the forthcoming session of the Fourth 
National People's Congress. 
  After 2200, the security guards in Beidaihe directly 
telephoned the premier, saying that Lin Biao, Ye Qun, and Lin 
Liguo would leave Shanhaiguan by plane, and the departure time 
would be 0600 the next morning (13 September) and the 
destination would be Guangzhou. Belonging to the same clique, 
Huang Yongsheng, Wu Faxian, Li Zuopeng, and Qiu Huizuo also 
planned to set off from Beijing at the same time the next 
morning. The premier paid close attention to the development of 
events, and felt that the developments went beyond his 
expectations. He frowned and told the guards to closely watch 
the happenings and report them to him at any time. Then, the 
premier immediately asked Wu Faxian why a Trident flew to 
Shanhaiguan, and ordered that the plane fly back immediately 
without taking any people back to Beijing. Wu Faxian spoke 
evasively and told a lie to the premier, saying that the plane 
was carrying out the task of night flying test and could not 
return because of a certain breakdown. Premier Zhou ordered: 
"The plane must not be allowed to move and must remain there, 
and must return as soon as the breakdown is fixed." 
  At that moment, Lin Biao and Ye Qun were aware that Premier 
Zhou was inquiring about the movement of the Trident, and became 
more panic-stricken. In order to conceal their plot of fleeing 
to Guangzhou, at 2322 Ye Qun deliberately telephoned Premier 
Zhou: "Vice Chairman Lin wants to move." The premier asked: 
"Move by air or on the ground?" Ye Qun answered: "By air." 
The premier asked: "Do you have a plane?" Ye Qun said: "No." 
Ye Qun's answer gave herself away. At that moment, the premier 
knew that not only did the Trident-256 remain in Shanhaiguan, 
they had also dispatched an Il-14 to that place." Ye Qun's lie 
proved that they had plotted to flee to the south. Premier Zhou 
immediately called Li Zuopeng (because Shanhaiguan Airport was 
managed by the Navy): "Special plane No 256 at the Shanhaiguan 
Airport must not be allowed to move; only with an order jointly 
issued by you, Huang Yongsheng, Wu Faxian, and me can the plane 
take off." However, Li Zuopeng tampered with the premier's 
order, and changed it into "only with the orders of one of the 
four leaders can the plane take off." At that moment, the 
premier frequently walked in and out, and I knew that something 
must be happening." 
  At 0032 on 13 September the security guards in Beidaihe 
reported that Lin Biao disregarded the obstruction of the guards 
and forcefully made the plane take off! The Shanhaiguan Airport 
reported this to Li Zuopeng three times and asked him what to do 
if the plane attempted to take off. However, Li Zuopeng did not 
issue an order to obstruct the plane. When Premier Zhou was 
told about this, he immediately telephoned Chairman Mao to 
report this to him and ask for instructions. After returning to 
our room, the premier told me that Lin Biao had fled by plane! 
He ordered me to rush to the Air Force Headquarters of the 
Central Military Commission to assume personal command on his 
behalf, and ordered me to report the situation to him without 
delay. The premier also instructed me that I must not leave the 
command post 24 hours a day. In fact, I did not leave Air Force 
Headquarters for five consecutive days and nights. At the same 
time, the premier sent Comrade Yang Dezhou to follow Wu Faxian 
to the Xijiao Airport (in fact, keeping watch on Wu's action) to 
control the situation. He also sent Comrade Ji Dengkui to 
control the Air Force Headquarters of the Beijing Military 
Region. The premier also issued a "no-fly order": "All 
airports throughout the country must be closed; no plane is 
allowed to take off. All radars must be set in motion to 
monitor the skies." I rushed to Air Force Headquarters, jumped 
out of my car, and rushed into the combat command office. 
There, I summoned Liang Pu, chief of staff of the Air Force, 
and both of us stared at the huge radar screen that covered the 
whole wall. At that moment, on the screen, I clearly saw the 
moving bright spot which indicated the position of the plane. 
It was moving between Chengdeng and the Sino-Mongolian 
borderline. 
  Premier Zhou asked the control officer: "Can they hear you 
if you call plane 256 through radio?" 
  The control officer answered: "Yes, they can." 
  The premier said: "I need to talk to Pan Jingyin (we already 
knew that Pan was the plane's pilot), please put me through." 
  The control officer said: "He turned on the radio, but did 
not reply." 
  The premier said: "Then, please call plane 256 and tell them 
that we want them to fly back, and they may land at either 
Dongjiao Airport or Xijiao Airport in Beijing. I, Zhou Enlai, 
will meet them at the airport." 
  The control officer reported: "He did not answer." 
  The plane took a tricky course. It first flew westward, and 
then turned to the north. 
  Liang Pu and I nervously watched the huge screen. Liang Pu 
said: "The plane is not flying in a normal condition." I 
asked: "What do you mean?" Liang said: "First, it is not 
flying along any international course; second, it is flying 
northward, and will soon cross the border and enter Mongolia; 
third, it is flying at a low altitude." I sat at a huge desk. 
It was the commanding room of the Air Force, and there is a red 
telephone through which I could directly call the premier. I 
continuously reported to him the position, altitude, flying 
direction of the plane. When I asked him how to handle the 
event, he told me that he had asked Chairman Mao for 
instructions. The chairman said: As the skies want to drop 
rains and the mother wants to remarry herself, let him go as he 
likes. 
  On the early morning of 13 September, the plane flew out of 
China. 
  I reported this to the premier immediately. 
  At 0315 that morning, a report came from Shahe Airport: "A 
helicopter just took off and flew northward toward Zhangjiakou." 
I again immediately reported this to the premier. After asking 
Chairman Mao for instructions, the premier instructed: "Effect 
a forced landing. If it refuses to land, shoot it down!" I 
ordered the Air Force of the Beijing Military Region to dispatch 
eight Jian- 6 fighters to intercept the helicopter and forced it 
to land in Huairou County. Zhou Yuchi killed Comrade Chen 
Xiuwen, who drove the helicopter back, and then committed 
suicide together with Yu Xinye. Li Weixin was captured alive. 
  What would happen after Lin Biao's plane flew out of China? 
At that moment it was expected that Lin Biao might flee to the 
Soviet Union. Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou made arrangements 
against all consequences caused by the incident. 
  Local leaders must also be informed of the Lin Biao incident 
as soon as possible in order to cope with any contingencies. 
The premier personally phoned the principal leaders of all 
military regions, provinces, autonomous regions, and 
municipalities and informed them of the happenings in an 
implicit but clear way. 
  After all the arrangements were made, Premier Zhou had 
worked 
more than 50 consecutive hours without rest. At 1400 on the 
afternoon of 14 September, shortly after the premier fell 
asleep, the Foreign Ministry delivered an urgent telegram from 
the Chinese embassy in Mongolia. We could hardly awaken the 
premier. He asked the secretary to read the telegram. When he 
heard that Lin Biao's Trident-256 had crashed somewhere near 
Ondorhaan in Mongolia, he immediately reported this to Chairman 
Mao. 
  I started organizing the investigation that night. According 
to Li Weixin's confession, we searched his residence and found a 
large quantity of evidence of the Lin Biao Counterrevolutionary 
Clique's crimes. Among other things, there was the "Outline of 
Project 571," a plan for assassinating Chairman Mao. There was 
also plenty of evidence showing that they planned to set up 
another central power organ in south China. I immediately sent 
some people to deliver the evidence to Premier Zhou and Chairman 
Mao. 
  In the Air Force, a five-member group headed by Comrade Cao 
Lihuai was set up to assist me. 
  In the course of the investigation, Chairman Mao stressed 
the 
need to act according to established policies, and repeatedly 
told us that only a very small number of people were Lin Biao's 
diehard followers, and the concrete historical conditions for 
most erring comrades should be considered. At that time, as Lin 
Biao was the party's vice chairman, people were not aware of his 
conspiracy. So it is necessary to carry out the policy of 
learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, and curing the 
sickness to save the patient when handling the erring comrades. 
They should be forgiven as long as they correct their mistakes. 
  Concretely speaking, should all the tens of assistants and 
secretaries working with Lin Biao be fired? I don't think this 
is a proper way. Explanation should be given to them so that 
they may receive reeducation and then be assigned to other 
posts. They should not be fired, because they were sent by the 
party to work with Lin Biao. 
  Chairman Mao's instructions ensured the smooth development 
of 
the investigation. 
  After the 13 September Incident, Chairman Mao seriously 
reexamined various events during the Cultural Revolution, and 
personally corrected some ultra-leftist practices. For example, 
he instructed us to rehabilitate as many cadres as possible and 
to do this as soon as possible. The old marshals and many old 
comrades who were sent to other provinces by Lin Biao under the 
pretext of "evacuation for the purpose of war preparations" were 
successively allowed to return to Beijing. 
  After that, Chairman Mao also personally examined many 
petitions and letters of appeal for the rehabilitation of old 
cadres, and wrote his instructions on them. He entrusted such 
affairs to the General Political Department. Under the 
leadership of Premier Zhou and Marshal Ye, we did a great deal 
of arduous work, thwarted the obstruction of the "Gang of Four," 
and rehabilitated a large number of senior officers in the armed 
forces.

  Party and administrative penalties were meted out to five 
leading members with party membership at prefectural and county

  [Text] Beijing, Jan 31 (AFP) -- The People's Liberation 
Army [PLA] has been told by the communist party leadership to 
step in line behind the ideals of socialism. 
  The PLA's powerful political department has issued a 
circular, published on the front page of newspapers here Monday, 
calling on the military to stand four square behind current 
economic reforms. The call for loyalty follows a series of 
similar appeals to rank and file party members and leading 
social figures issued by senior leaders during last week's 
national conference on ideology and the media. 
  The meeting was the most important since 1957 which led to 
purges against rightists. 
  Emphasising that the "new situation had created new 
problems" 
-- an implication that accelerated economic reforms this year 
could bring the risk of social instability -- the circular 
called on all army units to back the programme and to work to 
strengthen the "socialist spiritual civilisation." The text 
called on soldiers to be in the "forefront of patriotism," to 
study the works of Deng Xiaoping and publicise the Communist 
Party central committee's decisions. 
  The party also called on soldiers to follow the example of 
soldier Lei Feng, a legendary hero of the 60s who devoted his 
life to the motherland and the party before his death aged 22. 
The military should study the spirit of Lei Feng and improve 
their ideological knowledge, it said. 
  Last week, before an assembly of PLA veterans, party chief 
Jiang Zemin told the armed forces to remain united behind the 
party. 
  Chinese leaders are visibly concerned about the threat of 
social, or even political unrest this year as economic reforms 
speed up, somewhat unevenly. Deng also celebrates his 90th 
birthday in August this year. Many foreign and Chinese analysts 
fear his death could bring chaos to the country. In the event of 
unrest, the party leaders want to be able to count on the armed 
forces to ensure the system does not collapse around them.

<F P=106> [By reporter Su Ruozhou (5685 5387 5297): "People's </F>
Liberation Army General Staff Headquarters Makes Arrangements 
for Troop Management in the New Year"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 19 Jan (JIEFANGJUN BAO)--At the beginning 
of the new year, the General Staff Headquarters made 
arrangements for troop management of the entire armed forces in 
the new year. It urged the entire armed forces to put troop 
management in an important position and tomake efforts to do the 
job well. It stressed the necessity of taking thoroughly 
studying the characteristics and laws of leading troops in the 
new period as the point for making a breakthrough and of 
focusing efforts on resolving questions of how to manage cadres 
and how to lead soldiers in a bid to further strengthen and 
improve troop management. 
  The General Staff Headquarters pointed out that our army 
building was being carried out in a new historical period. The 
development and changes of the general environment of the 
society and the mission of military struggle of our armed forces 
in the new period had provided new opportunities and conditions 
for doing a good job in troop management and had, at the same 
time, set higher new demands. In the new situation, how to 
manage cadres and how to lead soldiers have become focal 
questions in the course of doing a good job in troop management 
and must be seriously studied and resolved. Strengthening and 
improving troop management has a bearing on the comprehensive 
work of army building in all aspects and is the common 
responsibility of party committees, leadership, and organs at 
all levels. It is necessary to earnestly strengthen leadership; 
pool the strength of all sectors; do solid work; keep abreast of 
new situations; explore new measures; ensure strict discipline, 
good work style, normal order, security and stability in the 
armed forces,;and strive to increase the cohesive force and 
enhance the combat capacity of the armed forces. 
  The General Staff Headquarters urged officers and soldiers 
of 
the entire armed forces to earnestly study and implement Deng 
Xiaoping's ideas on army building in the new period and a series 
of instructions on strengthening troop management given by 
Chairman Jiang Zemin, to carry out thorough studies and analyses 
on new situations and new characteristics of management work 
closely centering round how to manage cadres and how to lead 
soldiers in the new situation, especially under the conditions 
of developing the socialist market economy, and to put forward 
methods for solving problems. Various units should study and 
answer the following questions in light of reality: How to do a 
good job in education and management of cadres and to 
comprehensively improve the basic quality of leaders of troops; 
how to unify carrying forward fine traditions and using modern 
management science; and how to study and master methods for 
leading troops that suit the characteristics of the soldiers, 
keeping in mind changes in the composition of soldiers in the 
new period; how to better implement the policy of exercising 
strict management of the armed forces according to law, 
implement decrees, regulations, and rules, correct lax 
management, loose work style, slackened discipline, and bring 
about a fundamental change for the better in style and 
discipline; how to uphold the principle of "unity between 
officers and men" in the armed forces in the new situation, 
further close the relationship between officers and men, and 
strengthen internal unity; how to organically integrate regular 
management work with regular ideological work, and to 
extensively conduct "four knows and one catch up," and "four 
reports and one depend" activities (four knows means the higher 
level should know at any time where the lower level is, what the 
lower level is doing, what the lower level is thinking about, 
and what the lower level needs, and the cadres should know the 
same about their men; one catch up means after knowing the four 
things mentioned above, management work and ideological work 
should catch up; one report means lower level and men should 
report, on their own accord, to the upper level and cadres where 
they are, what they are doing, what they are thinking about, and 
what they need; and one depend means whenever there are problems 
or difficulties, they should depend on the organization to solve 
problems or to overcome difficulties); how to do a good job in 
the management of offices, academies, schools, hospitals, 
warehouses, production units, and small, scattered, and remote 
units, to strengthen urban garrison work, and to make great 
efforts to eliminate weak links; how to do a good job in 
comprehensive troop management, closely integrate training, 
management, and education, arouse the strength of all quarters, 
and establish an operational mechanism for joint management; and 
how to correctly understand and handle the relationship between 
safety work and the increase of combat capacity, straighten out 
guiding ideology for safety work, and fundamentally increase the 
troops' ability to prevent accidents.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Zhang Chaojin (1728 6389 6855) and </F>
reporter Jia Yong (6328 3057)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 18 Jan (XINHUA) -- Structural changes have 
taken place among cadres of the People's Liberation Army [PLA]. 
Professional technical cadres composed mainly of scientific and 
technological personnel account for more than half of the total 
cadres, thus becoming an important force in the Army's 
modernization. 
  To educate and cultivate a large number of both 
socialist-minded and professionally proficient 
scientific-technical cadres is a strategic decision made by the 
Central Military Commission [CMC] under the new period of reform 
and opening up. The whole Army conscientiously carries out 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's belief -- that "science and technology 
are the primary productive forces" -- and makes great efforts to 
build a well-coordinated and rationally structured contingent of 
scientific-technical cadres who have high political awareness, 
are professionally competent, and possess a good work style. At 
present, tens of thousands of scientific-technical cadres hold 
high-level posts in charge of specialized technologies across 
the whole Army. A dozen of them have been elected academicians 
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and more than 5,000 cadres 
enjoy special allowances from the government. The entire Army 
attaches importance to cultivating middle-aged and young 
scientific-technical cadres. Thus far, more than 200 
middle-aged and young experts have made outstanding state-level 
contributions. Of them, the youngest professor is only 28 years 
old. In our Army, senior experts with outstanding achievements 
and middle-aged and young experts with marked contributions 
represent separately the highest or first-class level that our 
country has reached in certain scientific areas. We have taken 
the lead in the world in scoring some research results in weapon 
tests, satellite launching, engineering technology, basic 
medical science, and superlarge computer development. Hundreds 
of scientific-technical personnel in our Army have been elected 
members, directors, or executive chairmen of authoritative 
academic organizations at home and abroad. 
  Following the development of the contingent of scientists 
and 
technicians, our Army established and perfected policies and 
regulations on managing professional technical cadres to 
gradually institutionalize and regularize this contingent. The 
CMC and the PLA headquarters successively promulgated seven sets 
of regulations for managing professional cadres -- regulations 
concerning the examination and appointment of professional 
technical cadres, grade adjustments, grades for civilian 
employees, and promotions and awards for cadres who have made 
remarkable contributions. They also made stipulations 
concerning the political treatment and pay for professional 
technical cadres. All major units have also taken new measures 
to encourage scientific-technical personnel. These effective 
regulations and measures have aroused the enthusiasm of the 
broad masses of scientific-technical cadres to contribute their 
wisdom and talents to the modernization of national defense. In 
recent years, the entire Army has won nearly 10,000 state and 
military science and technology achievements awards. Many of 
these achievements have reached advanced international levels or 
have filled the gap in the fields of science and technology at 
home.

well as militia and reserve forces in Jiangsu, in keeping with 
the development of the new situation. 
  At the session, Wei Changan, secretary of the party 
committee 
and political commissar of the provincial military district, 
delivered a work report on behalf of the provincial military 
district's party committee standing committee. He said: Last 
year, the provincial military district concentrated efforts on 
building up grass-roots units and ensuring their quality, and 
fulfilled tasks in various fields, thereby maintaining the 
upward trend in the building of army units and reserve forces. 
In the coming year, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and his concept 
of army building in the new era, the provincial military 
district will further implement the policy of attaching primary 
importance to quality; go all out to expedite the construction 
of party committee leading bodies at all levels and grass-roots 
units; and strengthen the war preparedness, training, and 
management of army units and militia and reserve forces so as to 
push the building of army units and reserve forces to a new 
height. 
  (Chen Chungeng), secretary of the party committee discipline 
inspection commission and deputy political commissar of the 
provincial military district, gave an evaluation report on 
results in promoting clean administration by army units in 
Jiangsu in various phases, and set forth demands for further 
promoting clean administration by members of the party committee. 
  Chen Huanyou, secretary of the provincial party committee 
and 
first secretary of the provincial military district party 
committee, gave an important speech. He said: Last year, the 
provincial military district, while attending to work related to 
war preparedness, training, management, logistic support, and 
militia and reserve forces, actively organized army units and 
militia and reserve personnel in supporting key local 
construction projects and taking part in rescuing disaster 
victims and delivering relief, thereby forging closer ties 
between soldiers and civilians and promoting reform, opening up, 
economic construction, and social stability in Jiangsu. In the 
coming year, party committees at all levels in the provincial 
military district should diligently study Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, persist in using the theory to achieve unity in 
thinking and to guide the work, and strive to promote the 
building of army units and militia and reserve forces to a new 
height. 
  He added: The annual Spring Festival is drawing near. All 
localities should launch "double supports" activities for 
building closer army-civilian relations. The provincial 
military district, all military subdistricts and garrisons, and 
people's armed forces departments at all levels should strive to 
solidify and develop the excellent situation of army-civilian 
unity. 
  Zheng Bingqing, member of the provincial party committee 
standing committee and commander of the provincial military 
district, outlined the requirements for improving leadership and 
work style and fulfilling this year's tasks.

<F P=106> [Report by Zhang Junxiong (1728 6511 7160), Li Yunlong (2621 </F>
0061 7893), and Dou Mang (4535 5345): "Nanjing Military Region 
Logistics System Model Commendation Meeting Ends; Leaders From 
General Logistics Department and Military Region Present Prizes 
to Advanced Collectives and Individuals"] 
  [Excerpts] On 11 January, a meeting to commend models of 
the logistics system under the Nanjing Military Region came to a 
successful conclusion. A total of 182 advanced individuals and 
representatives from advanced units went up to the platform to 
receive their prizes. 
  Zhou Youliang, a leader from the General Logistics 
Department; Nanjing Military Region's leaders Gu Hui, Fang Zuqi, 
Guo Xizhang, He Qizong, Yan Zhuo, Wang Yongming, Lan Baojing, 
Chen Bingde, Wang Tongzhuo, Wang Chuanwu, and Shi Shuizhou 
attended the closing ceremony. 
  Yang Zhuo, deputy commander of the military region read out 
a 
notice of commendation for advanced units and individuals in 
logistic construction in the Nanjing Military Region. [passage 
omitted] 
  Guo Xizhang, deputy commander of the military region, spoke 
at the meeting. He said: The Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee and the CPC National Congress has further 
specified and systematized the goal of establishing a socialist 
market economic system. From now on, the pace of developing a 
market economy will be further quickened, and a number of new 
policies will gradually be introduced. The development of a 
socialist market economy has not only brought about historic 
opportunities for logistic construction, but also has made many 
new demands on logistics guarantee work. Logistics units at all 
levels should, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, 
earnestly study the impact of the market economy on logistics 
work; deepen reform; and do a good job in providing logistics 
guarantee under the conditions of a market economy. 
  He stressed: In order to meet market needs and deepen 
reform, we must properly handle the relationship between 
carrying forward tradition and blazing new trails. Over a long 
period of time, our army has built up a whole set of fine 
traditions; it is a unique and superior feature of our army. Be 
it military, political or logistics work, we should seriously 
carry forward the fine tradition. Presently, reform is the 
current of the time, but when we emphasize reform, it does not 
mean we no longer need the effective part of our glorious 
tradition. We should say that notwithstanding the fact that the 
guiding ideology, principles, and methods for our army's 
logistics guarantee were formulated under the planned economy, 
they have embodied the nature of our army's logistics work; 
possess the characteristics of a military economy; and, on the 
whole are still practicable. When we carry out partial reform, 
introduce the competition mechanism, the benefit mechanism, and 
the incentive mechanism, we should never overlook the direction 
of logistics services; and when we apply the general principles 
of the market economy to guide logistics reform, we must never 
forget the nature and special law of the military economy so as 
to ensure the healthy and steady development of logistics reform.

<F P=106> [By reporter Xu Jinzhang (5171 6855 4545)] </F>
  [Text] Urumqi, 19 Jan (XINHUA) -- In a recent interview 
with this reporter, Abulaidi Amudurexiti, acting chairman of the 
Xinjiang regional government, and Pan Zhaomin, Xinjiang Military 
District political commissar, said cheerfully that a new 
situation in army-government unity, army-people unity, and unity 
among the different nationalities has emerged in Xinjiang 
because the soldiers and people in the region have respected one 
another, supported one another, and worked side by side, with 
the building of a stable and prosperous Xinjiang as their common 
mission. 
  After recounting Xinjiang's achievements in economic 
construction in other fields of work, Abulaidi Amudurexiti said: 
The development and prosperity of Xinjiang is the product of 
unity between soldiers and civilians, and unity among various 
nationalities. The military units stationed in Xinjiang have 
regarded assisting localities in invigorating their economy as 
an important task in guaranteeing social stability and promoting 
unity among nationalities. In recent years, officers and men of 
the military units in Xinjiang have taken part in more than 210 
key construction projects in various localities, assisted 
localities in building more than 310 public facilities, taken 
part in over 1,200 disaster rescue operations, planted more than 
1 million trees on a voluntary basis, built more than 150 school 
structures, and assisted more than 80,000 poor households in 
areas where they are stationed in freeing themselves from 
poverty. The officers and men have helped people of various 
nationalities to dig more than 1,400 km of irrigation ditches, 
thus expanding the irrigated areas by 1.4 million mu. Water 
diversion canals, such as the "Canal of Army-People Unity" and 
the "Canal of Love for the People," have been built in many 
areas north and south of the Tianshan. The military units have 
also voluntarily helped the masses sink more than 110 wells and 
install over 40,000 meters of water pipes, thus solving the 
problem of water supply for more than 120,000 herdsmen's 
households and ending their long history of drinking unclean 
water obtained from snow. The people of all nationalities in 
Xinjiang will never forget the contributions of the soldiers, 
who are their sons and brothers, in developing Xinjiang. 
  Pan Zhaomin said: The people of all nationalities in 
Xinjiang regard the "Army as a great wall, and soldiers as their 
relatives." Whenever a military unit has some important arduous 
task to perform, the masses in the surrounding areas dispatch 
young and able-bodied men to assist in transporting goods and 
provisions. Despite a shortage of capital, the governments at 
various levels have done their best to raise funds to help 
military units solve problems of drinking water and electric 
power, and other problems involving employment for the 
dependents of officers and schooling for their children. 
Commercial enterprises, supply and marketing departments, and 
bookstores have frequently organized mobile service vehicles to 
deliver goods to the military barracks. Counties, cities, and 
agriculture-animal husbandry farms run by regiments have 
established a system of army-people joint defense to help 
military units conduct patrols and maintain stability along the 
border areas. Throughout the autonomous region more than 3,100 
household service centers have been set up to warmly help the 
officers and men guarding the frontier, and to solve the 
problems of dependents of servicemen and revolutionary martyrs. 
Every road, every military barrack, every electric power 
station, and every water diversion project along the border 
defense area is imbued with the painstaking labor of the people 
of all nationalities.

  [Text] Yesterday, leaders at all levels throughout the 
province, almost 10,000 taxation cadres, as well as some 
officers and men in armed forces units and police corps 
stationed in Fujian, took to the streets to propagate the new 
Tax Law. This is the most extensive tax law propagation 
activity in Fujian since the founding of the PRC. 
  Recently the State Taxation Administration decided to 
conduct 
a month-long nationwide taxation propagation activity from 23 
January to 23 February. This activity had previously been 
scheduled for April this year. They also decided that 23 
January would be the first day of enforcement for the new Tax 
Law throughout the country. 
  Giving up their holidays yesterday, all taxation cadres set 
up more than 1,000 propagation centers throughout the province 
and also went to factories, mines, and enterprises, thus 
starting the month- long province-wide taxation propagation 
activity. 
  Wang Jianshuang, a member of the provincial party 
committee's 
Standing Committee and vice governor, took part in the 
propagation activity held in the [word indistinct] center in 
Fuzhou City.

  [Text] Jinan, January 29 (XINHUA) -- East China's Shandong 
Province reported a remarkable increase in invested foreign

  An official from the provincial foreign economic and trade 
commission said the province approved some 7,229 foreign-funded 
firms last year, involving a total contractual foreign 
investment of about 7 billion U.S. dollars, exceeding the total

12.45 billion U.S. dollars, the official said. 
  He added that about 72 percent of the foreign-funded firms 
fall into the area of manufacturing and 28 percent are in such 
fields as agriculture, aquatic production, the service trade, 
energy, transportation and high technology. 
  The province has capitalized on its abundant natural 
resources and superior geographic situation and made painstaking 
efforts to improve its infrastructure over the past decade.

  [Text] Qingdao, February 1 (XINHUA) -- The special 
economic zones in east China's Shandong peninsula have boosted 
their foreign trade markedly. 
  According to statistics, these zones exported 2.47 billion 
U.S. dollars-worth of goods last year, an increase of 78.7 
percent over the previous year. 
  The zones are located in the eight cities of Qingdao, 
Yantai, 
Weihai, Weifang, Zibo, Rizhao, Jinan and Dongying. 
  A local official attributed the good result to a positive 
expansion of foreign economic cooperation. 
  In addition to increases in imports and exports, a survey 
shows that these open cities, empowered to export their products 
by themselves, have absorbed foreign funds, offered labor 
service, opened enterprises overseas and conducted international 
tourist service. 
  Aiming for the international market, the peninsula has 
combined agriculture with industry and trade to form an 
all-embracing export-oriented setup.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 28 (XINHUA) -- The opening up of 
Shanghai municipality's Pudong area has greatly promoted the 
economic development of the whole area along the Chang Jiang 
River. 
  In April, 1990, Pudong was listed by the Chinese central 
government as a development zone open to the outside world. In 
May 1992 the State Council put forward the strategy of making 
Pudong as the lead to promote economic development of the Chang 
Jiang River Valley. Since then, the provinces along the Chang 
Jiang, including Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan and 
Sichuan, have all taken the opportunity to speed up their own 
economic growth. 
  By the end of 1993, these provinces had set up more than 300 
agencies in Shanghai and nearly 2,000 enterprises from these 
provinces registered in the city have gone into operation, 
according to an official from the office of cooperation and 
coordination under the municipal government. 
  In Pudong alone, the official said, about ten buildings with 
a total investment of two billion yuan (230 million U.S. 
dollars) have been jointly built by these provinces and 
Shanghai. Besides, over 600 construction teams from these 
provinces have been working in Shanghai. 
  In 1993, 4.5 million tons of materials and commodities from 
Jiangsu Province was transferred at Shanghai. The province had 
also 760,000 tons of goods exported through Shanghai port. The 
value of materials Shanghai transferred for Hunan Province 
reached 65 million yuan. 
  Various specialized markets established in Shanghai in 
recent 
years have become springboards for the provinces along the Chang 
Jiang to enter domestic and international markets. Among the 
members of the ten big commodity exchanges in Shanghai, such as 
for metals, petroleum and building materials, who came from 
outside Shanghai, nearly half came from the six provinces along 
the Chan Jiang. 
  In addition, the stocks of 13 enterprises in the six 
provinces have been listed in the Shanghai Securities Exchange 
so far. In 1993, Shanghai's funds markets helped to provide the 
provinces with nearly 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion U.S. dollars). 
  By the end of 1993, Shanghai had invested 500 million yuan 
in 
building centers of raw materials in the provinces along the 
Chang Jiang and in supporting them to produce parts of the 
"Santana" sedan car for the car's chief plant in Shanghai. 
  Hunan Province alone has signed with Shanghai contracts on 
over 500 cooperative projects. It has made use of 34 million 
yuan of funds and over 500 technical workers from Shanghai. 
These projects have helped Hunan Province to increase output 
value by 270 million yuan and additional pre-tax profits of 30 
million yuan. 
  Huang Ju, mayor of Shanghai, said recently that Shanghai 
would further expand its economic and technical cooperation with 
the provinces along the Chang Jiang in 1994.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 31 (XINHUA) -- The Municipal 
Government of Shanghai, the largest industrial and commercial 
center in China, has approved a decision to allow foreign 
investors to engage in the development and management of 
commercial housing for domestic sales. 
  The decision applies to areas where dangerous, ramshackle 
houses and crowded old-style alleys account for more than 50 
percent of residential space. 
  Investors will enjoy preferential prices for the lease of 
land use rights and the limit for the lease of land use rights 
will be 70 years, according to the decision. 
  Under the decision, an investor may acquire land use rights 
after turning over to the government a sum of money. Investors 
will have to shoulder relocation fees and other expenses. 
  The foreign-funded commercial housing will be targeted at 
Chinese individuals, enterprises or institutions, the decision 
noted. 
  Investors will have to re-sign the contracts for the lease 
of 
land use rights if they want to sell the houses abroad, the 
decision pointed out.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 31 (XINHUA) -- The Shanghai branch 
of the People's Construction Bank of China today used export 
credits totaling 30 million U.S. dollars from four foreign banks 
to speed up the growth of the local chemical industry. 
  An official of the branch said that two loans -- 8.31 
million 
dollars and 7.94 million dollars -- will be extended by U.S. 
banks. 
  Another loan of 7.82 million deutsche marks will come from a 
German bank and still another loan of one billion Japanese yen 
from a Japanese bank. 
  The official said that part of the foreign loans will be 
used 
for the construction of the Shanghai coking and chemical plant. 
  When completed at the end of this year, the coking and 
chemical plant will be able to produce 1.7 million cubic meters 
of gas daily, enough to supply 600,000 households, he said. 
  The plant will be be built at a total cost of 1.7 billion 
yuan and 70 million U.S. dollars. 
  The official said that the rest of the foreign credits will 
be used to built an acrylic fiber plant, designed to turn out 
20,000 tons annually, in the Shanghai Jinyang Acrylic Fiber 
Factory. 
  The factory went into operation in March 1993, involving a 
total investment of 100 million U.S. dollars, he said. 
  He said that to date, his branch has extended a total of 175 
million U.S. dollars in foreign loans to the coking and chemical 
plant and the Jinyang factory.

  [Text] Hangzhou, January 28 (XINHUA) -- East China's 
Zhejiang Province is making active efforts to develop a 
diversified economy while maintaining stable grain production. 
  These efforts have already begun to pay off. Now, the crop 
planting, animal husbandry, forestry and fisheries have all 
experienced overall development. 
  At present, the output of meat, poultry and eggs is more 
than 
double the corresponding figures for the late 1970s. 
  The province has also established 40 specialized production 
centers for mushrooms and day lilies. Some 300,000 rural 
households are involved and they turn out 200,000 tons of edible 
fungus a year. 
  Besides producing the biggest quantity of good-quality tea, 
the province is also experiencing a sharp growth of honey, 
oranges, canned food, dairy products and processed aquatic 
products 
  With a coastline of more than 6,000 km, the southeast China 
province is blessed with a climate and soil ideal for 
agricultural production, but with a comparatively small per 
capita availability of farmland and the task of feeding a 
population of at least 42 million. 
  Beginning early last year, the provincial government 
initiated a coordination group for the development of non-grain 
sectors, and organized leaders of related departments and 
researchers and professors of local research institutes and 
universities to draw up the "Non-Grain Food Development Plan of 
Zhejiang Province in the 1990s". 
  According to the plan, the province will make great efforts 
to develop a wide range of non-grain foodstuffs, with the 
emphasis going to the development of high-quality aquatic 
products in many varieties. 
  Efforts will also be made to carry out an adjustment of the 
product mix of traditional non-grain foodstuffs, such as 
products related to livestock and poultry. 
  According to local officials, artificial breeding centers 
and 
specialized markets for wild fowls and animals, snakes and 
insects will be set up in a bid to enhance the output of more 
unusual foodstuffs. 
  Local officials said that the application of new techniques 
and the introduction of new varieties should be encouraged to 
increase efficiency and bring the initiatives of producers, 
traders and consumers into full play, said local officials. 
  They said that the catchwords for Zhejiang's efforts in this 
direction are "high quality", high output" and "high efficiency".

  [Text] Hangzhou, February 1 (XINHUA) -- The forestry sector 
in east China's Zhejiang Province has attracted growing 
investment from abroad. 
  By the end of last year, foreign funds used by the forestry 
sector in Zhejiang amounted to about 60 million U.S. dollars and 
there are now 45 foreign-funded enterprises in this sphere in 
the province. 
  Foreign investors turned their attention to the raising of 
fruit trees, bamboo processing and tourist projects in forest 
areas. 
  The largest foreign-funded project in Zhejiang's forestry 
sector is an afforestation project funded by the World Bank, 
whose loans to the project amounted to about 2.8 million U.S. 
dollars. 
  The first three-year phase of the project has been carried 
out and Zhejiang has planted trees on an area of 46,200 hectares. 
  The second phase of the project will start in 1995. 
  The foreign funds have promoted the export of forest 
products 
in Zhejiang. Last year, the export value of forest products in 
Zhejiang was 250 million U.S. dollars.

  [Text] Yinchuan, January 28 (XINHUA) -- China's poorest 
area, Xihaigu Prefecture in northwest China's Ningxia Hui 
Autonomous Region, has stepped up efforts to develop the local 
economy and end poverty. 
  It has given priority to explore local natural resources, 
helping local people develop agriculture and forestry. 
  The regional government has taken measures to support 
development of Xihaigu instead of purely relying on government 
relief, according to Guo Zhanyuan, head of the regional 
Agricultural Development Committee. 
  Last year, the region used a quarter of its aid-the-poor 
funds to create a number of production centers for grain, edible 
oil, animal husbandry, fruit, medicinal herbs and minerals, Guo 
said. 
  A total of 8.7 million yuan (1 million U.S. dollars) was 
used 
last year. 
  Yanchi County, near a desert, has concentrated on developing 
animal husbandry and planting medicinal herbs. Last year, the 
total number of sheep raised in the county reached over 700,000. 
A licorice root production center has been created. 
  Thanks to the efforts, the county is among the first eight 
counties in the prefecture to end poverty. 
  Xiji County has given priority to potato and pea planting to 
make dry noodles made from bean or potato starch. Its products 
are exported to ten Chinese provinces and regions, as well as 
Russia and Hong Kong. 
  Last year, the eight counties' per capita income was about 
370 yuan and grain 275 kilograms. China's poverty line is set 
at an income below 200 yuan a year.

  [Excerpts] A provincial meeting on rural and pastoral area 
work ended in Xining on the afternoon of 24 January after a 
four-day session. At the meeting provincial party Secretary Yin 
Kesheng made an important speech on agriculture, rural and 
pastoral area economic development, and on deepening reform in 
rural and pastoral areas. Leading comrades from prefectures, 
cities, and counties throughout the province seriously discussed 
Comrade Yin Kesheng's speech and the provincial authorities' 
proposals on implementing the party Central Committee's and the 
State Council's policies concerning agricultural and rural 
economic development. Governor Tian Chengping summed up the 
meeting. Provincial party and government leaders Yin Keshing, 
Wang Hanmin, and Yao Xiangcheng attended the meeting on 24 
January. Vice Governor Ma Yuanbiao chaired the meeting. 
  After reviewing the province's achievements in agriculture 
and animal husbandry and analyzing existing problems, Governor 
Tian Chengping pointed out: More than 70 percent of the 
province's population is in rural and pastoral areas, this is 
Qinghai's basic situation. Strengthening the basic position of 
agriculture and animal husbandry and bringing about overall 
economic development in rural and pastoral areas will help 
resolve the masses' inadequate food and clothing and enable them 
to move toward moderate prosperity. This also serves as a basis 
for social stability. [passage omitted] 
  Governor Tian Chengping pointed out: In the course of 
developing the socialist market economy, we should help the 
peasants and herdsmen with their production and operations 
according to market demands. This is our basic task at present. 
All levels of party committees and governments should help 
optimize the distribution of resources, adjust the production 
structure, develop rural and pastoral area economies, and 
increase the peasants and herdmen's incomes. They should take 
this as the departure point in their work. 
  Energetically developing township and town enterprises is a 
strategic point in invigorating rural and pastoral area 
economies. In development of township and town enterprises, 
attention should be paid to two points: The first is increasing 
the aggregate amount, and the second is improving economic 
returns. In market competition, agriculture and animal 
husbandry are very weak in withstanding the pressure of 
competition. Therefore all levels of governments and 
departments should work out measures to protect them, formulate 
rational grain price protection policies, form a grain reserve 
system and a grain risk-bearing fund, and control and regulate 
markets by economic means. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Xining, January 29 (XINHUA) -- With aid from the 
"Hope Project", some 12,350 children who dropped out of school 
in northwest China's Qinghai Province have returned to the 
classroom over the past three years. 
  The project was sponsored in 1989 by the Chinese Communist 
Youth League, in a bid to help children nationwide who have 
dropped out of school for various reasons to resume their 
studies. 
  In the past three years, the province's Hope Project 
Foundation has received some one million yuan in donations from 
about 260,000 home and overseas donors. 
  With these funds, the province has also established seven 
new 
"Hope primary schools" in its poverty-stricken areas. 
  Meanwhile, schools in such areas have received more than 
300,000 yuan worth of teaching aids as well as articles for 
daily use. 
  Located in the remote northeastern part of the Qinghai-Tibet 
plateau, the province is one of the most underdeveloped 
provinces in China.

  [Text] Urumqi, January 31 (XINHUA) -- Xinjiang Uygur 
Autonomous Region in northwest China is using World Bank loans 
to speed up its development. 
  By the end of 1993, the region was making use of about 300 
million U.S. dollars-worth of World Bank loans for seven 
projects, involving the sectors of education, agriculture, 
communications and public health. 
  Xinjiang started using loans from the World Bank in 1985. By 
1989, most of the projects aided by the World Bank were in the 
education sector, such as Xinjiang's Agricultural School, 
Training Center for Middle and Primary School Teachers, TV 
University of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and some local 
universities. 
  After these projects, Xinjiang began to use World Bank loans 
for economic construction including an agricultural project in 
the Tarim Basin and a water supply project and an environment 
improvement project in rural areas. 
  The water supply project benefited ten counties while the 
the 
agricultural project in the Tarim Basin reclaimed 80,000 
hectares of wasteland and transformed 12,000 hectares of 
low-yield fields. 
  About 400,000 farmers and herdsmen benefited from the World 
Bank projects. 
  Recently, the World Bank has been planning to help 
infrastructure construction in Xinjiang more. 
  The newly-planned projects include two highways, basic 
education in poorer areas, and urban construction and 
environment project in Urumqi, the region's capital. 
  It is expected that the bank loans for these projects will 
be 
440 million U.S. dollars.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Chuanxi (1728 0278 3556)] </F>
  [Text] Guangzhou, 18 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--A 
resolution adopted by the Guangdong Provincial People's Congress 
Standing Committee today said the province still has not gone 
far enough in the anticorruption operation and various 
localities need to further step up their efforts to fight 
corruption. 
  The "Resolution on Carrying on the Struggle Against 
Corruption Further in Depth Across the Province" adopted at a 
meeting of the Eighth Guangdong Provincial People's Congress 
Standing Committee this morning pointed out bluntly the 
seriousness of some corrupt social phenomena. The resolution 
said: "Some corrupt phenomena in state organs have aroused 
strong grievances among the public. If these corrupt phenomena 
are allowed to spread unchecked, they will one day ruin our 
people's regime." 
  It is disclosed that recently some 23,000 cadres at and 
above 
the county and office level in Guangdong underwent a 
self-examination process, and some 16 percent of these cadres 
admitted that their behavior in certain aspects did not fully 
meet the standards as prescribed by the "five rules" set by the 
central authorities on honesty and self-discipline. 
  This resolution by the provincial people's congress demands 
that people's congresses at all levels in Guangdong Province 
take the struggle against corruption as an important part of 
their supervisory duty and strengthen supervision over the 
operation of the government, the people's courts, and the 
people's procuratorates, as well as grass-roots organizations in 
townships and towns. 
  The ongoing meeting of the Standing Committee of the Eighth 
Guangdong Provincial People's Congress has heard reports by 
departments concerned on recent progress in the anticorruption 
operation. Some ugly social phenomena and some issues of 
corruption among some government staff have drawn great 
attention from members of the people's congress standing 
committee. 
  Standing committee member Rao Fanzi held that the main 
reason 
for worsening corruption is not the lack of applicable laws, but 
the failure to observe laws. A small number of individuals just 
fail to rule according to law, and some of those who enforce the 
law violate the law themselves or engage in illegal activities. 
  Standing committee member Liu Wenqiao noted that practicing 
extravagance in ceremonies and festivities, vacationing at 
public expense, and rush purchasing of luxury cars are very 
common and have become serious problems in Guangdong nowadays. 
These practices should be checked and redressed.

  Regional people's government Chairman Cheng Kejie delivered 
a 
government work report on behalf of the regional people's 
government at the plenary session. 
  Chairman Cheng Kejie's work report was divided into two 
parts, namely, "The 1993 Work Review" and "The 1994 Work Tasks." 
  In reviewing the 1993 work, Cheng Kejie pointed out: In 
1993, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics as well as the 
spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress, people of all 
nationalities in Guangxi closely adhered to the party's basic 
line, further emancipated the mind, strengthened confidence, and 
seized each and every opportunity to quickened the pace of 
reform, opening up, and economic construction with the result 
that we witnessed a regionwide economic boom, maintained 
political stability, strengthened nationality solidarity, and 
successfully promoted social progress. Guangxi's total 
estimated gross national product for the year 1993 reached 77.3 
billion yuan, up 18.7 percent over the previous year. 
  Cheng Kejie stated: Last year, under the leadership of the 
regional CPC committee, we firmly adhered to economic 
construction as the center and made every possible endeavor to 
improve all types of work. First, we unfolded large-scale 
discussions on building a socialist market economy, further 
emancipated the mind, and successfully transformed ideological 
concepts. Second, we quickened the pace of reform and made 
substantial progress in many key fields. Third, we strengthened 
agriculture as the foundation and comprehensively pressed ahead 
with comprehensive rural economic growth with the result that 
the region's total estimated agricultural output value for the 
year 1993 reached 38.4 billion yuan, up 5.2 percent over the 
previous year, and total estimated township and town enterprises 
output value 60.1 billion yuan, up 1.15 percent over the 
previous year. Fourth, we vigorously readjusted product mix in 
light of market needs and brought about a high-rate industrial 
growth with the result that the region's total estimated 
industrial output value at and above township level for the year 
1993 reached 69.6 billion yuan, up 22.6 percent over the 
previous year. Fifth, we further expanded opening up to the 
outside world and developed foreign economic and trade relations 
by a large margin with the result that the region's foreign 
trade witnessed a sustained growth with the total estimated 
import and export volume standing at $1.9 billion, up 15.9 
percent over the previous year. Sixth, we made more fruitful 
investment in both infrastructure facilities and basic 
industries with the result that the region's total estimated 
social investment in fixed assets reached 23 billion yuan. 
Seventh, we stepped up and improved macroeconomic regulation 
and control with the result that the regional financial order 
was improved and revenue increased. Eighth, we energetically 
developed science, technology, and education and scored 
gratifying results in developing various undertakings. Ninth, 
we enlivened both urban and rural markets and improved people's 
livelihood. Tenth, we firmly and simultaneously grasped two key 
aspects of work with the result that we succeeded in 
consolidating and developing a regionwide political situation of 
stability and unity. 
  Speaking of the 1994 work tasks, Cheng Kejie stated in his 
government work report: In 1994 we should follow such a 
principle in all endeavors as comprehensively implementing the 
spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress as well as the spirit 
of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. 
We should quicken the pace of reforms aimed at building a 
socialist market economic structure, further expand opening up 
to the outside world, strengthen and improve macroeconomic 
regulation and control, vigorously readjust the economic 
structure, maintain a sound regionwide development momentum, 
energetically push the region's economic growth onto a new stage 
on the basis of a sustained and rapid economic growth scored 
over the past few years, create conditions for quadrupling the 
region's total gross national product three years ahead of 
schedule or even sooner, and constantly promote socialist 
democracy and spiritual civilization building. 
  Speaking of the 1994 work arrangements, Cheng Kejie spelled 
out the following three requirements: 
  1. To maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy regional 
national economic growth. To this end, Cheng Kejie added, it 
has been tentatively decided that the region's total gross 
national product shall be raised by 12 percent, total 
agricultural output value by 7 percent, total industrial output 
value at and above township level by 15 percent, and total grain 
output by 1 percent on the basis of last year's figures. 
Moreover, efforts shall be made to secure a continued 
development for all trades and professions in the region. To 
attain these goals, Cheng Kejie noted, it is necessary to firmly 
grasp the following 10 aspects of work: 1) To vigorously 
develop the rural economy and increase peasants' income; 2) To 
improve industrial and communications productions in a 
down-to-earth manner with a view to increasing economic 
efficiency; 3) To successfully build key projects and 
continually accelerate ports construction; 4) To seize each and 
every opportunity to develop an export- oriented economy; 5) To 
make redoubled efforts to build a market system and invigorate 
circulation; 6) To successfully build all help-the-poor 
projects and help various poverty-stricken areas eradicate 
poverty and achieve prosperity at a faster pace; 7) To increase 
revenue, cut down on expenditure, and improve financial as well 
as credit and loan work; 8) To curb excessive price hikes and 
improve people's livelihood; 9) To continually attach strategic 
priority to educational, scientific, and technological 
development with an eye on achieving economic rejuvenation and 
prosperity; 10) To strengthen and improve family planning work 
in a down-to-earth manner and step up both land management and 
environmental protection. 
  2. To quicken the pace of reforms aimed at building a 
socialist market economic structure. This year's reforms should 
be centered on the following six aspects: 1) To deepen the 
rural economic structural reform so as to infuse rural economic 
development with fresh vigor; 2) To shift the state-owned 
enterprises operative mechanism in a down-to-earth manner and 
create conditions for establishing a modern enterprise system; 
3) To conscientiously organize activities of studying the state 
policies on financial, revenue, banking, foreign trade, and 
planning systems reforms; 4) To expedite circulation structural 
reform and vigorously build and develop an essential production 
means market; 5) To perfect a social security system and 
accelerate urban housing system reform; 6) To vigorously and 
steadily further institutional reform and practically transform 
government functions. 
  3. To press ahead with socialist democracy and spiritual 
civilization building. 
  To conclude, Cheng Kejie called on people of all 
nationalities in the region to adhere to the party's basic line 
and seize each and every excellent opportunity to speed up 
development under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee 
with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core and to strive to score new 
achievements and win new victories in 1994. 
  Those attending the plenary session as nonvoting delegates 
were the regional CPPCC committee members currently attending 
the second plenary session of the seventh regional CPPCC 
committee, some regionally elected National People's Congress 
deputies, persons in charge of the regional party committee and 
people's government departments, commissions, offices, and 
bureaus, and persons in charge of the Nanning-based higher 
learning institutions.

  [Excerpts] Last year Guangxi registered substantial 
progress in many important fields. Chairman Cheng Kejie said in 
his Government Work Report: In 1993 Guangxi stepped up its 
reform and made substantial progress in many important fields. 
In rural reform, Guangxi stabilized and improved the contract 
responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration 
linked to output and the two-tier operational system; developed 
the rural socialized service system; gradually expanded the 
force of the collective economy; implemented the Central 
Committee's instructions on reducing the peasants' burden; 
abolished 60 categories of irrational charges; reduced the 
peasants' burden by 890 million yuan; and expanded the 
trial-implementation of county-level reform, causing the number 
of experimental counties to increase from 13 to 22. 
  In enterprise reform, in accordance with the State Council's 
regulations on the transformation of the operational mechanism 
of industrial enterprises under ownership by the whole people, 
Guangxi formulated implementation methods and sorted out and 
abolished a number of documents running counter to these 
regulations. Most enterprises reformed the labor employment 
system, the personnel system, and the wage distribution system. 
More than 2,000 state- owned enterprises in Guangxi, with 1.13 
million employees, adopted all kinds of methods to link supply 
to marketing, and some enterprises abolished the eight-grade 
wage system, which had been in force for many years. All 
localities straightened out ownership and management rights, 
reformed the ownership and management system, and further 
practiced the shareholding system. There were 160 shareholding 
companies and 46 enterprise groups in Guangxi. Major efforts 
were made to develop township and town collective economic 
sectors. The output value of collective industrial economy 
increased by 49.5 percent over the previous year. Individual 
industrial and commercial households increased to 698,500 up by 
10.1 percent over the previous year; and private enterprises 
increased to 3,631, up by 73.2 percent. 
  In price system reform, state-fixed prices now account for 
only 1.5 percent of the total agricultural products under state 
procurement, 5.4 percent of the total retail sales volume of 
social commodities and 7.4 percent of the total sales of 
industrial capital goods. A mechanism is gradually taking shape 
in which the market determines prices. The circulation field 
has been further invigorated. [passage omitted] 
  The reform of the city and town housing system is proceeding 
in an all-round way and 52 cities and counties are putting into 
effect their housing system reform programs. Total housing rent 
of 1.2 billion yuan has been collected. Social insurance system 
reform, with old age pension, job awaiting, and medical care as 
the main components, is being further carried out.

  [Text] A provincial labor work conference wound up in 
Wuhan yesterday. 
  The conference pointed out that in 1994, Hubei's labor work 
should proceed by focusing on key aspects, overcoming 
difficulties, fostering and developing a labor market, and 
gradually establishing a new labor system which conforms with a 
socialist market economic structure. 
  The conference also emphatically called for rapidly building 
employment consultation institutions; strengthening management 
of nongovernmental employment consultation institutions; further 
expanding labor cooperation with other provinces and 
municipalities, especially coastal and economically developed 
regions; vigorously implementing an all-personnel labor contract 
system; and improving professional and occupational 
qualifications assessment work. To this end, the conference 
stated, it is imperative to establish a batch of authoritative 
professional and occupational qualifications assessment 
institutions at both provincial and prefectural levels within 
the year; actively develop social security undertakings as well 
as relevant economic organizations in both cities and towns 
across the province to establish a uniform, societywide, and 
omnidirectional social security system tailored to the needs of 
old-aged people. In order to properly coordinate labor 
relations, it is also imperative to carry out large-scale 
propaganda on good labor relations with a view to tackling some 
long-standing problems, such as unauthorized labor employment, 
willful lengthening of working hours, willful deduction of labor 
wages, noncompliance with labor safety standards, refusal to pay 
social security premium, illegal labor trade, and so on. It is 
also imperative to strictly regulate and control aggregate labor 
wage volume. At present, it is imperative to comprehensively 
implement and perfect a planned dynamic wage system in light of 
actual tax burdens. 
  The conference also urged stringent labor safety supervision 
and reduction of all types of labor accidents. 
  Li Daqiang, provincial party committee standing committee 
member and provincial vice governor, delivered a speech at the 
end of the conference.

  [Text] Wuhan, January 28 (XINHUA) -- More and more farmers 
in Hubei Province have become prosperous following a quick 
expansion of free markets in rural areas of this central China 
province. 
  According to local officials, there are now more than 4,200 
farmers' markets in rural Hubei. It is estimated that about 10 
billion yuan of commodities are traded there in a year. 
  The market network in rural areas of the province is formed 
with farmers' markets as the basis, and with specialized and 
wholesale markets of various kinds as the backbone. Markets of 
essential production factors have also begun to emerge. 
  In Jingzhou Prefecture, dubbed a "grain and cotton 
storehouse," farmers used to have great difficulty in selling 
their farm products. 
  But now, to the relief of local farmers, various kinds of 
grain wholesale markets, involving 20,000 individual traders, 
are doing brisk businesses of farm products through major grain 
and edible oil wholesale markets in the seats of 11 counties and 
cities, and 41 wholesale offices across 28 provinces, with one 
billion kg of grain, edible oil and related products being 
marketed a year. 
  Many farmers have become prosperous through farmers' 
markets. 
For instance, the beancurd market at Shipai township, Zhongxiang 
city has got famous. The existence of the market not only 
enriches the vegetable baskets of local residents, but also 
helps to increase the income of nearby farmers. 
  Now 50 percent of farmers from rural areas not far from the 
beancurd market are engaged in production and marketing of bean 
products. Their annual per capita income has reached 1,000 yuan. 
  The quick development of various specialized markets and 
wholesale markets has played a positive role in the overall 
economic development of different localities, said the officials. 
  The provincial government has been working out more rules 
and 
regulations to guide markets of various kinds in the province to 
develop healthily.

  [Excerpts] Yesterday morning, the provincial party 
committee and government jointly held a broadcast teleconference 
at which they discussed major problems of Hubei's publications 
market and planned a province-wide crackdown on pornography and 
hooliganism during the Lunar New Year Festival period. 
  The provincial party committee and government decided to 
unfold a two-month crackdown on pornography and hooliganism 
across the province during the Lunar New Year Festival period 
with a view to resolving problems on Hubei's publications 
market. [passage omitted] 
  Provincial Vice Governor Han Nanpeng briefed the conference 
participants on major problems in Hubei's publications market 
and made arrangements for the upcoming province-wide crackdown. 
  Wang Zhongnong, provincial party committee standing 
committee 
member and propaganda department director, laid down 
requirements for the upcoming provincewide crackdown, saying: 
Under the new situation, we should heighten understanding of 
the importance, urgency, and complexity of the struggle against 
pornography and hooliganism. Under no circumstances should we 
try to seek economic growth at the expense of cultural growth. 
We should properly handle relations between the central task of 
economic construction and the struggle against pornography and 
hooliganism, between building a socialist market economy and 
opposing pornography and hooliganism, as well as between 
building two civilizations and opposing pornography and 
hooliganism. We should view the publications market from a 
high, political, and strategic plane, and strive to push ahead 
with the struggle against pornography and hooliganism with 
perfect assurance. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In the provincial party school's auditorium 
yesterday morning, provincial party Secretary Wang Maolin made a 
guidance report on Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping to more than 600 cadets of the first stage of the 
provincial theoretical study class for prefectural- and 
departmental-level cadres, the training course for young and 
middle-aged cadres, the research class for party and government 
cadres, the special course for ethnic cadres, the cadres school, 
and the provincial Communist Youth League School. 
  In his report, Comrade Wang Maolin stressed the importance 
of 
studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, and the need to integrate theory with practice 
and strengthen leadership over theoretical study. 
  He said: Only by intensively studying Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, can we understand 
what socialism is and how to build socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, lay a solid ideological foundation for the 
establishment of a new socialist market economic structure and 
improve leaders' leadership mentality, their leadership level, 
and their ability to control the overall situation. 
  Comrade Wang Maolin pointed out: All-level party committees 
should put the study of Marxist theory in an important position 
and leading cadres at all levels should take the lead in 
studying theory. In the meantime, in theoretical study, there 
is a need to abide by the principle of being new and applicable 
and to further improve and observe all rules on theoretical 
study. In particular, theoretical propagation workers should 
conduct in-depth and painstaking research, write significant 
articles, and enthusiastically provide guidance lectures to 
deepen theoretical study. 
  Yang Zhengwu, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee; and Luo Haifan, member of the provincial party 
committee's Standing Committee and chief of the Organization 
Department, attended the meeting. Ying Sheng, president of the 
provincial party school, presided over the meeting.

  [Text] Yesterday Hu Kehui, chief procurator of the Guizhou 
Provincial People's Procuratorate, made a report to the 
provincial People's Congress session on the province's 
procuratorial work. One year ago, He Kehui, member of the 
provincial party committee's Standing Committee, was elected 
chief procurator by provincial People's Congress deputies. 
After assuming office, she undertook the heavy task of severely 
punishing economic crimes and criminal offenses. 
  Procuratorates throughout the province are facing this 
situation: On the one hand, there are difficulties in economic 
development, reform achievements have not been easy, and 10 
million people are still in poverty. On the other hand, a small 
number of people are abusing their power for personal gain, 
trading power away for personal benefit, and lining their 
pockets at others' expense. What a sharp contrast! So her 
responsibility is even heavier. 
  Last year, together with other comrades of the 
procuratorates, she handled 952 major cases each involving more 
than 10,000 yuan, dealt with 18 major criminal cases involving 
cadres at the county sectional level and above. The arrests of 
Yan Jianhong, former board chairman of the provincial 
international trust and investment corporation; Guo Zhengmin, 
former chief of the provincial public security department; and 
Ma Yongqing, former general manager of the Guizhou Airline 
Company afforded general satisfaction. 
  Procuratorates throughout the province has made breakthrough 
progress in dealing with economic crime, recovering an economic 
loss of 58.95 million yuan for the state and collectives. In 
the meantime, procuratorates throughout the province have meted 
out punishments to major criminal offenders, thus protecting 
reform, opening up, and the masses. 
  On the work in 1994, He Kehui said: This year is a year of 
conscientiously implementing instructions of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and of developing the 
socialist market economy, during which reform will enter a 
crucial period. It is also a year in which the fight against 
corruption will develop in depth. Procuratorates throughout the 
province should profoundly conduct the struggle against 
corruption. Above all, they should concentrate on examining and 
handling major and important cases, uphold the principle of 
severe crackdown, safeguard the country's political stability 
and social tranquility, strengthen their supervision over law 
enforcement, and continue to change the situation where law is 
not observed or law enforcement is not strict. The people trust 
the people's procurators. 
  In the auditorium of the provincial people's government 
yesterday afternoon, Xie Jinhan, who has worked for decades on 
the judicial front, came up to the rostrum of the provincial 
People's Congress meeting to report on the work of the Guizhou 
Provincial Higher People's Court. Last year courts throughout 
the province conscientiously implemented the party Central 
Committee's instructions on preserving social stability, further 
strengthened their function in exercising dictatorship over 
enemies, and resolutely dealt with all kinds of criminals 
according to the law, thus puncturing the their arrogance and 
providing a powerful guarantee for the province's stability. 
  In addition, courts throughout the province followed the 
party Central Committee's arrangements in carrying out combat 
against corruption. Focusing on major and important cases, they 
increased the momentum of strikes at economic crimes. Last 
year, they handled 1,755 economic cases. Through trial, they 
recovered an economic loss of 1.18 million yuan for the state 
and collectives. 
  In the course of curbing economic crimes, courts throughout 
the province focused their blows on government functionaries, 
particularly leading cadres, who abused their power for 
corruption, bribery, and embezzlement of public money. Last 
year, they handled 515 corruption, bribery, and public money 
embezzlement cases and punished 636 criminals. Following the 
deepening of the fight against corruption, more economic 
criminal cases were unearthed and dealt with one after another. 
More economic criminal cases will be submitted to courts. 
  For this reason, Xie Jinhan pointed out in his report: 
Courts throughout the province should make the necessary 
preparations both mentally and in terms of having adequate court 
personnel. Major corruption and bribery cases must be 
thoroughly examined and severely punished, no matter who is 
involved. 
  On the work in 1994, Xie Jinhan said: The general 
requirement for this year is to produce good results in 
crackdowns on major and important cases and to make big headway 
in adjusting economic relations. For the interests of the 
country and the people, for the dignity of law, courts 
throughout the province must, under the supervision of party 
committees, leaders, and people's congresses at all levels, make 
important contributions to the fight against corruption.

  [Text] Since the start of the anticorruption struggle in 
the region, party committees and governments at various levels 
have attached importance to checking the indiscriminate 
collection of fees, which has provoked strong reactions among 
the masses, and to reducing the burdens of peasants and 
herdsmen. They have taken a firm and clear stand and acted 
promptly to deal with such problems with good initial results. 
  Through the investigation of indiscriminate fee collecting 
and other problems, it was learned that there are 177 kinds of 
fee at the regional level and 1,337 rules governing their 
collection. Various units have discovered a number of cases of 
indiscriminate collection of fees, fines, retention of fees, and 
misappropriation of public funds involving a total of 1.761 
million yuan. All of this has now been delivered to the state 
treasury. 
  As of end of 1993, the autonomous region announced the 
cancellation of 20 kinds of unreasonable fee, and various 
prefectures and cities announced the cancellation of 216 kinds 
of unreasonable fees. Most departments and units in the 
autonomous region also checked on the matter in a serious manner. 
  The Regional Education Commission checked on 13 kinds of 
fees 
and has now canceled six kinds of unreasonable fee. The 
Regional Foreign Affairs Office has stopped seven kinds of fee 
which were collected in addition to the standard fee for issuing 
passports to people wanting to go abroad. The Regional 
Agricultural Commission checked on 13 kinds of fee which add a 
burden to peasants and herdsmen. The Lhasa City Public Security 
Bureau checked on 118 kinds of fee and canceled seven and 
temporarily stopped 25 others with the approval of the Lhasa 
City party committee and the city government. The city public 
security bureau also checked on fines, household fees and car 
deregistration fees. It discovered 300,000 yuan in fees which 
should not be collected. This has now been handed to the city 
financial authority. Meanwhile, some units have corrected the 
situation in which supporting fees [zan zhu fei] were collected 
from enterprises and institutions by staff members and workers 
of those units.

  [Text] Lang Dazhong, provincial party committee standing 
committee member and provincial discipline inspection commission 
secretary, made an anticorruption work report at a situation 
briefing held by the provincial party committee united front 
work department yesterday. 
  The briefing was attended by the Kunming-based National 
People's Congress deputies, Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National Committee members, 
persons in charge of the provincial branches of various 
democratic parties and people's organizations, well-known public 
figures without party affiliation, as well as prominent ethnic 
minority and religious personages. 
  Lang Dazhong said in his report: Since the Second Plenary 
Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Committee concluded 
last August, the provincial party committee and government have 
attached great importance to the deep anticorruption struggle, 
conscientiously carried out mobilization work and made 
arrangements in this regard, and employed practical and feasible 
measures. The discipline inspection, supervision, 
procuratorial, judicial, and other functional departments across 
the province have also done a lot of work to this end. The 
broad masses of the people have reported and provided clues on a 
large number of corruption cases with the result that a batch of 
major and serious corruption cases have been cracked and 
handled, a batch of corrupt elements penalized, a batch of 
malpractices resented by the masses wiped out, and a batch of 
unreasonable charges abolished. The malpractice of going on 
domestic and overseas sightseeing tours at public expense in 
disguised form has been put to an end. With a serious and 
conscientious attitude, leading cadres at and above city level 
across the province have also held internal democratic meetings; 
placed themselves under the supervision of the masses; and 
conducted self-examination and self-rectification in accordance 
with the five central regulations on building a clean government 
and maintaining self-discipline among cadres with the result 
that a batch of problems have been resolved. These activities 
have dealt a telling blow at all types of negative and corrupt 
phenomena. At the moment, the provincewide anticorruption 
struggle is still going on in an in-depth manner in accordance 
with the central arrangements. 
  Lang Dazhong stated: The whole province should make 
continued efforts to fulfill three major tasks during the next 
stage of the anticorruption struggle and heighten understanding 
of the anticorruption struggle; consciously adhere to the 
principle of firmly and simultaneously grasping two key work 
aspects; concentrate on attaining three goals; see to it that 
leading cadres remain honest and maintain self-discipline; and 
waste no time in investigating and handling corruption cases and 
rectifying malpractices. At the moment, we should also make 
every possible endeavor to prevent such malpractices as holding 
banquets and giving gifts at public expense, engaging in 
extravagance and waste, and so on, from recurring during the 
Lunar New Year Festival. 
  The meeting was also attended by Ling Huan, provincial party 
committee deputy secretary; Yang Ming and Mai Xiqiu, provincial 
people's congress standing committee vice chairmen; Dao Shixun, 
Xiang Chaozong, and Liu Bangrui, provincial CPPCC committee vice 
chairmen; as well as persons in charge of the relevant 
departments.

  [Text] On January 25th, in order to safeguard the public 
security of the national capital, put a stern damper on the 
arrogance of serious criminal elements, and protect the people's 
legal rights and interests, the municipal intermediate people's 
court strictly punished a number of criminals who had seriously 
undermined public security. Six criminals guilty of the most 
heinous crimes were escorted to the execution ground and 
executed by shooting. They were Qin Youli, a jobless person of 
the municipality, for rape and hooliganism; Sun Qinglai, a 
person released from reeducation through labor, for arson; Han 
Taiping, a peasant from Henan Province, for theft and escape; 
Zhang Wenzheng and Gao Yunsheng, jobless persons of the 
municipality, for murder with intent; and Nie Yongqing, a 
peasant from Yanqing County of the municipality, for intentional 
violence. Yang Yinlong, Jin Huang, Wang Guoen, Liu Qingrui, Li 
Jingbin, Lu Xuejun, He Yibin, Zhang Guangli, Zhang Yong, Liang 
Cuifa, Song Qingguo, and Ji Tiejun who were guilty of robbery, 
intentional injury, habitual theft, intentional murder, and 
swindling were sentenced to death and deprived of their 
political rights for life at the first trial, and their 
confederates were also sternly punished. 
  Most of the criminal elements who were punished by the 
municipal intermediate people's court on 25 January had been 
punished by public security and judicial organs before for 
breaking laws, but they refused to repent and continued their 
group or individual criminal activities. They humiliated and 
raped young girls in public; committed arson to burn many people 
and property; colluded with each other to rob with weapons, 
injured people, and swindled money; fled to Beijing from other 
localities to commit robbery and theft of public and private 
money and property; committed murder for failing to win love; 
killed and injured people without reason; robbed and killed a 
taxi driver; and killed personnel on duty while robbing a 
savings bank. They are the most evil criminal elements. Their 
crimes were extremely vicious, caused great danger to society, 
and incurred the greatest popular indignation. 
  Qin Youli, who was executed on 25 January, resorted to 
violence on numerous occasions in raping two hired women workers 
in his home during March and April 1993. He also raped, 
humiliated, and acted indecently toward women workers in public 
at a working room in the restaurant he ran. Three people were 
victimized. 
  Zhang Wenzheng, a jobless person of the municipality who had 
been sentenced before, harboring hatred towards his girlfriend 
Liu who left him, premeditated retaliation through violence. 
Using a sharp knife and other weapons on 13 January 1993, he 
forced Liu who was on her way home from work, to go with him to 
a certain plant in Shijingshan District. He killed Liu by 
stabbing her several times on her neck and chest. 
  Yang Yinlong, Jin Huang, Wang Guoen, Liu Qingrui, and Li 
Jingbin, who were sentenced to death at the first trial by the 
municipal intermediate people's court on 25 January, formed a 
criminal ring with two other jobless persons of the 
municipality. From October 1991 to May 1992, they used 
repeating firelocks and knives to rob houses or waylay people in 
the Jiuxianqiao, Jiangtaixiang, Yonganli, and Tuanjiehu areas of 
Chaoyang District. Many people were victimized. They stole 
over 40,000 yuan renminbi, $1,500, a Bluebird car, and large 
amounts of materials, such as cameras, videos, watches, and gold 
ornaments, worth over 280,000 yuan. 
  Ji Shuhan, president of the municipal intermediate people's 
court, said: The municipal intermediate people's court will 
fully apply laws as a weapon to sternly punish criminals who 
have seriously endangered the national capital's public security 
by their crimes of murder, robbery, rape, and habitual theft. 
In particular, it will resolutely and strictly crack down on 
the criminals who have committed vicious crimes, the criminals 
who refuse to mend their ways despite repeated admonition, and 
the serious criminals who have fled to Beijing from other 
localities to commit crimes; and will never be soft-hearted 
toward them so as to safeguard the social stability of the 
national capital and create a good social environment to 
accelerate reform, opening up, and the modernization.

  [Text] On 29 January, Cheng Weigao, secretary of the 
provincial party committee, heard reports made by the provincial 
discipline inspection commission and the provincial departments 
concerned on how to spend a frugal Spring Festival and 
consolidate achievements in the struggle against corruption. 
  After hearing the reports, Cheng Weigao again urged that the 
party and government organs at various levels and their leading 
cadres should be honest and thrifty in their spending during the 
Spring Festival and that the discipline inspection and 
supervisory organs at various levels should strengthen 
supervision and inspections. 
  Cheng Weigao stressed: The year 1994 is a year for package 
reform and breakthroughs in key areas. So long as the leading 
cadres at various levels maintain honesty and establish close 
contacts with the masses, the reform measures will be supported 
by the masses and reform progress smoothly. Party committees 
and governments at various levels should always regard the 
opposition to corruption and the maintenance of honesty as a 
political task and grasp it. At present, we should grasp the 
issue of honesty during the Spring Festival. Leading cadres at 
various levels should take the lead in being honest. As for 
localities, departments, and units where many serious problems 
emerge, their principal leading cadres should first be called to 
account.

  [Text] Stability is a most important task was the main 
topic of the speech made by Cheng Weigao, secretary of the 
provincial party committee, at the provincial judicial, 
procuratorial, and court work conference that ended on 31 
January. 
  In his speech, Cheng Weigao set forth: The current economic 
and political situation of Hebei Province is comparatively good. 
However, this does not mean that there aren't any problems or 
difficulties. We know that many unstable factors and prominent 
security problems persist regarding political and social 
stability. Thus, we must strengthen our sense of adversity in 
this state of contentment. That is, we should ensure that we 
keep an eye out for danger when we are content, subjugation when 
we have stability, and disorder when we have good order. He 
stressed: 
  [Begin Cheng Weigao recording] Reform is the motivation, 
development is the purpose, and stability is the guarantee. 
Without the deepening of reform, there will be no foundation 
for development and stability in the situation and it will be 
impossible for social stability to last for very long. However, 
without a stable social environment, there will be no success in 
reform, it will be impossible to make development, and nothing 
will be accomplished. [end recording] 
  Cheng Weigao urged: Party committees at various levels 
should go all out to grasp the work of safeguarding stability 
just as they do to grasp economic construction. We should 
strengthen the forecast before the issuance of reform measures; 
actively strengthen propaganda, education, and persuasion; adopt 
appropriate measures in a timely manner; and solve problems at 
their bud and at the grass roots-level in a timely manner. We 
should constantly grasp the initiative in safeguarding political 
and social stability and create a good social environment to 
ensure smooth progress in reform, opening up, and economic 
construction. 
  Cheng Weigao pointed out that this year, we should focus the 
judicial, procuratorial, and court work on dissolving a lot of 
contradictions between the people at the very grass roots, 
positively and deeply wage the struggle against economic crimes 
with the focus on corruption and bribery, and sternly dealing 
blows to serious criminal offenders. He said: 
  [Begin recording] The party committees and governments at 
various levels should have the certificates of responsibility, 
strictly implement the system of responsibility for guaranteeing 
the peace of the designated area, actually form a situation of 
making concerted efforts to comprehensively improve social 
order, and implement the measures for safeguarding stability 
among relevant departments and grass-roots units. The leaders 
at various levels should pay attention to listening to the 
opinions and voices of the masses, be concerned with their woes, 
help them eliminate worries and difficulties, try all possible 
means to solve the problems that the masses [words indistinct], 
and do more good and real deeds for narrowing the relationship 
between the party and the masses. [end recording] 
  In regard to the issue of strengthening the leadership over 
the judicial, procuratorial, and court work, Cheng Weigao said: 
The party and government leaders at various levels should 
regard the judicial, procuratorial, and court work as an 
extremely important work of the party committees and governments 
and put it in a prominent position. We should further support 
the departments of political science and laws to strictly 
enforce laws. We must neither replace the laws by words nor use 
power to prevail over laws. The nation will be powerful when 
its judicial, procuratorial, and court work has been 
strengthened. The nation will become weak when its judicial, 
procuratorial, and court work has been weakened. The commissions 
for political science and laws should realistically assume 
responsibility, make efforts to be advisers and assistants to 
party committees, and make fruitful achievements to embody their 
important positions and functions.

market system composed of both national and local markets, spot 
goods and futures markets, and retail and wholesale markets. 
  An official of the municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce 
said that over the past few years, the city government has taken 
all possible measures to restore Tianjin's status as a commodity 
distribution center for the whole of northern China and turn 
Tianjin into an international commercial city. 
  To date, Tianjin has formed 64 wholesale markets and 28 
national and regional markets for capital goods (iron, steel, 
copper and other raw materials), financial trading, technology 
transfers and labor services, he said. 
  According to the official, the Tianjin iron and steel market 
run jointly by central and local authorities, the Beiyang 
Rolled-Steel Wholesale Market, the Tianjin Petrochemical Trading 
Center and the Tianjin Textile Raw Materials Trading Center are 
now rated among the largest of their kinds in China. 
  These markets have introduced a modern trading system 
including a membership sub-system and involving the trading of 
both spot goods and futures. They are now shifting to futures 
markets, the official said. 
  Moreover, local commodity markets are mushrooming throughout 
Tianjin. On average, every 20,000 local residents are served by 
such a market, he said. 
  In recent years, Tianjin's retail sales have risen at an 
annual rate of 20 percent, totaling 22.7 billion yuan in 1993. 
  Furthermore, lending and borrowing in the local money market 
amounted to 36.6 billion yuan last year, second only to 
Shanghai, the official said. The figure represented a 223 
percent increase over the previous year. 
  A securities exchange and a foreign exchange swap center are 
growing rapidly in Tianjin. 
  Last year foreign banks opened six subsidiaries in Tianjin, 
bringing the number of such subsidiaries to eight, the official 
said. 
  The establishment of a comprehensive market system has made 
it possible for Tianjin to form four pillar industries -- 
automobiles and machine-building, electronics, chemicals and 
metallurgy, he said. 
  These industries now account for at least 70 percent of 
Tianjin's industrial output value, profits and taxes. 
  The formation of a market system has also made Tianjin more 
attractive to foreign investors, he said. 
  In 1993, Tianjin approved 3,528 foreign-funded businesses, 
involving a total overseas investment of 2.26 billion U.S. 
dollars. 
  According to delegates attending a recent economic 
conference, Tianjin plans to build a number of new markets this 
year, including a financial market, an enterprise property 
rights trading market, a technology trading center and a real 
estate market.

  [Text] Tianjin, February 1 (XINHUA) -- After ten years of 
effort, the machinery, electronics, chemical and metallurgical 
industries have taken shape in Tianjin, with their output value 
accounting for 70 percent of the city's industrial total. 
  The municipal government decided recently that it will 
further boost these sectors this year. 
  In machinery, 115,000 automobiles are to be churned out in 
1994. And stress will be put on machine-tooling, hydraulic 
electrogenerating facilities and engineering machines. 
  In the electronics sector, improvement of video recorders 
and 
color televisions will enjoy priority as well as advanced 
telecommunications and computers. 
  The chemical industry will develop high-efficiency 
pesticide, 
first-class paint and other products. 
  And top-flight metal products will top the agenda in the 
metallurgical field. 
  At present, most enterprises involved in these fields boast 
large scale production. And their products have held a large 
market share at home. For example, "Xiali" cars and "Dafa" 
minibuses from the Tianjin Automobile Company have dominated the 
taxi market in large and medium-sized cities. 
  So far, the industrial output value in Tianjin, north 
China's 
No. 1 industrial city, has reached some 50 billion yuan. 
  The city started the development of the four pillar 
industries in the 1980s.

  [Excerpts] From 11 to 13 January, Sun Weiben, secretary of 
the provincial party committee, went deeply to war industrial 
enterprises in Harbin to conduct investigation and studies, and 
encouraged the broad masses of workers to enhance spirit, 
emancipate minds, and blaze new trails in extricating themselves 
from difficult circumstances. 
  Sun Weiben successively travelled to some war industrial 
enterprises with difficulties of varying degrees in their 
current production and operation, including the Songjiang 
Electric Machinery Plant, Dongguang Machinery Plant, and 
Jiancheng Machinery Plant to understand, in details, their 
production and their workers' living, jointly explored measures 
to help them extricate from predicaments along with cadres and 
workers, and helped them solve some practical problems. 
  Sun Weiben said: War industrial enterprises have excellent 
factory buildings and equipment and fairly high quality workers 
and cadres. Many experts and talents are concentrated there. 
The war industrial enterprises are worthy of esteem because 
they can maintain unity at the higher and the lower level, work 
hard, advance despite difficulties and make big strides to 
guarantee the transfer of servicemen to civilian jobs under an 
extremely difficult situation. This spirit is the first light 
leading the war industrial enterprises towards extrication from 
their predicament. 
  Whenever he travelled to an enterprise, he stressed that 
cadres at all levels should change work styles, go deeply to the 
grass roots, support and help the poor, and ensure that the 
broad masses of workers have a peaceful Spring Festival. At 
Dongguang Machinery Plant, Sun Weiben went to a dormitory for 
single workers, and asked about the lives of workers. [passage 
omitted] 
  At the workshop of a war industrial enterprise, Sun Weiben 
conscientiously examined the production lines of military and 
civilian products, and asked detailed questions about the 
development orientation of civilian products, the product 
property, and technological content. Sun Weiben said: The 
fundamental way out for war industrial enterprises is to switch 
to production of civilian products, and the crucial issue that 
remains is the selection of products for production. At 
present, the astronautics industrial enterprises have changed 
their production line and achieved fairly good results. Owing 
to various historical and practical reasons, the arms industry's 
enterprises face fairly great difficulties. However, as long as 
they persist in serving the market, give play to advantages, and 
adjust product orientation, they will see the first light of 
dawn. After affirming these enterprises' plans of developing 
civilian products, Sun Weiben said: It is necessary to give play 
to the advantage war industrial enterprises possess of having 
equipment, technology and trained personnel, and develop 
technology and value-added products that can have a big market, 
and enable them to reach a fair scale. In carrying out new 
construction and transformation projects, we should break with 
common practice, start construction quickly, and put them into 
production rapidly. We may let relevant provincial departments 
take the lead, organize specialists of scientific research 
institutes with achievements to visit some war industrial 
enterprises, and introduce some new items to war industrial 
enterprises in an effort to help them switch production to 
civilian products. We will serve as "match-makers" in this 
regard. 
  During his investigtion and studies, Sun Weiben repeatedly 
stressed: If war industrial enterprises fail to thoroughly 
emancipate the minds, it will be very difficult for them to 
change their production to civilian products, to start the 
second pioneering program, and to extricate themselves from 
their predicament. He said: War industrial enterprises have 
long been shackled by the planned economic structure, and some 
still do not dare to move one step in the minefield or jump out 
from a definite circle. If they "stick to this rule," when will 
they be able to switch production to civilian products? Sun 
Weiben said: The "three criteria" is a major principle and 
proceeding from reality is a major policy. So long as things 
are conducive for war industrial enterprises to extricate 
themselves from the predicament, we may try whatever methods we 
have. We will be good examples so long as we can solve our 
problems. [passage omitted] 
  On hearing that Songjiang Electrical Machinery Plant has 
prepared to introduce foreign capital to raise the production 
capacity and quality of beer, Sun Weiben said: War industrial 
enterprises should dare to break through the forbidden zone. 
They may produce civilian products under the name of other 
brands, introduce foreign capital for grafting and 
transformation, or may even sell part of their idle assets and 
land. 
  Sun Weiben fully affirmed the measures of these war 
industrial enterprises that set up small accounting units for 
independent operation. He said: Setting up small accounting 
units and allowing workshops and sub-plants to operate 
independently is good for mobilizing the enthusiasm of the grass 
roots and urging them to follow the path of supporting 
themselves through their own labor and assuming sole 
responsibility for their profits and losses. One plant may 
adopt two or even three systems, and should strive to vitalize 
each and every workshop if possible. [passage omitted] 
  Sun Weiben expressed that the provincial authorities will do 
everything possible to create conditions for war industrial 
enterprises to overcome difficulties. As for those problems 
which cannot be solved, the provincial authorities will report 
them to the state with the coordination of competent departments 
of war industrial enterprises. 
  Governor Yang Zhihai, and responsible comrades of the 
General 
Office of the provincial party committee, the Policy Research 
Office of the provincial party committee, the General Office of 
the provincial government, and the provincial National Defense 
Work Office also participated in the investigation and studies.

  [Text] On the afternoon of 31 January, the united front 
work department under the provincial party committee and the 
provincial federation of industry and commerce jointly sponsored 
a tea party on the occasion of the Spring Festival in Shenyang. 
  Attending the tea party were provincial leaders, including 
Gu 
Jinchi, Xu Wencai, Yu Junbo, Xiao Zuofu, Sun Qi, Gao Jizhong, 
Zhang Chenglun, and Ma Pinfang; as well as representative 
personages from the non-public units throughout the province. 
They happily got together to jointly view the Spring Festival. 
  Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
delivered a speech on behalf of the provincial party committee 
and the provincial people's government, in which he extended 
cordial regards and festive greetings to the participating 
comrades. He said: By the end of 1993, the number of 
individually run industrial and commercial enterprises and 
privately owned ones throughout the province reached 753 and 
involved 1.3 million persons. Both the number of enterprises 
and number of people involved topped previous peaks. 
Non-publicly-owned enterprises and units have become an 
important force in the promotion of development in the 
province's economy. The situation prevailing among these 
enterprises or units is very gratifying. 
  In his speech, Gu Jinchi urged party committees and 
governments at all levels to continuously give regular guidance 
and support to the work of organizations under the provincial 
federation of industry and commerce. He also urged the 
organizations of industrial and commercial federations across 
the province and the representative personages of non-public 
units to further emancipate their minds; to seek truth from 
facts; to unite as one; to work industriously; and to strive 
together with the people throughout the province to realize the 
second pioneering program, to restore the province's glorious 
prestige, and to build socialism with Chinese characteristics.

  [Text] The provincial land management work conference ended 
on 27 January. 
  The development zone and the real estate boom, that emerged 
in the province last year, have been brought under control. 
Forty-five development zones in the province have been reduced 
and 1,000 mu of land occupied by the development zones have been 
withdrawn. The trend in which development zones wantonly occupy 
and build cultivated areas has basically been brought under 
control. In the latter half of last year, the province also 
generally straightened out the land occupied by the on-going 
projects, carried out the land registration work, and 
straightened out the real estate companies of the land 
departments. The province has straightened out 18,000 cases 
relating to the land occupied by the on-going projects, 
investigated and handled 3,000 cases of illegal use of land, and 
withdrew 2,070 mu of land. Simultaneously, the system of paid 
use of land has been carried out across the province. As of the 
end of last year, the rights to using 19,000 mu of state-owned 
land were sold and 1.8 billion yuan were earned from this. This 
has become the new financial resources for local governments. 
  Last year, the province cut trees and developed land on 
250,000 mu, including 130,000 mu of cultivated areas. This 
figure is roughly equal to that of the land for construction. 
Thus, the good trend of balancing the increase and the decrease 
in the cultivated areas has continuously been maintained. 
  At the conference, Xiao Zuofu, standing committee member of 
the provincial party committee and vice governor of the 
provincial government, made a speech entitled "Strengthen Land 
Management, Deepen the Reform of the Land Utilization System, 
and Accelerate the Inspection of the Land Development Situation." 
  He set forth: In 1994, we should comprehensively carry out 
the paid utilization of the urban state-owned land; and 
gradually expand, on a trial basis, the paid utilization of the 
rural collective-owned areas. The enterprises that carry out 
the shareholding system on a trial basis should embody the 
principle of paid use of land. The land for construction use 
should gradually be distributed according to the orientation of 
the market. The land marketing forms should be dominated by 
inviting tenders and auctioning. We should try by every 
possible means to reduce the negotiation of land forms.

<F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>
  [Text] Fears of social unrest have forced Beijing leaders 
to postpone crucial reforms that were to have been implemented 
early this year. 
  Banking and price reforms would be delayed at least six 
months as a result of the economic crises that hit the country 
at the end of last year, the deputy director of the State 
Planning Commission's Economic Research Institute, Wang Jian, 
said. 
  "The fluctuations shocked the central government leaders. 
They have now reconsidered plans to introduce the reforms all 
at once," he said. 
  In banking, Wang said, plans to put the country's four 
largest specialised banks on to a commercial footing would be 
delayed "at least until the second half of the year." 
  "They will just make the physical separation of the offices 
and the people for now. But there is no specific timetable for 
shifting the banks on to commercial terms." 
  Plans for freeing prices of basic materials, electricity and 
transport, also set for this year, have been put on hold 
indefinitely. 
  Wang said there was a group within the leadership fighting 
the price freeze because of its adverse effect on farmers. 
  "In order to stabilise the whole society, farm incomes must 
rise more than the 2 percent of last year. 
  "My worry is that if you keep a lid on prices of cereals and 
oils for too long, then the benefits of reform will continue to 
be enjoyed mainly by the urban people." 
  Wang said the end-of-year grain crisis and a brief crash on 
the Shanghai stock exchange convinced Beijing that plans for 
what the party leader and State President, Jiang Zemin, called 
"the year of reforms" were too ambitious. 
  "The common people must support the reforms. These 
fluctuations reminded the central governemnt that the people can 
only bear so much reform, and that chaos could easily occur in 
the countryside," Wang said. "They are now on guard against 
these dangers." 
  The November and December grain crisis began in the 
bread-basket provinces of Hubei, Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi and 
Jilin, where rapid mark-ups in grain prices had caused a chain 
reaction of hoarding and grain shortages throughout the country. 
  "This was a national problem," he said. 
  Grain prices, which had already risen 30 percent in rural 
areas by early November compared with a year earlier, began to 
rocket in late November, more than doubling in some regions. 
  Fears of tax changes and Beijing's efforts to control 
inflation led to the Shanghai stock exchange plummeting 13 
percent on December 20, followed by a series of smaller falls. 
  While Beijing leaders felt urban residents could bear high 
rates of inflation because their incomes were rising even 
faster, they were less confident of their ability to handle 
unrest in the countryside because of stagnant income growth 
there, Wang said. 
  The decision to put reforms on hold was taken following a 
national work conference on banking run by Zhu Rongji in mid- 
January. 
  The government would "earnestly strengthen financial 
supervision and management" in 1994, Zhu told the meeting, as 
the "profound problems" of the economy had not yet been 
"fundamentally addressed". 
  Wang said Zhu's sudden reversal of the gradual winding down 
of the austerity programme had not yet filtered through. A 
statement last week by the Vice-Minister of Construction, Li 
Zhendong, that the austerity programme was "basically finished" 
reflected the confusion in Beijing, Wang said. 
  Wang, whose institute is just completing a long-term 
economic 
development strategy for the State Council, said the reforms 
planned for 1994, which also cover taxation, exchange rates, 
investment policy, enterprises and foreign trade, differed 
fundamentally from those of the 1980s because they were designed 
to make the central government stronger, not weaker. 
  He said the reforms could be implemented successfully once 
they were restarted.

<F P=106> [Press conference by Wu Yi, Gu Yongjiang, Shi Guangsheng, </F>
and Liu Shanzai of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation, MOFTEC, with Chinese and foreign correspondents at 
the State Council's Information Office in Beijing on 28 
January--recorded] 
  [Text] [Wu Yi] As you know, the volume of China's foreign 
trade in 1993 totaled to $195.72 billion, an increase of 18.2 
percent over the preceding year. Of this, exports were $91.77 
billion, and imports $103.95 billion, up 8 percent and 29 
percent respectively over 1992. The increase of imports was 21 
percentage points higher than exports, leaving a trade deficit 
of $12.18 billion. In 1993 the country took a giant stride in 
absorbing foreign investment. Foreign investment in China in 
1992 was equal to the total investment in the previous 13 years 
since the policy of reform and opening was instituted. In 1993 
foreign investment was double that of 1992, and was again equal 
to the total amount of the previous 14 years. Last year China 
approved some 83,000 foreign-funded projects, with a total 
contractual value of $110 billion; the actual amount of foreign 
investment was $25.7 billion. Foreign investment in China last 
year had four characteristics: 1) the scale of investment was 
further expanded; 2) the proportion of capital- and 
technology-intensive projects increased; 3) more and more large 
foreign companies and multinational corporations invested in 
China; and 4) the area of investment was gradually extended to 
the hinterland. Businessmen from 126 countries and regions have 
now invested in China. In the remaining time, friends are 
welcome to ask questions. 
  [Correspondent] I am from CHINA DAILY. Would Vice Minister 
Gu please tell us about the progress in negotiations for 
restoring China's membership in the General Agreement on Tariff 
and Trade [GATT]? What are the core issues at present? And 
does China have a specific timetable for rejoining GATT? 
  [Gu Yongjiang] As you may know, China, a founding member of 
GATT, withdrew its membership for various reasons. In 1986 
China applied for the restoration of its status as a GATT 
signatory. In 1987 negotiations began for China to rejoin GATT. 
So far, the China Work Group under GATT has convened for 
several sessions. During the sessions, the Chinese delegation 
gave detailed reports on the progress of China's reform and 
opening up, especially reform in its foreign trade system. In 
1992 discussions on the protocol on reinstitution of China's 
membership began. Hence, the negotiations have entered a 
substantive stage. China also submitted lists of (?samples) 
during the Uruguay Round of trade talks. China will ultimately 
sign a comprehensive agreement on the Uruguay Round and become a 
founding member of the world trade organization, which may be 
inaugurated in the middle or latter part of next year. Before 
the inauguration of the world trade organization, China should 
be a GATT member. 
  [Foreign correspondent speaking in English with simultaneous 
Mandarin translation] I am Webber from NEWSWEEK. My question 
is about the protection of intellectual property rights [IPR]. 
U.S. officials have hinted the next trade dispute with China 
will probably be in the field of IPR protection. Therefore, I 
would like to ask the minister about measures to be taken by 
China to avoid conflict with the United States. 
  [Wu Yi] China and the United States concluded a memorandum 
of understanding on IPR protection in Washington on 16 January 
1992. The Chinese Government has earnestly carried out the 
memorandum, and the U.S. Government has expressed satisfaction 
with the Chinese Government's efforts to implement it. The 
level of IPR protection in China has surpassed the average world 
level. However, I must frankly admit that problems do exist in 
China's implementation of the IPR protection accord. As you 
know, China is a country with a population of 1.17 billion. To 
make everyone understand the law on IPR protection, it is 
necessary to conduct extensive education. As for the measures 
to be taken in IPR protection, we will first conduct universal 
education at different levels to enable people across the 
country to understand the importance of IPR protection. IPR 
protection is not only the demand of various foreign countries, 
but also of our own. We also need to protect our own IPR. What 
is important now is to begin with education on IPR protection 
throughout the country. Second, we will actively suggest the 
establishment of local IPR courts in some key cities. People 
with clear evidence of their IPR being infringed upon may file 
lawsuits with the IPR court. The U.S. Government does not 
understand the Chinese Government's positive measures on IPR 
protection. It is extremely unwise for the U.S. Government to 
apply pressure. 
  [Correspondent] I am (Gu Yunlong) from the Central 
Television Network. Minister Wu Yi, China's trade deficit in 
1993 was over $12 billion. What were the causes? In 1994, or 
in the future, what will China do to maintain a balance between 
imports and exports? 
  [Wu] I think the reasons for the problem of China's 
suffering, a $12.18 billion trade deficit in 1993 were very 
simple. One of the reasons was China's high-speed economic 
development and high domestic market demands; hence there was 
need to import some foreign equipment and materials. The second 
reason was the great development of sino-foreign joint ventures, 
cooperative enterprises, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises in 
1993 which caused the need to import a large amount of equipment 
and some other materials for investment in those enterprises. 
Viewed from another perspective, it shows that China is a 
market of huge potential and that China's market is open to the 
world. On the issue of trade balance, China, of course, wants 
to maintain a balance between exports and imports. But seen from 
a philosophical viewpoint, balance is relative. It is 
impossible to achieve an absolute balance. The Chinese 
Government's attitude toward balance in foreign trade is 
positive. It strives to solve the problem of trade balance 
through expanding its exports and not through the negative way 
of reducing imports. Therefore, we say we seek a balance 
through development. I can tell you that China obtains over 80 
percent of its foreign exchange through exports. If we are 
unable to achieve a balance in exports and imports and if the 
trade deficit keeps growing, then we will not have much 
available foreign exchange, which will affect imports. 
Therefore, we hope relevant countries and relevant industrial 
and commercial circles will actively increase imports of China's 
commodities so as to achieve a coordinated and balanced 
development in bilateral trade. 
  [Correspondent] I am (Anrisen) from TASS. My problem is 
that, Minister Wu, what are your views on the prospects of the 
development of the economic and trade relationship between the 
two countries this year? 
  [Shi Guangsheng] In 1993, the total amount of exports and 
imports between China and the Russian Federation reached $7.68 
billion, an increase of 30.8 percent over the same period of 
1992. Th amount of China's exports was $2.69 billion, an 
increase of 15 percent; and the amount of imports was $4.99 
billion, an increase of 41.4 percent. As all know, China and 
Russia are two close neighboring countries. Both countries 
enjoy geological advantages. The two countries have a strong 
complementary nature in economic terms. As long as both sides 
base their relationship on the principle of equality and mutual 
benefit and increase exchanges and enhance ties, the economic 
and trade relationship between us will make further development. 
  [Correspondent] I am from GUOJI SHANGBAO [International 
Commerce News]. Would you please talk about the effect of 
reform of the foreign exchange structure on China's foreign 
trade? 
  [Liu Shanzai] The recent reform of the structure of foreign 
exchange was crucial to our reform of the foreign trade 
structure. The reform of the structure of foreign exchange will 
further expand our export and import trade, will make the reform 
of our foreign trade structure more compatible with the 
conditions of GATT, and will make our foreign trade structure 
more compatible with the operating mechanisms of common 
international practices.

<F P=106> [Press conference given by Wu Yi, minister of the Ministry </F>
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, MOFTEC, and Liu Shaizai, 
assistant minsiter of foreign economic trade and cooperation, 
with unidentified Chinese and foreign correspondents at the 
State Council's Information Office on 28 January] 
  [Text] Beijing, 28 Jan (XINHUA) -- [Correspondent] What 
are the major contents of China's next-phase reform of its 
foreign trade system? 
  [Wu Yi] To deepen the reform of the foreign trade system, it 
is necessary to uphold a unified policy, liberalize operations, 
compete on an equal footing, take responsibility for one's own 
profits and losses, and integrate industry and trade as well as 
the agency system. The goal in carrying out reform is the 
establishment of a foreign trade operating mechanism suited to 
the rules and customs common in international economic 
activities. The main contents of our next stage of deepening 
the reform of the foreign trade system are as follows: first, 
we will further improve the overall administration of foreign 
trade. The state will mainly make use of such economic means as 
exchange rates, taxation, and credit to regulate foreign trade 
activities. Second, we will deepen the reform of foreign trade 
enterprises and reorganize state-owned foreign trade enterprises 
in accordance with the system of modern enterprises. We will 
explore a new path for "large economic and trade operations" 
characterized by the integration of trade and industry with 
trade and agriculture, with trade and technology, and with trade 
and commerce, as well as the integration of foreign trade with 
foreign capital and foreign economic activities; we will speed 
up the process of granting the right to handle foreign trade to 
manufacturing enterprises, science and technology units, and 
some commercial and materials supply enterprises which are 
imbued with the necessary conditions to do so. Third, we will 
establish a sound foreign trade coordinated service mechanism in 
order to give full play by associations of import-export 
businesses to providing coordinated services. Fourth, we will 
maintain a unified foreign trade policy and system, and will 
increase the degree of transparency in this regard. 
  [Correspondent] China is undertaking a major reform of its 
foreign exchange system this year. What impact will this have 
on the development of its foreign trade? 
  [Liu Shaizai] Reform of the foreign exchange system is 
critical to further deepening the reform of the foreign trade 
system. It will play a very important role in expanding 
import-export trade because it will create a favorable 
environment for all types of export enterprises to compete on an 
equal footing; will speed up the transformation of the operating 
mechanisms of foreign trade enterprises; and will more 
effectively enhance the function of exchange rates in regulating 
foreign trade. This reform will bring our country's foreign 
exchange and foreign trade systems closer to the requirements of 
a socialist market economic structure, will help the 
establishment of an operation mechanism suited to the rules and 
customs common in international economic activities, and will 
play a positive role in restoring our country's status as a 
contracting party to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
  [Correspondent] It has been learned the China Import-Export 
Credit Bank went into operation on 1 January this year. What is 
the status of this bank in the new foreign trade structure, and 
what are its major functions? 
  [Liu Shanzai] The Import-Export Credit Bank is the product 
of the reform of our country's monetary and foreign trade 
system. It is a policy-lending monetary institution whose main 
function is to provide loans to support the export of China's 
capital goods. With further expansion of its business, the bank 
will play an important role in the development of China's 
foreign trade and in linking China's foreign trade with the 
standards of international trade. 
  [Correspondent] How will China reduce its trade deficit? 
  [Wu Yi] The basic principle of China's foreign trade is to 
maintain a rough balance between imports and exports. Last year 
our country suffered a $1.218 billion deficit in foreign trade. 
To deal with this situation, we intend to achieve a balance by 
actively expanding exports rather than reducing imports. The 
purpose of our country's exports is the importation of advanced 
technology and equipment needed for China's modernization drive 
as well as the importation of goods which are in short supply in 
the domestic market. As 80 percent of China's foreign exchange 
income comes from exports, if we fail to turn around the 
situation in which deficits are caused by the slow growth of 
exports, our foreign exchange income is bound to decline, and 
imports will also be affected. I hope our trade partners will 
increase imports of Chinese products so as to maintain a 
coordinated development of bilateral trade. 
  [Correspondent] Will the question of intellectual property 
rights become an obstacle to the development of Sino-U.S. 
economic and trade relations? 
  [Wu Yi] China and the United States concluded a memorandum 
of understanding on 16 January 1992. The Chinese Government has 
earnestly carried out its promise. This has been acknowledged 
by the United States. The level of protection of intellectual 
property rights in China surpasses the average level of 
protection of intellectual property rights throughout the world. 
However, as China is a vast country with a huge population, 
protection of intellectual property rights has been undertaken 
unevenly in various localities. We will begin with education to 
enhance people's awareness regarding intellectual property 
rights, and will propose that intellectual property rights 
courts be established in some key cities. Whether they are 
Chinese or foreigners, if they have clear evidence to prove 
their intellectual property rights have been infringed upon, 
they may file a law suit with the court. Regrettably, the U.S. 
Government does not comprehend nor understand the positive 
method of protecting intellectual property rights which China 
has adopted, and it is unwise for the U.S. Government to attempt 
applying pressure. 
  [Correspondent] What is the current state of Sino-British 
economic and trade relations, and what are their future 
prospects? 
  [Wu Yi] As a whole, Sino-British economic and trade 
relations are not bad, and there is great potential for 
development. However, it is hard to say whether the 
uncooperative attitude adopted by the British Government 
regarding Hong Kong will affect bilateral economic and trade 
relations. This is what China does not want to see, but the 
responsibility rests entirely with the British. 
  [Correspondent] In order to link up with the world 
economically, what new laws and regulations will China enact on 
economic and trade relations with foreign countries? 
  [Wu Yi] With the deepening of the reform of China's foreign 
economic relations and trade system, and the progress of the 
negotiations on the restoration of China's status as a 
contracting party to GATT, China is changing its mode of 
administering foreign economic relations and trade, switching 
from a reliance mainly on administrative means to a reliance on 
legal and economic means. For this purpose, China will enact a 
number of laws and regulations on foreign economic relations and 
trade, the most important of which is the "Foreign Trade Law." 
The draft of this law has been submitted for examination by the 
State Council to the Standing Committee of the National People's 
Congress. China will adopt some methods currently practiced by 
the world community to protect domestic industries. We are 
drafting the "Anti-Dumping Regulations," the "Anti-Subsidies 
Regulations," and the "Regulations on Safeguard Measures." 
These three regulations are expected to be submitted to State 
Council for examination in the near future. In addition, we 
have started drafting other supporting regulations, such as the 
"Regulations Governing the Examination and Approval of Foreign 
Trade Enterprises" and the "Regulations Governing Import-Export 
Chambers of Commerce," both of which are related to the "Foreign 
Trade Law."

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Gong Wen (7895 7186) and XINHUA </F>
reporter Jiang Jun (1203 6511)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 28 Jan (XINHUA) -- Speaking at a State 
Council Information Office news conference today, Wu Yi, 
minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, said: China 
achieved gratifying progress in its trade and economic relations 
with foreign countries in 1993, with a total volume of exports 
and imports reaching $195.72 billion, up 18.2 percent from the 
preceding year. Of this, exports amounted to $91.77 billion and 
imports, $103.95 billion, up 8 percent and 29 percent 
respectively over 1992. 
  One of the outstanding characteristics of China's foreign 
trade in 1993 was the slow growth of exports and rapid increase 
of imports. Last year, China imported large amounts of raw and 
semifinished materials, energy, and equipment because of 
high-speed growth of the domestic economy, large scale 
investment, and robust demand. As a result, the increase of 
imports was 21 percentage points higher than that of exports, 
leaving a deficit of $12.18 billion. According to statistics, 
last year, imported commodities worth over $1 billion included 
mainly aircraft, automobiles, rolled steel, crude oil, finished 
oil, chemical fertilizers, industrial chemicals, and complete 
sets of equipment. Wu Yi pointed out: These imported 
commodities once again show that China is a large open market 
with great potential. She added that China will strive to 
strike a rough balance between exports and imports this year by 
increasing exports rather than reducing imports. 
  Foreign investment in China in 1993 was double that in 1992, 
and was almost equal to the total amount for the previous 14 
years. Last year, China approved 83,265 foreign-funded projects, 
with a total contractual value of $110.852 billion; and the 
actual amount of foreign investment used in the period was 
$25.759 billion. These figures were 70 percent, 90 percent, and 
134 percent, respectively, more than in 1992. The investment 
scale continually expanded, with an average contracted 
investment per foreign-funded project reaching $1.33 million, a 
12.9-percent increase over the $117.8 million of the previous 
year. The proportion of technology intensive projects and 
multinational corporations increased, and the area of investment 
was rapidly expanding to the hinterland.

  [Text] Beijing, January 29 (XINHUA) -- The China Council 
for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), which serves 
domestic and overseas businessmen, will this year initiate a new 
way for China's non-governmental foreign trade to expand, by 
organizing more business people to accompany Chinese leaders' 
visits abroad. 
  Zheng Hongye, chairman of CCPIT, made the statement when 
interviewed by XINHUA recently. 
  He said that in 1993, CCPIT's experimental work in this 
regard witnessed fruitful results, and it will try to 
standardize the practice. 
  During the past year, CCPIT received over 180 overseas 
business delegations to China, up by 50 percent over the 
previous year, 12 of which came with their government leaders. 
  Meanwhile, CCPIT provided various services for business 
people worldwide concerning exhibitions abroad, reception of 
overseas exhibitions to China, trade marks, patents and law, as 
well as promoting economic and trade ties between the two sides 
of the Taiwan straits and dealing with the Sino-U.S. 
most-favored-nations [MFN] issue. 
  Zheng stated that CCPIT aims to promote Sino-foreign trade, 
introduce overseas investment and advanced technology and 
conduct activities of various forms in Sino-foreign economic and 
technological spheres, so as to enhance China's business ties 
with other countries and regions. 
  So far, CCPIT has relations with over 360 business bodies in 
more than 160 countries and regions covering trade, commerce, 
finance, enterprises, industrial property rights, exhibitions, 
law and consultations. 
  It also enjoys cooperative relations with relevant 
organizations in over 50 countries and has set up bilateral 
cooperative councils with some countries. 
  CCPIT now has nearly 300 domestic branches and more than 
20,000 enterprises as domestic members. 
  With its network worldwide, the chairman noted, it will 
function better as a go-between for China's economic and trade 
relations with other countries and regions. 
  As China's economy develops, China's non-governmental 
businesses will be more active and play a more important role in 
China's foreign trade. 
  On Sino-U.S. trade relations, he said that although there 
are 
some frictions, the two economies are strongly complementary, 
adding that business people in the two countries are 
enthusiastic about Sino-U.S. business activities and hope the 
MFN status granted to China by the U.S. can be unconditionally 
extended. 
  He continued that CCPIT is to push forward the development 
of 
Sino-U.S. business ties through non-governmental channels. 
  On business exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan 
Straits, Zheng said that Taiwan's investment in China's mainland 
has risen during the past few years due to the economies on the 
two sides of the straits being complementary, though two-way 
business exchanges have not yet been realized. 
  He hoped that the Taiwan authorities can help realize the 
two-way exchanges as soon as possible so as to enable business 
people from the Chinese mainland to visit Taiwan at an early 
date. 
  If business disputes across the Straits can be solved 
through 
arbitration bodies, it will be conducive to the development of 
such exchanges, the chairman noted. 
  He said that CCPIT is also facing challenges such as the 
role 
of CCPIT in building a socialist market economy, calling it "a 
new task". On this point, he said that CCPIT is to strengthen 
its coordination and service through self-reform to meet the 
demands of a new situation.

<F P=106> [By Ren Kan: "Candidates Chosen for Overseas Flotation"] </F>
  [Text] China has selected 22 domestic enterprises for 
possible flotation on overseas stock markets this year. 
  The list has been submitted to the State Council for final 
approval. 
  However, authoritative sources say not all are certain to go 
forward. 
  The 22 have been strictly selected by the State Council's 
Securities Policy Committee, the China Securities Regulatory 
Commission (CSRC), the State Economic and Trade Commission and 
the State Planning Commission, said CSRC Chairman Liu Hongru. 
  And he said the list was weighted toward enterprises in 
energy, transport, telecommunications, raw materials and some 
key technical renovation projects. 
  They were large industrial firms which have performed 
strongly in the past and continue to have great potential. 
  The majority of them would apply to be listed on the Hong 
Kong stock exchange, Liu said, adding that some will arrange 
listings on other international exchanges such as New York. 
  In 1993, the first nine Chinese enterprises were selected to 
list their shares in Hong Kong. 
  Six of them had issued and listed 4.08 billion H shares by 
the end of last years pooling HK$8.49 billion [Hong Kong 
dollars] ($1.08 billion). 
  And their performance since has been as good as some blue 
chip firms. 
  The remaining three are expected to make their debut in the 
first half of 1994. 
  To ensure the overseas listing develops smoothly, Liu urged 
the 22 firms to pay great attention to their transformation into 
standardized shareholding companies. 
  He called on the firms to carefully appraise their assets 
and 
finance audits. 
  Their staffs should be familiar with international 
accounting 
standards and laws. 
  And he asked firms to carefully select their intermediaries, 
including accountants, law firms and assets appraisers. 
  It was also crucial to select good underwriters, he said. 
  Liu urged the firms to grasp the chance to enter the Hong 
Kong market early, as it is currently bullish. 
  He said more foreign capital will continue to flow into the 
market as prices rise. 
<H5>  The List of Candidates </H5>
  The 22 companies are: Wuhan Iron and Steel Works, Dongfeng 
Automobile, Tianjin Steel Tube, Qingling Automobile, Northeast 
China Electricity Transmission and Substation Equipment, Harbin 
Power Station Equipment, Jingwei Textile Machinery Plant, 
Huaneng International Power, Shandong Huaneng Power, Datang 
Power Plant, Shandong International Power Source Development, 
China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Foshan 
Ceramics, Guangzhou- Shenzhen Railways. Shanghai Haixing 
Shipping, Jilin Petrochemical, Luoyang Glass, Nanjing Panda 
Electronics, Chengdu Cable, Zhenhai Petrochemical and Xian 
Aircraft Manufacturing (International).

"PRC Banks, Including Foreign-Funded Banks, To Start Foreign 
Exchange Transaction Operations as of 1 April"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 27 Jan (TA KUNG PAO)--Effective 1 April, 
the state is to allow some designated banks, including some 
foreign- funded banks, to carry out foreign exchange transaction 
operations, changing the present situation of the banks 
confining their operations to settlement of exchange. At that 
time, the State Foreign Exchange Administration will publish 
average foreign exchange prices based on the banks' transaction 
prices; that is, a floating exchange rate system with controls 
worthy of the name will begin, an authoritative figure disclosed. 
  According to this figure, at present, the Shanghai Foreign 
Exchange Transaction Center is making basic preparations for 
work in this area; and related state departments will make the 
final examination and decision and give approval. The 
designated banks would be members [as published] and have the 
right to conduct foreign exchange transaction operations. Some 
foreign-funded banks might also become members and carry out 
such operations should their applications be approved. In 
addition, they might entrust members to carry out operations in 
this area. 
  Since 1 January this year, the dual-track foreign exchange 
prices have been merged; generally speaking, however, no 
floating rates have been seen in the mainland foreign exchange 
market as of today. The explanation by this authoritative figure 
on this point was: The merger is still at the initial stage, 
and in a transition period at that; hence the plan has not been 
implemented to the full. The State Foreign Exchange 
Administration continues to use the right to fix the average 
prices based on the foreign exchange quotations provided by the 
18 foreign exchange regulation centers across China, that is, 
the previous foreign exchange transaction order is being 
maintained. After 1 April, the designated banks will start 
foreign exchange transaction operations, and then a floating 
exchange rate system with controls worthy of the name will have 
been founded; at that time, some minute fluctuations in foreign 
exchange quotations might surface. The authoritative figure 
especially emphasized that no major fluctuations would arise. 
  The authoritative figure said that with banks starting to 
conduct foreign exchange transaction operations, the existing 
foreign exchange regulation centers across China would face two 
sorts of conversion: First, the dozen or so major local foreign 
exchange centers would become branches of the national foreign 
exchange transaction center; and second, some of the foreign 
exchange regulation centers would be converted to economic 
companies, that is economic companies in the main providing 
foreign exchange information.

  [Text] Beijing plans to close all swap centres in the 
country by April 1. The move follows the announcement on 
December 29 that China was to scrap the dual exchange rate and 
float the yuan from January 1 this year. However, technical 
problems have prevented the new system from operating 
immediately. The first quarter of this year will be a 
transitional period when foreign exchange retention quotas will 
be gradually phased out and an embryonic interbank foreign 
exchange market will come into existence. 
  According to Tsang Shu-ki, senior lecture at Hong Kong 
Baptist College, Beijing aims to connect all swap centres with 
the new system in three months. By April 1, the National 
Foreign Exchange Centre, located in Shanghai, will supplant 
existing swap centres in China and will become a national 
interbank market for appointed banks to trade and settle foreign 
currencies. All enterprises will then have to exchange currency 
with appointed banks. He said: "It needs a transitionary period 
to transform swap-based currency trading into a bank-based one. 
  "By that time, Shanghai will become an interbank centre and 
those banks appointed can buy and sell currencies in the 
interbank market," added Mr Tsang, who has consulted a number of 
Chinese officials from various authorities in Beijing. Alex 
Tang, research director of Yamaichi International, said: "They 
should have enough time to connect all swap centres." 
  Previously, there were three exchange rates in China -- the 
swap rate (8.7 yuan to one U.S. dollar), the official rate (5.7 
yuan to one U.S. dollar) and the black market rate. Companies 
with approvals traded currencies at the 100 swap centres while 
foreigners and individuals with approvals exchanged the yuan at 
appointed mainland banks at an official rate. Under the new 
exchange system, all swap centres will be removed and approved 
enterprises will buy and sell hard currencies at appointed banks. 
  Shanghai's National Foreign Exchange Centre connects 
Beijing, 
Tianjin, Hangzhou, Shenzhen, Xiamen and Chengdu. "At present, 
the satellite network can provide information only. You can't 
make any transaction through the network," said a Shanghai 
source. 
  The national centre is supposed to play an interbank role. 
Beijing has yet to announce the list of members that will be 
allowed to trade at the centre. Mr Tsang estimated that only 
the four specialised banks--the Industrial and Commercial Bank 
of China, the Agricultural Bank of China, the Bank of China and 
the People's Construction Bank of China--and the China 
Investment Bank would be allowed to enter the centre. "The 
centre can not handle too many banks," he added. 
  The new exchange rate will be based on the daily average 
exchange rate traded at the centre one day before. Although the 
new system has already been introduced, details are scant. Like 
the old exchange trading method, the new system offers limited 
access, catering only to companies that need foreign currency 
for their operations.

  [Text] Changchun, January 30 (XINHUA) -- China's largest 
auto joint venture -- the First Automotive Works 
(FAW)-Volkswagenwert Automotive Co. Ltd, located in northeast 
China's Jilin Province -- has expanded steadily thanks to joint 
efforts of the two sides and their good collaboration. 
  This was stated by Claus Wolf, deputy general manager of the 
Sino-Germany automotive corporation, during a recent interview. 
  The FAW-Volkswagenwert Automotive Co. Ltd. was established 
in 
February 1991, jointly funded by the First Automotive Works 
(FAW) of China and the world-renowned Volkswagenwert AG of 
Germany. 
  Substantial progress has been gained ever since with 
modernized workshops towering over former vegetable plots and 
the number of employees expanding to more than 1,400 from merely 
six at the very beginning. 
  Getta sedan cars produced by the joint venture have won much 
favor on the domestic market and total output topped 20,000 by 
the end of last year. 
  Joint ventures are among the most difficult sort of 
enterprises to be managed well due to unavoidable differences in 
cultural and social backgrounds of working staff from both sides. 
  But the employees of the two sides in FAW-Volkswagenwert 
have 
successfully overcome the cultural barrier, if it exist, and 
work together happily, according to deputy general manager Wolf. 
"We are heading toward a common goal, to make the corporation 
better and better," said Wolf. "This helps to remove 
misunderstandings and make us at home here." 
  He deeply felt that both the Chinese and German sides have 
worked wholeheartedly for the success of the project. 
  So far, total funds of the project have reached 7.86 billion 
yuan, with the Chinese side holding 60 percent and German side 
40 percent, making it the country's largest auto joint venture. 
  Collective responsibility system of a management committee 
under the board has been adopted in managing the whole 
corporation. The committee consists of three Chinese managers 
and two German managers. 
  As a member of the committee, Wolf believe that the most 
important thing is to find the best way of working and 
cooperating. "We share one large office and try to hide 
nothing between one another. The three Chinese managers are all 
my good friends. I also feel happy working with the chairman of 
the corporation, Geng Zhaojie, whom I respect very much," he 
said. 
  The joint venture has now adopted the policy of simultaneous 
development of construction, production and increased use of 
domestically-produced spare parts, according to Wolf. Plans 
have been drawn up for management and marketing to as far ahead 
as the year 2,000. 
  Installation of ten-plus production lines has been completed 
and two of them are already in operation. 
  While the sedan cars produced by the corporation are warmly 
welcomed by customers, efforts of hard-working staff are also 
highly appreciated. 
  Talking about an award granted by the Chinese Government to 
him and meeting with Premier Li Peng, Wolf said politely and 
modesty: "It is not an award solely for myself, but for the 
joint efforts of us all." 
  The 52-year-old deputy general manager, who has worked in 
China for almost a decade, is fully confident of the 
corporation's future. With the anticipated annual output of 
300,000 sedan cars by the year 2000, the cooperation will be one 
of China's biggest car producing bases, Wolf said.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by reporter Si Liang (1835 5328)] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong, 24 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Recently, 
domestic and overseas mass media often reported about the "tidal 
movement of migrant rural laborers" in the Chinese mainland. On 
the surface, the "tide" produced quite a few negative effects, 
such as traffic jams, population pressure, worsening 
law-and-order conditions, and poor public hygiene. However, 
behind such superficial problems, there were also many favorable 
factors, and its contributions to the national economy must not 
be neglected. 
  The "tide" involving 15 to 20 million migrant laborers from 
the countryside is a special socioeconomic phenomenon in the 
Chinese mainland. Rural laborers move in large numbers from 
poor and backward areas to economically developed areas. This 
is not only an major way to shift the surplus rural labor force, 
but also an effective way to develop and utilize labor resources 
and to promote employment in the countryside. Although movement 
of rural laborers in large numbers into cities may cause many 
problems for cities and urban communities, most rural laborers 
who have come to cities maintain the virtues of working hard, 
leading a simple and honest life, and being kindhearted. They 
sell their labor and strive to get rich through hard work. They 
are willing to undertake all kinds of heavy manual labor. In 
particular, such dirty, exhausting, and dangerous jobs of 
collecting night soil, removing garbage, dredging sewers, and 
moving stones, which few urban residents are wiling to do, are 
now mostly undertaken by laborers from the countryside. As some 
people said, if all rural laborers leave, some cities may 
certainly become paralyzed. 
  In the mainland, rural laborer have not only contributed 
their strength and sweat to urban economic development, but have 
also built "roads" and "bridges" for raising the rural people's 
living standards to the level of being comparatively better-off. 
After working hard in cities a number of years, some rural 
laborers master certain market information, production skills, 
and management knowledge; at the same time, they also accumulate 
some money. Then, they return home and set up shops, plants, or 
businesses. They thus become a new force for developing 
township and town enterprises and promoting the rural economy. 
Many of them play an exemplary role locally in getting rich. 
According the data provided by the Rural Enterprise Bureau of 
Jiangxi's Ganzhou Prefecture, in the first 10 months of 1993, 
laborers returning home from work in cities set up 1,200 
factories and business companies in their home areas, and made a 
total investment of some 40 million yuan. These institutions 
offered 100,000 jobs to local people. As another example, more 
than 5 million rural laborers from Anhui Province supported 
economic construction in many provinces, and half of them 
mastered skills. Skilled rural workers from Anhui's Wuwei County 
set up more than 30 enterprises after returning home, and they 
all achieved satisfactory business results. Some even export 
their products to overseas markets. 
  In addition to running enterprises after returning home, 
many 
rural laborers also helped their home areas promote sales of 
native products and seek employment channels for the surplus 
labor force in their home areas, as they became better informed 
and had more knowledge and connections. At the same time, they 
also introduced capital, technology, and skilled manpower back 
to their home areas. For example, more than 10,000 rural 
laborers from Gansu's Zhengning County worked in more than 30 
trades in more than 20 provinces and regions throughout the 
country. When earning money, they also brought a large quantity 
of technical information in the fields of crop farming, animal 
husbandry, building materials production, and processing 
industry back to their home area. According to incomplete 
statistics, between January and November 1993, they brought back 
over 1,200 pieces of valuable economic and technical 
information. With the help of their information and 
connections, the county sold one-third of its farm produce to 
other localities, set up 13 shops and plants, dispatched over 
1,000 batches of rural laborers, and increased local peasant 
income by over 30 million yuan. 
  When they were working in economically developed cities, 
many 
rural laborers also received training or studied by themselves, 
thus improving their educational and technical conditions. Some 
people attended night schools to take secondary-school courses 
or even took college courses by means of correspondence and 
television. For example, about 600,000 out of the more than 1 
million rural laborers from Anhui's Fuyang Prefecture working 
outside their home area have taken different forms of vocational 
and technical training. A young girl who worked as a household 
assistant in Beijing learned medical knowledge and skills from 
her employer. In 1988, she returned home and run a factory 
producing more than 10 types of medical-related products, which 
were sold at home and abroad. 
  Along with the industrialization and urbanization of the 
rural economy in the Chinese mainland, the significance of the 
"tide of rural laborers" for the development of urban and rural 
economies is getting more and more prominent.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Liang Chao: "Customs Crackdown Gets </F>
$270M in Goods"] 
  [Text] Customs anti-contraband personnel seized a record 
2.35 billion yuan ($270 million) in smuggled goods in 1993. 
  Of that, a record 1.78 billion yuan ($204 million) worth of 
goods smuggled into the mainland were confiscated by customs 
inspectors, China's major anti-smuggling force, said Qian 
Guanlin, top official of the General Administration of Customs 
(GAC). 
  The value of the two kinds of contraband were up 78 and 83 
per cent over 1992 respectively, Qian said, indicating that 
smuggling still remained as a serious threat to the country's 
reform. 
  But, Qian gave no details about where the contraband such as 
electrical appliances and cars came from and how many smugglers 
were involved in cases uncovered by the GAC and its local 
branches. 
  Yet, a government official who declined to be named said the 
problem stemmed from businesses smuggling goods. "The 
government was suffering from a stubborn headache last year as 
more and more enterprises were found to have been involved in 
large-scale smuggling despite harsh crackdowns," the official 
said. 
  Qian pledged that Chinese customs authorities will intensify 
the crackdown, beefing up its forces to investigate the biggest 
cases. 
  The GAC is gradually establishing a centralized 
anti-smuggling headquarters in charge of special investigations 
on such stubborn cases, Qian said. 
  And, this year, a customs' national internal intelligence 
network will be linked with other law-enforcement and 
intelligence departments. 
  Meanwhile, China will further reform customs supervision 
this 
year by overhauling its external auditing system to follow 
international practices. 
  That means, instead of simply examining imported and 
exported 
goods at customs' checking ports, supervisors will also pay more 
attention to the management and accounts of enterprises engaged 
in foreign trade. 
  It will make imports and exports passing the customs' 
supervision more simple, fast and effective, and suit the needs 
of China's ongoing economic reform. 
  Approved by the State Council, China's cabinet, the GAC will 
establish and carry out its own auditing system this year. 
  Accordingly, the customs' current declaration practice will 
also be improved by setting up service-oriented customs brokers. 
  It is expected that these brokers would be built into a kind 
of business entities holding responsibility for both customs 
authorities and enterprises engaged in foreign trade.

<F P=106> [By Zhang Xia: "State and Local Coal Mines Need Better Team </F>
Work"] 
  [Text] The Datong Coal Mine in Shanxi Province, which 
ranks No 1 in quality, quantity and efficiency in China, has 
been mining without a licence for years, it has been disclosed. 
  And it is only one of 193 State mines in the country in the 
same predicament. 
  The Mineral Resources Law enacted in 1986 stipulates that 
all 
mines need licenses from State authorities. 
  Those set up before 1986, mainly State-owned ones, should 
have additional licenses issued by the Ministry of Geology and 
Mineral Resources (MGMR). 
  To obtain these licenses, however, the mining companies 
first 
need the approval of local governments on the sizes of the mines. 
  But the sizes are not always easy to determine. Many of the 
State mines are usually surrounded by newly established local 
ones. Sometimes their boundaries overlap. 
  Apart from the Datong Coal Mine, there are other big mines 
still awaiting approval from local governments. These include 
Yangquan and Fenxi mines in Shanxi Province, Pingxiang Mine in 
Jiangxi Province and Fushun Mine in Liaoning Province. 
  Licenses for collectively- or privately-owned mines are 
issued by local governments. 
  But some local authorities have, out of regional interests, 
approved the establishment of small collectively- or 
privately-owned mines within the boundaries of existing 
State-owned mines, which have yet to get their licenses. 
  These small mines are posing a serious threat to large 
State- 
owned mines. 
  In Changguang Coal Mine in Zhejiang Province, for example, 
four small separate mining companies were set up within its 
boundaries. As a result, the mine has been almost depleted of 
its entire coal stock. 
  Moreover, the often destructive excavation by the small 
companies has led to a severe waste in resources and has caused 
many accidents, said a ranking official from the MGMR, who 
requested anonymity. 
  Some observers blame the problem on the Mineral Resources 
Law, saying that the old large- and medium sized State mines 
should have been granted licenses as soon as the law took effect 
in 1986. 
  But the MGMR official rejected the accusation. 
  He said that the law should be observed by all concerned. 
  Local governments may face difficult times ahead as some of 
the smaller, privately-operating mines could be closed down once 
the boundaries of State-owned mines are determined. The 
authorities will be expected to compensate the workers made 
redundant by such a move. 
  Unless these problems are resolved, the law will not be 
properly observed, the official said. 
  But government rulings alone will not be enough to resolve 
potential disputes. Instead, careful mediation is needed. 
  In one case in 1990, the official said, local governments 
were required to make a decision, within a month, whether or not 
to grant licenses to a State-owned mining company. 
  However, most local government did not carry out the 
national 
government directive. 
  To help the mediation process, a vice-minister from MGMR has 
been put in charge of solving disputes. Last year, 19 mining 
disputes were settled. By the end of last year, 9,239 or 97.9 
per cent of the 9,436 State owned mines were granted licenses. 
  Both central and local governments should make compromises 
in 
resolving their conflicts, the official said. 
  Mines that encroach on farm land and pollute the local 
environment should pay compensation to the local people. 
Compensation can be made in cash or through other means like 
providing jobs for the locals. 
  In the meantime local governments should not consider only 
their own interests. They should recognize that large and 
medium-sized State mines play vital roles in the national 
economy. They should also take some responsibility for 
protecting precious resources. 
  Before disputes are solved, local governments should not 
approve the establishment of small privately operated mines 
within the boundaries of State mines, the MGMR official said. 
  If companies are found to be operating in such a manner, the 
MGMR will report them to the Standing Committee of the National 
People's Congress and their licenses will be revoked.

  [Text] Beijing, January 31 (XINHUA) -- China is to abolish 
state prospecting and exploitation of its mineral resources, a 
legacy of the planned economy, and incorporate them into the 
socialist market economy it is striving to build. 
  A senior official at the Ministry of Geology and Mineral 
Resources said today that several ministries and commissions 
under the State Council are putting the final touches to plans 
for experimenting with paid development of mineral resources. 
  According to He Xianjie, deputy director of the ministry's 
Department of Mineral Resources Management, the ministry will, 
on behalf of the State Council, exercise overall control over 
the prospecting, exploitation and utilization of mineral 
resources. 
  All mineral reserves -- the 160 kinds already found 
throughout China and those to be discovered -- will be 
state-owned assets, and developers will have to pay for their 
use. This includes both government departments and private 
companies. Prospecting, exploitation and utilization of mineral 
resources will be opened to bidding. "Whoever offers terms for 
the lowest input and the best economic and social benefits will 
be allowed to develop the mineral resources in a specific area," 
he explained. 
  The plans are meant to "rationalize the use of China's 
mineral resources, which, relative to the size of the 
population, are not abundant, and to better protect them from 
being wasted," the official added. 
  Mineral resources are specified as state-owned in the 
constitution and laws. "In practice, however, their ownership 
in a specific area is ambiguous, and this is liable to cause 
waste and unnecessary losses," he conceded. 
  To add value to mineral resources, he said, the State 
Council 
plans to allow the transfer of property rights on 
state-controlled markets. 
  "After a company gains the right to develop the mineral 
resources in a given area, it may transfer it to another company 
on terms agreed upon by the two sides," the official explained. 
  Prospectors will pay rent for the prospecting sites, and the 
right to develop the mineral reserves will be given to the 
company which is the first to find them," he said. 
  "These measures are aimed at encouraging market 
competition," 
he concluded. 
  To make the development of mineral resources truly market- 
oriented, the official disclosed, the state is to promulgate a 
mining law and a law on protecting mineral resources to replace 
the "law on mineral resources" currently in force.

<F P=106> [Decision announced by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and </F>
Economic Cooperation on 5 October 1993: "The Ministry of 
Foreign Economic Relations and Trade and the State 
Administration of Commodity Prices: Expense Collection Methods 
Concerning Warehousing and Storage Activities of Economic and 
Trade Departments"] 
  [Text] Chapter I. General Principles 
  Article 1. Warehouses of economic and trade departments 
(including cold storage, the same below) are the warehousing and 
transportation bases for the circulation of foreign trade 
commodities and part and parcel of China's capacity to earn 
foreign exchange through exports. The present methods are 
specially worked out with a view to urging enterprises engaged 
in storage under economic and trade departments to strengthen 
economic accounting, improve warehousing and storage management, 
continuously offer better services, accelerate commodity 
circulation, prevent stockpiling and waste, and safeguard the 
rights and interests of the depositor and the depositary so that 
warehousing and storage work will better serve the development 
of foreign trade. 
  Article 2. Enterprises engaged in storage under economic and 
trade departments shall earnestly implement the principles of 
"working hard" and "building the country with industry and 
frugality," practice strict economy, combat waste, perfect the 
financial system, and strictly observe financial and economic 
discipline. When conditions exist, all warehouses shall 
establish an expense collection system to calculate profits and 
losses and assess business results. They must have budgets and 
final accounting of revenue and expenditure, do an earnest job 
of financial planning management and financial analysis, and 
strive to improve management. 
  Article 3. Warehouses of economic and trade departments with 
independent accounting, be they managed by warehousing and 
transportation departments in a unified way or managed by 
specialized companies independently, shall collect charges in 
accordance with the provisions of the present methods. (For 
details of expenses standards, see Annexes I, II, III) 
  Article 4. The expenses collection standards for warehousing 
and storage activities of economic and trade departments are 
worked out by adhering to the principle of helping promote 
commodity circulation and improve enterprise operation and 
management. Charges shall be collected on inventories. Losses 
caused by warehouses shall be compensated. All warehouses 
engaged in storage under economic and trade departments shall 
establish and improve various rules and regulations with the job 
responsibility system as the center, strive to improve 
warehousing and storage management, do a good job of the 
maintenance of commodities and the safety of warehouses, 
increase the utilization rate of warehouse capacity and the 
soundness rate of equipment, and on the basis of the already set 
cost rates, strive to cut down expenses, reduce storage costs, 
and increase profitability. 
  Article 5. As the guides for the state, localities are 
encouraged to flexibly use the warehouse rent standards of 
economic and trade departments in light of their own actual 
conditions and make appropriate adjustments with no ceilings set 
on the downward adjustment and with the upward adjustment not 
exceeding the expenses collection standards set by local pricing 
departments for the same items on the same conditions. 
<H5>  Chapter II. Expense Computing Units </H5>
  Article 6. Charges are collected on inventories in 
warehouses by the tonne. Charges for the commodities listed in 
every warehouse entry or withdrawing form which weigh less than 
a tonne shall be computed to three decimal places. When charges 
for such commodities are computed accumulatively at the end of a 
month, decimals following the tonne shall be rounded to two 
decimals. 
  Article 7. Computing expenses by the tonne will take the 
three following forms: 
  1. The weight metric ton: Charges for a commodity or a lot 
of commodities whose volume is two cubic meters and whose gross 
weight is over 1,000 kgs are computed by the weight metric ton 
(gross weight). 
  2. The volume tonne: Charges for a commodity or a lot of 
commodities whose volume is two cubic meters and gross weight is 
under 1,000 kg by the volume tonne, that is, every two cubic 
meters amounts to an expenses computing tonne. 
  3. The area tonne: For commodities which are shipped into 
warehouses and cannot be piled up because of peculiarities or 
because they are small and complex in size, or if the owners of 
the commodities, upon the approval of the warehousing 
authorities, process, select, repackage, and sort out their 
commodities, the charges are collected according to the area the 
commodities actually occupy and the designed load capacity of 
per square meter of ground (or floor), which are converted into 
expenses computing metric tons. Charges for hiring a whole 
warehouse are computed according to the amount of the expenses 
computing metric tons into which 80 percent of the actual area 
of the warehouse and the designed load capacity of per square 
meter of ground (or floor) are converted and also according to 
the quota storage tonnage of the warehouse. 
  Article 8. As far as the commodities warehouses regularly 
store are concerned, to collect charges rationally, warehouses 
shall seriously calculate the gross weight and volume of each 
commodity and make a package list as the grounds with which to 
compute and collect charges. When commodities are repackaged, 
they shall be recalculated. 
<H5>  Chapter III. Commodities Classification </H5>
  Article 9. Valuable commodities include computers, 
refrigerators, television sets, cameras, video cassette 
recorders, precise instruments and meters, special handicrafts, 
historical relics, priceless scrolls of calligraphy and 
painting, rare and expensive crude drugs and ready-made 
medicines, high-quality tonics, and other valuables. 
  Article 10. Commodities needing careful maintenance include 
silk cocoons, filature silk, wool pieces, knitting wool, velvet, 
woolen textiles, silks, and satins and their products (including 
silk, wool, chemical fibers, rayon, blend yarns, and thread and 
its products), leather and leather products, fur and fur 
products, drawnworks, carpets, cigarettes, wines, food, canned 
food, luxurious perfumes and cosmetics, musical instruments, and 
other commodities needing careful maintenance. 
  Article 11. With the exception of live fish and fresh meat, 
cold stored commodities include commodities which need to be 
stored in freezers and cold wind or air-conditioned storehouses. 
<H5>  Chapter IV. Warehouse Charges and Addition </H5>
  Article 12. Warehouses shall collect rents from owners for 
the use of their storerooms, sheds, and goods yards. Warehouse 
charges are collected according to the number of tonnes per day. 
If commodities listed in a warehouse entry form are shipped 
into warehouses in batches, charges shall be collected from the 
entry date of the first batch of commodities, and if commodities 
listed in a warehouse withdrawing form are shipped out in 
batches, charges shall be settled on the withdrawing date of the 
last batch of commodities. 
  Article 13. Warehouses of economic and trade departments 
fall into four categories. They are port-yard revolving 
warehouse, port warehouse, hinterland transshipment warehouse, 
and other warehouses. To avoid the hinterland regions from 
blindly shipping their export commodities to ports or harbors, 
warehouses of the four categories mentioned above shall have 
their own expenses collection standards, with the standards of 
port areas higher than those of hinterland regions (for 
warehouse charges, see the Table of Warehouse Charges). 
  Article 14. Charges for the commodities that can be stored 
in the open air, with straw mats above and pads below, are 
collected at the charge rate of ordinary commodities. Charges 
for commodities kept in the open air, with pads but no straw 
mats provided or with straw mats but no pads provided, are 
collected according to 80 percent of the charge rate of ordinary 
commodities and those for commodities kept in the open air 
without any straw mats or pads provided are collected according 
to 50 percent of the charge rate of ordinary commodities. 
  Article 15. Charges for hiring a warehouse as a whole are 
computed according to 80 percent of the actual area of the 
warehouse. 
  Article 16. To accelerate the circulation of commodities 
kept in the port-yard warehouses and the port warehouses, a 
rational storage circulating period is stipulated and additional 
charges shall be collected for commodities kept in excess of the 
rational storage circulating period. The rational circulating 
period of the port- yard warehouses is three months. Charges 
for the commodities kept in such warehouses longer than three 
months but shorter than six months are collected according to 
200 percent of the related expenses standards and those longer 
than six months are collected according to 300 percent of the 
related expenses standards. The rational circulating period of 
the port warehouses is one year. Charges for the commodities 
kept in such warehouses longer than one year but shorter than 
two years are collected according to 200 percent of the related 
expenses standards and those longer than two years are collected 
according to 300 percent of the related expenses standards. 
<H5>  Chapter V. Charges for Use of Manpower and Mechanical Power </H5>
  Article 17. Charges for shipping commodities into warehouses 
or shipping out, regardless of operational links and the use of 
manpower or mechanical power, are collected by the tonne (gross 
weight metric ton or volume metric ton) without exception on a 
quota basis. Charges for shipping commodities into warehouses or 
shipping out are collected each time (attached the Table of 
Manpower and Mechanical Power Charges). 
  Article 18. Warehouses shall collect charges for loading and 
unloading, at the request of the owner, the commodities which 
are shipped into the warehouses or shipped out according to the 
standards listed in the loading and unloading operation section 
of the Table of Manpower and Mechanical Power Charges. Loading 
and unloading charges for the operations done by social loading 
and unloading teams hired by a warehouse shall be paid by the 
warehouse for owners first, and then it shall square accounts 
for the actual expenses with the latter. 
  Article 19. Charges for the commodities kept under normal 
storage conditions, which owners request to be re-piled or which 
have exceeded the rational circulating storage period or have to 
be re-piled to ensure their quality, shall be borne by owners, 
and they shall be computed according to 100 percent of the 
related prescribed charges listed in the Table of Manpower and 
Mechanical Power Charges. If owners request their commodities 
to be stored in the other warehouse, warehouse entry and 
withdrawing charges shall be collected. During the circulating 
storage period of commodities, if the warehouses re-pile or 
remove the commodities to other places and storerooms so as to 
better upkeep the commodities or expand warehouse capacity, 
whether they use manpower or mechanical power, they shall not 
collect charges owners. 
  Article 20. Charges for weighing commodities when they are 
shipped into warehouses or shipped out shall be collected 
according to the relevant prescribed expenses standards listed 
the Table of Manpower and Mechanical Power Charges. If owners 
request their commodities kept in warehouses to be checked and 
sorted out and singly weighed, re-piling charges shall be 
collected from them in addition to standard charges. 
<H5>  Chapter VI. Container Charges </H5>
  Article 21. The container operation expenses standards are 
worked out in line with the principle of helping develop 
container transportation. For details, see the Table of 
Container Operation Charges. The various expenses standards 
prescribed in the table are applicable exclusively to collection 
of charges from domestic owners by warehousing and 
transportation departments. As for expenses standards for 
foreign owners, they shall be set by the China National Foreign 
Trade Transportation Corporation through a bilateral agreement 
with foreign shipowners. 
<H5>  Chapter VII. Other Charges </H5>
  Article 22. Charges for warehouse labor and procedural 
services in such areas as processing, selection, sorting out, 
packaging, repackaging, patching up of packages in damaged 
condition, pallet-assemblage, mark chopping, mark brushing, 
steaming, drying, laboratory testing, and acting on owners' 
behalf to receive, deliver, transport, submit goods for 
commercial inspection and testing, and make customs 
declarations, and for the use of special railway lines and 
wharfs shall be determined by various warehouses according to 
the standards set by local pricing departments or relevant 
departments. If there are no local standards, the charges shall 
be determined by warehouses and owners through consultations. 
<H5>  Chapter VIII. Settlement of Expenses Accounts </H5>
  Article 23. Warehouses shall settle expenses accounts with 
owners once a month, with the settlement period ranging from the 
26th of the previous month to the 25th of a specific month. 
  Article 24. After receiving warehouses' expenses account 
settlement notices, owners shall promptly check them and 
complete payment procedures, and pay in full within three days. 
Warehouses are entitled to collect interests on those who fail 
to do so within the dateline. Owners have three months to raise 
objections to excessive or short payments, if any, and undergo 
additional payment or refunding procedures without interests 
paid within three months after payments, and objections raised 
after the dateline shall not be accepted for handling. 
<H5>  Chapter IX. Supplementary Provisions </H5>

activities, which are outside the jurisdiction of, but carried 
out by economic and trade departments and the outside operations 
they undertake using their mechanical power facilities are 
computed in according to the expenses methods worked out by 
local pricing departments or relevant departments. 
  Article 26. The expenses standards for warehouses under 
supervision and management of the customhouses and bonded 
warehouses are set in the light of local actual conditions and 
after consultations with owners. 
  Article 27. The present methods shall be substantiated by 
the economic and trade departments and commissions, foreign 
trade bureaus, and commodity prices bureaus (commissions) of 
various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, if 
there are other matters not touched upon. 
  Article 28. Owners' burdens of warehouse charges, their 
settlement methods, and responsibility for breaking contracts 
shall be clearly defined in the warehousing and storage 
maintenance contracts signed by owners and warehouses. When the 
contracts are signed, the present methods shall be regarded as 
an important basis for the related sections of the contracts. 
  Article 29. The power of interpretation of the present 
methods shall be vested in the Ministry of Foreign Economic 
Relations and Trade and the State Administration of Commodity 
Prices. 
  Article 30. The present methods come into force on the date

  [Text] Kathmandu, February 1 (XINHUA) -- All nuclear 
weapon states (NWS) should undertake legal commitments of 
unconditional no-first-use of nuclear weapons against one 
another and no-use of such weapons against non-nuclear states 
(NNWS) and nuclear-free zones. 
  Speaking on "responsibilities of the NWS" at the sixth 
regional meeting on "Cooperation in the Maintenance of Peace and 
Security, and Disarmament", deputy division chief of the 
International Organizations and Conferences Department of the 
Chinese Foreign Ministry Wang Jun said today that all the NWS 
should also enter into early negotiations on the conclusion of 
relevant international treaties. 
  Wang said, "it is our view that conditions for negotiations 
on the conclusion of such multilateral treaties are ripe under 
the new international situation." 
  The NWS as the permanent members of the UN Security Council 
at the same time, are duty-bound to improve cooperation so as to 
better fulfill their special responsibility entrusted by the 
charter for the maintenance of international peace and security, 
Wang stressed. 
  Some 47 delegates or observers from 30 countries or agencies 
attended the three-day regional meeting which opened here on 
Monday [31 January]. The meeting was organized by the UN 
Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the 
Pacific.

Buenos Aires: "Chinese Representative to Conference of 
International Union for Preservation of Nature and Natural 
Resources Seeks Cancellation of Motion on Tibet Issue"] 
  [Text] Buenos Aires, 24 Jan (RENMIN RIBAO)--This morning, 
the 19th Congress of the International Union for Preservation of 
Nature and Natural Resources called a meeting to discuss its 
motions. A spokesman of the Chinese delegation urged the 
congress to withdraw the motion on the Tibet issue. 
  The spokesman pointed out: The motion put forward by 
Australia's Champaign Institute is a purely political one, which 
describes Tibet as "a country" and also incites Tibetan 
independence. This constitutes open interference and 
infringement of China's sovereignty and a violation of 
international law. As everyone knows, Tibet is an inalienable 
part of the sacred territory of China. The formulation of 
"rapid damage to the natural ecology in Tibet" is contrary to 
fact. A host of facts illustrate that Tibet achieves success in 
preserving forest and wildlife. The demand of the Chinese 
delegation was supported by some countries.

<F P=106> [By reporter Lin Minzhong (2651 3046 1813)] </F>
  [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 26 Jan (XINHUA) -- The 19th 
conference of the International Union for the Protection of 
Nature and Natural Resources closed here on 26 January after 10 
days of intensive discussions on protecting the diversification 
of living things on earth and the rational use of natural 
resources, as well as environmental protection and sustained 
developments. 
  This was another important international conference on 
global 
environmental protection after the UN-sponsored conference in 
Rio de Janeiro in 1992 to discuss environment and development. 
The theme of the conference was "caring for the earth and its 
residents." The 1,300 or so representatives from 118 countries 
and regions presented and adopted over 100 motions about 
protecting the environment and promoting sustained development. 
  Unlike previous international conferences on the 
environment, 
experts attending the just-concluded meeting showed greater 
concern for conditions which people depend on for development as 
well as for the rational use of the earth's natural resources. 
They pointed out that the industrial powers' destruction and 
waste of large amounts of resources during their development 
processes must not be repeated. 
  The three-year strategy the conference has drawn up for the 
union consists primarily of urging and assisting countries to 
protect the integrity and diversification of the environment so 
as to ensure the rational use of natural resources, and 
encouraging government and nongovernment organizations to 
continue their cooperation in protecting natural resources. 
  On 25 January the conference, by a majority of votes, vetoed 
a motion sponsored by some members that vilifies the Chinese 
Government for destroying Tibet's natural environment and 
resources. Taking the floor at the conference, the Chinese 
representative condemned the motion, saying that it was a 
political motion intended to incite "Tibet independence." He 
pointed out that the motion's accusation that the Chinese 
Government has ravaged Tibet's environment is "totally 
groundless." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Washington, February 1 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. 
Government appreciates cooperations of the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea (DPRK) in helping account for Americans 
missing in the Korean war, the Defense Department said here 
today. 
  The Pentagon has announced the identification of remains 
belonging to a U.S. soldier previously list as missing from the 
Korean war. 
  "This is the first such identification of remains returned 
to 
us by the Korean People's Army since the end of the war," said 
the Pentagon spokeswoman Kathleen Delaski at a regular news 
briefing. 
  This soldier's remains were returned with a group of 33 
remains that the DPRK handed over to U.S. last November 30. 
  The Pentagon has tentatively identified four other sets of 
remains, but those associations must be studied and affirmed by 
an Army review board before they are announced as positive 
identifications. 
  "The U.S. Government welcomes and appreciates the 
cooperation 
of the Korean People's Army that resulted in accounting for this 
American soldier," Delaski said. 
  "We hope that such cooperation will lead to increased 
results 
in the future," the spokeswoman added.

  [Text] Moscow, February 1 (XINHUA) -- Russia and the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) are ready to widen military 
cooperation, according to the head of the Russian armed forces 
general staff. 
  Colonel-General Mikhail Kolesnikov told visiting NATO 
supreme 
allied commander in Europe Henning von Ondarza today: "Our 
general staff is studying the Partnership for Peace Program, 
which contains good ideas and will boost our rapprochement with 
NATO." 
  The Partnership for Peace Program, proposed by U.S. 
President 
Bill Clinton at a NATO meeting in Brussels early January, was 
later discussed during Clinton's summit talks with Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow. 
  Kolesnikov advised Von Ondarza of the peace-making efforts 
of 
Russian troops in the former Yugoslavia, the Pridnestr region, 
Tajikistan and other regions of the former Soviet Union, the 
ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY reported. 
  As he arrived in Moscow for a four day visit, General von 
Ondarza said NATO intends to discuss details of cooperation with 
Russia. 
  He has so far met Russian Army commander-in-chief 
Colonel-General Vladimir Semyonov, visited the Kantemirovskaya 
Guard Tank Division and acquainted himself with combat training 
and military routine. 
  Kolesnikov said the Russian Defense Ministry hopes the 
contact will improve planning, organization, preparation and 
implementation of peace-keeping operations that involve Russian 
units. 
  According to well-informed sources here, a draft program for 
Russian-NATO military cooperation from 1994 was discussed at a 
meeting between the Russian Defense Ministry and NATO last week 
in Moscow. 
  The draft includes 50 military arrangements, namely exchange 
visits of Russian and NATO military command and experts, joint 
exercises and training, training of Russian officers at NATO 
units and educational establishments and mutual invitations to 
military exercises.

<F P=106> [By Huang Huizhu: "Clinton's Visit to Moscow and </F>
U.S.-Russian Relations" -- BEIJING REVIEW headline] 
  [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton ended his three-day 
formal visit to Russia on January 15, 1994. The U.S.-Russian 
summit and the documents signed by the two sides indicated that 
although there is some progress in building up the U.S.-Russian 
"partnership," disagreements remain on a series of issues 
concerning their own respective interests. 
  Clinton visited Russia after Russia had just elected its new 
parliament last December. The Moscow Declaration claimed that 
the U.S.-Russian relations had entered into a new stage of a 
matured strategic partnership. 
  The first achievement of the visit is that Russia, the 
United 
States and Ukraine signed an agreement on eliminating nuclear 
weapons on Ukrainian soil, removing the major obstacle that has 
been affecting Kiev's relations with Moscow and Washington. 
Ukraine is the third largest nuclear power in the world with 
176 strategic missiles and about 1,500 nuclear warheads, all 
aimed at the United States. Russia is concerned about its 
nuclear neighbor too. After numerous rounds of negotiations, 
while pressing Ukraine, the United States and Russia also made 
certain compromises promising security and economic 
compensation. Ukraine's consent to eliminate the nuclear 
weapons in its territory served to finally relax the United 
States and Russia. Clinton pointed out that only after the 
United States and Russia have built up this "partnership" will 
it be possible for Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine to agree to 
eliminate their nuclear weapons. 
  On bilateral relations between Russia and the United States, 
Clinton reiterated his support for Yeltsin and his reform 
policy. Meanwhile, Clinton also voiced his support for new 
political forces advocating "a market economy and democratic 
values" in Russia. The agreement further pushed bilateral trade 
and economic relations forward. Russia's agreement to sell 500 
tons of uranium to America in the next 20 years settled one of 
the most controversial issues in the bilateral trade war of the 
last two years. Clinton also announced plans to lift most of 
the restrictions on Russia's commodities entering the U.S. 
market, a big gain for Russia which is working hard to become an 
equal trade partner with the West. 
  Another important topic discussed at the summit was 
security. 
While Russia was worrying about NATO's granting membership to 
former Warsaw Pact countries and Baltic nations, Clinton 
appeased Russia with the "Partnership for Peace" plan which had 
just been approved at the NATO summit. To some extent, the plan 
has taken into consideration Russia's security interest and 
decided to achieve the integration of NATO and Middle and East 
European countries through different stages. Thus it put 
Moscow's worries to rest. 
  It was commented that Clinton's visit didn't bring anything 
new into the bilateral relations. The disagreements between the 
two nations on certain important issues will continue to affect 
the development of the bilateral relations, such as the regional 
conflicts in former Soviet Union. Moreover, in regard to 
bilateral economic relations, Yeltsin reiterated that Russia 
doesn't count on America's aid but asks the United States to 
open its market and eliminate trade restrictions. In addition, 
the two sides have differences on the issue of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina and Russia's relations with three Baltic countries. 
  The prospect of the "strategic partnership" between the 
United States and Russia depends on not only the Russian 
domestic political situation, but also on the stand the two 
sides will take on the above issues in the future.

  [Text] Beijing, February 1 (XINHUA) -- More than 30 foreign 
heads of state or government visited China last year, and with 
them, came a large number of entrepreneurs from these countries. 
  In early spring, about 130 Spanish economic figures came 
with 
their Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, who was the first foreign 
government leader to visit China in the year. 
  Then, within several months, more entrepreneurs came with 
the 
Singaporean prime minister, Philippine president, Malaysian 
prime minister and Thai prime minister. 
  A 50-member economic delegation accompanied Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin on his China tour, and many leaders of 
world- renowned corporations came in the company of German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
  Delegations with the prime ministers from Austria and New 
Zealand and the president of Mexico were also well stocked with 
people from their economic circles. 
  Observers noted here that so many economic delegations came 
to visit China along with the top leaders of their countries was 
a new development in recent years, last year in particular. 
  The development, they said, indicated that the economic 
circles of foreign countries attached greater importance to the 
Chinese market, and that Sino-foreign exchanges are becoming 
more pragmatic. 
  During their visit, foreign entrepreneurs saw for themselves 
the achievements China has made in the reform and opening drive, 
and this helped enhance their interest in investing in China. 
  They made extensive contacts with people from the Chinese 
economic circles, and signed many documents of cooperation. 
  Several cooperative agreements were reached between China 
and 
Spain; with the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia, China signed 
nine, ten and 30 agreements, respectively; over 20 Sino-German 
agreements were signed last year, worth 2.8 billion U.S. dollars. 
  More important, the visits indicated that China's trade 
partners, such as Thailand and Malaysia, the Western developed 
countries and the Latin-American countries are attaching great 
importance to developing bilateral trade and economic ties with 
China. 
  Their governments also encouraged their economic circles to 
invest in China. Almost all leaders expressed such intention 
during their stay in China. 
  Prime Minister Gonzalez told Chinese and Spanish 
entrepreneurs that investors should choose regions where 
long-term economic growth could be maintained, and China is such 
a region. 
  "The Spanish Government is aware of it, and will support 
investment in China," he said. 
  According to Goh Chok Tong, Singaporean prime minister, his 
government encourages its people to invest abroad, and China is 
the place to which "they should give priority". 
  Fidel Ramos, president of the Philippines, said that his 
government wants every Philippine businessman to see China 
personally and get to know China's economic achievements of 
recent years. 
  Chancellor Kohl also said that Germany is "very interested" 
in developing relations, especially economic and trade 
cooperation, with China. 
  On the other hand, the entrepreneurs got pledges from the 
Chinese Government that the country will stick to its reform and 
opening policy. 
  Premier Li Peng told visiting Spanish entrepreneurs that 
China will open wider to Western countries, including opening 
markets previously restricted in China. 
  When meeting with German economic figures, Premier Li Peng 
said that the socialist market economy should be connected with 
the world economy, and he expressed his hope that foreign 
investors would put their investments into construction in the 
fields of infrastructure, such as transportation, energy and 
telecommunications. 
  Observers said that the visits by such a large number of 
entrepreneurs with heads of state or government showed that 
Sino-foreign economic and trade cooperation will develop further 
in the years to come, and such cooperation will be of mutual 
benefit.

Singapore at noon today and later went to the Presidential Hall 
to call on Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew. The two held cordial 
and friendly talks. 
  The seven-member Henan provincial delegation headed by Li 
Changchun will make an eight-day friendly observation tour in 
Singapore at the invitation of Minister of Information and the 
Arts Yeo Yong Boon. Nineteen economic and trade officials and 
entrepreneurs from Henan Province have come with the delegation. 
  During their talks, Li Changchun briefed Lee Kuan Yew on 
Henan's ancient culture and history, communications and 
transportation facilities, tourism environment, mineral 
resources, and the current economic foundation and development 
plans of the province. He invited Lee Kuan Yew to visit Henan 
and hoped people from industrial and business circles in 
Singapore would invest in Henan. 
  Lee Kuan Yew happily accepted the invitation and said he 
might visit Henan this autumn. Lee Kuan Yew suggested that to 
develop the economy and strengthen contacts with the outside 
world, Henan should first improve its railroad, highway and air 
transporation, and communications facilities. After the 
improvement of transporation and communications facilities, 
Henan will be closer to the outside world. With more people 
visiting Henan, the province will have more opportunities for 
economic and trade cooperation. 
  During the visit, the Henan provincial delegation will also 
call on other Singapore Government officials and visit 
Singapore's Yulang Town Industrial Administration, Civil 
Aviation Bureau, Trade and Development Bureau and other 
organizations. Li Changchun will hold a lecture meeting on 
"opportunities for investment in and trade with Henan."

  [Text] Hanoi, January 31 (XINHUA) - Vietnam's leading 
newspapers have published editorials and articles critical of 
United States plan to start a "Radio Free Asia" service, calling 
the plan "wanton interference in the internal affairs of Asian 
countries. 
  Setting up "Radio Free Asia" is a mistake by the United 
States, a Foreign Ministry spokesman was quoted as saying in 
all daily newspapers. 
  The U.S. Senate last week debated legislation on the 
creation 
of a the radio station, which President Bill Clinton proposed in 
June, that would broadcast to Myanmar [Burma], China, Laos, 
Vietnam, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). 
  The Vietnamese spokesman said, "the people of Asia believe 
the aim (of the radio station) is to impose foreign political 
points of view on them. It represents clear interference in 
their internal affairs as it aims to provoke instability in 
these countries." 
  The plan would not only be harmful to economic and social 
development in Asian countries but also would affect relations 
between these countries and the United States, he added. 
  "NHAN DAN" (the PEOPLE'S DAILY) said in an article today 
that 
the U.S. Senate's decision was completely counter to the trend 
of peace, stability, and cooperation in Asia and in the world. 
It also violates international law, the paper pointed out. 
  "QUAN DOI NHAN DAN" (the PEOPLE'S ARMY newspaper) said in a 
Sunday article that the U.S. decision was a product of the Cold 
War period and went against the general trend in the Asian 
region. 
  The army newspaper said U.S. President Bill Clinton and many 
other U.S. senior officials have stated that they respect the 
sovereignty and the right to self-determination of other 
countries, and would not intervene in the internal affairs of 
other countries. The paper said it was a pity that U.S. 
authorities have now gone back on their word and violated 
international law. 
  The article expressed the hope that the United States would 
make a correct decision in accord with the general trend in Asia 
and the world.

  [Text] Beijing is reshuffling senior officials in charge 
of Hong Kong affairs in an effort to secure a balance of power 
among competing factions and ensure a smooth transition in 1997. 
Zhou Zhekai, secretary general of the Association for Relations 
Across the Taiwan Strait, will replace Lin Keping as head of the 
co-ordination department of the Hong Kong branch of the New 
China News Agency (Xinhua), Beijing's de facto embassy here, 
according to sources. 
  Zhou will be in charge of "united front work", which means 
liaison and control of "friendly" local organisations in the 
territory. Lin, who came to Hong Kong to replace Yang Sing in 
1990, is expected to retire. Zhou Zhekai, who is in his early 
forties, is a protege of Wang Zhaoguo, a rising party leader who 
heads the party's United Front Work Department in Beijing. Zhou 
plays a key role in cross-strait negotiations with Taiwan. This 
week, he is hosting a round of "unofficial" talks with his 
Taiwan counterparts. 
  Zhou worked with Wang in Fujian Province in the late 1980s, 
then moved with his mentor to Beijing when Wang became head of 
the party's Central Office for Taiwan Affairs. As a Taiwan 
affairs expert, Zhou poses a potential threat to Wang Zhenyu, 
the head of Xinhua's Taiwan affairs office. 
  A reshuffle is also under way within the State Council's 
Hong 
Kong and Macao Affairs Offce (HKMAO). Though not yet officially 
announced, this could be the most significant shake-up since 
1990, at the time of the promulgation of the Basic Law for the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. In 1990, Ji Pengfei 
and Li Hou, director and deputy director of the HKMAO, retired 
to make way for Lu Ping and other middle-aged cadres. This 
time, Wang Fengchao will be made a deputy director, replacing 
Wang Qiren, who has been named president of the Bank of China. 
  Wang's appointment suggested an attempt to maintain a 
balance 
of power among competing factions, sources said. Wang is 
considered relatively moderate compared to Chen Ziying, the 
other deputy director, who is in charge of foreign affairs and 
negotiations with Britain over the new airport at Chek Lap Kok. 
But his appointment does not necessarily mean that Beijing will 
modify its hard-line stance on Hong Kong. 
  Wang's responsibilities will include negotiations on 
political reforms and preparatory work leading up to the 1997 
transition. He was previously a deputy director of the 
Institute of Journalism at the Chinese Academy of Social 
Science, but he became involved in policymaking on Hong Kong and 
Macao affairs during the late 1980s and participated in last 
year's Sino-Hong Kong talks on political reform. 
  His wife, Lei Yuping, deputy chief of the All China 
Journalists' Association, is in charge of dealing with Hong Kong 
and Taiwan journalists in Beijing. Her father, Lei Yingfu, 
accompanied the then Chinese Communist Party leader, Zhou Enlai, 
during the 1946 negotiations with the Kuomintang in Chongqing. 
  In addition to Wang, three young cadres educated in 
Guangdong 
in the early 1980s are due to receive promotions. Chen Zuoer, a 
department head at the HKMAO, will replace Luo Jiahuan on the 
Sino-British Joint Liaison Group in Hong Kong, sources in 
Beijing said. 
  Chen Guangming, also a department head, will be transferred 
to the Taiwan Affairs Office of Guangdong province, clearing the 
way for a promotion for his deputy, Xe Ze, who was Lu Ping's 
assistant during the drafting of the Basic Law. 
  Zheng Liandong, who was involved in drafting the Basic Law, 
will also be promoted. In 1990, Zheng was sent to Hong Kong to 
join the Chinese team of the JLG as first secretary and later 
studied in Britain for one year. Guo Fengmin, leader of the 
Chinese side in the JLG, is expected to retire soon. He will be 
replaced by Zhao Jihua, director of the separate Foreign 
Ministry office handling Hong Kong and Macao affairs.

<F P=106> [By So Lai-Fun] </F>
  [Text] There were positive signs from China yesterday 
regarding a British offer to substantially raise the amount of 
capital to be injected into the Chek Lap Kok airport and its 
associated railway. The offer to pump more than $60 billion 
into the Provisional Airport Authority and the Mass Transit 
Railway Corporation to facilitate an early agreement with 
Beijing on the projects was endorsed by the Executive Council 
[Exco] yesterday. 
  Details of the multi-billion-dollar bid to kick-start the 
vast infrastructure plan were revealed exclusively in the South 
China Morning Post. Governor Chris Patten said the new offer, 
discussed during a three-hour session of Exco, would address all 
Chinese concerns, given the healthy state of Hong Kong's 
reserves. "I hope that (China) would find this an excellent 
Lunar New Year present for Hong Kong, for China, for everyone," 
Mr Patten said. 
  Chinese sources welcomed the prospect of a much bigger level 
of capital investment in the two corporations by the Government 
and a Hong Kong affairs adviser, Tsang Yok-shing, added a note 
of optimism. Mr Tsang returned from Beijing after presenting 
Chinese officials with proposals from the Democratic Alliance 
for the Betterment of Hong Kong that require the territory to 
inject $90 billion of the $99.2 billion total cost of the two 
projects. Mr Tsang, alliance chairman, said he believed that if 
Britain agreed to raise the level of capital investment and 
sought consultation with China for any borrowings by the two 
corporations exceeding $5 billion, the airport financing problem 
could be resolved. 
  A mainland official stressed that China remained flexible on 
the amount of capital injection although it insisted that the 
overall financing arrangements should be considered as a 
package. Noting that China was always flexible on the level of 
government fundings, he said: "The British side should at least 
explain to us why they could not accept our proposal. 
  "There should not be any different understandings over the 
definition of government borrowings... That's what we have 
discussed all the way after the signing of the Memorandum of 
Understanding on the airport," the official said. He said the 
land issue was also negotiable as China was flexible on whether 
it would allow the 62 hectares of airport railway land to be 
counted outside the annual land disposal quota of 50 hectares. 
However, the official stressed that the Airport Consultative 
Committee should be given a more important role to monitor the 
costs of the whole programme. 
  Mr Patten said the Government would pass the new proposal to 
the Chinese side as soon as possible and he would like to see an 
early meeting of the Joint Liaison Group Airport Committee. But 
the increase in capital injection is understood to be contingent 
on China allowing the 62 hectares of land along the airport 
railway to be counted separately from the 50 hectares sold by 
the territory every year under Annex Three of the Joint 
Declaration.

<F P=106> [By Rain Ren and Wing Kay Po: "Mainland No To Funds for </F>
Airport"] 
  [Text] China has rejected the Government's latest airport 
funding proposals despite enormous concessions offered by the 
administration. A New China News Agency (Xinhua) official has 
snubbed the offer on the grounds that it falls short of China's 
demands. The Xinhua official said Beijing still insists that 
the maximum debts for the Special Administrative Region (SAR) 
government should not exceed $20bn. The latest funding 
proposals would leave the SAR government between $20bn and $30bn 
in debt. 
  The official maintained that the Government is still 
breaking 
the Memorandum of Understanding which stipulates that Government 
borrowing should not exceed $5bn without China's blessing. The 
Executive Council yesterday approved a new funding proposal 
which involves an equity injection of about $60bn into the 
Provisional Airport Authority and the Mass Transit Railway 
Corporation. 
  China has been angered further by the Governor, Chris 
Patten, 
calling the concessions a "new year present". The official, 
obviously upset by the Governor's remarks, said: "It is not his 
present. The money belongs to Hong Kong people." 
  There was an indication that China may be willing to soften 
its stand, despite its initial harsh reaction to the proposals. 
The Xinhua official welcomed the Government's overtures, 
hinting Beijing may be willing to negotiate on the latest offer 
at a reconvened airport committee meeting. There has been no 
airport committee meeting under the Joint Liaison Group since 
last August. Beijing may also be willing to be more flexible on 
the sale of land along the airport railway. 
  A spokesman from the Chinese side of the Sino-British Land 
Commission was cautious in his reaction. "The disposition of 
the airport-related land is part of the overall funding package 
of the new airport," he said. As long as the Government can 
assure China that the 62 hectares of land over the airport rail 
link stations will be sold in phases over the next three years, 
Beijing would not insist that it should be included in the 
annual land sale programme. 
  China's official reaction has been echoed by Tam Yiuchung, a 
Pro-China legislator and the chairman of the Democratic Alliance 
for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB). He said that the 
Government's proposal would still not satisfy China. "Sixty 
billion might sound a lot, but it's only $15bn more than the 
Government had already agreed to inject into the airport in its 
last proposal," he said. DAB proposed last week that the 
Government provide a total of $89.2bn for the $99.2bn airport 
and related railway project. 
  The Government is likely to face an uphill battle in getting 
Legislative Council support for the new airport funding 
proposals. The United Democrats' spokesman on the airport, 
Albert Chan, said his party will not accept a $60bn equity 
injection into the airport unless the proceeds from land sales 
are included. Chan said that this equity should not come 
entirely from the Hong Kong government, but also from the SAR 
government. Chan said that he felt that China's demands were 
"unreasonable" and that the Government had been "weak" in 
complying with China's wishes. 
  Howard Young, a Liberal Party legislator, said his party 
would only approve a financial package affordable to Hong Kong. 
"We will examine very carefully if the amount of equity 
injection would have an adverse impact on social expenditure and 
public works," Young said. "We'll look at any plan in the 
context of Hong Kong's overall financial situation, its 
surpluses and reserves," he added.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Stop the Talking, Finish the Airport"] </F>
  [Text] It is hard to find more than a handful of people in 
Hong Kong who do not believe the territory needs a new airport. 
It is equally hard to see any light at the end of the tunnel 
during Sino-British negotiations on the building of the Chek Lap 
Kok airport. The simple fact of the matter is that the airborne 
conveyance of passengers and cargo has become a political 
football. 
  The Hong Kong Government is poised to make yet another offer 
to the Chinese government designed to quell its anxieties on the 
accumulation of public debt for the purpose of building the 
airport. Slamming billions of dollars down on the negotiating 
table in the hope of securing a deal, the government is 
effectively undermining all its original plans for the project. 
  In 1989, when then Governor David Wilson announced the plan 
for the new airport, he solemnly assured the public it would be 
largely financed by the private sector and would be open for 
business in 1997. 
  Now it is clear that the bulk of the funding will come from 
the public purse and it seems increasingly unlikely that a 
single aircraft will brush its wheels along the carefully 
levelled runway in 1997. 
  Large scale private financing has been virtually ruled out 
by 
China's insistence that capital should be collected without the 
subsequent accumulation of debt. With no guarantee of Chinese 
support, raising funds in the private sector is near impossible. 
Steadily the Government has moved to satisfy China's demanding 
fiscal requirements, but to no avail. In desperation Governor 
Chris Patten cries out for "China to take yes for an answer" in 
responding to British offers on airport financing. However, 
Patten and everybody else knows that the Chinese government will 
not take yes for answer because it is asking a different 
question. Put bluntly, the airport is being held hostage to the 
wider political dispute about the extension of representative 
government in Hong Kong. Until that matter is settled it is 
highly unlikely that other matters of substance will come close 
to a settlement. 
  Even though this is widely known by the British, Hong Kong 
and Chinese governments, they plunge merrily through the charade 
of pretending they are talking about the airport when it is 
obvious that they have a completely different agenda. 
  In 1991 the British Prime Minister, John Major, dispatched 
his special envoy Sir Percy Cradock to hold secret talks in 
Beijing aimed at breaking the impasse. Sir Percy returned 
triumphant, at least this was his version of events. 
  Clasping a scrap of paper called the Memorandum of 
Understanding, Britain and China declared that an agreement had 
been reached. Sir Percy, on Britain's behalf secured this 
so-called agreement by the simple expedient of saying yes to 
everything China asked for. Yet, today, it is palpably clear 
that the agreement was hardly worth the paper it was printed on. 
There can be no agreements on anything of substance while 
Sino-British relations remain at their current low point. It is 
a cruel deception to pretend otherwise. 
  The duty of all governments concerned is to acknowledge this 
reality and decide how they should move forward without 
hypocrisy. 
  In the case of the airport this means proceeding with the 
project on public funds until such a time that the general 
atmosphere in relations improves. If it does not and the drain 
on resources becomes too onerous, the Government will have to 
stop building and leave it to the incoming administration to 
complete the job. At any rate let's get a move on. The 
solution we suggest is far from satisfactory but much closer to 
reality than anything we have heard emanating from so-called 
Sino-British negotiations. 
  The likelihood is that the airport will open after the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region is established. The British 
may feel cheated that their biggest monument will not be blessed 
by the outgoing sovereign power, the Chinese may be rubbing 
their hands with glee at the prospect. 
  For Hong Kong it does not matter who opens the wretched 
airport, be it in June 1997 or July, after the takeover. The 
important thing is that it opens soon.

<F P=106> [By Hedley Thomas] </F>
  [Text] A Hong Kong triad syndicate allied with mainland 
criminals in the manufacture and distribution of the synthetic 
drug "ice" has been smashed in what authorities describe as a 
major coup. A makeshift laboratory used to make the haul of 
about 22 kilograms of pure ice was discovered during raids by 
more than 40 officers from the Narcotics Bureau and the 
Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). Two boys aged 
about 10 were delivered into the care of the Social Welfare 
Department yesterday after officers found them living in a Sha 
Tin flat used by members of the 14K Yee triad to manufacture and 
store the drugs. 
  "This is the first ice manufacturing case in Hong Kong for 
17 
years and the second largest seizure ever made," said Detective 
Chief Inspector Yeung Tak-keung, head of the bureau's export 
section. The ice was destined for the Philippines, where it 
would have retailed for about $10 million, compared with a Hong 
Kong wholesale value of $700,000. 
  Authorities said the busts did not indicate Hong Kong was 
becoming a burgeoning market for ice. "In the Philippines and 
Japan, ice is the drug of choice. In Hong Kong, heroin remains 
the drug of choice. Ice doesn't have a market here," said ICAC 
Chief Investigator Mike Squires. Mr Squires said four people 
arrested were members of the 14K Yee triad society whose 
official meeting place above a shop in North Poin was also 
uncovered in the raids. 
  In the past, Hong Kong has been mainly used as transit point 
for ice manufactured in laboratories in southern China and 
shipped to countries including the Philippines, Japan, Taiwan, 
South Korea and Hawaii. "We believe the syndicate has been 
active in ice trafficking for some time, but we believe we broke 
it up at the beginning of their plans to manufacture it in Hong 
Kong," Chief Inspector Yeung said. 
  He said the synthetics used to make the ice had come from a 
mainland crime group operating near Guangzhou and smuggled to 
Hong Kong for final processing in the Sha Tin flat. "They were 
importing the mixture from China and then treating it and 
combining it with other liquids in Hong Kong until it 
crystallised and was in its purest form," Chief Inspector Yeung 
said. 
  The 22 kg of ice and most of the manufacturing paraphernalia 
were found in the flat with the boys' 42-year-old mother, who 
was arrested. "The children were living in a flat used as an 
ice factory, but we do not believed they were using drugs. It's 
a pity that such things happen to them at that age," Chief 
Inspector Yeung said. Three men, including the suspected 
ringleader and self-taught chemist and two would-be couriers, 
were arrested during raids on Monday night and early yesterday 
at premises in North Point. Four machete-type knives and a 
small quantity of heroin were also seized.

<F P=106> [By S. C. Tsai] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 1 (CNA) -- Shih Ming-teh, chairman of 
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Tuesday [1 
February] pledged that the party would strengthen cooperation 
with Taiwan's business community. 
  During a breakfast meeting with senior business executives 
on 
the 1994 economic outlook, Shih said a series of similar 
meetings will be held to promote understanding between the DPP 
and the domestic business circle. 
  More than 20 business executives were present at the Tuesday 
meeting, while the DPP was represented by Shih, chairman Yang 
Huang Mei-hsing of the foreign affairs department, chairman 
Chiang Peng-chien of the China Affairs Committee, and 
legislators S. P. Chen, P.H. Peng, F. H. Shen, and T.T. Hsu. 
  Chang Kuo-an, chairman of the Fengchun Group, expressed the 
hope that lawmakers of the major opposition party will help 
revise outdated rules and regulations to cope with the economic 
development vital to Taiwan's future. 
  The statement was echoed by Chen Sheng-tien, chairman of the 
Sampo Group. Chen said lawmakers must monitor the executive 
branch with a view to improving executive efficiency. 
  Two major problems now facing the Taiwan economy are how to 
create wealth and the equitable distribution of wealth, Chen 
added. 
  On Taiwan's policy toward investment in Mainland China, Hsu 
Hsien-jung, president of Prince Motors Co., Ltd., pointed out 
that the government should map out a set of workable measures 
for the private sector to follow. "It's a trend that domestic 
enterprises will increase investments in Mainland China," he 
noted. 
  Moreover, Hsu stressed, the government should set a 
timetable 
for further financial liberalization in its ambition to build 
Taiwan as an Asia-Pacific business operations center. 
  Liu Tai-ying, chairman of the China Development Corp., 
however, said he saw nothing in the DPP's industrial policy. "I 
don't understand its attitude toward trade ties across the 
Taiwan Strait," he added. Liu is concurrently chairman of the 
ruling Kuomintang's enterprises management committee. 
  Shih said after the meeting that the party is not 
anti-business and any such impression is a mistake. 
  To enhance understanding between the party and private 
enterprises, similar meetings will also be held in central and 
southern Taiwan, he noted.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 2 (CNA) -- The 1994 energy research 
&amp; 
development and technology transfer seminar of the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum opened at the Taipei 
International Convention Center Wednesday [2 February]. 
  More than 180 industry, academic, and government 
representatives from 17 APEC member countries are taking part in 
the two-day energy seminar. 
  Discussions focus on three main areas -- "technology to 
convert wastes into energy sources," "efficient energy 
utilization technology in urban areas," and "the effective 
utilization of energy for the creation of improved amenities." 
  This is the first time that Taiwan has hosted an APEC 
seminar 
since it joined the regional organization in 1991. The energy 
seminar is co-sponsored by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and 
Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry. 
  Addressing the opening ceremony on behalf of Economic 
Affairs 
Minister P.K. Chiang, Vice Economic Affairs Minister Sheu 
Ke-sheng expressed the hope that this seminar and other similar 
gatherings will help strengthen cooperation among APEC members 
on energy conservation and efficiency improvement. 
  The Asia-Pacific region, which had the world's fastest 
economic growth over the past decade, still faces the challenge 
of solving the "3e" problems of energy, economics, and 
environment, Sheu said. 
  It is therefore most appropriate that "new and efficient 
energy technology to create a safe, clean, and comfortable 
environment for the next decade" has been chosen as the main 
theme of the forum, he explained. 
  In Taiwan, he noted, the government is also plagued with 
"the 
emerging problems in energy demand and their environmentally 
unfriendly potential, both locally and internationally." 
  In addition to increased domestic reserach in new energies, 
waste management, and efficiency upgrading, Taiwan has also 
initiated "research programs, that take on a more universal 
significance, in carbon dioxide omission control and alternative 
refrigerants," he pointed out. 
  APEC, founded in 1989, groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, 
Mainland China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New 
Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, 
Thailand, the United States, Papua New Guinea, and Mexico.

  [Text] Beijing, 1 Feb (XINHUA) -- Discussions between 
responsible individuals from the Association for Relations 
Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] and Taiwan's Straits Exchange 
Foundation [SEF] on implementing the agreements of the "Wang-Gu 
talks" were held in Beijing today. ARATS Executive Vice 
Chairman Tang Shubei and ARATS Vice Chairman and Secretary 
General Zou Zhekai held the first round of talks with SEF Vice 
Chairman and Secretary General Jiao Renhe [Chiao Jen-ho] at the 
Diaoyutai Guesthouse this afternoon. 
  Prior to the talks, Tang Shubei noted: Since we successfully 
held the "Wang-Gu talks" and signed agreements, the two 
organizations have made some progress in implementing the 
agreements. During Mr. Jiao Renhe's visit to Beijing, both 
sides will exchange views on implementing the agreements. This 
is an excellent opportunity. Jiao Renhe also indicated: 
According to the "Agreement on Establishing a System of Making 
Contacts and Holding Talks Between the Two Organizations" signed 
during the "Wang-Gu talks," the vice chairmen or secretaries 
general of the two organizations will, in principle, meet and 
hold talks once every six months. The time for doing so has 
passed. Coordination between the two organizations for 
implementing the agreements has been largely good over the past 
nine months. During the current talks, we will exchange views 
on better implementing the agreements. 
  After the talks, Tang Shubei and Jiao Renhe gave separate 
briefings on the talks and answered reporters' questions. Tang 
Shubei said that during today's discussions, he first forwarded 
ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan's letter to SEF Chairman Gu Zhenfu 
[Ku Chen-fu], in which the former invited the latter to visit 
the mainland this year. Afterward, the two sides exchanged 
views on progress in implementing the agreements of the "Wang-Gu 
talks" over the past six months or so. They also discussed 
current conceptual issues affecting progress in discussions on 
affairs of a routine nature between the two organizations. 
  Tang Shubei said: During the discussions, both sides 
reiterated that in principle, airplane hijackers should be 
repatriated without exception. The framework of the agreement 
on repatriating airplane hijackers, reached by the two sides 
during their discussions in Taipei, is good. Both sides also 
agreed that in handling matters relating to agreements, the two 
nongovernmental organizations should follow the principle of 
"stressing the nongovernmental and routine nature," eschew 
politically sensitive issues, and refrain from imposing their 
political demands on each other. This is because the two 
organizations are cooperating amid political differences between 
the two sides. It takes time to solve these political 
differences. Therefore, we should shun politically sensitive 
issues. 
  Tang Shubei said: "Mr. Jiao and I share the feeling that we 
should place on our agenda the economic topics specified in the 
joint agreements of the 'Wang-Gu talks.' We should hold early 
discussions on better protection of Taiwan businessmen's 
investments on the mainland, cross-strait joint development of 
energy and resources, and scientific and technological 
exchanges. With the consent of their leaders, the two 
organizations should also jointly hold a meeting on 
people-to-people economic exchanges at the earliest possible 
date." Regarding economic topics, Jiao Renhe proposed signing 
an agreement on protecting Taiwan businessmen's investments. 
Tang Shubei indicated: By taking account of Taiwan 
businessmen's views and bearing in mind its own actual 
conditions, the mainland has drafted the "Law on Protecting the 
Investments of Taiwan Compatriots" and forwarded it to the 
National People's Congress Standing Committee for examination 
and approval. In accordance with the principle of reciprocity 
and mutual benefit in cross-strait exchanges, we hope that 
Taiwan will lift restrictions banning Taiwan businessmen from 
investing on the mainland, initiate cross-strait cooperation in 
labor services, and ease restrictions on access to Taiwan for 
mainland goods. In the spirit of adopting active measures on 
both sides and protecting Taiwan businessmen's rights and 
interests, we do not exclude the possibility of the two sides 
signing nongovernmental agreements in the future. 
  During the talks, Jiao Renhe noted: The two organizations 
have been in rather close contact over the past year, assisting 
each other in solving quite a few difficulties encountered by 
people on both sides of the Taiwan strait. Regarding the use 
and verification of notarial certificates, the two sides have 
exchanged approximately 20,000 notarial certificates. They have 
exchanged more than 350,000 letters since registered mail 
services were initiated. The scale, range, and level of 
cross-strait cultural and educational exchanges are being 
expanded and upgraded with each passing day; this is a 
heartening sign. The SEF hopes to gradually establish order in 
cross-strait people-to-people exchanges on the basis of mutual 
respect and cooperation. 
  The talks this afternoon lasted for two hours. 
  In the morning, Jiao Renhe and his entourage toured the 
Biyun 
Temple at Xiangshan and paid homage at Dr. Sun Yat-sen's 
cenotaph.

  [Text] Beijing, Feburary 1 (XINHUA) -- Wang Daohan, 
president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan 
Strait (ARATS) of the Chinese Mainland, and Ku Chen-fu, chairman 
of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) of Taiwan, are expected 
to meet again this year. 
  Wang has written Ku a letter inviting him to visit the 
mainland later this spring or early this summer. 
  Tang Shubei, vice executive president of ARATS, on behalf of 
Wang passed the letter on to Chiao Jen-ho, vice-chairman and 
secretary-general of SEF, at the beginning of today's meeting 
between top officials of the two authorized non-government 
intermediary organizations. 
  The first meeting between Wang and Ku was held in Singapore 
on April 27-29 last year, where they reached several agreements 
on a few issues concerning relations between the two sides. 
They also reached the understanding that they will meet once a 
year. 
  Tang said after today's meeting that the time for Ku's visit 
will be scheduled in accordance with SEF's arrangements and at 
Ku's convenience.

  [Text] Mr. Chiao Jen-ho, vice chairman and secretary 
general of Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF], and his 
party arrived in Beijing on 31 January to hold talks with Tang 
Shubei, executive vice president of the Association for 
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS]. (Yin Xin,) an 
editor of this station, wrote a news commentary about the talks: 
"We Hope the Tang-Chiao Talks Will Yield Positive Results." The 
following is the commentary, read by Wen Liang: 
  The Tang Shubei-Chiao Jen-ho talks will be held in Beijing 
1-4 February. The current talks are the fourth ones between 
ARATS and SEF following the successful Wang-Ku talks in 
Singapore in April last year. The current talks are being held 
to discuss the full implementation of the agreements signed at 
the Wang-Ku talks. At the previous three rounds of ARATS-SEF 
talks -- the first was held at the end of August last year in 
Beijing, the second in early October last year in Xiamen, and 
the third in mid-December in Taibei -- the two sides discussed 
issues concerning the repatriation of plane hijackers, civil 
disputes, repatriation of personnel, and the procedures for the 
exchange of visits by ARATS and SEF personnel. At these rounds 
of talks, the two sides also exchanged views on Taiwan 
investors' rights and interests on the mainland and related 
problems, as well as on the exchange of visits by businessmen on 
the two sides of the strait. Some common understanding was 
reached between the two sides on these issues, laying a 
foundation for work consultations between the two sides. 
  According to an agreement reached at the Wang-Ku talks, in 
principle, the executive vice president of ARATS and the vice 
chairman of SEF, or the secretaries general of the two 
organizations, will hold talks every six months on the two 
organizations' work, alternately on one side of the strait or in 
a third place agreed on by the two sides. On 20 November last 
year, ARATS invited Chiao Jen-ho, who just took office as vice 
chairman and secretary general of SEF, to visit Beijing to 
discuss the two organizations' work. At that meeting, the two 
sides also decided that the third work meeting between ARATS and 
SEF would be held in Taibei. The SEF also twice invited Tang 
Shubei to visit Taiwan. Regrettably, Chiao Jen-ho's invitation 
for Tang Shubei to visit Taiwan was not carried out reportedly 
because an agreement was not reached at the Taibei talks. 
Later, ARATS and SEF formally decided that Tang Shubei and 
Chiao Jen-ho would meet in Beijing at the end of January this 
year. However, Taiwan again deliberately created obstacles to 
the meeting, going so far as to say that China and France 
signing a joint communique in which France guarantees that it 
will not sell arms to Taiwan and China's restoring diplomatic 
relations with Lesotho were unfriendly acts of the mainland 
toward Taiwan, and declared that it would reassess the 
Tang-Chiao talks. There was a public outcry in Taiwan over the 
matter, saying Taiwan's such emotional display put people at a 
loss and perplexed the public. Under the pressure of Taiwan's 
public opinion, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Committee finally 
decided that the Tang-Chiao talks would be held in Beijing as 
scheduled. 
  The open contacts and regular meetings to discuss matters of 
interest between the only novgovernment organs authorized by the 
governments of the two sides of the strait are a historically 
important step in the development of cross-strait relations over 
the past 40 years and more. The great significance and 
far-reaching effects of the development have made it a major 
event that people on the two sides of the strait as well as the 
international community have been concerned about. We should 
treasure this hard-won result. To create a cooperative 
atmosphere between the two sides, they should do everything they 
can to reduce all kinds of disturbances in the process of 
communicating with each other. Now that Taiwan's Mainland 
Affairs Committee has agreed to let Chiao Jen-ho go to Beijing 
to meet Tang Shubei as scheduled, it should endeavor to enable 
the talks to yield positive results, with the aim to bring about 
a virtuous cycle of development of the cross-strait relations. 
  There is no need for reticence. Currently some political 
differences still exist between the two sides of the strait, and 
these differences canot be ironed out for the time being. But, 
as long as the two sides work to increase exchanges and contacts 
and as long as high-level responsible persons of the two sides 
maintain regular contacts and communications, dismiss their 
misunderstandings, deepen their mutual understanding, and 
continue to increase their common understanding, we believe that 
Chinese people's own affairs will be settled sooner or later.

education sectors of the two sides took part in the symposium, 
sponsored by the mainland-based Central-South China Engineering 
University, and held here in the provincial capital of central 
China's Hunan Province. 
  Participants discussed some major issues of the construction 
of stock markets, management of securities companies and the 
development of financial futures. 
  They also exchanged opinions about the current situation, 
characteristics and development trends both of Chinese and 
international securities markets. 
  The sponsors said that they held the symposium in a bid to 
sum up the experiences of the mainland and learn from the 
successful experiences of Taiwan in developing the securities 
markets as well as to enhance the understanding, exchange and 
cooperation between the sectors of finance and industry of the 
two sides.

  ["Political Forum": "It Goes Against Legal Principle To 
Advocate 'Two Countries, Two Systems'"] 
  [Text] Last December, 23 Taiwan organizations including the 
Taiwan Presbyterian Church issued a so-called white paper on 
"Peaceful Coexistence of Two Countries, Two Systems." To 
express the so-called "aspirations of the Taiwan people," they 
also wanted to deliver the white paper to members of the 
mainland's Associations for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait 
who went to Taiwan to hold talks with the Taiwan's Straits 
Exchange Foundation. 
  Regarding the two sides of the strait as "two countries," 
the 
"white paper" said: "The two countries must respect each 
other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, refrain from 
invading each other, treat each other as equals, benefit each 
other, and establish normal diplomatic relations," and so on and 
so forth. 
  Obviously, this is a farce instigated by a handful of 
"Taiwan 
independence" elements who have made use of the "nongovernmental 
organizations" to attempt to split the nation under the banner 
of "Taiwan people deciding for themselves." 
  In reply to reporters' questions in Seattle last year, State 
President Jiang Zemin emphatically pointed out: China means the 
PRC, and Taiwan is a province of China. In a white paper 
entitled "The Taiwan Issue and China's Reunification," which was 
published on 31 August last year, the Chinese Government 
systematically and in great detail expounded the Chinese 
Government's principled stand and basic principle and policies 
on the Taiwan issue. It was firmly opposed to any words and 
deeds aimed at splitting state sovereignty and territorial 
integrity. 
  With the founding of the PRC in 1949, the old regime's 
ruling 
power over China as a whole was replaced. There was a 
succession of governments. The succession did not bring about 
any changes in China's territory and Taiwan is still an 
inalienable part of China's sacred territory. 
  The present state of affairs between the two sides of the 
strait constitutes only a split of jurisdiction; the sovereignty 
is still that of a unified state. 
  This fact is not only confirmed by the international law, 
but 
is also a common understanding of the people of the whole China. 
  In ancient China, over the past thousands of years there 
have 
always been three factors in the founding of a state, namely 
"territory, sovereignty, and people." In its history, wars on 
the Chinese territory have created chaos, and there have been 
many regimes. In spite of this, there have never been "several 
Chinas" as a result of "sovereign states not subordinated to one 
another." It is sheer daydreaming on the part of a small handful 
of "Taiwan independence" elements to attempt to found another 
"sovereign state" on the Chinese territory of Taiwan. 
  As a commentary of SHIH-CHIEH LUN-TAN PAO [WORLD TRIBUNE] in 
Taiwan pointed out: To pursue their own selfish interests, 
these people have willfully trampled upon the dignity of the 
"Taiwan people" in the face of the people of the world as if it 
was a joke. They are indeed guilty of the most heinous crimes 
and make all "Taiwan people" feel ashamed! 
  From the overall political and economic situation of the 
world, we can discover that all separated countries belonging to 
a nation will eventually be reunified. 
  The compatriots on both sides of the strait come from the 
same roots and origin. Our spoken and written language, 
customs, and blood relationships can be traced to the same 
origins. There is no reason whatsoever to be separated for a 
long time. Regarding themselves as Chinese, all the people on 
both sides of the strait need only one China. The "Taiwan 
independence" elements, however, do not recognize themselves as 
Chinese, and they vainly try to cut away a piece of Chinese 
territory and found another state. How can the 1.2 billion 
people of China, including Taiwan, sit by idly and remain 
indifferent? 
  The "Taiwan independence" elements vilify the Chinese 
people's consistent stand on safeguarding state reunification 
and territorial integrity as a "distortion of the international 
law and international treaties" and, at the same time, describe 
their attempt to split the country as a "principle of modern 
international law." Their so-called "principle of modern 
international law" means allowing this scum of the nation, out 
of their selfish interests, to willfully cut a piece of land 
from a sovereign state and found another state. 
  Even some democratic countries in the West will never 
tolerate this open act of splitting state sovereignty. Just 
think. It would be strange if some people would not be 
immediately condemned if they attempt to found another country 
in a U.S. state. 
  According to the white paper, which advocates "two 
countries, 
two systems," "it is necessary for Taiwan to join the United 
Nations and other international organizations as soon as 
possible." This is only daydreaming. In 1971 the UN General 
Assembly overwhelmingly passed Resolution 2758, "recognizing the 
PRC as the only legitimate representative of China in UN 
organizations" and stating that, as a part of China, Taiwan is 
not qualified to "join the United Nations." This is something 
known to all. In whatever name Taiwan joins the United Nations, 
it is tantamount to creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one 
Taiwan." This is absolutely out of keeping with the principle 
of China's reunification. 
  Since state reunification is the common aspiration of the 
people on both sides of the strait, the Taiwan independence 
forces on the island should not play with the fire of the 
principled issue of state reunification or they will have only 
themselves to blame.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Gu Shihong (7357 2514 1347)] </F>
  [Text] Haikou, 26 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)-- This 
reporter learned from a conference convened here a few days ago 
that there has been a rapid and sharp growth in Taiwan 
investment in Hainan. 
  Statistics show that by the end of last year, Hainan 
Province 
had approved 902 Taiwan-invested projects worth $961 million in 
total contractual amount, $769 million of which was financed by 
Taiwan capital. Of the 902 Taiwan-invested projects, 397 were 
registered last year, accounting for $482 million in total 
contractual investment, respectively up 21 percent and 32 
percent from a year earlier. Taiwan capital currently accounts 
for 10.2 of Hainan's total foreign investment, second only to 
Hong Kong. 
  According to concerned departments, Taiwan investment in 
Hainan displays the following characteristics: 
  --Gradual increases in investment every year and an 
increasingly faster rate of development. Statistics at the end 
of 1988 show that province-wide there were only 11 approved 
Taiwan-capital enterprises, with $5.94 million in total 
contractual investment. The number was increased annually and by 
1992, the growth rate was such that there were 267 and 418 
percent increases respectively in Taiwan-capital enterprises and 
total contractual investment from the previous year. 
  --A rising proportion for firms exclusively funded by Taiwan 
capital. There are 706 such firms in Hainan's 902 
Taiwan-invested firms, 3.6 times the number of joint-venture and 
cooperation enterprises. 
  --Taiwan businessmen invest more in industrial projects and 
maintain a rational industrial structure. Of these, tourist and 
property investment ranks first, accounting for about half of 
Taiwan investment, while industrial and agricultural projects 
account for 32 and 10 percent respectively. Together they 
account for over 90 percent. 
  Officials at the Hainan Provincial Taiwan Affairs Office 
said 
the province will increase its efforts to attract Taiwan capital 
and investment, work vigorously to get Taiwan businesses to 
launch a few large-scale projects in the agricultural, tourist, 
high-tech, and mining sectors, encourage one or two 
Taiwan-capital banks or non-financial [fei jin rong 7236 6855 
5816] institutions to set up their base in Hainan, and call a 
"Seminar on Hainan-Taiwan Economic and Financial Development" 
this March.

  [Text] A three-day provincial political and legal affairs 
work conference wound up in Xining yesterday afternoon. 
  Comrades in charge of political and legal affairs work from 
across the province conscientiously studied a series of 
important instructions issued by a number of central leaders 
with regard to maintaining political stability and social order; 
analyzed in an in-depth manner the province's present political 
and legal affairs work on the basis of summing up last year's 
work; and laid down the tasks for 1994 in light of Qinghai's 
realities. 
  Provincial party committee Secretary Yin Kesheng delivered a 
speech at the closing session in which he stated: Over the past 
year, political and legal affairs workers across the province 
have made strenuous efforts and scored noticeable achievements. 
We are going to accomplish more onerous tasks in 1994. Given 
the fact that the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee adopted the "Decision on Several Questions on Building 
a Socialist Market Economic Structure," we are bound to witness 
speedier reform and construction in 1994. We are facing an 
excellent opportunity for faster development on the one hand and 
a rigorous test and challenge on the other. In order to narrow 
the gap between Qinghai and the rest of the country and more 
successfully push ahead with reform and construction, we should 
comprehensively step up political and legal affairs work and 
strive to maintain social stability. 
  Speaking of Qinghai's political and legal affairs work in 
1994, Comrade Yin Kesheng noted: We should understand more 
clearly the importance of political and legal affairs work in 
the new situation; unswervingly adhere to the principle of 
firmly grasping two types work at the same time; and make every 
possible endeavor to maintain provincewide stability. To this 
end, Yin Kesheng added, efforts should be made to strengthen 
leadership; conduct work in a down-to-earth manner; and strive 
to open up new vistas for the province's political and legal 
affairs work in 1994. First and foremost, the provincial 
political and legal affairs committee should strengthen 
leadership over all political and legal affairs departments 
across the province; strengthen coordination among and 
supervision of public security, procuratorial, and judicial 
organs at all levels; and work hard to open up new vistas for 
the province's political and legal affairs work. Second, party 
committees at all levels across the province should strengthen 
overall leadership over political and legal affairs work while 
governments at all levels should render unreserved support to 
political and legal affairs work with a view to further pushing 
ahead with the province's political and legal affairs work in 
1994. 
  Comrade Yin Kesheng noted: The political and legal affairs 
workers in Qinghai are loyal to the party and the people. Over 
the past many years they have made indelible contributions to 
Qinghai's stability and development. Nevertheless, problems 
have also been discovered within the ranks of political and 
legal affairs workers. In view of this situation, it is 
necessary to make every possible endeavor to turn the province's 
contingent of political and legal affairs workers into a 
contingent that is politically reliable, professionally 
competent, and capable of fighting tough battles and 
withstanding all tests and is supported and cherished by the 
broad masses of the people across the province. 
  Comrade Yin Kesheng maintained: It would be impossible to 
successfully further political and legal affairs work in the 
absence of the party and government's leadership and support. 
Thus, party committees and governments at all levels in Qinghai 
should continue, as always, to attach great importance to and 
support political and legal affairs work; constantly guide 
political and legal affairs work with correct principles and 
policies; assist political and legal affairs departments to 
independently investigate and handle cases in accordance with 
the law as well as strictly enforcing the law under the guidance 
of the party's basic line; show concern for and help political 
and legal affairs departments tackle problems in work; and 
assist public security, procuratorial, and judicial organs in 
updating technological equipment and improving working 
conditions. 
  Comrade Yin Kesheng stated: The whole society is undoubtedly 
duty-bound to step up political and legal affairs work and 
improve social order. All areas, departments, trades, and 
professions as well as all social strata should give support to 
and enhance cooperation with political and legal affairs 
departments and join them in successfully strengthening 
management of comprehensive social order. All units, urban 
district offices, and neighborhood committes, as well as rural 
and pastoral villages and townships across the province, should 
make continued efforts to establish and perfect a responsibility 
system aimed at stepping up comprehensive social order 
management with a view to creating an overall social atmosphere 
for maintaining social order and improving the general social 
mood, wherein all bad deeds and people will be invariably 
opposed, thereby: Exerting more social pressure on all types of 
criminals; improving social order across the province in a 
comprehensive way; and lowering the province's crime rate to a 
minimum. 
  Chen Yanqin, Tang Zhengren, and Doba, provincial party 
committee standing committee members; Huanjue Cenam, provincial 
people's congress standing committee chairman; provincial Vice 
Governor La Bingli; and other comrades also attended the closing 
session. 
  Lu Haiping, provincial political and legal affairs committee 
deputy secretary, made a summing-up speech at the closing 
session.

  [Excerpts] The provincial government held an economic and 
foreign trade work meeting on 25 January. Governor Tian 
Chengping and Vice Governor Wang Hanmin attended and the 
addressed the meeting. 
  Wang Hanmin stressed: In this year's foreign trade and 
economic relations, we should further deepen reform and firmly 
abide by the line of macro-foreign trade. This is the 
fundamental way to increase vitality in foreign trade 
enterprises. We should unify our policies, carry out operations 
openly, engage in fair competition, assume sole responsibility 
for profits and losses, combine economy with foreign trade, and 
seek new ways of reform in light of our specific conditions. We 
should build export commodity bases in a planned way in 
accordance with international market demands, introduce 
conglomeration, jointly develop production by allowing others to 
buy shares, and form enterprise groups. [passage omitted] 
  Wang Hanmin pointed out: This year, we should continue to 
carry out the strategy of market diversification and triumphing 
over others by means of good quality. In the course of 
consolidating and developing the existing network and foreign 
trade relations, foreign trade and export enterprises in the 
province should also explore markets in developing countries so 
that we will have trade partners all over big continents. In 
the meantime, all localities and departments should regard 
foreign economic relations and foreign capital as a basis for 
foreign trade development. [passage omitted] 
  Governor Tian Chengping hoped that other departments in the 
province would actively cooperate with foreign trade departments 
in promoting foreign economic relations and trade.

  [Text] Qinghai has scored noticeable anticorruption 
results since last September when various areas and units across 
the province started conscientiously relaying and implementing 
the spirit of the anticorruption instructions given by the CPC 
Central Committee and the Qinghai Provincial CPC Committee, 
mobilizing and guiding the broad masses of people at all levels 
across the province to combat corruption, and creating a strong 
anticorruption momentum in the whole province with the result 
that the broad masses of people and cadres in Qinghai now have 
enhanced confidence in the on-going anticorruption struggle. 
  Statistics shows that the provincial discipline inspection 
commission and supervision department received reports on some 
679 corruption cases from the masses in the period between late 
August and late November last year. Some 84.8 percent of the 
province's cadres at provincial department or bureau level and 
some 97 percent of the province's cadres at county or provincial 
department section level conducted anticorruption 
self-examination in the same period with the result that some 
cadres voluntarily handed over credit cards, coupons, and 
souvenirs given to them as gifts, admitted such past wrongdoings 
as enjoying above-standard reception and free meals during 
inspection tours of grass-roots units, accepting special local 
products given by grass-roots cadres on Lunar New Year Festival, 
and so on, and put forth measures of straightening out those 
malpractices. Their correct approach was appreciated by the 
broad masses of cadres and people. 
  Qinghai's anticorruption success is also proven by the fact 
that the province has made much headway in investigating and 
handling corruption cases. According to incomplete statistics, 
in 1993, discipline inspection and supervision departments in 
the province placed on file for investigation and prosecution 
some 514 corruption cases, of which some 402 cases were wound 
up, with the result that a total of 154 party members who had 
violated discipline were penalized, of whom 64 were expelled 
from the party. One was a cadre at provincial department level 
and 13 were cadres at county or provincial department section 
level. A total of 59 cadres were disciplined in accordance with 
the relevant administrative rules, of whom five were cadres at 
county or provincial department section level. Moreover, the 
province also investigated and straightened out those 
malpractices that had caused strong resentment among the masses 
with the result that some 601 economic entities run by party or 
government organs at the county level were screened, of which 22 
were abolished or ordered to suspend operation, six were ordered 
to become enterprises, and 11 were ordered to be leased to other 
units. The provincial authorities are presently studying ways 
and means of severing ties between those remaining economic 
entities on the one hand and the party or government organs at 
county or provincial department section levels on the other.

  [Text] A three-day national security work meeting 
concluded yesterday. Provincial party Deputy Secretary Zhi 
Yiming, Vice Govenor Xu Shanlin, and leaders from the Ministry 
of State Security attended and addressed the meeting. Zhang 
Yongkui, chief of the Shaanxi Provincial State Security 
Department, made a work report. 
  The meeting pointed out: Since the introduction of reform 
and opening up in Shaanxi, the situation has developed very 
fast. But the better the situation, the more we should heighten 
our vigilance. At present, the world is not quite peaceful, 
factors causing instability are increasing, and spy and 
intelligence organizations as well as some hostile forces 
outside the borders keep carrying out sabotage activities. The 
province has a heavy task of defending state security. Viewed 
from the angle of opposing peaceful evolution and preserving the 
country's prolonged stability and tranquility, we must correctly 
understand the importance of strengthening state security, 
remain sober-minded and maintain vigilance against enemy 
movements on the concealed front, and strengthen the province's 
state security. 
  The meeting requested all offices, mass organizations, 
enterprises, and institutions to frequently carry out education 
on state security among their personnel, to solidly cultivate 
the mentality of everyone being responsible for state security, 
to help state security institutions with their work, and to 
crack down on all kinds of crimes damaging state security to 
ensure the smooth carrying out of reform, opening up, and 
economic construction.

  [Text] The Sixth Enlarged Plenary Session of the Fourth 
Xinjiang Regional CPC Committee successfully ended in Urumqi 
yesterday afternoon. [Video shows closeup of Abulaiti 
Amudurexiti] Abulaiti Amudurexiti, deputy secretary of the 
regional party committee and acting chairman of the autonomous 
region, presided over yesterday's meeting. 
  Leading comrades including Song Hanliang, Zhang Fusen, Jin 
Yunhui, Wang Liquan, Keyum Bawudun, Guo Gang, Zhou Shengtao, 
Heiliqiemu Silamu, Pan Zhaomin, and (Li Fengzi) attended the 
plenary meeting. [Video shows closeups of leaders mentioned] 
  The meeting adopted the regional party committee's decision 
on seriously implementing the guidelines of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC National Congress, accelerating reform 
and opening up, and promoting Xinjiang's economic development in 
a rapid and efficient way; and it adopted the resolution on the 
work report of the Advisory Committee of Xinjiang Uygur 
Autonomous Region. 
  Song Hanliang, secretary of the regional party committee, 
made a summing up speech. He emphatically pointed out: To 
further promote Xinjiang's reform and development, the most 
crucial thing is to emancipate our minds and seek truth from 
facts. In the minds of some of our comrades, the problem of 
being socialist or capitalist has not been fundamentally solved. 
The old ideology of planned economy still restrains the minds 
of some of our comrades. The traditional oasis economy of 
seeking self-sufficiency has been firmly established in the 
minds of people. It has generated deep-rooted ideas of closed 
economy, self-satisfaction, and conservatism. When discussing 
reform, some comrades often stressed special conditions in the 
region and warned against taking big strides. They wanted to do 
things slowly and hoped to receive more special consideration. 
This kind of backward ideology has adversely influenced our 
work. 
  Song Hanling said: Without deepening the reform and changing 
our ideology, we will not be able to achieve the goal of 
enabling the people to lead a fairly comfortable life. In the 
course of emancipating our minds, leading cadres at various 
levels must stand at the forefront and set examples for others. 
We should conscientiously study Volume 3 of the Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping, arm the minds of cadres of various 
nationalities with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, and plunge ourselves 
into the great practice of reform and construction. 
  Song Hanling said: Xinjiang should have a sense of urgency 
in promoting development with high speed and high efficiency. 
We must now pay particular attention to the following points: 
  1. We should accelerate adjustment of the industrial 
structure and raise the overall efficiency of the national 
economy. 
  2. We should improve the allocation of productive forces and 
give favorable consideration to both special areas and special 
industries. 
  3. We should break away from the structure of single 
ownership and vigorously develop private economy. 
  4. We should change the operational mechanism of and 
invigorate state-owned enterprises. 
  5. We should successfully complete construction of the 
international passageway in the Northwest and further open up to 
the outside world. 
  Song Hanling said: Adhering to the policy of grasping two 
links [no further elaboration; the term "grasping two links" was 
explained in detail in Jiang Zemin's report to the 14th CPC 
National Congress] simultaneously and attaching equal importance 
to both are basic requirements for building socialism and are 
integral components of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. We must 
persist in grasping the two links in our actual work. 
  On the issue of maintaining social and political stability, 
Song Hanling pointed out: First, we must correctly handle the 
relationship between stability and development. Second, we 
should foster the idea of making efforts over a long period and 
heighten our consciousness regarding the work of maintaining 
stability. Third, leading cadres at various levels should oppose 
national splittism with a clear-cut stand. Fourth, we should 
exert all our efforts to grasp the work of maintaining 
stability. Fifth, we should firmly trust and rely on the masses 
of various nationalities. 
  Song Hanling emphatically pointed out: To realize the 
strategic goals set by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
National Congress and the tasks put forward by the current 
meeting, to accelerate reform and opening up and to promote 
Xinjiang's rapid and efficient economic development, the key 
lies in strengthening and improving the party's leadership and, 
in particular, strengthening party leadership over economic work. 
  Members of party committees at various levels must spend 
more 
time in study and less time in social activities, undertake more 
investigation and study and reduce their subjectivism, do more 
practical things and limit empty speech, concentrate their 
efforts on effectively resolving contradictions and problems 
arising in the course of reform and development, and ensure the 
true implementation of various principles and policies of the 
party Central Committee and the autonomous region.

  [Text] In a written statement he presented to the sixth 
enlarged plenary session of the Sixth Xinjiang Regional Party 
Committee [date not given], Tomur Dawamat, deputy secretary of 
the Xinjiang Autonomous Region Party Committee, expressed his 
views on achieving greater solidarity and stability in Xinjiang. 
  He pointed out: Speeding up economic development is a basic 
task of ethnic affairs during the new period. Experiences prove 
that differences among people of various nationalities and 
problems in minority areas must eventually be resolved through 
economic development. When the economy has developed, the 
strengths of the socialist system can be brought into full play, 
people of all nationalities will love the CPC and the motherland 
even more, and they will become even more aware of the need to 
safeguard the unification of our motherland and the solidarity 
among people of all nationalities. 
  He pointed out: People of all nationalities should respect, 
trust, support, emulate, and understand each other. We should 
breathe the same breath, and share the same destiny; and our 
hearts should be linked. Only by so doing can our cause prosper 
and become invincible. To achieve solidarity among people of 
all nationalities, the key lies in the solidarity among cadres, 
especially leading cadres, at all levels. We must rally and 
count on cadres and the masses at all levels to wage a 
justifiable fight against the national separatists' 
conspiracies, giving full scope to the role of people's 
dictatorship. For hostile elements engaging in separatist 
activities, in promoting unrest [gao dong luan], and in opposing 
the party and socialism, we must exercise dictatorship on them. 
By no means should we be lenient on them.

<F P=106> [By Adhuresidi (7093 0008 6757 3583 6007 2251), deputy chief </F>
of Xinjiang Public Security Department: "Stability Must 
Overwhelm Everything"] 
  [Text] An important concept in volume three of the 
"Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" is "stability stands above all 
else." To adhere to the party basic line for 100 years without 
wavering, it is imperative to consolidate and develop the 
political situation of unity and stability. Without political 
stability, reform, opening up, and economic construction would 
all be out of the question. Furthermore, the results already 
gained would also be lost. To consolidate and develop the 
stable political situation is not only the objective need of 
social and economic development but the aspiration and basic 
interest of Chinese people of all nationalities. 
  Xinjiang is located on the motherland's northwestern 
frontier, sharing its border, which stretches some 4,000 km, 
with eight neighboring countries. With the deepening of reform 
and the expansion of opening up, Xinjiang's economy has become 
increasingly prosperous with each passing day and it has become 
an important part of the Eurasian continental bridge. However, 
with the tremendous changes in Eastern Europe in recent years, 
the ambition of hostile elements from outside our borders in 
their attempt to separate Xinjiang has expanded with each 
passing day. Those separatist forces openly clamor: "Oppose 
socialism" and "religion stands before Marxism-Leninism," in an 
attempt to separate the motherland and Xinjiang and to sabotage 
nationality solidarity. Consequently, their reactionary nature 
has been fully revealed. 
  This being the case, it is imperative for us to further 
strengthen the struggle against separatism, sternly crack down 
on various criminal activities, and adhere to doing two types of 
work simultaneously, attaching equal importance to both. We 
must adhere to the four cardinal principles, resolutely 
eliminate all factors which lead to confusion, and even turmoil, 
to safeguard social stability and ensure the further in-depth 
development of socialist economic construction. The stability 
of the political situation is the prerequisite for rapid 
economic growth. In turn, economic prosperity will inevitably 
promote social stability.

  [Text] Urumqi, February 1 (XINHUA) -- Northwest China's 
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region will make greater efforts to 
boost tourism this year. 
  Local officials said that they hoped for a 12 percent growth 
in both the number of tourists and earnings from tourism 
services. 
  To realize this target the autonomous region will launch at 
least three major tourism routes under the national program of 
"1994 Cultural Relics and Historic Sites Tours," and start some 
new tourism programs with special features, such as desert 
expedition and rafting on rivers addition to eight international 
tourism and trade fairs. 
  Statistics show that Xinjiang received about 240,000 
overseas 
tourists and earned 40.02 million U.S. dollars from relevant 
services last year. 
  The famous "Silk Road," which used to serve as a major 
channel for conducting exchanges between China and countries in 
western Asia and Europe, is in the region. 
  The opening of 14 Chinese border cities has presented 
Xinjiang with more opportunities for developing tourism, said 
the officials. 
  Xinjiang's strategy is also to combine tourism with trade. 
From July 1991 to the present, nearly 300,000 people from 
Pakistan, Mongolia and the Commonwealth of Independent States 
came to Xinjiang on shopping tours.

<F P=106> [Article by Liu Weiping of Urumqi's First Secondary School </F>
of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps] 
  [Text] Over the last few years, holding back teachers' 
wages has been very common, and this also has been the case in 
Xinjiang. According to a friend of mine who works at a farm of 
the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, they have not 
received their wages for more than 10 months, making their lives 
very difficult. Although the government has called for issuing 
overdue wages before New Year's day, many localities have not or 
have not thoroughly solved the problem. Education is the 
underlying requirement for building the country and teachers are 
the key to promoting education. To promote education, first we 
should assure teachers of the basic needs for their daily lives 
and ensure that they can concentrate on their work. Without 
feeding a horse, how can you ask it to run? With an empty 
stomach, how can a teacher teach? We have been shouting for 
enhancing teachers status but little has really been done. I 
feel sad. 
  With the Spring Festival around the corner, we earnestly 
hope 
the "Teachers Law" will be conscientiously carried out and 
leaders at all levels will regard issuing teachers overdue pay 
as an important matter so that teachers can enjoy a happy and 
prosperous Spring Festival.

<F P=106> [By reporter Liu Li (0491 0500): "He Zhukang Holds Talks </F>
With Tax Bureau Cadres"] 
  [Text] In 1993, the provincial tax bureau persistently 
handled tax affairs according to laws, intensified the 
management of tax revenues, positively cultivated tax resources, 
supported economic development, and made gratifying 
achievements. As a result, the tax revenues of the province 
increased by a big margin. On the afternoon of 11 January, He 
Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party committee, went to 
the provincial tax bureau to extend greetings to the bureau and 
also stated that in the new year, the bureau should make 
consistent efforts to achieve the reform of the tax system, make 
efforts to promote production and increase revenues, and strive 
to make greater achievements. 
  At the meeting hall of the provincial tax bureau, Comrade He 
Zhukang heard the work report made by the responsible comrade of 
the provincial tax bureau and also held talks with some tax 
cadres. 
  In the past year, the tax organs at various levels and the 
broad masses of tax cadres across the province conscientiously 
implemented the guidelines of the 14th party congress and the 
sixth provincial party congress, persistently administered the 
tax affairs according to laws, strengthened the management of 
tax collection, vigorously organized tax collection, positively 
promoted production to increase revenues, realistically 
strengthened the construction of the cadres contingents, and 
better accomplished various tax revenue tasks. According to 
statistics, the provincial tax department collected and handed 
over to the state treasury 7.168 billion yuan of local-level 
industrial and commercial taxes, showing an increase of 43.4 
percent over the previous year and overfulfilling the fiscal 
target of elevating the tax collection work to a new height. 
The growth rate had not been seen in the past few years. The 
tax management forms and the tax inspection methods were 
improved. The scale of experiment with the management of tax 
affairs on a commissioned basis was expanded. All this helped 
promote the setup of the pattern for collection and management 
of taxes suitable to the socialist market economic system. We 
made noticeable achievements in consolidating the tax revenue 
order. The overall front has further improved its practice and 
made achievements in especially eliminating the unhealthy trends. 
  During the talks, the participants set forth opinions and 
suggestions on installing organs, collecting and managing tax 
revenues, and promoting production to increase revenues 
following the implementation of the new tax system and on the 
new problems that will possibly emerge. 
  Comrade He Zhukang wrote down what he was told. After 
hearing their speeches, he pleasantly said: Our province's tax 
revenue work has been good. The tax revenues steadily 
increased. Particularly in 1993, the tax revenues increased by 
a big margin thanks to the efforts made by the broad masses of 
the tax affairs workers. On the one hand, the tax department 
has vigorously increased its revenues; and on the other, it has 
positively supported the local economic development. So, it has 
made great contributions. It also stands in the forefront of 
deepening reform and correcting the unhealthy trends within 
trades. It has made many successful explorations and 
accumulated many typical experiences. The provincial party 
committee and the provincial government have constantly been 
satisfied with the tax revenue work. On behalf of the 
provincial party committee and the provincial government, I 
came here today in order to extend cordial regards and heartfelt 
thanks to you and also ask you to pass our regards and thanks to 
the broad masses of tax workers across the province. 
  Comrade He Zhukang said: The 1994 reform and tax tasks are 
very heavy. First, we should grasp revenues. This is of 
extreme importance to ensure a sustained and fast economic 
development and the implementation of a series of new reform 
measures. Second, we should achieve the reform of the tax 
system and ensure the implementation of the new tax system. We 
should strengthen study and propaganda to have the tax workers, 
the personages of all social circles, and the broad masses of 
the people to accurately understand and support this reform. We 
have to do a lot of work to implement the new tax system and to 
exert great efforts to do our work well from the beginning of 
the year. The next-step work will easily be done when we 
achieve the work of the first year. Otherwise, there will be 
more difficulties. We should conscientiously conduct 
investigations and study when coming across with the problems in 
the course of implementing the new tax system and explore 
methods for solving the problems cropping up in the course of 
practice. Simultaneously, we should timely report to the higher 
levels and ask their instructions so as to reasonably solve 
problems. The reform of the tax system is a matter relating to 
not only the tax departments but also the party committees and 
governments at various levels. Therefore, the party committees 
and governments at various levels should go all out to support 
the reform of the tax system to ensure the smooth progress of 
this reform. 
  Comrade He Zhukang stressed: As a key economic lever, the 
tax collection work plays a better role in macroeconomic 
regulation and control. Therefore, strengthening the 
macroeconomic regulation and control plays a proper role in 
setting up the socialist market economic system. Great changes 
will take place after implementing the new tax system. Some 
problems have not been expected. Particularly, we should 
urgently study methods to solve the problems relating to the 
existence and development of a large number of town and township 
enterprises and small-scale tax payers. Some of the existing 
macroeconomic regulation and control methods are not suitable 
any more. Thus, the tax departments are required to become a 
new actor as soon as possible, readjust its work ideology, 
boldly explore ways and methods for macroeconomic regulation and 
control under the new system, and strive to promote a sound 
development of the economy. 
  Comrade He Zhukang said: After the reform of the tax system, 
the tax organ should be divided into two bureaus, such as state 
tax bureau and local tax bureau. However, their goal still 
remains unchanged. That is, they should better promote the 
development of reform and the economy. Both state and local tax 
bureaus are very important. We should foster the idea of 
"taking the whole country into account." We should consult and 
coordinate with one another if there are problems, proceed from 
the overall situation, and make concerted efforts to achieve the 
tax revenue work. 
  Comrade He Zhukang concluded: Today, the participants set 
forth many good opinions and suggestions on the tax revenue 
work. From now on, we hope that you will be able to put 
forward, at any time, your own opinions and suggestions on the 
work of the provincial party committee and the provincial 
government and on the local economic development. The party 
committees and governments at various levels should pay high 
attention to your opinions and suggestions to ceaselessly 
improve their work. 
  Present at the talks were responsible comrades of the 
relevant departments of the provincial party committee and the 
provincial government.

  [Text] Beijing, February 1 (XINHUA) -- Vice-Premier Li 
Lanqing, on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party Central 
Committee and State Council, today extended spring festival 
greetings to returned students, Chinese students studying abroad 
and relatives of these students. 
  Addressing a party held in the Great Hall of the People, Li 
said that over the past 15 years, China has sent 200,000 
students to study in other countries and 70,000 of them have 
returned. 
  The leader praised returned students for their outstanding 
contributions to reforms, opening up and China's modernization 
drive. 
  "The present international and domestic situations are very 
favorable to China's modernization drive," said Li, who is also 
a member of the Political Bureau of the party Central Committee. 
  By deepening reforms, opening wider to the outside world, 
promoting economic growth and maintaining stability, China is 
trying to create a socialist market economy and step up the 
development of social productive forces, he told the party, 
sponsored by the State Education Commission. 
  According to the vice-premier, to achieve these goals, it is 
imperative to continue opening wider to the rest of the world, 
boldly draw on all useful experience over the world and score 
achievements in the high-tech field. 
  In all these areas, returned students shoulder a "major and 
glorious" task because of their expertise and knowledge, and 
should make their due contributions, he told the party, attended 
by 6,000 people. 
  The leader also praised those still studying abroad for 
loving the motherland and supporting China's economic 
construction and development. He invited more such students to 
return home and work for the motherland. 
  He urged governments and departments at all levels, as well 
colleges and universities, to provide fine working and living 
conditions for returned students so that they will be able to 
play a major role in the reform, opening up and the 
modernization drive. 
  Hu Jintao, a Standing Committee member of the Political 
Bureau of the party Central Committee, attended the party. 
  Before the party began, Hu Jintao and Li Lanqing met with 20 
representatives of returned students.

  [Text] Beijing, February 1 (XINHUA) -- Hu Jintao, a top 
Chinese Communist Party leader, said today that retired 
officials of the party and government still play a significant 
role in helping China's economy to expand, promoting the reform 
and opening drive and maintaining social stability. 
  Addressing a reception in the Great Hall of the People, Hu, 
on behalf of the party Central Committee and the State Council, 
extended Spring Festival greetings to retired officials 
throughout the country. 
  Hu, a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of 
the party Central Committee, said that 1994 is a year "crucial" 
to the success of China's reform, opening up and modernization 
drive. 
  To accomplish this year's reforms and economic construction 
tasks, it is imperative to follow the party's ideological line 
of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts and the 
party's work line of relying on the masses, Hu told the 2,000 in 
attendance. 
  The reception was sponsored jointly by the Propaganda 
Department of the party Central Committee, the General Political 
Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the 
Beijing Municipal Party Committee. 
  Hu, who is also a member of the Secretariat of the party 
Central Committee, said that by relying on and forging close 
ties with the people, and mobilizing all positive factors in 
society, "we will certainly be able to surmount all difficulties 
on our road forward." 
  The leader praised retired officials for their historic 
contributions toward victory in the new democratic revolution, 
the establishment of the socialist system, the development of 
socialism, and the promotion of reform, opening up, 
modernization and China's prosperity. 
  He also called on them to continue supporting various 
undertakings of the reform and construction and helping younger 
officials to assume positions of greater responsibility. 
  According to Hu, China now has more than seven million 
retired party and government officials. Party committees and 
government bodies at all levels must strengthen their leadership 
of work among these officials, he noted. 
  He pledged to establish and perfect a social insurance 
system 
for retired officials in the course of instituting new reform 
measures. 
  He also stressed the importance of taking proper measures to 
help these officials overcome the difficulties in their 
livelihood, so that they will be able to enjoy their later years.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Whole Party Must Attach Importance to </F>
Propaganda and Ideological Work"] 
  [Text] The national conference on propaganda and 
ideological work has closed triumphantly. All localities are 
now conveying and implementing the guidelines laid down by the 
conference. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as 
well as the guidance of the basic party line, the conference 
studied and planned how to intensify and improve propaganda and 
ideological work under the new situation, following the 
guidelines laid down by the 14th National Party Congress and its 
third plenary session, as well as the principle that we must be 
firm in carrying out ideological and political work while 
proceeding with economic construction and opening up to the 
outside world. Thanks to the CPC Central Committee's kind 
attention and its direct leadership as well as the efforts 
exerted by comrades attending the conference, the conference 
became a meeting that has enabled the participants to understand 
the overall requirement, achieve a consensus of views, and 
clearly understand their missions; it was a democratic, united, 
efficient, and pragmatic meeting in which the participants 
discussed issues harmoniously and freely; and it was a meeting 
which has strengthened our confidence and encouraged us to press 
forward with high fighting morale. The historic meeting 
certainly will play a major role in ensuring and expediting the 
victorious development of the cause of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. 
  Comrades Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and Zhu Rongji gave important 
speeches at the conference. In his speech, Comrade Jiang Zemin 
expounded on the important significance of propaganda and 
ideological work during the new period and set the fundamental 
guidance and major missions for propaganda and ideological work. 
Pointing out that the party must intensify and improve its 
leadership over propaganda and ideological work, he placed 
earnest hopes on comrades working on the propaganda and 
ideological front. The speech is a programmatic document with 
important guiding significance for the party's propaganda and 
ideological work during the new period. Party committees and 
departments in charge of propaganda and ideological work at all 
levels must earnestly study and understand the document, achieve 
a greater concensus of views, obey the overall requirement, 
emancipate their minds, seek truth from facts, heighten their 
morale, press forward, and earnestly carry out the guidelines 
and assignments in accordance with the Central Committee's 
requirements. 
  The propaganda and ideological front is an important front 
during our socialist modernization drive. The CPC always 
attaches great importance to propaganda and ideological work. 
Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has time and again stressed: 
"We must place ideological and political work in a very 
important position and accomplish it earnestly, and we must not 
slacken our efforts in this regard." He added: "All work on 
the ideological front must be strengthened." During the past two 
years, guided and encouraged by the important speeches which 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping gave in southern China and by the 
guidelines of the 14th National Party Congress, China's reform, 
opening up, and socialist modernization drive have entered a new 
stage imbued with life and vitality. The recent Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee made an overall and 
systematic planning for building a socialist market economic 
system, and the national economic conference has also provided 
specific plans for achieving a sustained, fast, and healthy 
national economic development. The overall requirement set for 
the party is to seize the opportunity to deepen reform, open 
wider to the outside world, expedite development, and maintain 
stability. The new situation has presented a series of new 
assignments, new issues, and new requirements for propaganda and 
ideological work. Historical experiences tell us that the 
deeper our reform and the faster our development, the more 
necessary it is for us to intensify and improve propaganda and 
ideological work and to intensify our socialist spiritual 
construction. While the majority of comrades in our party are 
attaching importance to propaganda and ideological work and are 
quite firm in attending to this assignment, some comrades do not 
have sufficient understanding of the importance of intensifying 
propaganda and ideological work as well as spiritual 
construction. The problem of "being tough on the one hand and 
soft on the other" still exists in one way or the other when 
they do their work. During the course of spiritual 
construction, there are still noteworthy problems regarding 
party conduct and the general mood of society. This situation 
must be corrected immediately. To successfully accomplish their 
propaganda and ideological work, our comrades must understand 
the importance of propaganda and ideological work from the 
overall strategic requirement of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, understand the urgency of propaganda and 
ideological work from the historical assignment of deepening 
reform and expediting development, and understand the 
formidability of propaganda and ideological work from the real 
need of socialist spiritual construction. 
  Doing a good job in propaganda and ideological work is not 
just a task of propaganda and ideological departments and 
workers of those departments, but is the task of the whole 
party, especially the party's leading organs at various levels. 
For a long time, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has raised the call that 
the party's leading organs, in addition to grasping principles 
and policies and making decisions on the employment of important 
cadres, should devote their main efforts in ideological and 
political work. The principal responsible comrades of party 
committees at various levels should strive to overcome the 
thinking of considering propaganda and ideological work as a 
"soft task." They should firmly implement the principle of 
"grasping both material progress and ideological and cultural 
progress and placing equal emphasis on both," put propaganda and 
ideological work and the building of spiritual civilization on 
the party committee's important daily agenda, and effectively 
strengthen and improve their leadership over propaganda and 
ideological work. It is necessary to pay attention to studying 
and mastering the law of propaganda and ideological work, be 
good at closely linking propaganda and ideological work with 
economic work and other tasks, and use propaganda and 
ideological work to promote and lead economic construction and 
other work. We should constantly go into the midst of the 
propaganda and ideological front to investigate and study, sum 
up experiences, put forward methods, solve problems, show more 
concern, and give more support and help to propaganda and 
ideological work. From now on, in evaluating the work of 
leading cadres and leading groups, we should consider whether 
they attach importance to propaganda and ideological work and 
whether they are good at leading propaganda and ideological work 
as an important part of judging their political quality and 
leadership level. We should consider the results of propaganda 
and ideological work and of the building of spiritual 
civilization as an important part in evaluating the work of an 
area, a department, and a unit. 
  To strengthen propaganda and ideological work, we should 
have 
a contingent of workers armed with the theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics -- Marxism in 
contemporary China [dong dai zhong guo di ma ke si zhu yi 3981 
0108 0022 0948 4104 7456 0344 1835 0031 5030] -- who are loyal 
to the cause of the party and the people, and competent 
politically and professionally with good workstyle. We now have 
a several million-strong team consisting of theoretical, news, 
publication, and literary and art workers, and grass-roots 
propaganda and ideology workers, and this is a great army which 
is extremely valuable in promoting the construction of the two 
civilizations. The party and the people have great expectations 
for this team. Propaganda and ideology work is a very important 
and glorious job, but also a fairly arduous and rather 
painstaking job. This then requires our propaganda and ideology 
workers to have the spirit of making selfless contributions and 
arduous struggle. Perhaps our work will not bring material 
benefits to individuals, but it will bring benefit to the 
motherland and people; perhaps our names will not be among the 
list of names of heroes of the times, but our contributions will 
be compiled into the splendid annals of the great undertakings 
of hundreds of millions of people. Marx said: "If we choose a 
profession which could provide the most material benefits to 
mankind through our labor, then, the heavy burden will not 
overwhelm us, because we are giving our life for the people; 
what we feel then will not be pitiful, limited, and selfish 
delight, for our happiness will belong to thousands of millions 
of people....." This should become a motto for each of us 
propaganda and ideology workers. Our party, government, and 
people have always had great confidence in and lent vigorous 
support to propaganda and ideology workers, and the propaganda 
and ideology workers should be proud of that, increase their 
sense of honor and responsibility, justify the great trust 
placed in them by the party and people, and unceasingly create 
new outstanding achievements. 
  In the glorious undertakings of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, propaganda and ideologicial work is the 
scaffold for constructing the large building of the two 
civilizations, the boost motor for the ship of reform and 
opening up to cleave the waves and move forward, and the bugle 
for advancing for the hundreds of millions in the construction 
army to scale a new height. At the beginning of the new year, 
the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core 
convened a national propaganda and ideology work meeting, and 
this greatly inspires and spurs on comrades of the whole party, 
especially all comrades on the propaganda and ideology front. 
We must seize opportunities, do solid work, and work hard to 
bring propaganda and ideology work to a new level so as to arm 
people with scientific theory, to guide people with correct 
public opinion, to mould people with a lofty spirit, to inspire 
people with works of excellence, and to make new contributions 
that win us new victory in the undertaking of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics.

one after another like shooting stars. 
  And certain news items even found their way into 
Zhongnanhai, 
causing the hearts of supreme CPC leaders to beat faster. 
  The latest astounding news was that Yang Shangkun was 
attacked in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone. 
  Yang flew to Shenzhen from Beijing 8 January. According to 
the joint arrangements by the CPC Central Committee General 
Office, the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, and the Yang 
Shangkun Office, Yang was to spend one week in Shenzhen. 
Beginning 10 January, he was scheduled to visit two fairly 
large foreign-funded joint-venture enterprises; meet with 
scientific and technological personnel and financial experts in 
Shenzhen as well as elderly Shenzhen citizens; visit the animal 
park and the Splendid China miniature scenic spots; attend an 
organization meeting of Shenzhen's veteran cadres; meet with 
representatives from Shenzhen's armed police and public security 
and judicial departments; attend a forum of representatives of 
the teaching staff of Shenzhen's colleges and high schools; and 
go sightseeing in the city. However, all these arrangements 
were changed very quickly. 
  Yang was scheduled to stay at the Nanhai Hotel for one day 
and the Shenzhen Bay Hotel for another but the plan was scrapped 
later. The reason was that Yang was exposed to danger. At 
midday on 10 January, a squad of special police was transferred 
from Guangzhou to reinforce Yang's security team. 
<H3>  Homemade Bombs Were Delivered to Yang and the Shenzhen City 
CPC Committee </H3>
  --On the morning of 9 January, a stolen car containing five 
kg of explosives, petroleum, and detonators, was found 20 meters 
from the Shenzhen Guest House. In the afternoon of the same 
day, a black leather bag was discovered in the joint Shenzhen 
City CPC Committee and Government reception room. In the bag 
were two homemade bombs, on which was written: "One for Yang 
Shangkun and the other for the city party committee" and signed 
"Communists." 
  --On the evening of 9 January, the city party committee and 
the city's public security bureau received an anonymous 
telephone call threatening to destroy Yang's special car and 
saying a time bomb had been planted in a certain place. 
  --At midday on 10 January, "reactionary" posters and 
leaflets 
were found in Shenzhen and Shekou which read: "Do not be misled 
by the false appearances covering up the corrupt Shenzhen City 
CPC Committee!"; "What is the difference between the Kuomintang 
in 1949 and the Communist Party in the 1990's?"; "If Yang 
Shangkun rids the people of a scourge, he is welcome; if he 
shelters officials, he must quit!"; "Shenzhen is not the 
people's paradise but a place where high officials and noble 
lords gain fame and fortune." 
  It has been learned that leaflets were elegantly printed and 
their contents were endorsed by Shenzhen residents. The local 
government has ordered the public security bureau to crack the 
case and regard it as a serious one. They want to prevent the 
news about the case from spreading. 
<H3>  A Demobilized Soldier Threw a Bottle of Liquid Fuel at 
Yang's Car </H3>
  On the morning of 9 January, Yang spent an hour taking a 
walk 
in the Four Seas Park. As he was getting in his car to leave an 
emergency occurred took place within two meters of his car and a 
person in his thirties was arrested by the special police. 
According to a report, the Molotov cocktail thrower, called Xu, 
was a local demobilized soldier-turned security chief of a 
certain luxury hotel. He darted through the cordon and threw 
the Molotov cocktail at Yang's limousine. When the bottle hit 
the ground the liquid splashed toward the car but the flames 
were immediately put out by the special police using the fire 
extinguishers in the car. 
  In the evening of the same day, shots were heard outside the 
Silver Lake Hotel where Yang was staying. The local public 
security bureau disclosed that some people fired shots into the 
air over the Yinhu Hotel and over the Shekou China Merchants 
Steam Navigation Company Guest House for senior cadres, where 
Yang was supposed to stay. 
  It is reported that the Shenzhen City CPC Committee Standing 
Committee and leading cadres of the Shenzhen Public Security 
Bureau were kept very busy by the incidents. When the CPC 
hierarchy learned about the incidents, they were concerned for 
Yang's safety. As a result, Yang's itinerary was amended and an 
additional two special police vehicles were ordered to escort 
him as of 10 January. 
<H3>  Eight Units Asked for an Interview With Yang To Present 
Petitions </H3>
  On 11 January, representatives from eight local government 
departments went to the city party committee secretary's office 
to ask permission to see Yang and submit petitions. The 
government departments reportedly included the local 
procuratorate, court, and discipline inspection commissions. 
Some government departments in other areas across the province 
also sent representatives to Shenzhen to ask for an interview 
with Yang and present petitions when they learned that Yang was 
there. According to a source, the staffers of the city party 
committee adopted a rude attitude towards the representatives 
and the two parties had a row. The city committee standing 
committee members on duty told the representatives to write 
directly to the central authorities or to Yang to make 
complaints. It is reported that most complaints concerned 
corruption in the party and government departments including 
manmade resistance and pressure encountered by judicial 
departments in investigating and handling serious economic cases 
as well as collusion between local and central departments in 
practicing graft and taking bribes. 
  The Shenzhen Discipline Inspection Commission some days ago 
told the provincial party committee that 80 percent of criminal 
cases defied investigation and that 70 percent of discipline 
inspection commission members had asked to be transferred to 
other posts. 
  When commenting on the incidents in Shenzhen and Shekou, a 
Beijing public security cadre conjectured in private that the 
incidents were organized by some people who were angry with 
corruption and bureaucracy in the party and government 
departments. He added: "Of course, we cannot rule out the 
possibility that the incidents were caused by personal grudges. 
Yang was possibly only an `innocent victim.' The incidents 
were more likely designed to serve as a warning to the 
hierarchy: You must not always praise the special economic 
zone; instead, you must try to find out the situation with the 
party, the political situation, and public opinion." 
  The cadre said: Nobody should use violence, no matter what 
kind of grudge they may have. "On the other hand, the central 
authorities should make a self-examination and draw a lesson 
from the incidents--they should allow the people the freedom to 
vent their spleen instead of strengthening the dictatorship."

<F P=106> [By RENMIN GONGAN BAO reporter Sun Baoye (1327 1405 0673), </F>
staff correspondent Li Bingtian (2621 3521 1131) and staff 
reporter Sun Chunying (1327 2504 5391): "Eradicate All Vices--a 
Record of How Guns and Drugs Are Seized in the Southwest Border 
Areas"--first three grafs are FAZHI RIBAO introduction] 
  [Excerpts] Material provided by authoritative departments 
shows that gun and drug trafficking in the southwest border 
areas has tended to become increasingly rampant. Despite a 
sustained, continuous, and severe crackdown on such activities, 
they are still spreading. 
  In 1992, the public security organs of Yunnan and Guangxi 
Provinces uncovered 36 armed drug trafficking gangs. The 
gangsters openly resisted inspection and arrest. Gun fights 
occurred on several occasions and seven policemen and officers 
died while 26 were wounded. 
  Guns and drugs originate from the same source and go side by 
side. Drug trafficking protected by gun trafficking has 
gradually become more conspicuous and there is no end of trouble 
for the future. The Ministry of Public Security has determined 
to adopt extraordinary measures and will strive to stop the 
smuggling of guns and drugs within the boundary of the southwest 
border areas within three years in a bid to provide a basic 
solution to the problem of gun and drug trafficking. 
<H3>  I. Guns and Drugs Come From Abroad and Are Trafficked 
Everywhere in China </H3>
  China's southwest borders on the world's biggest source of 
drug production, the "golden triangle." In the past few years, 
the area of land growing opium poppies in the "golden triangle" 
has been enlarging. The output of opium has constantly 
increased and drug processing has developed very rapidly. In 
1992, the output of opium was already as high as 2,500 tonnes 
and there were more than 60 heroin processing plants. The 
international drug trafficking syndicates have tried by every 
means to open up a "passageway in China." Some lawbreakers in 
China have put money before everything else, colluded with drug 
lords outside our borders, taken part in the transfer of drugs, 
and aggravated the vicious development of drug trafficking. 
Armed separatist regimes in Burma regard drug trafficking as 
the main source of their operational funds and the amounts of 
drugs entering China from Vietnam and Laos are increasing. This 
has resulted in the expansion of the drug "market" and has 
abetted the development of drug trafficking in China. According 
to statistics, in the early 1980's, the number of drug 
trafficking cases cracked in China was less than 1,000 a year 
but in 1992, the number of drug trafficking cases cracked 
reached as many as 14,000. 
  Guns and drugs originate from the same source and they go 
side by side. Because of war and armed separatist regimes, a 
large number of military weapons are scattered among the people 
in Vietnam, Laos, and Burma and these guns are sold in the 
border areas of China. Some domestic criminals and criminal 
gangs in Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan have tried very hard to 
obtain guns from the southwest border areas in China. According 
to statistics, 1,205 cases of gun trafficking occurred across 
the country in 1992, of which 464 were filed in Yunnan, Guangxi, 
and Hainan, accounting for 39 percent of the total. 
  According to reports, half of the military weapons seized in 
Yunnan Province in 1993 came from the Sino-Vietnamese border 
areas. [passage omitted] 
<H3>  II.The Criminal Gangs Have Combined Supply, Transportation, 
and Sales </H3>
  The amount of weapons and drugs trafficked by individuals is 
far less than that by criminal gangs. At present, most gun and 
drug trafficking activities are international criminal 
activities. Domestic criminals have colluded with criminals 
outside to form professional and international syndicates and 
they have combined supply, transportation, and sales. This has 
an abominable impact on the society. 
  [Passage omitted] It is said that a considerable amount of 
drugs are sold to Taiwan via the mainland. On 13 May 1993, a 
border defense detachment in Quanzhou, Fujian Province, found 36 
kg of heroin on a Taiwan ship. The heroin originated in the 
southwest border areas. 
  The Longgang Border Defense Station in Shantou, Guangdong 
Province, unexpectedly seized during inspection 34.2 kg of drugs 
on a Taiwan fishing boat. [passage omitted] 
  In 1992, Yunnan cracked 15 major cases of heroin 
trafficking, 
in each of which over 30 kg of heroin was seized. All such 
heroin trafficking was carried out by criminal gangs. 
<H3>  III. The Southwest Border Areas Have Become "Areas Seriously 
Infested" With Gun and Drug Trafficking: "When the City Gate 
Catches Fire, the Fish in the Moat Suffer" </H3>
  The boundary line between Yunnan and Guangxi on the one side 
and the neighboring countries on the other is very strange. A 
road, a small river, or a low bank of earth between fields can 
be a national boundary. The national boundary even passes 
through a building and one part of the building is in one 
country and the other part in the other. When the local people 
start cooking their meals and find they have no more soya sauce, 
they can go and buy soya sauce from the other country and return 
to continue their cooking. It can thus be seen that under such 
circumstances, infiltration can hardly be prevented. Much less 
is it easy to stop the activities of international criminal 
syndicates which are trying to open up a passage, an entrepot 
market, and a consumers market in China in an organized and 
premeditated manner. 
  According to reports, gun and drug trafficking in the 
border areas of Yunnan and Guangxi is very conspicuous and such 
areas have become the most seriously infested gun and drug 
trafficking areas in China at present in terms not only of the 
increasing number of gun and drug cases but also of the abrupt 
growth in the number of major cases. 
  According to reports, in 1992, the public security organs 
cracked 5,609 drug trafficking cases in Yunnan and Guangxi, 14 
percent more than the previous year and accounting for 38.2 
percent of the total number of drug trafficking cases in China; 
3,974 kg of heroin was seized, 1.5 times more than in the 
previous year and accounting for 88.5 percent of the total 
amount seized in China; and 1,190 military weapons were seized, 
1.9 times that in the previous year and accounting for 80 
percent of the total seized in China. From January to December 
1993, the number of military weapons seized by the public 
security and border defense departments in Guangxi was more than 
2 times over that for the whole of 1992. In Yunnan alone, 68 
major cases of drug trafficking involving over 10 kg of drugs 
each were cracked in 1992, 84 percent up on the previous year; 
and from January to September 1993, 81 major cases of this kind 
were cracked, 20 cases more than the same period the previous 
year. [passage omitted] 
<H3>  IV. Gun and Drug Trafficking Has Led to a Lot of Problems in 
Social Order </H3>
  The easy access to guns and drugs in the southwest border 
areas has led to a series of problems in social order: 
  The number of drug addicts has increased by a large amount. 
In 1992, over 40,000 drug addicts were registered in Yunnan and 
Guangxi. 
  Gun trafficking, drug trafficking, and drug abuse have 
induced a rise in various other criminal cases in the border 
areas. In 1992, the shocking number of nearly 100,000 criminal 
cases occurred in Guangxi. 
  Drug trafficking has caused serious damage to the national 
economy in the border areas. In 1992, over 100 million yuan 
flew out of the country because of drug trafficking. 
  Large stockpiles of guns held in the border areas in the 
course of drug trafficking have become an extremely important 
hidden danger to local social order. The rising prices of guns 
will also increase by a big margin the number of cases of 
illegal manufacture of guns. 
  [Passage omitted] In China, the number of criminal cases 
involving the use of guns has increased annually and the number 
of cases where guns have been used to murder or rob has 
increased by a big margin. This is directly related to the 
rampant gun trafficking activities in the southwest border 
areas. The gun used in the "1.31" case to kill a Beijing taxi 
driver in March 1993 was bought in Yunnan. In 1992, several 
hundred cases of using guns to commit crime occurred in 
Guangdong and Hainan. Of the 130 military weapons seized in 
Guangzhou City alone, 72 were bought by criminals from Guangxi, 
34 from Vietnam, and six from Yunnan. 
  At present, over 600 cities and counties have discovered 
drugs or guns trafficked from Yunnan or Guangxi. Some of them 
have gone to Hong Kong and Macao for bank robberies and 
kidnappings. This has not only adversely affected the social 
order of Hong Kong and Macao, but also seriously damaged China's 
image. 
  [Passage omitted] It is high time we resolutely made our 
minds up to thoroughly resolve the problem of gun and drug 
trafficking in the southwest border areas. At the beginning of 
1993, Tao Siju, minister of public security, chaired two 
ministerial work meetings to specially study work in this 
respect. In June 1993, the Ministry of Public Security held a 
work meeting on seizing guns and drugs in the southwest border 
areas and explicitly put forward the task of adopting an 
extraordinary attitude and measures and striving to basically 
stop guns and drugs from entering the territory within three 
years. 
<H3>  V. Three Defense Lines Have Been Set Up To Stop Gun and Drug 
Trafficking in Border Areas of Yunnan and Guangxi </H3>
  [passage omitted] 
<H3>  VI. Work To Seize Guns and Drugs Develops With Irresistible 
Force </H3>

  In the fight against gun and drug trafficking, the public 
security and border defense departments of Yunnan and Guangxi 
Provinces have mobilized the strength of the whole society and 
have waged a people's war with great efforts. At present, a 
struggle by the masses of people to seize guns and drugs has 
been extensively launched in the southwest border areas. There 
have been numerous incidents of people reporting information 
about drug crimes and assisting public security organs to arrest 
criminals. On 31 August 1993, after a village cadre of Fengyi 
Town, Dali City, Yunnan, discovered a drug trafficker, more than 
50 common people helped the policemen to search the hills 
despite the rain. They arrested the criminal and seized 6.8 kg 
of heroin. Since June 1993, the public security and border 
defense departments have received 213 reports on gun trafficking 
made by the common people. Thanks to these reports, 12 military 
weapons and several handgrenades were seized and 15 gun 
traffickers were arrested. 
  Since the June 1993 Ministry of Public Security meeting on 
work to seize guns and drugs in the southwest borders, reports 
on victories scored by the "three defense lines" in the 
southwest border areas have come one after another. 
  On 28 June, the Dongfengqiao Checkpoint at Baoshan, Yunnan 
Province, seized 3.6 kg of opium from a car from Tengchong and 
arrested a drug trafficker. 
  On 13 July, the Longzhou Border Defense Headquarters in 
Guangxi Province cracked a gun trafficking case and seized a 
U.S. weapon, 40 rounds of ammunition, and a handgrenade. 
  In eight days from 3 to 10 August, the Nasuo Public Security 
Border Defense Checkpoint in Guangxi cracked seven gun 
trafficking cases, seized 10 military weapons and 12 antitank 
grenades, and arrested 14 gun traffickers. The checkpoint also 
cracked a drug trafficking case, seizing 360 g of heroin and 
arresting two drug traffickers. To commend the checkpoint, the 
Ministry of Public Security awarded it the Merit Citation 2d 
Class and awarded all the personnel in the checkpoint and other 
people concerned merit citation and material rewards. 
  On 25 September, the Mengdong Border Defense Substation in 
Yunnan seized a light machine gun, a heavy machine gun, and a 
"40" [as published] rocket launcher. On 27 September, the 
Dehong Border Defense Detachment cracked a major drug 
trafficking case at Jiegao, Ruili County, and seized 14.5 kg of 
drugs. 
  By the end of September, the Yunnan Border Defense 
Headquarters had cracked 501 drug trafficking cases, of which 20 
were major cases involving 10 kg of drugs each, arrested 595 
drug traffickers, and seized over 510 kg of heroin and over 550 
kg of opium. The headquarters also had cracked 57 gun 
trafficking cases, seized 75 military weapons, 12 rocket 
launchers, and 9,789 rounds of ammunition. 
  On 15 December, the Aidian Border Defense Work Station in 
Guangxi laid an ambush on the Chinese side of a certain boundary 
tablet and seized 13 military weapons and 39 rounds of 
ammunition. 
  On 24 December, the Ningming County Border Defense 
Headquarters in Guangxi cracked a major case of gun trafficking 
and seized 10 military weapons and 40 rounds of ammunition. 
  Up to December, the Guangxi Border Defense Headquarters had 
cracked over 100 gun trafficking cases, seized over 200 military 
weapons, 845 handmade guns, 5,600 rounds of ammunition, and 146 
antitank grenades, and arrested 129 criminals. The headquarters 
had also cracked 42 drug trafficking cases, seized over 3,000 kg 
of opium and 7 kg of heroin, and arrested 50 drug traffickers.

  A major criminal syndicate involved in the abduction and 
sale 
of women has been cracked in Togtoh county, Inner Mongolia, and 
44 of its 69 members have been sent to prison. The case 
involves nine prefectures and cities and 18 banners, counties, 
and cities in Yunnan, Shanxi, Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Inner 
Mongolia. The syndicate preyed on the Jiuyanqiao labor market 
in Sichuan's Chengdu, where it tricked over 200 women aged 
between 15 and 41 using the pretense of doing business and 
recruiting workers and then sold them to Inner Mongolia's 
Qingshuihe County, Jungar Banner, Tumd Left Banner, Siziwang 
Banner, and other rural areas. (Summary) (Beijing GUANGMING

  A fresh campaign to crack down on highway and railway 
robbers 
throughout Guangdong Province opened on 20 December in response

the drivers, shot one of them with a small-caliber pistol, and 
robbed them of 1.2 million yuan. Following more than 30 hours 
of investigation, the Shaoguan City, Wengyuan County, and 
Dabaoshan coal mine public security personnel cracked the case.

  In a report on the anticorruption struggle given to 
Guangdong 
People's Congress officials, Chief Procurator Wang Jun said that 
the provincial procuratorial organs has handled 905 corruption 
cases involving 1,036 people and has recovered 100 million yuan 
over the past five month. 
  The procuratorial organs cracked large numbers of major

  Nanning Prefecture has taken effective measures to conduct a 
special crackdown on drug trafficking and has achieved good 
results. According to statistics released by the relevant 
department, from June to 10 December this year, this prefecture 
cracked 46 cases of gun running and 75 drug trafficking cases, 
destroyed 22 gun-running and drug trafficking gangs, rounded up 
293 criminals, and seized 83 military firearms, 6,010 rounds of 
ammunition, 110 hand-grenades, 137.2 kg of opium, and 4.74 kg of

was the efforts of the prefectural party committee and 
government in extensively mobilizing the masses as well as the 
coordination between public security departments and frontier 
armed police units. (Text) (Nanning Guangxi People's Radio

given), has reported the arrest of a man who killed eight 
persons and ate the brains of two of his victims. Hao Kai, 34, 
a former prisoner released on parole began his bloody crimes in 
February 1993 in Harbin, when he strangled a prostitute, cut her 
body up into pieces, opened up her skull and ate her brains. 
One of Hao's employees discovered the grisly remains just two 
hours later and was also stabbed to death. Over the next nine 
months, Hao went on a killing spree, slaying six other people, 
including his wife. Each was chopped into pieces. His last 
victim was a friend from whom he wanted to borrow money. In 
this instance, Hao decided to fry the man's brains, choosing to 
add some spices in order to improve the taste, the paper said. 
Hao was sentenced to death on December 23 and execution was

  On 21 December, the Henan Provincial People's Procuratorate 
held a news briefing, and Deputy Chief Procurator Chen Gangyin 
delivered a report on the current case-handling situation. 
According to the briefing, ever since the central authorities 
launched the anticorruption campaign last August, a total of 
1,934 corruption and bribery cases has been filed for 
investigation and prosecution across the province, of which 96 
have been brought up with party and government organizations, 41 
with judicial institutions, 59 with administration and 
law-enforcement departments, and 242 with economic management 
organs. The cases involve 32 leading cadres at the county 
departmental level and above. Among the 1,124 major corruption 
and bribery cases which involve a sum exceeding 10,000 yuan 
each, 141 individuals have been accused of taking bribes between 
50,000 to 100,000 yuan; 118 between 100,000 to 500,000 yuan; and 
21 over 500,000 yuan. 
  The following cases have had a fairly great negative impact 
on society: Between 1991 and January 1992 (dates as published), 
Zhang Jianjie, head of the Agricultural Loans Department of the 
provincial Agricultural Bank, accepted bribes totalling 15,000 
yuan from a factory director for examining and approving the 
loan application of his factory in Zhengzhou. He also and 
accepted bribes of 150,000 yuan when examining and approving 
another loan application filed by a rolling mill in Anyang City. 
Informed against by the masses, Zhang Jianjie was charged by 
Zhengzhou's Jinshui District Procuratorate on 10 October 1993 
for accepting bribes of 192,000 yuan, $6,500, and various kinds 
of gold and silver ornaments valued at 4,128 yuan. The 
procuratorate has completed its investigation and has sent the 
case for examination and prosecution. 
  Fan Zhipei, head of the Financial Department of the 
provincial Family Planning Committee, received a kickback from a 
ship for his purchase of 12 air conditioners for his unit last 
May. His acceptance of Type-902 split air conditioners worth 
9,000 yuan constituted the bribery crime, and his case was filed 
for investigation and prosecution by procuratorial organs in 
September 1993. On 20 November of the same year, the 
procuratorial organs instituted proceedings with the people's 
court against Zhang Zhipei. When handling purchase control 
procedures for a unit, Qin Liuquan, deputy director of the 
Purchase Control Office of the provincial government, abused his 
power and accepted an air conditioner and a video camera valued 
at 8,480 yuan. The procuratorial organs have completed their 
investigation into the case and have sent the case for 
examination and prosecution. Cui Kejun, head of the 
Administration and Finance Department of the provincial 
Financial Bureau; Li Fangting, deputy chief of the Industrial 
and Commercial Bureau of Luohe City; Ma Xinsheng, deputy head of 
the Industrial and Commercial Bureau of Sanmenxia City; and Du 
Guangcai, deputy head of the Industrial Loans Department of the 
provincial Agricultural Bank are also involved in major 
corruption and bribery cases. 
  It has been learned that, among the 98 key cases handled by 
the provincial People's Procuratorate, investigations have been 
completed for 76, 37 of which have resulted in prosecution. The 
People's Court has passed judgment on 14 cases and 37 people, 
among whom six have been sentenced to death; eight have received 
suspended death sentences; seven have been sentenced to life 
imprisonment; and 16 have been sentenced to set terms of 
imprisonment. (Zhengzhou HENAN RIBAO in Chinese 3 Jan 94 p 1)

  On 24 December 1993, 14 prisoners convicted of murder were 
executed by Changsha City Intermediate People's Court. One of 
those convicted, Gao Xihua, was deputy general manager of the 
provincial securities company (a rank was equivalent to that of 
the deputy director of a provincial department). He murdered 
the son of his mistress, who he wanted to leave after nearly 
three years of living together, and was arrested while 
attempting suicide. Another of those convicted was Zhang Weiyi

  Wang Kaiming, vice mayor of Xianyang City, Shaanxi Province, 
was arrested on 30 December 1993 for participating in and 
supporting the fraudulent practices of a sham foreign 
businessman. In 1991, Wang, then chairman of Xianyang City 
construction committee, signed an official contract -- without 
formal approval from city government leaders -- with a peasant 
from Shangnan County who pretended to be a Hong Kong businessman 
holding Singapore citizenship on founding a joint-venture 
leasing company. Wang later covered up the partner's fraudulent 
practices and helped him borrow 8.11 million yuan, of which he 
actually received 1.53 million and subsequently squandered. The 
anticorruption campaign discovered that Wang had demanded that 
the peasant pay bribes totaling 40,000 yuan. The investigation 
of the case is continuing. (Summary) (Xian Shaanxi People's

<F P=106> [Report: "Li Peng Is To Cut the Ribbon at the Inauguration </F>
of Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station This Weekend"] 
  [Text] Chinese Premier Li Peng is arriving in Shenzhen 
this weekend to attend the ribbon-cutting ceremony of 
Guangdong's Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station. According to 
informed sources, this ceremony will be brief and short in 
accordance with the principle of "high standard, small scope" 
without giving it too much publicity. 
  Sources in Beijing said: His health permitting, Li Peng will 
definitely attend the inaugural ceremony of the Daya Bay Nuclear 
Power Station. Many personalities from the French consortium 
will also attend the ceremony. Because the No. 1 unit of the 
power station has already gone into operation and generated over 
700 million kwt-hours, this will be just a ceremony, so it will 
be as simple as possible. 
  The staff of Guangdong Provincial Nuclear Power Joint 
Venture 
Corporation have been stepping up preparations for the ceremony. 
They held a meeting yesterday to discuss arrangements for the 
procedure. One official said: The period from 4 to 6 February 
will be the busiest for receiving visitors from the State 
Council, the provincial authorities, the city authorities, and 
abroad. He said: If all goes well, Li Peng will definitely turn 
up. He said that Li Peng has always paid close attention to the 
construction of Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station and promised to 
visit it when it went into operation. 
  Sources said: After the No. 1 generating unit went into 
operation, the No. 2 unit is also entering the phase of trial 
generation in June this year. 
  It has been nearly 10 years since preparations for building 
Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station started. The total investment is 
$4 billion, making it the biggest joint-venture project in China 
up to now. Guangdong Province and Hong Kong's China Light and 
Power Company co-invested in the project a total of $400 
million, in a three to one ratio. The two 900,000-kwt 
generating units are capable of generating more than 10 billion 
kwt-hours per year, of which 70 percent is to be sold to Hong 
Kong. When the debts are repaid in 15 years' time, the 
Chinese-Hong Kong partnership will continue for another five 
years.

  [Text] Beijing, 19 Jan (XINHUA) -- Some 400 scientists of 
all ages from the capital attended a tea party at the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] Auditorium 
today to ring out the old year and ring in the new. 
  Li Ruihuan, member of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau Standing Committee and chairman of the CPPCC National 
Committee, spoke at the gathering. He said: Fundamental changes 
have taken place in China's intellectual and scientific and 
technological circles in comparison with more than a decade ago. 
These changes should be attributed to the leadership of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping in guiding the party to correct the mistake of 
taking class struggle as the key link and in setting the 
guideline of making economic construction the center of the 
party's work, as well as to his important theses -- 
"intellectuals are a part of the working class" and "science and 
technology constitute a primary productive force." 
  Li Ruihuan said: The current situation in China's 
intellectual and scientific and technological circles is 
generally good, though there are some problems. The solution to 
these problems lies in leaders' keen attention and the nation's 
economic capability, and requires a better understanding and 
earnest implementation of these two important theses of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping in actual work. It is hoped that the relevant 
departments and scientific and technology circles will work in 
concert in studying ways to implement the thesis that "science 
and technology constitutes a primary productive force," drawing 
on successful foreign experiences and formulating policies for 
combining science and technology with the development of 
production and enabling them to promote each other, thereby 
imbuing vigor and vitality into the undertaking of science and 
technology. 
  On behalf of the State Council, State Councillor Song Jian 
paid high tribute and extended warm regards to science and 
technology workers across the country. He said: The "Decision 
on Some Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist 
Market Economic Structure," adopted by the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee, has laid an important policy 
for deepening the reform of the science and technology 
management system. The implementation of the policy of "holding 
fast to one end and leaving the whole field open" -- that is, 
while redoubling research efforts in basic science and for the 
development of new and high technology, it is necessary to give 
free rein to research, development, and business activities of 
organizations engaged in developing technology or providing 
scientific and technical services -- and the establishment of a 
new science and technology management system will surely give a 
strong impetus to the strategy of "relying on science and 
technology in economic construction and gearing scientific and 
technology work to the needs of economic construction." 
  Song Jian continued: In the coming year, both central and 
local governments and enterprises should invest more in the 
development of science and technology. Party committees and 
governments at all levels and various sectors of the community 
should further improve the working and living conditions of 
scientists, show concern for the growth of young scientists, and 
train a contingent of academic and technology vanguards who will 
lead the country in the march toward the world's advanced 
science in the next century. 
  Zhu Guangya, chairman of the CPPCC Science and Technology 
Committee and chairman of the China Association for Science and 
Technology, reviewed the country's brilliant achievements in 
science and technology over the past year. He said the Science 
and Technology Committee and the Association for Science and 
Technology will continue to do everything possible to serve 
scientists and technology personnel affiliated with the 
association. 
  Wu Jieping, vice chairman of the National People's Congress 
Standing Committee, and scientists Ye Danian, Bai Chunli, Feng 
Shunshan, Lai Luhua, and He Zuoxiu also spoke at the gathering. 
They made a number of suggestions for accelerating the 
development of science and technology and bringing into better 
play the scientists' role. 
  Comrades Lie Jieqiong, Ye Xuanping, Wu Xueqian, Hong Xuezhi, 
Hu Sheng, Qian Zhengying, and Sun Fuling were present at the 
gathering.

for 1994--China To Carry Out Reform of Science and Technological 
Structure in a Comprehensive Way"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 25 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--The pace of 
China's reform of its science and technology structure was 
accelerated during the past year, and the work of establishing a 
new structure has already begun in a comprehensive way. A 
revitalized science and technological structure is gradually 
taking shape, which will benefit basic research and economic 
development. 
  In 1994, organizational reform in science and technology 
research institutions will be further carried out in depth, with 
structural readjustment and the flow of talent as the main 
tasks. Through readjustment, the contingent of science and 
technology workers, who are either engaged in basic scientific 
research, high-tech research, or tackling major science and 
technology problems and developing research projects for social 
benefits, will become more highly trained and the structure will 
become more reasonable. The internal structures of various 
science and technology research institutions will be further 
readjusted and new and more competitive management and 
operational systems will be adopted. The duplicated 
organizations will be merged and streamlined and the excess 
personnel will be allowed to flow and enter the market. Large 
numbers of technological development and technology service 
organizations will march toward the market at a faster pace. 
They will establish enterprises or be changed into science and 
technology enterprises or enterprise groups. At present, there 
are already dozens of high science and technology enterprises in 
China, which were established by science and technology research 
institutions. They receive an income of some ten million yuan or 
even a hundred million yuan a year. 
  The civilian-run science and technology enterprises will 
develop at a higher speed. China now has a total of 40,000 
civilian-run science and technology enterprises, of which more 
than 10,000 were established last year. Henan, Shaanxi, and 
other provinces have made decisions on speeding up development 
of civilian-run enterprises in the name of the provincial party 
committee and government and have worked out some new measures. 
The number of newly established civilian-run enterprises will 
be much higher this year than last year. 
  Development of the technological market has entered a new 
historical stage. According to calculations, the turnover of 
technological transactiona reached more than 18 billion yuan in 
1993. The figure was just a little higher than 10 billion yuan 
the previous year. All kinds of technological transaction 
activities have been frequently and dynamically carried out in 
various localities and at various levels. Intermediary 
organizations, such as invisible assets assessment offices and 
science and technology agents' offices, have emerged everywhere 
in the country. Experiments in selected areas on a permanent 
technological market have also been carried out smoothly. 
Barriers between the various regions and departments have been 
smashed and an open and unified nationwide technological market 
system has begun to take shape. 
  Legal construction for science and technology has been 
developing steadily. With the promulgation and implementation 
of the "Law on Science and Technology Progress," science and 
technology work has been brought onto a track of operating in 
accordance with the legal system. The task of working out and 
implementing relevant laws and regulations on protecting 
intellectual property rights will be continued this year. The 
establishment of special court of science and technology and 
court of intellectual rights in Beijing and other areas has 
provided an effective guarantee for fighting against the illegal 
practices of violating intellectual property rights and 
plagiarizing and forging achievements of science and technology 
research and for protecting the legitimate rights of science and 
technology institutions and personnel. The number of such 
courts can increase this year. 
  In 1994, the management method of science and technology 
management departments at all levels will be further improved 
and geared to the needs of the market. 
  The 21st century will be one of science and technology. The 
Chinese people are still faced with a grim reality. According 
to the latest statistics, China ranks 12th in the world in the 
number of science and technology treatises published, rising 
three places from last year, but it is 17th in the treatises on 
basic research, dropping two. The ultimate purposes of China's 
reform of the science and technology structure are: First, to 
combine science and technology with economic development more 
closely and second, to promote the development of science and 
technology, especially basic research. Whether China's reform 
of the science and technology structure is successful or not 
will chiefly be reflected by the achievements in these two 
fields.

<F P=106> [By Kuang Tianpu (6782 3944 0944): "Abiding By Law To </F>
Manage Ground Equipment for Receiving Satellite Television 
Broadcasts"] 
  [Text] On 5 October 1993, the State Council promulgated 
the "Regulations on Managing Ground Equipment for Receiving 
Satellite Television Broadcasts" (the "Regulations"). This is 
an important law governing the management of satellite 
television broadcasts in our country and it has great 
significance to the healthy and orderly development of our 
country's satellite television broadcasts, to the protection of 
the Chinese nation's fine cultural traditions, to the promotion 
of socialist spiritual civilization, and to the maintenance of 
social stability. 
<H3>  I. Our Country's Satellite Television Broadcasts Develop 
Rapidly and Must Be Managed According to Law </H3>
  Since August 1985, our country has been using satellite 
television broadcasting technology to transmit television 
programs and to expand the areas covered by television 
broadcasts. Before that, we mainly relied on building ground 
microwave transmission networks for transmitting television 
programs, to increase the coverage rate of the population 
receiving television. Our country is vast and has a varied 
topography, over 70 percent of the land is hilly and mountainous 
areas and microwave transmission technology is affected and 
hindered by terrain and landscape. For this reason, the 
coverage rate of the population receiving television did not 
increase rapidly. By 1985, after efforts for over 20 years, the 
coverage rate of the population receiving television had not 
reached 50 percent. After using satellites to transmit 
television programs, because it saves on investment, involves 
less transmission links, has a wide coverage area, and is free 
from the restrictions of terrain and landscape, it has developed 
very rapidly. By 1992, in just seven years, the coverage rate 
of the population receiving television in the whole country 
swiftly rose to 81.3 percent and satellite television 
broadcasting has already become an important means of solving 
the problem of television covering areas in our country. 
  At present, the Central Television Station transmits four 
television programs through satellites, whereas the five 
provincial television stations in Xinjiang, Tibet, Yunnan, 
Guizhou, and Sichuan also use satellites to transmit their 
programs; an educational television program is also transmitted 
through satellite. It is estimated that this year, some other 
provincial television stations will also use satellites to 
transmit their programs. We can say that satellite television 
broadcasting is now in the ascendancy in our country. 
  Along with the development of satellite television 
broadcasts 
in our country, the demand for group equipment for receiving 
satellite television has rapidly swelled. By the end of 1992, 
the country had 39,000 satellite television receivers and 
transmitters. At the same time, the satellite television 
programs which are transmitted from outside our borders but can 
be received inside the country have continuously increased, and 
there is an increasing number of people who have produced, sold, 
installed, and used ground equipment to receive television 
programs from outside our borders, thus, serious chaos has 
emerged. Various types of enterprises have opened factories and 
workshops without restrictions or planning and the equipment 
they produce varies in quality, whereas some sales units forget 
about obligations when lured by benefits and sell low-quality 
equipment, or smuggle in products to evade tariffs, causing 
serious harm to the interests of consumers and the country. 
This not only endangers the healthy development of our new 
industry producing equipment to receive satellite television but 
is also unfavorable to socialist spiritual civilization 
construction. It was precisely under such conditions that the 
"Regulations" were formulated, promulgated, and implemented, to 
enable the healthy development of the satellite television 
undertaking to have legal protection. 
<H3>  II. Managing Reception of Satellite Television Broadcasts 
According to Law, Is an Important Means of Exercising and 
Safeguarding State Sovereignty </H3>
  Since 15 November 1983 when the United States for the first 
time transmitted a direct-broadcast satellite television 
program, satellite television undertakings have sprung up like 
mushrooms in various parts of the world. In particular, since 
the 1990's, satellite television undertakings in various 
countries have entered a period of great development. Although 
the International Telecommunications Union has produced an 
agreement which says that the television programs of various 
countries should be directed to the areas of the countries 
concerned, for technical and political reasons, the "spill over" 
phenomenon whereby a country's satellite television 
intentionally surpasses national boundaries to cover other 
countries and areas has become more serious and the "electric 
wave battle" in the air has become more intensified. Many 
countries have expressed worries at the increasing number of 
trespassing television programs and a lot of these countries 
have restricted the reception of satellite television and 
carried out management according to their own national and 
public interests. For example, Malaysia views management of 
foreign satellite television as a political issue which has a 
bearing on national security, clearly stipulating that no 
individual or family should receive foreign satellite 
television. Japan's Electric Wave Law stipulates that the 
wireless and cable television stations in the country cannot 
relay television programs from outside the border; at the same 
time, Japanese law stipulates that residents can only receive 
the directly broadcast satellite television programs transmitted 
by NHK and Nippon Satellite Broadcasting Corporation. Britain's 
New Broadcasting Ordinance clearly stipulates that the 
Independent Commission for Television has the power to cancel 
any "unacceptable" foreign satellite television programs 
scheduled for the television channels under its jurisdiction. 
  In fact, managing satellite television broadcasts according 
to law is the undisputable authority of any sovereign country. 
The reason is simply that no sovereign country would allow 
other countries to establish television stations or other news 
agencies on its soil without any restrictions. Whereas 
satellite television programs trespass the borders and cover 
areas in other countries and would it not be equal to allowing 
other countries to establish television stations on the soil of 
a sovereign country if nothing is done to restrict them? At the 
same time, when a sovereign nation, proceeding from the need to 
safeguard and develop the nation's own cultural patterns, 
values, morals, and social stability, carries out management of 
the trespassing satellite television according to the law of the 
country, it is completely a matter of sovereignty. As early as 
1972, the 17th meeting of the UN Educational, Scientific and 
Cultural Organization stipulated that a country has absolute 
power to select and criticize the information (news) coming from 
any other channels. 
  What must be further pointed out is that, at present, our 
country is covered by about a dozen satellite television 
channels from outside our borders. According to an estimate, in 
the next 10 years, some 120 television broadcasting satellites 
will be launched by various countries and about half of these 
satellites will be in Asia, where most areas of our country will 
be able to receive programs. If we do not give management but 
let units and individuals receive those programs, then it is no 
different from establishing inside our country several dozen 
television stations which are run from outside the border. 
Setting aside what kind of subtle influence the values, morals, 
and cultural patterns publicized by these television programs 
will have on our country's audience, especially young people, 
speaking just in terms of safeguarding the country's 
sovereignty, it is absolutely necessary for us to manage 
according to law the reception of satellite television programs, 
especially the television programs beamed from outside our 
borders. This is also an important measure for exercising and 
safeguarding state sovereignty. 
<H3>  III. The Contents of the "Regulations" Accord With the 
Actual Situation of Development of Television Undertakings in 
Our Country and Is Identical to the Policy of Opening Up to the 
Outside World </H3>
  Since the birth of television undertakings in our country 
some 30 years ago, we have been using the method of collectively 
relaying and transmitting television signals to households and 
individuals for them to watch. That is, television program 
signals are provided by the wireless television stations, 
television transmitting stations, and satellite ground stations 
set up by the broadcasting and television departments at various 
levels. 
  This method is very practical and is in accordance with our 
country's actual situation in terms of solving the problem of 
the rate of population covered by television in a developing 
country like us, with 1.2 billion people, a relatively low per 
capita income, and a comparatively backward economy. With this 
method, some 800 million people in the country have been able to 
watch television programs and in many places they can even watch 
several programs, while in the places with cable television, 
they can watch nearly 10 programs. As the problem of television 
coverage rate was being solved, television programs became 
increasingly abundant. In particular, since reform and opening 
up, our country's television departments have worked hard to 
improve the quality and increase the quantity of programs made 
by themselves and, at the same time, also established relations 
on exchanging and trading of programs with the television 
organizations in many countries and regions in the world. They 
have imported a large quantity of television programs of various 
kinds that can be beamed outside our borders. In recent years, 
the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television has signed 82 
agreements or memoranda of agreement on cooperation with 41 
countries such as France, Britain, and Italy, as well as with 
two international organizations. The Central Television Station 
signed cooperation agreements on providing news to United 
Independent Television News Agency which is a U.S.-British joint 
venture, Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), Cable News Network 
(CNN), Nippon Hoso Kyokai (NHK), East European Broadcasting 
Union, and Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union. 
  Since realizing round-the-clock operations for broadcasting 
news 11 times every day last year, the Central Television 
Station has been able to immediately broadcast important 
international news. Apart from this, the television programs -- 
including cultural, sports, scientific, technological, and 
cartoon programs -- which are made outside our borders and 
acquired through trading, buying, or exchanging of copyright by 
various television stations, have been broadcast in large 
numbers. In particular, the international film festival which 
is organized in turn by Sichuan and Shanghai every year, 
provides a stable opportunity for exchanges of programs between 
our country's television circles and the television 
organizations in various countries in the world. Along with the 
deepening of the reform and opening up, our country's television 
undertaking will further develop and television programs will 
become richer to satisfy, as much as possible, the people's 
demands for obtaining important international and domestic news 
as well as meeting their cultural and recreational needs. 
  Carrying out the necessary restriction and management of 
reception of satellite television beamed from outside our 
borders does not contradict the open-door policy in our country. 
As we have mentioned before, our country's television circles 
have established many kinds of relations of exchanging 
television programs with many countries, to introduce to the 
people in the whole country the outstanding cultures from 
various places in the world through television. This is also to 
let the Chinese people know the world better and learn and 
borrow from the outstanding foreign cultures. 
  In order to satisfy the special needs of some units and 
venues when implementing the "Regulations," the relevant 
departments will, after examination and approval, allow 
financial, economic, and trade units, foreigner-admitting 
three-star hotels and the second-class hotels judged by state 
standards, and the offices and apartments used by foreigners and 
the people from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, to install 
equipment to directly receive the satellite television programs 
beamed from outside the border. 
  When we stress management according to law, our basic 
purpose 
is to enable satellite television to better serve our country's 
economic construction, reform, and opening up, and to serve 
socialist spiritual civilization construction as well.

Song Wenjie (1345 2429 2638)] 
  [Text] Lanzhou, 23 Jan (XINHUA) -- China has made another 
step forward in catching up with the advanced world level in 
nuclear physics studies. A medium-energy, heavy ion 
radioactive, singular nuclear secondary beam [zhong neng zhong 
li zi fang she xing qi yi he ci ji shu liu xian 0022 5174 6850 
4418 1311 2397 1410 1840 1142 8381 2702 2945 4787 2631 3177 
4848] was recently built in Lanzhou, and the device produced 
over 30 types of neutron-enriched [feng zhong zi 0023 0022 1311] 
radioactive singular nuclear beams. 
  The secondary beam was built at the Lanzhou State Laborary 
of 
the Heavy Ion Accelerator. The 40 meter-long piece of equipment 
has more than 20 sets of magnetic lenses, four sets of beam 
probes, primary and secondary target chambers, and complex 
probing and identifying equipment. It has 40 expansion 
parameters [he tiao can shu 0668 6148 0639 2422]. Its main 
features are primarily those of crushing nuclei with 
medium-energy [zhong neng dan he sui lie 0022 5174 1734 2702 
4295 5933] and transfering response [zhuan yi fan ying 6567 4448 
0646 2019]. Scientists can use the Argon-40 beam, with energy 
of 25 megavolts from each nucleus, generated by the heavy ion 
accelerator to bombard an aluminum-27 nuclear target and produce 
more than 30 kinds of radioactive singular nuclear beams, 
including magnesium-30, carbon-15, and lithium-9. The energy 
generated by the secondary beams ranges from 15 to 20 megavolts 
per nucleus, and their atomic numbers are 2 to 14. Chinese 
scientists will use this secondary beam to study superheavy 
nuclei, the possibility of synthisizing nuclides, astrophysics, 
and application of nuclear technology. 
  Knowledge about nuclear physics used to be acquired 
primarily 
through the studies of stable nuclei. Since the 1980's, 
products created through reactions from primary targets have 
been reused as bullets, or "secondary beams." The use of 
secondary beams has diversified the combination of "bullets" and 
"targets," creating unprecedented opportunities for acquiring 
new knowledge about atom nuclei. Using radioactive, singular 
secondary beams to discover and identify new nuclides and study 
new decay modes and decay characters are new means of 
experimentation in the world, and China is currently the fifth 
country in the world possessing this advanced means of 
experimentation. 
  The Chinese Academy of Sciences [CAS] has listed the 
construction of this secondary beam, which is one of the 
projects China has launched with the aim of catching up with the 
advanced world level, as a subsidiary project for the Eighth 
Five-Year Plan period. The construction has been successfully 
completed as result of the great support and assistance from the 
State Science and Technology Commission, the CAS, the State 
Natural Sciences Foundation, and the Lanzhou State Laboratory of 
Heavy Ion Accelerator.

  [Text] Beijing, February 1 (XINHUA) -- China is to import 
more technology and equipment this year, a Chinese business 
leader said here today. 
  The China National Technology Import and Export Corporation 
(CNTIC), the country's largest technology importer and exporter, 
plans to import four billion U.S. dollars' worth of technology 
and to export 350 million U.S. dollars' worth. 
  According to Tong Changyin, CNTIC's general manager, the 
corporation's volume of imports last year hit a record high of 
3.94 billion U.S. dollars, while exports totalled 310 million 
U.S. dollars. 
  At the company's annual working meeting, Tong said that his 
company signed contracts for some national or local key projects 
in the past year, which ensured the smooth development of the 
company's business. 
  These projects included the Henan Yahekou power station, 
Shandong Zouxian power station, Zhejiang Tianhuangping pump 
storage power station, Liaoning Fushun steel plant and Dalian 
steel plant. 
  CNTIC also made progress in export of equipment, high 
technology and high-tech products, signing contracts with 
relevant companies of Kuwait and Pakistan. 
  On the company's plans for this year, Tong said that CNTIC 
will continue its focus on import of equipment for key national 
projects, development of equipment, high-tech products and 
exports of machinery and electronic products with high extra 
value. 
  The company will thus strengthen its cooperative relations 
with all departments of the State Council, foreign trade 
advisory companies, investment companies, Bank of Development 
and other relevant departments all over the country. 
  Tong said that CNTIC will also set up high-tech development 
companies to form a system of research, design, 
trial-production, manufacture, and domestic and foreign market 
expansion, and to use overseas funds to import foreign 
experience of management and advanced technical equipment. 
  Tong said that in 1994, CNTIC will establish new offices in 
the south Pacific Ocean region, Latin America, Africa and the 
Gulf region. 
  The setting-up of headquarters in Southeast Asia and the 
Gulf 
region will be finished by the end of the year, he said. 
  Tong also said that CNTIC will make efforts to practise a 
share- holding system and act as a business agency, and to start 
a corporation group by the end of the year.

<F P=106> [By He Jun: "Technology Transfers Increase by Big Margin"] </F>
  [Text] China's fledgeling technology market reported a 
record turnover of almost $2.4 billion last year, up nearly 40 
percent on 1992. The figure covered technology transactions 
registered across the country. But does not include the Tibet 
region and Shenzhen Special Economic Zone. 
  The technology market was first introduced into China nine 
years ago. 
  And the paid transfer of science and technology has helped 
the country's development, according to Han Deqian, 
Vice-Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission 
(SSTC). 
  The government has helped the market by introducing 
competitive mechanisms and protecting intellectual property 
rights. 
  And the market boom indicated that China's technological 
market had "entered a new era," Han said. 
  The boom was spread right across the country last year with 
each of the 25 provinces, autonomous legions and cities dealing 
in at least $11.5 of technology transfer contracts. 
  Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which saw a 105 per cent 
jump in its technology trade over the previous year, was singled 
out by Han. But Beijing stayed at the top of the table with a 
contract volume of over $400 million. Of the 29 provinces, 
municipalities and autonomous regions in the survey, 28 
witnessed expansion of their local technomarket. 
  And the average value of individual contracts rose by over 
30 
percent to $9,700. 
  This indicated a remarkable improvement in the level and 
quality of the traded technologies, Han said. 
  China will focus on improving the management, legal, 
supervision and investment systems for the technological market. 
  And it will aim to establish a competitive and standardized 
technomarket, Han said. 
  Full support would be made available to train techno-agents 
and to develop the market's intermediary institutes. The 
technology market is an important part of China's market 
economy, he said. 
  And it was keeping pace with a country, which was taking off 
economically. 
  In the past years, the central and local governments have 
pushed Chinese scientists and technicians to devote themselves 
to the commercialization, industrialization and 
internationalization of technology.

  [Editorial Report] Shanghai WEN HUI BAO in Chinese on 22 
January carries a 4,000-character article by Lieutenant General 
Shi Zhiqing, political commissar of the Air Force of the Nanjing 
Military Region, entitled: "Being Too Slow in Development Cannot 
Be Called Socialism" on page 7 of the paper's special column on 
seriously studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping. 
  The article cited Deng Xiaoing's remarks made in October 
1987 
saying "poorness is not socialism, and being too slow in 
development is also not socialism," Deng Xiaoing's talks during 
his southern inspection tour, and Deng Xiaoping's remarks saying 
"whether China can resist the pressure of hegemonism and power 
politics and firmly adhere to our socialist system, the key lies 
in whether we can gain a relatively fast speed in growth and 
realize our development strategy or not." The article cites 
rapid economic growth during period from 1984 to 1988, in which 
the average annual growth of industrial output was 21.7 percent. 
The article says the speed stressed by Deng Xiaoping is 
different from the speed stressed during the "Great Leap 
Forward" in 1958. It says Deng Xiaoping has drawn a bitter 
lesson from the "Great Leap Forward" and attached importance to 
quality and efficiency in seeking development speed. Deng 
Xiaoping has always linked accelerating development with 
deepening reform and further opening up and called for turning 
science and technology into productive forces. In conclusion, 
the article says such speed as advocated by Deng Xiaoping is a 
genuine and sustained speed which can promote China's economic 
development amid widespread recession in the world.

and Control Last Year Only Tackled the Symptoms But Not Root 
Cause, and `Soft Landing' of Economy Is Still Needed This Year"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 27 Jan (TA KUNG PAO)--A central leader 
recently stressed in a speech that in 1994, China's economy 
still needs a "soft landing." He also stressed the need to 
seize the opportunity to carry out the reform well, and 
completely solve problems arising from development. 
  This central leader said that macroeconomic regulation and 
control in 1993 only tackled the symptoms but not the root 
cause. Some problems which have emerged in the forward progress 
since the rapid development in 1992, were not solved last year, 
and could not be solved last year; if efforts were made to solve 
them last year, it would mean a "hard landing," big 
fluctuations, and vibrations in the society. The method adopted 
during macroeconomic regulation and control in 1993, was to 
tackle the symptoms, so it could only achieve limited goals, 
such as checking the inflationary trend, the growing trend of 
excessively large scales of capital construction, and the trend 
in which large amounts of money were being released by banks. 
The number of construction projects underway at this moment is 
three times that of 1991. We must continue the "soft landing" 
in 1994, and capital construction cannot rise rapidly. This 
central leader said that the duty of macroeconomic regulation 
and control has not yet been fulfilled, and it has not "landed" 
at this moment, therefore it must continue the "soft landing" 
this year. If it always "does not land," or even flies upward, 
a "hard landing" is needed when problems erupt, by then, the 
consequences are hard to predict, and changes in the society 
will be unimaginable. 
  This leader pointed out that the reform in 1994 indeed has 
to 
be put to a very important position. If the reform in 1994 
cannot be carried out well, we will miss an historic 
opportunity, which will hardly come again in the future. If we 
can carry out the reform well, completely solve problems arising 
from it, and really embark upon the road of sustained, rapid, 
and healthy development, then, conditions will be good; we must 
cherish this good pattern, situation, and opportunity, really 
work solidly for eight or 10 years, then, China can really be 
counted as a strong nation in the world. Of course this is not 
judged in terms of per capita figure, but in terms of overall 
quantity, which will show a relatively strong national strength.

  [Text] Beijing, 25 Jan (XINHUA) -- The State General 
Administration of Taxation today issued a circular stressing the 
need to strengthen the management of taxation laws and that 
compilations of taxation laws must not be published without 
permission. 
  The circular said: Recently, some publication units and 
individuals have published compilations of taxation laws and 
regulations in violation of the State Council's regulations on 
the publication of compilations of laws and regulations; or have 
published videotapes and books on taxation in the name of 
publicizing the new taxation law and with the purpose of seeking 
exorbitant profits; or even have held training classes on 
taxation issues using the name of the State General 
Administration of Taxation. These classes asked for a large fee 
and provided low-quality lectures, causing very bad influences. 
  In response to the aforementioned situations, the State 
General Administration of Taxation recently issued a circular 
stressing: The right to construe taxation laws belongs to the 
Finance Ministry, the State General Administration of Taxation, 
or other authorized departments. Without the permission of the 
State General Administration of Taxation or other authorized 
departments, no publication units are allowed to publish any 
compilations of taxation laws. The State General Administration 
of Taxation will hand over cases of violation to a publication 
administration department or a industry and commerce 
administration department for legal action. Taxation organs and 
personnel are not allowed to take part in profit-seeking 
publication of any kind of videotape or book on taxation, or 
take part in any profit-seeking training activities concerning 
taxation law. If necessary, taxation organs and personnel may 
join concerned departments in banning such publication and 
training activities.

  [Text] Beijing, January 31 (XINHUA) -- The Ministry of 
Finance today made a public offering of 10 billion yuan in 
one-year state treasury bonds. 
  This is the second group of state bonds issued this year. 
The first issuance of five billion yuan in six-month bonds 
occurred a week ago, on January 23. 
  Both offerings are in the paperless form, that is, the 
purchase, trading or interest payment on the bonds will be done 
through computer networks of the Shanghai Stock Exchange. 
  The one-year bonds carry an interest rate of 11.98 percent 
while the rate on half-year bonds is 9.8 percent, one percentage 
point higher than the bank deposit rates for the corresponding 
periods. 
  The 15 billion yuan in bonds have all been sold to 35 
primary 
dealers, namely banks and non-banking financial institutions, 
according to an official with the Ministry of Finance. 
  This year's issuance is two months earlier than usual, and 
the short-term bond is being tested for the first time in China. 
  The early issuance is mainly intended to lay the groundwork 
for the central bank's open market operation, which will 
formally begin in early March in Shanghai. 
  It will also help to cover the huge financial expenditure 
during the peak time of Spring Festival, which falls on February 
10 this year, the financial official noted. 
  The bonds can be held by banks, enterprises and individuals. 
However, the Shanghai Stock Exchange can only open accounts for 
individuals who buy at least 10,000 yuan worth of bonds. 
  But the state will soon set up a treasury bond fund for the 
convenience of small investors, he said. 
  He said the total amount of this year's state bonds will be 
discussed and approved by the National People's Congress in 
March. 
  Nonetheless, more than 70 percent of this year's total 
issuance will be conducted in paperless bonds. 
  The state will still issue some amount of paper-note bonds, 
mostly in three-year and five-year terms to sell in small cities 
and towns which cannot be covered by the computer networks in 
the Shanghai Stock Exchange, as well as in rural areas.

<F P=106> [XINHUA Mailbox: "What are Joint Stock Limited Companies </F>
and Limited Liability Companies?"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 25 Jan (XINHUA) -- A joint stock limited 
company is a business corporation whose registered capital 
comprises shares of equal value. The company raises capital 
through the issuance of shares (or stock certificates). 
Stockholders assume limited liability for the company in 
proportion to their share subscriptions, and the company pledges 
all its assets in assuming responsibility for its debt. 
  A joint stock limited company's basic traits follow: Its 
total capital is divided into shares of equal value, with the 
stockholders assuming limited liability for the company in 
proportion to their share subscriptions. The company may issue 
shares to the public, and the shares can be traded or 
transferred. Although the number of stockholders may not fall 
short of the specified number, there is no upper limit. 
Stockholders enjoy the company's rights and assume obligations 
by virtue of their stock holdings. The company must release its 
accounting statements, reviewed and verified by a certified 
public accountant, on schedule. 
  A joint stock limited company is the typical form of a joint 
stock company. Its first advantage is that it is conducive to 
attracting capital. It may issue shares to raise capital, and 
its shares are negotiable. Specifically, it may issue various 
types of shares to lure investors, as well as shares of small 
face values to attract some idle, small-sum capital from 
society. This will expand the sources of capital for the joint 
stock limited company, which can quickly raise a huge sum of 
capital for use in large-scale operations. Second, when the 
company goes into bankruptcy, the stockholders will not be 
encumbered beyond the scope of their share subscriptions. This 
is because the company implements a limited liability system. 
This helps protect stockholders' interests. Third, a joint 
stock limited company is the typical capital partnership, whose 
ownership and management are separated. It can be managed by 
specifically trained and experienced professionals. This helps 
improve managerial level and efficiency. Moreover, a joint 
stock limited company's large numbers of shares and stockholders 
make it easy to control small amounts of capital with large 
amounts of capital. Nevertheless, a joint stock limited company 
also has its own shortcomings. First, a joint stock limited 
company must go through an elaborate process of incorporation. 
It can ill afford to maintain its confidentiality because it 
must release information on its financial status on a regular 
basis. Second, stockholders are highly mobile, and the company 
can hardly control them. In buying shares, stockholders largely 
do so for their dividends and lack a sense of responsibility to 
the company. 
  A joint stock limited company should be incorporated 
according to the "Company Law." 
  A limited liability company is a business corporation 
jointly 
funded by two or more stockholders. Each stockholder assumes 
limited liability for the company in proportion to his or her 
capital contributions, whereas the company pledges all its 
assets in assuming responsibility for its debt. 
  A limited liability company's basic traits follow: The 
company's assets are composed of several portions but are not 
divided into shares of equal value. The company issues capital 
contribution certificates, instead of shares, to stockholders. 
Stockholders' capital contributions can be transferred, but any 
transfer must be effected according to specific rules. The 
number of stockholders may not surpass a certain level. 
Stockholders enjoy various rights and undertake various 
obligations by virtue of their capital contributions. 
  Limited liability companies came into existence relatively 
late. It was only until the mid-19th century that one such 
company came into being in Britain, in the form of a "private 
company," and this was approximately 250 years after the world's 
first joint stock limited company -- the British East India 
Company -- was established in 1600. Because of its traits as 
both a capital partnership or a partnership between individuals, 
a limited liability company is a very suitable form for 
incorporating small and medium enterprises. A limited liability 
company cannot issue its shares to the public, and it is known 
as a "private company" in Britain and a "closed company" in the 
United States.

<F P=106> ["Dispatch" by staff reporter Chen Chien-ping (7115 1696 </F>
1627): "As Problems on Mainland Market Gradually Become 
Conspicuous, Central Authorities Adopt Measures to Prevent 
Crisis"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 26 Jan (WEN WEI PO)--According to an 
authoritative source here, the central leadership maintained: 
Since July last year, thanks to the adoption of stringent 
measures to energetically rectify the financial order, the 
problem of funds has been gradually alleviated. However, the 
problem of market has begun to raise its head remarkably. It is 
expected that for a period of time to come, the problem of 
market will become more conspicuous than that of funds. The 
central authorities will make plans to solve the problem to 
avoid a market crisis which may possibly occur. 
  The authoritative source said: As the central authorities 
saw it, the robustness of the domestic market in the previous 
period of time was largely a result of man-made price hikes. 
For example, the robustness in the car market was such a case. 
On the one hand, vehicles were purchased with public money, and 
on the other hand, foreign-invested enterprises upgraded their 
vehicles one after another by making use of preferential 
policies. Hence, there was a service-life cycle of 5 to 10 
years. Moreover, the mainland pursues a control policy over car 
purchases and as a result, car prices have stood at a high 
level, thus landing China's car industry in a predicament. 
Again, take the consumption market for example. From 1992 to 
1993, there was extreme unfairness in distribution on the 
mainland. Consequently, commodity demand was generated by 
upstarts, and the entire society's expenses characterized by 
high wages and bonuses driven by such demand were not 
sustainable. Moreover, domestically there was also unfairness 
in distribution between different trades, enterprises, 
departments, and even wage earners. A considerable number of 
poor counties in our country are unable to pay out wages. The 
price scissors of agricultural and sideline products are 
widening. Therefore, the robust consumption market will surely 
cool off. 
  Based on an analysis of the market prospects, the central 
leadership suggested: 
  1. It is necessary from now on to closely watch and study 
the market problem and adopt prompt measures to solve it. The 
injection of funds must be made after taking on board changes in 
the market. Otherwise, if we still increase input when the 
market has already gone down, it will end up in stockpiling of 
products and it will difficult to avoid sharp fluctuations in 
the economy. 
  2. Enterprises must make great efforts to improve 
themselves, change the way they operate, raise product quality, 
increase product varieties, and pay close attention to 
scientific and technological development and technological 
transformation. Construction banks and industrial and 
commercial banks must ensure enterprise technological funds. 
  3. Great stress should be placed on readjusting the price 
policy and developing markets. Prices of domestic products such 
as television sets, washing machines, and refrigerators can be 
cut a little to achieve larger sales at a smaller profit. Taxes 
on some products can be reduced. The price problem should be 
resolved in accordance with the laws governing the market rather 
than by rushing headlong into mass action. 
  4. Examination and approval procedures for controls over the 
purchase of domestic limousines should be scraped. We must 
consider cutting the selling prices of domestic vehicles. 
  5. Enterprise should make vigorous efforts to export more 
goods and develop both domestic and international markets. To 
promote export, apart from prohibiting enterprises to engage in 
real estate and stock trading at a profit, we must ensure the 
need of funds for the Bank of China to purchase foreign exchange. 
  6. The growth rates of township and town enterprises should 
be scaled down. Now township and town enterprises are keeping 
too many products in stock. We should no longer support them in 
turning out unsalable products blindly. Township and town 
enterprises must pay attention to industrial structural 
readjustments and product variety and quality. When it has 
surpluses in procurement funds, an agricultural bank must 
support township and town enterprises in carrying out 
technological transformation and scientific and technological 
development to readjust the industrial structure. 
  7. Labor prices call for attention. To make labor more 
appealing to foreign investors, it is necessary to bring the 
strong point of domestic labor being relatively cheap into play. 
Now a relatively too rapid labor wage increase has become a 
trend in some coastal regions. Too high wages will hamper our 
competitiveness in developing an export-oriented economy.

<F P=106> [By Li Zhurun and Ni Siyi] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, February 1 (XINHUA) -- China will take at 
least five years or longer to open its futures market to the 
outside world, a leading Chinese futures trader said today. 
  "Only after the legal framework for the futures market is in 
shape, financial reforms are carried out and China's economic 
strength substantially enhanced, will the country be ready to 
open up its futures market," said Lu Jian, president of the 
China International Futures Co. Ltd (CIFCO). 
  He explained that futures trading involves high risks and 
high profits, which require solid economic and legal foundations. 
  The country's current policy to bar overseas traders from 
entry into the country's futures market is not intended to close 
it, but to prepare for its opening up at the earliest possible 
date, Lu said. 
  According to CIFCO estimates, China's futures trade reached 
1.3 to 1.5 million deals last year, compared with 200,000 deals 
in 1992. 
  However, the number is only tiny when compared with 
developed 
countries, Lu Jian said, noting that nearly 400 million futures 
deals were made in the United States last year. 
  He compared China's futures industry to a "sampan", and the 
industry in developed countries to a "gigantic ship." 
  "How can the gigantic ship be allowed to sail in China when 
the country has yet to dig the channel?" he said. 
  China now stresses "an active but safe approach" in 
developing its futures market. 
  A government regulation for the country's futures operation 
is expected to be issued before April this year, and Lu said 
that "to his knowledge" the futures law is in the making. 
  He said a nationwide futures craze emerged last year when 
too 
many trading companies and commodity centers were set up. Some 
profiteering merchants from outside the chinese mainland took 
advantage of the confusion to drain off Chinese revenue. 
  This led to massive waste and several unusual financial 
frauds in the country, Lu Jian said. 
  Disorder in the country's futures market obstructs entry of 
trading companies or clients with high credibility, Lu said. 
  As a pilot futures company, CIFCO is the only Chinese 
company 
to have bought broker's seats in the three largest commodity 
exchange centers in the U.S. and also in the world: The Chicago 
Board of Trade, the Commodity Exchange Inc of New York and the 
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
  It is also one of the 160 futures trading companies 
qualified 
in the country's just finished reshuffle of futures trading 
companies and exchange centers. 
  The CIFCO president said he is optimistic about the 
development of China's futures market, since its functions to 
find prices and avoid risks will be of importance for China's 
market economy. 
  "It will also help to link China's economy with that of the 
world," he said. 
  Lu said the volume of China's futures trading will continue 
to rise, in line with the healthy development of China's economy. 
  State-imposed prices are being cancelled as part of China's 
market-oriented economic reform, prompting enterprises to 
safeguard the value of products by engaging in futures trading, 
Lu said. 
  The better equipped futures organizations and well trained 
personnel will also stimulate the rise in trading volume, he 
said. 
  Dr. Lu Jian, 39, an Oxford educated economist, is a renowned 
management expert in the futures trade in China. He conducted 
intensive and extensive investigation and research work on major 
futures organizations in the U.S., the U.K. and Hong Kong.

<F P=106> [By Zhang Yuan] </F>
  [Text] The market in consumer goods has been fluctuating 
since November, with the prices of some commodities rising 
drastically. Some consumers have not fully understood the 
implementation of tax reforms, and fear the new tax system will 
further add to inflation. 
  Sales in major shopping malls in Beijing and Wuhan have been 
rising with consumers' favourite commodities including grain, 
oil, electric appliances and gold. Sales of television sets, 
video cassette recorders, refrigerators and washing machines 
went up by 100 to 200 percent. 
  However, the demand for less than nine percent of the 
commodities outstripped supply, and it is not difficult to 
stabilise the market. Consumers also only look for a small range 
of commodities and the impact of price fluctuations on the 
market has not proved particularly serious. 
  But market fluctuations show that consumers are still 
expecting inflation will continue in the near future. They want 
to buy goods because they believe that devaluation of money is 
faster than that of commodities. They fear the introduction of 
tax reforms and further liberalisation of price controls this 
year will lead to a surge in prices. 
  Although consumers are flocking to stores, they are not 
buying whatever commodities can be found on the market. They 
are proving to be selective, and only want to buy goods with 
brand names and of good quality. This might put additional 
pressure on inflation as demand for imported products will go up.

  [Text] Beijing, 20 Jan (XINHUA) -- Civil liabilities are a 
kind of legal responsibility, as well as the legal consequences, 
of violating civil statutes. Therefore, they possess traits of 
both legal responsibilities and their own. 
  Civil liabilities possess the following legal traits: 1) 
Civil liabilities are enforced by state compulsory measures. 
Compulsory enforcement by the state is an important feature of 
legal responsibilities, as well as civil liabilities. This is a 
major difference between civil liabilities and moral 
obligations. 2) Civil liabilities are legal responsibilities 
arising from failure to perform civil obligations in violation 
of the demands of the Civil Law. Civil liabilities differ from 
civil obligations; civil liabilities are not civil obligations 
but the legal consequences of not performing such obligations. 
In other words, civil liabilities are predicated on civil 
obligations. 3) Civil liabilities are mainly responsibilities 
regarding property. It is the common task for laws governing 
various activities, as well as a task for the Civil Law, to 
protect socialist public property and the legitimate rights and 
interests of citizens and legal entities. Nevertheless, 
protection measures under the Civil Law possess traits different 
from those of laws governing other activities. This fact 
determines the Civil Law's scope and principles. 4) Citizens 
and legal entities are encouraged to conscientiously perform 
their civil obligations and fight against lawbreaking acts. 
  Civil liabilities can be divided into two major categories: 
contractual and tortious liabilities. Contractual liabilities, 
also called liabilities arising from contractual violations, 
mean civil liabilities that should be undertaken by the parties 
who violate contracts. Tortious liabilities, also called 
liabilities arising from causing people harm, mean civil 
liabilities that should be undertaken by the parties who 
infringe on state and collectively owned property, as well as 
the property and persons of other people. 
  There are four general principles governing civil 
liabilities: 1) The principle of protecting the legitimate civil 
rights and interests of civil rights principals. This principle 
calls for holding any unit or individual civilly liable for 
infringing on other people's civil rights and legitimate rights 
and interests. 2) The principle of fixing responsibility for 
errors. This is the principle of assigning civil liabilities, 
which holds the performer of an act civilly liable for his or 
her erroneous act. 3) The principle of fairness in assigning 
responsibility. It urges people's courts to seek truth from 
facts, show fairness and reasonableness, and abide by the law in 
handling civil cases. Courts should uphold the principle of 
fixing responsibility for errors without unduly focusing on the 
errors. They should consider the interests of both parties and 
correctly handle civil disputes so as to enhance harmony and 
unity between the parties and benefit their production and 
lives. 4) The principle of exoneration as a consequence of 
force majeure. Except otherwise provided for by law, the 
parties concerned are absolved from responsibility for not 
honoring contracts or causing other people harm as a consequence 
of force majeure.

  [Text] Beijing, 30 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Qian 
Guanlin, director of the Chinese Customs Administration, said 
here today that Chinese Customs will continue to earnestly 
perform its anti-smuggling functions and continue to sternly 
crack down on smuggling. 
  Over the past year, Chinese Customs has sternly attacked 
smuggling activities, recovering over 2.346 billion yuan of 
smuggled goods and turning over 1.777 billion yuan of penalties 
and confiscated money, an increase of 78 percent and 83 percent, 
respectively over the previous year. 
  In view of the characteristics of smuggling activities under 
the conditions of reform, opening up, and a socialist market 
economy this year, Qian Guanlin said, the investigation bureau 
of the Customs Administration will directly organize and take 
part in the investigation and handling of complicated major 
cases, which involve a huge value and which transcend regions. 
  To adopt forceful measures against the illegal activities of 
smuggling, Qian said, we should gradually set up a highly 
centralized sea-land-air national headquarters against smuggling 
and establish a national customs information system within 
Customs, which is connected with law enforcement organs and 
information departments. We should strengthen the antismuggling 
functions of Customs, closely follow marine and border smuggling 
activities, and resolutely crack down on smuggling. 
  On the supervision over import and export commodities 
restricted by the state, Qian Guanlin said, dutiable commodities 
without license should be returned or confiscated according to 
law or sold at current prices strictly in light of regulations. 
It is necessary to strengthen supervision over the rare species 
and controlled commodities, punish the illegal transfer of 
textiles, strictly enforce regulations, and safeguard the 
state's interests.

<F P=106> [By Paul Mooney] </F>
  [Text] Ever since China's patriarch, Deng Xiaoping, kicked 
off his economic reform campaign two years ago, foreign 
companies have been pouring into the country hoping to tap its 
billion-plus consumer market. Hard on their heels, however, is 
a fast-growing army of counterfeiters who are pulling in 
hundreds of millions of dollars while local officials look the 
other way. 
  Take the case of Microsoft. In October 1991, the US software 
manufacturer was shocked to discover counterfeit copies of its 
hologram appearing up and down the American West Coast. Company 
officials had thought the hologram -- a sophisticated reflective 
sticker used to authenticate products -- was almost impossible 
to duplicate. 
  After months of detective work, the fakes were traced to an 
unexpected source: the Shenzhen Reflective Materials Institute 
at Shenzhen University in southern China. The institute was 
raided the following March by the Shenzhen Administration of 
Industry and Commerce (AIC), which found contracts and materials 
that suggested the institute had received an order for 3 million 
holograms. Almost two years later, many questions remain. "The 
AIC did a very good raid, it was excellent," Alix Parlour, 
corporate attorney for Microsoft, said. "But it's been downhill 
since then." 
  Despite numerous meetings with the Shenzhen branch of the 
AIC, she said, the Chinese had failed to provide Microsoft with 
information they have about a Taiwanese company involved in the 
case. Microsoft still has no idea where the moulds used to make 
the holograms are, or, more importantly, if they are still in 
use. 
  Company officials are not sure why the Chinese are dragging 
their feet, but Parlour offered the following speculation. 
"There's always the dismal prospect that someone at the 
university is well-connected and can protect the institute," she 
said. Many counterfeiters are state enterprises, collectives, 
or village or township enterprises. "Officials say, `Hey, these 
are my factories, I'm not going to put these guys out of 
business'," a Hong Kong-based trade official said. 
  One leading provincial official in the south of China told a 
US trade official that he would only intervene on behalf of 
foreign manufacturers producing in his province. Experts agree 
that the State Administration for Industry and Commerce -- which 
deals with trademark infringements -- is serious about cracking 
down on pirates. 
  Unfortunately, the state organisation's local branches, 
understaffed and lacking resources and political clout, often 
prove unable or unwilling to take action. Local AIC branches 
are particularly careful when dealing with big counterfeiters 
with powerful connections. "Sometimes the AIC will carry out a 
raid right away," Joseph Simone, a lawyer with Johnson Stokes 
and Master who advises on intellectual property law, said. "But 
often they will first do a political background check to see who 
the counterfeiter is. Some people have gone to jail for going 
after the wrong factory." 
  In some cases, money can move the AIC to action. Foreign 
companies report being asked to "contribute" funds to set up 
special teams to raid infringers. The head of one industry 
association said his organisation was asked for US$250,000 
(about HK$1.95m). 
  Patrick Wong, executive secretary of the Hong Kong office of 
the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, said 
that while China had the capacity to turn out 62 million compact 
discs a year, its actual consumption was 2-3 million. The rest, 
says the former Hong Kong policeman, ended up in Hong Kong, 
Taiwan, Southeast Asia, Canada and the US. 
  Although the organisation, which represents recording 
artists 
around the world, provided Chinese officials with the names and 
locations of about a dozen factories that were illegally 
reproducing CDs and handed over funds for a task force, when the 
AIC finally carried out raids it was against shops in Shenzhen 
and not the well connected factories manufacturing tens of 
millions of CDs. 
  And getting the AIC to carry out a raid does not necessarily 
end a company's problems. Although foreign companies are 
generally permitted to send a representative along on raids, not 
all AICs allow this. When the AIC raided three companies 
pirating Walt Disney products in Guangdong province last year, 
the American company was not allowed to participate in the raid, 
raising doubts about what was actually seized and what has 
happened to the factories. "We'll only believe it when we can 
go on a raid and see (the offender) shut down and say `ouch'," 
John Feenie, executive vice-president Asia Pacific for Walt 
Disney, said. 
  Some foreigners also suspect that AIC officials tip off 
violators before a raid can be organised. To prevent this, 
Steven McVeigh, Hong Kong manager for Pinkerton Consulting and 
Investigations Services, said the company sometimes stationed 
employees outside factories even before it approached the AIC. 
  Simone estimates that some big companies should budget as 
much as US$500,000 to cover the cost of private investigators, 
lawyers and in-house staff. But, he added, few companies were 
earning enough in China to justify such an expense. And even 
when a company succeeds in uncovering an infringer, justice is 
not always done. 
  Criminal punishments are rarely handed down and only in 
trademark cases. It is difficult to get compensation and fines 
are too low to be a deterrent. In the case of Microsoft, it 
took the AIC two years to fine the offender and the fine was 
HK$2,000. 
  Some frustrated companies have abandoned the legal road for 
more direct methods. This often results in what Simone 
described as "an unhealthy reliance" on establishing guanxi, or 
connections. One foreign law firm that has handled 
intellectual-property cases through its offices in China has 
retired Chinese judges on its staff.

  [Text] Beijing, 18 Jan (XINHUA) -- Interim Procedures on 
the Administration of Import Quotas for General Commodities 
(approved by the State Council on 22 December 1993 and 
promulgated by the State Planning Commission and the Ministry of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation on 29 December 1993) 
  Article 1 These procedures are formulated to promote the 
development of our country's economy and foreign trade, to meet 
the need of establishing a socialist market economic structure, 
and to further reform and improve the import management system. 
  Article 2 According to the state industrial policy and plans 
for the development of various trades, the state will enforce 
the quota system in line with international customs for certain 
commodities imported to meet domestic needs and to adjust market 
supply; but the import of those commodities in excess quantity 
may seriously obstruct the development of related industries in 
our country, which may directly influence the adjustment of 
import and production structures, and which may endanger the 
state's foreign exchange stabilization. 
  Article 3 The general commodities mentioned in these 
procedures are all commodities which need to be controlled by 
import quotas with the exception of mechano-electrical products. 
  Article 4 The State Planning Commission will be in charge of 
macrocontrol and coordination of import quotas for general 
commodities according to the national economic development plan 
and the state industrial policy. The State Planning Commission 
may forward opinions in coordination with other concerned 
departments on adjustment of categories of general commodities 
to be controlled by import quotas and the change will be 
announced and implemented after State Council approval. 
  Article 5 The total annual import quota for a general 
commodity will be suggested by the State Planning Commission in 
coordination with concerned departments according to the state's 
foreign exchange situation, the need for industrial and 
agricultural production at home, market demand, and the need for 
state security and environmental protection. After State 
Council approval, the total amount will be included in the 
annual national economic and social development plan. The State 
Planning Commission will allocate the amount to various units 
according to the actual economic development situation and 
production and construction needs in various localities and 
departments. 
  Article 6 Under State Planning Commission guidance, various 
provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities and cities with 
independent economic decision-making authority, and 
administrative organizations designated by concerned departments 
of the State Council ("regional and departmental organizations 
for the administration of import quotas for general commodities" 
will be used in following articles for short) will be in charge 
of the management and coordination of import quotas for general 
commodities in their respective localities and departments, will 
make a consolidated study on the need for import quotas for 
general commodities in their respective localities and 
departments, and will submit a balanced report to the State 
Planning Commission. Within the amount of quota allocated by 
the State Planning Commission, they will examine the 
applications for import quotas from various enterprises under 
the jurisdiction of those localities and departments. 
  Article 7 Enterprises which need import quotas of general 
commodities (productive and other enterprises which have been 
approved by the state for registration with industrial and 
commercial departments and have legal person status) should make 
applications to regional and departmental organizations for the 
administration of import quotas for general commodities. 
  Article 8 When applying for an import quota for general 
commodities, an enterprise shall report to the relevant 
department for the administration of import quotas for general 
commodities relevant data such as the use of the quota, payment 
ability, and actual quota fulfillment in the previous year. 
  Article 9 Upon receiving an application from an enterprise, 
a department administrating import quotas for general 
commodities shall, in line with the number of quotas issued by 
the State Planning Commission, examine and verify the 
enterprise's use of an import quota and its import payment 
ability, and issue a certificate of import quota to the 
enterprise in accordance with its actual production and 
operational ability and by referring to the amount of quota 
issued to it the previous year. In case an import quota is not 
to be issued, the organ for administrating import quotas for 
general commodities of a region or a department shall, within 20 
days, notify the enterprise applying for an import quota. 
  Article 10 Effective seals used on certificates of import 
quotas for general commodities shall be the "special seals for 
import quotas for general commodities" issued by the State 
Planning Commission. 
  Article 11 After receiving an import quota certificate from 
a quota administrative organ, authorized import enterprises may 
operate independently; those not authorized to engage in 
importing may conduct their dealings with foreign countries by 
entrusting authorized foreign trade enterprises. On the basis 
of import quota certificates, enterprises shall apply for an 
import permit with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation [MOFTEC] or its designated permit-issuing organs. 
Customs shall conduct its inspections on the basis of import 
permits. 
  Article 12 General commodities imported for processing and 
re- exporting enterprises and transshipment enterprises shall be 
subject to quota control; customs shall supervise the 
importation of these commodities in accordance with relevant 
provisions. 
  Article 13 General commodities which are imported by foreign 
investment enterprises as their investment but which are subject 
to quota control shall be handled in accordance with existing 
state investment laws and regulations. General commodities 
which are imported for the manufacture of products to be 
marketed domestically but which are subject to quota control 
shall be included in the national plan for the total amount of 
commodities to be subject to import quota control and 
administered by the MOFTEC according to existing state laws and 
regulations. 
  Article 14. For general commodities which are to be imported 
as gifts but which are subject to import quota control, their 
import formalities shall be handled in accordance with relevant 
state provisions, in accordance with the subordinate 
relationship of the receiving units, and on the basis of these 
procedures, following approval by a competent department. 
  Article 15 For general commodities which are to be imported 
with loans from foreign governments or international monetary 
organizations but which are subject to import quota control, 
their import formalities shall be handled in accordance with the 
subordinate relationship of the project contracting units and on 
the basis of these procedures. 
  Article 16 Should any of the following situations occur, 
importing units shall be regarded as violating these procedures: 
1) signing contracts with foreign firms for the delivery of 
goods without applying for an import quota certificate in 
accordance with these procedures; 2) arbitrarily altering or 
forging import quota certificates; 3) arbitrarily transferring 
or selling import quota certificates for profit; or 4) violating 
the "Interim PRC Regulations Governing the Permit System for 
Imported Goods." 
  Article 17 Violators of these procedures shall be handled by 
customs in accordance with the "PRC Customs Law" and the "PRC 
Rules for the Implementation of the Customs Law Concerning 
Administrative Punishment." If the circumstances are 
particularly serious, violators of the law shall be made 
accountable for their criminal responsibility according to the 
law. 
  Article 18 Import administrative personnel who have 
neglected their duty, practiced favoritism or fraud, or abused 
their power shall, depending on the seriousness of their 
offense, be meted out administrative punishment by supervisory 
departments, and shall be made accountable for their criminal 
responsibility if they have violated the law. 
  Article 19 The State Planning Commission shall be 
responsible for interpreting these procedures and for organizing 
their implementation. 
  Article 20 The provisions of these procedures shall apply if 
past relevant provisions are in conflict with their provisions. 
These procedures shall go into effect on 1 January 1994.

  [Text] Shenyang, February 1 (XINHUA) -- A nationwide 
information network has taken shape in China, according to a 
senior official at a recent symposium. 
  Wu Jiapei, deputy director of the State Information Center, 
said that China should seize the chance to develop the 
information market during the current reform drive. 
  Now a vast number of institutions offer information 
services. 
At the least, there are 12,000 professionals in the state-run 
economic information system, which has branched into the 
country's 30 provinces, metropolises and autonomous regions. 
  Statistics show that Shanghai, China's largest industrial 
city, boasts over 5,000 information organs, six-fold the number 
for 1991. Information departments have been set up in almost all 
industries. 
  Moreover, information exchanges have increased. For example, 
trading volume reached 24.51 million yuan at an information 
meeting in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province last year. 
  An expert from the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences said 
that China's reform drive has resulted in a soaring demand for 
information, which is considered key for companies to outpace 
their rivals. 
  The information institutions also have to improve themselves 
to survive in tough competition. 
  Many of them have provided specialized information, with 
some 
becoming authoritative consultants in certain industries. 
  Meanwhile, more advanced equipment has quickened information 
delivery. 
  With the development of the economic information market, 
legislation has topped the agenda in the field, with a set of 
national regulations in the making. 
  North China's Hebei Province was the first in the country to 
formulate and enforce a set of regulations on the economic 
information market last December. 
  Wu said there is still much room for improvement, as most 
information currently offered is regional and far from 
comprehensive.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan. 31 KYODO -- Economic experts are 
calling on the government to hold a fire sale of all or part of 
the nearly two-thirds of state-run enterprises which are 
burdening the national economy with losses, state press reported 
Monday [31 January]. 
  "In 1988 the amount of enterprises losing money was about 10 
percent. Now with the new system of accounting, more than two- 
thirds of the enterprises have both clear and hidden losses," 
the CHINA BUSINESS TIMES reported. 
  "The state economy while taking up 70 percent of current 
loans and more than 70 percent of fixed asset investments only 
account for 20 to 30 percent of the country's gross production 
value and make up only 42 percent of the national economy," the 
report said. 
  "The reform of state-run enterprises is a main battle front 
in this year's comprehensive reform program which will aim at 
attacking issues dealing with property rights," delegates were 
reported as saying at a Shenzhen meeting. 
  The meeting was being held to commemorate paramount leader 
Deng Xiaoping's famous "southern tour" in 1992, which spurred 
China's economy to 13 percent growth rates over the last two 
years. 
  Yang Qi of the Research Committee under the State Commission 
for the Restructuring of the Economy, called on every level of 
government to quickly auction off small state-run enterprises or 
implement shareholding or public ownership reforms, the report 
said. 
  Yang also called on medium-sized state-run enterprises to 
quickly change into a system of mixed ownership, by attracting 
diverse funds through all channels, while some medium and large 
enterprises must become standard corporations, it said. 
  Wang Jue of the Central Party School said state-run 
enterprises in urban areas must change into a mixed ownership 
system and principal property rights should be diversified. 
  Chinese leaders have called 1994 an important year in 
reforming the centrally planned economy. 
  The reform of state-run enterprises, which could mean taking 
away cradle-to-grave benefits and laying off parts of a huge 
work force, seems to be an almost impossible task.

<F P=106> ["Special Dispatch" by special correspondent Liu Chun (0491 </F>
5028): "China Encourages Chinese and Foreign Businessmen To 
Purchase Poorly Managed State-Owned Enterprises"] 
  [Text] Shanghai 27 Jan (WEN WEI PO)--To resolve the 
problem of numerous large and medium-sized state-own enterprises 
on the verge of bankruptcy, the state has already considered 
adopting a preferential policy to encourage foreign or Chinese 
businessmen to purchase them, or be equity participants in 
state-owned enterprises; the key would be transferring part of 
the property rights of some poorly managed state-owned 
enterprises to overseas financial groups to realize management 
by a holding company with foreign investment; in addition, a 
"state-owned enterprise reinvigorating fund' would be set up to 
support those enterprises with outstanding accomplishments to 
purchase bankrupt enterprises, a State Economic and Trade 
Commission official disclosed to reporters not long ago. 
  According to this official, property rights of state-owned 
enterprises being transferred to overseas financial groups must 
first go through strict examination; the liabilities of the 
former state-owned enterprise would be taken up by the 
enterprise that becomes a joint-venture. On this point, the 
state was planning to adopt a series of preferential polices 
including preferential treatment in the charge for transfer of 
land use right. 
  The sources of the "state-owned enterprises reinvigorating 
fund" would be mainly the original bank subsidy loans, 
proceedings from disposal of property, and international aid; 
this fund would be used in purchases between enterprises from 
now on. 
  Besides this, the state would establish and promote a 
"bankruptcy warning system," which would be used to standardize 
a bank mortgage insurance system; it was stipulated that from 
now on administrative organizations were not allowed to be 
guarantors of enterprise loans, and the guarantee between 
enterprises must be based on the principle of voluntariness, 
joint products, and multiple association in responsibility; this 
system should stipulate a certain index for the liability rate 
of an enterprise for it to go bankrupt. 
  This State Economic and Trade Commission official disclosed 
that the state was considering revising the "Law on Bankruptcy" 
and formulating a series of new decrees that comply with the 
modern enterprise system.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "Patent Courts To Guard Rights"] </F>
  [Text] A patent court system is planned for major cities 
to protect domestic and foreign intellectual property rights. 
  The move follows what officials call "a positive 
participation of China in the world scene" in copyrighting and 
patenting product and technological innovations. 
  One patent court was established in Haikou, Hainan Province 
last week. 
  "We'll suggest local governments open such courts at a 
proper 
time," said Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi. 
  She said China was better than the world average in 
protecting intellectual property rights, although improvement is 
needed. 
  "China is so large a country. We'll kick off nationwide 
education campaigns to promote public awareness," she said. 
  And patent courts will be an integral part of the campaigns. 
  "If violations are evident, both Chinese and foreigners can 
appeal to such courts," Wu added. 
  She urged countries like the United States to better 
understand China's situation, calling it unwise for the US to 
pressure China on its patent reforms. 
  "The United States doesn't understand what is happening with 
China," she said in response to a question on possible straining 
of Sino-US relations over the intellectual property rights issue. 
  China and the US reached a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) 
on January 16,1992 on the protection of intellectual property 
rights. 
  "China has honoured the MOU since then, a fact even 
recognized by the US," Wu said. 
  She also pointed to a series of new laws on trademarks, 
patents and copyrights. 
  According to a Xinhua report, China's trademark law conforms 
to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial 
Property, of which China is the 95th member. 
  The report said since signing the Madrid Agreement for the 
International Registration of Trademarks, about 10,000 foreign 
trademarks have been protected in China. 
  Moreover, China has signed the Berne Convention for the 
Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, and the Universal 
Copyright Convention. 
  In another development, Wu reaffirmed that Sino-British 
trade 
could hardly escape damage from "an uncooperative and unfriendly 
Britain." 
  But she noted the trade increases between the nations last 
year, which leaped 86 percent to around $3.6 billion. 
  Sino-Russian trade also experienced a boom last year to $7.7 
billion, up 31 percent over 1992. 
  Broken down, China's imports from Russia went up 41.4 
percent 
to $4.99 billion, while its exports grew 15 percent to $2.69 
billion. 
  Vice Foreign Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng said the two 
neighbours have vast potential for trade development. 
  There were 27,000 Chinese working in Russia's projects last 
year, with more than 2,000 Chinese enterprises set up there with 
$82 million in investment.

  [Text] Beijing, 20 Jan (XINHUA) -- The just-concluded 1993 
saw progress in the construction sector, including engineering, 
urban and rural construction, building, real estate, and urban 
public utilities. 
  Addressing the national construction work meeting today, 
Construction Minister Hou Jie summarized achievements in 
nationwide construction undertakings last year: 
  -- Engineering construction achieved notable results with 
building industry steadily developing. A host of key projects, 
including Shanghai's Yangpu Bridge, Guangdong's Dayawan Nuclear 
Power Station, second-phase Dalian-Qinhuangdao electric railway 
project, and Jinan-Qindao Expressway, have successively 
completed and commenced operations. The introduction of an 
engineering construction supervision system has brought high 
speed, quality, and efficiency. 
  -- Adaption to the new situation has brought new progress in 
urban planning. To meet demands of a new reform situation and 
the establishment of a socialist market economic system, various 
localities embarked on revising the overall urban planning last 
year by speeding up formulation of detailed rules designed to 
better control and guide development of new zones, 
reconstruction of old areas, and construction of various 
development sites in urban areas. The revised overall urban 
planning for both Beijing and Changsha have been approved by the 
State Council, while initial examinations of that of Nanjing, 
Xian, Hangzhou, and Shenyang have completed. The formulation of 
transcentury overall urban planning has begun. 
  -- New successes secured in urban construction included an 
additional water supply capacity of 6 million tons per day, gas 
supply capacity of 1.6 million cubic meters, waste water 
treatment capacity of 800,000 tons, and completed highways 
totaling 30 million square meters. Urban public transportation, 
particularly car- renting, has been developing rapidly. The 
construction of overpasses one over the other has become the 
feature of urban communications. 
  -- Another new record was set in urban and rural housing 
construction last year with the completion of more than 900,000 
square meters throughout the country. The special housing 
policy adopted by the Construction Ministry designed to solve 
housing problems has not only relieved housing shortage and 
replaced dilapidated houses, but also has boosted nationwide 
housing construction. 
  -- The construction of villages and towns has entered a new 
phase. The development of rural economy and the relatively 
concentrated development of village and town enterprises have 
accelerated the development pace of small towns, which in turn 
have brought overall development to adjacent small villages. 
  Hou Jie pointed out: While witnessing the strong development 
in construction undertakings, we should also pay attention to 
the solution of contradictions and problems. The ongoing 
large-scale construction has brought new challenges to urban 
planning and management, with certain localities placing 
preference of construction over urban planning. In particular, 
certain localities, being too eager to attract foreign funds for 
quick success and instant benefit, have blindly leased out lands 
without planning and incurred losses. For problems like serious 
fund shortage for both urban and rural construction, poor 
infrastructure, work quality, and frequent accidents, their 
solution needs unremitting efforts.

  [Text] Beijing, January 31 (XINHUA) -- China's export of 
machinery and electronics last year hit a record high, with the 
total volume reaching 22.71 billion U.S. dollars, according to 
the latest statistics from the Customs Department. 
  The figure represents a 16.1 percent rise over the previous 
year and accounts for 24.7 percent of China's total exports. 
The growth rate is the lowest in the past few years. 
  Last year, exports of instruments for machinery and 
electronic products took up a large part. Exports of machinery 
and electronics by foreign-funded enterprises continued to grow 
at a high speed. 
  Exports of machinery and electronics which had been 
processed 
in China last year also increased much more than the general 
growth rate. 
  The United States, the European Community, Hong Kong and 
Japan are the major markets for machinery and electronics, 
covering 73 percent of the total such exports. 
  Such exports to Singapore, Pakistan, Taiwan, the Republic of 
Korea and Latin America last year also increased by a large 
margin. 
  South China's Guangdong Province was the largest exporter in 
this regard last year, and its export volume hit 13.63 billion 
U.S. dollars, an increase of 18.7 percent over the previous year 
and accounting for 60 percent of China's total export of 
machinery and electronics last year.

  [Text] Qingdao, February 1 (XINHUA) -- Economists have 
shown great interest in and approval for an initial scheme to 
construct a free port at Qingdao, a port city in east China's 
Shandong Province. 
  After inspecting Qingdao's harbor, technology development 
zone and bonded zone, economists agreed that the time was ripe 
for the construction of a free port in the city. 
  According to the initial scheme drafted by the local 
government, three steps will be taken, including improvement of 
the existing harbor-front in the coming decade, improvement of 
facilities in the technology development zone and bonded zone at 
the beginning of the next century and final establishment of a 
multi-functional free port by the year 2020. 
  Qingdao city is among the country's earliest to have been 
opened up to foreign investors and also one of the five largest 
port cities of China. 
  It is always in the forefront of the reform and opening-up 
of 
Shandong, a coastal province where the estuary of the Yellow 
River is located. 
  A switch to a free port will bring Qingdao port into full 
play and best exploit its geographic, historic and economic 
advantages in trade with neighboring Japan and the Republic of 
Korea, Germany as well as Taiwan. 
  Enormous economic profits and political benefits are 
expected 
to inland provinces along the Yellow River from the completion 
of the project. 
  It will also play a positive role in helping China to attain 
an active position in trade and economic cooperation in 
Northeast Asia, even in the whole Asia-Pacific region. 
  The scheme aims to further enlarge the opening-up of the 
Yellow River valley to match that of Zhujiang River valley in 
south China led by special economic zones such as Shenzhen, and 
the Chang Jiang river valley led by Pudong area in Shanghai, 
thus readjusting reform patterns of the country and promoting 
its all-around opening-up.

<F P=106> ["Review and Prospects" Column by staff reporter Liu Guilian </F>
(0491 2710 5571): "China's Shipbuilding Industry Heads for the 
World"] 
  [Text] When the first 100,000 metric ton steamship 
"Yaojin" built by China (China only built the hull) was launched 
in 1958, this paper described it as opening a new chapter of 
China's shipbuilding industry's history. When the first 100,000 
metric ton oceangoing freighter "Dongfeng" designed and built by 
China was checked and accepted by the government in 1968, this 
paper said China has put an end to the historical period in 
which China had to buy ships from abroad because of its 
inability to building big ships. A few days ago, Wang 
Rongsheng, president of the China State Shipbuilding 
Corporation, told this reporter that China has become a big 
shipbuilding country with its shipbuilding tonnage being among 
the highest in the world and its orders received ranking third. 
  The fact that China grew from a country that could only 
build 
small ships and had to buy ships from foreign countries to a 
country that can build big ships and exports a large number of 
ships reflects that China's shipbuilding industry has upgraded 
its products, improved product quality, and adapted itself to 
the change in external and internal markets. 
  Before 1965, China's shipbuilding industry's total 
shipbuilding capacity [zao chuan neng li 6644 5307 5174 0500] 
measured 300,000 metric tons and its annual output [nian chan 
liang 1628 3934 6852] was 80,000 metric tons. And the 80,000 
metric tons was the total tonnage of 517 [figures as published] 
ships so the tonnage of ships was very low. Before reform and 
the open policy were introduced, China had a long way to go to 
match advanced countries in shipbuilding technology because it 
basically built ships behind closed doors though it could build 
100,000 metric ton ships. 
  As China carried out reform and opening to the outside 
world, 
its shipbuilding industry introduced advanced technologies and 
equipment from abroad, and after mastering the technology 
introduced, greatly improved their designing ability, 
shipbuilding skills, and capability to manufacture the main 
engine [zhu ji 0031 2623] for ships, thus lifting China's 
shipbuilding industry to a new stage. In 1992, the China State 
Shipbuilding Corporation's output stood at 1,100,000 metric 
tons, hitting a record high. The output increased to 1,300,000 
metric tons in 1993, up 20 percent. In this period, China built 
a number of large and new types of ships using high technologies 
including container ships, big refrigerated ships, automobile 
transport ships, and liquid petroleum gas transport ships [shi 
you ye hua qi chuan 4258 3111 3210 0553 3086 5307]. These ships 
have reached advanced world level and have been put up for sale 
in the international market in turn. 
  Currently, of the over 70 types of ships exported by China, 
two thirds were designed in China and some types have found a 
ready market abroad. For instance, the 70,000 metric ton bulk 
cargo ship built by the Jiangnan Shipyard, and the 98,000 metric 
ton petroleum products cargo ship [cheng pin you lun 2052 0756 
3111 6544] built by the Dalian Shipyard are reputed as "Jiangnan 
model" and "Dalian model" respectively by international shipping 
circles. These two types of ships have been sold in the 
international market in batch quantities. China's 
ship-designing technology has also began to enter the 
international market. China-made main engines for oceangoing 
ships have been exported to Germany, Italy, the United States, 
and Japan. 
  China's shipbuilding industry vows to rank itself among 
advanced shipbuilding countries in the world by the end of this 
century. To achieve this, it is necessary to make enterprise 
reform a success in the "eighth five-year plan" to lay a sound 
foundation, to improve ship-designing expertise comprehensively, 
to better coordinate operations of relevant sectors, and to 
improve management to enable the shipbuilding industry to make 
new progress.

<F P=106> [By Chen Junsheng (7115 0193 3932): "Rural Work Should </F>
Revolve Around Increasing Peasants' Income"] 
  [Text] The central part of current agricultural, rural, 
and peasants' work is to increase peasant incomes. 
  Why should increasing peasant incomes take center stage? 
One, with adequate food and clothing, income becomes the 
peasants' greatest concern. They will abandon their farmland if 
over time farming proves unprofitable. Two, increasing the 
effective supply of agricultural products, including growth in 
total volume, structural optimization, and quality improvement, 
is necessarily related to peasant incomes. Peasants now have a 
clear idea of how much they can earn or lose from what they grow 
and breed. Increases in output without corresponding increases 
in income would do nothing to stabilize agriculture. Three, 
agricultural development in the past often ignored peasant 
market roles. One of the important reasons why we have had weak 
market demand is the failure to widen rural markets. The demand 
of some 200-million strong city population cannot possibly 
absorb the rapid growth of the entire national economy. To 
enliven rural markets, it is necessary to increase peasant 
incomes over the years. Four, by the end of this century, 
people throughout the whole country, above all peasants, should 
be enjoying relatively well-off living standards. 
  Comrade Xiaoping repeatedly stressed: "The whole political 
situation will be unstable if rural areas are unstable. Our 
country cannot be said to have eradicated poverty if it still 
exists in rural areas." Therefore, increasing peasant incomes 
is not an isolated problem, but a strategic problem concerning 
the prosperity and development of the entire national economy. 
  To increase peasant incomes more quickly, it is necessary to 
take the entire political situation into account, 
conscientiously implement the spirit of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the Central Rural 
Work Conference, and pursue the following tasks properly: 
<H5>  Increase Inputs Into Rural Areas </H5>
  Since the founding of the country, industrial development 
has 
mainly been based on a capital base built up by agriculture but 
conditions have changed. This strategy of industrial 
development based on agricultural accumulation must change. 
Adjustment should also be made in infrastructure investment, 
budgetary financial capital, and credit capital mix. 
  Leading comrades from the central committee and State 
Council 
have stressed repeatedly that the urgent needs posed by 
agricultural development must be met, even if it means 
postponing a few industrial projects. Increasing input is meant 
to correct the state of affairs wherein agriculture is getting 
far too small a proportion of input for the development of the 
entire national economy. One, increases in credit; two, an 
increase in investment in infrastructure projects; and three, 
increases in financial inputs. These are key conditions for 
maintaining agriculture as the foundation of the economy. 
<H5>  Actively Adjust Agricultural Production and Product Mix </H5>
  The crux of the problem for agricultural development is that 
it is next to impossible to reverse the trends of diminishing 
farmland and increasing populations and market demand. With 
these two nonreversals, to increase peasant incomes it is 
necessary to rationalize the use of available resources and 
continuously adjust the agricultural structure. 
  One underlying principle for adjustments in agricultural 
production and product mix is that they must be pursued while 
total grain output is steadily rising. Last year, the State 
Council announced the "Outline on China's Agricultural 
Development in the 1990's" and the "Outline on Reforms and 
Development of Food Mix in China in the 1990's," which are 
documents providing guidance for adjustments in agricultural 
production and product mix and developing high-yield, 
good-quality, high-efficiency agriculture. The central rural 
work conference convened earlier decided to pursue vigorously a 
number of models of high-yield, good-quality, high-efficiency 
agricultural zones. The State Planning Commission and 
agricultural and forestry departments have provided specific 
details for implementation. The adoption of these measures is 
aimed at speeding up adjustment in agricultural production and 
product mix. There must be efforts to invigorate agriculture 
with science and education, fully exploit modern science and 
technology, extend and apply the existing agricultural 
technologies with a view to turning them into productive forces. 
Grain and cotton breeds must be renewed and their strains and 
quality upgraded to increase returns. We must also vigorously 
develop the processing, transportation, and sales of 
agricultural products to coordinate development in the primary, 
secondary, and tertiary industries in rural areas to achieve 
added value for agricultural products and increase peasant 
incomes. 
<H3>  Enlivening the Circulation of Agricultural Products and 
Rural Markets </H3>
  1. Bring production and markets together by means of 
information and contracts. Prices for most of the agricultural 
products have been deregulated, except for a few such as cotton 
and cocoons. The main problem now is that production by 
scattered peasant households is out of touch with market demand. 
Many peasants do not know what is going on in the market and 
cannot adjust to market demand, not knowing what to produce, 
what will sell, and what can fetch good prices. Therefore, it 
is extremely necessary to provide information for peasants, 
strengthen the effort to build an agricultural product supply 
and demand information network, predict and issue bulletins on 
the supply and demand, and provide updated information for 
peasants in production and operations. 
  2. Actively guide and organize peasants to enter markets and 
build a bridge between production and demand so that the two can 
meet. Recently, the operating modes, such as trade-industrial- 
agricultural integration, production-processing-sale strings, 
firms-led peasant households, and various special associations, 
are all better organizational forms in which to guide peasants 
toward markets. We must actively supports these forms. We must 
break through the restrictions of the ownership system and 
administrative regions, orient toward domestic and international 
market, guide the agricultural, industrial, commercial, trading, 
and technological sectors together to form a risk- and 
benefit-sharing common body through socialized services and 
channeling of interests. 
  3. Form an agricultural product market system and build a 
normal operating order. To foster and promote a market system, 
the state has deregulated most of the prices and operations of 
agricultural products, and pursued the policy of allowing 
markets to decide prices for agricultural products and different 
modes of operation. However, some localities have erected 
regional and customs barriers, preventing the circulation of 
commodities and the formation of a great national market and 
hindering production development. A market is a system. We 
must create a primary-product market for producers and a retail 
market in sales regions. Most importantly, we must establish 
various wholesaling markets. Under unified planning, we can 
establish an agricultural product market system centering on 
wholesale markets linking up the producers and sellers of key 
agricultural products, such as grains and cotton, through 
wholesaling markets and establish legally safeguarded economic 
relations. 
<H3>  Continued Efforts To Underwrite the Healthy Development of 
Township and Town Enterprises </H3>
  The main objective for developing township and town 
enterprises is to put the development of township and town 
enterprises on the track of technological progress and upgrade 
the quality of labor force. Blind launching of projects and 
competing for rates should be avoided. There must be vigorous 
efforts to promote and technologically transform and adjust the 
product mix and pursue strict scientific management to raise 
economic efficiency. 
  The eastern region must orient toward efficiency and 
exporting and adjust the product mix to make improvements in 
standards, quality, scale, and efficiency. The central and 
western regions must increase the pace of development, organize 
the implementation of the "east-west cooperation and development 
project," and promote mutual supplementation of comparative 
advantages and mutual development. The development of small 
industrial zones will trigger the that of small towns and 
promote the development of tertiary industry in rural areas. 
<H5>  Gradually Transfer Rural Surplus Labor </H5>
  One of the causes of slow peasant income growth is the 
absence of full employment. At present, there is a 170 million 
surplus rural labor force, representing one of the more 
outstanding rural problems. Practical situations suggest that 
it is possible to transfer part of this surplus rural labor 
force to industry and other nonagricultural sectors. From 1985 
to 1988, the country transferred on average about 10 million 
people each year and 11 million by 1992. 
  In recent years, peasant incomes derived from labor services 
have become an important source of income. In 1985, the per 
capita labor service income was 27 yuan, rising to 82 yuan in 
1992, 10.5 percent of the year's per capita pure income for 
peasants. Localities cite many successes in this regard. 
Leaders from Lin County, Henan Province, led, in an organized 
manner, peasants as early as the 1980's to work in construction 
industry outside the province. Riding on the name of Henan being 
the home for traditional fine handicraft workers, this 
130,000-strong construction labor force travelled through 
Taihang all over the country to earn income for themselves and 
create wealth for the country. They returned with much 
information and introduced talents and technology, which 
promoted the healthy development of township and town 
enterprises in the whole county. Last year, per capita pure 
income in the whole county was 792 yuan and is expected to reach 
some 900. The combined economic strength of the county rose 
from 44th to 14th in the province's county-level ranking. 
Experience from localities show that transferring rural surplus 
labor force must proceed in various ways: One, vigorously 
develop township and town enterprises. Plans are in place to 
transfer another 50 million by the end of this century, though 
this figure can be exceeded considerably. Two, develop and 
fully exploit agricultural resources, extend the space of 
development for agriculture and create jobs from it. Three, on 
the basis of policy coordination, actively create conditions to 
get farm hands to work in townships and towns. Four, develop in 
a planned manner small towns, and vigorously develops secondary 
and tertiary industries to channel rural surplus labor force 
toward nonagricultural sectors. 
<H5>  Continue To Pursue the Task of Reducing Peasant Burdens </H5>
  Reducing peasant burdens is a policy-directed measure for 
maintaining peasants' production motivation. Since last year, 
governments and departments concerned at all levels have 
conscientiously carried out various policies on reducing peasant 
burdens and done much painstaking work. They have effectively 
curbed arbitrary apportioning, levying, and financing and 
reduced much of peasants' unreasonable burdens. Peasants called 
the burden reduction policy one of the Communist Party's big 
services for the people. But down on the field, factors that 
may potentially increase the burdens for peasants remain. Some 
departments are thinking of restoring some financing and levy 
charges for some public charities. This is understandable. For 
a department, the problem is not big. But when all departments 
are asking money from peasants for different projects, peasants 
will have a hard time. They can hardly bear all these burdens 
with their low income. 
  We should all think with the overall situation in mind and 
continue to adopt effective measures to reduce peasants' burdens. 
<H5>  Pursue Well the Support-the-Poor Scheme </H5>
  At present, there are more than 80 million people across the 
country for whom having enough to eat and to cloth themselves is 
still a problem. Without this problem for this part of the 
population, it is hard to achieve the relatively well-off living 
standards for the whole country. To solve the problem of 
getting enough to eat and keep warm for this 80 million, the 
State Council has decided to formulate and implement a "eight 
seven plan to take on the hardest parts of the support-the-poor 
scheme." Under the plan, from this year up to the end of this 
century, the problem of having enough to eat and keep warm for 
this number of people will be basically solved in seven years' 
time; and, further, they will have eradicated poverty on their 
way to prosperity. The next step consists of the formulation 
and implementation of the "eight seven plan to take on the 
hardest parts of the support-the-poor scheme." One, a serious 
summing up of the work and study to put forward new methods and 
measures for the support-the-poor scheme under the new 
situation. Two, perfect various policies and measures and 
increase input into the scheme. The central authorities are 
continuing with the program of getting the aided areas to repay 
relief with grains and low-to middle-standard industrial 
products. The additional parts of such a program concentrate on 
transport and communications in poor regions to ensure that 
there are roads to ensure improvements in necessary production 
and living conditions. Three, management of funds and materials 
for the support-the-poor scheme must be relatively centralized 
to be allocated rationally on a regional mix basis, with a view 
to gradually spending more in the poorest areas in the central 
and western regions.

  [Text] Article 1. These procedures are formulated on the 
basis of relevant laws and regulations of the state to 
strengthen control over Sino-foreign joint ventures, enterprises 
under cooperative management by China and foreign countries, and 
foreign-funded enterprises (hereinafter called foreign-invested 
enterprises for short) and to facilitate the establishment of

plan, and the village and town construction plan. 
  Foreign-invested enterprises must submit documents on 
approved construction projects and certificates attesting to

different trades, the technological level of different projects, 
and the location of the land. 
  Enterprises producing goods for export and high-technology 
enterprises are exempted from land-use fees for five years, from

  [Text] Nanjing, January 28 (XINHUA) -- The private sector 
of Jiangsu Province's economy saw rapid growth last year. 
  Statistics show that the number of self-employed households 
has now reached 1.12 million, up by 28 percent, and private 
enterprises are up to 12,000, a 113 percent rise over 1992. 
  The rapid growth in the private economic sector is a result 
of favorable policies adopted by the Jiangsu provincial 
government. 
  Jiangsu dropped restrictions on the business scope for the 
development of private economy and took measures to encourage 
private enterprises and self-employed households to expand their 
business in technology-oriented and export-oriented services. 
  The Jiangsu Provincial Administration of Industry and 
Commerce also arranged for managers of private enterprises to go 
abroad to broaden their entrepreneurial vision. 
  The economic strength of private enterprises also increased 
last year. Of the 6,795 newly-established private enterprises, 
there are 174 households whose registered funds exceed 1 million 
yuan each. 
  The self-employed households and private enterprises turned 
over taxes of 2.7 billion yuan to the state in 1993, accounting 
for 11.6 percent of the total commercial and industrial tax 
payment in Jiangsu. 
  Last year, 86 private enterprises in Jiangsu set up joint 
ventures with overseas counterparts, an increase of over 100 
percent over 1992. 
  The export value of the private enterprises in the province 
was 71.46 million yuan.

  [Text] Nanjing, February 2 (XINHUA) -- East China's 
Jiangsu Province enjoyed a great leap forward in its service 
industry over the past couple of years. Last year, Jiangsu's 
servce sector accounted for 24.4 percent of the province's gross 
domestic prouct. For a long time, the service industry had 
trailed the more developed manufacturing industry. Since the 
1990's the local authorities have given priority to boost the 
province's service sector. Of the newly lanched industrial and 
commercial enterprises over the past two years, more than half 
were in the service sector. They range from commodity 
circulation and catering to real estate and entertainment. 
  Most privtely-run busiesses are in the service industries. 
More than 300 private establishments are engaged in consultancy 
in science and technology. 
  Investment in fixed assets of the service industry doubled 
last year, as it also did the previous year. Infrastructure 
such as transport and posts and telecommunications made 
remarkable achievements. 
  In 1993, the province built additional electric generating 
capacity of two million kw and installed telephone exchanges 
with a capacity of 1.132 million lines. Construction is in full 
swing for highways connecting the provincial capital with 
Shanghai and other cities, ports and airports. 
  As a major commodities transfer center in the lower reaches 
of the Chang Jiang River, Jiangsu has set up close to the 
marketplace, more than 300 capital goods markets and over 130 
financial markets. Overseas funds also poured into the 
developmet of tourism, retail business, property and 
infrastructure. 
  Experts believe the flourishing service industry in Jiangsu 
helps optimize its overall industrial setup and improve the 
investment environment. A service industry with a core 
diversified pattern is shaping up in major cities along the 
Chang Jiang river as they try to bring themselves up to 
internationl standards.

  [Text] Yesterday, at this year's first expanded executive 
meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Government, Mayor Huang Ju 
pointed out that the general goal of the municipal government's 
work in 1994 is to earnestly study Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and the guidelines 
set by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee; to further unify our thinking and emancipate our 
minds; to seek new ideas; to be bold in pioneering new spheres 
of endeavor; to strive to seek breakthroughs; to create a new 
situation in Shanghai's work; to endeavor to make new 
breakthroughs in gaining the initiative in building socialist 
market economic operating mechanisms; and to strive to maintain 
the good trend of Shanghai's sustained, rapid, and healthy 
economic development. 
  The meeting's main topic was to review and sum up Shanghai's 
work in 1993 and to set guidelines for the current primary 
tasks. Mayor Huang Ju delivered an important speech at the 
meeting. He said: The past year was one in which Shanghai 
thoroughly carried out the guidelines of the 14th CPC National 
Congress and of the Sixth Shanghai Municipal CPC Congress, and 
in which Shanghai began to seriously implement the 
municipality's long-term development strategy to develop it into 
the locomotive for the development of the areas along Chang 
Jiang, and into an international economic, financial, and trade 
center. Last year was also an important one in which Shanghai 
strived to push its economic development to a new level, sought 
new breakthroughs in its reform and opening up, and strived to 
bring new changes in its urban construction, in order to score 
new achievements in building spiritual civilization and to lay a 
foundation for the municipality to change its face every year 
and to have a complete face-lift every three years. With the 
common efforts of all Shanghai people, we have fulfilled Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's exhortation made early last year: "Let us work 
hard for another year; and let us brave the wind and waves, work 
in a down-to-earth manner, and overcome all difficulties to 
scale new heights." Huang Ju reviewed Shanghai's work in 1993 
from eight aspects: First, Shanghai's economic development was 
raised to a new level -- its annual total output value amounted 
to 150 billion yuan, an increase of 14.9 percent, which was 
higher than the previous year. Since the beginning of 1993, 
Shanghai's financial revenues increased steadily, resulting in 
an annual increase of 30.6 percent. Also, Shanghai's economic 
structure continued to improve, as did the quality of its 
economic functioning. Second, we made new progress in 
Shanghai's urban construction; a total of 13 billion yuan, which 
was a record amount, was used to improve the city's 
infrastructural facilities. A number of key projects that 
constitute the framework of the city's three-dimensional traffic 
network were completed and breakthroughs were made in 
constructing elevated highways, bringing about quite a change in 
the city's skyline. Third, new steps were made in deepening 
Shanghai's reform. The framework for developing a large market 
system was initially completed, and work in this area rapidly 
became more law-based and regularized. The market's fundamental 
role of budgeting resources was further strengthened. Fourth, 
new progress was made in opening Shanghai to the outside world. 
Last year the city attracted more than twice as much foreign 
funds as it did the year before; in addition, the percentages of 
large foreign projects and of well-known multi-national 
companies' investment were comparatively high, and the 
percentage of their investment success was also high. Fifth, 
new breakthroughs were made in Pudong's development. Pudong's 
export-oriented economic function focusing on international 
financial services, foreign trade, and export processing, began 
to work. Sixth, new development was made in all social sectors 
of the city. A giant stride was made in the city's educational 
reform, and the process of industrializing Shanghai's new and 
high technologies accelerated noticeably. Seventh, we continued 
to improve the people's livelihood, people's income increased, 
and all projects of practical benefit to the people were 
completed. Housing construction was raised to a new height -- 
new houses with a total floor space of more than 6 million 
square meters were completed; the quality of city residents' 
living conditions further improved. Eighth, the building of 
spiritual civilization reached a new level. Simultaneous soft 
and hard construction formed a powerful force for driving 
Shanghai's reform, opening up, and modernization forward. Huang 
Ju stressed: We must not be dazzled by our achievements; we 
should realize that many contradictions, difficulties, and 
problems still lay ahead. It is relatively difficult to handle 
the relationship between reform, development, and maintaining 
stability properly, and it is quite an arduous task to maintain 
the good trend of economic development. We need to double our 
efforts to overcome these difficulties and to solve these 
problems. 
  While reviewing and summing up Shanghai's work in 1993, 
Huang 
Ju emphatically pointed out: Under the leadership of the CPC 
Central Committee, State Council, and Shanghai Municipal CPC 
Committee; and under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
the party's basic line adopted by the Third Plenary Session of 
the 11th CPC Central Committee, we must unswervingly adhere to 
the central task of economic construction, insist on constantly 
emancipating our minds, and insist on continuing to make 
explorations with Chinese characteristics, the characteristics 
of our time, and the characteristics of Shanghai -- this is the 
foothold for Shanghai's constant efforts to create a new 
situation in reform and opening up, and to quicken the pace of 
Shanghai's modernization drive. We pursued the following five 
principles in carrying out our work in 1993: First, we adhered 
to the principle "development is the last word," seized the 
opportunity, quickened the pace of development, and did 
everything possible to speed up our economic construction. 
Second, we strived to maintain an edge in reform and in opening 
up, and quickened the step of building the socialist market 
economic system framework. Third, we insisted on using high 
standards for our urban construction work in order to lay a 
foundation for developing Shanghai into a modern international 
city. Fourth, we insisted on correctly handling the 
relationship between reform, development, and maintaining 
stability, to create a good social environment for accelerating 
reform and development. Fifth, we insisted on rallying the 
enthusiasm of the municipal government and the district and 
county governments to actively explore new ways for 
administering a super-size city. 
  Huang Ju continued: As to this year's work, an initial plan 
was set forth at the Second Plenary Session of the Sixth 
Municipal CPC Committee. We need to rely on the common efforts 
of all the people of Shanghai in carrying out the work ahead of 
us. We need to start from the beginning of the new year and to 
attend to everything we must do; we must ensure a good 
beginning, add a new dimension to our work, and maintain a good 
trend, in order to lay a solid foundation for completely 
achieving all the targets set for this year. 
  While discussing Shanghai's current tasks, Huang Ju pointed 
out: First, we should ensure a prosperous market, maintain 
economic stability, and attach great importance to price issues. 
Concerned departments of the municipal government should fully 
cooperate with each other, keep a close eye on the market 
situation, tighten market controls, and strengthen price 
supervision. They should resolutely crack down on any attempt 
to drive up prices and to manipulate the market, and on other 
illegal practices; and should sternly punish those involved. We 
should do everything we can to secure commodity supplies, ensure 
abundant stocks, and ensure commodity supplies during the coming 
Spring Festival season. Commercial establishments and the 
service sector should launch emulation campaigns on providing 
civilized and good services; all sectors should work hand in 
hand to enable Shanghai residents to enjoy a peaceful and happy 
Spring Festival. We should conscientiously carry out the 
state's major policies and ensure that all reform measures are 
instituted in due time. The municipal government, and all 
district and county governments should continue to enhance their 
ability to deal with new situations and problems; they should 
strive to ensure that things proceed steadily and endeavor to 
maintain economic and social stability. Second, we should 
ensure social stability; we should continue to sternly and 
swiftly crack down on crimes, resolvedly wipe out all kinds of 
social evils, and manage the population from other localities 
properly. We should further improve traffic control and 
conditions, and step up publicizing traffic regulations. Public 
transportation departments should take positive measures to 
solve commuting problems. We should take effective measures to 
improve safety work and to prevent major accidents from 
occurring. We should correctly handle the internal 
contradictions among the people and remove all destabilizing 
factors. Following the municipal government's guidelines, 
departments concerned should launch extensive activities to help 
the less fortunate; we should ensure that living allowances for 
retired workers and people with special difficulties are 
delivered to individuals. Third, we should ensure that rural 
areas' year-end distribution work is properly carried out; we 
should do our best to raise sufficient distribution funds to 
ensure that the peasants' burdens that have been removed by 
order are not reinstituted at year-end distribution. All county 
and township (town) governments should provide better guidance 
for conducting distribution work, step up coordination and 
inspection work, and endeavor to complete the work by the end of 
January. Fourth, we should step up work on preventing 
contagious diseases prevailing in winter and spring; we should 
strengthen inspection and supervision of food production work 
and food hygiene in all food stores; we should continue to ban 
the sale of blood clams. The news media should feature health 
education programs to enhance residents' health-care 
consciousness. 
  The meeting also decided the further division of work 
concerning preparatory tasks for holding the next municipal 
people's congress; the municipal government's efforts to restore 
and improve the Waitan financial district's functions; the 
establishment of new enterprise systems; the building of a 
central commercial district; and concerning the co-investment of 
large projects. Attending the meeting were vice mayors of 
Shanghai; responsible persons of all commissions, offices, and 
bureaus of the municipal government; and responsible individuals 
of all district and county governments.

3552 2646), Qian Wenying (6929 2429 3841), and Du Xiangsheng 
(6757 4382 3932): "Take Problems in Market Construction 
Seriously"] 
  [Text] As of the end of last year, Shanghai had 10 
national-level commodity exchange markets, making 1993 a year of 
steady progress in the municipality's market construction. 
Building a framework of major commodity markets in Shanghai in 
accordance with the needs of a socialist market economy is a new 
agenda. The 10 commodity markets all have the characteristics 
of a modern market: 
  -- The markets are comprehensive and large in scale. 
Shanghai did not have a head start in major commodity market 
construction; however, it has advanced quickly and has surpassed 
the early starters. It not only leads the rest of the country 
in the number of national-level commodity exchange markets but 
also ranks among the top in transaction volume. The total 
amount of transactions reached 450 billion yuan last year. In 
addition, the municipality has comprehensive commodity markets, 
consisting of eight capital goods and two consumer goods 
markets. The eight capital goods markets cover all the 
categories of capital goods. 
  -- The markets have instituted mechanisms for conducting 
futures transactions and are advancing toward becoming standard 
futures markets. All 10 major exchanges have instituted 
mechanisms for operating futures transactions, including a 
membership system, a cash deposit system, open bidding, and 
uniform settlement. In addition, they are all working hard to 
promote futures transactions. Shanghai's metals exchange 
conducted 108,737 million yuan of futures transactions using 
standard contracts last year, representing 28 percent of the 
total volume of the exchange's transactions. Shanghai's building 
materials exchange conducted four transactions using standard 
contracts as soon as it began operation at the end of last year. 
  -- Their members are numerous and scattered throughout the 
country, and their structures are rational. Each of the 
exchanges has several dozen members, and one has 209. About 
half of their members come from other parts of the country while 
the other half are local enterprises. Among them are producers, 
end-users, businesses in the circulation area, and specialized 
brokerage companies. 
  -- The rate of contract fulfillment has been fairly high. 
All the exchanges have formulated self-regulatory rules 
governing administration, transactions, and membership, thereby 
ensuring a good and sound market order. 
  -- Development is uneven. Trading is more active in 
exchanges dealing with commodities that are more 
market-oriented. Shanghai's metals exchange, for example, had a 
record daily transaction of 5.7 billion yuan, and its total 
volume of transactions last year reached 400 billion yuan, 
making it the third largest metals exchange in the world. 
Trading is rather slow in exchanges dealing with commodities 
that are more planning-oriented. Shanghai's automobile exchange 
market, farming goods exchange, and coal exchange had an average 
of 612,000 yuan, 739,000 yuan, and 964,000 yuan, respectively, 
in daily transactions. 
  Shanghai's 10 major markets have already made positive 
contributions. They have, for example, made initial 
contributions to reducing price fluctuations in spot markets by 
helping set prices and guide production. They have helped 
enterprises reduce their inventories and save capital through 
rational allocation of resources. They have removed from the 
economic system the elements of "informal transactions" and 
other factors affecting fair competition. They have helped 
train a number of specialized personnel for many emerging 
industries and trades. 
  Shanghai's national-level commodity exchange markets have 
also encountered problems during their development. The main 
problems, as reported by the exchanges, are the lack of a 
municipality-wide unified authoritative administrative agency; 
the lack of municipality uniform transaction rules and 
regulations; the lack of an independent settlement company 
serving the needs of the exchanges; and the lack of special 
warehouses for transactions in kind. In addition, futures 
personnel training and management are in chaos, and there are 
too many departments demanding transaction data. Further, the 
exchanges' self-regulatory rules and regulations are still in an 
early stage of development. There are many loopholes in hedging 
risks on the part of the exchanges and in monitoring members' 
trading practices. 
  Shanghai's national-level commodity exchange markets should 
pay close attention to the following tasks to ensure steady, 
regularized, and sound development: 
  1. The municipality should set up a separate market 
supervision and management commission to undertake comprehensive 
planning and rational distribution and to strictly screen the 
categories and varieties of commodities placed for trading. The 
commission should remove commodities not suitable for futures 
exchange and should help coordinate matters related to trading. 
  2. The municipality should transform two or three selected 
exchanges into standard futures commodity exchanges ahead of 
others and link them to the international market by cultivating 
and developing them on a priority basis. It should prescribe 
medicine for exchanges with slack business according to their 
symptoms: replacing commodities that will be planning-oriented 
for the next few years; based on the requirements of spot 
exchange, regulate markets that are not suitable for futures 
transactions; and merge various specialized futures exchange 
markets when conditions are ripe so that transactions can be 
conducted in a single market to improve efficiency. 
  3. The municipality should step up training of trading 
specialists, conduct in-depth study on trading issues, help 
organize influential multi-purpose brokerage companies, and 
attract more producers, end-users, and intermediary businesses 
to engage in futures trading.

<F P=106> ["Li Zemin Speaks at First Plenary Session of the Ninth </F>
Zhejiang Provincial CPC Committee, Stressing Need to Implement 
the Tasks Set by the Party Congress With a New Attitude"] 
  [Text] Yesterday afternoon, the Ninth Zhejiang Provincial 
CPC Committee held a plenary meeting. Wan Yueyuan, deputy 
secretary of the provincial party committee and governor of 
Zhejiang, presided over the meeting. Chai Songyue, deputy 
secretary of the provincial party committee and vice governor, 
transmitted the national economic work conference guidelines. 
Li Zemin, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
delivered a speech on behalf of the provincial party committee 
standing committee to express views on how to implement the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee decision 
and the provincial party committee's work in 1994. 
  Li Zemin said: The next five years will be a decisive period 
for forming an operational mechanism for a socialist market 
economy in this province and fulfilling the second-step 
strategic goal ahead of schedule as well as a period for laying 
down a good foundation for realizing modernization by 2010. The 
new provincial party committee is formed in a critical period of 
accelerating the pace of reform, opening up, and the 
modernization drive, so it has a great responsibility. You 
members, especially standing committee members, must do your 
best to fulfill your duties, persist in serving the people 
wholeheartedly, study diligently, and constantly raise your 
ideological, theoretical, and leadership levels. You should 
promote unity, strictly implement the democratic centralism 
system, and consciously accept supervision from various sides. 
We must take a new attitude and a new style of work, 
concentrate all forces to accomplish various tasks set by the 
provincial party congress, be worthy of the trust of the people 
of the whole province, and never let the party Central Committee 
down. 
  Li Zemin said: Next year will be critical for promoting 
reform in an all-round way and maintaining a fast and healthy 
development of the economy. It is extremely important to do 
well next year's work. The general demands for our work in the 
next year are: Firmly take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's 
basic line as our guidance; implement in an all-round way the 
14th CPC National Congress, the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee, and the Ninth Zhejiang Provincial 
CPC Congress guidelines; take advantage of current opportunities 
to speed up reform and development; correctly handle relations 
between reform, development, and stability; persist in 
"attaching importance to both spiritual and material 
civilizations"; maintain social stability; and promote a 
sustained, fast, and healthy development of the national economy. 
  Li Zemin pointed out: Next year will be critical for 
promoting reform in an all-round way while centering around the 
work of establishing a socialist market economic structure. It 
will also be a year to deepen and expand the scope of reform 
with great difficulties. We must fully understand the 
complicated and arduous nature of promoting reform in an 
all-round way. Party committees and governments at various 
levels must make greater efforts and strengthen their leadership 
over the reform work, pay attention to solving key problems, 
plan and organize reform work carefully, insure stability, 
reduce risks, and strive to achieve success in the reform work. 
We should stress the following five points: 1) It is necessary 
to continue the work of changing the enterprises' operational 
mechanism and take the reform of the property rights system as 
the breakthrough point in experimenting with the modern 
enterprise system at selected units. 2) It is necessary to give 
prominence to establishing and developing various markets for 
the basic means of production while consolidating and improving 
the existing commodity markets. 3) It is necessary to continue 
the social security system reform. 4) It is necessary to 
promote comprehensive reform in finance, taxation, banking, and 
investment in a planned manner. 5) It is necessary to promote 
organizational reform and change government functions. 
  Li Zemin pointed out: We must adhere to the main direction 
of taking advantage of the current favorable conditions to 
accelerate reform and development, and should follow the central 
guidelines of relying on reform in promoting development. We 
must not seek rigid uniformity in the speed of economic 
development. We should make the investment structure as 
effective as possible and increase the returns on investment. 
The general demand on economic work is to raise economic 
quality and efficiency through reform, reorganization, 
transformation, structural adjustment, technological progress, 
and improvement of enterprise management. We should stress four 
points: 1) It is necessary to strengthen leadership over 
agricultural work and give priority and prominence to the work. 
2) It is necessary to further open up to promote reform and 
development. While increasing the total volume of 
export-oriented economy, we should also pay attention to 
quality. 3) It is necessary to adjust the production structure 
and raise economic results. 4) It is necessary to continue the 
speedy construction of infrastructure works and make great 
efforts to reduce the limits of "bottlenecks." 
  Li Zemin pointed out: To accomplish next year's reform, 
construction, and other tasks, we must persist in paying 
attention to "both links" [liang shou zhua 0357 2087 2119] and 
maintain a stable social and political environment. We should 
promote reform and construction amid stability, and rely on 
reform and construction to insure long-term stability in 
society. This should be an important principle in next year's 
work. First, we should control the level of price increases and 
do a good job in improving people's living conditions. Second, 
we should do a good job in six things [liu jian shi 0362 0115 
0057] solidly. Third, we should correctly handle various kinds 
of contradictions in society, and do a good job in the 
comprehensive management of public security. Fourth, we should 
promote socialist democracy and the construction of the legal 
system. Fifth, we should firmly unfold struggles against 
corruption and achieve effective results step by step. 
  Li Zemin emphatically pointed out: To accomplish various 
tasks in the next year, the key lies in strengthening and 
improving the party's leadership. We should improve ourselves, 
have a new mental outlook and style of work, do things in 
solidly, and make actual achievements. To improve the party's 
own building, first of all, we must pay attention to improving 
the leading bodies at county and above level. We should 
consider the work of organizing the study of Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping as a work of primary 
importance. Meanwhile, we should also study well the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Committee decision. We should 
train all leading cadres at and above county level next year. 
We must not slacken our efforts to improve the ideology and 
work style of leading cadres. Party committees at various 
levels must set strict demands on leading cadres, and train and 
supervise them strictly. We should attach great importance to 
the building of party organizations at the grass-roots level. 
In particular, we should continue to improve the backward party 
branches in rural areas and actively explore ways to improve 
party organizations in village and town enterprises and "joint 
ventures, cooperative ventures, and wholly foreign-owned 
enterprises." We should do a good job in admitting new party 
members from plants, rural areas, science-technology research 
institutes, and the education front. Leading cadres at various 
levels should conscientiously and honestly perform their duties 
and effectively improve their leading style. First, the 
provincial party committee should concentrate on discussing and 
tackling major issues, hold periodic meetings to analyze current 
situation, and have a good grasp of the trend of economic and 
social development. It is necessary to attach importance to 
investigation and study. Provincial party committee standing 
committee members should at least spend two months at lower 
levels and make one or two investigation and research reports 
according to their respective duties for reference when the 
standing committee makes policy decisions. Second, they should 
take the whole situation into consideration, coordinate the work 
of various sides, establish a responsibility system for their 
respective duties, and develop the role of the provincial party 
committee and its standing committee. Third, standing committee 
members should pay attention to supervision and inspection, and 
plan to carry out inspection work. They should timely supervise 
and check the implementation of provincial party committee 
arrangements. Standing committee members and concerned 
departments should report to the provincial party committee, and 
each level should check the work of the lower level to ascertain 
the implementation and results of various resolutions. Fourth, 
it is imperative to forbid formalism and reduce "documents and 
meetings" and various kinds of social activities. Meetings and 
speeches should be short, and things should be done in an 
effective manner with actual results. 
  Those attending yesterday's plenary meeting were provincial 
party committee members and alternate members. Provincial 
discipline inspection commission members, leading party cadres 
at and above deputy provincial department head level, veteran 
party comrades, party committee secretaries of various cities 
(prefectures) and counties, various mayors, various prefectural 
commissioners, responsible members of the provincial people's 
congress and the provincial committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference, and principal responsible 
members of party committees (leading party groups) of various 
provincial level departments attended the meeting as observers.

<F P=106> [From the "Provincial News Hookup" program] </F>
  [Text] At the provincial meeting on economic work which 
concluded on 13 January, provincial party secretary Li Zemin 
discussed his opinions on how party and government organizations 
at all levels can improve their leadership and ideology to carry 
out well this year's economic work. 
  Li Zemin said: This year is critical for pushing forward 
reform in a comprehensive way and accelerating economic 
development. The overall requirement for the work is that we 
should continue to carry out the guiding spirit of the 14th CPC 
Congress, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee, and the ninth provincial CPC congress by further 
emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts, seizing 
opportunities, deepening reform, opening wider to the outside 
world, accelerating economic development; pushing forward 
economic restructuring, technological progress, and enterprise 
management; and enhancing economic quality and efficiency 
through reform, reorganization, and transformation so as to 
maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the 
national economy and to promote social and political stability. 
  Li Zemin said: It is an essential task to maintain the 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national 
economy. But we must adopt new approaches to develop our 
economy because great changes have occurred in the economic 
environment this year. It is absolutely not practical for us to 
continue the same old ways of rashly launching new projects and 
engaging in extensive enlargement and extensive management. We 
should have a real change in our guiding ideology of economic 
development. A new economic structure has created good 
conditions for enterprises to compete on equal terms and to seek 
self-development. It is necessary to seize favorable 
opportunities by deepening reform and taking greater advantage 
of the market mechanism, as well as of economic, legal, and 
policy means to gradually lead the economy onto the right track 
of optimizing the economic structure, enhancing economic quality 
and performance, and becoming more export-oriented. In terms of 
concrete guidance for the work, we should, first of all, work 
harder on agricultural production. We should conscientiously 
put it on the priority agenda. Party committees and governments 
at all levels should strengthen their leadership and correct 
their laissez-faire tendency so as to stabilize grain 
production. The orientation of the reform adopted by the 
central authorities last year should be maintained. It is 
necessary to conscientiously carry it out in accordance with 
various policies and measures adopted last year by the 
provincial meeting on rural work. Meanwhile, further efforts 
should be made to adjust and improve the reform in light of 
current new conditions and problems. All in all, we should not 
only maintain stable grain production but also continuously 
increase peasants' income. Efforts should also be made to 
ensure the supply of vegetables, pork, and other nonstaple 
products in large and medium cities. We should adopt measures 
to gradually establish means of macroeconomic regulation and 
control over the production, circulation, and storage of grain, 
edible oil, meat, and vegetables to stabilize the market with a 
sufficient supply. Second, great efforts should be made to 
restructure the economy and enhance economic efficiency. It is 
imperative to seize vital opportunities to achieve new progress. 
We should also meet the requirement of the market, focus on 
improving economic quality and efficiency, and accelerate the 
pace of readjustment. While striving to improve large and 
medium enterprises, we should attach great importance to medium 
and small enterprises, which are large in number and which 
affect many economic sectors. Particular attention should be 
paid to reorganizing and transforming enterprises which are 
small in size, have insufficient funds, have large losses, and 
are unable to function properly. More efforts should be made to 
improve products, to enhance technical progress, to expand 
markets, and to merge enterprises. We can achieve better 
economic results through strengthening the reform, management, 
reorganization, and transformation of enterprises. Third, it is 
necessary to accelerate the growth of the export-oriented 
economy. It is our unswerving principle to develop an 
export-oriented economy. We must take steps and make greater 
efforts to publicize our drive and in communicating with the 
people. In this way, we can foster a favorable image and 
maintain the positive momentum of increasing foreign funds, 
foreign trade, and economic ties with foreign countries. 
Fourth, we must continue to accelerate the construction of 
basic facilities, further free our way of thinking, and continue 
to thoroughly carry out the reform so as to gradually relieve 
bottlenecks. 
  Li Zemin said: In carrying out reform, we should adhere to 
the principle of integrating measures for achieving major 
breakthroughs with supplementary measures. In light of 
requirements for establishing a modern enterprise system, we 
should make a breakthrough in reforming property rights, 
accelerate the change of enterprises' operating mechanisms, and 
deepen their overall reform. While focusing on experiments with 
the modern corporate system, we should make more efforts to 
reform medium and small enterprises, which are large in number 
and which affect many economic sectors. Active efforts should be 
made to explore rational forms and ways to merge and manage 
medium and small enterprises. For small enterprises, we should 
work harder to improve their structure by having them contracted 
out or leased. We should transform and merge them. In some 
cases, we should auction them off or let them go bankrupt. We 
should clearly define their property rights and carry out an 
inventory and examination of their stockpiles and capital. 
Collective enterprises in urban and rural areas should actively 
and properly practice, to a greater extent, the shareholding 
corporate system. To keep in step with this effort, we should 
also push forward the development of the factors-of-production 
market and the reform of organizations making up the social 
security system. 
  Li Zemin said: The greater difficulty we encounter in reform 
and economic development requires that we exert greater efforts 
to "grasp two links" because this is a task which has a great 
bearing on the overall state of social stability. At present, 
we should attach great importance to ideological and political 
work and launch an extensive propaganda and educational drive. 
Meanwhile, we should integrate ideological and political work 
with efforts to solve the people's concrete problems. We should 
conscientiously carry out the work of stabilizing commodity 
prices, improving the "vegetable basket" project, subsidizing 
the living expenses of workers and staff members, and helping 
people solve their problems. It is imperative to analyze and 
handle various contradictions among the people. We should give 
priority to ideological and political work as well as to other 
related work, and we should carry these out thoroughly. In 
terms of the anticorruption struggle and the construction of 
spiritual civilization, we should carry these out in accordance 
with the plan adopted by the provincial party committee. We must 
see to it that the expected results for the current stage are 
achieved. 
  Li Zemin said: It is necessary to stress the importance of 
investigation and study. Leading comrades at all levels should 
have a clear understanding of the trend of economic and social 
development. Their current important task is get rid of such 
activities as wining and dining. They should go to grass-roots 
units and the production front line to learn the real situation 
so as to gain the initiative in leading the work.

  [Text] Hangzhou, February 1 (XINHUA) -- East China's 
Zhejiang, one of the economically developed provinces in China, 
plans to apply the standardized corporate enterprise system to 
some 1,000 state-owned enterprises this year in a bid to 
accelerate expansion of the share-holding system. 
  Addressing a working conference which ended here recently, 
Lu 
Wenge, director of the provincial committee for restructuring 
the economy, mentioned that the share-holding system will also 
be applied to energy and infrastructural construction. 
  He noted that the reform of the property rights system will 
be deepened, too. Meanwhile, such sectors as accounting, audit 
and law offices as well as the securities exchanges will play 
important roles in supervising the process of the reform of 
those enterprises. 
  Zhejiang is one of a handful of provinces which piloted the 
introduction of the share-holding system in China in the late 
1980s. 
  Over the past few years, the province has already witnessed 
remarkable progress in establishing and expanding the 
share-holding system in its state-owned, collective and private 
firms. 
  By the end of 1993, the province had approved some 126 
standardized share-holding companies, involving a total 
registered capital of about 8.15 billion yuan, according to 
official sources. 
  Of those 126 companies, 15 have issued stock publicly and 
eight have been listed on the stock exchanges in Shanghai and 
Shenzhen. 
  In addition to the share-holding system, the formation of 
limited liability companies has expanded greatly, with some 
1,067 limited liability companies approved in the province by 
the end of 1993. 
  Apart from the step-by-step transformation of state-owned 
enterprises to the share-holding system, some 700 small 
collective firms as well as more than 60,000 rural enterprises 
have also adopted the new system of cooperative share-holding. 
  Through transforming management mechanisms, most of the 
share- holding companies have collected enough money to enlarge 
the production scale and have already made greater profits. 
  Meanwhile, the province has also made progress by 
introducing 
the share-holding system in the development of such basic 
industries as energy, transportation and telecommunications, 
which had hindered the development of the economy as a whole 
because of a lack of construction funds. 
  Yan Chunyou, an official under the provincial committee for 
restructuring the economy, said, "the reform of the 
share-holding system is the key to the modern enterprise system, 
and it's an effective way to enlarge the production scale of 
those firms who adopt this system and to improve their 
performance in both international and domestic markets." 
  The introduction of the share-holding system has not only 
defined property rights clearly but also boosted reforms in the 
employment, distribution and management systems of the 
enterprises, Yan said. 
  China is now making painstaking efforts to transform the 
management mechanism of its state-owned enterprises, in a bid to 
build a modern enterprise system, one of the major objectives of 
its economic development.

  [Text] The provincial party committee and government 
jointly held a family planning forum yesterday. 
  Provincial party committee Secretary Xie Shijie delivered a 
speech in which he called on principal party and government 
leaders at all levels across the province to correctly handle 
dialectical relations between population and economy; strengthen 
a sense of urgency in population control while striving to push 
economic growth onto a new stage; and further improve family 
planning work. 
  At a time when a provincial people's congress session and a 
provincial Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference 
session were being held, the provincial party committee and 
government jointly invited principal prefectural, city, and 
autonomous prefectural leaders, as well as principal leaders in 
charge of the various provincial departments concerned, to a 
forum to discuss family planning work. This was indeed an 
unprecedented move in the province's history. 
  Qin Yuqin, provincial party committee deputy secretary, 
presided over yesterday's forum at which she delivered a speech, 
calling for establishing a system whereby family planning forums 
are held at regular intervals so that leaders can discuss and 
formulate strategies and push family planning work onto a new 
stage. 
  Zhang Zhongwei, provincial party committee standing 
committee 
member and provincial vice governor, first took the floor to 
brief the leaders on Sichuan's population situation. 
  Provincial party committee Secretary Xie Shijie and Xiao 
Yang, provincial party committee deputy secretary and provincial 
governor, delivered important speeches at the forum. 
  Comrade Xie Shijie pointed out: While building a socialist 
market economic structure we should correctly handle dialectical 
relations between population and economy; place population 
growth under control; and strive to improve population quality, 
this being our basic national policy with special significance 
to Sichuan entering the international market and participating 
in international competition. He stated: Market competition 
will in no way repel family planning. Rather, it calls for 
integrating social family planning with household family 
planning; integrating a social restriction mechanism with an 
interest orientation mechanism; integrating propaganda and 
education with the legal system in this regard; integrating 
administrative management with family planning among the masses; 
and integrating conception and sterilization with quality 
childbirth in order that the broad masses of the people are able 
to consciously implement family planning in production 
activities, daily life, and family life. 
  Comrade Xie Shijie called on principal party and government 
leaders at all levels to conscientiously implement to the letter 
all five family planning requirements laid down by General 
Secretary Jiang Zemin; take personal charge of and assume 
overall responsibilities for family planning work; and firmly 
grasp the following three work aspects: 
  1. Strengthen grass-roots family planning networks and 
implement the instruction issued by the provincial party 
committee and government about stabilizing the family planning 
contingent, building more family planning offices at the 
township level, and training family planning contingents at the 
village level; 
  2. Conscientiously examine the family planning situation and 
assume personal responsibility for attaining family planning 
quotas. 
  3. Increase the financial input into family planning; 
provide family planning with sufficient operational funds; take 
family planning as an important criterion for appraising, 
commending, rewarding, selecting, and promoting party and 
government cadres; and step up education on family planning as 
one of the basic national policies among party members and 
cadres. The party members and cadres should try to set a fine 
example and play an exemplary role in this regard. 
  Comrade Xiao Yang said: Being a populous province, Sichuan 
will find it more difficult to realize comparatively well-off 
living standards. In view of this situation, principal party 
and government leaders at all levels should take personal charge 
of and assume overall responsibility for family planning work. 
We should strive to build stronger and more efficient family 
planning organizations and support grass-roots family planning 
cadres in their work. All cities across the province should 
step up control of the floating population and provide family 
planning with sufficient operational funds. Should we fail to 
provide family planning with sufficient operational funds, we 
will unavoidably face serious consequences and have to spend 
more money in this connection. 
  Yang Xizong, provincial people's congress standing committee 
chairman, also delivered a speech in which he stressed: We are 
carrying out family planning work here in Sichuan on a solid 
basis. We have both rich family planning experience and 
effective family planning measures. Family planning depends on 
human efforts! We should conscientiously publicize and 
implement "Sichuan Provincial Family Planning Regulations"; 
conduct family planning in accordance with the law; further 
regularize family planning; and place family planning within the 
orbit of the legal system. 
  Leaders from Chengdu, Chongqing, Neijiang, Nanchong, and 
some 
others areas across the province reported on their respective 
family planning work; exchanged family planning experiences; and 
studied ways and means of strengthening family planning. 
  Also attending the forum were Song Baorui, Yang Chonghui, 
Diao Jinxiang, Xi Yifang, Kang Zhenhuang, Liu Changjie, Geng 
Quanli [provincial military district political commissar], Zhang 
Shikui, and others.

  [Text] Lhasa, February 2 (XINHUA) -- The Government of 
Tibet Autonomous Region has achieved much progress in the past 
few years in the development of markets. 
  The government invested about 25 million yuan in the 
construction of markets in recent years. Some 99 market places 
were established or reconstructed with the building area 
totalling more than 100,000 square meters. 
  The investment in the markets greatly improved efficiency. 
Last year the transaction value on free markets in urban and 
rural areas in Tibet was more than 900 million yuan, accounting 
for 47 percent of the region's total retail sales. 
  The development of markets has enhanced the commodity sense 
of farmers and herdsmen and markets have played a growing role 
in promoting the production of agriculture and animal husbandry. 
  Tibet has also set up some specialized markets for trading 
in 
herbs, animal products, timber, rolled steel and automobiles. 
  It has opened 28 markets on the frontiers to increase its 
trade with neighboring countries such as India, Nepal and Bhutan. 
  This year Tibet will set up auction markets and a job 
placement center so as to promote its market economy.

  [Text] Lhasa, February 1 (XINHUA) -- About 100 Tibetans who 
returned from overseas in the past few years gathered in Lhasa 
today to celebrate the coming Tibetan new year. 
  Along with the opening-up and economic growth of the Tibet 
Autonomous Region, more and more overseas Tibetans are coming 
back to visit relatives, to sight-see and to resettle. Last 
year more than 100 families came back to settle down. 
  Tibetans living abroad have helped promote their hometown 
economies and improved local school and hospital facilities. 
  Tibetans are welcome to return to visit their relatives and 
settle down and they are free to come back and to leave again, 
Basang, a regional government official in charge of the 
reception of returned Tibetans, said at the gathering.

  [Text] According to the latest statistics provided by the 
provincial statistical bureau yesterday, in the course of 
establishing a socialist market economic structure, Yunnan has 
strengthened and displayed the role of macrocontrol and 
regulation, thus bringing about a good trend of sustained, 
stable, and healthy national economic development. 
  Last year the province seriously implemented the relevant 
state macroeconomic policy. This helped alleviate prominent 
contradictions and problems in economic life. The national 
economy steadily developed on the basis of speedy growth in the 
previous year. Last year the gross domestic product amounted 
to 64.8 billion yuan, an increase of 10 percent over the 
previous year. In agricultural production, grain output totaled 
10.85 million metric tons despite natural disasters, an annual 
increase of 1.39 percent, the second best harvest year in the 
province's history. 
  Major industrial crops and livestock products increased. 
Township and town enterprises registered a trend of speedy 
growth, and their total income increased by 53.2 percent. 
Industrial production saw steady growth. Last year the gross 
industrial output value amounted to 52.7 billion yuan, an 
increase of 13.8 percent over the previous year. Investment in 
fixed assets in the entire society increased by 65.9 percent 
over the previous year. A number of key construction projects 
were fulfilled and put into operation as scheduled. Market 
sales gradually changed from being too brisk to being stable. 
Allowing for price increases, the total retail sales of 
commodities increased by 25.8 percent over the previous year. 
Sources of commodities were adequate. Supply was in excess of 
demand. The situation in revenue was good. Local revenues 
amounted to 20 billion yuan, an increase of 83.7 over the 
previous year. Financial order improved, civilian deposits 
increased by a wide margin, and large-scale money injections 
were initially controlled. 
  The incomes of city and town people increased and their 
standard of living improved. The per capita income of city and 
town people actually rose by 8.2 percent and peasant per capita 
net income actually increased by 2 percent.

<F P=106> [By Daniel Kwan in Guangzhou] </F>
  [Text] A major wage reform programme is expected to be 
introduced in Guangzhou this year to boost the income of the six 
million urban residents as the Chinese Government struggles to 
contain inflation below 20 percent. The proposed programme, 
likely to be introduced in June, will increase the basic 
salaries of most government cadres. 
  The central government postponed a plan to turn its 34 
million cadres into civil servants over fears that the move 
would fuel inflation. Sources said that Guangzhou was wealthy 
enough to proceed with its scheme. 
  Under the plan, the average take-home pay of government 
cadres would be raised to a level "slightly higher than" or "at 
least on par" with the amounts paid by enterprises of similar 
nature. A source said the basic wage of an average cadre could 
be increased to about 600 yuan (HK$532) a month, and a senior 
ranking official might receive more than 1,000 yuan a month. 
  However, critics fear that lower-income groups and 
pensioners 
will continue to suffer as prices continue to rise. Last year, 
the official inflation figure for Guangzhou was 24.1 percent. 
The government hoped to contain the figure at 15 percent this 
year. 
  Although city government officials admitted that prices had 
jumped 20 to 30 percent since November they claimed that the 
increases were still within the limits that the majority of 
Guangzhou residents could bear.

  [Text] Nanning Prefecture has taken flexible methods to 
enliven border trade. In 1993 the prefecture registered a total 
trade volume of 1.285 billion yuan, an increase of 20 percent 
over the previous year. Last year Nanning Prefecture's border 
trade declined for a period of time. For this reason, the 
prefectural party committee conducted market surveys, formulated 
a preferential policy, and coordinated relations between 
different departments, thus developing border trade to a new 
height. 
  Now this prefecture has taken new measures to bring about 
further development in border trade.

structural reform program. The general orientation of the 
province's monetary structural reform is that the monetary 
structure should correspond with development of a socialist 
market economy and that monetary structural reform should help 
promote Hainan's development and construction. The reform 
program has four main aspects. 
  The first is speeding up the separation of policy-type 
monetary service from commercial-type monetary service. The 
policy-type and commercial-type loans in industrial and 
commercial banks as well as in agricultural banks should be 
managed separately. [words indistinct] 
  The second is [words indistinct] 
  The third is further improving and developing the money 
market. Mutual transfer of state assets should be gradually 
introduced. Avenues should be expanded for the introduction of 
foreign capital so that the foreign exchange market will further 
develop. 
  The fourth is stepping up the computerization of Hainan's 
monetary business, forming a computerized banking system 
throughout the province, and creating conditions for automation 
in banking accounts, credits, deposits, information statistics, 
handling of business, and office work to provide all kinds of 
monetary service for economic construction.

  [Text] The Luoyang Mining Machinery Factory, China's 
largest mining machine building enterprise, yesterday changed 
its name and hung out a huge nameboard for the Heavy-Duty 
Machinery Company of the China International Trust and 
Investment Corporation [CITIC], thus formally merging into 
CITIC. CITIC General Manager Wang Jin, and Sun Changji, vice 
minister of machine building industry, attended the ceremony 
together with more than 20,000 staff members and workers, and 
cut the ribbon. 
  The Luoyang Mining Machinery Factory was one of the 156 key 
projects established by the state during the First Five-Year 
Plan. In the last 35 years, this large enterprise, with fixed 
assets of 420 million yuan, has provided a large amount of 
equipment for basic industries including the coal, 
metallurgical, building materials, mining, and electric power 
industries. But this factory lacks self-accumulation and 
self-transformation capacity, its equipment has become seriously 
obsolete and its stamina is inadequate. Therefore it is 
difficult to accomplish anything big in market competition. 
  The general manager of the the CITIC Heavy-Duty Machinery 
Company said: Introducing the shareholding system is a new way 
out for large and medium-sized state enterprises. Our purpose 
in selecting CITIC, which is a solid financial group, is to move 
ahead faster and better in introducing the shareholding system. 
  As a branch company of CITIC, the Heavy-Duty Machinery 
Company still maintains the status of legal person and assumes 
sole responsibility for its losses and profits in its 
independent operation.

  [Text] Wuhan, January 29 (XINHUA) -- Central China's Hubei 
Province is making great efforts to improve its 
telecommunications services in a bid to improve its investment 
environment. 
  According to local officials, the province has earmarked 1.2 
billion yuan in the past three years for the installation of 
more telephone lines and the opening up of related 
telecommunications services. 
  At present, the province has 690,000 telephones lines, 
including 70,000 computer-controlled ones. In 1990 the province 
had only 170,000 telephone lines. 
  In this provincial capital the telephone numbers will jump 
from six to seven digits beginning midnight March 5. 
  The increasingly improved telecommunications services have 
in 
turn promoted the opening drive in the province, and have helped 
enterprises locate in remote areas to establish closer links 
with the outside world.

<F P=106> ["Special Feature" by reporter Yuen Shan (0626 1472): "How </F>
Many Incorrupt Officials Are There in Shenzhen?"] 
  [Text] Shenzhen 25 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--It has been 
almost six months since the anticorruption struggle started in 
Shenzhen. According to the figures and conditions published by 
related departments, there are many honest officials. 
  Based on the statistics of 79 units at and above 
deputy-bureau levels directly under the Shenzhen city 
authorities and 53 enterprises directly under the city's 
jurisdiction, 126 leading bodies got a score above 80, and only 
six got a score below 79; of the 626 officials in leading posts 
of these units, 526 got a score above 80, and only 3 got a score 
below 59. 
  Another figure from a still wider range was that of the 
4,635 
officials at and above department levels, 339 believed 
themselves failing to meet the requirements through 
self-examination, accounting for 9.3 percent. 
  Failing to meet the requirements refers to those officials 
who accepted all sorts of gift money, securities (including 
"Great Wall" credit cards presented by subordinate units), 
imported liqueur, cigarettes, wristwatches and goods in various 
categories, and those "officials doing business," namely, those 
who worked as part-time board directors, deputy board directors, 
general managers and vice managers in enterprises. Should 
officials in this category return the money and gifts on their 
own, or resign their part-time offices, they would be regarded 
as having conducted self-correction. After that, they would 
have to sign a letter on the "responsibility system in 
anticorruption to insure clean government." Such "letters of 
responsibility" varied in contents with different trades, but 
will become the criteria for work of officials at various levels 
in the days to come. 
  Since last September, Shenzhen investigated and handled a 
number of major cases, with 15 suspects, who were cadres at and 
above department levels involved; in addition, 119 economic 
criminals involving corruption and bribery were apprehended. A 
number of criminals at large were rounded up, with scores of 
millions of yuan in illicit money recovered. 
  It was said the atmosphere of honesty was on the rise. 
Government departments have began to treat their guests at the 
canteen; enterprises stopped giving gifts and holding banquets 
for their opening ceremonies. The number of cadres refusing 
gift money and bribes rose by a wide margin. 
  People here believe that the anticorruption struggle has not 
been thoroughly conducted, and the tasks for the struggle 
remained arduous.

Article Type:BFN 

<F P=106> [By reporter Geng Jun (5105 6511)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 29 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--According to 
the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, from March 
1992 to the end of last year, the Shenzhen city industrial and 
commercial administration department investigated and handled a 
total of 109 cases of foreign exchange black-market transaction 
and cracked 132 "illegal foreign exchange transaction shops." 
  The State Administration for Industry and Commerce's 
analysis 
of these cases indicates the following special characteristics 
of "foreign exchange black-market transactions": 
  1. Foreign exchange transaction shops are established 
illegally and operate without licenses. All the "foreign 
exchange black- market transaction shops" that were investigated 
had not registered with the industrial and commercial 
administration department, but they dealt in illegal foreign 
exchange business under such names as "futures transaction 
department," "investment company limited," "international 
banking center," "representative office," and "liaison office." 
For example, Shihua Commodity Futures Transaction Division, 
International Banking Information Center, and Bailigao 
Investment Company Limited were all operating without 
registering with the industrial and commercial administration 
department. 
  2. They use advanced means to run illegal businesses, such 
as 
laser teleprinters and computer display units. As for 
telecommunication equipment, they use mobile phones and walkie- 
talkies. Whenever they sense any trouble, the shop owners will 
run away with account books and cash and hide out. Soon after a 
black- market shop is closed down somewhere, another new shop 
opens somewhere else. 
  3. In a certain sense they are cheating their clients. These 
illegal foreign exchange black-marketeers use official seals 
they made on their own without authorization. Claiming 
themselves to be "foreign exchange transaction agents," they 
lure clients into dealings. Usually they charge their clients 
80 to 150 yuan for transaction of a lot (1,000 shares). And 
they remit the cash they collect from their clients soon after 
transaction, while the so- called "international financial 
market information" reflected in their computers is all outdated 
information. For example, a client coming to Shenzhen from 
somewhere else in China, was lured into foreign exchange 
transaction by a "Fuxing Trading Company" and a "Zhuhai Trading 
Company," which were established by two Englishmen. He first 
invested HK$100,000 [Hong Kong dollars] in the business. Then 
the agent lied to him that his investment had earned him an 
equal amount of profit. Feeling that it was easy to make money 
from foreign exchange transactions, the investor invested 
another HK$100,000. However, a few days later, the agent lied 
to him that the foreign exchange market had slumped and all his 
capital, HK$200,000, had been lost in the business. In order to 
recover his loss, the client invested an additional HK$700,000, 
and again all his money was lost in one month. When he realized 
that this was but a fraud, the cheats had already run away with 
all the money. 
  4. The agents cheat their clients, and the clients in turn 
cheat other clients. The pay an agent gets is proportional to 
the number of his clients and the amount of transactions he 
manages to conclude. Therefore, some innocent young people 
tried very hard to push others to invest in foreign exchange 
business. Some of them first cheated their families, relatives, 
and friends, and then induced them to cheat other relatives and 
friends. Thus they started a chain of fraud. 
  The State Administration for Industry and Commerce believes 
that the main reason why "foreign exchange black-market 
transactions" persist despite repeated bans is because no strong 
action has been taken to fight these activities. The existing 
laws and regulations do not set any concrete penalties against 
black-marketeers, hence the law enforcers have no rules to 
follow in this regard.

<F P=106> [By reporter Yuan Shan (0626 1472)] </F>
  [Text] Shenzhen, 28 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Some 
foreign businessmen in Shenzhen have become very mean and 
operated in a barbaric way, causing endless complaints from 
workers. 
  So-called becoming very mean and operating in a barbaric way 
refers to the situation in which some foreign businessmen do not 
care about China's laws and regulations, do not respect workers, 
and do not go through formalities when hiring workers; they beat 
and swear at workers, treat them badly, embezzle their wages and 
own them remuneration, and let them work in poor working 
conditions. 
  Recently, a Taiwan-funded footwear company with limited 
liability in Songgang, Baoan District, Shenzhen, has been 
sanctioned for violation of the relevant regulations in China. 
According to information, each month, the company deducted from 
every worker 20 yuan of deposit money, and 11 yuan of management 
fee, but it did not refund the money to the workers 16 months 
after the agreed upon time. The average overtime work of a 
worker is 150 hours every month, but the overtime pay is only 1 
yuan per hour. What is particularly mean is that workers are 
not allowed to go out of the door of the factory during daytime, 
or to visit one another; they are not allowed to talk when 
eating meals, and those who break the rule will be fined 30-50 
yuan. When they come to work or leave the workplace, or when 
they enter and leave their dormitories, or when they go to the 
canteen, there are fixed routes for them to walk, and once they 
trespass over the line, they will be fined or asked to stand for 
a period. The incidents of beating and swearing at workers have 
often happened. An electric worker whose name is Zhou was 
suspected of stealing by a responsible person of the company, 
and although no evidence against him has not found, Zhou has 
been beaten and his head bled. 
  After an investigation, the Shenzhen City's Labor Bureau and 
the trade union have sanctioned the company. 
  In January this year, in just 10 days or so, Shenzhen City's 
Labor Bureau received over 160 complaint letters sent by 
workers, and met 370 people who came to complain. The 
complaints mainly involved wages and project remunerations not 
paid by bosses to workers, resignation allowances not paid to 
workers after they resigned, security deposits the workers paid 
at the time they were hired by factories were not paid back to 
them, barbaric management, maltreatment of workers, and so on. 
Among all these phenomena, the phenomenon of outstanding 
payments to temporary workers is very serious. According to the 
statistics provided by Luowu District Labor Disputes Arbitration 
Office, in the district alone, the outstanding wages amount to 
more than 100,000 yuan.

<F P=106> [By Wang Jie (3769 3381): "The Eighth Plenary Session of </F>
the Fifth Inner Mongolia Autonomous Regional CPC Committee Ends 
Satisfactorily"] 
  [Text] After seven days in session, the Eighth (Enlarged) 
Plenary Session of the Fifth Regional Party Committee 
satisfactorily ended on 28 December. 
  Present at the closing ceremony were Wang Qun, Wu Liji, Qian 
Fenyong, Bai Enpei, Wang Zhan, Geriletu, Yang Enbo, and 
Wuyunqimuge. 
  Wu Liji made a summing-up speech. Wang Zhan chaired the 
session. 
  The session approved the report entitled "Expand the Extent 
of Reform, Accelerate the Economic Development, and Strive To 
Create a New Situation in Setting Up the Socialist Market 
Economic System" made by Comrade Wang Qun on behalf of the 
standing committee of the regional party committee. 
  The session called on the party organizations and the broad 
masses of Communist Party members across the region to firmly 
remember the purpose of serving the people, regard the task of 
ceaselessly liberating and developing productive forces and 
making the people of various nationalities rich and happy as 
their own duty, further strengthen the sense of responsibility 
to history and the sense of urgency for the times under the 
guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the 14th 
Party Congress, unite with and guide the people of various 
nationalities across the region, emancipate the mind, keep 
forging ahead, work with one heart and soul, conduct pioneering 
work arduously, and fight to create a new situation in setting 
up the socialist market economic system and promoting sustained, 
rapid, and sound development of the economy. 
  Wu Liji said in his speech: "This is a policy-making session 
to comprehensively implement the guidelines of the third plenary 
session of the 14th party Central Committee, to set up new 
systems, and to create a new situation and set up a mobilization 
meeting to emancipate the mind, seek unity of thought, promote 
reform, accelerate the pace of development, and welcome the key 
year. 
  After analyzing the development situation ahead of the 
region, Wu Liji said: At present, our region is confronted with 
five favorable opportunities. First, the international 
environment has brought extremely good advantages to us in 
regards to further expanding the scale of opening up and 
accelerating the development pace. Second, the state cancels, 
in a step-by-step manner, the dual-pricing system and decontrols 
the prices of the majority of energy resources and raw 
materials. The region's long-term phenomena in which the value 
of raw materials deviates from their prices tend to have been 
alleviated. A large number of enterprises engaged in the 
production of the products of these kinds will create better 
economic results through market competition. Third, through the 
readjustment of the product mix and the reform of the old 
investment system, the central and western parts of the region 
have increased their input in the development of energy 
resources and raw materials. All this has created a favorable 
environment for realizing the strategy of transforming natural 
resources. Fourth, along with the implementation of the tax 
distribution system, the state will gradually enhance its 
financial resources. This has created prerequisite conditions 
for increasing the input to the undeveloped areas through the 
implementation of the system wherein the central fiscal 
authority returns and transfers payments to local authorities. 
Fifth, through the efforts made over the past 40 years or so, 
our region has had good foundations in materials, technology, 
and development. Therefore, our region should abide by the 
following guiding ideology for economic development in 1994: 
Comprehensively implement the guidelines of the third plenary 
session of the 14th party Central Committee and the eighth 
(enlarged) plenary session of the fifth regional party 
committee, persist in the basic line of the party, expand the 
extent of reform, vigorously readjust the industrial structure 
and the product mix, and increase economic results. On the 
premise of continuously grasping the basic industries and the 
pillar industries, we should positively cultivate and develop 
new economic growth points and promote better and faster 
development of the national economy. 
  Wu Liji pointed out: According to this guiding ideology, the 
region has tentatively set 1994's major economic and social 
development targets as follows: We should guarantee a 10 
percent increase of GNP and strive to increase 12 percent. The 
total agricultural output value should increase by 6 percent, 
the total industrial output value should increase by 14 percent, 
and the investment in fixed assets should reach 20.25 billion 
yuan. We should guarantee an increase of $1.4 billion in total 
export and import trade volume and strive to create $1.5 
billion. We should strive to create 5.5 billion yuan in 
revenues. The index of retail sales of commodities should be 
controlled within 10 percent, the per capita income of the 
peasants and the herdsmen should increase by more than 100 yuan, 
and the population natural growth rate should be controlled 
within 13.5 per thousand. 
  Wu Liji said: Through full discussions, the delegates 
maintained that we must pay attention to and embody the 
following principles in order to realize the 1994 economic and 
social development targets: That development is an essential 
criterion should be persisted in. We should try every possible 
means to accelerate the pace of development. We should 
persistently take the increase in economic results as a key 
link, persist in the principle of taking the overall situation 
into consideration and ensuring key projects, adhere to the 
"three-conducive" standards, and persist in the idea of 
self-reliance and arduous struggle. 
  Focusing on the general target of setting up the socialist 
market economic system and comprehensively promoting the 
progress of reform according to the arrangements of the central 
authorities and in line with the provincial actual conditions is 
the important subject discussed at this session. Wu Liji 
pointed out: The 1994 reform priorities are as follows: In 
regard to the reform of the financial and tax system, we should 
carry out the tax assignment system on the basis of a rational 
division of power between central and local authorities. In 
regard to the reform of the banking system, we should separate 
policy-lending banking from commercial banking. In regard to 
the reform of the investment system, we should gradually 
establish risk liabilities for corporate investment and bank 
credits. In regard to the reform of the export trade system, we 
should cancel the mandatory planning of the foreign trade 
enterprises and further decontrol, in a well-planned manner, the 
import and export commodity managerial rights. The prices of 
the majority of production factors should be decontrolled in a 
step-by-step manner; and the grain and cotton purchasing prices 
should rise. Enterprises should set up a modern enterprise 
system characterized by clearly defined property rights, rights, 
and responsibility, separating the government administration 
from enterprise management; and scientific management. In 
regard to the reform of the social guaranteeing system, we 
should perfect the system of providing for the aged staff and 
workers and the system of medical insurance for staff and 
workers. In regard to the reform of the urban housing system, 
we should focus on marketing public houses; pay equal attention 
to sales, rent, and construction; and accelerate the 
commercialization and socialization of houses. 
  According to the guidelines of Comrade Wang Qun's report and 
the discussion situation of session, Wu Liji stressed the 
necessity to attend to the 1994 work. First, we should focus on 
changing the enterprise mechanisms and win the general war of 
reform. Due to the fact that the focal and difficult point of 
the 1994 economic structural reform is to blaze a new trails in 
the enterprise system, we must adopt major measures, go into 
mass action, and strive to make a big breakthrough in this 
regard. At the time of grasping the enterprise reform, we 
should continue to regard the increase in the industrial 
production as the focal point of the region's economic work and 
positively readjust the industrial structure and the product mix 
according to the market demands. 
  Second, we should vigorously develop the economy of the 
rural 
and pastoral areas and strive to increase the income of the 
peasants and the herdsmen. The focus of the work of 
agriculture, animal husbandry, the rural and pastoral areas, and 
the peasants and the herdsmen is to increase the income of the 
peasants and the herdsmen. According to the requirements of the 
two-stage fighting targets, the per capita net income of the 
peasants and the herdsmen must increase by more than 200 yuan in 
the next two years. The party committees and governments at 
various levels should continue to persist in the idea that 
agriculture and animal husbandry are the foundation of the 
national economy, put agriculture and animal husbandry in the 
primary position of the economic work, stabilize the party's 
basic policies toward the rural and pastoral areas, deepen the 
rural and pastoral areas, and promote the overall development of 
the rural and pastoral economy. All leagues, cities, banners, 
and counties should focus the work toward banners and counties 
on grasping town and township enterprises and ensure that town 
and township enterprises really play a key role in developing 
the banner and county economy. 
  He also urged to conscientiously attend to the financial and 
tax reform, realistically improve and strengthen the financial 
and tax work, further expand the scale of opening to the outside 
world and developing the lateral economic cooperation, 
conscientiously implement the strategy of relying on science and 
technology to rejuvenate Shandong, realistically grasp various 
social undertakings, and conscientiously arrange the people's 
livelihood. 
  Wu Liji concluded: The reform and development tasks in the 
next year and in the foreseeable future are extremely arduous. 
The party and government leaders at various levels across the 
region should hold themselves responsible to the party and the 
people; further strengthen and improve the leadership over 
reform, opening up, and economic construction; greatly change 
and improve their ideas, work style, and work methods; and 
regard the year of 1994 as one to emancipate the mind, change 
work style, and implement tasks.

<F P=106> [By reporter Wang Rantong (3769 3544 17490): "Clearly </F>
Understand the Situation, Strengthen Unity, Work Hard, Overcome 
Difficulties, Accelerate Legislation, and Promote Reform"] 
  [Text] Wang Qun, secretary of the regional party committee 
and chairman of the regional people's congress standing 
committee, held talks with members of the regional people's 
congress standing committee at the Fifth Session of the Eighth 
Regional People's Congress standing committee held recently. He 
emphatically pointed out: In implementing the guidelines of the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th Party Central Committee and of 
the Eighth Enlarged Plenary Session of the Fifth Regional Party 
Committee, it is necessary to clearly understand the situation, 
strengthen unity, engage in arduous struggle, overcome 
difficulties, strengthen the building of socialist democracy and 
the legal system, and promote the establishment of the socialist 
market economic structure. 
  At the forums held on the evening of 7 January and on the 
afternoon of 9 January, Liu Zhenyi, Zhang Yingqi, Liu Zhen, Yang 
Xilin, Jia Cai, Yu Xinglong, Wang Tianen, Yi Junhua, Wang 
Xiumei, Liu Xiaowang, Wuerjilang, Liu Zuohui, Yun Gui, Feng 
Yuqiang, and Zhou Guangde and other comrades gave speeches one 
after another on the current situation, the hot topics of the 
people's concern, economic construction, and the building of 
democracy and the legal system. 
  At the forums, Comrade Wang Qun frequently chipped in and 
gave speeches. 
  Wang Qun said: Comrades have offered many very constructive 
suggestions. You have done a lot of investigation and research 
work, have the practical situation well in hand, and reflected 
the opinions and demands of the masses. 
  Wang Qun pointed out: The situation in our region is 
currently excellent. This is the common understanding of all. 
However, there are still many difficulties and problems that 
merit the great attention of the regional party committee, the 
regional people's congress standing committee, and the regional 
government. Regarding the existing problems, the most crucial 
issue involved is to treat them correctly and solve them 
properly. For example, the problem on the gap between the 
development rate of our region and that of the developed areas 
must be solved with the common efforts of the higher and the 
lower levels of the whole region. Our Inner Mongolia has a great 
momentum for development, and our development pace will not be 
slow in the days to come. First, we have a definite foundation 
and a clearly-defined correct development strategy; second, the 
state's input in Inner Mongolia is very big; and third, the 
state has adopted special policies in the border minority areas. 
We should have full confidence in narrowing the gap between our 
region and the developed areas. 
  Wang Qun stressed: Leaders at all levels should pay great 
attention to the pricing issue, control the prices 
realistically, and strengthen management. 
  Wang Qun stressed: We should resolutely and continuously 
grasp the anticorruption struggle because this is a major affair 
which may help us win the trust from the masses. It is 
necessary to estimate problems on corruption in a fact-seeking 
manner. While recognizing the basic fact that the main aspect 
of our party is good, most of the party members and cadres are 
clean and honest in performing official duties, and the corrupt 
elements inside the party only account for a small number, we 
should also fully understand the seriousness and harmfulness of 
the corrupt phenomenon inside the party, realistically regard 
this struggle as a strategic task, and grasp it unswervingly 
until good results are achieved. 
  Wang Qun pointed out: We should recognize that the current 
temporary difficulties are problems which we have met on our 
road of advance in the course of reform, and that they can be 
solved. All of you should correctly approach these problems, 
and distinguish between the major and minor aspects and the 
essence. We should solve these problems with the ideology of 
serving the people wholeheartedly and on our own initiative in 
an effort to promote reform, development, and stability. 
  Wang Qun pointed out: We should give full play to the role 
of 
the people's congress standing committees in the course of the 
four modernization drives. In accordance with the decision of 
the chairmanship meeting of the regional people's congress 
standing committee, we will organize deputies of the National 
People's Congress in our region and some regional people's 
congress deputies to inspect leagues and cities in the near 
future. We will solve the practical problems concerning the 
people's production and living in the course of implementing the 
guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party 
Central Committee. 
  Wang Qun called on leaders at all levels, all trades and 
professions, and all sectors to act in line with the guidelines 
of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Party Central Committee 
and of the Eighth Enlarged Plenary Session of the Fifth Regional 
Party Committee, pay attention to the situation and unity, boost 
enthusiasm, overcome difficulties, accelerate reform, and 
develop the economy. 
  Wang Qun called on the people's congress standing committees 
to act in line with the objective of building the socialist 
market economic structure, coordinately carry out our 
legislative policies and reform policies, accelerate the pace of 
legislation, enhance the legislative and law enforcement level, 
and promote the establishment of the socialist market economic 
structure. It is necessary to conscientiously and repeatedly 
study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, arm our minds and guide our work with the theory 
on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, emancipate 
the mind, and seek truth from facts. We should also give less 
empty talks, do more practical work, actively support and 
supervise the "government, the higher people's court and the 
people's procuratorate" to successfully carry out their work, 
give full play to the role of the people's congress standing 
committees as the organs of state power in the localities, and 
enable the people congress system to play a greater role in the 
course of building the two civilizations.

<F P=106> [By reporter Mu Yajun (4476 0068 6511) and Correspondent </F>
Zhong He (6988 7729): "Clearly Understand the Situation, 
Reinforce Confidence, Severely Punish the Corrupt, and Blaze New 
Trials"] 
  [Text] In his important speech made on the afternoon of 8 
January at the meeting of teachers and students of institutions 
of higher learning in Hohhot, Wang Qun, secretary of the 
regional party committee, stressed the need to correctly 
understand the current situation and the development prospects 
of the region, further strengthen lofty faith in building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, launching the 
anticorruption campaign in a penetrating and sustained manner, 
continuously deepening the reform of educational structure, and 
mobilizing people of all nationalities in the region to enhance 
morale, pioneer the road of advance, and struggle to build a 
united, prosperous, and civilized Inner Mongolia. 
  Wang Zhan, deputy secretary of the regional party committee, 
presided over the meeting. Qian Fenyong, Wuyunqimuge, and Zhao 
Zhihong attended the meeting. Over 1,300 persons from 13 
institutions of higher learning in Hohhot participated. 
  Wang Qun pointed out: The 15 years since the commencement of 
reform and opening up is a period characterized by large-scale 
reform and large-scale development and is a period in which the 
economy and society has developed most rapidly and the masses of 
all nationalities in urban and rural areas have obtained most 
practical benefits in comparison to any other period in the 
region's history. Major indicators are: The region's national 
economy has embarked on a completely new period of development; 
overall economic strength has been enhanced obviously; 
agriculture and animal husbandry has continued to develop 
rapidly; overall production capacity has embarked on a new 
stage; industrial production has increased in a steady and 
sustained manner; the non-state-owned economy, and township and 
town enterprises in particular, has witnessed high-speed growth 
trends; the scale of opening to the outside world has been 
expanding; the export-oriented economy has witnessed 
breakthroughs; education, science, technology, and public health 
undertakings have developed vigorously; income of urban and 
rural residents has doubled and redoubled; people's living 
standards have improved clearly; various difficulties and 
problems occurring in the process of reform and development have 
gradually been solved; and the overall index of social and 
economic development ranks 15th in the country. The increased 
speed in the fixed assets investment, the fact that some newly 
built coal, power, and chemical industrial projects will soon be 
put into production, the renovation through "grafting" of 
state-owned enterprises, and the overall development of township 
and town enterprises as well as the non-publicly owned economy 
will certainly play a positive and promoting role in 
accelerating the region's economic development. So long as the 
people of all nationalities in the region firmly seize the 
opportunity provided by the opening up of the border areas and 
by the westward shifting of the state economic development 
strategy, and so long as we aim at the goal of building a 
socialist market economic system and work hard with one heart 
and one mind, the advantages in our region's natural resources, 
geological relations, and policies will be brought into full 
play, our economy will develop even more rapidly, and the gaps 
between our region and the developed areas will be narrowed 
gradually. Comrade Wang Qun also made specific analysis and 
explanations of the issue of the gaps between the region and 
other places and the issue of financial and tax reform, unpaid 
wages in some areas, and pricing reform. He also set forth some 
measures and demands for solving these problems. 
  On ways to strengthen confidence in socialism, Wang Qun 
pointed out: In contemporary China, only Deng Xiaoping's theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics can solve 
problems related to the future and destiny of socialism. We 
should profoundly study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping, persist in the party's basic line of "one 
central task and two basic points" without wavering for 100 
years, and further strengthen the lofty faith in building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. All comrades, 
particularly the young generation that strides from this century 
to the next, should make due contribution to the socialist 
modernization drive that has a bearing on the future and destiny 
of China. 
  Wang Qun said: Anticorruption is a hot social issue on which 
the masses have expressed strong comments. Whether we can 
firmly and unswervingly persist in and achieve obvious results 
in the anticorruption campaign is not only a question with which 
the masses are much concerned and worried but also a major event 
that has a bearing on the success or failure in reform and on 
the destiny of the country. We should realistically appraise 
the corruption in the party's present situation. We should not 
only see the basic fact that the main trend of our party is 
good, most party members and cadres are honest and clean in 
performing official duties, and corrupt elements within the 
party comprise only a very small part. We should also fully 
understand the importance and harmfulness of the corrupt 
phenomenon within the party and actually carry out the struggle 
against corruption in a resolute and unremitting way by 
regarding it as a strategic task. Before the Spring Festival, 
we should accelerate the pace of handling cases and make public 
a number of appalling and major cases to inspire the people and 
to warn others against following bad examples, on the basis of 
extensively launching the education on opposing corruption and 
advocating administrative honesty and consolidating and 
developing the results achieved at the present stage. At the 
same time, we should guard against the plot hatched by hostile 
forces at home and abroad, of intentionally defaming communist 
party and socialism. 
  Wang Qun pointed out: Education is of fundamental importance 
to the fulfillment of our great long-range mission. Party 
committees and governments at all levels should list education 
as a strategic emphasis of economic and social development and 
give rise to a fine situation in which the whole party pays 
attention to education and the whole society runs education. 
Under the current situation characterized by financial 
shortage, we should actually ensure the development of education 
on a priority basis and truly do good things and run tangible 
things for developing educational undertakings. We should exert 
great efforts in tackling difficulties and problems that emerge 
in developing education and make great efforts to improve and 
enhance teachers' working conditions and remunerations to 
stabilize the ranks of teachers. We should constantly deepen 
the educational structure reform, boldly explore new ways to run 
education well, vigorously train the skilled persons urgently 
needed by the four modernizations, and give full play to their 
positive role in carrying out reform, opening up, and economic 
construction in order to make new and even greater contributions 
to invigorating and developing the region.

  [Text] Beijing, February 1 (XINHUA) -- Both the 
Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the 
Association of Relations across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) of the 
mainland reiterated that, in principle, all hijackers should be 
repatriated, Tang Shubei, executive vice-president of ARATS said 
here today. 
  Tang held the first meeting this afternoon with Chiao 
Jen-ho, 
vice-chairman and secretary general of SEF, who arrived in 
Beijing yesterday. Their meeting lasted two hours. 
  The two organizations also agreed that issues concerning 
economic exchanges between the two sides across the Taiwan 
Strait should be put on the agenda, tang said at a press 
conference right after his meeting with Chiao. 
  According to Tang, they reached understanding on two 
important issues. First, being two authorized non-governmental 
organizations, the two organs will continue to insist on the 
unofficial nature of their agreements. Secondly, neither side 
should force upon the other its political viewpoint through 
discussions of such issues as "repatriation of hijackers", in 
other words, political viewpoint of one side should not be 
included in agreements of the two sides. 
  He said that the understanding would contribute to the 
discussion of the issue of the repatriation of hijackers. 
  Both sides regarded the framework for a repatriation 
agreement the two organizations reached in Taipei as a positive 
beginning. The remaining issue of literal expression should be 
resolved on its basis, Tang said. 
  "We should avoid sensitive political issues and search for 
methods of literal expression acceptable to both sides," Tang 
said. 
  He said that some progress has been made on the issue during 
their previous talks in Xiamen and Taipei last year. He 
believed that it is absolutely possible to solve the divergence 
on the issue with efforts from both sides. 
  Tang said that ARATS, as a non-governmental organization, 
was 
not empowered to discuss such political issues as "judicial 
administration right" and such issues should be avoided in the 
discussions. 
  Tang said that avoiding the issue is not a matter of 
disrespect, because he is not authorized to discuss the issue. 
  Now that both sides should avoid sensitive political issues 
in discussing routine affairs, legal issues no doubt should not 
be excluded, Tang said. 
  He said that the two organs have decided to set up two 
groups 
to discuss routine affairs and some issues concerning economic 
exchanges. 
  According to Tang Shubei, the Chinese Mainland has drafted a 
law to protect Taiwan investment, which will be submitted to the 
National People's Congress for deliberation. 
  "We hope that Taiwan may consider the opinions of the 
mainland on the basis of mutual benefit," Tang said. 
  Tang said that Taiwan should cancel restrictions on making 
investment in the mainland and open its market for manufactured 
or partially-manufactured goods of the mainland and the labor 
market. 
  Tang said that the possibility of a non-governmental 
agreement on such issues between ARATS and SEF is not excluded.

<F P=106> [Speech by Sun Weiben, secretary of the provincial party </F>
committee, at the rural work conference held by the provincial 
party committee on 4 December, entitled: "Strengthen the 
Agricultural Foundation Status and Accelerate the Pace of Rural 
Reform and Development"] 
  [Text] The central rural work conference held not long ago 
and the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee 
are of great significance in mobilizing the whole party to 
unswervingly pay attention to agriculture, peasants and rural 
work, strengthening the agricultural foundation status, and 
accelerating the pace of rural reform and development. The 
major tasks of this rural work conference held by the provincial 
party committee are to further implement the guidelines of the 
central rural work conference and the third plenary session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee, analyze the agricultural and 
rural situation under the socialist market economic conditions, 
study and devise plans for strengthening the agricultural 
foundation status, deepen rural reform and comprehensively 
develop the rural economic work tasks during the last two years 
of the Eighth Five-Year Plan, and push the rural economy to a 
new stage. 
<H3>  1. Correctly Analyze the Agricultural and Rural Situation 
and Realistically Strengthen the Agricultural Foundation Status </H3>
  Since the third plenary session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee, our province has witnessed tremendous and profound 
changes in agriculture and in the rural areas and achieved 
historical progress in the rural economy. The total value of 
agricultural production has shown an annual average increase of 
11.4 percent, agricultural labor productivity has shown an 
annual average increase of 14.7 percent, and the average per 
capita net income of peasants has shown an annual increase of 
8.3 percent and the food and clothing problems in the rural 
areas have been basically solved. The eighth plenary session of 
the sixth provincial party committee held in 1991 
comprehensively summarized the agricultural and rural work 
during the 13 years of reform and opening up, raised the 
proposal of regarding the goal of becoming well-off as the 
banner to guide rural work in line with the characteristics that 
the rural economy has entered the stage of commodity production, 
and defined the guiding ideology of "readjusting the structure, 
raising efficiency, relying on science and education and 
invigorating agriculture." After the eighth plenary session of 
the sixth provincial party committee, the party committees and 
governments at all levels adopted a series of important measures 
to strengthen the agricultural foundation status and to 
accelerate the development of the rural economy. We should 
conscientiously implement the party's various rural principles 
and policies; stabilize and improve the family-based 
output-related contract responsibility system; establish the 
main market operational status of peasants, township enterprises 
and all sorts of rural economic organizations; strictly clear up 
the burdens of peasants; set ceiling prices for the means of 
production for agricultural use; exert efforts to solve the 
problem of issuing IOU's for purchases of agricultural products; 
protect and mobilize the production enthusiasm of peasants; 
formulate and implement the strategic plans of coordinating 
grain and livestock production with township enterprises, 
foreign trade with industry and agriculture, agriculture with 
science and education, and urban areas with rural areas; 
flexibly readjust the rural economic structure of production 
set-up and comprehensively develop the county economy; gradually 
decontrol the prices of grains and agricultural products; strive 
to organize agricultural production in line with market 
guidance; cultivate and build a market system for agricultural 
products; place township enterprises in a strategic position of 
the rural economy; promote the shareholding cooperative system; 
establish small industrial areas, link the urban areas with the 
rural areas; give priority to solving the difficult problems of 
funds, items, and personnel and promote a sustained and speedy 
increase of township enterprises; uphold the strategy of using 
science and education to invigorate agriculture; make overall 
plans to combine agriculture with science and education; carry 
out comprehensive agricultural development and enable 
agriculture to move toward the orientation of high-yield, high 
quality, and highly-efficient farming; give great emphasis to 
some policies and investments; support rich counties to 
accelerate development, and support poor counties to shake off 
poverty and become rich; give play to the advantage of border 
development; establish farm products export, production, and 
processing bases and actively develop export-oriented farming; 
expand the degree of changing the operational mechanism of 
industrial and commercial enterprises; transform county-run 
industrial units into state-owned people-run units or 
people-owned and people-run units and enhance the vitality of 
county economy; consolidate and improve the rural party 
branches, perfect village supporting organizations, conduct 
activities on running townships in line with the law; conduct 
ideological education focusing on enhancing the sense of 
commodity and strengthening the confidence in becoming well-off 
and strengthen the building of spiritual civilization in the 
rural areas and of the party's grass-roots organizations; 
strengthen the functions of counties to take overall 
responsibility over local economic work; change from simply 
grasping agriculture into comprehensively developing all rural 
industries and from paying attention to financial revenue into 
cultivating financial resources and enable all kinds of economic 
sectors and all industries in counties to compete with one 
another during development; adopt the work method of using 
typical cases to lead the way, giving different guidance 
according to the merits of different cases and carrying out the 
work in the whole region; and give specific work guidance 
according to the characteristics of different economic 
ownerships and regional development and raise the overall level 
of rural work. 
  We can say that in the past two years, the province has had 
a 
clear idea about rural development, effectively organized and 
guided agricultural and rural work, made the biggest strides for 
rural reform, and made the fastest economic development. In 
1993, the province turned out 23.91 billion kilograms of grain, 
setting a historical record. The total grain output increased, 
the grain structure was improved, the grain quality was 
upgraded, and the efficiency from grain output increased. The 
diversified economy dominated by animal husbandry was 
comprehensively developed. The diversified economic output 
value accounted for more than 30 percent of the total 
agricultural output value. Town and township enterprises 
developed at a rapid speed. In the first 10 months of this 
year, the town and township enterprises' output value, profits, 
and tax revenues respectively increased by 68.1 percent, 71.3 
percent, and 75.2 percent. The town and township enterprises 
have become a half of the rural economy. Great headway was made 
in export-oriented agriculture. The proportion of farm and 
sideline products in the foreign export trade volume was close 
to 30 percent. Each of the five major farm products created more 
than $10 million foreign exchange from exports. The per capita 
net income of the peasants reached about 1,000 yuan. The 
increase rate of the per capita net income of the peasants was 
higher than the national average level for two consecutive 
years. The total output value of the rural society increased by 
double digits. The county economy made more contributions to 
the province. More than 70 percent of the newly added portions 
of the total output value of society were created by the county 
economy. Generally speaking, the agricultural and rural 
situation continued to develop along with a good orientation. 
  Although the province has made great headway in agriculture 
and rural work and the agricultural and rural work has tended to 
develop in a sustained, fast, and healthy manner, many new 
conditions and problems emerged in the course of system reform. 
We are still confronted with many contradictions that should 
urgently be solved in the course of realizing the fairly 
well-off target. The main contradictions are as follows: Our 
province has relatively abundant natural resources, but the 
degree of overall development is not high. Our province is a 
key grain production area as well as a large agricultural 
province. The output of major farm and sideline products ranks 
the province among the first 10 in the whole country. The deep 
development and the overall utilization of the farm and sideline 
products cannot keep pace with the increase in the total output. 
The province is still in the stage of producing raw materials 
and preliminarily processing major products. As a result, the 
rural economic results are reduced by a big margin. The 
commodity rate of the farm and sideline products continue to 
increase when the development and setup of markets are 
relatively slow. More than 60 percent of the province's farm 
and sideline products are marketable. Due to the failure to 
develop and set up markets and effectively coordinate production 
and management with domestic and foreign markets and affected by 
the fact that the supply and demand of ordinary farm and 
sideline products are even at home, the phenomena that the 
circulation of farm and sideline products is blocked still 
prominent exist. Thus, it is difficult to make the rural 
economic operation suit the demands for socialized production 
and unified markets. Due to the failure to effectively guide 
and organize the rural decentralized management, agricultural 
production and management are neither keen to the reaction of 
markets nor closely related to the market demands. As a result, 
it is difficult to have some products become readily marketable, 
to make some natural resources gain economic advantages, and to 
create large-scale economic results from the rural economy. Due 
to the slow development of nonagriculture, a large number of 
agricultural laborers have become unemployed. Affected by the 
traditional agricultural forms and restricted by production 
conditions, we made a late start in developing such 
nonagricultural industries as rural circulation trade, labor 
service trade, and town and township enterprises. As a result, 
increasingly more surplus labor forces due to the decrease in 
the per capita are transferred to other jobs at a slow speed. 
With a weak sense of the commodity economy, the nonagricultural 
industries lack motivation for development. With dual risks, 
the agricultural front lacks appropriate support and protection 
measures. Due to the insufficient input to agriculture, the 
weak infrastructural facilities, the high agricultural social 
benefit, and the low comparable effect, we are confronted with 
increasingly more risks in resisting natural disasters and 
developing markets. The mechanisms for supporting and 
protecting agriculture have not yet taken shape. So, the price 
difference between industrial and agricultural products become 
widened, the per capita income of the peasants increase at a 
slow speed, the rural economy is short of reserve strength for 
development, and the tasks for improving agricultural production 
conditions become heavier. These contradictions and problems 
indicate that if we fail to consider agriculture and rural work 
from a high level, to emphatically enhance the basic position of 
agriculture, and to optimize the structure of rural industries, 
it will be impossible for the rural economy to have a sustained 
and rapid growth. If we fail to unswervingly orient the rural 
economy onto the track of the market economy and to organize 
agricultural production and management truly according to the 
law of the market economy, it will be impossible for the rural 
economy to maintain its protracted vigor. These contradictions 
and problems, which in some cases have cropped up or developed 
in the course of shifting systems, must be dealt with by relying 
on deepening the reform. Those that have been caused by 
underdeveloped productive forces require us to fully regard 
development as a mandatory principle. 
  Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. 
Improving agriculture to a new level represents a foundation 
for fulfilling the second and third strategic targets, and 
increasing per peasant income represents a foundation for the 
society as a whole to reach the better-off level. The CPC 
Central Committee and the State Council have always attached 
great importance on agriculture and on problems encountered by 
rural areas and peasants. After the rural reform program was 
personally led and organized by Comrade Deng Xiaoping -- which 
has a historical significance -- he presented a series of 
brilliant expositions on rural reform and development and 
pointed out that the basic position of agriculture in the 
national economy will never be changed; that rural stability can 
decide the stability of the country as a whole; and that rural 
reform can affect and promote urban reforms. He also pointed 
out that agriculture is not only an important economic issue, 
but also an important political one; in developing the rural 
economy, we should rely first on the policies, second on science 
and technology, and third on inputs; and that it is imperative 
to enhance the party's leadership over agriculture and the rural 
work. In line with the persistent thinking of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping, the third-generation central leading collective with 
Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has enhanced the agricultural 
position; developed the rural economy; and protected peasants' 
interests over the past four years by adopting many important 
and major measures. Heilongjiang is a large province that is 
endowed with agricultural resources and its rural economy and 
county economy occupy an important position in the province's 
economic pattern. It has more new economic growing points than 
other provinces, which represents the part that has large 
potential and vigor in affecting the economic development 
throughout the province. Only by boosting the rural economy can 
we promote the province's economy to achieve faster and better 
development. The rural economy is encountering an opportunity 
in which its development can be quickened. Along with 
implementing the spirit of the central rural work conference and 
the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee, the understanding of units from top to bottom across 
the province regarding the enhancement of the basic position of 
agriculture will become more clear and definite; their 
confidence in successfully conducting agriculture and rural work 
will be further enhanced; and agriculture, peasants, and rural 
work will be emphasized. The central and provincial authorities 
have adopted a series of important measures and every possible 
way and means to develop the rural economy and to increase 
peasants' income. All of this will further bring into play the 
enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants, enable agricultural 
production to exert more potential, have the province's rural 
commodity economy achieve greater development, enable the 
economic and industrial structures to become rational, obviously 
upgrade the comprehensive productive capability, and have the 
province basically possess the material foundation for achieving 
sustained and fast development. We must seize the currently 
favorable opportunity. In line with the demands of the CPC 
Central Committee and the State Council, we should deeply 
understand and implement the important expositions of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping with regard to agriculture and rural work; 
overcome the blind optimism on the consecutive bumper harvests; 
prevent the trend of neglecting agriculture; and realistically 
enhance the agricultural production and the rural work. We 
should also do a good job in organizing the rural reform of 1994 
and the enforcement of tasks for developing agriculture and 
strive to enable the rural economy to be improved to a new level 
during the "Eight Five-Year Plan" period and to have the rural 
outlook be improved. This requires us to resolutely and 
unswervingly implement the principle of regarding agriculture as 
a foundation, to unswervingly place agriculture on the first 
position of economic work, to continuously hold high the banner 
of becoming better-off, to accelerate the establishment of 
economic operation mechanism that is suitable to the demands of 
the socialist market economy, to quicken the development of 
rural productive forces and the county economy, and to enable 
rural areas and peasants to become wealthy as soon as possible. 
<H3>  2. Deepen the Rural Economic Restructuring and Turn Rural 
Economy to the Socialist Market Economy Before Others </H3>
  The central rural work conference and the third plenary 
session of the 14th CPC Central Committee have already defined 
the objectives and general ideas for the rural reform. In line 
with the demands of the central authorities, we must accelerate 
the pace of rural reform, with focus on stabilizing the rural 
management system, cultivating the mainstay of market, improving 
market system, and strengthening macroeconomic regulation and 
control. At the same time, we must rapidly establish a rural 
economic managerial system and operational mechanism that are 
suitable for the socialist market economy. 
  A. We should stabilize and perfect the rural managerial 
system, energetically develop the shareholding cooperative 
economy, and cultivate and expand the mainstay of market. The 
household-based output-related contract responsibility system 
and the dual management system that integrates household 
operation with collective operation are the basic policy of the 
party in the countryside as well as the basic economic system in 
the countryside, and thus they must be carried out protractedly. 
The originally defined land contract relations in various 
localities should be stabilized and extended for another 30 
years without changes. The period of contracts of a development 
nature, such as reclaiming barren land, building forest land, 
preventing the land from becoming sandy, and improving the 
fertility of soil, should be extended for another 50 years. 
Within the contracted period, we should carry out the method of 
"increasing persons but not land and reducing persons but not 
land." In conducting the appropriate-scale management of land, 
we should establish a land turnover mechanism compatible with 
the demands of market economy on the prerequisite of developing 
non-agricultural industries accordingly and promoting reasonable 
flow of rural labor forces. This requires us to consolidate 
ownership, stabilize contract right, enliven the right to use, 
and allow peasants to transfer on a paid basis, to lease, and to 
mortgage the land use right and to buy shares in order to enable 
peasants to independently solve the contradictions between 
different persons in line with the changes in management 
conditions and in accordance with the law of market and in order 
to raise the distribution efficiency of land resources. The 
non-agricultural industries develop more rapidly than others. 
The localities, that have conditions in various fields, may 
carry out the appropriate-scale management in line with the 
wills of peasants by proceeding from reality, but should not 
force all the peasants to join the management. We should strive 
to enhance the economic strength of the village-level 
collectives and strengthen the overall planning and service 
functions of the village-level collectives. The shareholding 
cooperative system is a new invented system to adapt peasants to 
market mechanism and to accelerate the development of rural 
economy, and is another major reform in the rural management 
system. This year, the development trend of the shareholding 
cooperative system in the province's rural areas has been very 
good. We must utilize this good trend to spread this system by 
regarding it as a major measure to accelerate the reform and 
development of the rural areas. At present, we should mainly 
spread this system among town and township enterprises. The 
newly initiated town and township enterprises should all adopt, 
in principle, this system. At the same time, we should use this 
system to renovate existing town and township enterprises to 
change the confusion in property right and the lack of funds. 
We should use about two years of time to change more than half 
of village collective enterprises to shareholding cooperative 
enterprises. We should also extend the shareholding cooperative 
system to the spheres of the serial development of the cropping 
industry, the circulation of agricultural and sideline products, 
and the rural collectivized service. All kinds of economic 
organizations, institutions of higher learning, scientific 
research institutes, and peasants should be allowed to buy 
shares with funds, equipment, plant houses, technology, land, 
and labor forces. In spreading the shareholding cooperative 
system, we must give guidances based on respective cases. The 
areas which have not yet introduced the shareholding cooperative 
system should try the system first and then popularize it as 
quickly as possible. The areas which are experimenting with 
this system should primarily reduce the restrictions on policies 
and allow peasants to carry it out freely. The areas which have 
achieved relatively great progress in carrying out the system 
should be guided in a timely manner to deepen towards the 
orientation of standardization and systemization with the 
purpose of gradually making their distribution of shares 
reasonable, their organizational structure perfect, their 
management system perfect, and their profit distribution 
appropriate. 
  B. We should accelerate the establishment of socialized 
service system and gradually realize all-process socialized 
service to production, operation, distribution, and consumption. 
Since the household-based contract system was instituted, 
socialized service networks composed of rural collective 
economic organizations, agriculture-related departments, and 
various intermediate organizations have been improved step by 
step and have made great contributions to rural economic 
development. However, the service functions and service scope 
of these service organizations still fall far short of the 
demand for developing rural productive forces. The service 
entities run by peasants are not well organized, and 
village-level service are universally uncoordinated. The 
quality of service provided by county and township agricultural 
departments has weakened, the service of agriculture-related 
departments is at a low level, and the degree of socialization 
of the entire service system is not high. To solve the 
above-mentioned problems and make independent operations more 
compatible with the unified market, we should regard 
establishment of the socialized service system as an industry to 
develop. Agriculture, science and technology, commerce, grain, 
supply and marketing, finance, and material departments should 
adhere to the purpose of serving agriculture and peasants, 
actively explore the fields of service, strengthen their service 
functions, coordinate their services, and establish a sound 
service network by combining the supplies of funds and means of 
production, the dissemination of technology, and technical 
training before production, the technical and operational 
guidance during production, and the processing, storage, 
transportation, and marketing after production. We should give 
play to the role of rural production and managerial experts, 
encourage and support them to operate or establish service 
organizations or service entities, and gradually turn the 
service organizations run by peasants into specialized 
associations performing the functions of self-service and 
self-protection. We should improve community service 
organizations, provide particular assistance for the townships 
and villages with weak collective economy to establish service 
organizations, and guide them to gradually enhance their service 
strength and improve their service level by starting with 
technical service and expanding their collective economy. We 
should step up efforts to improve county and township 
agriculture stations (centers), update their technology and 
equipment in a planned manner, strive to increase the wages of 
agricultural scientific and technical personnel, provide 
grass-roots agriculture-related units with necessary means of 
service, enable their technical personnel to have ease of mind 
in their service work, and continuously improve their service 
quality. After this, we should establish a provincewide 
socialized service pattern with sound organizations and 
functions. 
  C. We should lift control on and protect the prices of farm 
products and cultivate and establish the market system more 
rapidly in order to provide favorable conditions for developing 
the rural commodity economy. The key to cultivating and 
building rural markets is to let the prices of farm products 
take shape chiefly through the market. To establish a new 
mechanism for the prices of farm products, enliven rural 
circulation, and increase peasants' income, the province, 
beginning next year, will keep the amount of grain to be 
purchased under contract unchanged and purchase all the 
contracted amount of grain at market price. When the market is 
lower than the state-fixed protection price, we will purchase at 
the protection price. We will continue the method of paying 
extra money for peasants to cover the difference between the 
government prices and the market prices of chemical fertilizers 
and diesel oil supplied to peasants according to their 
purchasing contracts and supply them with chemical fertilizers, 
diesel oil, and deposits linked to the contracted purchase in a 
timely manner. We should do a good job in the coordination and 
preparations for the reform of the grain purchasing and 
marketing system, regard it the priority of next year's work to 
improve the grain markets and the marketing contingents, 
establish the grain risk fund system as soon as possible, and 
improve the grain reserve system. The prices of all farm and 
sideline products will be lifted in the future, business 
channels will be liberalized, and all obstacles will be removed 
so as to provide equal opportunities and environment to various 
business organizations and peasants. Establishment of the 
market system is the basis of the market economy. We should 
develop, cultivate, and build markets more rapidly. With 
wholesale markets as the center and rural fairs as the 
supplement, We should establish as soon as possible a framework 
of the market system under which the markets for commodities and 
the markets for essential elements of production are developed 
in a coordinated manner, rural areas are linked with urban 
areas, and markets are rationally distributed, have sound 
organizations and complete functions, exercise standard 
management, and are highly efficient and unimpeded. The 
provincial authorities should give priority to building the 
agricultural product wholesale markets and the futures markets 
to serve the whole country; all cities and towns should give 
priority to building agricultural product special wholesale 
markets with local superiority; and all townships and towns 
should give priority to building country trade fairs. We should 
actively cultivate the markets of essential production factors, 
such as the markets of banking, property right, technology, 
information, and labor forces. In cultivating and building 
markets, we must manage things in line with market law, give 
full consideration to conditions for the flow of commodities and 
personnel and for collection and distribution of commodities, 
extensively conduct activities to invite business, and persist 
in making scientific plans and seeking gradual development. We 
should strengthen the building of infrastructure facilities, 
including telecommunications, road and warehouses, develop 
banking, insurance, notary, commercial, catering, and service 
industries and give priority to improving the conditions of 
special wholesale markets which have attained an initial scale. 
We should improve the laws and regulations for market 
transactions, business activities and market competition, 
establish arbitration organs to settle disputes in transaction 
and in honoring of contracts, set norms to keep the market 
business within proper bounds, and protect fair transactions and 
legal competitions. Meanwhile, we should be determined to 
cultivate and develop a batch of contingents to sell farm 
products and major products of township enterprises, give 
priority to supporting major commodity circulation units, 
develop intermediary organs, continue to give play to the role 
of state and cooperative commercial units as the main 
circulation channels, do a good job in linking production with 
the market, and invigorate commodity circulation in the rural 
areas. 
  D. We should strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation 
and control of the rural economy and promote a sound rural 
economic development. It is impossible for the market mechanism 
to spontaneously strengthen the agricultural foundation status. 
In the process of establishing the socialist market economic 
system, we must strive to strengthen and improve the 
government's macroeconomic regulation and control over 
agriculture. Governments at all levels should stand on the high 
plane of taking overall responsibility, act in line with their 
functions of "guidance, support, protection and macro regulation 
and control," follow the law of value, apply the economic 
levers, and give correct and effective control over rural 
economic performance. We should grasp the trend of agricultural 
development and market changes, make rational plans and readjust 
the distribution of rural productive forces and promote an 
coordinated development in various trades and regions and 
between the economic and social sectors. We should regard such 
major affairs as the readjustment of the proportion of 
industrial and agricultural investments, the agricultural 
investment structure, major agricultural capital construction 
projects, the price parities between industrial and agricultural 
products, the readjustment of rural production set-up, and the 
development of industry to support agriculture that affect the 
overall situation as the priorities of regulation and control 
and adopt more economic and legal means to manage agricultural 
production. We should strengthen rural economic legislation, 
gradually improve regulations and laws on supporting 
agricultural development, protecting agriculture and 
safeguarding the interests of peasants, deeply carry out the 
work on running villages and townships in line with law, and 
raise the degree of standardization of rural economic 
performance and the level of legality. We should strengthen the 
building of rural market information system, develop information 
research and consulting organs of various ownerships in a 
planned manner, do a good job in market forecast for 
agricultural products and information dissemination and induce 
peasants to develop agricultural production in line with market 
changes. Continued efforts should be made to promote 
comprehensive reform pilot work in counties and urge pilot 
counties to further emancipate the minds, expand the reform 
strength, take the lead in establishing market economic 
operational mechanism and set examples in county reform for the 
whole province. 
<H3>  3. Hold Aloft the Banner of Becoming Well-Off, Accelerate 
the Development of County Economy and Strive To Build a 
Prosperous and Civilized New Countryside </H3>
  In a final analysis, the issues of agriculture, the rural 
areas and peasants are the issues of development. Realizing the 
goal of becoming well-off is a common desire and new pursuit of 
the broad masses of peasants after they have enough food and 
clothing as well as the fundamental motivation for accelerating 
the development of agriculture and the rural economy. The core 
of development is to unceasingly increase the income of 
peasants. This is a major change in the idea of rural 
development. Party committees and governments at all levels 
should consider accelerating the development of rural productive 
forces and county economy and unceasingly increasing the income 
of peasants as the fundamental starting and resting points of 
rural work. 
  A. We should vigorously develop high-yield, good-quality, 
high-efficient, and export-oriented agriculture in line with the 
demands of domestic and foreign markets to increase the rural 
economic results. Over the past years, particularly this year, 
under the guidance of markets, all localities have positively 
developed and produced various good-quality farm and sideline 
products that are suitable to the consumption demands and have 
made noticeable achievements in increasing production and 
economic results. Facts fully showed that the development of 
high-yield, good-quality, high-efficient, and export-oriented 
agriculture is an essential demand of the tendency for suiting 
the market demands and the changes of the foodstuff structure, 
ensuring a stable increase in the output of basic farm products, 
and comprehensively improving the agricultural production level 
as well as an accurate choice to optimize the internal 
agricultural structure and increase the rural economic results. 
So, we are required to shift the focus of agricultural 
production from the increase in quantities to the improvement of 
quality and to increase agriculture's economic results through 
readjustment of the agricultural structure. On the basis of 
stabilizing development and optimizing grain production, we 
should vigorously develop readily marketable cash crops and 
forage crops and ceaselessly increase the benefits from grain 
production and the overall utilization rate of natural 
resources. We should persist in the target of building animal 
husbandry into a pillar industry of the rural economy; focus on 
developing the breeding of milk cow, meat cattle, lean hogs, and 
poultry; promote the coordination of agriculture and animal 
husbandry to increase the output value through transformation; 
and strive to make our province become a large grain and 
livestock production province. We should fully use mountain, 
water, forest, grass, and mineral resources and bring into play 
the advantages of suburban areas, the areas along both sides of 
roads, and gardens to develop the cash crops and breeding 
industries that have big markets, to develop new production 
spheres, and to expand new revenue sources. Our province has 
the advantages of opening its border areas to the outside world. 
This is a favorable condition for developing the 
export-oriented agriculture. According to the international 
market demands, we should set up, in a well-planned manner, a 
group of export farm product production and processing bases; 
expand the production of readily marketable products; 
ceaselessly improve the quality and standing of commodities; 
strive to increase the proportion of export farm products; and 
increase the market competitiveness. 
  B. We should persistently pay equal attention to development 
and improvement, vigorously develop town and township 
enterprises, and accelerate the pace of industrializing the 
countryside. Our province has rich natural resources, registers 
a faster increase in the total output of farm products, and has 
favorable conditions for developing town and township 
enterprises. However, the farm product processing and 
utilization rate is rather low. This indicates that the town 
and township enterprises have great potential for development. 
Although our province has speeded up the development of town 
and township enterprises, their results are not high, only a 
small number of town and township enterprises are engaged in 
industrial production, their product standing is low, and their 
market competitiveness is weak. The strains on capital, 
projects, and skilled persons still restrict the development of 
town and township enterprises. We must unswervingly regard the 
development of town and township enterprises as a strategic 
priority of the economic work; persist in the principle of 
paying equal attention to development and improvement; 
vigorously carry out the "leap-over project;" strive to ensure 
that the town and township enterprises realize more than 70 
billion yuan of output value by the end of 1995; and improve, at 
the same pace, output value, results, and enterprise quality. 
To this end, we must persistently coordinate the setup of 
high-tech and export-oriented town and township enterprises with 
large markets with that of town and township enterprises with 
fewer investment and faster economic results so as to support 
the development of town and township enterprises. We should 
strengthen the construction of projects for town and township 
enterprises; cultivate a group of specialized ranks engaged in 
the development of projects; and develop high-tech processing 
projects with high market demands, fewer investment, and faster 
efficiency so as to provide timely service for town and township 
enterprises. All localities should be geared to the needs of 
markets, continue to bring into play the advantages of natural 
resources, and try every possible means to build a group of 
projects with fewer investment and faster economic results. 
Being based on this, the province, prefectures, cities, and 
counties should concentrate necessary funds and technological 
forces to establish and develop a group of large-scale town and 
township enterprises with high starting points and to strengthen 
the lineup of key town and township enterprises. We should 
develop small industrial zones of town and township enterprises 
and increase their economic results. In township enterprise 
investment, we should particularly ensure the construction of 
small industrial zones, and concentrate fairly high starting 
points for new township enterprises there. In small industrial 
zones with favorable conditions, we should establish township 
enterprise groups that have advantages in their scale, in a 
timely manner. We should also greatly increase the proportion 
of town and township industries. We should develop both 
resources, new products, and industries and facilitate the 
scientific and technological advance of township enterprises. 
We should formulate and implement the brand-name strategy for 
developing township enterprises, accelerate the development of 
new products and the improvement of key products, actively bring 
in and disseminate applicable advanced technology, and enable 
township enterprises to develop a series of products. Meanwhile, 
we should establish the personnel markets in service of township 
enterprises, resolve township enterprises' shortage of personnel 
by training some operation experts, bringing in some backbone 
technical personnel, and selecting some managerial personnel, 
and strive to improve the technological quality of township 
enterprises and increase the competitive edges of their 
products. We should raise funds on our own through various 
channels and bring in funds from outside to increase the money 
investment in township enterprises. The 2-billion-yuan 
investment in township enterprises we arranged for next year 
should be in place, the major part of the accumulation of rural 
collective economy should be used in developing township 
enterprises, and townships, villages, enterprises, and peasants 
should be mobilized continuously to raise funds by themselves to 
develop the processing industry. Finance departments at all 
levels should earmark a certain amount of funds to pay the 
interest of the loans for township enterprises. All finance 
organizations should adopt every means possible to lend money to 
township enterprises and, at the same time, take advantage of 
geographical position and blood relation to conscientiously 
implement the "township enterprise demonstration project in 
eastern and western parts," extensively develop joint operation 
and cooperation with developed localities, and bring in more 
funds for townships, villages, and township enterprises. We 
should further improve the operating mechanism of township 
enterprises and enhance township enterprises' ability for market 
competition. We should reform the internal managerial system, 
strengthen the status of township enterprise directors and 
managers as representatives of legal persons, and change the 
situation in which township enterprises are attached to 
governments and there are too many administrative interventions. 
Focusing on increasing the market shares of the products of 
township enterprises, we should also launch in-depth activities 
to improve product quality and increase the marketing rate of 
products and the profit-tax rate of output value, and strengthen 
the production and management of the enterprises. We should 
conscientiously implement the system of responsibility for 
attaining the targets of supporting township enterprises and 
launch extensive activities to link urban and rural areas. 
Departments directly under the province should define and 
implement their supporting measures as soon as possible 
according to the targets and work assigned them. In line with 
the principles of mutual benefit, mutual supplementation with 
each other's advantages, and common development, universities, 
large research institutes, and large plants should focus their 
coordination and cooperation activities on arming small 
industrial zones so as to support the sustained and rapid 
development of township enterprises. 
  C. We should implement regional distribution and specialized 
production, establish the production and operation systems 
whereby trade, industry, and agriculture are integrated and 
production, processing, marketing a coordinated process, and 
improve the industrialization of the rural economy. Selecting 
and establishing the leading industries and highly competitive 
products with regional comparable advantage is the premise of 
participation in domestic and foreign market competition; and 
organizing specialized and large-scale production according to 
the demand for socialized production is the basis to win the 
regional comparable advantage. Geared to the domestic and world 
markets, we should adopt every means to develop, cultivate, and 
expand our advantageous industries and products, improve the 
level of rural industries, and extend the industrial chains. 
Judging from the situation of the province, we should exert 
great efforts to develop the intensive processing of such staple 
grain crops as corns and soybeans, such major economic crops as 
flax and beets, such animal by-products as milk, meat, and 
feathers, and such natural resources as forests and mineral 
reserves. In this way, we can develop a series of finely 
processed foods, feed, flax cloth, dairy products, sugar, 
tobacco, leather, furniture, soft drinks, medicines, and 
building materials to increase the value of farm products. In 
line with their advantages in natural resources, products, and 
technology, all cities, prefectures, and counties should work 
out good plans for developing their local economy so that 
respective guiding industries and superior products dominate, 
should organize and guide peasants to do business centering on 
guiding industries and key products, should advocate the 
practice of "one village engaging in one product and one 
township engaging in one trade," and should develop specialized 
production and scale management. To increase industrialization 
of the rural economy, we must focus on establishing a production 
and management system characterized by a close combination of 
cropping, breeding, and processing of production, supply, and 
marketing, of internal and foreign trade, and of agriculture, 
industry, and commerce. We should also accelerate the 
development of organizations that integrate industry and 
agriculture with foreign trade. Working to form a framework in 
three years and perfecting mechanism in five years, the province 
should emphatically grasp the work concerning the organizations 
which produce, process, and market product series with grain, 
flex, dairy products, and beets as their raw materials. 
Meanwhile, all cities and prefectures should emphatically 
cultivate trade-industry-agriculture integrations embracing 
local industrial and product advantages. All counties and 
townships should give full play to the role of corporations, 
associations, and able persons to help improve the management 
efficiency of existing integrated organizations. In building 
and developing trade-industry-agriculture organizations, we must 
break with the limits of administrative division and integrate 
raw materials production belts and processing bases with 
commodity distributing centers in order to commonly develop 
production-processing-marketing integrations. Meanwhile, we 
must emphatically cultivate and strengthen leading enterprises; 
accelerate the development of new products and markets, 
technological transformation, and the change in the operating 
mechanism of these enterprises; and enable these enterprises to 
play an even greater role in bringing along a number of 
specialized villages and specialized households and in running a 
number of production bases. In addition, we must pay attention 
to the profit linking of trade-industry-agriculture integrations 
and develop the economic groups that share risks and profits and 
that are closely connected, in line with the principle of 
improving efficiency. State farms are an important component 
part of the rural economy and are provided with relatively good 
conditions for developing rural industries and large-scale 
production. We should continue to deepen the restructuring of 
state farms and reinforce the position of production and 
management organizations as the mainstay of markets. We should 
exploit overall advantages to appropriately promote large-scale 
management around the development of guiding industrial series. 
Centering on improving economic efficiency, we should develop 
diversified management and fine and deep processing, initiate 
secondary and tertiary industries, make great efforts to 
increase accumulation, and continuously improve the living 
standards of staff and workers. We should also continue to 
organize the "state farm-county joint building" activities and 
exploit the demonstration role of state farms. 
  D. We should further integrate agriculture with science and 
education and make great efforts to increase the technology 
content of agricultural products and to improve the scientific, 
technological, and cultural quality of peasants. A decisive 
factor for the sustained increase in total output of the 
province's agricultural products, for the constant improvement 
in the quality of agricultural products, and for the rapid 
development of the province's rural economy lies in the 
successful implementation of the strategy of invigorating 
agriculture with science and education for many years running. 
Next year, we must implement in an even better manner the 
measure of invigorating agriculture through science and 
education and must further orient the development of rural areas 
to the orbit of depending on scientific and technological 
progress and improving the quality of laborers. 
  With the improvement in the quality of agricultural products 
and in economic efficiency of agriculture as the center, and 
with the development of fine products and the popularization of 
practical technology as the emphasis, we should seize the 
opportunity provided by the readjustment of the agricultural 
product mix and rural economic structure to further enhance the 
level of integrating agriculture with science and education, 
expand from the integrations within our own regions to the 
integrations with other regions, and expand integration in the 
agricultural sphere to the non-agricultural sphere. We should 
expand the integrations from single-item technologies to 
comprehensive technologies. We should further expand the scale 
of agriculture-science-education integrations. The integrations 
should be made universal gradually in the province's rural areas 
while paying attention to the work of some counties and 
townships where the integrations are being experimented with. 
We should further improve the quality of 
agriculture-science-education integration. Agricultural 
departments should continue to organize the implementation of 
the "bumper harvest plan," expand the coverage of areas applying 
advanced practical technologies, and define in a timely manner, 
the joint-research projects that may promote the progress of 
agriculture. In line with the demands of agricultural 
development, scientific research departments should organize 
forces to strengthen the selection and cultivation of new breeds 
of animals and plants of good quality, high output, and high 
resistance to diseases. We should strengthen research in 
stay-fresh, storage, package, and transport techniques for 
agricultural products and foodstuffs; strengthen implementation 
of the "spark" plan; vigorously develop brand-name, 
fine-quality, special, and new products; and successfully run 
new agricultural high-tech park zones and practical technology 
demonstration zones. Educational departments should increase 
the number of labor and technology courses among rural middle 
schools in line with the process of popularizing advanced 
agricultural techniques, conduct adult education with a focus on 
improving the technological expertise of peasants, and train all 
kinds of specialized talents for developing the rural economy. 
  E. Efforts should be made to increase inputs in agriculture, 
to enhance the construction of agricultural infrastructures, and 
to reinforce the reserve strength of agricultural development. 
We should be determined to readjust the distributing pattern of 
national income and truly to enforce special policies for 
agriculture. The increased scale of financial spending budget 
for agriculture in 1994 should surpass that of the total 
financial spending budget by over two percentage points. Funds 
raised by localities for supporting agriculture should show a 10 
percent increase each year and loans released for agriculture 
should show a 20 percent increase. Various loans and funds for 
supporting agriculture must be assuredly released in a timely 
manner and in line with the fixed volume. In order to meet the 
reform in the investment systems, it is imperative to expand the 
investment channels for agriculture while doing a good job in 
conducting reform among the rural financial organs; and to 
encourage peasants and rural collectively-owned enterprises to 
increase their accumulations through labor work and their funds 
for investments. It is also imperative to encourage peasants 
and these collectively-owned enterprises to broaden their fund 
resources by increasing the charges of non-agricultural land and 
to enliven their rural funds by successfully operating rural 
credit cooperatives and establishing cooperative foundations. 
Efforts should be made to enhance the management over 
agricultural funds, to upgrade the efficiency of fund 
utilization, and to prevent fund outflow and illegal diversion. 
By upholding the farmland capital construction with the focal 
points of improving soil, taming rivers, and planting trees, we 
should concentrate our efforts on building a large number of 
large and backbone projects of preventing flood; draining 
flooded fields; conducting irrigation; generating power; storing 
water; and diverting river water while accomplishing the repair, 
rebuilding, and improvement of the existing water conservancy 
facilities. Efforts should be made to accelerate the pace in 
consolidating the serious soil erosion in some areas; to regard 
as a focal point the tree planting aimed at greening the waste 
mountains; to accelerate the pace of fostering forests alongside 
water areas, used as a shelter for agricultural production, and 
aimed at maintaining the water resources; and to pay attention 
to developing the follow-up resources of forestry. A good job 
should be continuously done in carrying out comprehensively 
agricultural development on the Sanjiang and Songnen plains, 
accelerating the improvement of medium-and-low-yield farmland 
and of grassland, continuously fostering soil fertility, 
protecting farmland, and improving the agricultural ecological 
environment. When formulating their economic and social 
development plans, various localities should give preferential 
consideration to the construction of rural infrastructures and 
do a good job in carrying out an overall design. They should 
also integrate the improvement of agricultural productive 
conditions with the agricultural development, the project 
construction with the ecological construction, farm machines and 
agricultural technologies with land utilization and maintenance, 
and the improvement of peasants' living conditions and the 
ecological environment with the construction of new rural 
villages so as to improve the province's construction of rural 
infrastructures to a new level. 
  F. Efforts should be made to accelerate the construction of 
small towns, to further enforce the integration between urban 
and rural areas, and to promote the harmonious development 
between the urban and rural economy. Small towns are major 
carriers of secondary and tertiary industries and represent a 
fundamental way to realize the urbanization of rural areas. 
Party committees and governments at all levels should regard 
the construction of small towns as a strategic measure of 
developing the rural economy and the county economy and put the 
construction on their major work schedule. They should strive 
to enable the province's construction of small towns to achieve 
greater development by the end of this century and foster or 
establish a large number of star towns that possess their own 
characteristics, have obvious strong points, are exerting large 
influence, and are stronger in playing a role of bringing along 
others. Efforts should be made to further improve the plan for 
small town construction, to make rational arrangements, to make 
breakthroughs in key areas, to enforce the plan step by step, to 
give priority to building up the county seats in the recent 
period, and to emphatically develop organic towns along border 
areas as well as railways and highways. We should uphold the 
principle of developing industries to build up towns and to make 
them prosperous and integrate the construction of small towns 
with the development of processing and tertiary industries. We 
should also enforce preferential policies in this regard and 
direct the rural cooperative economic organizations to open an 
enterprise in urban areas and the secondary and tertiary 
industrial enterprises in rural areas to jointly move in small 
towns. Efforts should be made to encourage peasants to join in 
industrial work in urban areas, to open a business such as food 
services, and to engage in the undertakings of transportation 
and construction so as to reinforce the cohesion and influence 
of small towns. In order to promote the construction of small 
towns and the development of secondary and tertiary industries, 
county seats may adequately broaden their scale as long as they 
have achieved faster development in the economy and basically 
possessed the conditions in various fields. We should 
emancipate our minds and actively conduct the pilot work of 
reform among the systems of urban resident registers. Peasants 
who are running industrial plants or business firms in urban 
areas as well as who have bought a house there, had a relatively 
stable job, and paid a certain volume of urban construction 
fees, may be allowed to become urban residents and their family 
registers may be put into ordinary management. 
  G. We should step up efforts to promote the reform of 
county-run industrial enterprises by turning them into ones 
owned by the state but managed by the people or ones owned and 
managed by the people and greatly develop individual and private 
economies to cultivate and expand the county-level financial 
resources. The reform of the financial and tax systems to be 
promoted by the state next year will create some new conditions 
in the county-level finance. An important link to conform to 
the new conditions is to cultivate and open up new financial 
resources. County-run state-owned industrial enterprises 
constitute an important factor affecting county-level finance. 
To make county-run industrial enterprises successful, the 
provincial party committee, in August this year, held a forum on 
the reform of state-owned small industrial enterprises, deciding 
to combine the property right reform of the county-run 
industrial enterprises with their technical transformation to 
remold their systems and organizations. However, the work has 
proceeded in an uneven manner. Effective measures should be 
adopted to promote it more greatly. Judging from long-term 
development, domestic and foreign funds and technology should be 
used to renovate the enterprises who possess advantages in their 
products and whose economic efficiency is fairly good. The 
cooperative shareholding system should be applied to those whose 
products are still marketable but have no good prospects, and 
they should be leased or sold out to have their property right 
transferred and organization innovated. Those whose assets 
cannot cover their debts and who hold no promise of ending their 
deficits should close, suspend their production, and even go 
bankrupt so as to cast away their burdens. All cities and 
prefectures should attach great importance to this work and 
devote some time to giving specific guidance to promote this 
work in the counties and cities under their jurisdiction. All 
counties and cities should step up classification of their 
industrial enterprises and define realistic reform methods and 
adopt feasible measures to accelerate their reform. We should 
strive to complete the transformation of the systems and 
mechanisms in more than one-third of the county-run industrial 
enterprises in the province within next year. Practice in the 
county-level economic development showed that individual and 
private economies should be developed bravely because they are 
the new growing points of the rural economy and another 
important source of county-level revenues. We should further 
liberalize the scope of their business and allow individual 
household industrial production or business and owners of 
private enterprises to engage in all the production and business 
other than those prohibited by the state in explicit orders. We 
should further liberalize the methods of business and allow 
individual and private enterprises to contract, lease, merge, 
and purchase state-owned and collective small enterprises. 
  H. We should attend to the two civilizations simultaneously 
and be competent in both so as to promote their coordinated 
development. While promoting the rural material civilization, we 
should conscientiously strengthen the spiritual civilization to 
make rural areas develop along the direction of affluence and 
civility. We should strengthen rural ideological and political 
work, intensify the education on the theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, and continue the 
education on patriotism, collectivism, and socialism to guide 
the vast number of peasants to foster a spiritual pillar of the 
new era. We should launch extensive activities to build 
civilized villages and civilized households and guide peasants 
to establish a good practice characterized by plain living and 
hard work, thrift in running homes, respect for the old and love 
for the young, support for the poor, and help to those with 
difficulties. When summarizing the work to achieve a fairly 
comfortable standard of living in this winter and next spring 
and when implementing the "agriculture law," we should emphasize 
the education on the market economy and legal system and guide 
peasants to enhance the sense as the mainstay, the sense of 
competition, and the sense of self-protection. We should 
actively develop rural education and further improve the 
conditions for running schools. We should increase the number 
of students enrolled in and following through the nine-year 
compulsory education, reduce illiteracy, and prevent new 
illiteracy. Colleges and secondary specialized schools should 
enroll more students from rural areas and increase the students 
trained for certain organizations and those to be assigned to 
certain organizations. We should do a good job in improving 
rural cultural facilities and the contingent of literary and art 
workers to enrich the rural cultural life. We should succeed in 
the rural medical reform focusing on improving rural cooperative 
medical service, develop rural public health, and 
conscientiously resolve peasants' difficulties in receiving 
medical service. We should strictly enforce the family planning 
policies, coordinate the family planning work with the 
development of the rural economy and the improvement of the 
social guaranteeing system dominated by the old-age pension 
system, and control the natural rural population growth rate. 
We should further strengthen the overall management of social 
order; carry out the leadership responsibility system and the 
system that the activities of making assessment through 
comparison and awarding the advanced must not be held when the 
family planning targets are not attained; mobilize the masses to 
improve social order; deal strict blows to the gangs of 
hooligans and thefts and the criminals who engage themselves in 
train marauding and waylaying that run amuck at home villages 
and towns; strengthen the management of social order among the 
rural markets, entertainment centers, railway stations, and 
wharves; and create a stable social environment for developing 
the rural economy. 
<H3>  4. Strengthen and Improve the Party's Leadership Over the 
Rural Work and Ensure the Smooth Progress of the Rural Reform 
And Construction </H3>
  The key to strengthening agriculture's role as the 
foundation 
of the national economy and accelerating the pace of rural 
reform and development is to strengthen and improve the party's 
leadership. Particularly, in the course of setting up the 
socialist market economic system, the party committees and 
governments at various levels must pay attention to the issues 
relating to agriculture, the rural areas, and the peasants; 
realistically control the overall rural work situation; and gain 
the initiative in rural reform and development. 
  First, the party committees at various levels should 
strengthen organizational leadership over agriculture and rural 
work and upgrade the ability in controlling the overall rural 
market economic situation. The fundamental way for 
strengthening and improving the party's leadership over the 
rural work is to deeply understand and accurately apply Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and deeply understand and accurately implement 
the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party 
Central Committee and the central rural work conference. 
According to the arrangements of the provincial party 
committee, the party committees at various levels should regard 
the study of the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping" and the documents of the two sessions of the central 
authorities as a prominent political task and a prerequisite for 
improving the leadership level, and conscientiously and 
carefully organize party members and cadres to engage in the 
study. We should coordinate the ideological reality and the 
rural work reality with the rural reform and development tasks; 
grasp the quintessence of emancipating the mind and seeking 
truth from facts; grasp the main line that development is an 
established principle; and solve the problems that the people 
are not inspired with enthusiasm, fail to widen the way of 
thinking, stick to old conventions, and are satisfied at small 
wealth; enhance the firmness of implementing the basic line of 
the party; and upgrade the awareness of grasping agriculture and 
the rural work. The enhancement of the party's leadership over 
agriculture and the rural work should be reflected by the strong 
rural leadership system. The prefectural and county party 
committees should focus their work on agriculture and the rural 
work and assign principal leaders to take charge of the rural 
reform and development tasks. As far as the central cities that 
take charge of guiding the work of counties are concerned, their 
party committees should strengthen the leadership over 
agriculture and the rural work and study ways for solving the 
problems relating to agriculture, rural areas, and the peasants 
in a timely manner. The party committees at or above the county 
level should further assign deputy secretaries in charge of 
agricultural work and also assign vice mayors and deputy county 
heads in charge of industrial work. We should continue to carry 
out the system where counties and townships elect and assign 
deputy heads to take charge of town and township enterprises and 
the scientific and technological work. The agricultural 
committees are the overall departments in charge of agriculture 
and the rural work under the party committees and the 
governments at the same levels, and should bring their functions 
for coordination, management, service, and guidance into full 
play. The improvement of the party's leadership over the rural 
work should be reflected by the formation of the leadership form 
that is suitable to the requirements of the market economy. We 
should treat agriculture and rural work from the angle of the 
market economy, organize rural reform and agricultural 
production with the guidance of the market economy, always 
attach importance to developing the role of the market in 
allocating resources, lose no time in adjusting the rural 
production structure and product mix according to market 
changes, and organize and guide peasants to develop commodity 
production in broader fields. We should persist in the methods 
of using typical examples as guides, giving different guidance 
according to different conditions, and promote work regionwide. 
Following the 10 strong counties and 100 strong towns and 
townships, we should cultivate and foster a number of 
comparatively well-off counties, townships, and villages to 
serve as examples for rural areas to achieve a fairly 
comfortable standard of living more rapidly. We should further 
strengthen work guidance to mountainous and semi-mountainous 
areas, plain areas, border areas, and suburban counties and lead 
all types of counties to carry forward their local advantages 
and develop the county economy with their own characteristics. 
We should continue to support prosperous counties to accelerate 
development, help impoverished counties shake off poverty and 
achieve affluence, implement the preferential policies provided 
by the provincial party committee and government, strengthen the 
supporting, helping, and promoting work, and carry out the 
measures for rewarding attainment of targets to lead these 
counties to accelerate development. 
  Second, we should improve rural grass-roots organizations 
and 
exert great efforts to train groups of persons capable of 
leading rural areas to prosperity. Rural grass-roots 
organizations are the organizational foundation for the party to 
exercise effective leadership over rural work. Aiming at 
developing rural productive forces and increasing peasants' 
income, we should put more efforts into improvement of 
village-level organizations with village party branches as the 
core while improving party committee leading bodies at all 
levels. In line with the principle of emphasizing political 
integrity and abilities, we should adjust, replenish, and 
improve party branch leading bodies in a timely manner and 
attach importance to optimizing their overall structure. Good 
party branch secretaries should be selected from local 
outstanding party members, from the cadres transferred from 
counties or townships, or from town and township reserve cadres. 
We should rectify incompetent party branches with slackened 
morale a group at a time and strictly carry out the regular 
activities of the party organization to improve their combat 
effectiveness and unity. We should regard the training of 
groups of persons capable of leading rural areas to prosperity 
as a long-term and strategic task of improving rural grass-roots 
organizations and conscientiously carry it out. All cities, 
prefectures, and counties should draw up work plans for this 
task and exert more efforts to implement it. We should promote 
town and township major responsible persons by attaching 
importance to their performance; optimize the structure of rural 
grass-roots cadres by selecting the people with higher political 
quality; expand the contingents of town and township 
entrepreneurs by training them and developing the rational 
mobility of trained personnel; and give play to the 
demonstration role of large specialized households through 
policy support. In three to four years, we should strive to 
turn most township and village party and government responsible 
persons into experts in organizing and leading the rural market 
economy and most responsible persons of township enterprises 
into modern entrepreneurs meeting the need of the market 
economy. Every village should have several large specialized 
households and demonstration households who can play a larger 
promoting role. While improving party branches, we should also 
improve villagers' committees, militia organizations, women's 
federations, and the Communist Youth League and develop their 
due role. As rural grass-roots cadres shoulder heavy and 
difficult work and are often the focus of contradictions, party 
committee and governments should make great efforts to 
understand, respect, show concern for, cherish, support, and 
protect them while conducting regular education and management 
to help them improve work styles and maintain close ties with 
peasants. Party and government departments at all levels should 
further enhance the sense of service, regard it as an important 
principle to serve, improve, and invigorate grass-roots 
organizations, make sure that grass-roots cadres direct 
production and perform work in an independent and responsible 
manner, reduce the work burdens on grass-roots cadres, and help 
them solve the specific problems in their work and life so that 
they can have ease of mind in and dedicate themselves to 
organizing and leading peasants to work diligently and achieve 
affluence. 
  Third, we should ensure the implementation of the party's 
policies toward the rural areas and fully mobilize the peasants' 
enthusiasm for production. All prefectures, cities, counties, 
and departments concerned should resolutely, conscientiously, 
and solidly implement the numerous party Central Committee and 
the State Council's current policy measures for agricultural and 
rural economic development; and strive to make noticeable 
achievements within a short period of time. We should 
positively work out serviceable measures for promoting the 
implementation of policies, proceed from reality, and creatively 
implement the decisions of the central authorities and the 
instructions of higher levels. At the time of strengthening the 
mechanism for restricting the implementation of policies, we 
should strengthen organizational restrictions and strictly 
follow the working procedure of working out policies, organizing 
forces to implement policies, and giving examinations and 
instructions so as to institutionalize the implementation of 
policies. We should also strengthen the supervision by the 
masses; have the broad masses of the people understand, be 
familiar with, and grasp policies and gradually handle affairs 
according to policies; fulfill our duties according to laws; and 
resist the activities in violation of policies. Particularly, 
we should implement the policies on supporting the poverty-hit 
counties, coordinate the work of having the poverty-stricken 
areas free themselves from poverty and subsidies with the 
realization of the target of being fairly well-off, increase the 
input to the support of the poor, promote the support-the-poor 
work on a large scale, and promote even economic development 
among various regions. 
  Fourth, we should mobilize the forces of all fronts to 
support agriculture and rural work and unite with one another to 
develop agriculture and make the peasants rich. Organizing and 
mobilizing all social forces to pay attention to, support, and 
develop agriculture should be regarded as a key link of 
strengthening and improving the party's leadership over rural 
work. The departments under the party committees and the 
governments should strengthen the investigations and study on 
agriculture and the rural work; achieve information feedback, 
supervision, and examination; be advisers on guiding 
agricultural production and the rural work to the party 
committees and governments; organize personnel affairs 
departments to prominently grasp the construction of the 
county-level leading bodies, the rural grass-roots 
organizations, and the cadres contingents and the exchange of 
skilled persons; and cultivate increasingly more persons to help 
the rural areas seek wealth. The propaganda and cultural 
departments should strengthen the propaganda on agriculture, the 
rural areas, and the peasants, arouse public opinion on 
protecting and supporting agriculture, and also make efforts to 
enrich the cultural life of the rural areas. The law and 
discipline enforcement organs should strictly investigate and 
handle the cases of harming, cheating, and apportioning expenses 
from the peasants; and protect the legal rights and benefits of 
the rural economic organizations and the peasants. The overall 
economic departments should organize large and medium-sized 
enterprises to positively introduce technologies, products, and 
skilled persons to the rural areas and to conduct cooperation 
with town and township enterprises. According to the state 
industrial policies, the economic lever departments should 
positively support the localities to develop the industries with 
their advantages and develop the private and individual sectors 
of the economy. The internal and external trade departments 
should calculate and report market information, organize the 
circulation of the rural areas, and help counties and cities 
build export commodity production and processing bases in a 
timely manner according to the changes of the domestic and 
foreign markets. Financial organizations should promote the 
flow of capital in the rural areas, grant more loans to 
agriculture, and help the rural areas optimize the industrial 
structure according to the principle of efficiency and in line 
with the credit policies. The Communist Youth League 
organizations, the militia organizations, and the women's 
federations should deeply launch various activities of promoting 
rural reform and development and bring into play the broad 
masses of rural young people, militiamen, and women's role as 
shock brigades, main forces, and half the sky. Only when the 
party and government leaders at various levels pay attention to 
agriculture and the whole society supports agriculture, will a 
brand-new situation in rural economic and social development 
emerge and the peasants' degree of wealth be greatly upgraded.

<F P=106> [By ZHONGGUO JIAOYU BAO (CHINESE EDUCATION JOURNAL) reporter </F>
Liang Jie (2733 2638) and XINHUA reporter Zhang Yinshu (1728 
6892 2562)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 25 Jan (XINHUA) -- Four special groups 
charged with inspecting the enforcement of the "Teachers' Law" 
will leave for Anhui, Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei respectively on 
27 and 29 January. Li Lanqing, member of the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau and vice premier of the State 
Council, told all members of the inspection groups at the Great 
Hall of the People today that paying back what is owed to the 
teachers is not an expedient measure and that there must be no 
further default in teachers pay after paying back what is owed 
them. 
  Li Lanqing said: The "Teachers law" adopted at the fourth 
session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] Standing 
Committee is an important law in promoting China's education 
cause. The law must not be ignored; it must be strictly 
enforced. All localities and departments across the country 
must resolutely implement the law and use it as a weapon to 
resolve practical problems encountered by teachers and to 
further develop a fine social ethics of respecting teachers and 
education. 
  Li Lanqing said: Elementary education is the most important 
layer in China's macroeducation structure. It is something of 
vital importance to the people's standards and the nation's 
future. Therefore, we must do everything possible to make our 
elementary education a success. It is the important 
responsibility of governments at all levels to make elementary 
education, including the nine-year compulsory education, 
successful. Thanks to the efforts of governments at all levels, 
the question of default in teachers' pay, which had existed in 
some areas since the second half of 1992, has been mostly 
resolved. To our knowledge, the problem, however, still existed 
in a few areas. Resolving the question of default in teachers' 
pay is a concrete expression of respect for teachers and 
education. Governments at all levels and people of all walks of 
life should all take it seriously. Paying back what is owed to 
teachers is not an expedient measure; there must be no further 
default in teachers' pay after paying back what is owed them. 
An appropriate safeguard mechanism must be established. 
  Zhao Dongwan, chairman of the NPC Education, Science, 
Culture, and Public Health Committee, and Zhu Kaixuan, minister 
in charge of State Education Commission, were present at the 
meeting. Zhao Dongwan said that the emphasis of the current 
inspection is to find out about: 1) measures adopted by various 
localities in implementing the teachers' law; 2) progress made 
in various localities in paying back teachers' wages; 3) 
progress made in various localities in implementing the newly 
announced wage system; and 4) ways to improve the mechanism for 
ensuring payment of teachers' wages. The four provinces which 
the inspection groups will visit are places where the question 
of default in teachers' pay is more serious. 
  The NPC Education, Science, Culture, and Public Health 
Committee took the lead in organizing the current inspection. 
Responsible persons of departments concerned of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee 
and the State Education Commission were also present.

<F P=106> [Report: "Li Peng Is Making an Inspection Tour in </F>
Guangdong, and Is Expected To Attend the Inauguration Ceremony 
of Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station Next Monday"] 
  [Text] According to informed sources, Chinese Premier Li 
Peng came to Guangdong last week and has been inspecting a 
number of cities in the past few days. He is expected to attend 
the inauguration ceremony of Guangdong's Daya Bay Nuclear Power 
Station, to be held in Shenzhen's Daya Bay on 7 February. 
  Sources disclosed that Premier Li Peng has inspected 
Guangzhou, Foshan, and Zhongshan so far. He went round the 
cities in the evening to admire the light decorations and find 
out about the market and the urban public's daily life as the 
Spring Festival approaches. 
  It is learned that Guangdong's Daya Bay Nuclear Power 
Station, which is about to go into operation, is up to now 
China's biggest Chinese-foreign joint-venture project, with a 
total investment of about $4 billion. While Zhejiang's Qinshan 
Nuclear Power Station, completed in 1991, was China's first 
nuclear power generation base, the soon-to-be-completed Daya Bay 
Nuclear Power Station, with two 900,000-kwt pressurized-water 
reactor generating units, will bring China's nuclear power 
industry to a new height. 
  Sources pointed out: Premier Li Peng has devoted a great 
deal of energy to the construction of Daya Bay Nuclear Power 
Station. From the time when the site was being sought to this 
day when the plant is about to go into operation he has 
inspected the project a total of 10 times and gave clear 
guidelines for every stage of the construction process. He went 
on many observation trips to other countries and painstakingly 
worked out strategies for initiating the nuclear power industry 
in China. He clearly instructed: "Guangdong Nuclear Power 
Station should consistently implement the principle of safety 
first, quality first." The core project of Daya Bay Nuclear 
Power Station started on 7 August 1987, that is, over six years 
ago. Its annual electricity production will be about 10 billion 
kwt-hours, which means, when it is combined with the 
energy-conserving hydroelectric power plants in the province, a 
total annual energy output of 12.6 billion kwt-hours. This will 
greatly benefit the economy in Guangdong and Hong Kong.

<F P=106> [Hong Hu, Liu Zhifeng, and Wang Shiyuan, vice ministers of </F>
the State Commission for Restructuring Economy, interviewed by 
GUANGMING RIBAO reporter Wu Yali (0702 7161 7787), and XINHUA, 
LIEN HO PAO of Taiwan, RENMIN RIBAO, and other Chinese and 
foreign reporters, in the State Council Information Office on 19 
January 1994: "Officials of the State Commission for 
Restructuring Economy Answer Reporters' Questions on Hot topics 
of Economic Reform"--first paragraph is GUANGMING RIBAO 
introduction] 
  [Text] Beijing, 19 Jan (GUANGMING RIBAO)--At a press 
conference for Chinese and foreign reporters held in the State 
Council Information Office this morning, Hong Hu, Liu Zhifeng, 
and Wang Shiyuan, vice ministers of the State Commission for 
Restructuring Economy, answered questions on hot topics about 
which people are universally concerned at present. 
  [XINHUA] Many measures will be taken this year. What are 
the key ones? 
  [Hong Hu] There are two key points in reform this year. One 
is to deepen the reform of the enterprise structure and to carry 
out experiments on the establishment of a modern enterprise 
system. The other is to promote the reform of the 
macroregulation and macrocontrol structure and, at the same 
time, to carry out as a supplement the building of the market 
system with the essentials market as the dominant factor and to 
speed up the progress in the reforms of the social security and 
housing systems. 
  [Du Yali] In October 1993, GUANGMING RIBAO published a 
report which stated that losses of state assets were serious, 
totaling 100 million yuan a day. This attracted the attention 
of the readers. Please tell us whether or not the rate of such 
losses has been curbed. Is the situation improving? 
  [Hong] This issue has attracted great attention in the State 
Council and measures are being taken. In the course of carrying 
out modern enterprise system reform and of reorganizing property 
rights this year, how to avoid the loss of state assets is an 
issue especially worthy of our attention. 
  Hong Hu disclosed after analyzing several causes of the 
losses of state assets at present: The work of formulating the 
"Regulations on Supervision and Control Over State Assets" has 
been completed. At present, some technical problems are being 
handled and the regulations will soon be promulgated. The 
regulations explicitly state the responsibility of government 
investment organs in supervising and controlling state assets. 
The promulgation of the regulations will effectively curb the 
rate of losses of state assets. 
  [LIEN HO PAO] The reorganization of property rights will 
inevitably result in unemployment for some people. Is the 
living standards of these people secured? 
  [Hong] Both the reorganization of property rights and the 
readjustment of the enterprise organization structure involve 
the issue of arrangements for the placement of staff members and 
workers. The state has always attached great importance to 
this. In May last year, the State Council issued documents 
clearly stating the arrangements for staff members and workers 
of state enterprises who are awaiting jobs and departments 
concerned have, in accordance with the number of people and a 
certain percentage, established insurance funds for those 
awaiting jobs. According to relevant documents issued by the 
state, the living standards of the staff members and workers in 
bankrupt enterprises are secured. 
  Liu Zhifeng said, in reply to a question on housing reform 
raised by RENMIN RIBAO: On 31 December 1993, the State Council 
issued a circular on resolutely stopping sales of houses at low 
prices. Some people mistakenly thought that housing reform 
would stop. As a matter of fact, stopping the sales of houses 
at low prices is precisely to better promote housing reform. 
This is because the sales of houses at low prices will easily 
lead to unfair distribution once again, which is harmful to 
long-term housing reform. The State Council will soon 
promulgate a decision on speeding up the residential housing 
system reform in towns and cities. Selling houses will be the 
dominant factor and selling, renting, and building houses will 
be carried out at the same time. Various departments should 
energetically and safely promote the sales of houses strictly in 
accordance with the method for fixing prices stipulated by the 
State Council.

  [Text] Fuzhou, January 28 (XINHUA) -- The rich resources 
of agriculture in the area of Fuzhou city, capital of east 
China's Fujian Province, has attracted more and more overseas 
investors. 
  Last year Fuzhou city approved more than 450 overseas-funded 
agricultural projects with a total investment of 1.27 billion 
U.S. dollars. The direct overseas funds which went into the 
projects amounted to about 1 billion U.S. dollars. 
  The overseas-funded agricultural projects involve 
cultivation 
of flowers, breeding of domestic fowls, processing of forest 
products and ocean-going fishing. 
  In the suburbs of Fuzhou city, the Agricultural Scientific 
Development Park, first of its kind in Fujian Province, absorbed 
about 150 million U.S. dollars within a year. 
  In the past two years, Fuzhou municipal government has 
organized agricultural experts and technicians to survey the 
projects in the areas of Fuzhou and it is planning to cooperate 
with overseas counterparts on more than 600 projects. 
  There are now more than 800 overseas businessmen who are 
engaged in comprehensive agricultural development projects.

  [Text] Washington, February 2 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. Senate 
today approved an authorization bill of 12.4 billion dollars for 
fiscal years 1994 and 1995 for the State Department, the U.S. 
Information Agency and the Peace Corps. 
  Attached to the bill, which was passed 92-8, were amendments 
calling for the unilateral lifting of arms embargo against 
Bosnia- Herzegovina and recommending the redeployment of 
tactical nuclear weapons in South Korea if no major progress was 
made in talks with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on 
nuclear inspections. 
  Another amendment, passed last week, urges the Bill Clinton 
administration to end a 19-year-old trade embargo on Vietnam. 
  The amendments are not legally binding. 
  Clinton said today he might make a decision on the embargo 
in 
a few days. 
  According to the Senate bill, which still has to be 
reconciled with the House of Representatives, 900 million 
dollars will be provided for peacekeeping missions over the 
two-year period aside from an 175 million dollars requested for 
an international peacekeeping contingency fund. 
  The Senate bill also called for: 
  -- The quick inclusion of East European countries in the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization as full members while 
praising the "Partnership for Peace" Program. 
  -- Cuts of 10 percent and 20 percent respectively for 1994 
and 1995 for U.S. contributions to the United Nations. 
  -- Blocking arms sales to countries that enforce the Arab 
League boycott on U.S. companies that do business with Israel.

  [Text] Washington, February 2 (XINHUA) -- William Perry, 
President Bill Clinton's nominee for secretary of defense, said 
today the U.S. would try to "lock-in democratic reforms already 
achieved" in Russia. 
  "No national security issue is more important to us and to 
our children than a stable government in Russia dedicated to 
democracy," said Perry, who appeared at a confirmation hearing 
in the Senate. 
  Now deputy to outgoing Pentagon chief Les Aspin, Perry said 
the Pentagon would strengthen military cooperation with the 
Russians and to "encourage the Russian military to be a force 
for reform, not an opponent of reform." 
  Warning that "the road to democracy and stability in Russia 
is going to be rocky and twisted," Perry said the U.S. "must be 
patient and not be deterred by temporary setbacks" in Russia. 
  Perry, 66, had been a professor in the School of Engineering 
at Stanford University and co-director of Stanford's Center for 
International Security and Arms Control before taking the 
current post. 
  In the face of a smaller defense budget, Perry pledged to 
"institute innovative management techniques to vigorously foster 
acquisition reform and to preserve a necessary industrial base." 
  According to Senate Armed Services Committee chairman Sam 
Nunn, there is a 13-billion-dollar gap between the Clinton 
1994-1998 spending plan and what is called for under the 
recently-concluded military "bottom-up review." 
  In addition, if inflation factors were taken into account, 
the Pentagon may face another 30 billion dollars shortage in the 
five-year period. 
  Besides budgetary problems, Perry also has to cope with such 
headaches as homosexuals in the military and women serving in 
combat missions.

  [Text] Washington, February 2 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Commerce 
Secretary Ronald Brown has been cleared of allegations that he 
accepted 700,000 U.S dollars to help lift the U.S trade embargo 
against Vietnam. 
  A federal grand jury in Miami found that Brown had committed 
no wrongdoing, a government official, who declined to be named, 
announced today. 
  In a letter to Brown's attorney the country's Justice 
Department said that no further investigation was warranted and 
that accordingly it was closing the case. 
  Early last year the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) 
began looking into the allegations and the Justice Department's 
public integrity section was instructed to oversee the probe. 
  Brown had previously denied the allegations brought by Binh 
T. Ly, a Vietnamese American businessman, and had predicted he 
would be exonerated by the grand jury. 
  Last September, Brown acknowledged meeting three times with 
the former Vietnamese government official, Nguyen Van Hao, whom 
Ly accused of arranging the 700,000 dollars payment. But he 
firmly denied receiving any money or having any kind of business 
relationship with Hao. 
  The Vietnamese Government also denied Ly's allegations. 
  President Clinton publicly defended Brown last fall after 
two 
conservative Republican lawmakers asked for the appointment of a 
special prosecutor to investigate the allegations. 
  Ly has acknowledged that he has no direct evidence to 
support 
his allegations, which are based on conversations with Hao. 
  Responding to reporters today, Brown said "I'm pleased and 
I'm cleared of any wrongdoing."

  [Text] Washington, February 1 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President 
Bill Clinton today named Boston lawyer Deval Patrick to be 
deputy attorney general in charge of the civil rights division 
of the U.S. Justice Department. 
  Patrick, 37 and black, is a Harvard Law School graduate and 
a 
partner of the Boston firm Hill and Barlow. The Chicago native 
grew up in a poor and segregated neighborhood. 
  He once worked at the NAACP (National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People) legal defense and education fund 
on cases concerning voting rights and death penalty matters in 
the south. 
  Patrick's nomination filled a spot left vacant for months 
after the withdrawal of Lani Guinier, Clinton's first choice for 
the post. 
  Clinton abruptly withdrew Guinier's nomination after drawing 
criticism from some people in June, saying that he was surprised 
by the liberal bent to some of her writings on racial politics. 
The post has been vacant since Clinton took office on January 
20, 1993. 
  Wasting no time, conservatives called Patrick "a stealth 
Guinier." 
  But, "he understands the law is a tool to help real people 
with real problems," Clinton said in today's Oval Office 
announcement, flanked by Attorney General Janet Reno and Vice 
President Al Gore. 
  The Justice Department's civil rights division has protected 
civil liberties for "tens of millions of Americans," but there 
is still much more to be done, the U.S. President said.

  [Text] Moscow, February 1 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev said today that Moscow hopes the 
possible air raids in Bosnia-Herzegovina will not happen, 
stressing the need to hold additional talks over the issue. 
  At a meeting with visiting mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald 
Stoltenberg, co-chairmen of the international peace conference 
on the former Yugoslavia, Kozyrev described the planned air 
raids as "an extreme step." 
  Although in principle air raid is not excluded within the 
framework of UN Security Council resolutions, Kozyrev said, 
Moscow still keeps its initiative in the Security Council to 
make additional efforts to push for the peace process in the 
region. 
  Owen and Stoltenberg arrived here earlier today for 
discussion on measures to prevent violence in the Balkan region 
from further escalating, keep the Geneva negotiations process 
going and finally achieve a settlement. 
  The two peace mediators departed for Geneva this afternoon 
after their brief working visit here.

  [Text] Moscow, February 2 (XINHUA) -- Russian Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev today said that his country will maintain 
its military cooperation with Georgia related to the settlement 
of the Abkhazian and Ossetian issues. 
  Grachev arrived in Tbilisi, Georgia's capital, this morning, 
a day before Russian President Boris Yeltsin flies in for a 
one-day summit meeting with its leader Eduard Shevardnadze. 
  During the summit, both sides are expected to sign a package 
of accord which will include a treaty of friendship and 
cooperation. 
  Addressing members of the 405th Russian Regiment deployed in 
Georgia, Grachev said: "The future of our military and political 
cooperation with Georgia depends upon the stability of the 
republic's socio-political life and on settling the problem of 
the political status of Abkhazia and South Ossetia." 
  Abkhazia, an autonomous republic of Georgia, declared its 
independence in July 1992, while South Ossetia, an autonomous 
region of the former Soviet republic, proclaimed its 
independence in November 1991. The two rebel regions have been 
involved in a long-term and bloody conflict with Georgia. 
  Grachev also revealed that the coming Georgian-Russian 
summit 
will decide the future establishment of Russian military bases 
on Georgian territory in view of the expiry in 1995 of the 
interim agreement on Russian troops status in Georgia. 
  He said that Russia wants to keep its troops in Georgia and 
set up military bases but on the condition that it is done with 
respect for the treaty on collective security of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States. 
  "If the question of bases is solved during Yeltsin and 
Shevardnadze's summit, detailed arrangements will be worked out 
by the two countries' military experts," he added. 
  According to the minister, who will have a confidential 
meeting with Shevardnadze tonight, Russia plans to set up five 
military bases in the Caucasian region -- three in Georgia, one 
in Azerbaijan and the other in Armenia. 
  The minister also disclosed that Yeltsin and Russian Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin had agreed with the Defense 
Ministry the principles of expanding the Russian Army. 
  He suggested that up to 2.1 million men should be enlisted 
into the army by 1995 because its current strength of 1.5 
million, set by the country's defense legislation, is not enough 
to ensure the state's security. 
  Meanwhile, Georgian parliament deputy speaker Vakhtang 
Rcheulishvili said today that his country expects much from 
Yeltsin's visit. 
  However, in the Abkhazian capital of Sochi Government leader 
Sokrat Dzhindzholia said on Tuesday [2 February] that his 
country was opposed to the signing of a treaty of friendship and 
cooperation between Russia and Georgia. 
  "Only when the conflict between Georgia and Abkhazia is 
completely settled should such an agreement be signed," he 
declared. 
  Leaders of South Ossetia today also accused Moscow of 
inconsistency in its approach to the signing of such a treaty 
complaining that Georgia still refuses to hold talks with South 
Ossetia on its status.

  [Text] Moscow, February 2 (XINHUA) -- Ivan Rybkin, 
chairman of the Russian parliament's state Duma (the lower 
house), said today that the lawmakers might reject the planned 
Russian-Georgian treaty of friendship and cooperation, the 
INTERFAX NEWS AGENCY reported. 
  In a message to President Boris Yeltsin, Rybkin said the 
treaty, scheduled to be signed on Thursday [3 February] at the 
summit between Yeltsin and Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze 
in Tbilisi, capital of Georgia, would destabilize the situation 
in the Caucasian region. 
  Under the treaty, Russia would help Georgia form its armed 
forces and supply it with military technology, the report said. 
  The Georgian parliament's deputy speaker Vakhtang 
Rcheulishvili said his nation expected "much from Yeltsin's 
visit," adding that the visit would mark the beginning of a new 
stage in relations between the two countries. 
  However, Sokrat Dzhindzholia, leader of the secessionist 
Abkhazia region of Georgia, Tuesday expressed his opposition to 
the Russian- Georgian treaty. 
  He stressed that such an agreement should be signed only 
after the conflict between Georgia and Abkhazia is completely 
settled and the latter's political status determined. 
  Abkhazia, an autonomous republic of Georgia, declared its 
independence from the central government in July 1992. Since 
then, the two sides have been involved in a bloody conflict. 
  Meanwhile, leaders of South Ossetia, another autonomous 
region of Georgia, accused Russia today of "inconsistency" in 
its approach to signing the treaty with Georgia. 
  South Ossetia has had a long-time military conflict with 
Georgia since it declared independence from Tbilisi in November 
1991. 
  South Ossetian leaders complained that Georgia still refused 
to hold talks with South Ossetia on its political status. 
  They feared that Georgia would use the treaty with Russia 
against South Ossetia and Abkhazia. 
  Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, who arrived in 
Tbilisi today for preparations for Yeltsin's visit, stressed 
that the future of the military and political cooperation 
between Russia and Georgia partly depends upon the settlement of 
the political status of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.

  [Text] Moscow, February 1 (XINHUA) -- Georgian Defense 
Minister Gen. Karkarashvili announced his resignation today 
without giving any explanation for his decision. 
  The news center of the Georgian Defense Ministry had 
confirmed the resignation, but made no comment on the news, 
INTERFAX reported. 
  Meanwhile, President Eduard Shevardnadze's news office 
remained silent about the resignation. 
  Karkarashvili, a veteran of the Afghan war, became defense 
minister in 1993. He had asked for resignation twice before, 
but his request was rejected by Shevardnadze. 
  The minister had been scheduled to meet his Russian 
counterpart Pavel Grachev in Tbilisi on Wednesday.
