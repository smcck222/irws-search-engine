<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Xu Ye (1776 0396): "Yunnan, </F>
Guangxi Make Outstanding Achievements in Seizing Guns and Drugs"] 
  [Text] Kunming, 24 January (GUANGMING RIBAO)--This 
reporter has learned from today's commendation meeting on 
struggles against the smuggling of guns and drugs called by the 
Yunnan Frontier Defense Forces of the Armed Police, that 
Minister of Public Security Tao Siju recently signed a citation 
to cite both the Yunnan and Guangxi Frontier Defense 
Headquarters for their remarkable results in struggles against 
the smuggling of guns and drugs. The two frontier defense 
headquarters each gained a Collective Award of Merit. 
  Both Yunnan and Guangxi are located on China's southwestern 
border, facing a border line as long as nearly 5,000 km. 
Lawbreakers both inside and outside the country run rampant in 
these areas, engaging in the smuggling and trafficking of guns 
and drugs. In the wake of a work conference on struggles against 
the smuggling of guns and drugs, which was called by the 
Ministry of Public Security in June 1993, the public security 
and frontier defense forces in both Yunnan and Guangxi have 
carried out special-purpose campaigns against the smuggling of 
guns and drugs in an extensive and thoroughgoing way. Officers 
and men of the armed police have overcome numerous difficulties, 
carried out hard struggles, and attained remarkable results. 
According to a briefing, the Yunnan Frontier Defense 
Headquarters has cracked a total of 218 gun-smuggling cases and 
seized 119 military guns, 3,582 grenades, and 4,605 bullets, and 
cleared up 596 drug-trafficking cases and seized 427.477 kg of 
heroin and 283.77 kg of opium. The Guangxi Frontier Defense 
Headquarters solved a total of 100 gun-smuggling cases and 
captured 208 military guns, 148 grenades, and 5,722 bullets, and 
cracked 39 drug-trafficking cases and seized 4.849 kg of heroin 
and 64.537 kg of opium.

XINHUA reporter Ma Xiaochun (7456 2556 2504)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 3 Feb (XINHUA) -- Speaking at a meeting of 
cadres at and above the army level in the General Staff 
Department yesterday, Zhang Wannian, member of the Central 
Military Commission and chief of general staff, emphasized: 
Leading cadres should set a good example in implementing 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristic and his concept of army building in the 
new period, and work conscientiously and with one heart in 
continuing to vigorously promote army building and reform and 
successfully complete various tasks. 
  Setting the requirements for military affairs in the coming 
year, Zhang Wannian said: This year will be a crucial year for 
reform, opening up, and economic construction in China. The 
development of the situation demands that we further promote 
army building and reform, and raise the troops' combat 
capability in an all-round manner so as to provide a solid and 
powerful security guarantee for the country's reform, opening 
up, and modernization drive. In the coming year, we should 
persist in taking Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and his concept of army building in 
the new period as our basic guidelines; earnestly implement the 
guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee; further intensify army building in accordance with 
the general requirement of "being qualified politically and 
competent militarily, having a good work style, maintaining 
strict discipline, and being assured of adequate logistic 
support" set by Jiang Zemin; make the study of Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping the first and most 
important task; and use the theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics to arm the minds of all officers and 
men. We should continue to apply the principles of military 
strategy in the new period to obtain a comprehensive 
understanding of the work situation related to the army; and 
enhance the political awareness of the party commanding the gun, 
the awareness of the importance of being good at the strategy of 
making overall planning, the awareness of our profound 
responsibility toward state security and army building, and the 
awareness of being a role model in setting strict demands on 
ourselves, thereby raising the ideological awareness and 
military competence of the vast officers and men in the long 
run. We should reinforce the quality of the rank-and-file 
cadres, especially leaders at all levels; pay keen attention to 
the implementation of the "Outline for Grass-Roots Construction 
in the Army" re-issued by the Central Military Commission; and 
take new strides and score fresh achievements in improving party 
work style and promoting clean administration and socialist 
spiritual civilization in the coming year.

<F P=106> [By Lu Yu-shan (7627 6276 2619): "CPC Prohibits Armed </F>
Forces From Engaging in Business"] 
  [Text] Since the CPC took control of China, one of the 
most important principles it has always maintained is to keep 
the armed forces under the party's absolute control. When 
facing the challenge of the market economy, can this principle 
still be maintained? This has become a question concerning the 
CPC leaders. History has repeatedly proved that as long as the 
armed forces are being effectively control, the whole country 
will be kept under good control. Therefore, the CPC has long 
made good preparations for this, and other people do not need to 
worry. The CPC has worked out a series of countermeasures to 
ensure that the armed forces will not be affected by the 
torrents of the market economy, and the purity of the armed 
forces will be conscientiously maintained. 
  According sources from Zhongnanhai, the CPC authorities will 
soon adopt two important measures for the purpose of controlling 
the armed forces. One is to prohibit the armed forces from 
engaging in business activities, and the other is to 
substantially increase the military expenses this year in order 
to boost the morale of the troops. 
  Both measures are serious matters. If they are not arranged 
and carried out carefully, they may not achieve the expected 
results and may end up with a fiasco. First, the armed forces 
have developed into a gigantic economic entity in recent years, 
and have become the third largest foreign exchange earner in 
China (including the export of armaments). Although a large 
part of such foreign exchange income was handed over to the 
central authorities, the armed forces still gained political 
credit for such contributions. However, the economic benefit 
was a strong magnet for military personnel, who are living in 
difficult conditions. In the previous years, the central 
authorities could not allocate substantial amounts of money to 
support the armed forces, and the military units were allowed to 
engage in profit-seeking business activities. The vested 
business interests of the armed forces have become a fait 
accompli, so the central authorities can no longer turn a blind 
eye to it. 
  However, while engaging in business activities, the armed 
forces also found that its combat strength declined. Moreover, 
the central authorities decided to further reduce the size of 
the troops from some 3 million people to 2.5 million people (but 
the pace of disarmament will not be too quick). Thus, the 
combat strength of the armed forces will become more 
questionable. In addition, as the armed forced are involved in 
economic activities, there are increasing opportunities for 
their cooperation with local governments, and this may enable 
them to form a certain type of alliance against the central 
authorities. This will be very unfavorable to the central 
authorities. Therefore, the central leadership must do 
something to remove such hidden perils. 
  Through consideration and after consulting major military 
leaders, the CPC central leadership decided to "again focus the 
efforts of the armed forces on national defense construction by 
adopting some orderly steps." To put it more plainly, that is 
to prohibit the armed forces from engaging in business 
activities. 
  Recently, when talking about government work, Jiang Zemin, 
CPC Central Military Commission Chairman, and State Council 
Premier Li Peng announced this intention by saying that "the 
central leadership has decided to stop the production and 
business activities undertaken by the armed forces, and transfer 
all the enterprises run by military units to local civilian 
institutions." This decision will produce a major impact. Will 
the military units which are making handsome profits obediently 
give up their money-making means? What financial resources will 
be used to support the armed forces then? And will this change 
the relationship between the armed forces and the central 
authorities? 
  It is learned that the central authorities will adopt three 
measures to solve these questions. First, personnel affairs 
related to enterprises currently run by the armed forces should 
be properly arranged so that they may officially be separated 
from the military establishment and the enterprises can be 
turned into independent legal persons. The enterprises 
originally run by the armed forces will be turned into 
state-owned enterprises run by demobilized soldiers as 
representatives of the legal person appointed by the state, and 
the state will protect their gains and interests. 
  Second, the state will increase the military budget and 
ensure that the living conditions of military personnel will be 
improved. Jiang Zemin and Li Peng both said: "Military funds 
must be allocated to the armed forces, which should depend on 
the state's allocations. As the commodity economy is being 
developed in the whole country, people have improved their 
livelihood but the troops still live in rather difficult 
conditions. This may affect the work of the armed forces. Then 
what should be done? After the enterprises run by the armed 
forces are taken over by the state, the central authorities will 
increase the appropriations to the armed forces. As the armed 
forces are carrying out the mission of defending the motherland, 
funds must be allocated to them." Therefore, at the forthcoming 
Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress, it is 
certain that the military budget will be directly and indirectly 
increased by a big margin. Last year, military expenditure 
increased by 14 percent over the previous year, and this marked 
the most prominent increase among all budget items. It is 
expected that this year, the military budget will be increased 
by at least 10 percent. 
  The third measure is to convince military leaders 
(especially those at advanced ages) and solicit their 
endorsement and support. In the past, in addition to stressing 
military modernization, they always stressed the need to 
maintain the quality of the armed forces. In general, the old 
guard, being different from the younger officers, tend to accept 
the opinion of the central leadership on giving consideration to 
overall interests. It is learned that the two vice chairmen of 
the Central Military Commission, Liu Huaqing and Zhang Zhen, 
have agreed in principle to shift the enterprises run by the 
armed forces to the state. However, they held that this matter 
must be handled prudently and properly. 
  If the enterprises run by the armed forces are actually 
separated from the armed forces, this will promote the process 
of turning the armed forces into the hands of the state. 
However, in the eyes of the CPC, the most important purpose of 
this change is to ensure that the armed forces will have to rely 
on the state's financial support (and the state is also the 
party). Eventually, the armed forces will remain subject to the 
party's absolute control. This will prevent the armed forces 
from possessing their own financial sources and thus becoming 
independent from the party's control. That is, this will 
prevent a tendency towards independence in the armed forces.

<F P=106> [By reporter Tang Pingyue (0781 1627 1471): "At an All-Army </F>
Meeting, PLA General Political Department Director Yu Yongbo 
Urges Conscientiously Implementing General Secretary Jiang's 
Report and Thoroughly Studying the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 29 Jan (JIEFANGJUN BAO) -- At the All-Army 
Conference of Propaganda Chiefs held this afternoon, Yu Yongbo, 
director of the General Political Department of the People's 
Liberation Army [PLA], stressed that the most fundamental and 
important task for implementing General Secretary Jiang Zemin's 
report and the National Propaganda and Ideological Work 
Conference is to focus attention on studying Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
profoundly studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping. 
  Yu Yongbo said that the current National Propaganda and 
Ideological Work Conference is an important meeting of overall 
significance held by the CPC Central Committee at the crucial 
period when China is establishing a socialist market economic 
system and carrying out the socialist modernization program. It 
is the concrete embodiment of Deng Xiaoping's principle of doing 
two kinds of work simultaneously and attaching importance to 
both. It fully reflects the complete and accurate understanding 
and mastery of the party's basic line by the third generation of 
collective leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core. The 
implementation of the spirit of the conference will be of great 
significance to strengthening and improving propaganda and 
ideological work in the new situation and strengthening the 
building of socialist spiritual civilization and also be of 
far-reaching influence on China's reform, opening up, and the 
socialist modernization program. 
  Yu Yongbo pointed out: In light of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
the spirit of the 14th party congress, and in view of the new 
problems and circumstances facing reform and opening up, 
particularly the establishment of a socialist market economic 
system, General Secretary Jiang Zemin, in his report delivered 
at the conference, made comprehensive and profound expositions 
on the principles, fundamental tasks, and guiding ideology for 
propaganda and ideological work, which illuminated the direction 
for doing well propaganda and ideological work at present and 
for a period in the future and served as the ground for 
strengthening and improving Army ideological and political work. 
The party committees and political organs at all levels must 
earnestly study, understand, and resolutely implement them. In 
practical work, we must also implement the guiding important 
speeches made by Comrades Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, and Ding Guangen. 
  To implement General Secretary Jiang Zemin's report and the 
spirit of the current National Propaganda and Ideological Work 
Conference, Yu Yongbo emphasized, the most fundamental and 
important task is to pay attention to the study of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. The primary task of the whole Army's political 
work this year is to study well Volume 3 of the Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping. At the crucial period of reform, 
opening up, and establishing a socialist market economic system, 
the study of Deng's works is required for the Army to toe the 
CPC Central Committee's line ideologically, politically, and in 
action as well as to establish a powerful spiritual mainstay in 
the Army and fundamentally enhance unity and increase combat 
effectiveness. In accordance with the requirement of the 
Central Military Commission and the General Political 
Department, we stepped up the study of Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping at the previous stage 
and launched a new drive of study throughout the Army. It was 
indeed a good beginning. Through the implementation of the 
spirit of the National Propaganda and Ideological Work 
Conference, we should further increase our understanding of the 
importance of applying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm the mind 
of officers and men of the whole Army, and make the activities 
of studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping more profound, solid, and fruitful. 
  In the new situation, Yu Yongbo pointed out, it is the great 
historical responsibility of the comrades engaged in political 
work, particularly those engaged in propaganda work, to follow 
General Secretary Jiang's instructions, arm people with 
scientific theories, guide them with correct opinion, mold them 
with lofty spirit, and encourage them with outstanding works. 
Yu Yongbo made a three-point requirements for cadres of the 
whole Army engaged in propaganda work: First, step up 
self-study, which should be currently focused on studying well 
Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. 
Second, cadres engaged in propaganda work should be good at 
making thorough investigation and study. Third, take an active 
part in central work and expand the sphere of education work. 
  At the conference, Xu Caihou, deputy director of the General 
Political Department, made specific proposals on studying 
General Secretary Jiang's important speech: First, realize the 
historical responsibility of propaganda and ideological work 
from a high plane of the times and overall situation, brace up, 
and attain better achievements. Second, keep a firm grip of the 
fundamental principle of propaganda and ideological work and 
make strenuous efforts to implement the fundamental task of 
propaganda and ideological work. Third, carry out propaganda and 
ideological work closely around the Army's central task and 
offer ideological guarantee and spiritual motivation to the 
modernization program. Fourth, enhance political firmness and 
awareness and have a firm grasp of the correct ideological 
guidance for the media. Fifth, focus attention on training 
"people with lofty ideals, moral integrity, better education, 
and a sense of discipline" and further strengthen ideological 
and political work. Sixth, strengthen leadership over 
propaganda and ideological work and build up a contingent of 
propagandists who are political aware, professionally 
proficient, and honest and upright in their ways. 
  The current All-Army Conference of Propaganda Chiefs is a 
part of the National Propaganda and Ideological Work. We have 
listened to the important reports at the conference, held 
serious discussions in connection with the Army's reality, 
further realized our mission, and enhanced our confidence. 
Directors of the political departments under the major units of 
the troops garrisoned in Beijing were present at today's 
conference.

<F P=106> [By reporter Han Chien-hua (7281 0494 5478): "Li Laizhu </F>
Appointed Beijing Military Region Commander"] 
  [Text] Communist Chinese official sources confirmed 
yesterday that the post of Beijing Military Region commander had 
been taken over by Deputy Commander Li Laizhu. This personnel 
change in a major military region indicates that Communist China 
has quietly launched major personnel changes in local military 
commands in the wake of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee, held at the end of last year. 
  A few days ago, Li Laizhu accompanied Jiang Zemin, general 
secretary of the CPC Central Committee, on an inspection tour of 
Shanxi in his capacity as commander of Beijing Military Region. 
In its report, the official XINHUA News Agency has confirmed 
that former Beijing Military Region Commander Wang Chengbin has 
left office and his post has been taken by Deputy Commander Li 
Laizhu. 
  A Beijing source pointed out: The new wave of military 
personnel changes is the largest since the reorganization of 
major military region leadership in July 1990. In addition to 
making the ranks of officers younger in average age and raising 
their level of professional competence, it is chiefly aimed at 
consolidating Central Military Commission Chairman Jiang Zemin's 
status among local army units. Last June, Jiang promoted seven 
senior generals at one go. In conjunction with the personnel 
changes in local military commands, this is aimed at maintaining 
stability in the post-Deng Xiaoping era and making prior 
arrangements. 
  It is pointed out that there have been high-level personnel 
changes in four military regions. These are: 
  --Beijing Military Region: Li Laizhu takes over from Wang 
Chengbin as commander; 
  --Shenyang Military Region: Political Commissar Song Keda no 
longer holds his post; 
  --Nanjing Military Region: Fang Zuqi takes over from Liu 
Anyuan as political commissar; 
  --Chengdu Military Region: Former Political Commissar Zhang 
Gong no longer holds his post, which reportedly is taken by 
Zhang Zhijian, deputy commander of Beijing Military Region. 
  Moreover, personnel reshuffles are also being conducted 
among 
leaders of the Navy and the Academy of Military Sciences.

  [Text] Guiyang, February 3 (XINHUA) -- The less developed 
rural enterprises in southwest China's Guizhou Province are 
taking active efforts to ally themselves with local military 
factories. 
  The 100 or so military enterprises were set up within the 
mountainous areas of Guizhou chiefly during the 1960s when China 
strengthened national defense. They are strong in technology, 
equipment and quality products. 
  Nowadays, these plants, which are turning out more and more 
civilian products, have to break through their high walls to 
meet with new demands in China's developing market economy. 
They need more land and labor and part of their civilian 
products have to get necessary spares locally. 
  Meanwhile, local rural people need technology and talented 
personnel to help them shake off poverty. 
  Seeing that local counties and military plants are 
complementary, officials helped to bridge the two by inviting 
leaders of the military plants to visit township and village 
enterprises. 
  As a result, 38 local counties have introduced funds, 
equipment and technology from the military plants. Some 130 
integrated complexes have been set up to deal with the 
production of coal, phosphorus, lead, antimony, marble and 
tobacco with the help of military plants. 
  The complexes mainly produce necessary parts for 
refrigerators, motor vehicles, tractors and satellite ground 
receivers. 
  Last year, rural industries of the province turned out 10 
billion yuan worth of products, a 30 percent increase over the 
previous year.

<F P=106> ["Special Feature" by Hong Fei (7703 7378)] </F>
  [Text] The levying of the value-added land tax by the 
Chinese Government beginning from 1 January this year has evoked 
strong repercussions among real estate circles in Hong Kong and 
Taiwan. Some people pointed out that the tax rate is too high, 
it hits both speculators and honest businessmen, and if 
developers make no profits, they will be compelled to give up 
their development plans. In the middle of January, a Hong Kong 
delegation consisting of 30 people (including real estate 
businessmen, surveyors, lawyers, and accountants), went to 
Beijing to air their views and to ask the authorities not to go 
too far in levying the value-added land tax, but to ensure 
appropriate profits for honest Hong Kong developers. 
  According to the "Provisional Regulations on Value-Added 
Land 
Tax," anyone who transfers real estate and earns an income shall 
pay tax on the added value according to the regulations. The 
regulations state that four progressive rates shall be applied 
in levying the value-added land tax, including: 1) A rate of 30 
percent shall be levied on the amount of the increment value 
that does not exceed 50 percent of the total amount of 
deductions; 2) A rate of 40 percent shall be levied on the 
amount of the increment value that exceeds 50 percent but is 
lower than 100 percent of the total amount of deductions; 3) A 
rate of 50 percent shall be levied on the amount of the 
increment value that exceeds 100 percent but is less than 200 
percent of the total amount of deductions; 4) A rate of 60 
percent shall be levied on the amount of the increment value 
that exceeds 200 percent of the total amount of deductions. 
  According to reports, the aim of authorities in formulating 
the regulations on the value-added land tax is to standardize 
the business order of the land and real estate market, 
rationally readjust benefits from value-added land, and 
safeguard state rights and interests. It happened that the 
Constitution revised in 1986 states "the right to use land owned 
by the state can be transferred according to law," and that 
since foreign businessmen were allowed to develop and manage 
large stretches of land in 1990, the real estate business has 
developed vigorously in all provinces and municipalities on the 
mainland, large quantities of land have been approved for 
development, and the number of real estate development companies 
has increased to thousands upon thousands. Therefore, many 
undesirable practices have emerged. For example, local 
governments, in a bid to attract foreign land developers, 
compete with each other in lowering land prices, approve at 
random the establishment of development zones, and development 
companies which have bought large stretches of land have engaged 
in land speculation. At the same time, high-grade houses and 
houses to be sold abroad constitute a greater part of the 
structure of land investment. As a result, the development of 
real estate was not balanced and was partially out of control. 
For example, according to the national plan for 1992, 2 million 
mu of land should have been approved for development, but 3.6 
million mu of land was actually approved, exceeding the target 
by 80 percent. The input of funds on a large scale into the 
real estate industry has also affected the development of the 
energy, communications, raw material, and other industries. 
  Mainland specialists pointed out that an important cause of 
the appearance of overheated real estate business is that the 
burden of tax on buying and selling land and real estate is on 
the light side. For example, foreign real estate companies only 
need to pay a three percent commodity house business tax and 
they reap substantial profits. Therefore, more and more foreign 
investors have invested in real estate. 
  The original intention of the Chinese Government in levying 
value-added land tax is to regulate and control the real estate 
market on the mainland in addition to increasing revenue from 
taxes. According to analysis by specialists, another purpose of 
increasing the value-added land tax is evidently to curb 
construction of excessively large quantities of garden villas, 
holiday resorts, and high-class apartments which have taken up a 
large amount of resources, which have not much to do with the 
ordinary people, and which do not have clear market prospects, 
and to guide the developers to make investment in the 
construction of common residential houses for domestic sales, 
which have a great market demand and are closely related to the 
people's living standard, and to make investment in power 
plants, highways, and other industries. This can be said to be a 
means of macro regulation and control. 
  However, because of a different considerations of interest, 
the increase in the value-added land tax on the mainland has 
evoked much dissatisfaction in Hong Kong and Taiwan. A real 
estate businessman said that in additional to paying 30 to 60 
percent of value-added land tax according to the regulations on 
the mainland, it is necessary to pay 33 percent of profit tax 
for profits from selling houses. This means double taxation. 
According to this way of calculating taxes, the maximum amount 
of taxes to be paid for investment in real estates may reach 73 
percent, and the minimum tax rate is also as high as 53 percent. 
Because investment risks and investment returns are out of 
proportion, some real estate developers may suspend their 
projects to avoid losses. Guangzhou Mayor Li Ziliu also pointed 
out that according to the method of calculation of the central 
authorities, the implementation of the new tax system will raise 
production costs of investment by 5 percent and lower profits by 
30 percent. If this rate is put into practice, investors will 
not be able to make any profits. However, he pointed out that 
the added value tax is a kind of local tax and the local 
government can formulate detailed rules for implementation 
themselves. Guangzhou has its own standard in formulating the 
detailed rules. Therefore, he said that Guangzhou's investors 
may set their minds at rest. A director of the China Department 
of the Hong Kong Jones Lang &amp; Wooten Consultants held that 
the 
levying of the value-added land tax on the mainland is mainly 
aimed at short-term speculators and its impact on the real 
estate market as a whole will not be too great. Some people 
expected that the temperature in real estate investment on the 
mainland this spring will fall, but in the latter half of the 
year, the real estate market will tend to become more vigorous 
again. The number of transactions will be no fewer than that of 
the same period last year. The selling prices of various kinds 
of real estate will rise by 15 to 25 percent. 
  According to reports, the Chinese Government, in a bid to 
speed up the construction of residential houses for urban 
residents, is encouraging foreign businessmen to take part in 
plans for the development of inexpensive residential houses. 
Major Hong Kong financial groups have responded positively to 
this. The New World Development Company Ltd. and Cheung Kong 
(Holdings) Ltd. have already signed a letter of intent on the 
development of inexpensive houses. Various signs have indicated 
that China's real estate market has broad prospects and is still 
attracting Hong Kong businessmen's investment in development.

<F P=106> [By trainee reporter Yang Fan (2799 1581): "Chinese Finance </F>
Minister on Value-Added Land Tax"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 1 Feb (WEN WEI PO) -- Finance minister Liu 
Zhongli told reporters here today that the provisional 
regulations on levying a value-added land tax, as a law approved 
by the State Council, must be strictly enforced. The localities 
must comply with the regulations. The laws and regulations 
formulated by themselves without authorization are all null and 
void. In view of the proposals made by foreign investors, there 
will be some readjustment in the detailed rules for 
implementation to be promulgated very soon. 
  China's real estate developed rapidly last year and the year 
before, Liu Zhongli said, but the government failed to introduce 
effective tax categories. Now the State Council has approved 
the regulations on levying a value-added land tax. As a law, it 
must be enforced. 
  He clarified some misunderstanding. The value-added land tax 
is not merely levied on foreign businessmen because tax laws 
apply to both Chinese and foreign-funded enterprises and 
individuals. Liu said that the regulations are promulgated to 
crack down on speculation in real estate. Actually, the returns 
from real estate go as high as 30 to 40 percent. 
  Liu Zhongli said that he had heard opinions aired by foreign 
businessmen on the new regulations. He said that their opinions 
and proposals will be taken into account in the detailed rules 
for implementation to be promulgated soon. 
  The minister said that the detailed rules constitute a kind 
of tax law. One of the principles of tax reform is a fair tax 
burden and unification of tax laws. Liu said that he had not 
heard about the news of Guangzhou and Hainan promulgating their 
own sets of tax laws. If some localities have promulgated their 
own regulations on levying the value-added land tax, they will 
all be null and void. 
  Liu pointed out that the value-added land charges collected 
by Shenzhen and other localities in the past will automatically 
become void following promulgation of the new value-added land 
tax. All localities should abide by the unified tax system of 
the Finance Ministry. Despite the implementation of the new tax 
system, Liu said, preferential policies for the special economic 
regions will remain unchanged. The value-added land tax is the 
only thing which belongs to the state. 
  On the question of the impact of the new tax system on 
foreign investors, Liu Zhongli made an analysis of three 
aspects: First, in the value-added tax, foreign businessmen, 
who have signed contracts with China before 31 December 1993 and 
who have a tax burden, will only have to return the amount of 
taxes earned in the next five years. Second, company and 
enterprise income taxes have not increased or decreased, but 
domestic enterprises are drawing closer to foreign-funded ones. 
Third, the rate of personal income tax of 90 percent of the 
foreign staff dropped while only 10 percent rose, with the 
extent exceeding not more than 5 percent.

"Interviewing Yuan Zheng, Director of State Land Department, on 
Value-Added Land Tax"] 
  [Text] Yuan Zheng, director of Guangdong Province State 
Land Department, said that Guangdong Province will not be an 
exception and will implement the value-added land tax policy 
promulgated by the central authorities this year. However, they 
will continue to reflect to the central authorities the strong 
reactions of foreign businessmen. 
  During an interview with MING PAO yesterday, Yuan said 
frankly that they had recently heard quite a lot of strong views 
about the value-added land tax from foreign businessmen. 
However, the state is listening to views from various quarters 
and will soon publish detailed rules on the implementation of 
the value-added land tax. Therefore, before the rules are 
published, the Guangdong authorities concerned will accurately 
reflect the views of foreign businessmen to the central 
authorities. 
  He said that in the past, the local governments of some 
cities and counties in Guangdong Province had formulated their 
own regulations on levying value-added taxes on a trial basis. 
After the central authorities published regulations on levying 
a unified value-added tax, Guangdong of course will implement 
the regulations by the central authorities. However, he 
believes that the detailed rules on the implementation of the 
value-added land tax to be published by the central authorities 
will certainly have relatively great flexibility. 
  He said that the purpose of levying the value-added land tax 
is to crack down on land speculation. However, if the 
first-hand land market is strictly controlled by the state and 
the management of the second-hand land market is strengthened, 
the practice of speculation can be curbed. At present, the fact 
that the practice of speculation has developed to a red-hot 
state is a problem whose origin lies in the lagging behind of 
the management of the second-hand market. For example, in some 
places, the work on large quantities of title deeds for houses 
is in arrears and this has provided loopholes of which 
speculators take advantage. Yuan also talked about the 
situation of approving land for development across Guangdong 
Province last year and this year. He said that this year, the 
amount of land to be used for various purposes in the whole 
province will be limited to 465,000 mu, of which land for real 
estate will total 116,000 mu, slightly less than the 136,000 mu 
of land for real estate last year. 
  Last year, the revenue from sales of land throughout the 
province was more than 8.6 billion yuan and in the previous year 
it was 9.4 billion yuan. This year, the sales of land are 
expected to bring in about 9 billion yuan to the provincial 
government treasury. 
  Yesterday, Yuan also gave a brief account of the situation 
of 
putting things in order in development zones across the 
province. During the peak period in 1993 there were as many as 
315 development zones of various kinds across the provinces. 
After things have been put in order and rectified, only 53 
development zones remain at present (approved by the State 
Council or the provincial government). Besides, 14 are being 
examined and verified. All the land in more than 200 
development zones which do not have the necessary conditions has 
been taken back and the total amount of such land has reached 
580,000 mu.

<F P=106> [By reporter Liu Hong (0491 4767)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 31 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- The reform 
of the separate taxation system, which is to be implemented from 
1 January this year, indicates that China's financial reform has 
entered a new track of operation. 
  Undoubtedly, the purpose of introducing the separate 
taxation 
system is to establish a financial system suited to the market 
economic system and to arouse the enthusiasm of both the center 
and localities. 
  However, we cannot evade the reality that implementation of 
the separate taxation system will have both positive and 
negative effects. Bai Jingming, associate professor of the 
Financial Science Research Institute under the Finance Ministry 
and doctor of economics, said: The existing contract system 
implemented by localities has proved in practice to have more 
defects than advantages. It has resulted in departmentalism and 
economic barriers erected between regions and has weakened the 
unity and complementarity of macroeconomic policies between 
central and local governments. But the separate taxation system 
can bring about the following benefits to economic development. 
  First, the separate taxation system will enable central 
revenue to become a steadily increasing mechanism and enhance 
the capability of macroeconomic regulation and control of the 
central government. Second, the separate taxation system will 
enable the government at all levels to show more concern for 
cultivating tax sources, consciously broaden sources of taxes 
within the scope permitted by law and policies, and not rely on 
tax exemptions to develop the economy. Third, the separate 
taxation system will speed up the establishment and perfection 
of China's financial budgetary system at all levels, enhance the 
budgetary binding mechanism, and gradually increase the 
efficiency of spending. 
  Dr Bai Jingming pointed out at the same time: Implementation 
of the separate taxation system in the early period is likely to 
yield the following negative effects: 
  First, the status quo of the interest structure remains 
unchanged during the initial stage of financial reform and no 
major changes will be effected in the behavior of local 
governments. However, the center will take over duties imposed 
on cigarette and liquor, which are high and profitable, a move 
which will easily dampen the enthusiasm of localities. 
  Second, if 1993 is taken as the base period for central 
finance to check and ratify local tax return, the sharp increase 
in the previous year will relatively slow down this year's tax 
revenue and increase pressure on the balance of this year's 
finance. If deficits grow for this reason, it will inevitably 
increase the issue of treasury bonds or even exert pressure on 
inflation. 
  Third, following implementation of the separate taxation 
system, local governments will vigorously work out measures to 
increase revenue and bargain with the central government on the 
establishment of the local taxation system. Meanwhile, as the 
existing separate taxation system has not yet smashed the 
structure which determines the distribution of income according 
to the relationships of administrative subordination, local 
governments will continue to adopt measures to protect local 
interests. 
  Fourth, following the exercise of financial management at 
different levels, the right to spending of local governments 
will increase. As a result, local finance will allocate funds 
to profitable trades and make less investment in infrastructure, 
education, and science and technology. 
  Fifth, as the separate taxation system has not touched the 
structure of regional distribution, the previous interests are 
still taken as the base figure of tax return. This results in 
uneven regional development. Hence, it will be difficult to 
narrow the wide gap between the eastern and western regions 
within a short period. 
  Financial experts hold that ultimate implementation of 
financial reform will be an arduous course. To ensure that the 
reform will be introduced smoothly and not go out of shape, 
there are still great difficulties ahead. The separate taxation 
system is in fact a division of interests, which will bring 
about friction between the center and localities, if not 
properly handled. Hence, it is a pressing task at the moment to 
standardize and legalize the transfer payment system as quickly 
as possible. Moreover, we should establish the separate 
taxation system below the provincial level as early as possible 
to ensure the integrity of the system.

People's Bank of China; Wu Yi, minister of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation; Chen Jinhua, deputy director of the State

reporter "at the turn of the year"; place not given: "Plan for 
Building the Market Economic Structure" --first four paragraphs 
are LIAOWANG introduction] 
  [Text] The reform of China's economic structure, which 
started in 1978, has braved the wind and rain and unswervingly 
forged ahead for 15 years toward its market-oriented goal. Now 
we have entered the crucial period of changing from smashing the 
old system to the building of a new one. 
  When such a crucial reform will soon spread nationwide, the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, which 
is a great milestone, has outlined the framework, fighting 
objective, and overall blueprint of a new system for the people 
of the whole country and has laid down the program for action to 
advance. The recent national economic work conference has also 
made specific arrangements for this year's reform tasks. 
  What action should be taken in the year designed to lay the 
foundation for constructing the building of the socialist market 
economy? 
  At the turn of the year, a LIAOWANG reporter interviewed He 
Guanghui, deputy director of the State Commission for 
Restructuring the Economy, in charge of the country's economic 
work; Financial Minister Liu Zhongli; Zhou Zhengqing, deputy 
president of the People's Bank of China; Wu Yi, minister of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation; Chen Jinhua, deputy 
director of the State Planning Commission; and Wang Zhongyu, 
minister of the State Commission for Economy and Trade, and 
asked the leaders of the six ministries to tell our readers 
about the plan for constructing the building of the market 
economic structure in 1994. 
<H5>  How To Reconstruct the Structure for State Enterprises </H5>
  The establishment of a modern enterprise system is an 
essential link of economic structural reform as a whole. It 
also constitutes the main part of this year's reform of state 
enterprises. 
  The seven options for a system change. 
  How should a system change be effected in state enterprises? 
He Guanghui pointed out the following ways: 
  --Gradually introduce a reorganization of the company system 
first in the properly managed enterprises. A small number of 
large, efficient, profitable enterprises, which meet the 
industrial policies, can be directly reorganized into a state 
holding or shareholding company. Most of the competitive 
enterprises which conform to the industrial policies can be 
reorganized into limited liability companies funded by the state 
and other corporations. Enterprises of special trades can be 
reorganized into limited liability companies funded exclusively 
by the state. 
  --Enterprises with the proper conditions may establish 
shareholding limited companies or limited liability companies in 
cooperation with foreign firms. Foreign firms may make direct 
investment or become shareholders. The newly established joint 
enterprises should be operated in light of the new system. 
  --Further expand mergers and combinations between 
enterprises. In light of the varying conditions of enterprises, 
the means of offering capital, mergers, and partial takeovers 
may be adopted. If both parties are state enterprises, they may 
amalgamate without compensating each other, based on 
voluntariness and with the approval of the competent 
departments. Whatever form is applied, it is necessary to 
appropriately handle debts and settle down the staff members of 
the predecessor. 
  --State enterprises which have superior land resources, but 
which cannot be located in the urban areas, may become new 
enterprises with a new mechanism by undergoing removal 
transformation and shifting to the production of other products. 
  --Small state enterprises may undergo reform which 
integrates 
leasing and selling with contracted operations or practice the 
shareholding cooperation system. In selling, it is necessary to 
introduce the competition mechanism, and adopt the method of 
public bidding and auctions. Regarding those without proper 
conditions, they can only be sold on the basis of an agreement 
and the prices must be determined through a certain procedure. 
Those that can be sold once and for all can be leased first and 
sold later. In other words, the state can first collect the 
working capital, receive charges for the use of fixed assets, 
and then sell the fixed assets when the conditions are ripe. 
  --State enterprises which have been poorly managed for a 
long 
time, whose products are unsalable, whose assets cannot offset 
the debts, and which cannot be reorganized through other forms, 
should go bankrupt. 
  --The system of companies assuming sole responsibility must 
be practiced in all new construction projects. Regarding all 
production and operation projects, it is necessary to first set 
up a company and then start construction. Projects which are 
under construction should also set up, as quickly as possible, 
companies in which the relations of property rights and 
responsibilities are clear and where government administration 
is separated from enterprise management. 
  He Guanghui pointed out that the collective enterprises in 
urban areas, township enterprises, nongovernmental scientific 
and technological enterprises, and other types of enterprises 
are facing a major topic: They should make explorations through 
various forms to gradually reorganize themselves to a 
shareholding company or a joint-stock cooperation enterprise. 
We should also encourage private enterprises to reorganize 
themselves into standard companies and rationalize their 
behavior. 
<H5>  The Pressing Task at the Moment Is To Do Basic Work Well </H5>
  He Guanghui said that the pressing task at the moment is to 
do the following basic work: Increase the decisionmaking power 
of enterprises, accelerate the pace of state enterprises 
changing their operational mechanism and transforming their 
organizational structure, deepen the labor, personnel, and 
distribution reform within enterprises, earnestly implement the 
"Rules for Enterprise Financial Affairs" and "Regulations for 
Enterprise Accounting," and speed up the transition to a 
scientific enterprise financial and accounting system which 
conforms to international standards. It is necessary to 
reappraise the stocks and assets of enterprises, define property 
rights, screen creditors' rights and debts, evaluate assets, and 
verify the property of enterprises. 
  State enterprises are now bearing a heavy historical burden. 
In order to smoothly effect a change in the system of state 
enterprises, He Guanghui pointed out: First, it is necessary to 
reasonably alleviate the debt burden of enterprises. Regarding 
the debts caused by "the change from allocation to loans," the 
form of "changing loans to investment" can be adopted to turn 
part of it into state capital. We should also study effective 
methods for resolving other forms of debts. Second, it is 
necessary to resolve the problem of insufficient accumulation of 
social insurance for old workers. In the course of property 
rights reforms, which include auctions, mergers, and joint stock 
reform, a certain proportion should be withdrawn from state 
assets to contribute to the social insurance fund. Third, it is 
necessary to gradually separate the nonproductive undertakings 
from enterprises and resolve the problem of "social 
responsibility" of enterprises. Fourth, it is necessary to 
gradually resolve the overstaffed problem of old enterprises. 
Policies and measures should be worked out to encourage some 
staff and workers to seek employment in township enterprises, 
three kinds of foreign-funded enterprises, and private 
enterprises. Some others should be encouraged to become 
self-employed workers. 
<H5>  Prevent the Phenomenon of Losing Shape </H5>
  In the change of system effected among state enterprises, He 
Guanghui especially emphasized, it is necessary to prevent and 
take note of the practice of merely changing the factory plate, 
but not the mechanism. He said that the newly established 
shareholding limited companies and limited liability companies 
should set up and perfect their internal organizations, exercise 
scientific and efficient management, and make efforts to effect 
a change in operational mechanisms strictly in accordance with 
laws and regulations. While using foreign capital to transform 
old enterprises, it is necessary to note two points: First, 
changing plates but not the system, or becoming a joint venture 
in name but with no foreign investment at all; and second, while 
the workshops, departments, or units intend to develop joint 
ventures with foreign partners, it is necessary to handle well 
the relations between the part and the whole and prevent the 
practice of offering good workshops, departments, and projects 
to form joint ventures, while leaving the poorly managed ones to 
the state. 
  Compared with past reforms, Liu Zhongli said, the current 
financial reform is focused on changing the mechanism and 
creating basic conditions for establishing a socialist market 
economic system, while making no major readjustment of the 
existing distribution structure. 
<H5>  The Contents and Principles of Financial and Taxation Reform </H5>
  Introduce the reform of a separate tax system. First, the 
scope of expenses at all levels should be reasonably determined 
in light of the division of authority between the central and 
local governments. Second, central and local revenue should be 
divided in light of the tax categories and the proportion of 
central revenue should gradually increase in accordance with the 
principle which integrates the authority controlling enterprises 
and undertakings with financial power. Third, central financial 
bodies will implement the system of tax return and transfer 
payments to the localities. Fourth, two sets of taxation 
organs, the State Taxation Bureau and local taxation bureaus, 
will be set up to coordinate the implementation of the separate 
tax system. To guarantee the formation of the new mechanism, 
Liu Zhongli stressed, the provincial authorities, in light of 
the principles and requirements of the new central and 
provincial financial systems, should formulate specific measures 
for the cities and counties to implement the separate tax 
system. The basic framework of reform must not be distorted. 
  In accordance with the principle of "unifying the tax laws, 
levying taxes in a fair manner, simplifying the tax system, and 
rationally separating powers, it is necessary to introduce 
reform of the taxation system. First, an exchange tax system 
based on increment taxes, with consumption and business taxes as 
a supplement, should be established. Increment taxes should be 
levied in the links of commodity production, wholesale, retail 
sales, and imports. The method of levying increment taxes 
should be improved, and the system of tax deduction and tax 
indication in invoices should be implemented. Based on the 
general readjustment carried out by applying increment taxes, a 
further consumption tax will be levied on some special consumer 
goods, which are to undergo special readjustment. Business 
taxes will continue to be applicable to the trades of the 
tertiary industry, except commerce, which have not yet 
implemented the increment tax system. 
  Second, unify the income tax of domestic enterprises, 
change the past practice of levying taxes in light of the 
ownership of enterprises, and impose a unified income tax of 33 
percent. In light of the actual situation, a preferential tax 
rate may be imposed for a period of time on a small number of 
enterprises whose profits are relatively low. Meanwhile, the 
state enterprise regulatory tax will be revoked. Third, 
establish a unified personal income tax system. 
  We should reform the profit distribution system for state 
enterprises, lower the income tax of state enterprises to 33 
percent along with reform of the tax system, remove the energy 
and communications key construction fund and budgetary 
regulatory fund levied on enterprises, and gradually establish 
the distribution system of sharing dividends according to 
investment returns, sharing interests according to the amount of 
capital, or delivery of profits after paying taxes. In light of 
the relevant stipulations of the "Rules for Financial Affairs of 
Enterprises" and "Rules for Enterprise Accounting," the 
interests for the new and old fixed assets loans of enterprises 
will be included in the cost while the principle will be paid by 
enterprises with their retained capital. 
<H5>  The Great Significance of Doing Financial Reform Well </H5>
  In light of the unified arrangements of the central 
authorities, reform of the tax system, the separate tax system, 
and reform of the profit distribution system of state 
enterprises constitute a crucial part of China's economic 
structural reform following the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee. A central leading comrade recently 
pointed out that the current financial reform is an important 
measure related to the long-term stability of the state, future 
economic development, and economic structural reform as a whole. 
It will also be the central link of the next year's five major 
reforms. 
  Liu Zhongli said there are reasons for the central leader to 
talk about financial reform from such a high plane. As the 
financial reform involves the economic interests and behavior of 
various quarters, doing a good job in this regard will help 
handle the relations of interests between various fields, create 
spacious conditions for economic reform, and promote the overall 
situation of reform. From a long-term point of view, if the 
financial reform succeeds, it will create basic conditions for 
initially establishing a socialist market economic system by the 
turn of the century, straighten out the relations of 
distribution, stop the drain on revenue, and establish a 
standard financial operational mechanism. From a short-term 
point of view, because of the big action taken in the current 
reform, there will be great changes in the taxation structure, 
organizations for levying taxes, and the method of revenue 
collection. A job well done in organization and convergence 
will directly affect the financial situation of 1994 and have a 
bearing on the economic development and successes of major 
reforms in the future. 
<H5>  Ensuring Implementation to the Letter </H5>
  Liu Zhongli pointed out that the design of the financial 
reform scheme follows the basic requirements of financial 
management for a socialist market economic system, refers to the 
successful methods and experience of the countries which 
practice a market economy, and fully takes into account China's 
reality and the transition from the old to a new system. 
Besides having a standard model as an objective, it has also 
formulated the specific steps for implementation. As the reform 
scheme is determined, Liu stressed, it must be implemented to 
the letter. First, no petty tricks should be allowed in the 
base figure. Second, in the course of implementing the reform 
measures, the basic framework of the reforms must not be 
distorted and the formation of the financial operation mechanism 
must be ensured. Third, the overall situation must be taken 
into account on the question of tax return. Fourth, it is 
necessary to establish taxation organs as early as possible, 
perfect the treasury system, and ensure the smooth introduction 
of various reform measures and attainment of desired-for results. 
<H3>  Establish a Powerful System of the Central Bank Exercising 
Regulation and Control </H3>
  In the final analysis, a market economy is a monetary 
economy. At the stage of market competition, a commodity 
producer must rapidly organize production and meet the changing 
needs of the market in light of the signal of market changes. 
Without the support of flexible funds, he can only sigh 
helplessly. 
  In light of the objective of establishing a socialist market 
economic system, Zhou Zhengqing, vice president of the People's 
Bank of China, told this reporter that this year's financial 
reform should be spread from the following. 
<H5>  Genuinely Turn the People's Bank of China into a Central Bank </H5>
  The primary task of deepening financial reform is to change 
the functions of the People's Bank and turn it genuinely into a 
central bank. In the course of establishing a socialist market 
economic system, the People's Bank, as a genuine central bank, 
has the following functions: Lead and manage the country's 
banking, scientifically formulate and implement the monetary 
policies and preserve the basic stability of the currency, 
exercise strict supervision over banking organizations, and 
maintain the safety and effective operation of the banking 
system. 
  On the division of responsibilities between the general 
headquarters of the People's Bank and its branches at all levels 
after changing its functions, Zhou Zhengqing said that the basic 
guidelines are: The headquarters will exercise the powers of 
currency issue, the volume of basic currency handled, and 
regulation of the credit scope and interest rates. The 
functions of the branches under the provincial level include 
banking supervision and management, investigation and 
statistical analyses, regulation of money supply, management of 
the treasury, cash allocation, foreign exchange management, and 
interbanking settlement. 
  In the process of changing the functions of the People's 
Bank, Zhou Zhengqing said, the following points must be 
emphasized: First, the monetary policies should be unified 
nationwide and the powers to formulate monetary policies lie in 
the headquarters. Second, it is necessary to strengthen 
supervision over the banking organizations. All countries pay 
great attention to banking supervision, which is an important 
and specific work. The supervision over banking in China is 
mainly undertaken by the People's Bank. Third, the branches at 
all levels should make good investigations and statistical 
analyses and lay a scientific basis for formulating and 
implementing monetary policies. Fourth, all the branches should 
effect a change from the stress laid on sharing the capital and 
scale in the past to exercising supervision over banking and 
conducting investigation and study. 
  Under a market economic system, Zhou Zhengqing pointed out, 
we should understand this: The contribution made by the 
branches of the central bank to the local economy lies in 
enforcing supervision according law, maintaining the banking 
order and environment of a locality, ensuring that the financial 
organizations of the locality operate steadily and effectively 
with less risks, and that they are competitive so that the 
savings depositors and investors will rest assured. In this 
way, they can attract more capital to the locality. 
<H5>  Reform of the Credit and Capital Management System </H5>
  To deepen reform of the banking system, the People's Bank 
should gradually apply the savings guarantee funds, the central 
bank's loan interest rate, and other open market operation means 
to regulate currency supply and the total amount of social 
credit in order to maintain stability of the currency. At the 
same time, it is necessary to strengthen control, regulation, 
and management of the commercial banks and to establish a 
mechanism to guard against and confine the risks in capital 
lending. 
  In light of this requirement, Zhou Zhengqing said, reform of 
the credit management system will proceed from the following 
this year: First, on the premise of keeping the total amount 
under control, explore the operational objective of applying the 
medium of currency supply, total credit, interbank lending 
interest rates, and bank guarantee fund rates. Second, 
gradually change the traditional means of the central bank 
handling the basic currency through the commercial banks, 
promote discounts and other businesses including treasury bonds 
and foreign exchange, and increase the proportion of basic 
currency handled through the channels of open market operation 
and discount. Third, exercise separate management for the 
commercial banks and policy-related capital and businesses, cut 
off the direct links between the central bank's basic currency 
supply and policy-related loans, exercise assets and liabilities 
ratio and risk management for the renminbi and foreign exchange 
credit of the commercial banks, exercise assets and liabilities 
ratio management with limited loans over those which cannot 
temporarily maintain a balance of assets and liabilities, 
strengthen the self-binding mechanism of banking organizations, 
and gradually perfect the microscopic basis of indirect 
regulation and control. 
  Regarding reform of the credit management system, Zhou 
Zhengqing insisted that the primary task is to strengthen 
control over the total amount. At the same time, it is 
necessary to encourage commercial banks to strengthen management 
over credit funds, improve the quality of credit funds, reduce 
and avoid the occurrence of risk assets, confine the 
expansionist behavior of banks through establishing a restraint 
mechanism, and offer a fine banking environment for the 
sustained, rapid, and healthy [chi xu kuai su jian kang 2170 
4958 1816 6643 0256 1660] growth of the national economy. 
<H5>  Establish and Apply Open Market Operation </H5>
  It was the U.S. Federal Reserve which first used the central 
bank to regulate and control the basic currency and regulate the 
supply of currency in the open market through the trading of 
government securities or other bills in the early 1950's. 
China's open market business started in 1993. It was the 
specific contents of the reform of the monetary policies of the 
central bank and an exploratory work which required a process of 
gradual development and perfection. The open market businesses 
offered by the central bank are aimed at regulating and 
controlling the supply of currency and total amount of social 
credit. The purchase of government treasury bonds should be 
based on the independent policy decisions of the Central Bank 
rather than offering capital accommodation channels for the 
government or seeking profits. In the years ahead, the central 
bank will make its own decision on specific operation and 
regulation and control over the basic currency through open 
market business, discount, credit loans, and foreign exchange 
trading. 
  Zhou Zhengqing pointed out that the policy decisions on 
applying open market business to handle the basic currency 
should be made by the central bank, which will determine the 
amount, means, and prices of the trading, bring it into line 
with a balance of credit, and make overall planning. At 
present, we are not yet sure what impact will the open market 
operation produce on credit, interest rates, and the financial 
market. Therefore, it is necessary to boldly conduct 
experiments, promptly sum up experience, and advance amid 
explorations. 
<H5>  Genuinely Turn the State Special Bank Into a Commercial Bank </H5>
  Genuinely turning the state special bank into a commercial 
bank constitutes an essential part of the financial reform and 
the crux of the deepening of financial reform. Zhou Zhengqing 
explained the steps of the reform: A policy bank should be set 
up first, which will separate the policy-related businesses from 
the special bank. Then the special banks will be reformed in 
light of the general principles of the commercial banks so that 
they can gradually become genuine commercial banks. 
  --Set up a policy bank, resolve the problem of China's 
special bank assuming dual responsibilities, and let the policy 
bank and commercial bank attend to their own duties. The work 
of forming the State Development Bank and the Import and Export 
Bank is now under way. Preparations for establishing the 
Chinese Agricultural Development Bank have also started. 
Following the establishment of the policy bank, its businesses 
will be guided and supervised by the People's Bank. The policy 
bank cannot be regarded as the second finance and it cannot 
unrestrictedly expand the scope and amount of policy-related 
loans. 
  --The fundamental characteristics of the state commercial 
bank are independent operation, assuming sole responsibility for 
profit and loss, undertaking risks, and self-restraint. It must 
implement the principles and policies of the party and state. 
The commercial bank cannot do whatever it likes because of the 
transformation and it should not regard speculation in shares 
and real estate as its indispensable business. As a matter of 
fact, all countries have restrictions on the scope of business 
of their commercial banks. Viewed from the reality of China's 
banking development, it is necessary to exercise separate 
operation and management over banking, securities, trust and 
investment, and insurance. The commercial bank should not be 
allowed to invest in industries or engage in stock and real 
estate speculation. 
  --Introduce a competitive mechanism. All the banks, 
Chinese-funded and foreign-funded ones, and the financial 
organizations should abide by financial laws and regulations, 
carry out competition within the scope of their businesses, and 
continuously improve their services, efficiency, and asset 
quality. 
  --When policy-related businesses are separated, it does not 
mean that the special bank has automatically become a commercial 
bank. There is a process for the transformation of a special 
bank to a state commercial bank, which depends on external 
environment, particularly the gradual establishment of a modern 
enterprise system, as well as perfection of the internal 
operation mechanism such as operation principles and internal 
management system and method. All this should be standardized 
and improved in light of the general principles of the 
commercial bank and the banking laws and regulations. 
  --China's current commercial banks, such the Communications 
Bank, China Trust Industrial Bank, Chinese Merchants Bank, and 
Shenzhen Development Bank were all established by following the 
model of a commercial bank. These banks have obtained some 
experience in recent years. 
  --In light of China's reality, we should vigorously and 
steadily develop a cooperative bank system, which includes urban 
cooperative banks and rural cooperative banks, which will mainly 
serve the medium and small-sized enterprises, the vast rural 
areas, and regional economic development. We will try out the 
establishment of the urban cooperative banks and rural 
cooperative banks based on the urban and rural credit 
cooperatives. 
  The upholding of the principle of legislation first and 
construction second is the reliable guarantee for the smooth 
success of the financial reform as well as an essential 
characteristic of the reform. Zhou Zhengqing said that the 
drafting of the "Law of the People's Bank of China," "PRC Bank 
Law," "Insurance Law," "Bills Law," and the rules, regulations, 
and methods corresponding with the reform is now under progress. 
We should ensure the healthy growth of the financial reform 
through perfecting legislation. 
<H3>  Establish an Operational Mechanism Suited to the General 
Rules of the International Economy </H3>
  As economic contacts between all countries are further 
strengthened, China's foreign trade and economic work is facing 
opportunities as well as challenges. How should we gain the 
initiative? Wu Yi, minister of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation, said that the key lies in seizing the opportunity, 
duly readjusting the policies, and further deepening reform. 
The focus should be: 
<H3>  Further Improve the Macroeconomic Regulation and Control 
Mechanism for Imports and Exports </H3>
  The State Council has called on us to apply economic means 
to 
regulate foreign trade and exercise guiding planned management 
over total volume of exports, foreign exchange earned from 
exports, and foreign exchange used in imports. The Ministry of 
Foreign Economic Trade and Cooperation [MOFTEC] should consult 
relevant departments on further improving the export tax 
reimbursement system. Commencing this year, there will be a 
gradual transition to the central finance refunding duties while 
the localities and enterprises strictly following the 
regulations, improving the management system, and ensuring 
prompt and full refund of duties. At the same time, it is 
necessary to adopt effective measures to sternly attack the 
practices of swindling the state out of tax reimbursements. The 
credit policy of encouraging export should be earnestly 
implemented. Commencing this year, the state will abolish all 
financial subsidies for imports and comprehensively introduce an 
agency system. 
<H3>  Further Lift the Restrictions on Importing and Exporting 
Commodities in an Orderly Way </H3>
  Abolish mandatory planning and lift the restrictions on most 
commodities, except a small number of very important import and 
export commodities, which are of vital importance to the 
national economy and people's livelihood, and which are 
monopolized in the international market, or which occupy a 
leading status in the international market. All this should be 
operated under unified management. The methods of bidding, 
auction, or standardized distribution will be implemented for 
the import and export commodity quotas. The bidding system also 
applies to the government commodity loans. Enterprises taking 
part in the bidding should undergo strict qualification 
examination. At the same time, it is necessary to delegate the 
powers of foreign economic operation to productive enterprises, 
scientific and technological units, and some commercial and 
material supply enterprises which have conditions, and create 
favorable conditions for them to enter the international market 
and directly participate in international competition. 
<H3>  Reorganize State Foreign Trade Enterprises in Light of the 
Modern Enterprise System </H3>
  The key to changing the operational mechanism of foreign 
trade enterprises lies in changing the ideological concepts and 
effecting a change from the executor of the state plan to export 
commodity producers; from monopolized operation and relying on 
preference given by the state policies to vigorously plunging 
into the market and seeking development in the course of 
competition on equal footing; integrating trade with industry, 
agriculture, technology, and commerce; introducing an agent 
system; taking the road of industrialization and 
internationalization and forming groups; and encouraging foreign 
economic and trade enterprises with conditions to gradually 
advance in the direction of forming comprehensive consortia. 
Meanwhile, the large productive enterprise groups and 
foreign-funded enterprises should gradually become industry- 
agriculture-technology-trade transnational companies. It is 
necessary to establish and improve a strict system of personal 
responsibility, financial accounting and supervisory mechanism, 
and ideological and political work guarantee system and 
genuinely establish a self-restraint mechanism which carries out 
independent operation, assumes sole responsibility for profits 
and losses, and seeks further development. 
<H5>  Maintain Unification of Foreign Economic and Trade Policies </H5>
  It is the objective demand of a national unified big market, 
as well as one of the standards of international trade, to 
implement a unified foreign trade system and policies 
nationwide. We must ensure unity of China's foreign economy and 
trade system, exercise unified management over foreign economy 
and trade, and undertake the international commitments in a 
unified way so as to establish and maintain the state's image. 
In light of international standards and China's commitments, 
only the openly promulgated laws, regulations, and policies will 
be implemented. 
<H3>  Strengthen and Improve Macroeconomic Coordination and 
Management </H3>
  Lifting restrictions on operation does not mean letting 
things drift and independent operation does not mean free 
operation without any restraints. In cooperation with the 
customs, commercial inspection, and industrial and commercial 
management departments, we should comprehensively tackle the 
operation order. It is necessary to formulate a set of feasible 
methods for strengthening overall management and focus attention 
on the major commodities and markets. In this regard, the role 
of the import and export chambers must be strengthened. 
<H3>  Turn State Planning From Direct to Indirect Regulation and 
Control </H3>
  In the world today there is no market economy which is not 
intervened and controlled by the government. Some countries 
have been more successful than us in certain fields. While 
summing up the experience of Southeast Asian countries where the 
economy developed at a fast pace, experts of the world bank drew 
three points, of which the second one was macroeconomic 
stability. Our practice has also proved that without forceful 
and effective macroeconomic control and regulation, a stable 
economic environment will be out of the question and there can 
be no sustained, rapid, and healthy growth of the economy. To 
catch up with the economically developed nations within a short 
period and establish a socialist market economic system, Chen 
Jinhua said, China must make efforts in two aspects: Give full 
play to the role of the market mechanism and strengthen and 
improve macroeconomic control and regulation. Regarding state 
planning, it refers to: 
<H5>  The Core Is To Change the Functions of Planning </H5>
  Regarding state planning, which is an essential means of 
macroeconomic control and regulation, what are its nature, 
functions, scope, and role under the conditions of a socialist 
market economy? 
  Chen Jinhua stressed the necessity of rationally determining 
the strategy for national economic and social development, 
macroeconomic regulation and control targets, and industrial 
policies; doing a good job of economic forecasting; and working 
out plans for major economic structure, distribution of 
productive forces, improvement of land resources, and major 
construction. While planning work, it is necessary to lay 
stress on macroeconomy, strategy, and policies, with the focus 
on mid and long-term planning, and to comprehensively apply the 
macroeconomic policies and economic levers of the 
municipalities. This is also the direction and tasks of 
expediting the reform of the planning system and changing the 
functions of planning. 
  In light of this requirement, Chen Jinhua said, the first 
task of strengthening and improving macroeconomic regulation and 
control this year is to ensure the attainment of the objective 
and tasks of macroeconomic regulation and control set in state 
planning. All localities and departments should accept the 
guidance of the state's macroeconomic regulation and control and 
maintain its authority. Second, the stress of macroeconomic 
regulation and control should be put on maintaining a balance of 
the economy and optimizing the economic structure. It is 
necessary to fully tap the potentials of resources, attain high 
economic growth through planning, strictly control excessive 
growth in investment in fixed assets and the excessive growth of 
consumption, effectively check soaring prices, and bring 
inflation under control. Third, in light of industrial 
policies, it is necessary to rationally readjust the production 
setup, investment setup, and international industrial structure; 
upgrade products; and promote trade between regions and the 
coordinated development of the tertiary, primary, and secondary 
industries. Fourth, closely monitor and forecast economic 
trends, strengthen supervision over economic operations, make 
advanced studies of the problems which might occur in economic 
life, and make counterproposals. Fifth, give full play to the 
functions of planning in coordinating macroeconomic policies. 
The planning departments should take the initiative to contact, 
consult, and cooperate with the financial, taxation, banking, 
foreign exchange management, labor and wages, and other 
departments specifically responsible for economic work, and go 
all out to increase the unity, promptness, scientific nature, 
and effectiveness of the state's macroeconomic regulation and 
control. 
<H5>  Establish an Investment Risk Responsibility Mechanism </H5>
  On maintaining sustained and rapid growth, Chen Jinhua said, 
the scope of investment arranged for this year is large enough. 
But it still cannot meet the investment of various fields. He 
said the solution is to further readjust the investment setup in 
light of the requirements of industrial policies, strictly 
within the scope of control over the total investment, and 
further strengthen key construction projects. It means 
increasing investment in the infrastructure, basic industries, 
and mainstay industries, particularly the exploitation of 
resources in the central and western regions and other projects 
badly needed by the state. It is also necessary to strictly 
control the general and technically backward processing 
industries and avoid the practices of blind construction and 
production of inferior projects. 
  First, Chen Jinhua clearly pointed out, this year's 
investment will be focused on the projects nearing completion 
and those under construction, particularly a number of major 
projects which have a bearing on the overall situation. The 
projects include the Beijing-Kowloon Railway, Lanzhou-Urumqi 
Railway, and Nanning-Kunming Railway; the Qinhuangdao, Dalian, 
and Shanghai port projects; the Beijing-Shenyang-Harbin, 
Beijing-Wuhan-Guangzhou, and Xining- Lanzhou-Urumqi optical 
fiber lines; the large coal mines in Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and 
Shaanxi; the 9.42 million kw large power project in Baoding; the 
third steelworks of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation; the 
Dashan iron mine in Shandong; the Daxing copper mine; the 
Jinzhou nonferrous metal company; the 300,000 tonne ethylene 
projects in Maomin and Jilin, and other important raw material 
projects. It is necessary to step up construction of the first 
and second automobile factories, the 908 electronic project, and 
applied satellites and continue to pay attention to the 
preparatory work of the Three Gorges project and the third phase 
of the Baoshan Iron and Steel Complex. 
  According to Chen Jinhua, Premier Li Peng pointed out at an 
economic work conference that the following three principles 
should be upheld in the newly developed projects in the future: 
First, no investment without capital should be allowed. New 
construction projects may apply for loans from the banks only 
when they have a certain proportion of capital. Second, banks 
should exercise supervision and not allow misappropriation of 
funds to make investment. Third, new projects must have enough 
working capital and construction of these projects must not be 
allowed without working capital. These principles must be 
earnestly implemented in this year's plan and the purpose of 
doing so is to vigorously increase the efficiency of investment. 
  To maintain a reasonable scope of investment, optimize the 
investment setup, and increase the efficiency of investment, 
Chen Jinhua said the fundamental thing is to reform the 
irrational investment system and establish a risk responsibility 
system for corporate investment and bank credit. Chen said that 
different capital accommodation means should be adopted in 
different fields of investment so that enterprises can gradually 
become the principal part of investment. It is necessary to 
rationally divide the scope and responsibility of the 
governments at various levels over infrastructure building and 
welfare undertakings, give full play to the role of the state 
development bank, fully arouse the enthusiasm of central and 
local enterprises, and adopt the means of joint investment or 
shareholding to guide localities and enterprises to pour funds 
into infrastructure building and basic industries. We should 
gradually develop an investment service system and perfect the 
investment information feedback system, establish and improve 
the application and registration system for the new construction 
projects, and strengthen macroeconomic guidance, regulation, and 
control over the total amount of investment as well as the 
investment setup. 
<H3>  The Objective and Tasks of Macroeconomic Regulation and 
Control </H3>
  Viewed from the situation of this year's reform and 
development, an important task for economic planning is to 
deepen enterprise reform, invigorate the large and medium-sized 
state enterprises, and create a favorable external environment. 
In other words, Chen Jinhua said, we should try to maintain an 
overall balance of social general demand and supply; provide 
enterprises with normal macroscopic links for production and 
operation; ensure the enterprises' decisionmaking rights of 
planning, investment, prices, wages, and import and exports; 
create the necessary conditions for enterprises to enter the 
market and carry out competition on equal footing; encourage 
enterprises to focus their attention on developing domestic and 
international markets; guide enterprises to readjust their 
product mix in light of market needs; and rationally apply the 
state's financial and material resources, which include central 
financial funds, bank credit, special construction funds, 
foreign loans, and state reserves to support the reform and 
development of large and medium-sized state enterprises. It is 
also necessary to alleviate the burden of enterprises by 
opposing and checking the indiscriminate mustering of funds and 
exaction of charges. 
  In overall economic balance, it is necessary to increase 
supply and narrow the gap between supply and demand. In the 
"bottleneck" industries and enterprises, such as railways and 
communications, which have tempered the rapid economic growth, 
it is particularly necessary to tap the potentials through 
technical transformation of the existing enterprises, strengthen 
their management, and create conditions for rapid economic 
growth. 
  To attain the objective of macroeconomic regulation and 
control in 1994, Chen Jinhua insisted on the importance of 
grasping the following points: Vigorously promote the 
sustained, rapid, and healthy growth of the national economy; 
concentrate forces to push forward the major reforms in various 
fields; put the focus of accelerated growth on optimizing the 
economic setup and increasing efficiency; and strive to bring 
about a coordinated economic and social development. 
<H5>  Take Comprehensive Coordination As One's Tasks </H5>
  The practice of reform over the years has proved that 
creating a spacious environment is the prerequisite for 
accelerating reform and development. In 1994, when both reform 
and development must be accelerated, what should be the focus of 
work for the State Economic and Trade Commission, which is 
responsible for comprehensively coordinating economic operation? 
To apply various means to comprehensively coordinate the 
economic operation, Wang Zhongyu said we should focus on 
prevention and prompt macro and microscopic regulation and 
control so as to avoid accumulation of problems and passivity. 
It is necessary to keep abreast of the economic development 
trend, regularly monitor, forecast, predict, and analyze the new 
problems cropping up in economic operation, propose reform 
measures and countermeasures, and offer grounds for the CPC 
Central Committee and State Council to scientifically make 
decisions. In light of this requirement, we should do the 
following well: 
<H3>  Put Reform and Coordination of State Enterprises in First 
Place </H3>
  The only way to invigorate state enterprises is through 
deepened reform. Centered on reform of state enterprises, Wang 
Zhongyu said the economic and trade commissions at all levels 
should do the following work well: 
  First, vigorously establish a modern enterprise system. In 
light of the requirements of the State Council, they should join 
the relevant departments in seriously organizing 100 large and 
medium-sized enterprises to undergo the experiment of the modern 
enterprise system. After selecting the enterprises to undergo 
the experiment, specific measures and practical operation should 
be worked out as soon as possible. 
  Second, continue to implement the "Regulations for 
Enterprises to Effect a Change of Operational Mechanism," step 
up formulation of rules to coordinate the "Regulations," 
strengthen supervision over implementation of the "Regulations," 
and ensure that the decisionmaking powers and responsibilities 
of enterprises are delegated. They should earnestly implement 
the "Regulations for Exercising Supervision over State Assets," 
which is to be promulgated soon, work out specific measures for 
implementation, do well the experiments of assets operation 
responsibility system and assigning members of the supervisory 
board, vigorously explore rational means and ways for operation 
and management of state assets, and preserve and increase the 
value of state assets. 
  Third, accelerate the pace of structural readjustment of 
enterprise organizations and improve the enterprise internal 
mechanism. In light of the "Bankruptcy Law," enterprises which 
have suffered losses for years, which are incapable of turning 
their deficits into profits, and which cannot repay the debts 
with their assets, should go bankrupt. Only the best should be 
allowed to survive. In accordance with the requirements of a 
modern enterprise system, they should develop a number of large 
enterprise groups transcending regions and trades, based on the 
predominance of public ownership and which combine their 
property rights. At the same time, they should effect a 
transition from enterprise contract responsibility system to 
income tax system and speed up the reform of enterprise labor, 
personnel, distribution, and social insurance systems. 
  Fourth, strengthen enterprise operation and management in 
light of market economic needs. The loose and poor management 
within a considerable number of enterprises merit attention. It 
is necessary to focus attention on basic, quality, cost, and 
safety management; establish and improve the enterprise 
management system; and increase market adaptability and 
competitiveness. A drive of "changing mechanism, grasping 
internal management, and increasing efficiency" should be 
launched this year. 
  Fifth, adopt feasible measures to alleviate the unreasonable 
debt burden of enterprises. For example, the part of allocation 
can be changed to loans and the balance be turned to state 
capital for the enterprises which meet the state's industrial 
policies and which badly need support. Regarding enterprises 
which have a future but whose current economic efficiency is 
poor and are incapable of repaying the due loans, they may 
postpone the payment, with the approval of the banks. 
Enterprises with a bad debt must undergo strict auditing. With 
the approval of the banks, the bad debt may be canceled from the 
bad debt guarantee funds. Specific proposals should be made by 
relevant departments through the experiments. 
  Sixth, complement enterprise work funds through various 
channels. The large and medium-sized state enterprises should 
complement their working capital through various channels. 
Regarding enterprises which have not delivered after-tax 
profits recently, it is necessary to draw 50 percent from their 
profit retention to supplement the production and operation 
funds. Preferential treatment in credit should be given to the 
efficient large and medium-sized state enterprises. Without 
sufficient working capital, construction of the new projects 
involving investment in fixed assets must not be approved. 
  Seventh, implement the "ten thousand, thousand, hundred, 
and ten" plan for changing operational mechanisms. It is 
necessary to delegate the 14 kinds of decisionmaking powers to 
the 10,000 large and medium-sized state enterprises and complete 
the work of reappraising the stocks and assets of enterprises. 
Through assigning supervisory board members, it is necessary to 
exercise supervision of the state assets of 1,000 backbone 
enterprises which are of vital importance to the national 
economy and people's livelihood. Select 100 different types of 
large and medium-sized state enterprises to implement the 
"Regulations" and undergo the experiment of a modern enterprise 
system. Conduct the experiment of alleviating the unreasonable 
burden of enterprises and increasing the proportion of 
enterprise working capital in 10 cities or regions and propose 
specific solutions to the matter step-by-step. 
<H5>  Accelerate the Pace of Enterprise Technological Progress </H5>
  Wang Zhongyu said that the requirements of this year's 
technological development and technical transformation are: A 
high starting point, giving prominence to structural 
optimization and energy conservation, and advancing toward the 
goal of rationalization of technical equipment, sophisticated 
techniques, and a higher grade for new products. Focused on 
this objective, it is necessary to give prominence to key points 
in this year's technical transformation plan, select a number of 
key projects to undergo technical transformation, upgrade the 
key enterprises and trades, and give further play to the 
advantages of the regions. In light of the requirements of 
industrial and structural readjustment, we should continue to 
increase capital investment in transportation and 
communications, energy industry, raw materials industry, and 
technical transformation of old industrial bases. 
  We should further import advanced technology and apply the 
technological achievements in productive forces. In the next 
two years, assistance should be given to 100 large enterprise 
(holdings) to establish technological centers, carry out 100 
state-level major technological development and industrial 
experimental projects, organize 100 major technological 
popularization demonstration centers, and develop 10 high-tech 
industrialization research projects. It is necessary to 
vigorously develop new products, promote lateral development of 
industrial research, and encourage the use of high-tech to 
transform the traditional industries. In light of the 
possibility and their needs, enterprises should establish and 
improve various forms of technological development 
organizations. We should offer technological information to 
enterprises and nurture the technological market. 
<H5>  Establish and Improve the Market System </H5>
  Establishing and improving the market system is not only the 
foundation for the attainment of macroeconomic regulation and 
control but also the prerequisite for enterprises to head for 
the market and optimize the distribution of resources. 
  Wang Zhongyu pointed out: The economic and trade commissions 
which regard coordination as their task should, first, take 
active part in the formulation of the scheme for building the 
market for essential production factors and do well 
comprehensive coordination work for developing intermediary 
service organizations and giving full play to their role of 
service, contacts, notary, and supervision. Second, study and 
work out policy measures for promoting the development of 
various commodity markets, give priority to the establishment 
and improvement of the market for big batch of farm and sideline 
produce and means of production, and boost the development of 
various commodity markets. Third, take the readjustment of the 
product mix as the focus of industrial and communications 
production, vigorously study and develop two kinds of markets, 
namely, the international market and the rural market, and 
develop the urban market. In short, we should cater to the 
market and organize production in light of market needs. 
Enterprises should be encouraged to earn more foreign exchange 
through exports. 
<H5>  Strengthen Economic Management in Light of Law </H5>
  In a sense, a market economy is a legal economy. Hence, it 
is necessary to attach great importance to and strengthen 
economic legislation work. Focused on enterprise reform and 
market building, Wang Zhongyu said, we should study and step up 
formulation of economic regulations for standardizing the 
market, regulating the relations of market transactions, 
maintaining market order, strengthening macroeconomic regulation 
and control, and improving the economic environment so as to 
ensure the organic combination and simultaneous development of 
economic legislation, structural reform, and economic growth. 
It is necessary to vigorously explore effective means of 
applying legal means to comprehensively coordinate economic 
operation in the new situation.

<F P=106> [By staff reporters: "Macro-Control To Be Continued, </F>
Coastal Areas React Flexibly, but Interior Provinces Are Laden 
With Anxieties"] 
  [Text] Local officials in different areas reacted in 
different ways to the State Council's recent circular on further 
exercising "macro-control" over capital investment. Some local 
officials told reporters that the tightened control would result 
in stopping some new investment projects in the northern 
provinces. However, some officials in Guangdong said they were 
not worried about this because they had certain countermeasures. 
They also assured foreign investors that the newly signed 
investment agreements would not be affected. 
  A senior official in a Guangdong city said: In the past more 
than 10 years of reform and opening, Guangdong officials have 
developed a good ability to cope with policy changes. "When 
reading the documents, you do not need to worry too much, and 
should continue to invite external investment and to carry 
forward existing projects. Then things will not become too 
complicated." He smiled: "A good cat is one able to catch mice, 
and it does not matter whether it is a white cat or a black cat." 
  The official did not think that the recent "macro-control" 
action taken by the central authorities would affect Guangdong's 
high-speed growth and the large number of ongoing construction 
projects. 
  He cited some examples, saying that Guangzhou's subway 
project would require a total investment of some 5 billion yuan, 
and the second phase of Guangzhou's Zhujiang power plant will 
require an investment of more than 1 billion yuan. The funds 
contributed by the Chinese partners in these projects will be 
guaranteed, and the local authorities have their own methods of 
raising the funds. 
  One of the methods is to tap the city's land resources to 
raise funds for urban construction. For example, the Guangzhou 
authorities will sell the right to develop the property above 
more than 10 subway stations, which will raise over 1 billion 
yuan in funds. 
  In contrast with the flexible reactions of the coastal 
provinces, the situation in the interior provinces was totally 
different. An official in Hunan Province said: In the second 
half of last year, some cities and counties in Hunan set up 
development zones on their own, and more than 100 such 
development zones now have been closed. At present, there are 
only three state-level development zones and more than 100 
development zones approved by provincial or city authorities. 
This time, after the central authorities again issued the 
instruction on exercising "macro-control," the development zones 
will be screened again, one by one. It is very likely that a 
large part of the existing development zones will be closed, as 
they cannot obtain any funds from the state and do not enjoy any 
favorable policies. 
  An official in the Jiangsu city of Zhangjiagang said that in 
the new round of retrenchment, some investment projects the city 
recently had begun might be affected and have to be suspended 
for a certain period.

<F P=106> [By Wang Bingqian, vice chairman of the National People's </F>
Congress Standing Committee: "Make a Thorough Study of the 
Position and Functions of Finance in the Market Economy 
System"--excerpt of speech at the 1993 annual meeting of China's 
Society of Finance and the 11th National Symposium on Financial 
Theory] 
  [Text] The 14th National Party Congress and the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee definitely 
pointed out: The aim of establishing a socialist market economic 
structure is to make the market play a basic role in the 
allocation of resources under the state macroeconomic regulation 
and control. Everybody knows that, as an action of 
distribution by the government, finance itself is an activity of 
resource allocation as well as a means of macroeconomic 
regulation and control. Under the planned economic 
structure in the past, allocation of resources was realized by 
taking planning as a foundation and the activities of 
departments including finance, material supplies, and others. 
How then under the conditions of a market economy following the 
gradual change from the planned economy to the socialist market 
economy, will finance play its role in the allocation of 
resources and how will finance exercise regulation and control 
at the macro level of the state? This is an important 
theoretical and practical issue at present. 
  The decisions adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee pointed out that "there must be a 
sound macroeconomic regulation and control system for the 
socialist market economy," proposed that "a coordinating and 
restraining mechanism between planning and monetary and 
financial policy should be established and comprehensive 
coordination in economic operations enhanced," and stated that 
"finance should use the instruments of budget and taxation to 
concentrate on regulating the economic structure and social 
distribution, use monetary and financial policies to regulate 
the basic equilibrium of total social demand and supply, and, in 
coordination with industrial policies, bring about a coordinated 
national economic and social development." The above expression 
is very clear, that is, finance shoulders the task of 
regulating the economic structure and social distribution and of 
regulating and controlling total demand and supply. 
  Taken from the formation of money, the allocation of 
market resources is, in essence, a kind of distribution and 
circulation of financial resources. Markets play a basic 
role in the allocation of resources, but they cannot cover 
everything. The problems that markets are unable to or 
cannot very well resolve in the allocation of resources must be 
settled through financial distribution and other economic means 
to ensure coordinated social development. For instance, 
the resources allocated to satisfy public requirements, 
including the portion of resources necessary for government 
organs to maintain normal operations and institutions to provide 
public services, can only be allocated through government 
financial distribution rather than through markets. This is not 
substitutable. However, economic development is always a 
fundamental mission of a socialist state. Although the 
allocation of resources under the conditions of a market economy 
takes markets as a foundation, because there are weaknesses in 
markets themselves, not only must investment in the 
construction of infrastructural facilities and social welfare be 
made by state finance through overall planning, but the economic 
structure and social distribution must also be regulated through 
the financial means of budget and taxation. Therefore, how to 
adjust the structure of financial revenue and expenditure and 
the policy of financial distribution to suit the needs of market 
economic development is a subject that we should study with 
concentrated efforts. For example--how should we 
rationally regulate the structure of distributing financial 
resources, and properly handle and regulate in a timely manner 
the extent of concentrating and distributing financial resources 
as well as the departmental and regional structures of 
distributing financial resources, according to the requirement 
that markets should play a basic role in the allocation of 
resources? Again, there are other examples--in the areas of 
financial taxation structure and distribution policies, how 
should we ensure the ability of the central authorities to 
appropriately concentrate financial resources and enhance its 
ability in macroeconomic regulation and control under the 
conditions of the market economy; and how should we correctly 
handle the distribution relationships between the state, 
enterprises, and individuals according to the principle of 
giving priority to efficiency while taking account of fairness? 
All these should be studied in theory, and experience pertinent 
to them should be repeatedly summarized in practice. 
  Certainly, the position and task of finance in the 
establishment of a socialist market economic structure are not 
limited to the above content. The five major links in the basic 
framework of the socialist market economic structure sketched in 
the "Decisions" are an organically integrated entirety, which 
has set new tasks and demands for financial work. Other parts 
of the "Decisions," including in-depth structural reforms in the 
rural economy, foreign economic relations, science, technology, 
and education, the intensified building of the legal system, and 
so on, have set new tasks and demands for financial work as 
well. All these also call for us to conduct studies in theory 
and practice. 
  Great and spectacular achievements have been scored in 
China's reform and opening up. In the entire historical 
development process, financial taxation reform is always placed 
in an important position. It not only facilitates the 
development of the reform and opening up undertaking with 
financial and material capabilities, but also coordinates and 
promotes other economic structural reforms on its own. The 
reform of financial taxation before the 14th National Party 
Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee was chiefly aimed at eliminating the malpractices of 
the old structure and at changing the conditions of highly 
concentrated financial resources and financial powers. Now, the 
aim is to readjust the distribution structure of financial 
resources, provide necessary financial resources and powers to 
enterprises for becoming the main body of the market economy, 
and provide financial resources to localities for accelerating 
economic development and the rapid growth of the economy as a 
whole, in accordance with the development track from the planned 
economy to the planned commodity economy and finally to the 
market economy. In short, it aims at realizing the 
objective of laying a foundation of financial resources for 
markets to play the basic role in the allocation of resources 
and at correspondingly carrying out reforms of some financial 
management systems that do not suit the requirements of reform 
and opening up, through the readjustment of the distribution 
structure of financial resources. At present, in line with 
the decisions of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee, positively accelerating reform in financial 
taxation has been taken as a major aim in the establishment of a 
socialist market economic structure, and the introduction of 
three reform programs on financial taxation in 1994 has been 
planned. Today, China's reform of financial taxation has 
entered a new stage. The characteristics of this stage are to 
straighten out the relationship of financial taxation, 
standardize its conduct, and establish a financial taxation 
structure and operational mechanism that are suited to the 
socialist market economy. This is a significant change calling 
for us to transform our concept on financial resource 
management, improve our management modes and methods, and 
gradually form a set of financial taxation and policy 
theoretical systems suitable to the socialist market economic 
structure. This is a mission entrusted by the times to our 
financial theoretical and practical workers. 
  In order to be suited to the requirements of this 
development, it is necessary to once again stress the importance 
of financial theoretical study. Just as Engels put it: Only 
when people stand on the theoretical height can they take a 
broad and long-term view to charter the right course and take 
the initiative in work. It can be said that leadership work 
cannot be well performed if serious attention is not paid to 
theoretical study and scientific research, and that 
one-sidedness and blindness in work is unavoidable and 
opportunities are apt to be bungled if theory and scientific 
research are ignored. Hence, we must take theoretical 
study of finance very seriously, consider some strategic, 
overall, and long-term issues earnestly, and give impetus to 
initiating a new situation in financial work with infiltrating 
studies of scientific theories and policies. Reform of 
financial taxation will enter a crucial year in 1994. Although 
the reform plan has been set, there are still many problems to 
be solved and many new conditions to be studied in practical 
work. This calls for comrades in business and scientific 
research departments to coordinate with one another and strive 
to enhance the theoretical level of the entire rank of cadres on 
the financial taxation front and their ability to solve 
practical problems, through intensified investigation and 
research and the conscientious study of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.

<F P=106> ["Special feature" by Jiang Yuan (3068 6678)] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong, 1 Feb (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--The craze 
for large-scale business-canvassing activities launched by 
various local authorities from the mainland in Hong Kong will be 
markedly scaled down this year. 
  According to information from a relevant quarter, a relevant 
department under the State Council has issued instruction to 
various localities since the second half of last year, 
stipulating that from then on when provinces, autonomous 
regions, and municipalities stage business-canvassing activities 
in Hong Kong and overseas, they must submit their plans to the 
relevant State Council department for examination and approval; 
as for counties, cities (county-level cities), and first-grade 
enterprises directly under the central authorities wanting to 
stage business-canvassing activities in Hong Kong and overseas, 
their applications will be scrutinized more stringently, and 
they must submit applications not only to the next higher 
government for examination and approval, but also to the 
relevant State Council department for approval. The instruction 
also stressed that various kinds of business-canvassing 
activities must attach importance to practical results. 
  At the same time, apart from strictly restricting various 
localities from staging business-canvassing activities outside 
the country and borders, the relevant State Council department 
also instructed that regarding various kinds of 
business-canvassing activities organized by the localities, and 
various kinds of festive activities "staged in the name of 
culture, but turned out to be economic and trade operas," 
regulation and control will be strengthened, and centralized 
arrangements will be made. 
  According to information, the reason for the Chinese 
Government to make up its mind to exercise strict control over 
various localities wanting to stage business-canvassing 
activities outside the country and border is because many 
negative effects caused by the excess business-canvassing 
activities in the past have already gradually surfaced. Among 
the effects are: 
  First, too much "untrue foreign capital." 
  Many investment projects which are made in the name of 
foreign firms or foreign sources, are in fact made by mainland 
organizations (mainly state-run organizations) which transfer 
their funds overseas and then back home with a new name, and the 
purpose is to evade taxes and to enjoy the preferential policy 
in the areas of taxes and import and export of quotas for 
foreign-funded enterprises. Such moves not only cause losses in 
government revenue, but also bring about great chaos to various 
economic domains and links. 
  Second, the proportion of foreign capital being made really 
available is extremely low. 
  The excess business-canvassing activities have created an 
unhealthy practice of being "false, big, and empty," and led to 
a situation in which the unfulfilled letters of intent and 
agreements on huge amounts of investment fly in the sky 
everywhere. A certain big province in the north said at the end 
of last year that it had attracted $6 billion of foreign funds, 
but in reality less than $100 million of the foreign funds was 
really made available. 
  Third, astonishing waste and extravagance. 
  Over the past one or two years, business-canvassing 
activities staged outside the country (border), especially in 
Hong Kong by various localities, have involved larger and larger 
delegations and increasingly extravagant layouts, while some 
people have used the business-canvassing activities as excuses 
to travel on public funds, to the serious extent of practicing 
fraud and putting the cart before the horse. In order to cover 
up the economic "hole" which involved a large amount of money, 
they could only report false results in the business-canvassing 
activities. 
  In light of this situation, and in order to check corrupt 
practices in economic activities, the State Council has promptly 
sent a strongly worded "red-letterhead document" to various 
localities in the whole country, strictly controlling those who 
want to stage business-canvassing activities in Hong Kong and 
overseas, and saying that violations of the regulations will be 
looked into according to law and discipline.

<F P=106> [Article by Wang Hui-hsin (3769 1979 7451): "To Prevent the </F>
Bubble Economy From Causing Drastic Price Rises, Beijing 
Tightens Credits To Cool Down Overheated Real Estate Market"] 
  [Text] Despite the move to rectify the bubble economy 
during July and December last year, the real estate investment 
in mainland China has tended to become overheated again since 
last November. Recently, the CPC Central Committee determinedly 
adopted "cool down" measures with a view to slowing the pace of 
real estate development, reducing fixed-asset investment, and 
easing inflationary pressures. The State Council issued a 
"red-letterhead document" at the end of last January, ordering 
all localities to maintain effective control over real estate 
investment, and to standardize and guide foreign investment in 
China's real estate market. In addition to halting the 
construction of "two courses" (racecourses and golf courses), 
many projects for the construction of high-priced Western-style 
houses, office buildings, and villas also have been suspended or 
canceled. 
<H3>  The Red-Letterhead Document Orders Rectification of the Real 
Estate Market </H3>
  Hong Kong investors are the "catalyst" to the mainland's 
real 
estate craze, and their investment has involved over 100 million 
square meters of real estate. Therefore, this new upsurge of 
macroeconomic control and regulation will have a considerable 
impact on Hong Kong businessmen who invest in real estate and on 
Hong Kong people who have brought residential housing on the 
mainland. 
  Under the heading "Circular on Continuously Strengthening 
Macroeconomic Control and Regulation of Fixed-Asset Investment," 
the red-letterhead document calls for efforts, in the present 
situation marked by "overheated growth in investment and an 
unduly large scale of construction," to bring the country's 
fixed-asset investment (including commodity housing) into accord 
with the government plan. 
  According to the red-letterhead document, a reduction in 
real 
estate investment and financing is the key task for the new 
upsurge of macroeconomic control and regulation. All investment 
and financing concerning real estate development and 
foreign-related economic development zones will be brought under 
the planning and control of the State Council and local 
governments, and projects that are not listed in the state plan 
cannot obtain bank financing. The Beijing authorities still 
welcome foreign businessmen to invest in China's real estate 
market, but the investment should be oriented toward the 
ordinary residential housing urgently needed by common urban 
dwellers. In another word, they should act in coordination with 
the housing reform on the mainland, and should build more 
commodity units that ordinary mainland residents can afford, not 
high-priced Western-style houses, villas, and holiday resorts; 
still less should they build racecourses or golf courses. 
  Before the red-letterhead document was relayed to the lower 
levels, RENMIN RIBAO, the official newspaper of the CPC Central 
Committee, carried a commentator's article entitled "Preventing 
Blind Development in the Real Estate Industry." It noted: "At 
present, the scale of basic construction remains considerably 
great. Some localities, departments, and units have failed to 
act according to relevant state regulations; some exceed their 
examination and approval authority, while others act in their 
own way and start new projects blindly. As a result, the real 
estate market is tending to become overheated again, and the 
situation is extremely unfavorable to our efforts to promote 
national economic development and to check inflation." 
  One can easily see from the official CPC newspaper and the 
red-letterhead document that failure to check the real estate 
craze will lead to the same "grim economic situation" as in the 
first half of last year. Although initial results were achieved 
in rectifying the bubble economy and in checking speculation in 
the stock, foreign exchange, and real estate markets during July 
and October last year, the scale of fixed-asset investment still 
remains unduly large, and 13 and 19.5 percent increases, 
respectively, have been registered in the general level of 
retail prices and in the retail commodity price index in 35 
large and medium-sized cities. The drastic rises in commodity 
prices inevitably will lead to resentment on the part of the 
public, and are therefore unfavorable to maintaining social 
stability. This serves as one of the major reasons why the CPC 
is reemploying the "cool down" to check the real estate craze. 
<H3>  The Cool Down Treatment Can Result in Optimizing the 
Structure </H3>
  Optimization of structure is another aim of the "cool down." 
  The so-called optimization of structure has a two-fold 
definition: One is the "capital preference" in terms of 
investment, and the other is the "supply readjustment 
preference" within the real estate industry. The former refers 
to the investment (including that made by Hong Kong and foreign 
businessmen) in such basic industries as energy, communications, 
transport, telecommunications, and agriculture. By so doing, we 
can put an end to the present "bottleneck" situation, inject 
more funds into technology-intensive and capital-intensive 
industries, optimize the industrial structure of the national 
economy as a whole, and prevent the bubble economy from exerting 
adverse impact on social life. 
<H3>  Commodity Prices Are Soaring, and the Gap Between the Rich 
and the Poor Has Become Graphic </H3>
  The "cool down" of real estate investment also is aimed at 
maintaining social stability. 
  The excessive expansion of the real estate industry will 
cause drastic rises in the prices of building materials, which 
are already in short supply. Moreover, the supply capability of 
communications, transport, and energy will be weakened; as a 
result, they will fail to concentrate on the country's key 
construction project, raise the prices and charges for 
commodities and services, and bring about greater inflationary 
pressure. Tightening control over real estate investment and 
bank financing can help deter the further growth of commodity 
prices. This is a component part of our efforts to maintain 
social stability. 
  Another aim of the "cool down" is to prevent the gap between 
the rich and the poor from becoming too wide. Businessmen from 
Hong Kong, Taiwan, and foreign countries take possession of some 
land; on it they build Western-style villas and high-priced 
holiday resorts and houses for "rich households" on the 
mainland, thus giving rise to "luxury housing districts." 
However, most of the residents in these areas are still 
"difficult households" or "packed households." The "difference" 
between the luxurious and dilapidated houses of two social 
stratums have made the gap between the rich and the poor too 
"graphic," a fact that poor households cannot accept easily. In 
addition, the excessive supply of high-grade residential housing 
is also a waste of our resources. Therefore, applying a 
appropriate brake is not only necessary, but is favorable to 
maintaining social stability. 
  Since the Beijing authorities first used "the experience of 
Hong Kong" for reference in reforming its land system and put 
into trial practice the system of "separating two powers" in the 
mid 1980's, experiments have been made with sales of land use 
rights in Shanghai and Shenzhen, and large areas of land have 
been leased or sold in all parts of the country. As a result, 
the country has attained rapid growth in its real estate 
industry, the scale of investment is expanding constantly, and 
Hong Kong and foreign businessmen have become more involved in 
real estate development on the mainland. 
  The Ministry of Construction under the State Council has 
revealed the annual growth rate of real estate investment during 
the "period of above-norm development" of the 1990's: 
  The investment amount in 1991 totalled 31.6 billion yuan, up 
by 32 percent over the previous year. 
  The total investment amount reached 90 billion yuan in 1992, 
registering an increase of about 170 percent. 
  The estimated investment amount exceeded 100 billion yuan in 
1993, with a growth rate of about 13 percent. 
  The unduly rapid growth in real estate investment has put 
tremendous pressure on bank financing, building materials, and 
commodity prices, thus giving rise to a situation wherein demand 
exceeds supply. Under such circumstances, the "cool down" can 
help bring about "healthy development" in the real estate 
industry. 
  At present, the Beijing authorities have tightened bank 
financing and have ordered the abandonment of a large number of 
construction projects. This move will not only drive many 
small-scale Hong Kong real estate developers into a tight 
corner, but also will subject those who want to gain profits 
from their property mainland investment to the effects of a 
stagnant market and land devaluation, and force them to face a 
series of problems that cannot be solved easily.

  [Text] Hefei, February 7 (XINHUA) -- Farmers in east 
China's Anhui Province are paying more attention to nourishing 
food with the improvement of their livelihoods, according to a 
provincial survey team. 
  Instead of eating sweet potatoes, a high-yield, low-value 
crop, all the year round, farmers now take rice and wheat flour 
as their staple food. Per capita consumption of rice and wheat 
reached 284 kg in 1992. 
  According to statistics, farmers' annual consumption of 
meat, 
eggs and milk has gone up from 7.3 kg to 13 kg per capita and 
edible oil from 2.5 kg to 5.9 kg per capita between 1978 and 
1992. 
  In addition, farmers spend more on cigarettes, liquor, sugar 
and tea.

  [Text] Fuzhou, February 5 (CNS)--The Fujian authorities 
recently staged a campaign cracking down on the trafficking and 
smuggling of the state-protected rare species of animals and 
their parts, including rhinoceros horn and tiger bone. People 
found involved in such activities face harsh punishment. 
  Deputy Director of the Fujian Wild Life Protection Fund Mr 
Bao Yingsen said that the trend of trafficking and smuggling 
rare species of animals had been on the rise in recent years. 
Incomplete statistics showed that a total of 520 cases of this 
kind were investigated and dealt with in the province last year 
alone with the seizure of a large number of items related to 
rare animals under state protection, including the skins of 
giant pandas, the skin and bones of tigers, a species of 
leopard, big lizards, rare species of cats, rhesus monkeys, 
pangolins and black bears, with all the confiscated items valued 
at over RMB 10 million [renminbi]. 
  Illegal elements trafficking and smuggling rare species of 
animals for big profits mainly came from some ten provinces 
while others were Taiwan businessmen. 
  The large-scale killing and poaching of rare species of 
animals has aroused serious concern. The fund joined forces 
with departments of forestry, public security and industry and 
commerce in launching a crack-down on these illegal activities, 
staging raids and sudden inspections on guesthouse, hotels, 
restaurants and agricultural and trade markets for the illegal 
handling of rare animals. They also dealt with the seized 
traditional Chinese ready- made medicines containing rhinoceros 
horn or tiger bone available in some drugstores and 
foreign-related guesthouses. 
  The Fujian authorities investigated 84 guesthouses and 
hotels 
found illegally handling wild animals during last October alone 
with the seizure of some 700 wild animals under state protection 
and over 10,000 animals including masked civet cats and snakes, 
none of which belong to the key category of rare animals under 
state protection. A number of illegal elements were dealt with 
and punished. A criminal found guilty of profiteering by 
selling a giant panda skin was sentenced to 15 years 
imprisonment by the Dongshan County People's Court and was 
deprived of his political rights for five years.

<F P=106> [Report by Shen Zhengfa (3088 2973 3127): "Make All-Out </F>
Efforts To Safeguard Jiangsu's Political and Social Stability -- 
Cao Hongming Delivers Work Report at the Provincial Judicial and 
Public Security Conference"] 
  [Text] A provincial conference on judicial and public 
security work opened in Nanjing on 24 January. The conference 
relayed the important instructions issued by the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee on strengthening 
judicial and public security work and the important speeches 
given by Comrades Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and Ren Jianxin at the 
national public security and judicial conference. Cao Hongming, 
deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and secretary 
of the provincial Commission on Politics and Law, delivered a 
work report. Yu Xingde, vice governor and deputy secretary of 
the provincial commission, chaired the conference. 
  Cao Hongming began his report by analyzing the current 
situation on the province's judicial and public security front. 
He pointed out: At present, the province enjoys political and 
social stability, which has served as an important guarantee for 
the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and economic 
construction. However, closer attention must still be paid to 
problems in public order. A total of 69,846 criminal cases 
occurred in the province last year, an increase of 6.7 percent 
over the previous year. Of the total number, 22,257 involved 
major crimes. As new structures replace the old and as the 
volumes of personnel, monetary, and property exchanges expand, 
factors contributing to violations of law and crimes have also 
notably increased. In the current new situation of reform, 
opening up, and accelerated economic construction, we must bring 
into full play the role of judicial and public security work in 
safeguarding and serving our cause. Judicial and public 
security work must be strengthened; it must not be weakened. 
  Cao Hongming pointed out: Our major public security and 
judicial tasks in 1994 are: Using Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
the "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee as guide, and taking into consideration the 
requirements for building a socialist market economic structure, 
we shall earnestly strengthen and reform judicial and public 
security work; augment the functions of the people's democratic 
dictatorship; resolutely crack down on the sabotage activities 
of hostile forces and elements as well as on serious criminal 
and economic offenses; implement measures for comprehensively 
tackling problems of public order in an all-around way; and 
strengthen the building of the public security and judicial 
ranks to effectively safeguard and serve, through the use of 
law, the construction and perfection of our socialist market 
economy and create a favorable social environment for the 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development of Jiangsu's economy. 
  Cao Hongming stressed: We must continue to maintain the 
strong momentum of the struggle launched in various localities 
to sternly and expeditiously punish serious criminal elements in 
accordance with the law. We must direct the primary spearhead 
of the struggle at major criminals who have a very bad influence 
on society, such as murderers, robbers, hooligans, rapists, 
kidnappers who cruelly harm their hostages, and burglars; and at 
violent and organized crimes, particularly those committed by 
underworld figures, gangs, and local criminal forces, which pose 
serious threats to public security. We must resolve every 
prominent problem of public order as soon as it appears; we must 
not allow it to become uncontrollable. We must deepen the 
struggle against corruption by concentrating on major, 
high-profile cases. We must investigate all corruption cases 
through to the end, regardless of the persons involved. We must 
correctly deal with contradictions within the ranks of people in 
the new situation, deepen investigation and research, and carry 
out ideological-political work with a clear objective in mind. 
  Cao Hongming pointed out: We must further mobilize all 
social forces, strengthen grass-roots work, and implement 
measures for comprehensively tackling problems of public order 
in an all-around way. We must strengthen population management 
with a clear objective in mind, intensify management and control 
of the social aspects of urban and rural activities, further 
improve crime prevention and control by the masses, strengthen 
traffic and fire prevention management, establish and perfect a 
leadership responsibility system to comprehensively tackle 
problems of public order, and earnestly implement the policy 
under which a leader is responsible for maintaining public order 
in areas under his jurisdiction. 
  Cao Hongming urged principal responsible comrades of the 
party and government at various levels in the province to devote 
more energy to judicial and public security work. He said: 
Responsible leaders should attend to specific work to 
strengthen guidance and inspection. Other leading comrades in 
different work posts should also concern themselves with 
judicial and public security work. Vigorous efforts should be 
made to improve the overall standards and fighting capacity of 
our public security and judicial ranks. A general drive to 
educate public security and judicial cadres and police in the 
goal of serving the people and building a clean government, and 
in the legal system should be launched to truly raise their 
ideological-political standards. 
  Dai Guangzhen, deputy director of the provincial party 
committee's Organization Department, gave a speech on 
implementing the leadership responsibility system to 
comprehensively tackle problems of public order. 
  More than 200 people attended the conference, including 
members of the provincial party committee's Commission on 
Politics and Law and Committee for Comprehensive Management of 
Public Security; responsible comrades of city and county party 
committees in charge of judicial and public security work; and 
responsible comrades of other relevant provincial and city 
departments.

  [Text] The date 5 February was the 25th day of the 12th 
month by the lunar calendar, and the Spring Festival is 
increasingly closer. Very early in the morning, Jiang Chunyun, 
secretary of the provincial party committee, came to Qihe 
County, with which he had established ties, to visit local 
cadres and people. He also visited villages and households to 
learn about peasants' production and life and to hear their 
voice, opinions, and suggestions. 
  Secretary Jiang first went to the (Maozhuang) Village of 
(Shouzhong) Township. The economy of the village was rather 
backward and people's life rather difficult due to its 
saline-alkali soil and the influence of the Huang He water 
diversion project. Secretary Jiang visited the home of an old 
woman (Ma Chuanwei) at a little pass nine in the morning. With 
deep concern, he asked about the old woman's health and asked 
her whether she had difficulties. The old woman said: You, 
provincial leaders, have come to see us despite your tight 
schedule. I am so moved that I do now know what to say. The 
income of my family declined this year because of the cold 
weather. However, we still earned more than 1,000 yuan and have 
more than 2,500 jin of grain. Our life is not so bad. Please 
do not worry about us. 
  Secretary Jiang said with a deep feeling: We will work out 
ways to address whatever difficulties you have so that you can 
achieve affluence as soon as possible. 
  At the home of (Zhu Zhaoshi), who had difficulty in life, 
(Zhu's) wife told Secretary Jiang: We have wheat and cabbage. 
Although we have little money at our disposal, our life is not 
too bad. We have no problem in spending the Spring Festival. 
  After visiting (Maozhuang) Village, Secretary Jiang again 
came to (Dayang) Village. This village became prosperous thanks 
to greenhouse cultivation of vegetables in the past few years. 
The secretary of the village party branch said to Secretary 
Jiang happily: Our village, which has a population of more than 
1,000, has built more than 83 greenhouses to grow 200 mu of 
(?fine vegetables) and 320 mu of (?ordinary) vegetables. Our 
per capita net income was 1,630 yuan in 1993. 
  Hearing this, Secretary Jiang smiled and said: Let's go to 
your greenhouse. At the vegetable greenhouse, Secretary was 
very happy to see the fresh cucumbers. He said: When delivered 
to Jinan, the cucumbers can be sold at good prices. The more 
you earn, the happier we will be. You may grow strawberries and 
[word indistinct] in the greenhouses to increase your income. 
  After visiting the greenhouse, Secretary Jiang came to the 
home of villager (Yang Chengming). He asked whether the village 
had collected plenty of accumulation funds. (Yang Chengming) 
answered: No. We, a family of four members, earn 9,000 yuan a 
year. Each of us pay merely 70 yuan as the village's 
accumulation funds. 
  Secretary Jiang said: The more prosperous the village 
becomes, the less the masses have to pay as the accumulation 
funds. Grass-roots cadres must do more solid work for the 
masses, attend to the two civilizations simultaneously, firmly 
embrace the mass viewpoint, and maintain close ties with the 
masses. In doing work, they should attach importance to methods 
and refrain from doing work in an oversimplified and crude way 
or through administrative orders. When the cadre-populace ties 
are good, it will be easier to do work. 
  After shaking hands with the people who came to say good-by 
at (Dayang) Village, Secretary Jiang continued his trip to 
another village.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Huang Ju Calls For Quickening the </F>
Pace of Government Economic Legislation; He Says: The Basic 
Principle for Doing Shanghai's Work Well Is To Take Reform as 
the Motive Force, Development as the Target, Make Stability the 
Foundation, and Legislation Serve As the Guarantee"] 
  [Text] At the legal work conference of the Shanghai 
Municipal Government on 25 January, Mayor Huang Ju made an 
important report entitled: "Quicken the Shanghai Government's 
Pace of Economic Legislation and Strive To Create a New 
Situation in Government Legislation Work." In the report, the 
mayor expounded the guiding ideology for the Shanghai 
government's legislation work in the next few years, its work 
target, and main tasks. 
  Huang Ju said: Our basic principle for doing various fields 
of work in Shanghai is to take reform as the motive force, 
development as the target, make stability the foundation, and 
legislation serve as the guarantee. He said: With the further 
deepening of reform, economic construction in Shanghai has been 
upgraded to a new level. As laws are the guarantee for the 
operation of a modern market economy, we should begin from a 
high starting point to undertake a project for securing 
Shanghai's socialist market economic structure. Huang Ju 
stressed: To carry out this "guarantee project," we must 
concentrate on three tasks. This means we must draw up a plan, 
establish standards for 10 areas of work, and fulfill the tasks 
of drafting approximately 100 laws and regulations, enacting 
them, and revising them each year. This year, Shanghai will 
draw up a fairly scientific and feasible government economic 
legislation plan suitable to the establishment of a socialist 
economic market structure, and strengthen overall guidance and 
coordination in connection with this plan. The standards for 
the 10 areas of work are: 1) The establishment of a modern 
enterprise system and adjustment of the relationship among the 
main bodies in the market; 2) the administration and management 
of state-owned assets; 3) cultivating and developing all types 
of commodity markets and markets for production elements; 4) 
improving and strengthening macroeconomic regulation and 
control, and promoting coordinated development of the economy; 
5) establishing a rational individual income distribution system 
and improving the social security system; 6) opening wider to 
the outside world and utilizing foreign capital; 7) accelerating 
the opening up and development of the Pudong New District; 8) 
developing and administering the markets intermediate 
organizations; 9) accelerating urban construction and 
strengthening urban administration; and 10) developing and 
administering such social undertakings as science, technology, 
education, culture, and public health. 
  Huang Ju pointed out: To strengthen the building of a legal 
system by the government, we must handle the following four 
relationships well: First, we must handle the relationship 
between legislation and administrative law-enforcement well. 
Legislation and law enforcement must not be separated because 
they form an entity. While stepping up legislation work, the 
government must concentrate on administrative law enforcement 
and overcome the failure to abide by the law, lax law 
enforcement, and letting law-breakers go free. Second, we must 
handle the relationship between transforming government 
functions and strengthening government law institutions well. 
Third, we must handle the relationship between government law 
administrative work and the launching of theoretical research on 
the government's legal system. We should take advantage of 
Shanghai's superiority in professional personnel to conduct a 
study and exploration with the help of experts and scholars to 
determine what problems need urgent solution in the course of 
Shanghai's reform and opening to the outside world. Fourth, we 
must handle the relationship between legal work and other 
government work well. In carrying out government legal work, it 
is necessary to listen to opinions from all quarters, and to 
fully embody and reflect the will of the people to find a new 
way of conducting government-level work by relying on social 
forces. Huang Ju said: In carrying out government legal work, 
such as the drawing of legislation plans, studying of problems, 
and exposition of laws and regulations, it is necessary to give 
full play to the role of experts. He said he welcomes more 
experts to participate in government legislation work. 
  The conference was presided over by Vice Mayor Xu Kuangdi. 
He set some requirements for implementing the guidelines of the 
conference and for further strengthening government legislation 
work. Xie Tianfang, director of the Office of Legal System 
under the municipal government, delivered a speech on the 
government's legislation tasks and legislation plans for 1994. 
Shi Zhusan, vice chairman of of the municipal committee of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, attended the 
conference.

committee, the autonomous regional people's congress, the 
autonomous regional government, and the autonomous regional

the memory of the 10th Panchen Lama. He was a great patriot and 
a banner for our united front. Although it has been five years 
since his death, his patriotic spirit, as well as his spirit of 
working hard for the country and the people, always deserves to 
be emulated and always inspires us to move forward. We also 
miss our Tibetan compatriots who are living in exile abroad. We 
hope that the Dalai Lama will end his exile at an early date, 
return to the motherland, contribute to the motherland's unity, 
national unity, and economic development; and do useful work to 
promote the Tibetan people's prosperity and happiness.

  [Text] Guiyang, February 6 (XINHUA) -- Latest statistics 
from the provincial government of inland Guizhou Province in 
southwest China show that the province approved the setting up 
of 500 foreign-funded enterprises last year.

dollars 
of foreign investment, up by 117 percent over the previous year. 
Altogether the province has 816 foreign-funded enterprises so

improvement of its investment environment. The province fully 
upgraded its telecommunications and power facilities last year. 
  The officials say that more foreign investment is flowing 
into the province's remote mountain regions and areas inhabited 
by minority nationalities to tap rich natural resources. 
  The investors, coming from 23 countries and regions, are 
expanding their businesses to industry, real estate development 
and everyday services for residents. 
  Last year, foreign trade of the foreign-funded enterprises 
hit more than 38 million U.S. dollars, taking up half of the

  [Text] On 5 February, the provincial committee of Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] and the 
united front work department under the provincial party 
committee jointly held a Spring Festival tea party for the 
figures on various circles. At the party, noted figures of 
various democratic parties, noted personages without party 
affiliation, members of the National CPPCC Committee living in 
Harbin, pertinent responsible comrades of the provincial party 
committee, the provincial people's congress standing committee, 
and the provincial government, and patriotic figures from 
various circles met together to celebrate Spring Festival. 
  On behalf of the provincial party committee and the 
provincial government, Sun Weiben, secretary of the provincial 
party committee, paid Spring Festival calls to all figures 
participating in the party and expressed heartfelt thanks and 
deep respects for the hard work done in the past year by various 
democratic parties, industrial and commercial federations, 
nonparty figures, and the friends on various circles of society. 
He said: Over the past year, the vast numbers of cadres and 
the masses in the province made great efforts to study Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, went all out to help implement the 12 major 
events defined by the provincial party committee, around the 
establishment of the socialist market economic structure, and 
made great efforts to overcome the difficulties in systems, 
structures, funds, and transportation, thus promoting economic 
development, political stability, national unity, and social 
progress of the province. 
  Sun Weiben said: In 1994, China's economic reform will step 
on a new stage that is as extensive and profound as never 
before. For the province's economy that has been seriously 
bound up by the traditional planned economic structure, it will 
be a new opportunity of development. It requires the people 
throughout the province and the figures on all circles to 
enhance morale and surmount difficulties with one heart and one 
mind in an effort to make Heilongjiang vigorous and strong. 
  Sun Weiben expressed hope that all democratic parties, 
industrial and commercial federations, and nonparty personages 
would utilize their wide contacts with domestic and overseas 
areas and their advantages in talents and knowledge to make new 
contributions to invigorating Heilongjiang's economy and bring 
benefits to Heilongjiang's people.

  [Text] On 2 February, accompanied by Xu Wencai, standing 
committee member and secretary general of the provincial party 
committee, and Wang Zhande, deputy secretary general of the 
provincial party committee, Gu Jinchi, secretary of the 
provincial party committee, visited working personnel of the 
letters and complaints offices of the provincial party committee 
and the provincial government and listened to the work reports 
made by responsible persons of these offices. 
  Gu Jinchi said: The letters and complaints work is an 
important work through which we can listen to the voice of the 
masses, rely on the masses, and maintain close ties with the 
masses. The masses can not only reflect their opinions and 
demands through the letters and complaints channels but also 
exercise supervision on cadres and party members and provide 
good opinions for the party and the government. Letters and 
complaints departments should serve as good advisers to the 
party and the government, strengthen the letters and complaints 
work at the grass-roots level, and make grass-roots levels more 
capable of solving problems on the spot. Letters and complaints 
departments at all levels should pay attention to studying the 
new situation in reform and do an even better job to ensure 
smooth progress in reform. In addition, Gu Jinchi demanded that 
leading comrades at all levels wholeheartedly support the work 
of letters and complaints departments and create conditions for 
them to do their work well.

  [Text] On the morning of 4 February, the provincial party 
committee and the provincial government held a Spring Festival 
tea party to entertain veteran Red Army men and veteran cadres 
of the provincial level. Over 500 veteran Red Army men and 
veteran cadres who previously worked for the provincial-level 
organs happily met together and extended greetings to each 
other. Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
and Dai Suli, former veteran leader of the province, gave 
speeches at the party. 
  There are some 190,000 retired veteran cadres in the 
province. Since last year, these veteran cadres have played an 
important role in maintaining political and social stability and 
building the socialist spiritual civilization. 
  On behalf of the provincial party committee and the 
provincial government, Gu Jinchi extended Spring Festival 
greetings to all veteran comrades of the province. After 
affirming the positive contributions made by veteran cadres in 
accelerating the province's reform and development, he pointed 
out: Now that we are precisely in the process of replacing the 
planned economy with the socialist market economic structure, 
the emergence of new contradictions and new difficulties is 
inevitable. Under the new situation, all levels of leaders 
should show concern for the weals and woes of veteran comrades 
and should do more tangible deeds for them. The first task we 
should do for veteran cadres after their retirement is to ensure 
that they spend their remaining years in happiness and good 
health. At the same time, we should arrange for them to attend 
study classes, show concern and love for them politically, and 
pay attention to making use of their role. 
  Dai Suli, former veteran leader of the province, also spoke 
at the tea party. He expressed hope that veteran cadres would 
study the Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping to keep pace with the development of the current 
situation. At the same time, he called on veteran comrades to 
make best possible use of their remaining strength under the 
leadership of the provincial party committee and the provincial 
government so that they can truly have something to do in their 
old age.

  [Text] Beijing, February 7 (XINHUA) -- China hopes that 
the countries concerned will cherish the overall interest of 
their relations with China and stand on guard against the 
political schemes of the Taiwan authorities. 
  A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Wu Jianmin, made the 
remarks here today when asked to comment on the report that Li 
Denghui [Li Teng-hui] of Taiwan plans to spend "holidays" during 
the spring festival in Indonesia and Thailand. 
  Under the disguise of "holidays" trips, the Taiwan 
authorities are trying to develop "substantive relations" with 
some countries, thus creating a situation of "two Chinas" in the 
world, Wu said. This is something the Chinese Government and 
people are strongly opposed to and can never accept. 
  Should the governments of the countries having diplomatic 
relations with China endorse Li Denghui's trips, in whatever 
name and form, it will deeply hurt the feelings of the Chinese 
people and damage the friendly relations and cooperation between 
China the and countries concerned, he stressed. 
  The spokesman noted that the Chinese Foreign Ministry has 
respectively expressed to the countries involved the serious 
concern of the Chinese Government. 
  "It is our hope that the countries concerned will cherish 
the 
overall interest of their relations with China, and stand on 
guard against the political schemes of the Taiwan authorities, 
so as to protect the hard-won friendly relations and cooperation 
between them and China from any disruption and sabotage," the 
spokesman said.

  [Text] Beijing, February 5 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese 
Government has lodged a strong protest with the Government of 
Burkina Faso and declared the suspension of China's diplomatic 
relations with Burkina Faso. 
  According to reports from Ouagadougou, Li Yongqian, Chinese 
ambassador to Burkina Faso, made serious representations with 
the Government of Burkina Faso yesterday. He solemnly stated 
that as the Government of Burkina Faso had "restored" the 
so-called "diplomatic relations" with the Taiwan authorities, 
the Chinese Government lodged a strong protest with the 
Government of Burkina Faso and declared the suspension of 
China's diplomatic ties with Burkina Faso. 
  Li pointed out that by doing so, the Burkina Faso Government 
had gone back on its solemn commitment contained in the 
communique of September 15, 1973 on the establishment of 
diplomatic relations between China and Burkina Faso that it 
recognized the Government of the People's Republic of China as 
the sole legal government representing the entire Chinese 
people, seriously undermining the existing friendly relations 
and cooperation between the two countries and the friendship 
between the two peoples. 
  He announced that the Government of the People's Republic of 
China decided, therefore, to suspend its diplomatic relations 
with Burkina Faso as of that day.

<F P=106> [Report by staff reporters] </F>
  [Text] The lifting of the 19-year United States trade 
embargo on Vietnam yesterday has been hailed as good news for 
Hong Kong -- it is great for business and will help end the 
refugee problem. 
  Business leaders say the territory will benefit as Vietnam 
enters a new era of opportunity and prosperity. Hong Kong is 
already the second-biggest investor in Vietnam, while many U.S. 
and other foreign firms investing there will use Hong Kong as a 
springboard. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton announced the end of the embargo 
yesterday. It was imposed in 1975 when U.S.-backed South 
Vietnam fell to the communist North. 
  Secretary for Security Alistair Asprey said the lifting of 
the embargo would show the 27,000 Vietnamese boat people in Hong 
Kong that "their future lies in Vietnam, not in a detention camp 
in Hong Kong. It will help get home the message that the 
Vietnam they left perhaps four, five years ago is different to 
the Vietnam today," he said. Mr. Asprey said he expected more 
Vietnamese to volunteer to go home, but cautioned it could still 
take two years before all were repatriated. 
  Since 1988, Hong Kong has given refugee status to only the 
15 
percent who could prove a justified fear of persecution. The 
rest are kept in closed camps and given cash incentives to go 
home. More than 41,000 boat people have volunteered to return 
home from Hong Kong. Nearly 13,000 more have been forcibly 
repatriated. 
  Meanwhile, Hong Kong traders were advised to move fast as 
the 
country opened up. Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC), 
executive director Francis Lo said: "Now is the time for Hong 
Kong companies to position themselves in that market so they can 
be ready to take full advantage of the lifting of the embargo." 
He said consumer products were especially in demand. 
  Mr. Lo said it would mean a new and important era of 
opportunity and prosperity in Vietnam. Despite the fact 
competition was bound to become more intense, Mr. Lo said the 
outlook for Hong Kong companies was encouraging. He stressed 
that the territory must move quickly in Vietnam to stay ahead of 
competitors from other Asian countries. 
  Hong Kong is Vietnam's biggest source of investment after 
Taiwan, after rising 51 percent to $296.4 million in 1992. Hong 
Kong's domestic exports to Vietnam increased another 14 percent 
in the first 11 months of 1993 to reach $319.8 million. 
  The Vietnamese trade representative in Hong Kong, Dao Tran 
Nhan, said Hong Kong would benefit from an end to the embargo 
because many American firms already had their regional 
headquarters here. He said the Hanoi government was drafting 
laws to protect foreign investors. 
  Foreign companies would use Hong Kong as a springboard, 
though some would invest directly, Mr. Nhan said. Mr. Nhan also 
said Hong Kong entrepreneurs who had already invested in Vietnam 
would not lose out because of competition from the Americans. 
He said most Hong Kong investments were in the tourism industry. 
  The Hanoi government hailed the decision yesterday and vowed 
to keep cooperating with efforts to account for Americans 
missing in action (MIA) from the war. Deputy Foreign Minister 
Le Mai also said Vietnam accepted Mr. Clinton's proposal that 
the two countries exchange liaison offices, but stressed that 
Hanoi still sought full diplomatic relations with Washington. 
  He said the opening of liaison offices should come soon, but 
he would not guess how long it would take to normalize 
diplomatic relations. "That depends on the goodwill of the two 
sides," he said, adding that Vietnam wanted "normalization 
without preconditions". 
  But Mr. Mai bristled at Mr. Clinton's comment that his 
decision was not irreversible, saying that trade embargoes 
violated international law and so did threats to reimpose them. 
He would not be drawn on his personal reaction to the news: "I 
think the Vietnam issue is a very emotional one in the United 
States. We, the Vietnamese, are less emotional about it."

  [Text] Beijing, February 4 (XINHUA) -- The Association for 
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) on the Mainland and 
the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) have made 
great achievements during four days of discussions here, 
smoothly solving three issues of routine affairs, including the 
repatriation of hijackers. 
  Tang Shubei, executive vice-president of ARATS, and Zou 
Zhekai, vice-president and secretary general of ARATS, held 
meetings with Chiao Jen-ho, vice-chairman and secretary general 
of SEF, in Beijing on February 1-4. 
  After four days of discussions, they reached understandings 
on many important issues. 
  First, both sides feel that they have reached understanding 
on three issues of routine affairs, namely, the repatriation of 
hijackers, the treatment of maritime fishing disputes and the 
issue of sending back other personnel who cross the straits in 
violation of relevant regulations. 
  They said that this has laid a good foundation for the 
fourth 
working meeting between the two organizations to be held soon 
and the signing of a written agreement. 
  Both sides have agreed to hold the fourth working meeting on 
the three issues in late March in Beijing, at which a draft 
agreement will be decided upon between the two bodies. 
  Chiao Jen-ho hoped that Tang Shubei and his counterparts 
with 
ARATS will proceed to sign a formal agreement on the basis of 
the draft in Taipei. 
  Second, also during the March meeting, the two bodies will 
discuss other unfinished issues included in the agreement 
reached between ARATS President Wang Daohan and SEF Chairman Koo 
Chen-fu last year. The issues will include the protection of 
intellectual property rights on the two sides across the Taiwan 
Straits, contacts and mutual aid between courts on the two sides 
across the Taiwan Straits and joint operations against maritime 
smuggling, robbery and other criminal activities. Besides, they 
will formally discuss issues of economic exchange and cultural, 
educational, scientific and technological exchanges. 
  Third, Tang Shubei presented a letter to Chiao on behalf of 
ARATS President Wang Daohan to invite SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu 
to meet on the Mainland. 
  Chiao Jen-ho said he would actively create conditions for 
the 
meeting between Wang and Koo. The time and venue of the 
Wang-Koo meeting will be discussed at the March meeting. 
  Fourth, the two sides agreed to work together to properly 
handle inherited property of those who left the mainland before 
the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. 
  During the meeting this afternoon, they agreed to publish a 
joint news release about their achievements. Each side has 
designated a vice secretary general to be in charge of the 
drafting of the news bulletin, which will be issued tomorrow. 
  The discussions were fruitful and lived up to the 
expectations of the Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, 
Tang Shubei said at a press conference after the meeting. 
  During the four days of discussions, each side deepened its 
trust of the other and had a better understanding of the other's 
viewpoints, Tang said. 
  The results of the talks proved once again that high-level 
exchanges were very important, Tang said. Such exchanges can 
deepen trust on a higher level and solve differences which are 
not problems they appear to be, he said.

<F P=106> [By XINHUA reporter Li Renhu (2621 0088 5706) and SHANXI </F>
RIBAO reporter Li Dongxi (2621 2639 0823)] 
  [Text] Taiyuan, 3 Feb (XINHUA) -- It was the dead of 
winter at the end of the year. Chairman Jiang Zemin, general 
secretary of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the 
Central Military Commission, braved the severe cold and crossed 
mountain after mountain to travel through Shanxi. He brought 
with him the concern and warmth of the party Central Committee, 
State Council, and Central Military Commission to grass-roots 
units as well as to the hearts of the vast number of workers, 
peasants, soldiers, and intellectuals. He pointed out: Showing 
concern for the masses in all respects, relying on the masses in 
every matter, and gearing all our work toward the interests of 
the masses is the party's fundamental aim and working line as 
well as the party's vivid characteristic and political edge. 
Leading cadres and the vast number of party members should 
firmly remember the historical truth that people are the real 
heroes and origin of victory especially when times are more 
advanced and our undertakings more developed, and work more 
sincerely for the interests of the people. Our undertakings in 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics will then 
develop more vigorously. 
  Accompanied by Fu Quanyou, director of the General Logistics 
Department; Hu Fuguo, secretary of the Shanxi provincial party 
committee; Acting Shanxi Governor Sun Wensheng; and Li Laizhu, 
commander of the Beijing Military Region, General Secretary 
Jiang Zemin successively inspected Xinzhou, Luliang, Yuncheng, 
Linfen, Taiyuan, and Jinzhong prefectures from 29 January to 3 
February. He visited peasant families; schools; plants; mines; 
and barracks; as well as peasants; workers; officers and men of 
the People's Liberation Army; public security cadres and 
policemen; officers and men of the armed police force; school 
teachers and students; masses in old revolutionary and 
poverty-stricken areas; and cadres working at the grass-roots 
level. Wherever he went, he held intimate conversions with the 
masses, asked about their welfare, listened to their opinions 
and demands, and extended New Year greetings to them. 
  On 29 January, Luliang prefecture was covered with a layer 
of 
snow and the temperature was 20 degrees Celsius below zero. 
Ignoring the severe cold and fatigue, Jiang Zemin went straight 
to Xingxian county's Caijiaya in the old revolutionary area. He 
visited the Jinsui Revolution Memorial Hall and called on 
veteran heroes, veteran revolutionaries, and martyrs' family 
members to convey his cordial greetings and take photographs 
with them. He earnestly told the cadres and people: The state 
power of the people's republic was established by 
revolutionaries of the older generation, and the party and 
government always remembers them. We must continue the martyrs' 
unfulfilled will, carry forward the contributory spirit of the 
people in old revolutionary areas, and work arduously to develop 
Luliang prefecture. 
  General Secretary Jiang was worried about the people's lives 
in poverty-stricken mountain regions. Throughout his trip, he 
saw people busily buying goods for the Spring Festival, and was 
particularly pleased to see the joyous atmosphere. At about 
1600 on the afternoon of 29 January, Jiang Zemin traveled 
through a 3-km long valley and came to Mingwanta village in 
Linxian county, Shanxi's largest poor county. Jiang Zemin 
walked briskly up the slope and entered the house of peasant Li 
Sier. He held the Li couple's hands and asked about their 
family, the size of their farm, grain production, and annual 
income. The young couple was moved by the party's concern, and 
they vowed to shake off their poverty to become well-off as soon 
as possible. Later, Jiang Zemin entered a low earthen cave 
dwelling, the home of poverty-stricken Liu Zhengyang. He held 
the hands of Liu Zhengyang's 71-year-old mother and asked about 
her welfare. He lifted the cooking pot cover and asked whether 
they had enough food, and checked the fireplace. He repeatedly 
reminded village cadres to look after poor households. 
Meanwhile, the masses who heard about the visit rushed to the 
scene. Standing on the undulating slope on top of the cave 
dwellings, they clapped their hands to welcome General Secretary 
Jiang. Jiang Zemin smilingly extended new year greetings to 
them all. The people said simultaneously: "General Secretary 
Jiang, you have worked hard. We hope you will come again." The 
heart of the party's general secretary was linked to those of 
the people, and the entire mountain village was submerged in a 
joyous and encouraging mood. 
  Shanxi still has some poor areas. However, the arduous, 
pioneering, and hardworking spirit of the people and cadres in 
the poverty-stricken areas, as well as their firm belief in the 
party and socialist undertakings, deeply impressed the general 
secretary. Jiang Zemin said: If cadres of all levels always 
showed their concern for poverty-stricken areas, shared the joys 
and sorrows of the people, and upheld the guidance of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line, we would certainly 
achieve advanced results and change the outlook of 
poverty-stricken areas by adopting practical measures; promoting 
aid work for the poor; and maintaining our arduous struggle. We 
must be determined, adopt more good policies, and strive to 
accomplish the great task of eliminating absolute poverty in the 
entire country by the end of this century, to thoroughly solve 
the issue of the survival rights of Chinese people, who make up 
one-quarters of the world's population. This will not only be a 
great event in the history of Chinese people but also a 
magnificent feat in human history. He also stressed: The 
development and stability of the rural areas is always crucial 
to nationwide social development and stability. The tasks to 
strengthen the role of agriculture as the foundation of the 
national economy should not waver at anytime. We must not 
slacken, in the slightest degree, in the production of principal 
agricultural products such as grains, cotton, and edible oil. 
  In Linfen city's Qiaoli village, Jiang Zemin carefully 
listened with great interest to what veteran party branch 
secretary Wang Yunkang said. Wang Yunkang, who has been a 
village cadre for 40 years, animatedly briefed Jiang Zemin on 
how his party branch had led local masses to adhere to the 
socialist course to achieve common prosperity, and on how he had 
made efforts to build up his village party branch. He said: A 
good party branch must be politically sensitive, ideologically 
correct, democratic in work style, and economically clean. In 
short, the party branch and the masses must stand together 
through thick and thin, and they should share joys and sorrows. 
After Wang Yunkang finished, the general secretary nodded and 
said applaudingly: You have done a great job and what you just 
said makes a lot of sense. Your experience shows the core of 
grass-roots work in rural areas is to build a good party branch. 
The primary reason why your village party branch has a unifying 
force, rallying power, and combat capability is that you have 
truly integrated the party's policy with your local reality, and 
have truly transformed the party central committee's guidelines 
into the masses' self-conscious act, thereby bringing economic 
prosperity to the village and making progress in your work in 
all areas. If village party branches across the country were 
like your party branch, our rural work would be much easier. 
Your experience also shows that once the rural areas' dual 
management system that combines household with collective 
operations, which is based on the establishment of the contract 
responsibility system with remuneration linked to output, is 
refined; once rural areas' agricultural, forestry, animal 
husbandry, sideline production, and fishery industries are 
developed; and once rural areas' collective economies have 
become stronger, the prospects for building new and modern 
socialist rural areas will be better and better. Jiang Zemin 
also told leading cadres accompanying him: Not only should 
rural areas work to consolidate their leading bodies, build up 
work forces, and improve work style, but party committees and 
governments at all levels should also insist on doing so. If we 
have strong leading bodies, competent work forces, and a good 
work style on all fronts, we will be able to stand the test of 
all kinds of difficulties and crises, and we will win victory 
after victory in our work. 
  Jiang Zemin also visited Linxian county's project employing 
comprehensive measures to fight soil erosion; Yuncheng's project 
to develop shoals in the Huang He and its project of diverting 
the Huang He water for irrigation use; and the project to widen 
the Hongdong section of the 309 State Highway, which is an 
important road for the transportation of Shanxi's coal. He 
fully approved Shanxi's efforts since the beginning of this 
winter to mobilize office cadres, workers, school teachers and 
students, and troops to do voluntary work -- repairing roads and 
taking part in the construction of capital farming projects and 
other key projects. He told Hu Fuguo, Sun Wensheng, and other 
comrades that they had done a good job and hoped they would keep 
up their good work. He pointed out insightfully: In the 
construction of some public projects, it is necessary to call on 
office cadres and people of all trades to do some voluntary 
work. This has many benefits. It is one of our party's fine 
traditions as well as a practical expression of our socialist 
politics; it not only helps develop our material civilization 
but also helps develop our spiritual civilization, to cement 
solidarity among the masses, bring party-masses relations 
closer, and improve our leading style. 
  Wherever he went, Jiang Zemin went deep down to inspect 
local 
factories and mining enterprises, and to extend his regards to 
workers. He visited the Yuncheng Plate Making Plant, Yongji 
Railway Electric Machinery and Devices Factory, Xishan Mining 
Bureau's Guandi Mine, and Taiyuan Railway Sub-bureau, and called 
on workers on the production forefront and their families. 
Jiang Zemin pointed out to cadres and workers of state-owned 
enterprises: Currently, state-owned enterprises are facing 
numerous difficulties. The party and government understand this 
very well and are always concerned about it. In developing the 
socialist market economy, state-owned enterprises -- especially 
large and medium enterprises that are closely related to the 
country's economic development and the people's livelihood -- 
must enhance not weaken their capabilities and must effectively 
prevent the loss of state assets, because these are a basic 
criterion for measuring the results of the reform of our 
economic system. All party members must have a very clear 
understanding of this. To improve the performance of 
state-owned enterprises, we must further transform the operating 
mechanisms, adjust the organizational structure, and adopt a 
modern enterprise management system. At the same time, these 
enterprises need necessary support from the state. In 
particular, workers of state- owned enterprises should work hand 
in hand, and fully bring their enthusiasm and creativity into 
play. 
  On 3 February, Jiang Zemin held a discussion meeting at the 
Taiyuan Railway Subbureau, where he was briefed on rules 
regarding all-around implementation of ideological and political 
work. Workers and staff members throughout the subbureau have 
followed the work rules for eight years, achieved good results, 
and amassed considerable experience. During the discussion 
meeting, the general secretary pointed out: You have carried 
out meticulous and lively ideological and political work, during 
various periods, in all areas for which the subbureau is 
responsible, and in all fields of work carried out by the 
subbureau; this is commendable. The more we deepen reform and 
develop the economy, the more we should strengthen all aspects 
of ideological and political work in all lines of work. 
  Jiang Zemin also held a discussion meeting with renowned 
model workers in Shanxi Province at the Xishan Mining Bureau, 
which was attended by model workers Li Shuangliang, Shen Jilan, 
Guo Fenglian, Li Cheng, Hao Xiaoming, Fu Changwang, and Wang 
Cuicui. They told the general secretary about their practical 
experiences, made work proposals, and reflected the people's 
wishes. Jiang Zemin said: You are honorable representatives who 
have come to the fore from among workers, peasants, and 
intellectuals. Your advanced deeds fully demonstrate the 
necessity of wholeheartedly relying on the working class, the 
worker-peasant alliance, and the masses at all times, whether 
during revolution, construction, or reform. These are the 
sources of our strength and the foundations of our success. 
Respect for model workers and advanced characters means respect 
for people's practical work and pioneering spirit. Not only did 
we undergo rigorous tests during the revolutionary war but we 
have also encountered many new trials during reform, opening up, 
and modernization, some of which are very severe. If our 
comrades do not maintain vigilance and strengthen study and 
self-cultivation, they run the risk of being dismissed as 
useless. I hope that model workers will be able to withstand 
all kinds of tests at all times, including the test of their 
honor, and will continue to perform meritorious services for the 
party and people. I especially hope that our cadres will guard 
against conceit and impetuosity, show honesty and 
self-discipline, and fight a winning, not losing, battle against 
all kinds of ordeals. 
  During the inspection, Jiang Zemin also paid personal visits 
to military troops and barracks to find out about the learning, 
training, and living conditions of commanders and fighters. 
Upon seeing fighters on duty outside a certain grass-roots unit 
at the National Defense Science, Technology, and Industry 
Commission, the general secretary immediately got out of his 
car, clasped their hands, felt their clothes, and asked them 
whether they felt cold. At a certain tank regiment, Jiang Zemin 
entered the dormitory for new recruits to the 4th Squad of the 
1st Company and asked them whether they were homesick. He 
smiled in relief when the fighters unanimously said they were 
serving the military without any worries. He told the regiment's 
commanders and fighters on a hopeful note: Cadres should cherish 
fighters, veteran soldiers should help new recruits, and new 
recruits should respect veteran soldiers. They should unite as 
one, strengthen political studies, conduct military training 
properly, and build troops into all-around militant collectives. 
At a certain infantry regiment, Jiang Zemin inspected its 
amenities service center, and visited cadres and fighters who 
were undergoing training. He urged military cadres to strive to 
acquire knowledge in new and high science and technology to meet 
the demands of the new situation and tasks. 
  Jiang Zemin expressed great concern for schooling and 
education for children in rural areas, especially those in 
mountainous regions. Whenever he arrived in a village, he would 
insist on inspecting kindergartens, and primary and middle 
schools. He praised Shanxi for implementing Project Hope and 
building schools to solve education problems for children in 
poor areas. He repeatedly pointed out: In the final analysis, 
economic development and social progress are determined by the 
improvement of the people's quality, and of scientific and 
cultural levels in all sectors of society. It takes 100 years 
to cultivate people, and education is the foundation. 
Neglecting education is a short-sighted and dangerous act. In 
carrying out education in rural areas, we must consider local 
realities, readjust the school structure, and train more 
personnel of the junior middle school level that are badly 
needed for local development. 
  Also accompanying General Secretary Jiang Zemin during his 
inspection and visits to the people were responsible persons 
from relevant central departments, such as Zeng Qinghong, Ye 
Qing, Liu Jiang, Han Zhubin, Zhang Youcai, Teng Wensheng, and 
Yang Yongzhe.

<F P=106> ["Zhu Rongji Points Out During Inspection of Fujian: Fujian </F>
Has Created a Relaxed Environment for Reform; Haicang Is Now 
Equipped With the Conditions for All-Around Development"] 
  [Text] Fuzhou, 6 Feb (XINHUA) -- Zhu Rongji, Standing 
Committee member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau 
and vice premier of the State Council, inspected Fuzhou and 
Xiamen from 3 to 5 February. While inspecting the Haicang 
project investment zone in Xiamen, the vice premier pointed out: 
Under the vigorous support of relevant State Council 
departments since 1990, especially since 1992, and through the 
efforts of the Fujian provincial and Xiamen city party and 
government leaders and the masses of people, the investment zone 
has made great progress in infrastructure construction. 
Equipped with essential roads, water and electricity supplies, 
and communications, the investment zone is now ready for 
all-around development. Great progress has also been made in 
leveling the requisitioned land inside the zone and constructing 
amenities outside it as well as other supporting facilities 
related to the zone. All of this has laid a sound foundation 
for the investment zone's future development and construction, 
as well as for Xiamen's further development. 
  After listening to briefings by officials of the Fujian 
provincial party committee and government, and the Fuzhou and 
Xiamen city party committees and governments, Zhu Rongji fully 
affirmed their achievements in recent years. He said: Guided 
by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and led by the party Central Committee 
with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, Fujian -- the coastal 
pioneering province in opening to the outside world -- has 
undergone tremendous changes and scored remarkable achievements 
in reform and economic development. 
  Accompanied by Jia Qinglin, provincial party secretary and 
governor, Zhu Rongji inspected the Taijiang farmers' market in 
Fuzhou, the largest farmers' market in the province. With great 
interest, he threaded his way through the crowd, frequently 
stopping at vegetable, fish, and rice stalls to inquire of their 
owners about supplies, purchase prices, sales, marketing prices, 
and income. After listening to the consumer response to market 
supplies, the vice premier expressed satisfaction with the 
market's large stocks and the stable prices of goods. He said: 
Fujian Province has attached great importance to and done a 
solid job in promoting agriculture and the vegetable basket 
project. Prices have slipped back as a result of plentiful 
supplies of nonstaple food, especially vegetables, to the 
satisfaction of consumers. Social stability has helped create a 
relaxed environment for reform and economic development this 
year. 
  While in Fujian, the vice premier held separate discussions 
on taxation reform with officials of industrial and business 
enterprises and tax offices in Fuzhou and Xiamen cities, and 
listened to their opinions attentively. The officials generally 
expressed understanding and support for the State Council's 
taxation reform program, and offered suggestions for solving 
problems in the course of implementation. After hearing a 
report by the Furi Company, Zhu Rongji praised it for not 
raising the marketing price of its products -- television sets 
-- despite a hike in the prices of imported raw materials, 
parts, and components caused by the increased tax base figure. 
He pointed out: As a result of the recent taxation reform, 
about 28 percent of state-owned businesses will shoulder a 
slightly heavier tax burden. It is hoped that to absorb the 
increased prices of raw materials, these businesses will further 
improve management, cut back on expenses, and lower production 
costs, rather than raise product prices which will trigger price 
rises of other commodities. What they do should be a credit, 
not a smear, to reform. In response to the Fujian Bulb Plant's 
report about some monopolizing businesses taking the opportunity 
of taxation reform to increase product prices while adding a 17 
percent value-added tax based on the increased price, the vice 
premier immediately instructed the relevant department to 
conduct an investigation and duly handle any violation. He 
urged all State Council departments concerned to earnestly 
review progress in the taxation reform program since it was 
initiated a month ago; pay close attention to studying 
suggestions and problems in general brought up at the 
discussions; and take action to improve and perfect the program 
in order to ensure the smooth progress of taxation reform. 
  During his inspection tour of the Haicang project 
investment zone, Zhu Rongji also called on cadres and workers 
who were still working industriously at the various construction 
sites prior to Spring Festival, to extend regards and New Year 
greetings to those remaining at their posts. A responsible 
person of the Haicang administrative committee gave Zhu Rongji a 
report, saying: Construction of some parts of the Haicang 
project has begun. Construction of the main body of the Xianglu 
Terylene Fiber Project, which is capable of manufacturing 
180,000 metric tons of polyester products a year, has been 
largely completed, and installation of equipment will begin 
soon. At the same time, preparation work for the construction 
of other downstream projects, such as the PVC Tubing Plant, will 
also start soon. After listening to the report, Zhu Rongji said 
happily: The development and construction of the Haicang 
project investment zone have entered a new phase. This project 
will certainly push forward the development of Xiamen's economy. 
  Zhu Rongji put forward some important suggestions for the 
next- step development and construction of the Haicang project. 
He called for accelerating the construction of such 
infrastructure facilities as the Gaoyu Power Plant and the coal 
handling wharf, and for improving the investment environment. 
He also called for stepping up construction of the Xianglu 
Terylene Fiber Plant, which is under construction, and for 
making good preparations for installing the plant's equipment to 
complete the project and put it into operation according to 
schedule. At the same time, he also called for efforts to make 
preparations for construction of other projects related to the 
Haicang project to bring about a new situation regarding its 
development and construction. 
  Accompanying Zhu Rongji on the inspection tour were He 
Chunlin, Chen Jinhua, Wang Zongyu, Gu Xiulian, Yu Zhen, Dai 
Xianglong, Li Yanling, Li Yizhong, Pan Liansheng, and Zhang 
Xianghai, all responsible persons of the relevant departments 
under the State Council.

<F P=106> [By reporter Wu Jincai (0702 6930 2088)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 3 Feb (XINHUA) -- Comrade Bo Yibo pointed 
out: A correct, comprehensive understanding of Deng Xiaoping's 
exposition on development speed and economic returns is 
essential to maintaining the sustained, rapid and healthy growth 
[chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 
4099 1455] of China's economy. 
  The organizing committee for "An In-Depth Look at Economic 
Returns in China" sponsored a "Forum on Deng Xiaoping's Ideas 
Concerning the Improvement of Economic Returns." In an 
impromptu speech at the forum, Honorary Chairman Bo Yibo said: 
The country's economy is now growing vigorously, while initial 
successes have been made in macroeconomic regulation and 
control. The situation is heartening. The whole nation, full 
of confidence, is trying hard to push China's economy to a new 
height by following the principle of seizing the current 
opportunity for development, deepening reform, opening wider to 
the outside world, promoting development, and maintaining 
stability. All of you present here today have charge of 
improving economic returns. As you are in this business, you 
must be soberly aware of the fact that low economic returns 
nationwide remain largely unchanged. For example, the composite 
index for industrial economic returns fell at the end of 1993. 
We must, in particular, watch out for the bad tendency arising 
in some localities toward blindly undertaking construction 
projects, overextending construction scale, blindly seeking 
development speed, and neglecting economic returns. The scale 
of fixed assets investment is so large as to exceed what China's 
financial capabilities can withstand. Regarding publicity on 
economic work, not enough attention has been given to 
highlighting the importance of improving economic returns. 
Under these circumstances, it is necessary to study in a 
comprehensive manner -- and to unify our thinking on -- Comrade 
Xiaoping's ideas on combining development speed with economic 
returns to make sure that high speed and high economic returns 
promote each other and help bring about the sustained, rapid, 
and healthy growth of China's economy. 
  Comrade Bo Yibo spoke of his understanding of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's exposition on the relationship between development 
speed and economic returns. Comrade Xiaoping's ideas of 
"development being the last word" and "being conducive to the 
three causes" [developing the productive forces of socialist 
society; increasing the overall strength of socialist society; 
and improving the people's living standard] are the operative 
ideas concerning pushing China's economy to a new height. 
Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "If development is possible, we 
should not block the way. Localities with suitable conditions 
should carry out development as quickly as they can. As long as 
attention is paid to economic efficiency, product quality, and 
foreign economic exchange, we need not be worried about 
anything." He also said: "We must strive really hard to upgrade 
the economy to a new level every few years. We are, certainly, 
not encouraging unrealistic high growth rates. Rather, we should 
do solid work, stress economic returns, and bring about steady 
and well-balanced development." As far as I know, this has been 
Comrade Xiaoping's consistent idea. Over the past 10-plus 
years, he has repeatedly stressed this dialectical unity between 
development speed and high economic returns. We must try our 
best to achieve a relatively high growth rate. It is both 
possible and necessary for China to achieve an annual growth 
rate of 8 to 9 percent in line with its economic strength, 
financial capabilities, and materials supply. We must combine 
development speed with economic returns, product quality, and 
market demand. A low development speed and underproduction will 
adversely affect the improvement of China's overall economic 
strength and living standards; we must not allow this to happen. 
Neither excessive stockpiles nor redundant construction should 
be tolerated. Inventories of industrial enterprises covered in 
government budgets amounted to 170 billion yuan at the end of 
last year. What a gargantuan figure this is! What does it 
signify? Comrades: Think about it! 
  In conclusion, Bo Yibo stressed: An organic combination of 
high speed with high economic returns serves as an "inevitable 
road" for us to achieve the strategy of modernizing China in 
three phases. This is not only an economic issue, but also a 
political one. 
  Also speaking at yesterday's forum were Wang Zhongyu, 
minister in charge of State Economics and Trade Commission; and 
Sun Shangqing, director of the Development Research Center of 
the State Council. They noted that in order to raise the 
nation's economy to a new height and improve its overall level, 
we must combine development speed with high economic returns. 
The fundamental way to improve economic returns lies in raising 
the technological level of enterprises and lowering production 
costs. Other speakers included Fan Jingyi, editor in chief of 
RENMIN RIBAO; Yang Weiguang, director of the China Central 
Television; Min Fanlu, deputy editor in chief of the XINHUA news 
agency; and Ai Feng, member of the Editorial Board of RENMIN 
RIBAO.

  [Text] Beijing, February 7 (XINHUA) -- China appeals to 
the parties concerned in Bosnia-Herzegovina to immediately stop 
all hostilities, said a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman here 
today. 
  The spokesman made the remark when asked to comment on the 
February 5 incident, in which an exploded shell in Sarajevo 
wounded and killed hundreds of people. 
  Noting that the grave incident has shocked and enraged the 
international community, he said "We strongly condemn this 
atrocity", and that the fundamental way out in bringing the 
conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina to an end lies in political 
solution. 
  "We appeal to the parties concerned in Bosnia-Herzegovina to 
immediately stop all hostilities, and settle their differences 
properly through earnest negotiations so as to lift the people 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina from the scourge of war at an early date", 
the spokesman said.

  [Text] Washington, February 6 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President 
Bill Clinton met today with senior aides on how to tackle the 
worsening violence in Bosnia amid rising calls for air strikes. 
  However, few people believe that the option of air strikes 
would be taken any time soon, taking into account the thousands 
of lightly-armed U.N. troops in the Balkan Republic. 
  A mortar shell exploded Saturday [5 February] at a crowded 
market in Sarajevo, killing at least 68 people and wounding more 
than 200, the largest single civilian casualties since war broke 
in the former Yugoslav Republic 22 months ago. 
  Washington condemned the "cowardly act" and urged the U.N. 
for speedy identification of those responsible. 
  "We do not rule out the use of NATO air strikes once 
responsibility has been fixed," Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher said Saturday in a written statement. 
  Christopher said he discussed the incident with British 
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd yesterday and planned further 
consultation with other allies. 
  The U.S. sent an eight-member medical team and three cargo 
planes to Sarajevo earlier today to evacuate the victims. 
Pentagon said more help would be extended after injury 
assessment. 
  While threatening force, the U.S. reiterated calls for a 
negotiated settlement. 
  "It is time for responsible leaders among the warring 
factions to step forward and be counted. It is time for the 
international community to stand together and bring the maximum 
pressure to bear," William Perry, the new U.S. defense 
secretary, said at a conference in Munich, Germany.

  [Text] Bonn, February 6 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Defense Minister 
William Perry said today NATO forces were ready to launch air 
strikes in Bosnia but cautioned that the United States would not 
do so without consultation with Western allies. 
  There was no doubt about NATO's capability of launching air 
strikes and within an hour after the order was issued, he told a 
conference on European security in Munich. 
  But he was also cautious about the military action in the 
former Yugoslav republic which has been embroiled in civil war 
for the past 22 months. 
  "I can tell you unequivocally at this stage that we will not 
take any military action without considering seriously the 
effect on the situation in Bosnia, and we will not invoke air 
strikes unilaterally, not with 28,000 troops of our allies on 
the ground in Bosnia," he said. 
  The United States and several other NATO countries currently 
have military attack jets based in Italy awaiting any decision 
by UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to launch air 
strikes in Bosnia. 
  Perry, who was sworn in as secretary of defense only two 
days 
ago to replace Les Aspin, said the U.S. had been in close 
contact with Western Europe and the United Nations following a 
mortar attack on a market place in the Bosnian capital of 
Sarajevo on Saturday which killed 68 people and wounded about 
200. 
  The bloody incident has prompted even more calls for outside 
intervention. France urged international action, including the 
use of air power, to lift the siege of Sarajevo. The Russian 
Foreign Ministry has also expressed its anger over the atrocity. 
  After attending the security conference, Perry flew back to 
Washington to consult with President Bill Clinton over the 
latest killings in Bosnia and their moves to check further 
massacres in the war-torn territory.

  [Text] United Nations, February 4 (XINHUA) -- The UN 
Security Council today changed the brief of its Somalia 
peacekeeping mission (UNOSOM) by deciding to abandon any attempt 
to disarm Somalia factions by force. 
  In a unanimous resolution, the council limited UNOSOM's 
mandate to assisting the Somalia parties in achieving national 
reconciliation, providing humanitarian relief and protecting 
major ports and airport, etc. 
  A direct outcome was that the council also authorized a 
gradual reduction of the UN Somalia peacekeeping forces to 
22,000. 
  The UN Operation had over 30,000 soldiers at its peak and 
currently there are about 25,700 troops. 
  The resolution follows the UN's failure to forcibly disarm 
Somalia factions. 
  U.S. troops last summer masterminded operations in Mogadishu 
in a search for faction leader Mohamed Farah Aidid, whose 
supporters were accused of killing 25 Pakistani peacekeepers in 
June. 
  When 18 U.S. soldiers were killed on October 3, the United 
States, facing strong domestic opposition to military 
involvement in Somalia, announced it would complete its 
withdrawal by the end of March. 
  Since then the UN policy towards Somalia has been under 
scrutiny. 
  The Chinese ambassador to the UN, Li Zhaoxing, noted the 
importance of a political settlement on the issue. 
  "The international community had become increasingly aware 
that the final solution to the Somali question lies within the 
Somali people themselves and the key to it is the realization of 
broadly- based national reconciliation," he said. 
  "UNOSOM's experience and lessons have shown that the 
fundamental and effective way for a settlement is by peaceful 
means. Resorting to military action will only serve to 
complicate the matter," he added.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 4 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) today accused the United 
States of interfering in its internal affairs by "gravely 
distorting DPRK's reality" on human rights. 
  The official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said the 
recently released U.S. "Annual Report on Human Rights in the 
World" statement that the DPRK violates human rights was a 
"shameless intervention" into DPRK's internal affairs. 
  The U.S. move was aimed at harming DPRK's image so as to 
isolate the country in the international community, said the 
agency. 
  In fact, it stressed, the government of the DPRK guarantees 
genuine freedom and rights for all citizens. 
  On the other hand, it added, the United States is one of the 
countries that most gravely tramples human rights. The KCNA 
urged the United States to immediately stop activities which 
attack the DPRK and socialism using the excuse of "human rights 
issue."

  [Text] Washington, February 5 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. 
Government is to increase its financial assistance to the 
worldwide population control, official sources said here today. 
  "If we can't stabilize the world's population, we're not 
going to be able to control any other problems," said State 
Department Counselor Tim Wirth, who is in charge of population 
policy. 
  President Bill Clinton announced last Monday the 1995 U.S. 
Federal Budget will include 585 million U.S. dollars population 
control assistance, up from about 503 million dollars this year, 
press reports here said. 
  The U.S. is also teaming up with Japan to boost aid for 
population stabilization programs in poor countries. 
  When Japan's Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa visits 
Washington later next week, he and Clinton will announce an 
accord on population assistance. Japan is expected to commit 3 
billion dollars by the end of the decade for population programs 
and combating AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] in 
developing countries, an AP report quoted U.S. Government 
officials as saying. 
  Population experts project today's world population of 5.5 
billion will grow by 1 billion over the next decade, and double 
to 11 billion in 40 years. 
  By the year 2050, it will reach 12 billion, with more than 
90 
percent of the growth occurring in developing nations. 
  The present U.S. population of 259 million, growing at a 
slower rate, is projected to reach 392 million by the year 2050. 
  The Clinton administration has decided that stabilizing 
population is crucial to alleviating poverty and hunger. 
  The 1995 U.S. Federal Budget of around 1.5 trillion dollars 
will boost U.S. assistance to the U.N. Population Fund - which 
was cut off during the Reagan and Bush administrations - from 
the current 40 million dollars to 60 million dollars a year. 
  Wirth said that he hopes the U.S. population assistance to 
the U.N. Population Fund to top 1 billion dollars by the end of 
the decade. The goal is to ensure that every woman who wants 
family planning assistance can get it.

  [Text] Nicosia, February 4 (XINHUA) -- The fact that the 
rival Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities in Cyprus have 
accepted in principle a U.N. package of confidence building 
measures (CMBs) has created a unique opportunity, a U.S. 
official said here today. 
  Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special Cyprus 
coordinator, told a bicommunal press conference that he hoped 
the past week he had spent on the island would be "historic." 
  He said "we have a unique opportunity. No one sees the CMBs 
as an end in themselves. There is obviously more work to do. 
The solution is still in front of us," but the package "can lay 
the foundation stones." 
  U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali suggested last 
May 
a three-point peace plan, or confidence building measures. 
  The measures, aimed at building trust between the Greek and 
Turkish Cypriot communities, envisage the transfer of the 
Turkish- held fenced area of Famagusta to the U.N. 
Administration and reopening of the now defunct Nicosia 
International Airport. 
  Both sides on the island now accept the U.N. plan but have 
strong reservation over it. 
  Expressing his cautiousness, Lamb said, "The level of trust 
between the two sides is low, each side is skeptical about the 
other's commitment to the package." 
  He added that the "party leaders in the Greek Cypriot side 
are more negative this time than on the Turkish Cypriot side 
which is different from when I was here four months ago." 
  The message he sent to party leaders across the divided 
island was that "There may be things that you see are 
shortcomings, but this represents an opportunity." He 
described the package as "very positive and balanced." 
  However, asked about the problems he encountered this week, 
he said, "Frankly I came up with fewer difficulties than I 
expected," both President Glavkos Kliridhis and Turkish Cypriot 
leader Rauf Denktash showed willingness to discuss the package. 
  Lamb said, "There's been agreement on the principles and 
what 
we have to do now is to go through a process of refining these 
principles so that each side understands exactly what the other 
side expects from them," Lamb said. 
  On a timetable for the completion of the talks, the U.S. 
official said, "We don't want artificial deadlines ... [ellipses 
as received] We're not going to push either community to do 
something they are not comfortable with. On the other hand 
that's very different from delay," he said. 
  Local press reports said today U.N. Secretary General Ghali 
is about to send a letter to the leaders of the two communities, 
asking them to start indirect talks here in Nicosia on the peace 
plan. 
  The U.N.-sponsored peace talks, which have been on and off 
for nearly twenty years, have so far failed to yield any 
concrete results. 
  The island country has been divided into two parts since 
1974 
when Turkish troops intervened in northern Cyprus, with the 
Turkish Cypriots in the north and Greek Cypriots in the south. 
  The U.S. official is expected to leave the island today 
after 
one week's visit to the island.

  [Text] Washington, February 4 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. today 
described the Ukraine parliament's approval of the First 
Strategic Arms Treaty (Start One) and the related Lisbon 
Protocol as a major non-proliferation achievement. 
  "By approving the Lisbon Protocol, Ukraine is committed to 
accede to the Nonproliferation Treaty in the shortest possible 
time," said White House Spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers. 
  The U.S. comments came after Ukrainian lawmakers voted 260-3 
yesterday to remove conditions they had imposed for approving 
the start one treaty under which Kiev is required to give up all 
its nuclear warheads. 
  Under the agreement, Ukraine, now the world's third nuclear 
power, is to surrender more than 1,600 nuclear warheads 
inherited from the former Soviet Union. 
  "Although the lawmakers voted not to join the nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty for the time being, their support for 
start one and the Lisbon Protocol advances the security interest 
of both the United States and Ukraine and represents a major 
non- proliferation achievement," Myers said.

  [Text] Washington, February 6 (XINHUA) -- The United States 
has agreed to sell Argentina 36 warplanes with advanced radar 
technology in an effort to rearm the country's air force, it was 
reported here today. 
  The warplanes, built by the U.S. McDonnell Douglas 
Corporation, are called A4M Skyhawk jet attack planes, according 
to the NEW YORK TIMES. 
  The plane is regarded as a very effective in a dogfight 
because it has a small turning radius. 
  But State Department officials said the subsonic Skyhawks 
would be no match for the supersonic British Tornados stationed 
on the Falkland Islands and thus pose no threat to the security 
of the islands. 
  Of most importance to the United States was that the sale of 
the planes would help preserve the balance of power in the 
southern part of Latin America, the newspaper said. 
  The U.S. officials said that with the sale of the Skyhawks, 
Argentina, Brazil and Chile would have roughly equal air 
strength.

  [Text] Beijing, Feb 5 (AFP)--China, facing sanctions for 
not cracking down on trade in endangered species, seemed to have 
won some breathing space Saturday after a top international 
wildlife protection official said some progress had been made. 
  "We were very encouraged by what we saw," Murray Hosking, 
standing committee chairman of the UN Convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) told AFP. 
  However, Hosking, who left here Saturday after a four-day 
visit at the head of a CITES delegation, indicated that while 
the Chinese authorities had taken important steps to counter the 
illegal trade in rhinoceros horns and tiger bones, question 
marks remained over enforcement. 
  "The policing mechanisms they have set up are as good as 
any, 
but the important thing now is that they are seen to work," he 
said. 
  CITES launched a scathing attack on Taiwan and China in 
September for not enforcing restrictions and called on its 120 
members to consider punitive sanctions "up to and including the 
prohibition of trade in wildlife" against both. 
  China reponded in November by issuing a total ban on the 
trade in rhino horns and tiger bones, including their use in 
traditional Chinese medicine. 
  Although Hosking declined to give specific details of the 
delegation's findings, he described the report that he would 
take back to the CITES standing committee as "positive." 
  The committee will study the report before deciding whether 
to go ahead with the sanctions threat. 
  According to Hosking, China has agreed to carry out 
nationwide inspections of pharmaceutical companies and outlets 
this year and in 1995 to ensure the trade ban is being adhered 
to. 
  "The government must make sure that the policing is done 
visibly. Above all, it has to make it clear to the companies 
that it is serious," he said. 
  However, he acknowledged that the use of animal parts in 
Chinese medicine was a deeply ingrained tradition that would 
take time to break. 
  "You cannot change the cultural traditions of 1.2 billion 
people overnight."

  [Text] Beijing, February 5 (XINHUA) -- A senior Chinese 
official said here today that China will strengthen cooperation 
with international organizations, as well with countries where 
rhinos and tigers live, in its efforts to protect the endangered 
species from becoming extinct. 
  State Councillor Song Jian made the remarks to a visiting 
international delegation led by Murray Hosking, chairman of the 
Standing Committee of the Convention on International Trade in 
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). 
  The CITES delegation, which arrived here this week, 
inspected 
rhino horns and tiger bones sealed at a storehouse of a Beijing 
Chinese medicine factory yesterday and flew to Zhanjiang in 
Guangdong Province this afternoon to watch the burning of rhino 
horns tomorrow. 
  "China has lost two billion yuan since the Chinese 
Government 
banned the trade in rhino horns and tiger bones last year," Song 
said. 
  But he noted that it was necessary for the Chinese 
Government 
to take proper protection measures to save rhinos and tigers 
from becoming extinct. 
  "This policy is not only in line with the interests of 
Chinese people but will also benefit mankind as a whole," he 
said. 
  "It indicates that the Chinese Government has taken a firm 
and serious stand in implementing international conventions, and 
the international community should show its full understanding 
of it and give it the evaluation it deserves," he said. 
  "China has thousands of years of history of producing 
medicines from fauna and flora, while it has been only five 
years since it enforced the law to protect wild life," Song said. 
  "It is a gradual process in perfecting the laws and 
increasing the public's awareness of the importance of 
protecting wild life," he said. "You cannot expect to achieve 
all this overnight." 
  Song said that he hoped that the international community 
would understand the actual difficulties China is facing in 
protecting endangered species, as well as the Chinese 
Government's determination and achievements in protecting wild 
life. 
  "It will not help solve problems to put pressures on China 
and force China to do something which it is not able to do for 
the time being, disregarding the country's national conditions," 
Song said. 
  He added that China is completely open to the outside world 
in the area of environmental protection. "We welcome 
international organizations to send people to China to offer any 
criticism of our shortcomings and improve our work by giving 
their help and support." 
  Murray Hosking said that his delegation had clearly seen 
that 
China has taken resolute measures to protect wild life, and the 
country's legislative work in wild life protection was 
outstanding. 
  "We particularly appreciate China's open policy in wild life 
protection and the country has proved this in its policy banning 
the trade of rhino horns and tiger bones," he said. 
  The other members of the delegation expressed their 
appreciation of the sacrifice China's state-run medicine 
factories have made in implementing the government's policy 
banning all trade in rhino horns and tiger bones. 
  "I urge Chinese scientists to step up their research on the 
substances of the Chinese medicines and find substitutes for 
them as soon as possible," said Izgrev Topkov, a member of the 
delegation.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhou Shaoping (0719 1421 1627)] </F>
  [Text] Davos (Switzerland), 29 Jan (XINHUA) -- At a special 
session on China's economy of the annual World Economic Forum on 
29 January, Qi Huaiyuan, director of the State Council's Foreign 
Affairs Office, said: China sincerely hopes to increase 
cooperation with other countries and welcomes entrepreneurs from 
those countries to compete in its markets. 
  Qi Huaiyuan also noted: China hopes to resume its status as 
a GATT signatory at the earliest possible date. The solution of 
this problem will further promote the development of trade and 
economic cooperation between China and other countries on the 
basis of equality and mutual benefit, as well as strengthen the 
multilateral trade system. 
  The annual World Economic Forum, which opened in Davos on 27 
January, brought together 1,200 government leaders, 
entrepreneurs, bankers, and economists from various countries. 
Participants exchanged views on various economic topics. 
China's vibrant economy was one of the topics of interest to 
the participants. 
  Qi Huaiyuan also briefed participants on China's economy and 
reform at the special session on China's economy. He said: 
Over the past 15 years, China has greatly promoted the 
development of its productive forces as it has gradually 
implemented reform and opened wider to the outside world. Its 
gross national product [GNP] increased 12.8 percent in 1992, 
while the increase in 1993 was approximately 13 percent. He 
said emphatically: The Chinese Government has not stubbornly 
pursued double-digit, high rates of growth. Using complete 
projections, it has initially decided to maintain this year's 
GNP growth rate at 9 percent. 
  He pointed out: The goal of the Chinese Government is to 
maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy economic growth [chi xu 
kuai su jian kang zeng zhang 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 1073 
7022] in order to quadruple 1980's GNP by the turn of the 
century, and to help its people attain a fairly comfortable 
standard of living. The Chinese Government and people are fully 
confident of realizing this goal. 
  Speaking on foreign trade, Qi Huaiyuan said: Over the past 
15 years, China's foreign trade has consistently grown faster 
than its GNP, resulting in increasingly closer ties between 
China's economy and those of other parts of the world. China's 
total export and import volume rose from $20.64 billion in 1978 
to $195.72 billion in 1993, and it ranked 11th in the world in 
1992. China is no longer a huge potential market but rather a 
rapidly expanding market that has actually come into existence. 
  Qi Huaiyuan said: China is now in a period in which the old 
economic system is shifting to a new one, and the two systems 
are overlapping each other. Some deficiencies under the old 
system persist, while a new system has yet to take shape; this 
is the deep-seated cause of problems in China's economic 
operations. We must further deepen reform if we want to 
fundamentally solve this critical problem hindering China's 
economic development. In 1994, we will introduce a set of new 
major reform measures covering many important areas: 
state-owned enterprises, banking, finance, taxation, foreign 
trade, foreign exchange, and investment. The Chinese Government 
will ensure that each and every one of these reform measures 
will remain within the bounds of national strength and the 
people's means. 
  On foreign investment, Qi Huaiyuan pointed out: An important 
part of China's opening policy is to encourage foreigners to 
invest in China. By the end of October 1993, China had approved 
altogether 158,000 foreign-funded investment projects, with 
foreign capital actually invested in those projects totaling 
$51.7 billion. 
  He said: China is prepared to open its markets further; it 
also plans to allow foreign enterprises to join in the operation 
of those sectors from which foreigners were banned previously, 
such as power stations, railways, airports, and expressways. As 
reform of the economic system deepens, China's investment 
environment will improve.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by Zong Wen (1350 5113): "Impact of North </F>
American Free Trade Area on Asia"] 
  [Text] The North American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA], 
signed by the United States, Canada, and Mexico in August 1992, 
came into effect on 1 January 1994. NAFTA countries have a 
population of 360 million, GNP of $650 million, and an annual 
export volume of around $600 billion. In terms of economic 
strength and market scale, NAFTA exceeds the EC and ranks first 
in the world. Hence, it is bound to affect the economy of other 
parts of the world, including Asia. 
  The reaction of Asia, particularly East Asian nations and 
regions, to establishment of NAFTA is relatively complicated. 
On the one hand, as trade volume between the United States and 
East Asia accounts for one-third of each side's exports and the 
United States is one of the main investors in East Asia, the 
economic benefits brought by the free trade area to North 
America will also benefit Asia. On the other hand, the 
establishment of NAFTA will have an adverse influence on Asia's 
economy in the near future. According to the provisions of the 
NAFTA agreement, tariffs for most of the commodities of the 
three North American countries will be abolished within 5 to 10 
years while that of a small number of sensitive commodities will 
be abolished within 15 years. However, countries outside NAFTA 
have no right to enjoy such preferential treatment. This 
objectively produces a discriminative effect. The agreement 
also stipulates that over 65 percent of the component parts of 
the commodities enjoying preferential treatment must be produced 
within NAFTA countries. Such a provision concerning place of 
origin will restrict exports by other countries to the U.S. 
market. The development stage of Mexico's economy is similar to 
that of many East Asian countries. As it is adjacent to the 
United States and also enjoys favored tariffs for place of 
origin, it will be in a better position in competing with Asian 
products. Moreover, the United States will inevitably reduce 
its quotas to Asian countries in order to give more 
consideration to NAFTA. This will produce a great impact on 
Asian countries and regions, particularly the four "small Asian 
dragons" and ASEAN, which depend on the United States for their 
export trade. Their textiles, garments, toys, electronics, and 
other labor-intensive products will face a stern challenge in 
the North American market. As there are bright prospects for 
profits made in NAFTA, and Mexico has cheap labor and enjoys 
preferential treatment within the area, it will naturally 
attract some of the capital from the United States and even 
Europe and Japan. A number of traditional investors in Asia 
have transferred their investment from Asia to North America. 
  In the face of the new situation and challenge, Asian 
countries have also adopted relevant measures. 
  To bypass trade barriers, Japan and the newly rising 
industrial countries and regions in Asia are making use of 
preferential NAFTA policies to expand direct investment in the 
three North American countries, master scientific and 
technological information, and assimilate advanced U.S. 
scientific and technological achievements through enterprises 
there. While the NAFTA agreement was still under deliberation, 
Japan had already started making investment and running 
factories in the southern part of the United States. The 
Republic of Korea and other countries are also considering 
investment in Mexico so they may also have a foothold in the 
North American market. Apart from continuing their investment 
in the United States, East Asian countries will also increase 
their investment in Canada and Mexico. 
  The establishment of NAFTA will stimulate the readjustment 
of 
the industrial structure which is under progress in Asia, and 
impel Asian nations to offer more cheaper and better quality 
competitive products to take part in competition in the North 
American market. Japan will focus more attention on developing 
high-tech industries and industries that meet domestic needs. 
The "four small dragons" will mainly develop information and 
technology-intensive industries, making preparations for a new 
leap in their economies. Taking the opportunity of the 
production transfer in Japan and the "four small dragons," ASEAN 
nations will vigorously import capital and technology from these 
countries to develop intensive processing of primary products 
and other manufactures, and further realize industrialization. 
  A number of Asian nations and regions will promote pluralism 
of their economic ties and open up new channels of foreign 
capital and trade. With a drastic cut in U.S. investment, the 
Philippines will try to attract investment from Japan and other 
countries. East Asian nations will also adopt measures to 
gradually expand lateral exchanges within the region. 
  The establishment of NAFTA will also stimulate economic 
cooperation within the Asian region. The six ASEAN nations have 
decided to complete establishment of a free trade zone within 15 
years, the first free trade zone in Asia, which will reduce 
tariffs among the members to below 5 percent before the end of 
the century. The ASEAN has also decided to organize an "East 
Asian Economic Forum" as early as possible, which will exchange 
and explore a wider range of economic cooperation. Because of 
the diversity and varying development level of the Asian 
countries, the conditions for carrying out cooperation in a wide 
range and at a high level and for attaining economic integration 
are not yet ripe. Therefore, maintaining an open, flexible, and 
practical Asian economic consultation mechanism is obviously 
better than establishing a closed type economic group. 
  The establishment of NAFTA will further promote pluralism of 
the world economy and bring new opportunities and challenges for 
Asia's economy. 
  Thanks to the advantages of its domestic market and cheap 
labor, China's economy will not be affected in the short run. 
From a long- term point of view, however, the challenges must 
not be ignored. Meanwhile, East Asia, which includes China, is 
the region with the most dynamic economy in the world today. 
Hence, the establishment of NAFTA cannot change the focus of 
the world on East Asia.

<F P=106> ["Roundup": "Grand Forum on Technical Cooperation Among </F>
Developing Countries" by Gu Zhenqiu] 
  [Text] Lagos, February 4 (XINHUA) -- A five-day 
consultation on technical cooperation among developing countries 
(TCDC) concluded in the Nigerian capital of Abuja today with a 
total of 280 cooperation agreements having been reached. 
  Represented at the TCDC meeting were 26 countries from 
Africa, Asia and Latin America. A Chinese delegation also 
attended the meeting. 
  This is the first international conference held in Nigeria 
since the Abacha administration took over power in mid-November 
last year. 
  Initiated under the United Nations Development Program, the 
TCDC is aimed at promoting cooperation among developing 
countries. 
  At the opening ceremony, Nigerian Head of State General Sani 
Abacha said TCDC "is a means of promoting cultural and 
tech-nological exchanges among developing countries". 
  Abacha said the TCDC emerged as a new dimension in 
international cooperation for development which allowed 
developing countries to achieve national and collective 
self-reliance. 
  At the closing ceremony, Nigerian minister of national 
planning S.B. Daniyan described the TCDC as a means of national 
and regional growth and such cooperation is needed to address 
resource limitations in developing countries. 
  Reached by XINHUA on the phone, Huang Zhaohong, who headed 
the Chinese delegation to the meeting, said in Abuja that a 
total of 280 cooperation agreements were concluded by the end of 
the meeting. 
  China has reached 64 cooperation agreements with Benin, 
Cuba, 
Gambia, Nigeria and Thailand, said Huang, who is also economic 
and commercial counsellor in the Chinese Embassy in Nigeria. 
  With the Nigerian delegation alone, the Chinese delegation 
has signed 57 such agreements in agriculture, industry and 
technology. "This is the first time for China to have TCDC 
agreements with Nigeria," he said. 
  "The Chinese delegation ranks first in reaching cooperation 
agreements with other nations," he said. 
  In a speech delivered at the closing ceremony Li Wanming, a 
woman member of the Chinese delegation, said the Chinese 
Government attaches a great importance to cooperation among 
developing countries. 
  Meanwhile, she also spoke highly of the role of the United 
Nations Development Program [UNDP] in accelerating social and 
economic development in developing countries. 
  China began to take part in the UNDP activities in October 
1972. In September 1979, the UNDP set up a permanent 
representative office in China.

  [Text] Washington, February 7 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President 
Bill Clinton endorsed today a U.N. call for NATO approval of air 
strikes against those responsible for the Saturday [5 February] 
shelling in Sarajevo that killed 68 civilians and wounded 
hundreds of others. 
  He had long hoped U.N. authorization for military 
retaliation 
for atrocities on the Bosnian Muslim civilians, Clinton said in 
a speech in Houston, Texas. 
  Meanwhile, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said in 
addition to the specific request by U.N. secretary-general, NATO 
allies will discuss a range of options later this week in 
Brussels. 
  Christopher made the remarks after a meeting of senior 
Clinton advisors on the deteriorating situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  While responsibility for the Saturday attack, which led to 
the highest single civilian toll since war broke out in the 
Balkan Republic 22 months ago, Christopher said there was a 
strong presumption the the Bosnian Serbs were behind the attack. 
  He did not elaborate what other actions might be taken. 
  Christopher continued consultations with allied officials 
today. He had telephone conversations with foreign ministers of 
five countries, including Britain, France and Canada. 
  The bulk of the U.N. forces on humanitarian missions in 
Bosnia came from these three countries. 
  Clinton again echoed concerns of the countries over possible 
retaliation against their troops, criticizing some lawmakers 
that called for outright air strikes against the Bosnia Serbs. 
  They do not have electorate on the ground, Clinton said.

  [Text] Washington, February 5 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President 
Bill Clinton focused his Saturday [5 February] radio address on 
previewing his fiscal 1995 federal budget due to be released 
Monday. 
  Clinton said in his radio address today that his budget 
includes spending cuts in 300 programs, the outright elimination 
of 115 programs and a reduction of more than 100,000 federal 
workers. 
  Seven of 14 cabinet departments will get less money than in 
last year's budget, the President said. 
  Clinton is to unveil 1.5 trillion dollars budget Monday 
while 
in Houston, Texas. A barrage of budget briefings by top 
administration officials are also scheduled for Monday in 
Washington. 
  Clinton used most of the radio address to talk about the 
need 
to continue to create jobs for U.S. workers. 
  Clinton said in his first State of the Union address on 
January 25 that the U.S. private-sector produced 1.6 million 
jobs, more than the total in the previous four years, but added 
that many Americans are still looking for work while wage 
stagnation exists for a lot of employees. 
  The U.S. Labor Department announced Friday that the January 
jobless rate was 6.7 percent as against 6.4 percent in December, 
1993.

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Wang Nan: "Clinton's Choice Between </F>
Luxuries and Necessities"] 
  [Text] Washington, February 7 (XINHUA) -- From tree 
planting grants to cottonseed oil subsidies, from laser isotope 
separation project to space stations, the word now is "cut". 
  When President Clinton submitted the federal budget plan for 
fiscal 1995 to Congress today, the cuts in many of its spending 
programs will be the sharpest ever. 
  The 1.5 trillion U.S. dollars plan "is to prioritize 
programs, decide what we don't need and focus investments in the 
areas we think are important for the country," said Budget 
Director Leon Panetta. 
  In the plan, the Clinton administration proposed to cut 
spending from more than 300 federal programs, eliminate 115 
minor programs to save 3.25 billion dollars, and cut federal 
workforce by over 100,000. 
  The budget gave seven of the 14 cabinet departments less 
money to spend while investing more on high-tech, job creation, 
children education, worker training, crime fighting and 
protection of environment. 
  Inputs in areas like technology, for example, will be up 
about 40 percent, spending for primary schools will be slightly 
more. Some 2.7 billion dollars with regards to fighting crime 
are also added. 
  Congress republicans complained that there were only some 
minor changes in the new budget as compared with that of Former 
President George Bush. "But I still think it had teeth in it," 
said Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole. 
  "I think republicans ought to help the President in 
eliminating some of these programs," Dole said on Sunday [6 
February], although he, like other republican lawmakers, foresaw 
that some massaging will take place. 
  Observers predicted a lot of fire around the budget, which 
did not include, for example, the full effects of Clinton's two 
major proposals: welfare and health care reform, making it an 
incomplete presentation of all added costs. 
  "Both health care and welfare reform have profound budgetary 
and economic consequences," said Representative Alex Mcmillan, a 
republican from North Carolina, who called the missing 
"especially distressing." 
  The budget included tax increases on tobacco and business, 
and proposed cuts in Medicaid and Medicare, instead of the costs 
of some new entitlements and subsidies, observers noted. 
  "The budget is remarkable for what it's missing," Senate 
Minority Leader Bob Dole said. He said he was worried that the 
elimination of some programs might affect the low-income 
Americans. 
  The budget is controversial in three major cuts: urban mass 
transit subsidies, community development grants like public 
housing for the elderly, and subsidies for the poor to heat 
their homes, the last of which was protested in a letter signed 
by 51 senators. 
  The three have become "non-negotiable items," said Kweisi 
Mfume, a democratic representative from Maryland. He stressed 
that "there are other things to look at" when cuts are 
considered and compromises are made. 
  Explained Budget Director Leon Panetta, "We are pumping 
money 
on one end, and its not coming out the other end in terms of 
constructing public housing." 
  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the deficit 
will dip to 171 billion dollars this year and 166 billion 
dollars in the next fiscal year, but it will rise to over 300 by 
the year 2004. 
  "If we were not doing what we're doing, (the deficit) will 
be 
much higher," said Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen on Sunday. 
  Despite the efforts in deficit reduction, the total federal 
spending will continue to rise over the past five years by about 
23 percent, according to the bipartisan Congressional Budget 
Office.

<F P=106> [By Christine Chan] </F>
  [Text] Air China, one of China's three largest airlines, 
has ordered five Boeing jets, worth some U.S. $300 million [as 
published], to be delivered this year. 
  Company president Yin Wenlong said yesterday that the new 
planes would bring the Beijing-based airline's fleet to 66. 
Eight freighters were delivered last year. 
  Mr Yin said recent investment had put Air China in a 
position 
to repay leasing obligations worth 1.4 billion yuan (about 
HK$1.24 billion [Hong Kong dollars]) a year. 
  The first jet, a Boeing 747-400, is scheduled to be 
delivered 
by the end of this month. The 12-year lease financing 
agreement, worth U.S.$145 million, was signed yesterday. 
  The Export-Import Bank of Japan is providing 60 percent of 
the loan, while a group of banks including Mitsubishi Bank, 
Diamond Lease Co and Sanwa Bank is providing the rest. 
  Interest on the 60 per cent slice of the loan has been set 
at 
90 basis points above the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), 
and on the remainder at 120 basis points above LIBOR. 
  Mr Yin said the company, which deals with one-third of 
mainland air traffic, planned to expand to cope with the 
expected 20 percent annual growth in the market. 
  "We have ordered five Boeing jets for delivery this year. 
One Boeing 767 will be delivered in March, and one Boeing-737 
will be delivered in each of April, July and October," he said. 
  Five other Boeing jets would be bought for delivery next 
year. 
  Air China is one of the mainland's three largest airlines. 
The other two, China Southern Airlines and China Eastern 
Airlines, have become shareholding companies and have received 
approval to list abroad. 
  Mr Yin said Air China would do likewise, but would carry out 
the necessary restructuring first. 
  He said Air China, one of 55 enterprises chosen by Beijing 
to 
take part in modernisation experiments had set up a holding 
company in December last year. 
  Air China would now be one of 27 enterprises in the Air 
China 
Group. It is now operating on 58 domestic and 29 international 
routes. 
  Last year, its revenue totalled six billion yuan and flew 
1.5 
billion tonne-kilometres -- the measure used by the industry. 
  Taxed profit was more than 200 million yuan and gross profit 
700 million yuan. 
  Mr Yin forecasts revenue of nine billion yuan on traffic of 
1.8 billion tonne-kilometres this year. Taxed profits are 
expected to be about 300 million yuan.

  [Text] Beijing, February 7 (XINHUA) -- The General Motors 
Corporation (GM) and its two Chinese counterparts plan to set up 
a joint venture producing a new kind of motor engine controller. 
  The venture will produce 300,000 such controllers a year and 
the output could hit 600,000 when the market demand increases. 
  The new engine controlling system cuts fuel consumption by 5 
to 10 percent while decreasing waste gas by 60 to 90 percent, 
compared with the old system. 
  China has listed the system as a key national project in the 
Eighth Five-Year Plan period and the Ninth Five-Year Plan. 
  The two Chinese corporations are the Beijing Wanyuan 
Industrial Corporation and the Beijing Economic Investment and 
Development Corporation. 
  The new venture, Beijing Wanyuan-General Motor 
Electronic-Control Co. Ltd., will start with a 30 million U.S. 
dollar investment, to be followed by another 120 million U.S. 
dollars. 
  The new venture will use the technology of the American 
vehicle manufacturing giant.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by staff reporter Chang Shao-wei (1728 </F>
1421 1218): "China and the United States Increase Cooperation 
in Cracking Down on Crimes"] 
  [Text] "The Chinese and U.S. Governments have clear 
differences in terms of human rights, missile proliferation, and 
trade methods and we neither deny nor ignore them. However, 
since internationalized crime poses a common threat to both our 
countries, we are making joint efforts to face squarely the 
common interests we have on this issue." 
  That is the view aired by Robert Gelbard, U.S. assistant 
secretary of state for international narcotics matters, in a 
speech in Hong Kong yesterday. It was precisely for this reason 
that Gelbard recently led a high-level delegation to China to 
seek increased cooperation in cracking down on crime. 
  Since President Jiang Zemin and President Clinton met last 
November, Sino-U.S. relations have further improved. Gelbard's 
trip proves that, as two big powers, China and the United States 
have many spheres of cooperation. With the rise in 
international organized crime, the focus of the crackdown has 
shifted to how to get more information to accurately deal a 
crushing blow from top to bottom at transnational crime 
syndicates. This makes it necessary for the law-enforcement 
departments of various countries to work with good cooperation. 
  In his speech, Gelbard described how transnational organized 
crime syndicates carry out illegal activities with advanced 
weapons, telecommunications, and transport facilities, as well 
as monetary means. He said: "If the boss of an Asian syndicate 
enterprise wants to fix up a kidnapping case in New York, he can 
order his subordinate in New Jersey by directly dialing his 
subordinate's mobile telephone number using satellite 
telecommunications equipment. Afterward, they can make contact 
again by coded fax. If funds are needed, the money can be 
remitted to the United States electronically, possibly through a 
Hong Kong bank. The ransom can also be remitted to a bank in 
the Bahamas, then sent again from there to Panama, eventually 
arriving in a numbered Swiss bank account. The entire process 
can be completed in one day." 
  This description is like the plot of a movie but it is 
really 
shocking, especially the fact that what has been revealed is 
only the tip of the iceberg. Given such modern methods of 
committing crime, it has become even more difficult to crack 
down on crime. 
  Gelbard pointed out that half the drugs on the U.S. market 
come from Asia. 
  With the opening up of the country, the economic 
development, 
and the influx of Western ideas, various different factors have 
contributed to the resurrection of drug-taking in China, where 
it had disappeared for decades. The drug-trafficking activities 
through China's long borders have also become increasingly 
rampant. The crime syndicates in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the 
United States not only smuggle drugs to other countries through 
the Chinese mainland but also smuggle "human cargo" to the 
United States in a big way, making it more urgent for China and 
the United States to jointly crack down on such organized crime. 
  As a financial and information center, Hong Kong is 
naturally 
regarded by the international crime syndicates as a paradise for 
money laundering and a supreme headquarters for mobilizing and 
organizing various criminal activities. What is needed now is 
for the world's law-enforcement authorities to make joint 
efforts to crack down on the frenzied criminal activities. It 
is gratifying that such joint efforts are being stepped up. 
Gelbard said that from his talks with Chinese officials he had 
got the impression that the Chinese side approached 
drug-trafficking and other issues very seriously and 
conscientiously and that Sino-U.S. cooperation would be further 
strengthened. His successful visit to China also shows that 
through their joint efforts China and the United States can more 
effectively crack down on crimes and safeguard people's security 
and social stability.

  [Text] Washington, February 7 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President 
Bill Clinton proposed today to cut 181,000 uniformed and 
civilian defense personnel in fiscal year 1995 that begins 
October 1. 
  The cut, contained in the 1.5 trillion dollars fiscal 1995 
budget, would lead the U.S. Military to an active force of 1.52 
million people. 
  That includes 510,000 for the Army, 442,000 for the Navy, 
174,000 for the Marine Corps and 400,000 for the Air Force. 
  Although the 1995 budget for national defense increases to 
263.7 billion dollars from 260.9 billion dollars this year, real 
spending would actually decline 0.9 percent if projected 
inflation elements were taken into account. 
  That decline is far from the 5.9 percent real drop planned 
for 1996 under the Clinton administration's five-year spending 
plan, representing its intention to hold the line on overall 
spending. 
  The 1995 defense budget includes 252.2 billion dollars for 
the Department of Defense, 10.6 billion dollars for nuclear 
weapons programs of the Department of Energy and 900 million 
dollars for other defense-related spending. 
  It includes 2.8 billion dollars for the closing of military 
bases, 5.7 billion dollars for environmental cleanup and 
pollution prevention at military facilities, 5 billion dollars 
for military construction and 3.3 billion dollars for military 
housing. 
  Reflecting the military "bottom-up review" conducted under 
former Defense Secretary Les Aspin that stresses readiness, the 
1995 budget gives an increase of 1.7 billion dollars for 
readiness in real terms.

<F P=106> ["U.S. Uses Submarines for Deep-Sea Spying"] </F>
  [Text] New York, February (XINHUA) -- The United States 
Navy has long had secret submarines for deep-sea spying, it was 
reported here today. 
  For decades, the U.S. Navy has operated fleet of specially 
equipped submarines whose secret work is to comb deep waters for 
military intelligence virtually unobtainable by any other means, 
THE NEW YORK TIMES said today. 
  These spy submarines, as experts in naval warfare said, are 
the Navy's counterpart to reconnaissance satellites, but better 
in some respects. 
  They said such submarines can not only examine distant 
objects on the ocean floor, but also in some cases retrieve or 
manipulate them. 
  The objects of interest include lost ships, submarines, 
planes, weapons, rockets, spacecraft and nuclear warheads, as 
well as functioning equipment, like other countries' undersea 
cables and devices, THE TIMES reported. 
  "A vivid example of the spying technique was recently given 
to Congress by a former senior Navy official who disclosed an 
early mission of one of these submarines, the Halibut, to 
examine a sunken Soviet submarine in the Pacific in 1968," the 
newspaper noted. 
  The naval experts, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 
the Halibut was the first in a series of these submarines, which 
actually constitute a new class of American submarine designed 
to lower gear-laden cables for deep reconnaissance, recovery and 
manipulation.

<F P=106> [By Liu Wenzong (0491 2429 1350), Foreign Affairs College </F>
International Law Research Institute professor: "Chris Patten's 
Long-Standing Scheme `To Expand Democracy in Hong Kong'--Chris 
Patten's `Constitutional Reform Proposal' as Viewed From the 
`Countdown to 1997' Report"] 
  [Text] Chris Patten has put forward his "constitutional 
reform proposal" on the pretext of "expanding democracy in Hong 
Kong." This has given people the wrong impression, as if only he 
wants to develop "democracy" in Hong Kong. He even asked: 
"What is wrong with expanding democracy?" and "Why is China 
opposed to it?" In fact, he feigns ignorance. As everyone 
knows, over the past 150 years the British Empire has not 
allowed Hong Kong people to enjoy democracy. Why is it so 
interested in "democracy" now? There must be more to this than 
meets the eye. 
<H3>  I. From Margaret Thatcher's Original Concept to Chris 
Patten's "Constitutional Reform Proposal" </H3>
  As far back as the early 1980's, the then British Prime 
Minister Mrs. Thatcher had a concept, which was: "We should 
develop Hong Kong's democratic structure. Our objective is to 
allow Hong Kong to become independent or practice self-rule 
within a short period of time.... This makes it necessary to 
set up in Hong Kong a government with more distinctive Chinese 
characteristics in which Britain will increasingly become 
subordinate. We also should possibly consider a referendum as 
an acceptable system there" (see Margaret Thatcher's memoirs 
"The Downing Street Years"). This passage clearly shows that 
Britain has long wanted to turn Hong Kong into an independent or 
semi-independent political entity to continue the British rule 
there in a disguised form after 1997. However, given the firm 
stand of the Chinese Government and people that all sovereignty 
over Hong Kong must be recovered in 1997, she had to retreat and 
eventually agree to sign the "Sino-British Joint Declaration on 
the Question of Hong Kong" and other relevant agreements. The 
joint declaration explicitly stipulates: "The Chinese 
Government has decided to resume the exercise of sovereignty 
over Hong Kong with effect from 1 July 1997." "The Government 
of the United Kingdom declares that it will restore Hong Kong to 
the PRC with effect from 1 July 1997." At the joint declaration 
signing ceremony, Mrs. Thatcher also solemnly announced: "I 
pledge that the British Government will do its best to make the 
agreement a success." The signing and ratification of the 
"Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong" 
has delivered the whole territory of Hong Kong from British 
colonial rule and set it down permanently as China's territory 
in terms of law. After the Hong Kong Basic Law was promulgated, 
the British Foreign Office issued a statement of confirmation, 
calling it an "important milestone." Subsequently, on many 
occasions, the British side has also pledged to cause Hong 
Kong's constitutional development to converge with the Basic Law. 
  However, with the approach of 1997 and unwilling to withdraw 
from the historical stage, the British Government has suddenly 
made a U-turn in its stand toward the question of Hong Kong and, 
through the new Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten, dished out the 
"three violations" "constitutional reform proposal." The "three 
violations" refers to violation of the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration, the relevant agreements and understandings reached 
between China and Britain, and the principle agreed upon by both 
parties of the convergence of Hong Kong's political system and 
the Basic Law. 
  It should be pointed out that before Chris Patten took up 
his 
post as Hong Kong governor in July 1992, a "Mission to Hong Kong 
By the International Jurists Commission" headed by William 
Goodhart of Britain, engaged in extensive activities in Hong 
Kong in June 1991. After returning to Britain, the delegation 
wrote a 100,000-word report entitled "Countdown to 1997--Report 
of a Mission to Hong Kong" (hereinafter the "Report"). 
Reviewing the British Hong Kong policy from politics, law, and 
other aspects, the "Report" launched an all-out attack on the 
Basic Law and, in conclusion, put forward 45 "conclusions and 
suggestions." Whoever leafs through the "Report," especially 
its "conclusions and suggestions," can see that Britain has 
never given up the aforesaid original concept of Mrs. Thatcher. 
That is the fundamental reason why the Chinese and British 
Governments have failed to reach any agreement despite 17 rounds 
of talks, held between 22 April and 27 November 1993, on the 
question of the 1994 and 1995 electoral arrangements in Hong 
Kong. 
<H3>  II. "Countdown to 1997" Provides a "Reform Prototype" for 
Patten's "Constitutional Reform" </H3>
  To better understand the contents and objectives of Patten's 
"constitutional reform proposal," it is necessary to examine it 
in tandem with the "Report." 
  First of all, the "Report" reviews the greatest error in the 
British Hong Kong policy, holding that "before holding talks on 
and before signing the joint declaration," the British 
Government should have held a `referendum' in Hong Kong, and 
that it also "gave open, customary, indolent, and tacit consent" 
to the Basic Law (see "Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 5 and p 
115 of the original report). On this count, the authors say 
with great sympathy: "Given the current situation, it is no 
longer practical to exercise the right to self-determination 
effectively." ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 7). What, 
then, is to be done? The authors suggest that, first, we 
"should replace the 18 appointed Legislative Councillors whose 
terms of office end at the end of 1993 with directly elected 
councillors from 18 geographical constituencies" ("Conclusions 
and Suggestions" No. 15) and "implement an overall geographical 
constituency electoral system in the 1995 Legislative Council 
[Legco] elections" ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 13). In so 
doing, the authors have completely abolished the functions of 
functional constituencies and the Election Committee in the 1994 
and 1995 elections as agreed by both parties, deliberately 
violated the provision of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region [SAR] that the SAR's first Legco should be 
composed proportionately of councillors elected by functional 
groups, those elected through the Election Committee, and those 
directly elected in geographical constituencies, and violated 
the commitment repeatedly made by Britain that the Hong Kong 
constitutional development should converge with the Basic Law. 
This is absolutely identical with what Patten is doing now. 
  What is particularly interesting is that the "Report" 
authors had long expected that in doing so there would probably 
be no "through train." But the "Report" categorically states: 
"The benefit of the `through train' to Hong Kong is not the 
most important one and should not be taken as a reason for 
giving up comprehensive democratic elections in 1995" 
("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 16). You may well see how 
harmonious they are with each other. Readers are likely to ask: 
Since there is no `through train,' what is the point of the 
British Hong Kong authorities insisting on such an election as 
suggested in the "Report"? In fact, there is great 
significance. Mrs. Thatcher has laid bare the secret with her 
aforesaid remarks. In truth, they want to make Britain 
"subordinate" in the remaining 2 to 3 years and produce a Legco 
fully elected by Hong Kong compatriots to pursue a series of 
"reforms" in opposition to the Basic Law and thus create chaos 
and undermine Hong Kong's prosperity, stability, and peaceful 
transition. In doing so they can fish in troubled waters and 
even stage a comeback someday. 
  We can have a complete understanding of this point if we 
look 
at the series of "suggestions" listed in the "Report." First, 
the "Report" directs the spearhead of its attack at the 
relationship between the central people's government and the 
future Hong Kong SAR. It is opposed to the provision in the 
Basic Law that the chief executive is to be appointed by the 
central people's government, calling for a "chief executive 
directly elected by the masses" or "making a choice between a 
directly elected chief executive and a directly elected 
government" ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 17); says that 
"the chief executive should be responsible to the SAR 
legislature" rather than "responsible to the PRC" ("Conclusions 
and Suggestions" No. 18); and calls for "restricting the 
provision that the courts of Hong Kong shall have no 
jurisdiction over acts of state such as defense and foreign 
affairs" ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 19) as laid down in 
Article 19 of the Basic Law. It also negates the role of the 
Basic Law as the future SAR's constitution, claiming that the 
power of interpretation of whether the clauses of the Basic Law 
are applicable to the SAR and whether Hong Kong laws contravene 
the Basic Law "should be shifted from the National People's 
Congress [NPC] Standing Committee to the Hong Kong courts" 
("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 20). They have made a clean 
breast of their intentions in those few points. We should like 
to ask: If the chief executive is neither appointed by, nor 
responsible to, the central people's government but is only 
responsible to the Hong Kong legislature; if the right of 
adjudication and the right of interpretation of such things as 
whether the laws formulated by the Hong Kong legislature 
contravene the Basic Law and whether the clauses of the Basic 
Law are applicable to the SAR are not vested in the NPC Standing 
Committee but in Hong Kong courts, will not Hong Kong turn into 
a political entity completely independent of the central 
people's government? What is there in common with Hong Kong as 
an SAR of the PRC? Will not the provision in the "Sino-British 
Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong" that the "PRC 
has decided to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong 
with effect from 1 July 1997" come to naught? 
  Although Chris Patten still dares not make such suggestions, 
he has spread the news that "before and after 1997 
administrative work should be responsible to the legislature." 
What a phrase "before and after 1997" is! This is by no means 
a slip of the tongue. If the Hong Kong executive organ is 
responsible only to the Hong Kong legislature after 1997, will 
this not coincide with the aforesaid suggestion in the "Report"? 
<H3>  III. Let's See What Actions Chris Patten Will Take in the 
Next 2 to 3 Years? </H3>
  In addition to making "suggestions" about the 1994 and 1995 
elections and the relationship between the future chief 
executive and legislature and the central people's government, 
which are totally out of keeping with the Basic Law, the 
"Report" also sets a keynote for the "reforms" Patten should 
accomplish in the next 2 to 3 years. 
  People know that even though Hong Kong compatriots have 
acquired "British Dependent Territories Citizens" [BDTC] status 
in the past, it is very difficult for them to secure British 
nationality and the right of abode in Britain. Contrary to 
previous practice, the "Report" authors now suggest that as 
regards all BDTCs in Hong Kong: "No matter what practical 
difficulties it has, Britain has in principle the obligation to 
let them enjoy the right of abode in Britain proper or an 
acceptable third country" ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 9). 
Why do they make such a suggestion? Because it was stipulated 
in the "British Memorandum on the 1984 Sino-British Joint 
Declaration" that all persons who are BDTCs before 30 June 1997 
"will cease to be BDTCs with effect from 1 July 1997" "without 
conferring the right of abode in the United Kingdom." It is 
also stipulated in the Chinese Memorandum that "under the 
Nationality Law of the PRC, all Hong Kong Chinese compatriots, 
whether they are holders of `BDTC' Passports' or not, are 
Chinese nationals." Obviously, the "Report" authors hold that 
such a practice will considerably reduce Britain's influence in 
Hong Kong after 1997. Originally, China and Britain had reached 
initial agreement on the nationality and right of abode of BDTCs 
and this has been overthrown by the "Report" authors. 
  The "Report" suggests: "The Hong Kong BDTCs of non-Chinese 
origin who have no right of abode outside Hong Kong should be 
immediately granted British nationality and right of abode in 
Britain" ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 10); the Hong Kong 
BDTCs of Chinese origin, including those who applied for 
naturalized BDTC after the signing of the joint declaration on 
19 December 1984, should be given right of abode ("Conclusions 
and Suggestions" No. 11); and that the deadline for going 
through such a procedure may be extended to six years after the 
transition of Hong Kong sovereignty in 1997 and can be further 
extended if necessary ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 12). 
Very obviously, in making such suggestions, the "Report" 
authors want to rope in large numbers of Hong Kong people, 
encouraging them to have a free hand in acting according to 
Britain's will before and after 1997. If they should finally 
find it really impossible to muddle along they need not worry as 
they have a place of retreat in Britain. 
  In addition, the "Report" also takes "human rights" as an 
important weapon against the exercise of sovereignty over Hong 
Kong by the PRC. The "Report" especially stresses the 
importance of the British Parliament formulating the 
"Regulations for Implementing the Bill of Rights" and placing 
them above the Basic Law. It claims that they should not be 
rescinded or restricted even after 1997 ("Conclusions and 
Suggestions" No. 34) and that, if all or some of the current 
statutes contravene the regulations, they should be rescinded or 
amended ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 33). Obviously, the 
"Report" authors seem to forget that the British Hong Kong 
Government's rule over Hong Kong will expire on 30 June 1997 and 
that the legal basis for maintaining their power after that date 
will disappear. By that time, "the system, policies, and laws 
practiced after the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR will be 
based on the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR" (Resolution from 
the Third Session of the Seventh NPC); "the law previously in 
force in Hong Kong, that is, the common law, rules of equity, 
ordinances, subordinate legislation, and customary law shall be 
maintained, except for any that contravene this law and subject 
to any amendment by the legislature of the Hong Kong SAR" 
(Article 8 of the Basic Law). We should like to ask, is there 
any reason to place the regulations formulated by the British 
Parliament above the Basic Law and extend their validity beyond 
1997 without subjecting them to examination? The "Report" 
authors also suggest that, before 1997, it is necessary to 
"spare no effort in implementing" the regulations ("Conclusions 
and Suggestions" No. 35); "set up a powerful Human Rights 
Commission" in Hong Kong ("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 37); 
and that "Britain should accept the jurisdiction of the 
`Optional Protocol on the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights' on behalf of Hong Kong" ("Conclusions and 
Suggestions" No. 42). It even suggests that "the International 
Jurists Commission or the International Federation of Human 
Rights Organizations should speedily set up an independent body 
to supervise progress in Hong Kong's human rights situation" 
("Conclusions and Suggestions" No. 41) and so on. Obviously, 
using "human rights" to interfere in another country's internal 
affairs is a special weapon of hegemonists in recent years and 
the "Report" authors do not forget to use it either. Hong Kong 
compatriots should rest assured that, in line with the Basic 
Law, all Hong Kong compatriots will enjoy much fuller human and 
civil rights than they have done during the rule by the British 
Empire. Naturally, if a small number of people who, with 
ulterior motives, take advantage of human rights to engage in 
sabotage activities in a vain attempt to pull Hong Kong onto the 
path of independence and separation, this will be impermissible 
under the Basic Law and will not be tolerated by the future Hong 
Kong SAR. As everybody knows, as far back as 1982 when starting 
talks with Britain on the future of Hong Kong, the Chinese 
Government explicitly stated: After resuming sovereignty over 
Hong Kong, China will pursue the principles and policies of "one 
country, two systems, `Hong Kong people running Hong Kong,' and 
"a high degree of self-autonomy." After 1997, Hong Kong will 
practice immeasurably better democracy than that under British 
rule. Over the past 100 years and more, the governor has always 
arrogated all authority to himself and there has been absolutely 
no democracy to speak of in Hong Kong. 
  As stated above, the "Report," which is entitled 
"Countdown," 
helps people, to a certain extent, understand Britain's current 
and future policies toward Hong Kong, as well as Patten's 
"constitutional reform proposal." People will wait and see how 
Patten acts next. 
<H5>  IV. Concluding Remarks </H5>
  Hong Kong bears witness to the history of colonial 
aggression 
in which the Western colonialists were the first to open China's 
gate and the last to leave China. The fact that the Chinese 
nation has suffered humiliation and oppression at the hands of 
Western powers over the past 150 years has something to do with 
this. The day to thoroughly cleanse all remnants of colonialism 
in China will finally arrive soon. At this historical juncture, 
as the elite of Hong Kong society, Legco members who assume 
heavy historical responsibility, should first stand out and 
boycott Patten's "constitutional reform proposal" so that all 
his plans will come to naught. Only in this way can they have a 
clear conscience toward their forefathers and future 
generations. All Hong Kong compatriots loving the motherland 
should fight in unity and make persistent efforts to boycott all 
"separate elections" Chris Patten may launch. Let Patten and 
his like "count down" because their countdown can only result in 
"zero," while before us is a more thriving and prosperous Hong 
Kong and a more thriving and prosperous great motherland. With 
hands and hearts linked together, let us usher in the arrival of 
the great historical date of 1 July 1997!

  [Text] Macao, February 7 (XINHUA) -- Chinese 
Communications Minister Huang Zhendong said that the 
construction of the Macao International Airport is of great 
significance and it will play an important role in promoting the 
economic development and political stability in the area. 
  Huang made these remarks in an interview with XINHUA before 
he left Macao this morning. 
  He said, the airport is the largest communications project 
in 
Macao's history. The completion of the airport will greatly 
improve Macao's investment environment and enhance local 
economic prosperity. 
  He added, the airport will also bring more benefits to local 
residents, who have dreamed to have their own airport for 
generations. 
  Huang said, at present, Macao's communications connection 
with overseas places is mainly through Hong Kong and now there 
are more through China's mainland. 
  With the completion of the airport, people can come to and 
leave Macao directly, he said, adding this to some extent will 
improve Macao's international status. 
  He pointed out, Macao airport is an unprecedented large 
scale 
project in terms of its design, research, overall management as 
well as degree of difficulty in construction. 
  However, Huang noted, China Harbor Engineering Company has 
worked hard to guarantee the smooth process of the project. He 
added that he was told that both Macao Government officials and 
people from all walks of life are all satisfied with the process 
and quality of the airport project. 
  Huang said, it can be said that the construction of the 
Macao 
International Airport is a great contribution the China Harbor 
Engineering Company has made to the strengthening of friendly 
cooperation between China and Portugal and to the maintenance of 
Macao's social stability and economic prosperity during the 
transitional period.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 8 (CNA) -- The Dalai Lama is expected 
to visit Taiwan in May or October in his capacity as a religious 
leader, an elder brother of the Tibetan spiritual leader 
announced at a news conference late Monday [7 February]. 
  Gyalo Thundup, who led a four-member Tibetan group here, 
said 
that the Dalai Lama will meet with President Li Teng-hui, 
Premier Lien Chan, other ranking government officials, and 
religious leaders during his stay in Taiwan. 
  The Dalai Lama, who has received a letter each from 
President 
Li and Premier Lien, admired Taiwan's political and economic 
achievements made during the past four decades, Thundup noted. 
  A possible visit by the Tibetan spiritual leader has stirred 
great interest here since Chao Tze-chi, chairman of the World 
League for Freedom and Democracy, extended a formal invitation 
in 1992. 
  On Beijing's possible reaction, Thundup said that the Dalai 
Lama paid no mind to Mainland China's views toward his planned 
visit to Taiwan, nor did Beijing express opposition to the 
visit. Currently, he pointed out, the Tibetan 
government-in-exile makes frequent contacts with mainland 
authorities. 
  The Dalai Lama has headed the Tibetan Government-in-Exile 
since 1959 when he fled Lhasa, Tibet's capital city. Communist 
Chinese troops launched military campaigns against Tibet in 1949 
and occupied the land in 1951. 
  Meanwhile, Thundup noted, Premier Lien has given the green 
light to the establishment of a liaison office in Taipei by the 
exiled government. The exact time for the office's opening, 
however, has yet to be worked out, he added. 
  The soon-to-be-established liaison office, aiming to 
strengthen cultural exchanges, will be similar to other offices 
around the world, he said. 
  Thundup, who studied at National Chengchi University in the 
1940's and speaks fluent Mandarin, left for home Tuesday morning. 
  Chang Chun-yi, chairman of the cabinet-level Mongolian and 
Tibetan Affairs Commission, said that the government, while 
welcoming the Dalai Lama's visit, is deeply concerned about the 
Tibetans in exile. 
  Statistics show that there are 120,000 exiled Tibetans in 
India, 20,000 in Nepal, 8,000 in Sikkim, and 4,000 in Bhutan. 
  "We hope to work out with the Dalai Lama a solution to the 
problems facing the Tibetan exiles such as education and health 
care," Chang stressed.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 8 (CNA) -- Taipei chief negotiator 
Chiao Jen-ho said Tuesday [8 February] that both Taiwan and 
Mainland China were winners at the recently completed 
cross-strait talks in Beijing because they both, to some extent, 
attained their objectives. 
  At the beginning of the talks, the highest level 
cross-strait 
negotiations since the Koo-Wang talks in Singapore in April, 
both sides made clear their bottom lines: Taipei wanted Beijing 
to accept the reality of its sovereignty, while Beijing insisted 
Taiwan recognize the "one-China" principle and agree that 
Taiwan's ability to exercise jurisdiction was a political issue 
and therefore not one to be touched on during the talks. 
  The talks deadlocked over the sovereignty problem, leading 
to 
a cancellation of discussions on the issues at hand -- the 
repatriation of mainland hijackers and illegal immigrants and 
the resolution of cross-strait fishing disputes -- during the 
third of five days of talks. 
  But after an hour-and-a-half meeting between Chiao and Wang 
Zaoguo, the head of the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office, 
the talks were given an unexpected impetus, enabling negotiators 
to clear away some long-standing obstacles and arrive at a "high 
degree of consensus" at the end of the talks, although no 
concrete agreements were reached. 
  "Having the consensus is a win-win result," Chiao, the 
secretary-general of the Straits Exchange Foundation, said. 
  "We already have Taiwan's sovereignty properly respected by 
the other side," Chiao said, citing Beijing's preliminary 
agreement with Taiwan over the issue of mainland hijackers. 
Beijing has promised that any hijackers repatriated to the 
mainland would have their time served in Taiwan deducted from 
any sentence given by a mainland court. 
  Chiao also pointed to Beijing's approval of the enforcement 
power of arbitration agencies to be set up on both sides to 
handle fishing disputes as another example of Beijing's 
acquiescence to Taiwan's sovereignty. 
  But Zhou Zhekai, secretary-general of the Association for 
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait and the No. 2 mainland 
negotiator, said that the mainland didn't give in to Taiwan on 
the sovereignty issue. "We didn't mention the sovereignty; we 
just dealt with the reality itself," he said. 
  Chiao's counterpart, ARATS Standing Vice President and chief 
mainland negotiator Tang Shubei, reiterated that the sovereignty 
issue is a part of politics and should be avoided. "Avoidance 
of the jurisdiction problem means that we will not mention it in 
the wordings of future agreements," he added. 
  If Tang and Zhou are correct, then Taipei might not have 
gotten what it wanted. On the contrary, Beijing took more from 
the talks. 
  First, it received Taipei's promise to list cross-strait 
trade, economic, cultural and technical cooperation on the 
agenda of the next round of cross-strait talks scheduled for 
March in Beijing. Taipei originally insisted that it would not 
touch those issues until its request that its jurisdiction 
regarding the issues of hijackers, illegal immigrants and 
fishing disputes be recognized. 
  Secondly, Chiao's meeting with Wang created an image that 
high- level contacts are more efficient in solving the 
complicated issues, so Beijing can now justify its longstanding 
call that cross-strait high-level political talks take place 
sooner rather than later.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 5 (CNA) -- Police announced Saturday 
[5 February] the breaking up of what is believed to be the 
largest arms smuggling ring ever in Taiwan. 
  Police arrested 23 people and seized 56 handguns and are 
checking on the whereabouts of 3,000 other guns believed to have 
been smuggled into Taiwan by the group over the past two years. 
  The arrested ringleaders of the group include Wang 
Hai-sheng, 
44, who was in charge of the group's finances; Liu San-chu, 41, 
the group's marketing expert; Yin Ching-lin, 39, and Wang 
Jung-chang, 34. 
  Initial investigations show that the group illegally brought 
into Taiwan 3,000 guns and 18,000 rounds of ammunition in seven 
shipments from 1992 through 1993. The shipments were labeled as 
either electrical appliances or sporting goods to fool customs.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 7 (CNA) -- A Defense Ministry official 
apologized to the country Monday [7 February] for the unfolding 
arms purchase scandal, which has shrouded the military in a 
cloud of corruption. 
  Lt. Gen. Shih Tzuo-ching, deputy director of the Political 
Warfare Department of the Ministry of National Defense, told a 
press conference that because of the malfeasance of a handful of 
officers, "the military's image has been marred and the nation's 
interest harmed." 
  Several military officers and arms brokers have been 
detained 
for being involved in the murder of Navy Captain Yin Ching-feng, 
whose body was uncovered on Dec. 10. Yin was responsible for 
the navy's arms acquisition unit. 
  The ministry organized a special task force a week after 
Yin's body was discovered, but doubts over the role of the ad 
hoc group have since mounted because little progress has been 
reported in clearing the web of irregularities surrounding the 
incident. 
  Shih denied rumors that the military has been trying to keep 
a low profile on the case because many more ranking officers 
have been implicated. "No direct evidence is available that can 
lead to some suspects being charged," he said. 
  While pledging to bring the case to its just conclusion, 
Shih 
said the Defense Ministry is reviewing its arms procurement 
system to prevent similar scandals in the future.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 7 (CNA) -- Koo Chen-fu, chairman of 
the Chinese National Association of Industry and Commerce, urged 
domestic manufacturers Monday [7 February] to become 
self-reliant in high technology to help Taiwan decrease its 
dependence on Japan. 
  Koo made the remarks at a meeting of an Economics 
Ministry-sponsored task force that is studying ways to decrease 
the deficit with Japan. 
  Koo said the time for using tax exemptions to stimulate 
investment is over, and that Taiwan must now establish 
independence in high technology in order to get the economy in 
gear. 
  Vice Economic Affairs Minister Sheu Ke-sheng said at the 
meeting that the deficit with Japan can be cut by an industrial 
structure upgrade and by domestic manufacturers producing higher 
quality products in order to tempt Japanese buyers. 
  Hsu said, however, that domestic manufacturers must get over 
their mindset that Taiwan's industries are too weak and reliant 
on Japanese imports of key components and machinery. Until this 
happens, he said, the trade deficit with Japan will continue.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 5 (CNA) -- In an effort to prevent 
foreign investors from totally controlling public enterprises, 
the Ministry of Economic Affairs has announced that foreigners 
will be allowed to own a maximum of 40 percent of any public 
enterprise. 
  Since the government decided to proceed actively with the 
privatization of state-owned concerns to assure continued growth 
and profitability, many foreign firms have been showing strong 
interest in acquiring them. 
  A large Japanese construction firm recently offered a meaty 
price for BES Engineering Corp., but was turned away when BES 
declared the bidding closed to foreigners. 
  The Economics Ministry has targeted Taiwan Machinery 
Manufacturing Corp., Chung Hsin Electric &amp; Machinery Mfg. 
Corp. 
and China Petrochemical Development Corp. for privatization 
before the end of June. Following suit will be Taiwan 
Fertilizer Co., Ltd., Taiwan Power Company, China Steel Corp., 
China Shipbuilding Corp., Taiwan Sugar Corp., and many others 
  Vice Economic Affairs Minister Yang Shih-chien said recently 
that given the vital role many public enterprises play in the 
public's daily life, his ministry will hold firm to its decision 
that public enterprises be kept under the control of Taiwan 
shareholders while they undergo privatization. 
  Sticking to this view is Taiwan Machinery Manufacturing 
Corp., a government property that will soon go private. It has 
included the 40 percent foreign ownership rule in its bid 
instructions. 
  Additionally, a recently published petroleum law regarding 
foreign investment in the local refining industry also orders 
that foreigners cannot hold more than a 30 percent stake in 
those businesses.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 7 (CNA) -- Bilateral relations between 
the Republic of China [ROC] and Indonesia may be on the verge of 
a major breakthrough with the forthcoming private visit by 
President Li Teng-hui to the Southeast Asian country. 
  According to foreign wire service reports, Li is scheduled 
to 
visit the tourist island of Bali this week. During his 
three-day stay, Li will meet with Indonesian President Suharto 
and Minister of Research and Technology B.J. Habibie. 
  Indonesia is one of the major targets in Taipei's "southern 
strategy" launched late last year to promote bilateral 
cooperation with Southeast Asia. Other countries targeted by 
the plan include Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. 
  During his visit to Indonesia, Li is expected to raise the 
question of Taiwan's planned US$10 billion investment on the 
island of Batam, 20 kilometers southeast of Singapore. 
  Taipei is attaching even greater importance to Indonesia 
these days because Indonesia is the current chairman country of 
the non- aligned movement and the host of the 1994 Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum meetings. 
  Taiwan, with 56 investments worth more than US$1.056 
billion, 
was the biggest investor country in Indonesia in 1991, according 
to Indonesian Government statistics. 
  In 1993, Taiwan investments dropped to 21 projects worth 
US$131 million. And by the beginning of this year, Taiwan's 
ranking slid to fourth place, behind Japan, Hong Kong and the 
Netherlands. 
  Local economic analysts attributed the decrease in Taiwan 
investments in Indonesia to increasing Taiwan investments in 
Mainland China and Vietnam. 
  Indonesia, however, is expected to become the best choice 
for 
Taiwan investors in 1994, rather than Vietnam, according to Liu 
Tai-ying, chairman of the Taiwan Institute for Research. 
  With its Five-Year National Economic Development Plan 
reaching maturity, Indonesia is expected to record 7 percent 
economic growth this year, Liu said. 
  Taiwan investors will succeed in Indonesia if they choose 
the 
right businesses with right partners, he added. 
  Economics Minister P.K. Chiang, who visited Indonesia twice 
recently, said Taiwan Sugar Corp.'s plan to set up a sugar 
refinery in Indonesia will be a good beginning for Taiwan's 
state-run enterprises to explore the rich raw materials resource 
and cheap labor force in that country. 
  Jeffrey Koo, chairman of the Chinatrust Commercial Bank 
which 
has established business links with Indonesia and other 
Southeast Asian countries, said Taiwan should emulate the 
Japanese formula by locating Taiwan banks in Indonesia where the 
banks can directly serve Taiwan investors. 
  Koo added that peripheral industries, including service 
industry, to help with investment are difficult to find in 
Indonesia. He suggested that potential investors should form 
their own investment army, including up-mid- and down-stream 
operations.

  [Text] Our region's total export and import volume 
amounted to $912 million in 1993, 36.42 times more than in the 
prereform years. An extensive pattern of opening up to the 
outside world in economic relations and trade has initially 
taken shape. 
  In 1993, our region continued to implement the strategic 
principles of opening up to the outside world in all directions, 
paying special attention to areas in the west, importing from 
abroad and cooperating with units in the interior, and 
establishing economic ties with regions in the east and 
distributing products to those in the west, thereby achieving 
fairly satisfactory results in foreign economic relations and 
trade. Total export and import volume amounted to $912 million, 
an increase of 30 percent over 1992. Of this, local border 
trade continued to grow rapidly; total local border trade volume 
reached $570 million in 1993, an increase of 80 percent over 
1992 or 68.3 percent of the region's total foreign trade volume. 
  Abulaidi Amudurexiti, deputy secretary of the autonomous 
regional party committee and acting chairman of the autonomous 
regional government, spoke at an autonomous regional work 
conference on foreign economic relations and trade that was held 
yesterday. He said: The year 1994 is one in which the 
autonomous region will develop its economy rapidly on the basis 
of high efficiency, and will advance reform of the foreign trade 
system. We should seize the current favorable situation in 
international markets, do a good job of earning foreign exchange 
from exports, and steadily develop local border trade while 
incessantly improving economic returns. We should improve the 
investment environment, and expand the scale of utilizing 
foreign capital and economic and technological cooperation. 
  Regional leaders Wang Lequan, Keyum Bawudun, Aisihaiti 
Kelimubai, and Li Donghui attended yesterday's conference.

  [Text] The autonomous regional work conference on reform 
of the economic system ended in Urumqi yesterday. Autonomous 
regional leaders Abulaidi Amudurexiti, Keyum Bawudun, and Wang 
Yousan attended the conference, which reviewed our region's 
progress in reforming its economic system last year, and studied 
and planned relevant tasks to be undertaken by our region this 
year. 
  In reforming its economic system this year, our region 
should 
focus on actively but steadily experimenting with the modern 
enterprise system as part of its continuing efforts to deepen 
enterprise reform. It should change enterprises' operating 
mechanisms, vigorously promote enterprise associations, and 
expedite readjustment of enterprises' organizational structure. 
In small state-owned enterprises, it should actively implement 
the systems of management by people under state ownership, 
management by the private sector under public ownership, and 
cooperation through share holdings. In optimizing and reforming 
the commodity circulation system, it should continue to develop 
commodity markets and expedite the process of unifying the 
prices of production means. In the realm of commodity 
circulation, it should shatter regional blockades, trade 
monopolies, and compartmentalization. It should earnestly 
change governmental functions and reform the government's 
leadership system regarding economic work, so as to facilitate 
efforts to exercise macroeconomic regulation and control, serve 
the grass roots, and raise work efficiency. It should continue 
to deepen rural reform, speed up the pace of establishing social 
service networks in rural areas, further accelerate the 
development of village and town enterprises and the invigoration 
of county-level industrial enterprises, and lead people of all 
nationalities across Xinjiang toward common prosperity. 
  Speaking at the conference, Abulaidi Amudurexiti, deputy 
secretary of the autonomous regional party committee and acting 
chairman of the autonomous regional government, said: It is 
hoped that party and government leaders at all levels will show 
a strong sense of urgency, responsibility, and crisis about 
speeding up reform. They should be determined to accelerate 
reform in light of Xinjiang's reality. In shifting to a market 
economy, they should pay close attention to properly handling 
the relationship between development, reform, and stability. 
They should follow the principle of first carrying out 
experiments in selected areas and then popularizing the results, 
gradually unfolding work on the basis of economic returns.

  [Text] Chengdu, February 8 (XINHUA) -- More key 
infrastructure projects have been completed or gone into 
operation in southwest China's Sichuan Province, greatly 
boosting the local economic prosperity. 
  The projects are mainly in the transportation, 
telecommunications, energy, water conservancy and raw material 
production sectors, according to officials of the provincial 
office for the construction of key projects. 
  The projects include an expressway between Chengdu and 
Chongqing, the second-phase construction of a digital 
telecommunications network, the Tongjiezi Hydropower Station, 
the second-phase construction of the Panzhihua Iron and Steel 
Company, the Longchang-Luzhou railway line, a chemical 
fertilizer plant, a chemical plant and a cement plant. 
  The Sichuan section of an optical fiber telecommunications 
cable line between Xian, capital of Shaanxi Province in 
northwest China, and Chengdu, capital of Sichuan, have been 
completed. 
  For a long time the backward infrastructure had hampered 
this 
inland province's economic development. 
  Last year Sichuan invested nearly nine billion yuan (over 
one 
billion U.S. dollars) in the construction of 60 construction 
projects -- both figures setting records for the province. 
  The responsibility system has been used for the construction 
of some projects, as a reform measure, to ensure quality and 
progress of construction, production, management and repayment 
of loans.

  [Text] At a meeting on summing up work for 1993 and 
commuting sentences which was held by the 1st autonomous 
regional reform-though-labor detachment on 31 January, prison 
terms for 90 prisoners were reduced as awards for having 
conscientiously followed prison rules and for truly repenting 
during their sentences. Of these, 19 were granted reductions in 
sentences or released on parole. They were discharged 
immediately following the meeting. 
  It is reported that during their sentences, some of these 
prisoners who were given such awards exemplarily obeyed various 
prison rules; some worked diligently to study production and 
labor skills and brought considerable economic wealth to the 
prison and the state; and some bravely fought against other 
criminals' harmful behaviors. The reduction of these prisoners' 
sentences is to fully display the aim of our state's law for 
integrating punishment with reform. Based on the same 
principle, another 119 prisoners who behaved well in the first 
reform-though-labor detachment were given material rewards.

Expedite the Establishment of Market Economy -- Region Holds 
Economic Restructuring Work Conference, Yang Chuantang Puts 
Forward Five-Point Requirement for Comprehensive Fulfillment of 
This Year's Reforms"] 
  [Text] We should seize opportunities, deepen reforms, and 
expedite the establishment of a socialist market economic 
structure. A regional work conference on reforms of the economic 
structure was held in Lhasa 20 January. Yang Chuantang, 
Standing Committee member of the regional party committee and 
executive vice chairman of the regional government, put forward 
a five-point requirement for comprehensive fulfillment of this 
year's reforms in Tibet. 
  Pudoje, vice chairman of the regional people's congress 
Standing Committee, and Jiang Cuo [3068 2238], executive vice 
chairman of the regional government, were present at the 
conference. 
  Reviewing reforms of the economic structure in Tibet over 
the 
past 15 years, Yang Chuantang said in his speech: Like other 
parts of the country, Tibet initiated reforms of the economic 
structure in farming and pastoral areas, whereby the region has 
promoted and expedited economic restructuring as a whole. In 
recent years, we have actively reformed the planning system, 
striving to expand the fundamental role of markets in resource 
allocation; in reforming enterprises, we have readjusted the 
structure, delegated authority to enterprises and allowed them 
to retain profits, changed profit delivery to tax payment, 
introduced the contract system, and changed the operating 
mechanisms of enterprises; we have made relatively rapid 
progress in reforming the financial and taxation system; and we 
have scored initial successes in reforming government 
institutions, focusing on the transformation of functions. In 
addition, we have conducted a host of fruitful explorations in 
banking system reform, circulation system reform, ownership 
structure reform, and social security system reform. A review 
of Tibet's basic experiences in the 15-year reform shows that 
seizing opportunities for reform means seizing opportunities for 
development; and without making and expediting reforms, it is 
impossible to achieve and expedite development. 
  Comrade Yang Chuantang put forward the following five-point 
requirement for comprehensive fulfillment of reforms in 1994: 
First of all, it is necessary to make reform the top priority 
of the region and promote sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development of the regional economy. Leading cadres at all 
levels should keep a cool head, recognizing and facing squarely 
our backwardness and areas where we lag behind, and 
strengthening the intensity and accelerating the pace of reform. 
In the face of this historic opportunity, we must strive to 
push the regional economy to a new height and constantly build 
up our overall strength so as to keep up with the pace of 
national development. Second, it is necessary to effectively 
strengthen leadership over reform. As we will face more arduous 
tasks and higher demands of reform, party committees and 
governments at all levels should devote more energies to 
expediting reforms and carrying out their historic 
responsibility. To this end, party committees and governments 
at all levels should familiarize themselves with the guiding 
principles, basic ideas, specific content, and operational 
procedures of all reform measures in Tibet; and should work out 
well-conceived plans and make meticulous efforts to carry them 
out in an innovative way in the light of the realities of each 
locality or department. It is necessary to pay close attention 
to overall coordination of various reform measures, and to guard 
against contradictory policy measures and selfish departmental 
interests to the neglect of the overall situation. It is 
necessary to conduct investigations and study for solving new 
problems and circumstances in good time. It is also necessary 
to improve the legal system and raise its level of 
standardization. Third, it is necessary to emancipate our 
minds, strive to make innovations, and quicken the pace of 
establishing a new system. Leading cadres at all levels should 
make a sober estimate of the situation, emancipate the mind, be 
bold in practice, do a good job in carrying out pilot projects, 
strictly adhere to the criteria of the forces of production, 
concentrate efforts on innovative reform, and mobilize the 
masses in blazing a trail of building new systems with special 
characteristics. Fourth, it is necessary to improve the 
economic restructuring departments and go all out to closely 
coordinate all departments concerned in jointly completing the 
tasks of reform. Party committees and governments at all 
levels, as well as all departments, should provide manpower, 
materials, and financial resources for improving the economic 
restructuring departments, rationalizing relations with the 
departments and actively supporting their operation. Fifth, it 
is necessary to step up study and enhance quality to keep up 
with the demands of the new situation. In conclusion, the vice 
chairman urged leading cadres at all levels to study and master 
the basic law governing market economic operations by stepping 
up study, persisting in thinking over issues, earnestly 
conducting investigations and study, and constantly improving 
quality. He said: Party committees, governments, and economic 
restructuring departments at all levels, as well as all relevant 
departments, should create the essential conditions and conduct 
practical, diversified forms of training for improving the 
quality of cadres in Tibet. 
  Xiao Huaiyuan, director of the regional economic research 
center, outlined six major tasks of economic restructuring in 
Tibet this year: First, continuing to implement the 
"Regulations for Changing the Operating Mechanisms of Industrial 
Enterprises Owned by the Whole People" and "Procedures for 
Implementing the Regulations for Changing the Operating 
Mechanisms of Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People 
in Tibet Autonomous Region," and reinforcing work related to 
changing the operating mechanisms of enterprises; second, 
continuing to stabilize and perfect the party's basic policies 
in farming and pastoral areas and deepening reforms in these 
areas; third, accelerating the establishment of markets, focused 
on the nurturing of capital goods markets; fourth, ensuring a 
good job in reforming the fiscal and taxation, investment, and 
foreign trade systems, and expediting the establishment of 
macroeconomic control and regulatory mechanisms compatible with 
a market economy; fifth, deepening reform of the social security 
system and setting up social security organizations; and sixth, 
actively and yet prudently promoting urban housing reform. He 
pointed out: This year, reforms will be carried out in Tibet at 
a deeper level, in broader areas, and with an intensity and 
difficulty never seen before. Economic restructuring 
departments at all levels should diligently study various reform 
programs launched in the region and pay close attention to 
carrying them out.

  [Excerpts] The Yunnan Provincial CPC Committee held a 
meeting in Kunming yesterday on the results of punishing 
economic crimes. Provincial party Secretary Pu Chaozhu spoke at 
the meeting. He pointed out that since the Second Plenary 
Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, the 
provincial party committee and government have unremittingly 
persisted in doing two types of work simultaneously and have 
conscientiously carried out the three anticorruption tasks set 
by the party Central Committee and the State Council. 
Procuratorial and judicial institutions at all levels have 
closely coordinated with each other in cracking major and 
important cases. [passage omitted] 
  The provincial government has held an executive meeting to 
encourage all functional departments to severely curb the 
arbitrary collection of charges and imposition of fines. The 
general situation in anticorruption work is good and its 
development is healthy. 
  Pu Chaozhu stressed: We should understand that the fight 
against corruption is a protracted and difficult task running 
through the entire process of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. We should not overestimate the achievements in 
the current fight against corruption or remain contented with 
the initial results in this fight. Instead, we should carry out 
this combat unswervingly. [passage omitted] 
  All levels of party committees, discipline inspection 
departments, supervisory departments, procuratorial departments, 
and courts should have a clear idea of their responsibilities, 
organize their personnel, and take measures to fulfill the three 
tasks. The current anticorruption work should focus on solving 
major and important cases and on curbing malpractices. The 
circular on strictly prohibiting the use of public money for 
extravagant eating and drinking must be put into effect. 
  He Zhanjun, chief procurator of the provincial people's 
procuratorate, briefed the meeting on the results since the 
beginning of last year in examining some corruption and bribery 
cases throughout the province. He said: Last year 
procuratorial institutions throughout the province put 1,348 
corruption and bribery cases on file for investigation; of 
these, 749 were major and important cases, 55.6 percent of the 
total cases put on file; and 1,285 cases had been examined. 
[passage omitted] 
  Qiu Chuangjiao, president of the provincial higher people's 
court, reported to the meeting on the relevant situation. He 
said: Since the beginning of last year, people's courts at all 
levels in the province have examined 1,078 economic crimes of 
all kinds, including corruption, bribery, speculation, 
smuggling, deception, and tax evasion cases. They have 
sentenced 1,080 economic criminals. 
  The meeting was presided over by provincial party Deputy 
Secretary Ling Huan. Provincial party and government leaders He 
Zhiqiang, Liang Jinquan, Yin Jun, Liu Shusheng, Zhao Shumin, and 
Lang Dazhong attended the meeting. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Beijing Political Situation" column: Article by </F>
Jen Huiwen (0117 1979 2429) in Beijing on 2 Febuary 1994: "Deng 
Xiaoping Calls for Further Emancipation of the Mind"] 
  [Text] Every year over the past few years Deng Xiaoping 
has spent the Spring Festival in Shanghai. Every year when he 
is in Shanghai, he has a talk with Shanghai municipal party and 
government leaders, and expresses his views on the development 
of Pudong and the further development of Shanghai; he even puts 
forward suggestions for the CPC Central Committee. All this 
serves to show his earnest concern for the city of Shanghai. 
Deng Xiaoping blamed himself during his trip to southern China 
in 1992: "Shanghai has all the conditions for faster 
development, for it enjoys superiorities in able personnel, 
technology, and management, and it has a greater capability for 
spreading its influence. Looking back at what I have done! I 
realize that one of my major mistakes is my failure to add 
Shanghai to the existing four special economic zones. If I had 
done so, the Chang Jiang delta, the entire Chang Jiang Valley, 
as well as the nationwide situation of reform, could have 
progressed in the same wave." Thus it can be seen that the 
reason Deng shows special concern for Shanghai is that to him, 
the overall situation of nationwide reform and opening up 
depends on the development of Shanghai. 
<H5>  There Is No Limit to the Emancipation of the Mind </H5>
  This year, driven by his high hopes for Shanghai, Deng 
Xiaoping set his foot in Shanghai earlier than previous years. 
Accompanied by his daughter, Mao Mao, and others, he arrived in 
Shanghai before New Year's Eve. After his arrival, he inspected 
the grand Yangpu Bridge and the busy Shanghai streets around New 
Year's Day, and expressed his views to the municipal party and 
government leaders on how to speed up the pace of development in 
Pudong and in Shanghai as a whole. 
  According to a source in Beijing, on 3 January, after 
hearing 
reports by Shanghai municipal party and government leaders on 
Shanghai's development in 1993, Deng Xiaoping said: "I have 
come to Shanghai every year in the past few years, and I feel 
very pleased to see the development and changes that have taken 
place in the city. Practice has proved that the line of 
regarding economic construction as a central task is correct, 
for it tallies with our national conditions and has won the 
popular support. Shanghai has very good industrial, as well as 
scientific and technological foundations, and enjoys superiority 
in able personnel, so Shanghai should make greater 
accomplishments in reform and opening up; should persistently 
push forward Shanghai's reform, opening up, and economic 
construction with high standards and from high starting points; 
and should render service to the reform and opening up of the 
entire country. To this end, leading cadres are required to 
further emancipate their minds. It is true that Shanghai has 
attained great achievements and that Shanghai's leaders are 
open-minded. However, because society is undergoing development 
and because great changes are taking place every minute, there 
is no limit to the emancipation of our minds. Some people are 
worried that they may make mistakes and go to extremes if they 
overdo emancipation. Their worries are totally groundless. 
Static and metaphysical concepts go against the basic outlook 
of Marxism. In the final analysis, what these people have is 
fear; they fear that the nature of China's socialist system will 
be changed and that China will take the road of capitalism. Of 
course, they have good intentions, yet some people inside our 
party cannot bear the sight of many new things, even today, and 
they have become critics and commentators. Now they are playing 
a negative role and have hindered cadres from giving full play 
to their initiative and creativity." 
  People from Beijing's political circles believe that by 
claiming that "there is no limit to the emancipation of the 
mind," Deng Xiaoping aimed to call on cadres in Shanghai and the 
entire country to have the courage to open up a new situation in 
reform and development, and to reach a new realm of thought in 
the emancipation of the mind. Without constant emancipation of 
the mind, our cause will not undergo constant development. On 
13 January, Shanghai's JIEFANG RIBAO carried a commentator's 
article entitled "Further Emancipating the Mind." The article's 
detailed expositions of Deng Xiaoping's thinking on the issue of 
emancipating the mind has drawn the attention of the entire 
country. 
<H5>  We Need To Employ New Ideas in the Course of Reform </H5>
  According to the source, Deng Xiaoping added: "To push 
Shanghai's economic construction to an all-time high, the key 
issue is to employ new ideas in reform and opening up. This 
task requires us to further emancipate our minds. To attain the 
goal of further emancipating our minds, we need to overcome our 
fear and have greater courage. We can achieve new ideas only 
when we are willing to give it a try. To further emancipate our 
minds, we should oppose arrogance and shatter complacency. Do 
not be complacent over occasional successes. In short, to 
attain fairly great development in our economy, we need to make 
a change in our concepts. Yet we should not change only some of 
our concepts and keep the others; neither should we change our 
concepts in name only. "We communists advocate socialism. 
What is socialism? To put it frankly, some of our comrades are 
not clear about the definition, even today, or we can say that 
they have not entirely extricated themselves from the set 
patterns of dogmatism. The essence of socialism is to free and 
develop productive forces, to eliminate exploitation and 
polarization, and to reach the final target of common 
prosperity. We should tell people this truth over and over 
again until they can gain a thorough understanding," added Deng 
Xiaoping. 
  Deng Xiaoping continued: "I made it clear two years ago 
that we can hardly make new accomplishments if we do not have 
the courage or the energy to open up new paths. There is 
nothing in this world concerning which we can be 100-percent 
sure of its success and correctness. We need to rely on 
practice." 
  People in Beijing's political circles believe that by 
calling 
for "new ideas in reform and opening up," Deng Xiaoping actually 
is making known his hope that cadres should give rein not only 
to their enthusiasm, but also their initiative. There is no 
mistaking the target of his remarks, for many cadres nowadays 
are excessively sedate and lack initiative. They are afraid of 
taking risks, of being "the first" to make mistakes in 
explorations, and of losing their vested interests in reform. 
If they are worried by so many things, how can they set up an 
operational mechanism for the market economy and for pushing 
economic development onto a new level? It has been learned 
that, in order to counter this situation, the CPC top leadership 
has decided to make a serious change to its customary way of 
thinking concerning the selection of leaders, by which stress 
generally was placed on cadres' enthusiasm, instead of their 
initiative. It is imperative to have the courage to promote 
young cadres who have great potential and who dare to open up 
new paths. By so doing, we can appoint people on their merits, 
and give them jobs suited to their abilities. 
<H5>  Corruption Has Become a Malignant Tumor </H5>
  The source noted that Deng Xiaoping also touched on the 
current campaign against corruption. Deng Xiaoping indicated: 
"If party members and party cadres are corrupt and abuse their 
authority for personal gain, what right do they have to 
represent the people, and how can the people support them? We 
should dismiss cadres of this kind from their posts, and 
resolutely send to the people's courts those who deserve it. We 
must not be vague in this matter. Shanghai has attained results 
in this field, and it is correct for Shanghai to focus its 
campaign to build clean administration on department-level 
cadres. Your former mayor, Zhu Rongji, also has made some 
contributions to this achievement, and you should keep up the 
good work in the future." 
  Deng Xiaoping is telling the truth. During his tenure as 
mayor of Shanghai, Zhu Rongji always paid close attention to the 
building of clean administration and set strict rules for 
government cadres. At a people's congress meeting marking the 
commencement of his term of office, Zhu Rongji made it clear 
that his goal was to build a "clean, highly efficient, and 
highly authoritative" municipal government. He often cited an 
ancient saying: "The public will obey only a government that is 
clean, not one that is strict. Clean administration is the 
mother of authority." Shortly after he took office, Zhu Rongji 
instructed the municipal supervisory bureau: Your primary task 
is to keep a close watch on Shanghai's 506 department-level 
cadres. He believed that clean practices can be spread among 
all cadres of the municipality only when the senior-ranking 
cadres of the municipal government succeed in maintaining their 
cleanliness in administration. Under his leadership, the 
municipal government drew up and put into strict implementation 
rules for cadres on the building of clean administration, and 
all violators have been handled sternly. Under the influence of 
Zhu Rongji, Shanghai indeed attained remarkable results in the 
building of clean administration. 
  However, the problem of corruption is becoming increasingly 
serious on a national scale, and corrupt practices have become 
common social phenomena, a malignant tumor, and the biggest 
social contamination in mainland China today. Hu Anga1ng [5170 
7254 6921] and Kang Xiaoguang [1660 2556 0342], two experts from 
the National Conditions Analysis Group under the Chinese Academy 
of Sciences, have submitted to the CPC top leadership a "Report 
on National Conditions" entitled "Fighting Against Corruption 
Through Innovations in the System," yet so far, people can see 
no sign of new policy decisions by the CPC top leadership on a 
radical cure of the problem. People now believe that it was not 
alarmist talk when Deng Xiaoping pointed out 10 years ago that 
"the trend of corruption has broken out with tremendous force. 
If our party fails to pay serious attention on the problem and 
to resolutely check the trend, our party and country will have 
to face the possibility of changing color."

  [Text] Beijing, February 7 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin met here today with more than 30 veteran foreign 
experts, including Israel Epstein and Yokogawa Tatsuko, who have 
been working in China for several decades. 
  The experts come from the United States, France, Britain, 
Canada, Germany, Austria, Japan, Thailand and Malaysia. 
  During the meeting, Jiang, who is also general secretary of 
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), 
expressed his delight at meeting these experts as the 
traditional Chinese New Year is approaching. 
  On behalf of the CPC Central Committee, the State Council 
and 
in his own name, Jiang extended thanks to them for their hard 
work in the past year, wishing them good health, smooth work and 
family happiness in the new year. 
  At the meeting, the experts put forward proposals and 
suggestions on China's economic construction, culture, education 
and press. Jiang expressed his thanks to them for their 
proposals and concerns for China's development. 
  The Chinese president briefed the experts on China's 
economic 
development and the major events of 1993. He said that China 
will continue to follow the road of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and that it will grasp opportunities, 
deepen the reforms and opening up, promote development and 
maintain stability, so as to make the national economy keep a 
sustained, high-speed and healthy development and thus realize 
the all-round progress of the whole of society. 
  After the meeting, Jiang hosted a banquet for the foreign 
experts.

  [Text] Beijing, 31 Jan (XINHUA) -- More than 800 
specialists and scholars who have made remarkable contributions 
to the natural and social sciences attended a tea party jointly 
hosted by seven ministries and commissions to usher in the 
Spring Festival at the Great Hall of the People this afternoon. 
  Hu Jintao, Ding Guangen, Wen Jiabao, Song Jian, Wang 
Zhaoguo, 
and responsible comrades from relevant departments attended the 
tea party. 
  On behalf of the party Central Committee and the State 
Council, Song Jian extended season's greetings and warm regards 
to the specialists and scholars attending the tea party, as well 
as to the vast numbers of intellectuals across the country. 
  In his speech, Song Jian said: Over the past year, our 
country enjoyed economic development, political stability, 
national unity, and social progress. The party and people are 
sincerely grateful for the diligent and creative work carried 
out by the vast numbers of intellectuals across the country. 
  Speaking of the work to be carried out in the new year, Song 
Jian said: Our tasks will be heavier and more formidable. 
There is a wide scope for the vast numbers of intellectuals to 
fully display their ability and talent in pursuing the great 
cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  Song Jian said: The status and role of our country's 
intellectuals has become more important with the development of 
the situation. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important proposition -- 
"respect intellectuals and talented people," "intellectuals are 
members of the working class," and "science and technology are 
primary productive forces" -- has fundamentally established the 
status of our country's intellectuals. A social climate of 
embracing science, and of respecting learning and talent, has 
taken shape. The vast numbers of intellectuals are contributing 
to building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Their hard 
work has gained increasingly widespread recognition and respect 
in society. We firmly believe that the vast numbers of 
intellectuals will make fresh contributions to our country's 
socialist modernization, thus demonstrating a strong sense of 
responsibility and urgency toward this era. 
  Song Jian said emphatically: Giving full rein to the role of 
talented people is the key to making our undertakings flourish. 
From now on, all competent departments should continue to 
implement the party's policy toward intellectuals, study new 
circumstances and solve new problems in the course of deepening 
institutional reform, and further create a good environment that 
is conducive to expanding the role of intellectuals. 
  Specialists and scholars who attended the tea party -- which 
was jointly hosted by the CPC Central Committee's Organization, 
Propaganda, and United Front Work Departments; the Ministry of 
Personnel, the State Science and Technology Commission, the 
Ministry of Culture, and the People's Liberation Army's General 
Political Department -- included some Beijing-based academicians 
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [CAS]; young and middle-aged 
specialists whose titles have been approved by the Ministry of 
Personnel and who have made outstanding contributions; 
specialists, scholars, and artists who receive special 
government allowances; prominent specialists selected from 
various departments; specialists admitted into the "Program for 
Cultivating Transcentury Personnel"; winners of awards for young 
scientists; and outstanding young and middle-aged scientists who 
receive special funds. Professionals from all fronts and 
specialists of several generations got together today to 
reminisce about the past and to talk about the future. The 
spacious banquet hall was filled with joy and laughter. 
  Zhou Bingkun, CAS academician and professor at Qinghua 
University; Li Xueqin, research fellow at the History Institute 
of the thinese Academy of Social Sciences; Wu Zuze, CAS 
academician and research fellow at the Military Medical Sciences 
Academy; Li Delun, art adviser and lead conductor of the Central 
Philharmonic Society; and Wang Xuan, CAS academician and 
professor at Beijing University, delivered impromptu speeches at 
the party. They thanked the party, the government, and all 
sectors of society for their concern for and attention to 
intellectuals. They also expressed their views and made 
suggestions on scientific and technological development, 
spiritual civilization, and other issues. 
  Cultural workers staged brilliant theatrical performances at 
the party.

<F P=106> [By reporter Li Taoxin (2621 3447 2450) of the Central </F>
People's Radio Station and XINHUA reporter Sun Yong (1327 0516)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 2 Feb (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, member of 
the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee 
and chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference [CPPCC] National Committee, visited cadres at the 
organs of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce 
[ACFIC] this morning. He held informal discussions with them 
and wished all ACFIC members a Happy Chinese New Year. 
  Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, 
attended the discussions. ACFIC Honorary Chairman Wang 
Guangying, Honorary Vice Chairman Sun Fuling, Chairman Jing 
Shuping, Vice Chairmen Zhu Wenju and Hu Deping, and Executive 
Chairman Sun Anping [1327 1344 1627] reported on the ACFIC's 
involvement in government affairs, its commercial activities and 
operations, its development of overseas contacts, and its 
operations in "uniting, helping, guiding, and educating" 
representatives of non-publicly owned businesses. They also 
spoke about problems which the ACFIC must resolve immediately. 
  During the discussions, Li Ruihuan fully endorsed the great 
deal of work the ACFIC accomplished last year. He pointed out: 
Ensuring the coexistence of all sectors of the economy, with 
the publicly- owned sector the mainstay, has been a major policy 
pursued by the party since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th 
CPC Central Committee as well as an important element of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. Over the past decade or so, this policy has 
played an active role in developing the economy, helping the 
market to flourish, improving living standards, and creating 
jobs. 
  He said: At present, under the guidance of the guidelines of 
the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee, the prospects for developing the 
privately owned sectors of the economy are very good. Of 
course, we are faced with new situations and problems. He hoped 
that ACFIC cadres would emancipate the mind, seek truth from 
facts, go deep into the realities of life, boldly explore, and 
integrate theory with the practical situation to study these new 
situations and problems and contribute to the development of 
privately-owned sectors of the economy. 
  After the discussions, Li Ruihuan, Wang Zhaoguo, and others 
inspected the offices of ACFIC organs to gain a better idea of 
their working and living situations. 
  ACFIC Vice Chairman Jiang Minkuan presided over the 
discussions. Vice Chairmen Zhang Xuwu, Huan Yushan [2719 3768 
3790], Liu Minxue, Chen Jinxin, Qi Jingfa [7871 2529 4099], Wang 
Zhiguo, and Liu Yimin [0491 0001 3046] as well as advisers 
including Li Ding, Huang Liangchen, and Ye Baoshan attended the 
discussions.

  [Excerpts] Li Tieying, member of the Political Bureau of 
the CPC Central Committee, state councilor, and chairman of the 
State Economic Structural Reform Commission, headed a State 
Council survey team to Wuhan. After the survey, Li Tieying made 
this conclusion: As an experimental city for the establishment 
of the socialist market economic structure, Wuhan has the 
necessary foundation, conditions, and initiative. He hoped that 
Wuhan would play the Hubei card, the card of the economic belt 
of the Chang Jiang's middle reaches, and the card of the entire 
nation, and bring into full play its role as a comprehensive 
reform experimental city. 
  The State Council survey team arrived in Wuhan on 1 February 
for a five-day inspection of the city. While in Wuhan, Li 
Tieying and the survey team members, accompanied by provincial 
and Wuhan City leaders, inspected the Tianhe airport, the Wuhan 
Stock Exchange Center, the Wushang Group, the Wuhan Steel and 
Iron Corporation, and the 7 February Memorial Hall. While in 
the Tianhe airport, Li Tieying told a comrade in charge that 
this new airport must have a new mechanism. He wrote an 
inscription, which reads: A high departure point, a new 
structure, safety first, management first, and service first. 
  When Li Tieying entered the hall of the Wuhan Stock Exchange 
Center, warm applause broke out. Li Tieying told a person in 
charge of the stock exchange center that this center must be 
managed properly according to international practice. He also 
held talks with some Wuhan entrepreneurs in the Wuhan Steel and 
Iron Corporation, during which he solicited their opinions on 
how to form a modern enterprise system. 
  As early as 1984, the party Central Committee and the State 
Council selected Wuhan for a comprehensive reform experimental 
city of the country. This effectively stimulated the city's 
reform, opening up, and economic development. In December last 
year, the State Economic Structural Reform Commission formally 
decided on Wuhan for a new round of comprehensive experimental 
city reform, approved Wuhan's experimental program on 
establishing a socialist market economic structure, and set 
detailed requirements for Wuhan's reform. [passage omitted] 
  Li Tieying and the survey team members were of the opinion 
that Wuhan's explorations of state enterprise reform, price 
system reform, and market structural reform had had a certain 
impact on the entire country. Wuhan comrades have really 
understood that without reform, there is no way out; only reform 
will bring about the sustained, speedy, and healthy development 
of the economy. 
  Li Tieying said: Wuhan's reform corresponds with Wuhan's 
actual conditions, has yielded significant results, created much 
experience, and enjoys a high reputation in the country. 
Wuhan's reform has important bearings on reform explorations in 
hinterland cities. 
  Li Tieying stressed: This year is a crucial year of reform. 
In line with the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee, the state has speeded up 
establishment of the socialist market economic structure. The 
purpose is to emancipate and develop productive forces and to 
bring about a fine economic cycle and healthy economic 
development. Wuhan's development has resulted from reform and 
opening up. In the new round of reform, there will be plenty of 
scope and prospects for Wuhan to display its talents. 
  Li Tieying pointed out: A structural transformation is a 
huge systems engineering project, which requires strengthened 
party and government leadership in its implementation. The 
party and government should be the designers of the new 
structure and the builders as well. The State Economic 
Structural Reform Commission fully supports Wuhan's reform. 
Hubei should be used as a stage for Wuhan comrades to act on. 
[passage omitted] 
  Provincial and Wuhan City leaders including Guan Guangfu, 
Jia 
Zhijie, Hui Liangyu, Qian Yunlu, Li Daqiang, Wang Zhongnong, 
Zhao Baojiang, Li Yuan, Wang Shouhai, and Li Meifang accompanied 
Li Tieying and the survey team during their tour of Wuhan. Li 
Tieying and the survey team also listened to reports by 
provincial and Wuhan City party and government leaders.

Contributions of Veteran Comrades Cannot Be Disregarded -- The 
Autonomous Regional Advisory Commission Holds The Sixth 
(Enlarged) Plenary Session"] 
  [Text] The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional Advisory 
Commission held its Sixth (Enlarged) Plenary Session in Urumqi 
21 January. 
  The main task of this enlarged plenary session was to 
deliberate on the work report of the autonomous regional 
advisory commission. 
  Advisory commissions are transitional organizations which 
aim 
to change de facto lifelong tenure of leading cadres to a system 
of retirement. In accordance with the provisions of the party 
constitution passed by the 12th CPC National Congress, the Third 
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional CPC Congress elected the 
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional Advisory Commission in 
February 1984. 
  Since its founding 10 years ago, the autonomous regional 
advisory commission has continued to actively support and assist 
the autonomous regional party committee's work in various ways 
under the guidance of the autonomous regional party committee 
and in line with the tasks prescribed in the party constitution 
and with Comrade Wang Enmao's demand that the advisory 
commission assist and support the autonomous regional party in 
five areas. The autonomous regional advisory commission has 
taken the lead in studying and implementing the party's basic 
line, has maintained high political zeal and remains politically 
sober-minded at all times. It has vigorously participated in 
major decision-making discussions; enthusiastically offered 
ideas to the autonomous regional party committee; 
conscientiously accomplished the missions entrusted to it by the 
autonomous regional party committee; supported the audacious 
work of comrades at the first front; actively taken part in 
community activities; gone deep into realities to conduct 
investigations and study; strived to make itself more 
revolutionary; and set a good example in carrying on the party's 
fine traditions. The autonomous regional advisory commission 
has achieved fruitful results in its work over the past 10 years 
and has made great contributions to the social stability and 
economic development of the autonomous region. 
  Chen Xifu [7115 6007 1133], vice chairman of the autonomous 
regional advisory commission, presided over yesterday's plenary 
session and delivered a work report. 
  At the plenary session yesterday afternoon, Song Hanliang, 
secretary of the autonomous regional party committee, spoke 
highly of the autonomous regional advisory commission's great 
contributions to the social stability and economic development 
of the autonomous region since its founding 10 years ago. He 
pointed out: Over the past 10 years, the autonomous regional 
advisory commission has closely centered itself around the 
party's basic line; vigorously supported and assisted the 
autonomous regional party committee; and done a tremendous job 
in maintaining the party's unity and social and political 
stability by safeguarding the national unity, upholding the 
unification of the motherland, and accelerating reform, opening 
up, and economic development. It has made new historical 
contributions to the party and people of various nationalities 
in Xinjiang. The party, the government, and people of all 
nationalities in Xinjiang will never forget the historical 
contributions made by veteran comrades. 
  On behalf of the autonomous regional party committee, the 
autonomous regional people's government, and people of all 
nationalities in the region, Song Hanliang conveyed their 
heartfelt thanks and great respect to the veteran comrades. He 
sincerely hoped veteran comrades would, as always, concern 
themselves with and support the work of the autonomous regional 
party committee; apply their wisdom and rich accumulated 
experience to reform, opening up, and modernization; continue to 
exert themselves; and make as many new contributions to the 
party and people as possible. 
  In view of the fact that the autonomous regional advisory 
commission has accomplished its historical mission, the current 
plenary session will, in its work report, propose the abolition 
of the autonomous regional advisory commission and submit the 
report to the Sixth (Enlarged) Plenary Session of the Fourth 
Autonomous Regional Party Committee, which will be held on 22 
January. 
  Autonomous regional party and government leaders Song 
Hanliang, Abulaiti Amudurexiti, Zhang Fusen, Jin Yunhui, Wang 
Lequan, and Keyum Bawudun attended the (enlarged) plenary 
session of the autonomous region advisory commission yesterday 
afternoon. They joined the old and new members participating in 
the meeting in having a group photograph taken to mark the 
occasion.

Fuping, Wang Yousan, Aisihaiti Kelimubai, Zhang Heng, Mijiti

<F P=106> [By Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Liu </F>
Zhenying (0491 2182 5391), and XINHUA reporter He Ping (0149 
1627)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 29 Jan (XINHUA) -- The national conference 
on propaganda and ideological work ended in Beijing today after 
a six-day session. The meeting pointed out that we must firmly 
adhere to the basic guideline -- namely, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics -- 
focus on economic construction, obey and serve the general 
requirements set for the whole party, and carry out all 
assignments for the propaganda and ideological front so as to 
provide powerful ideological support and a good environment 
needed to speed the establishment of a socialist market economic 
system; achieve sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic 
development; maintain political stability; and accelerate 
progress in all sectors of society. 
  Ding Guangen, member of the Political Bureau and Secretariat 
of the CPC Central Committee and head of its Propaganda 
Department, addressed today's session, which was chaired by Li 
Tieying, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau 
and state councillor. 
  In his speech, Ding Guangen pointed out: The conference on 
propaganda and ideological work held at this crucial period has 
a significant bearing on the overall situation. It is a meeting 
held at a time when the Central Committee, following the 
principle of being firm in attending to ideological and 
political work while proceeding with economic construction, is 
mobilizing the whole party and all propaganda and ideological 
workers to emancipate their minds, seek truth from facts, 
intensify and improve propaganda and ideological work, and do an 
even better job in expediting socialist material and spiritual 
construction. This meeting has helped us to understand the 
situation more clearly, heighten our awareness, achieve a 
consensus of views, understand our assignments, and increase our 
confidence. We believe that this meeting will have a positive 
and significant impact on improving our propaganda and 
ideological work, creating a new situation, and accomplishing 
the Central Committee's assignments more effectively. 
  Ding Guangen said: The basic guidelines, basic principles, 
concept of work, major tasks, and plans for propaganda and 
ideological work today and in the time to come are clear. The 
key requirement now is to make earnest efforts to comprehend and 
implement the guidelines in the important speeches given by 
leading comrades of the Central Committee, work earnestly, and 
firmly accomplish all assignments. 
  Ding Guangen said: At this conference General Secretary 
Jiang 
  Zemin has further expounded the main assignments for 
propaganda and ideological work. He pointed out that comrades 
on the propaganda and ideological front must firmly adhere to 
the basic guideline -- building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics -- and underscore work in four areas: theory, 
the media, ideological education, and the main theme [zhu xuan 
lu 0031 2467 1774], namely the work of "arming the people with 
scientific theories, guiding them with correct public opinion, 
moulding them with lofty spirit, and inspiring them with 
outstanding works." He said: The concept of "one basic 
guideline and work in four respects" which Comrade Jiang Zemin 
presented is the general plan and strategic thinking for 
intensifying propaganda and ideological work while building a 
new socialist market economic system. This concept embodies the 
past and present experiences China has gained from doing 
propaganda and ideological work during the period of socialist 
construction, it expounds the objective requirements which the 
law for socialist modernization has set for propaganda and 
ideological work, and it firmly grasps major propaganda and 
ideological issues having a close bearing on the overall 
situation. As far as the propaganda and ideological front is 
concerned, the basic guideline is the soul that sets the course 
of all our work, and the work in four areas is characterized by 
the four major construction projects embodying the basic 
guideline and projects that enable this guideline to succeed. 
When they uphold this basic guideline and accomplish the four 
major construction projects, departments in charge of propaganda 
and ideological work can accomplish their important missions 
more effectively; correctly publicize the party's theory, lines, 
principles, and polices; vividly reflect the people's great 
accomplishments; and unite all forces that can be united to 
fight and achieve the magnificient objective of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  Ding Guangen noted: To accomplish the assignments of the 
propaganda and ideological front and upgrade our work, we must 
continue to emancipate our minds, seek truth from facts, and 
follow the course of reform and opening up. The reform of 
propaganda and ideological work should be compatible with the 
requirements for developing the socialist market economy and 
socialist modernization, and it should be in line with socialist 
spiritual construction and the law of the development of 
propaganda and cultural undertakings themselves. Many things 
should be done in reforming propaganda and ideological work. In 
light of the current situation, it is urgent that we work hard 
in the following areas: First, we must uphold the principle 
that, in spiritual construction, we must place emphasis on 
construction instead of "launching movements" and carrying out 
"mass criticism" as in the past. Second, we must implement the 
principle of doing our work democratically and providing 
guidance. This means that we must respect people, understand 
them, and care about them so that we can arouse their 
initiative. Third, we must fully count on social forces and 
take advantage of the modern mass media. Fourth, we must 
intensify macroscopic control of propaganda and cultural 
undertakings, paying attention to guidance, total supply and 
demand [zong liang 4920 6852], mix of undertakings, and results, 
so that propaganda and cultural undertakings can be even more 
compatible with the needs of society. Fifth, we must make 
positive efforts to develop a socialist cultural market and make 
sure that it will develop healthily and thrive. Sixth, we must 
pay attention to research, and we must learn from foreign 
countries' outstanding cultures, achievements, and experiences 
in managing their cultural undertakings. Seventh, we must 
reform the management of our propaganda and cultural 
undertakings. Eighth, we must be more management conscious and 
speed the institutionalization and standardization of propaganda 
and cultural work so that there are regulations to follow. In 
short, the reform of propaganda and cultural undertakings must 
be conducted in a manner that enables the party to strengthen 
and improve its leadership over propaganda and culture, enables 
propaganda and cultural workers to bring their initiative and 
creativity into play, that furthers the prosperity of propaganda 
and cultural undertakings, and that furthers material and 
spiritual construction. 
  To implement effectively the guidelines laid down by the 
conference, Ding Guangen stressed: We should assist propaganda 
and ideological work and not create trouble for it, sing the 
main theme and not create "noise," pay attention to social 
results and not to gains at the expense of integrity, abide by 
propaganda discipline and not do things our own way, centralize, 
not decentralize, our efforts, and do solid, not superficial, 
work. 
  Ding Guangen pointed out: To carry out all assignments put 
forth by the party Central Committee, the propaganda and 
ideological front must have a contingent of good cadres. To be 
qualified propaganda and ideological cadres, we must have strong 
enterprising spirit and a high sense of responsibility. We must 
keep firmly in mind the need to consider Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the 
basic guideline, uphold the party's basic line without wavering, 
and maintain unity with the party Central Committee politically 
and ideologically as well as in action. We must consider the 
interests of the masses and serve the people wholeheartedly. We 
must be politically sharp, sober-minded, and take clear-cut 
stands. We must uphold dialectical materialism and guard 
against one-sidedness. We must be involved in discussing and 
handling important matters and keep the overall situation in 
mind. We must be broad-minded and able to promote unity. We 
must conduct in-depth investigation and be good at summing up 
experiences. When we work, we must make sure that actual 
results will be achieved. We must be strict with ourselves and 
perform our duties honestly. We must study hard and think 
diligently. 
  Ding Guangen stressed: Comrades working on the propaganda 
and ideological front must rally closely around the party 
Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, persist 
in regarding Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics as the basic guideline, 
uphold the party's basic line for 100 years without wavering, 
strive to achieve unity and stability, exert great efforts, and 
do our work pragmatically. We must have a clear idea of 
general requirements, seize opportunity, boost morale, and 
proceed with an exploratory spirit. We must emancipate our 
minds, seek truth from facts, be down to earth, and work hard so 
that our propaganda and ideological work can reach a new level 
and can can create a new situation and make fresh contributions. 
  When the conference was in session, those in attendence 
studied the important speeches of Comrades Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, 
and Zhu Rongji, studied Deng Xiaoping's expositions on socialist 
spiritual construction, and discussed propaganda and ideological 
projects for 1994. 
  Li Lanqing, Wei Jianxing, and other leading comrades 
attended 
today's session.

"Establish a New Concept for the New Year"] 
  [Text] With the improvement of people's material life, the 
significance of the New Year and the way people celebrate it 
also have changed. The overall trend of development is good, 
but there is no denying that some people have gone to bizarre 
lengths to celebrate their New Year, holding extravagant 
functions to cultivate social relations with a view to 
furthering their interests, or even pursuing illegal activities. 
  In line with social progress, we must establish a new 
concept 
for the New Year. 
  We must establish a new "thrifty New Year" concept. 
Recently, reform and opening up have raised people's living 
standards considerably and have increased their consumption 
power. A certain number of regions and people seem to have 
forgotten how all this came about and have become extravagant, 
holding banquets to celebrate the New Year and festivals, trying 
to outspend each other. This "nouveau riche" demeanor is 
absolutely wrong. We must see the rapid development of our 
economy, as well as the fact that there still are people who 
have not solved the problem of getting enough to eat and clothe 
themselves with, and that millions of students are unable to pay 
their tuition fees. Horizontally speaking, we still lag behind 
many countries. Vertically speaking, our foundation is not yet 
solid. Granted, we will be very rich in the future, but we 
still should uphold the good traditional morals of hardwork and 
thriftiness and the good style of arduous struggle. 
Individually, most of us earn our income through toil. 
Throwing away the money earned through daily labor on a 
spending spree is unfortunate, unnecessary, and not worth it. 
  We must establish a new "stay-clean" New Year concept. 
During the Spring Festival, it is only normal for units to 
visit each other to boost relations, and for individuals to 
visit relatives to renew and strengthen friendship. A few units 
and individuals, however, may give gifts under the cover of the 
festive season and at the expense of the state or may bribe 
people under the cover of social calls, to the extent of 
breaking the law. This is abnormal and must be halted firmly. 
Encouraging clean government is part of the agenda of socialist 
spiritual civilization and must be pursued through unyielding 
efforts. During the Spring Festival, the broad mass of the 
people must be highly self-disciplined; party and government 
cadres of all ranks should practise what they enforce, set a 
good personal example, refuse to give or accept bribes or to 
take advantage of anyone, and set an example of "clean 
government" for the people. 
  We must establish a new "civilized" New Year concept. Over 
the years, socialist spiritual civilization has improved 
people's spiritual lives greatly, but we must see that certain 
unhealthy practices always surface at the Spring Festival. 
People play mahjong, gamble, worship ancestors, disseminate 
superstitious beliefs, and socialize to extend kinship networks 
-- all unhealthy, uncivilized activities in that are out of tune 
with the happy festive atmosphere. Another meaning of 
celebrating a "civilized" New Year is to voluntarily observe law 
and discipline, lead an orderly life, and be a civilized 
passenger, audience, and worker, and in short, a civilized 
citizen. 
  We must establish a new "planned New Year" concept. In 
traditional Chinese customs, the Spring Festival is the 
beginning of a new year. It does not harm us to sit down and 
review the past and take a look at the future; to see what we 
achieved and did not achieve last year, and sum them up; and to 
outline the work and objectives for next year. Thus, we really 
can "make a step of progress with the passing of another year." 
  Spring is the time to plan for the whole year. In the 
history of our civilization, the Spring Festival is the most 
important of all festivals. It takes place in spring -- at the 
start of a year. Therefore, it is highly significant for us -- a 
populous, not so wealthy developing country -- to celebrate the 
New Year properly. To do that, we must establish a New Year 
concept that corresponds with the times. That is only the first 
step. The most important is practice. 
  The 1994 step is approaching. Here I wish everybody a happy, 
harmonious, comfortable, and healthy New Year!

  [Text] Beijing, February 5 (XINHUA) -- China's State 
Council recently promulgated two groups of regulations on 
religious services in China. 
  Signed by Premier Li Peng, the two series of regulations -- 
on "The Management of Foreign People's Religious Activities in 
China" and on the "Management of the Places of Religious 
Activities" -- took effect on January 31. 
  The first group noted that China respects foreign people's 
freedom of religious belief in the country and it protects 
foreign religious people's friendly exchanges and cultural and 
academic exchanges in religion with Chinese counterparts. 
  It noted that foreign people can go to China's religious 
places, including temples, mosques and churches, to participate 
in religious activities. 
  They can preach at religious places in China at the 
invitation of the religious organizations at and above 
provincial level and they can hold religious activities 
participated by foreigners at places which are recognized by the 
religious administrative departments of the government at and 
above county level. 
  Foreign people in China can invite Chinese religious people 
to hold religious ceremonies for them, including baptism, 
wedding, funeral ceremony and Taoist and Buddhist rites. 
  The regulations noted that foreign people who enter China 
can 
bring with them religious printed matters, religious recordings 
and video tapes and other religious matters for their own uses. 
Materials which are more than for their own uses should be 
handled by Chinese customs offices according to relevant 
regulations. Entry of religious materials which have contents 
harmful to China's social public interests is banned. 
  The 13-article regulations stressed that foreign people 
should abide by China's laws and regulations in their religious 
activities in China. They cannot set up religious 
organizations, set up religious offices or run religious places 
and schools in China. Foreign religious people must not 
cultivate religious disciples among Chinese citizens and appoint 
religious clergy. 
  The second group of regulations, with 20 articles, is 
intended to improve management of religious places in China. 
  The regulations said that setting up of religious places 
should be subject to registration. Religious places should be 
managed by their own managing organizations. The legitimate 
rights and interests and normal religious activities of the 
places are protected by law and no organizations and individuals 
should infringe upon and interfere in the legitimate rights and 
the normal activities. 
  Laws and regulations should be observed when religious 
activities are held in religious places. No people are allowed 
to make use of religious places to conduct activities which 
undermine the national unity, unity of nationalities and social 
stability, impair citizens' health and hinder the state 
education system. Religious places should not be controlled by 
overseas organizations and individuals. 
  The managing organizations of religious places can receive 
donations from the public. Donations from overseas religious 
services and individuals to religious places in China should be 
disposed of according to relevant regulations of the country. 
  In religious places, the managing organizations can sell 
religious art ware, books and magazines according to the 
stipulations of the country. 
  The managing organizations of religious places should have 
licences for their land, mountains and houses, which are issued 
by the country. 
  The managing organizations of religious places should abide 
by the laws and regulations on protection of cultural relics and 
environment protection. 
  The new regulations also listed some penalties for 
infringements of China's laws and regulations.

Kuoshan (5685 2368 0810) and XINHUA reporter Zhou Zhifang (0719 
1807 2455)] 
  [Text] Xichang, 2 Feb (XINHUA) -- On the eve of Chinese 
Spring Festival, good news comes from the depth of the Dalian 
Mountains -- a large-scale technological renovation project for 
introducing high and new technologies to the Xichang Satellite 
Launching Center has been accomplished. Many overall testings 
conducted by scientific and technological personnel show that 
the renovated launching facilities can launch various kinds of 
carrier rockets and that China has enhanced its capability in 
conducting overall testings for satellite launches. 
  Established in the early seventies, the Xichang Satellite 
Launching Center has conducted 12 satellite and rocket launches, 
thus making important contributions to China's aerospace 
undertakings. To meet the need of launching new types of 
telecommunications satellites by China's new types of carrier 
rockets, the Xichang Satellite Launching Center -- with great 
support from dozens of scientific research and manufacturing 
units across the country -- conducted a large-scale 
technological renovation in 1993 by using modern technologies to 
upgrade launching command, control, and telecommunications 
systems, enabling real-time command of carrier rocket and 
satellite launching to become even more modernized. By adopting 
internationally advanced computer technology, the ability of the 
center's computers in collecting and handling data has been 
greatly increased and their stability and reliability have been 
remarkably improved. The commanding display system becomes more 
quick, visible, and accurate, thanks to the use of advanced 
audio-visual image formation and transmission technologies. 
Scientific and technological personnel took one year to 
accomplish more than 100 important renovation projects including 
the launching tower system, the propellant injection system, and 
the testing environment for rockets and satellites. The 
renovated tower system is equipped with multiple functions, and 
its supplementary facilities have been improved. The 
low-temperature propellant utilization system shows that China 
has made new progress in the technological fields of increasing 
the propulsive force of carrier rockets and saving energy. The 
improvement of the quality of artificial environment for testing 
satellites and rockets can meet domestic and international 
requirements for launching various kinds of satellites and 
enhance the ability of China's aerospace industry to compete in 
the international market.

  [Text] The Xichang satellite launch center has smoothly 
completed its large-scale technical transformation. A 
comprehensive appraisal by scientific and technological 
personnel indicates that following this technical 
transformation, the launch facilities can launch many types of 
carrier rockets. China's comprehensive satellite launching 
ability has improved. 
  In 1993, the Xichang satellite launch center carried out a 
large-scale technical transformation, with the support of dozens 
of scientific research and production units throughout the 
country. Technological personnel completed the transformation of 
more than 100 important projects -- including the launch pad 
system, the booster acceleration system, and the testing system 
for rockets and satellites -- thus improving the ability of 
China's space flight industry to join international competition.

  [Text] Beijing, February 8 (XINHUA) -- A powerful carrier 
rocket newly developed by China successfully launched a 
scientific satellite and a simulated satellite into space at 
southwestern China's Xichang launch site this afternoon. 
  The two satellites have now been injected into synchronous 
orbits, according to reports from Xian Satellite Control Center 
and the space measurement vessel "Yuanwang" which was observing 
the satellites at the Pacific. 
  The two satellites were launched by a "Long-March 3A" 
carrier 
rocket, which was developed recently by the Space Industry 
Corporation for launching China's new-type communications 
satellites. 
  The "Long-March 3A" rocket, which was patterned after 
"Long-March 3," is capable of launching a 2.5-ton satellite. 
  The "Long-March 3" rocket, which is capable of launching a 
1.4-ton satellite, ranks fourth in the world in terms of 
launching capabilities. 
  The scientific satellite "SJ-4", carrying six sound 
instruments, will probe charged particles and their effects in 
near-earth space. 
  With the satellite, which was developed by the space center 
under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese space scientists 
can calculate the parameter of the particles' distribution and 
the necessary electric potential for charging satellite 
batteries.

<F P=106> [By Cheng Te-lin (6774 1795 2651): "CPC is Going to Improve </F>
Equipment of Its Navy and Air Force"] 
  [Text] According to well-informed sources, on 5 January, 
accompanied by Navy Commander Zhang Lianzhong; Defense Minister 
Chi Haotian; Wu Bangguo, secretary of the party committee of the 
Nanjing Military Region; the veteran general Li Desheng; and Li 
Jiejun, director of the General Office of the Central Military 
Commission, a certain CPC elder paid a call at the Command Base 
of the Donghai Fleet at the mouth of the Wusong River, Shanghai 
to inspect a nuclear-powered missile submarine which was 
officially put into service that day. According to informed 
sources, it is China's 11th nuclear-powered missile submarine 
with 8,000 tonnes displacement and is an improved model 
Xia-class nuclear-powered missile-launching submarine. The 
submarine was originally scheduled to be launched on 1 January, 
but in order for the CPC elder to inspect it, it was not 
officially put into service for the Donghai Fleet until 5 
January. 
<H5>  China is Capable of Returning a Nuclear Attack </H5>
  The informed sources added: After meeting with 
representatives of the navy's nuclear submarine, missile 
destroyers, and airborne troops, the elder gave a speech: "I am 
very glad today. As a citizen, an old party member, and a 
veteran, I express gratitude to our People's Army and to our 
defense and scientific and technological experts! During the 
hard times in the 1960's, we exploded the atomic bomb, breaking 
through the nuclear monopoly and nuclear threat of the major 
powers. In the turbulent years of the 1970's, we upgraded 
nuclear weapons. This demonstrated that China was capable of 
developing and improving nuclear weapons and defending itself. 
In the years of reform and opening up which centered on 
economic development during the 1980's, we developed 
intercontinental missiles, nuclear-powered submarines, and 
others things, by which we declared to the world that China is 
capable of returning a fatal blow to any aggressor that launches 
a nuclear attack. In the years between 1990's and the year 
2000, depending mainly on our own capability, we must change the 
equipment of the navy and the air force quite considerably. 
This is the policy of the central authorities. 
<H5>  Hegemony Fears China's Development </H5>
  This elder continued: Hegemony and power politics and their 
followers themselves do not want to reduce their armaments or 
totally ban and destroy their nuclear weapons, and yet they are 
against and fear China's developing a modernized military 
capability. Isn't this overbearing! Now that they see that 
China is developing a little quicker and that its national 
strength is a little bigger, they criticize, fan feelings, and 
create the theory that China is going to threaten its neighbors. 
This has always been a means used by power politics and 
anti-Chinese and anti-communist political forces. The Chinese 
Government solemnly declares that it will not be militarily 
aligned and will not interfere and intervene in the internal 
affairs of another country and that it insists on resolving 
differences, disputes, and problems left over from history 
between nations by peaceful and fair ways of negotiation which 
is to seek common ground while reserving differences. China 
will never pursue hegemony in the international arena nor will 
it pursue special privileges in a region as a "small 
hegemonist." China maintains that all countries are equal 
despite their size and strength. Therefore, China did not, does 
not, and will never accept interference in China's sovereignty 
and internal affairs of hegemony and power politics or their 
ordering about; nor will it be daunted by their political 
challenges such as economic sanctions, unilaterally dishonoring 
communiques or joint declarations between nations, or rejecting 
agreements between the governments of nations. Rather, what they 
are doing will help the entire army and people across the 
country to be united more closely, to take their own way more 
determinedly, and to have a more better understanding that only 
when the country is unified and strong and has the initiative in 
its hands can it really enjoy equality, freedom, and democracy. 
  The elder's speech, which lasted nearly 20 minutes, won 
eight 
rounds of warm and long applause.

  [Text] Shenzhen, February 7 (XINHUA) -- The Daya Bay 
Nuclear Power Plant in Guangdong Province is safe and reliable 
and poses no threat to nearby regions, according to Chinese and 
foreign experts. 
  Situated more than 40 kilometers from Shenzhen and over 50 
kilometers from Hong Kong, the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant has 
two generating units each with a capacity of 900,000 kilowatts. 
  After seven years' construction, the No. 1 reactor unit went 
into commercial operation on February 1 and the No. 2 unit 
started trial operation today after it completed its "critical 
state" test in January. It is expected to go into commercial 
operation in the first half of this year. 
  The Chinese and foreign experts who are working at the plant 
said that the type of reactors, their installation and try-outs, 
and waste materials to be discharged are safe and reliable. 
  They noted that it poses no threats to nearby regions. 
  The reactors at the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant are of the 
pressurized water type, which has a high safety coefficiency. 
  During their installation, Chinese and foreign engineers and 
workers adopted a series of quality control measures to ensure 
safe operation. 
  Zan Yunlong, general manager of the Guangdong Nuclear Power 
Joint Venture Co. Ltd., said that in constructing the nuclear 
power plant, his company has strictly followed the principle of 
"quality first and safety first". 
  Zan, who has worked in the nuclear power industry for many 
years, said that the project was completed in line with the laws 
and regulations on nuclear safety issued in China and it passed 
several examinations and appraisal by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency. 
  R. Vella, operations manager from France, said that the 
operational system of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant is like 
that of the nuclear power plants in France. 
  He said that the operators of the plant received training in 
France and they have made remarkable progress with the help of 
20 French technological advisers. 
  He said that he was confident of the ability of the Chinese 
technological personnel to operate the Daya Bay Nuclear Power 
Plant. 
  He noted that it is totally groundless to say that the 
nuclear power plant threatens the safety of Hong Kong and nearby 
regions. 
  Experts said that the waste gas of the plant will be 
processed before it is discharged into the air. 
  The radiation index of the processed gas is at a much lower 
level than that by radiation of the universe. 
  The waste liquids will be recycled for re-use. The waste 
materials will be sealed up in uniquely designed containers for 
ten years before they are buried deep underground and they will 
cause no safety problems.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "A Rich Fruit of Reform and Opening </F>
Up -- Congratulating the Start of Commercial Operations by the 
No. 1 Generating Unit of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station"] 
  [Text] The Spring Festival is just around the corner, and 
inspiring good news has come from the Daya Bay nuclear station 
in the south of the motherland: The No. 1 generating unit has 
officially been put into commercial operation, the commissioning 
of the No. 2 generating unit is progressing smoothly, and the 
entire project will be completed and put into operation this 
year. This is an important achievement in the peaceful use of 
nuclear energy and nuclear technology in our country, and is a 
rich fruit of our reform and opening up. It will have an 
important and far-reaching impact, not only on promoting the 
economic prosperity of Guangdong and Hong Kong, but also on the 
further development of nuclear undertakings in our country. 
  The Daya Bay nuclear power station is the product of reform 
and opening up. With the direct concern of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping and the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin 
as its core, the construction of the Daya Bay nuclear power 
station has adhered to the policy of reform and opening up, has 
opened up a new path for making use of foreign funds to build 
large basic industrial projects, and also has made useful 
attempts at the establishment of a modern enterprise system. At 
each crucial moment, leading comrades of the CPC Central 
Committee and the State Council have given it concern and 
support, and have solved a series of important problems so that 
the entire project could progress smoothly. Local governments 
and departments concerned have done a great deal of work and 
have supported all aspects of the construction of the nuclear 
power plant. The successful construction of the Daya Bay 
nuclear power station is the result of giving play to the 
enthusiasm of the central authorities and of the local 
governments, as well as the result of the concerted efforts of 
all quarters concerned across the country. 
  In the entire course of the construction of the Daya Bay 
nuclear power station, the principles of "quality first and 
safety first" have been adhered to. Over one thousand nuclear 
power specialists and engineering technical personnel from more 
than 20 countries and regions have cooperated closely. The 
plant has absorbed the experience of, and has drawn lessons from 
nuclear power construction projects abroad. It has followed 
international safety standards and codes, and has established 
strict quality supervision and guarantee systems. It also has 
undergone safety assessments and examinations by state and 
international atomic energy organizations and specialists. 
Therefore, the project quality and operational safety of the 
nuclear power station is ensured. 
  Nuclear power is a safe, clean, and economical energy 
source. 
China's energy resources are abundant, but they are not evenly 
distributed. In particular, the comparative shortage of energy 
resources in the economically developed southeast coastal areas 
has constituted a "bottleneck" that is constraining economic 
development. Therefore, while making great efforts to develop 
thermal and hydropower, the appropriate development of nuclear 
power in accordance with local conditions is an important way to 
solve the energy-shortage problem in these areas. At present, 
China has made a good start in developing nuclear power. The 
300,000 kW Qinshan nuclear power station has been operating 
safely and steadily for more than one year and has reached the 
design load factor index two years ahead of schedule. After the 
Nos. 1 and 2 generating units of the Daya Bay nuclear power 
station are all completed and put into operation, together with 
the pumped-storage hydroelectric power stations, about 12.6 
billion kwh -- equal to the consumption of about 6 million 
tonnes of coal -- can be generated each year. This will ease 
much of the pressure on long-distance transportation and reduce 
environmental pollution, and the economic results and benefits 
to the society will be rather considerable. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping once explicitly pointed out: "We still 
have to develop nuclear power stations." Through the practice 
of constructing the Daya Bay and Qinshan nuclear power stations, 
we have accumulated experience, trained personnel, and created 
favorable conditions for the development of nuclear power. The 
broad masses of cadres and workers on the nuclear power front 
should seriously sum up experience, make persistent efforts, 
further implement the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress 
and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, 
seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider to the 
outside world, and make greater contributions to further the 
development of nuclear undertakings in China [zhua zhu ji yu,

  [Text] Beijing, February 8 (XINHUA) -- China's State 
Council has decided to cancel five tax items and leave two 
others to the discretion of local governments. 
  The move is aimed at simplifying and standardizing the 
taxation system. 
  The five cancelled taxes are those previously levied on 
trade 
fairs, livestock trading, bonuses and salary adjustments, and 
oil burning. 
  Meanwhile, the power to levy two other taxes -- on animal 
slaughter and banquets -- will be turned over to provincial, 
autonomous regional and municipal governments.

"The Market Economy Needs a Labor Market"] 
  [Text] The goal of the current reform is to build the 
socialist market economic structure. To build a market economic 
structure, a labor market is indispensable. It is a great 
breakthrough that the decision of the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th Central Committee set out the issue of a labor market. 
However, it does not mean that all issues concerning the labor 
market are solved. I should like to air my views on several 
issues that I have come across. 
<H3>  A Complete, Perfect Market Structure Is the Condition for 
the Building and Normal Operation of the Market Economy </H3>
  It has been 15 years since we conducted reform in the 
economic structure. In 1984 we set out the need to develop the 
commodity economy on the basis of public ownership. In 1992 we 
set out the building of the socialist market economy as the goal 
of China's reform of the economic structure. Both the planned 
commodity economy and the socialist market economy calls for a 
complete and perfect market system. Without a complete, perfect 
market structure, the development of the commodity economy or 
the market economy would be out of the question. 
  Today, China's market system remains incomplete and 
imperfect. The product market is comparatively mature, and the 
goods and equipment market is gradually opening up. However, 
the money and labor market have not yet taken shape. Over the 
past two years or so the money market has begun to bud, with 
exchange and securities companies founded. However, because of 
the lack of legislation and macroeconomic regulation and 
control, confusion surfaced in banking. The grave stagnation of 
the labor market has already become a bottleneck and a hurdle to 
completing and perfecting the market system and promoting the 
building of the socialist market economic structure. 
<H5>  Deepening Reform Calls For a Labor Market </H5>
  Presently, the hot spot in deepening reform is to implement 
the modern enterprise system, convert the operational mechanism 
of state-owned enterprises, streamline government organizations, 
and to readjust the industrial setup. All these are directly 
related to the labor market. 
  1. The modern enterprise system is the direction of reform 
of state-owned enterprises. Under the modern enterprise system, 
the enterprise property right relations are transparent, and 
with all its properties as a legal person, the enterprise 
operates on its own, and assumes sole responsibility for its 
profits and losses. This precisely calls for enterprises to 
organize production and operation based on market demand, and 
improve labor productivity and economic returns. That being the 
case, the enterprise must use personnel according to the needs 
of its own production and operation, and surplus personnel must 
be dispensed with. Enterprises suffering deficits over a long 
period must go bankrupt according to the law, and employment 
arrangements must be made for the workers of bankrupt 
enterprises. Under such circumstances, the labor market will 
play the role of a "reservoir," which will supply manpower 
resources when enterprises have such a demand, and when there 
are surplus hands in the enterprise, they can be put on the 
labor market to seek new jobs. 
  When an enterprise converts its operational mechanism, it 
will experience autonomy in 14 aspects, of which autonomy in 
personnel and labor employment are closely connected with the 
labor market. When an enterprise has autonomy in matters 
concerning labor and personnel, it will hire help and employ 
cadres on its own, and dismiss workers or cadres when it is 
overstaffed. Without a labor market, where would the enterprise 
hire the help it needs? If it continues to ask labor 
departments for workers, would it not be returning to the way of 
administrative allocation? Without a labor market, where would 
the enterprise's surplus workers go when they are let go? 
Should overstaffed personnel stay on at their posts, when the 
enterprise should continue to carry the burden of some 20-30 
percent of overstaffed personnel, how could it improve its labor 
productivity and economic returns? 
  2. Streamlining government organizations is an important 
step in the reform of the political structure. The NPC 
[National People's Congress] has already made a decision that 
personnel should be reduced in implementing the civil service 
system, whereas institutions must also reduce their personnel 
while improving efficiency. It will be impossible to rely on 
internal absorption of all workers thus let go, so it is 
imperative to reorganize employment through the labor market. 
Without a labor market, the government reform in streamlining 
organizations would also be difficult. 
  3. The adjustment of industrial setup is closely connected 
with the labor market. Some state-owned enterprises continue 
their production even when their products are unmarketable and 
overstocked. Whereas some products the market demands are in 
short supply; for example, the raw materials industry. To 
readjust this irrational arrangement, the greatest difficulty 
lies in the arrangements for workers. The approach is to allow 
the flow of workers from production departments that need be 
readjusted to those departments that need to be developed 
through the labor market. Without a labor market, the flow of 
labor force and readjustment in the employment structure would 
be out of the question, and it would be impossible to reallocate 
the fixed assets and circulation funds employed for this segment 
of workers. To readjust the employment structure and promote 
readjustment of the industrial setup, it is necessary to develop 
a unified national labor market with control. 
  The aforesaid shows that the labor market is the need of 
socialist economic development as well as in-depth reform, and 
is independent of people's subjective will. 
<H3>  The Inevitability of Labor Turning Into a Commodity Under 
the Socialist Condition </H3>
  The theory of labor being commodity is a prerequisite set 
out 
by the labor market. The labor market is the sum of the trading 
relations of labor. If labor is not commodity, where does the 
labor market come in? This truth is very simple and clear. 
  However, some of our comrades do not think so. They are 
afraid that, should they acknowledge that labor is commodity, 
they would negate workers' status as masters under socialist 
conditions, thus obliterating the difference between capitalism 
and socialism. Those comrades fail to see that there is 
objective inevitability for labor to become commodity under the 
socialist condition. 
  One of the characteristics of the socialist market economy 
is 
that all essentials must be allocated by the market, and will 
enter the production process only through market exchange. 
There is no exception to labor; otherwise, the normal operation 
of the socialist market economy would be out of the question. 
That is one side of the issue. From the worker's angle, 
proceeding from the individual's interest to obtain greater 
income, he would sell his labor on the market, thus labor is 
converted into a commodity. 
  Then, would it be as traditional theory put it that the 
worker had to sell his labor because he was divorced from 
production materials, and "had absolutely nothing to his name"? 
But historical facts are nothing like that. It was not because 
the worker had lost his production materials that determined the 
sale of his labor. In a slave society, the laborer and 
production materials were separated; nevertheless, the slave did 
not enjoy personal freedom, and independence in personality. 
His very body and labor belonged to the slave owner, and it was 
entirely impossible for him to sell his labor as a commodity, 
but he could be sold along with his labor by his owner. Under 
the feudal system, the laborer (serf or peasant) might own a 
small plot of land, but he could not get rid of his personal 
attachment to the feudal landlord, nor could they enjoy complete 
personal freedom, and independence in personality. It was also 
impossible for the worker to sell his own labor as a commodity. 
That being the case, in feudal society the inevitability of the 
conversion of labor to commodity did not exist. 
  The capitalist system is a developed market economy, and its 
operation is possible only when there is a complete and perfect 
market system, and calls for a mature labor market, with labor 
being a commodity. That is on the one hand. On the other hand, 
the reason the worker is now able to sell his own labor, and 
labor can be turned into a commodity, is that the worker has now 
gotten rid of the relationship of personal attachment, and 
enjoys his personal freedom and independence in personality. 
The worker is now the owner of his own labor, and is able to 
freely dispose of his own labor. 
  Facts have shown that if the worker does not enjoy personal 
freedom and independence in personality, even if he and 
production materials are separated, and "has absolutely nothing 
to his name," it is impossible for him to sell his own labor as 
a commodity. Under different conditions, the laborer is not in 
the category of "having absolutely nothing to his name," but 
possesses some land and production tools; to pursue greater 
income, he will go out to sell his labor. In developed Western 
countries, many peasants farm on their land, while serving as 
workers at the same time. Quite a few of them are employed in 
industrial and commercial enterprises in cities and towns, 
making use of their leisure (weekends and after work) or with 
their dependents pursuing agricultural production at home, thus 
becoming the so-called people holding concurrent posts. There is 
a world of difference between such condition and that of the 
early stage of the capitalist society when the peasants and 
craftsmen were forced to enter factories to work after they had 
gone bankrupt. 
  Labor turning into commodity in contemporary China is the 
objective demand of socialist market economic development. 
Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee 
toward the end of 1978, earth-shaking changes have taken place 
in China's economic life. In a nutshell, China's economy has 
changed from the former basically unitary socialist public 
ownership to a socialist economy characterized by the dominant 
public ownership with the coexistence of multiple economic 
factors, and from the past noncommodity economy to the socialist 
commodity economy. Like all developed commodity economies, in 
the course of transiting toward the market economy, the pressing 
demand for turning labor into a commodity has already been set 
out objectively in present-day China. 
  If we put it that private ownership of labor by the worker 
creates a realistic possibility for labor to turn into a 
commodity, then it follows that the development of China's 
commodity economy or the market economy possesses the realistic 
possibility for labor to change into a commodity. We might as 
well conclude that this is the inevitable trend of socialist 
market economic development. 
  China's practice has evidenced the fact that the conversion 
of labor to a commodity is determined by the demand of the 
social productive forces in China. Labor is the most active and 
dynamic factor in productive forces, which will become very 
active as soon as they get rid of all sorts of personal bondage. 
When the development of the market economy increases demand for 
labor and raises the prices for labor, workers who pursues 
maximum individual income will increasingly enter the labor 
market from the relatively backward areas, countryside, and 
small towns to developed regions to work or do business. There, 
their income is higher than those who are engaged in farming 
exclusively, and they have learned production skills and 
accumulated production and operational experiences as well as 
information and means in becoming rich. At the same time, they 
have accumulated funds and would return to their home village to 
develop production. They would become rich themselves, and 
bring along the whole village to become well-to-do, thus 
promoting relatively backward areas to develop the productive 
force. Such a condition has often taken place in China in 
recent years. 
<H3>  Labor Tuning Into a Commodity Does No Harm to Workers' 
Status as Masters </H3>
  As mentioned above, the conversion of labor to a commodity 
is 
not determined by the separation of the worker and production 
materials, but the need of the socialist economic development as 
well as the worker's comparative interest. Under the condition 
of the worker possessing production materials, labor can be 
converted to a commodity, too. Under socialist conditions, the 
worker is the master of production materials of public ownership 
on the one hand; on the other, he is the one who sells his 
labor. Such double status is acceptable. 
  Under socialist condition, production materials are owned by 
the workers in entirety, but not by any individual worker, who 
as an individual is just one of the owners production materials 
of public ownership, and does not equate the entirety of 
workers, the union of all workers. That being the case, when 
every single worker sells his labor as a commodity to the state 
or enterprise that represents the entirety of workers, it does 
not mean that he is selling his labor to himself. If we put it 
that they have become employees on the grounds that they have 
sold their labor, it does not mean that they have become 
employees to their selves, but that they have become the 
employees of the state or enterprise that represents the 
entirety of workers. This being the case, the worker is one who 
shares production materials in their ownership, hence his status 
as one of the masters of the state or enterprise or one of the 
owners. At the same time, the employees are the ones who sell 
their labor to his own enterprise and state. That is not 
contradictory. 
  One idea believes that "reform the labor system, while 
gradually shaping a labor market" aims only at nonstate-owned 
enterprises. As to state-owned enterprises, its workers are the 
masters, and the issue of a labor market does not exist. This 
is a great misunderstanding. The labor market referred to in 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee decision 
is a unified labor market that includes economic factors of all 
sorts and categories across China. Especially in the 
state-owned economy, it is imperative for them to allocate 
manpower rationally from now on, genuinely implement 
two-direction selection, encourage the rational flow of 
personnel, and implement the best combination of labor and 
production materials. As to the nonstate-owned economy 
developed in recent decades, they have been the main body in the 
labor market from the very start, and have hired their employees 
through the market. The commodity quality of labor in the 
nonstate-owned economy is beyond doubt. Now it is time to 
change concept, have a clear picture that labor is commodity, 
and that it is state-owned enterprises that must change 
administrative to market allocation. 
  Another concept is that, should labor be a commodity, would 
it not be regarding workers themselves as commodities? We 
should know that the worker and labor are two different but 
interrelated concepts. The worker may sell his labor as a 
commodity, or may consume it himself, or let it lay idle. When 
a worker sells his labor, his labor becomes commodity. What the 
worker sells is his labor, not himself. This being the case, it 
is clear that workers will not become commodities.

<F P=106> ["Earnestly Study the `Decision' by the Third Plenary </F>
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee" column by Jia 
Qinglin, Fujian CPC Secretary and Governor: "Practice of 
Marching Toward Socialist Market Economy"] 
  [Text] The 14th CPC National Congress proposed the 
establishment of a socialist market economic structure and the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee further 
concretized and systemized this objective and principle and 
sketched the basic framework of the new economic structure, 
which was of farreaching significance to further emancipating 
and developing the productive forces; pushing forward reform, 
opening up, and the drive for modernization; and realizing the 
second-step strategic objective. The mission to initially 
establish a socialist market economic structure by the end of 
this century, as proposed by the party's central committee, is 
magnificent and achievable through hard work. 
  After 14 years of market-oriented reform and opening up, by 
and large, we possess the basic conditions for moving over to a 
socialist market economy. Some localities in Fujian, Quanzhou 
City for instance, which have been advancing at a faster 
development pace, have positively conducted comprehensive 
experiments with reform and opening up with markets as an 
orientation for many years, gradually smashed the bonds of the 
traditional planned economy, and initially presented the 
embryonic form of a socialist market economic structure. To sum 
up, it has been propped up by the following six basic pillars. 
  First, economic sectors have become diversified. 
An economic structure, with the sector under public ownership 
as a main body and the multiple sectors coexisting, is a 
prerequisite for the development of the socialist market 
economy. Public ownership is the core of the socialist economic 
system. Practicing a market economy under socialist conditions 
should and must always stick to the principle of taking the 
public sector as a main body and properly combining public 
ownership with the market economy. However, it is impossible for 
a unitary ownership to develop into a market economy. If there 
is only one ownership by the whole people, or there is only one 
owner -- the state then, in the entire economic operation, there 
will not be real commodities, exchange of commodities, and 
markets in a strict sense. Hence, in practicing a market 
economy under socialist conditions, it is a correct direction to 
stick to the principle of having multiple economic sectors with 
the public sector as the main body. Since the Third Plenary 
Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, people in Quanzhou 
have aimed at one principle -- they will courageously experiment 
on and put into practice everything that is beneficial to the 
development of socialist productive forces. They took the lead 
in breaking through the model of unitary public ownership, 
explored the possibility of practicing the ownership structure 
with the public sector as a main body and the coexistence of the 
multiple sectors, and encouraged the simultaneous development of 
state-owned, collective, individual, private, and foreign-funded 
economic sectors so that its economic pattern has undergone 
gradual changes. In the industrial area, township and town 
enterprises have sprung up everywhere and foreign-invested, 
individual, and private enterprises of nonpublic sectors have 
emerged in large multitudes. In 1992, there were 27,807 
industrial enterprises with 847,200 employees throughout the 
city, their total output value reached 15 billion yuan, and 
their taxes handed over to the state totalled 1.268 billion 
yuan. In the commercial area, they have also broken through the 
situation wherein business was monopolized by state and 
cooperative commercial sectors and individual business 
households and urban and rural trade fairs have been flourishing. 
  Second, markets are holding an increasingly important 
position in economic operations. Market mechanisms have 
exercised the role of a foundation in the allocation of 
resources, which is a major content of the socialist market 
economy. The market economy takes market as a foundation, a 
center, as well as an orientation. It calls for all economic 
activities to be directly or indirectly related to markets and 
regulated by market mechanisms. Fundamentally speaking, the 
transition from a planned to a market economic structure is a 
change in the pattern of resource allocation. Under the planned 
economic structure, the allocation of resources was achieved by 
a series of mandatory administrative plans. Under the 
conditions of a market economy, however, production is decided 
by social demands and the rational allocation of resources is 
achieved by markets in conjunction with production, circulation, 
distribution, and consumption. In the reform which takes the 
market as an orientation, Quanzhou paid attention to exercising 
the regulatory role of market mechanisms and gradually reduced 
the scope and changed the mode of planned management. In 
particular, as soon as township and town enterprises were set 
up, they were guided by markets, their essential elements 
including funds, technology, raw and semifinished materials, 
labor power, and so on were allocated and regulated through 
markets and their operational activities were targeted at 
markets. At present, the industrial products produced under 
mandatory planning in Quanzhou have been reduced from the 
previous 60 to two categories -- cigarettes and salt, and those 
produced under guidance planning have been reduced from 23 to 
eight categories. 
  In agricultural production, planning according to different 
varieties and seasons has been canceled except for the control 
of total demand and supply. The price formative mechanism was 
generally based on markets. Except for a small number of 
important commodities and labor services the prices of which 
were set by the state, most of the other commodities and labor 
services were regulated by markets. The prices of agricultural 
and sideline products, except for some traditional Chinese 
medicines, were all set by the markets, the control of grain 
prices was completely lifted, and the prices of industrial means 
of production were unified. In 1992, the portion of prices set 
by the state only accounted for 2.7 percent in the retail volume 
of social commodities, while the portion regulated by markets 
was 97 percent. 
  Markets are carriers [zai ti 6528 7555] of the operation of 
market mechanisms and the perfection of market mechanisms 
depends on a sound market system. In the market system, all 
commodities and production factors including land, funds, labor 
power, and technology must all enter the markets. Without a 
well-developed commodity market and a perfect market of 
production factors, there will not be a modern market economy. 
For many years, Quanzhou persisted in proceeding from the 
reality, mobilized the strength from various quarters in 
society, and dedicated itself to the cultivation and 
construction of markets. The commodity markets are being 
perfected day by day and a number of large-scale, powerful, and 
well-known specialized markets have been formed one after 
another, which have registered an annual transaction volume of 
several hundred million yuan and held a certain share in both 
domestic and foreign markets. Greater progress has also been 
made in the growth of markets of production factors including 
labor services, technology, information, funds, real estate, and 
so on. A fair, competitive, and orderly market system is being 
established deliberately. 
  Third, enterprises are operating more and more 
independently. Enterprises are the main body of a market 
economy and the independent operational activities of 
enterprises are an internal requirement for the development of a 
socialist market economic structure. Under the market economic 
structure, each enterprise is an independent producer and 
operator, which is a legal person that breaks away from its 
dependent relations with the government, operates independently, 
assumes sole responsibility for its own profits and losses, and 
effects self-development and self-constraint. All the principal 
parties which participate in market competition are equal. 
While giving a free hand to developing nonstate economic 
sectors, Quanzhou has positively promoted the transformation of 
operational mechanism in state-owned enterprises, further 
straightened out the relations between ownership and management, 
and enabled enterprises to enter the "ocean" of markets from the 
"embrace" of the government so that they will really become the 
main body of markets, operating independently and assuming sole 
responsibility for their own profits and losses. The city 
authority selected a large number of state-owned enterprises and 
pushed them into commodity markets, production factor markets, 
and property rights trading markets through contracts, leasing, 
auctions, grafting together by means of foreign capital, and 
transformation of operational mechanisms, thereby initially 
changing the situation whereby the government took up all 
responsibility for the state-owned enterprises. Up to now, 90 
percent of the state-owned enterprises throughout the city have 
practiced a contract system; 729 state and cooperative 
commercial enterprises have put into effect the policy of 
relaxing government control over operation, pricing, 
distribution, and employment; 21 enterprises have adopted the 
management methods of foreign-invested enterprises and township 
and town enterprises; 10 state-owned enterprises have practiced 
the system under which shares are held by staff and workers as 
well as legal persons within the enterprises; and 48 enterprises 
have become joint-ventures, of which 41 state-owned enterprises 
took the lead in the country in undergoing package 
transformation to have foreign capital grafted unto them. In 
this way, they have blazed a new path of transforming 
operational mechanisms for state-owned enterprises. 
  While exploring ways to establish a modern enterprise 
system, 
Quanzhou also positively explored effective organizational forms 
for state assets suited to the market economy, in accordance 
with the principle of separating government administration from 
enterprise and separating ownership from management. The city 
authorities have set up a state assets management committee and 
its working body, led by the mayor as committee director and 
participated in by various economic departments. Besides, a 
company to carry on the business of state assets has also been 
set up, so that a new-type state assets operation and management 
system has been initially established. 
  Fourth, the economy is advancing in the direction of 
indirect macroscopic regulation and control. Exercising 
macroscopic regulation and control by the government through 
economic policies and levers is a necessary means to guarantee 
the orderly and healthy growth of the market economy. The 
development of the socialist market economy calls for 
governments at all levels to conscientiously change government 
administrative functions and to change from: Relying mainly on 
direct to mainly on indirect regulation and control; relying 
mainly on management by mandatory planning to mainly on guidance 
planning; relying mainly on the use of administrative fiats to 
mainly on economic policies; relying mainly on the 
self-development of markets to mainly on the cultivation and 
organization of markets; and from relying mainly on divisions of 
money, resources, and targets to mainly on provision of 
guidance, consultancy, and services. On the basis of 
understanding market laws, the government should better use such 
economic levers as prices, interest rates, tariffs, and others 
as well as legal means to exercise macroeconomic regulation and 
control. In the course of market economic development, Quanzhou 
has seriously heeded economic laws and conscientiously brought 
about the transformation of government functions while pushing 
enterprises into the markets. It has defined the government 
functions as "planning, coordination, supervision, and service" 
and vividly summarized the government's relationship with 
enterprises as "welcoming their investment, collecting taxes for 
their profits, checking and acting upon their lawbreaking 
activities, and offering sympathy whey they become bankrupt." 
The government has provided services to enterprises chiefly in 
the areas of policies, infrastructure facilities, soft 
investment environment, and the building of spiritual 
civilization. In the course of separating government 
administration from enterprises, the city authorities have 
delegated administrative powers to lower levels, adopted the 
practice of making policy decisions and exercising regulation 
and control at different levels, returned powers to enterprises, 
let grass-roots units enjoy certain powers, and expanded the 
limits of authority for counties and townships in their economic 
management. Meanwhile, it also streamlined the administrative 
structure and diverted personnel to other jobs in light of the 
requirements for the development of the market economy. Across 
the city, 193 nonstanding bodies have been dissolved, more than 
20 government departments and institutions have set up entities, 
and 494 people have been dismissed from government organs or 
institutions to work elsewhere. While transforming government 
functions and streamlining the administrative structure, the 
city has established 37 intermediary organizations including 
technical and vocational training centers, offices for lawyers, 
accountants, and auditors, and so on. In addition, it has paid 
attention to exercising the role of chambers of commerce, 
associations of foreign entrepreneurs, and 160 trade 
associations, strengthened and perfected the management of 
trades, and provided enterprises with all kinds of services. 
  Fifth, the economy is oriented to exports. 
Openness is an essential characteristic of the market economy. 
The development of the socialist market economy must 
unswervingly practice the national policy of opening to the 
outside world, link the domestic market with the international 
market as quickly as possible, effect a two-way flow of various 
natural resources, let enterprises participate in international 
competition of their own accord, fully take the comparative 
advantage of international division of work and international 
exchanges, and form an extensively open pattern characterized by 
multiple levels, channels, and directions. Since reform and 
opening up, Quanzhou has fully exploited the advantages of being 
a well-known hometown of Overseas Chinese and its extremely 
close relations with foreign countries. It widely opened the 
gate and paved the way to attract foreign investors from Taiwan 
and other places through the help of Overseas Chinese, tapped 
both internal and external resources, combined foreign capital 
with foreign trade and foreign economic cooperation, vigorously 
developed the export- oriented economy, and blazed a new trial 
that "started from the path of three forms of import processing 
and compensation trade, got onto the way of township and town 
enterprises, embarked on the road of foreign-invested 
enterprises, proceeded to open up stretches upon stretches of 
land development, and finally led to a magnificent blueprint of 
a regional economy." By the end of 1992, a grand total of 2,398 
foreign-invested enterprises had been approved throughout the 
city, with a total investment amount of 12.615 billion yuan and 
a contract foreign investment amount of $1.888 billion. The 
scope and areas of foreign investment have been repeatedly 
expanded, the channels for absorbing foreign capital have 
continuously increased, township and town enterprises that have 
foreign capital grafted onto them have grown rapidly, and a 
major breakthrough has been made in the transformation of 
state-owned enterprises using foreign capital. In the course of 
increasing the use of foreign capital, relatively great 
development has also been attained in foreign trade. In 1992, 
the city's total value of export goods amounted to 3.11 billion 
yuan, representing an increase of 37 times as against 1979. The 
proportion of total export value in the city's GNP has been 
elevated from 6.61 percent in 1979 to 27 percent today. There 
are a dozen categories of products with export value exceeding 
100 million yuan, including garments, packing materials, shoes, 
umbrellas, ceramics, knitwear, plastic articles, electronic and 
electrical appliances, leatherware, gloves, stone products, tea, 
among other things. Quanzhou's export-oriented economy accounts 
for over 50 percent of its national economy as a whole and its 
economic activities depend more and more on the international 
markets. 
  Sixth, the process of standardized social management 
has begun. A market economy is, in essence, an economy of 
laws. A complete legal system and a perfect social insurance 
system are reliable guarantees for the institution of a 
socialist market economic structure. Ruling by law is an 
inherent requirement as well as an organic component of market 
economic order. In the arena of markets, the authority and 
responsibility of enterprises and individuals should be 
confirmed and protected by laws, the market order should be 
standardized and maintained by laws, and the state's regulation 
and control over markets should also be achieved on the strength 
of laws. At present, a legal system that is adapted to the 
socialist market economic structure has not been completely 
instituted, the market rules are far from sound, and there is 
even a total blank in some areas. In developing the socialist 
market economy, Quanzhou has experienced a development course 
from a confused to orderly and from an unstandardized to 
standardized progress. According to the principle of giving 
consideration to "development first and standardization later, 
relaxation first and perfection later, and support first and 
profit later," the city has persisted in making experiments in 
everything, conscientiously summing up experiences, correcting 
mistakes in good time, standardizing measures in an appropriate 
manner, and deliberately bringing the market economy into the 
orbit of standardization and legalization. 
  The institution of a social insurance system is an 
objective requirement of the socialist market economic 
development. Without a sound social insurance system, it will be 
difficult to bring about unity of efficiency and fairness. In 
the course of developing the socialist market economy, Quanzhou 
has always taken the institution of a social insurance system as 
an important task. In 1986, it started insurance for job 
awaiting and retirement for enterprises and, on this basis, 
gradually expanded the social insurance business to radiate in 
all directions and at deep levels. At present, the city's 
insurance business has a coverage of 131 items in three major 
categories including the insurance of job awaiting. A total of 
1,672 state-owned, collective, and foreign- invested enterprises 
have offered unified social retirement insurance to 105,000 
personnel, 108,700 staff and workers from 1,248 enterprises 
participated in job awaiting insurance, and 12,500 staff and 
workers from 313 foreign-invested enterprises participated in 
employer responsibility insurance. There are 10 insurance 
companies in the city. The social insurance system has 
gradually solidified and is advancing in the direction of 
socialization and standardization. 
  Quanzhou's courageous exploration into the direction of the 
socialist market economy has initially broken a path for the 
development of this economy and, at the same time, remarkably 
augmented its economic strength. During the past 14 years from 
1978 to 1992, the city's GNP and total industrial and 
agricultural output value increased by 5.59 and 7.01 times 
respectively and its national income and financial revenues 
increased by 5.2 and 11.68 times respectively, showing a yearly 
average increase of 14.42, 16.02, 13.92, and 19.89 percent 
respectively. The city's GNP quadrupled that of 1978 in 1992. 
Since 1993, particularly since the implementation of the 
important central measure of intensifying macroeconomic 
regulation and control, the city has focused its attention on 
expediting development by deepening reform, opening wider to the 
outside world, transforming mechanisms, optimizing structures, 
and enhancing economic results, with a view to continuously 
maintaining the vigorous development momentum in the national 
economy. Today, the people throughout the city are full of 
confidence in their advance toward the goal of moderate 
prosperity by 1995 and the strategic objective of further 
quadrupling the GNP by the year 2000. 
  As a national comprehensive experimental reform and opening 
up zone, Fujian has conscientiously summed up the successful 
experience obtained in Quanzhou and other localities in 
exercising the role of markets. After audacious experiments and 
explorations, it should and can accelerate its pace in 
establishing the socialist market economic structure. We are 
now seriously studying and implementing the guidelines of the 
"Decisions" adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee; stepping up formulation of an overall plan 
for the establishment of a socialist market economic structure 
in the province; concentrating efforts on furthering reform; 
expediting the transformation of operational mechanisms; 
positively cultivating a unified, open, competitive, and orderly 
market system; conscientiously changing government functions; 
pushing forward organizational reform; taking proper control of 
instituting a legal system and a social insurance system; and 
vigorously intensifying the building of spiritual civilization 
suited to the socialist market economy, to lay down a solid 
foundation for initially establishing the socialist market 
economic structure in Fujian by the end of this century.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Pi Shuyi (4122 2885 5030) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Jiang Jun (1203 6511)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 30 Jan (XINHUA) -- This year, China will 
reform its mode of customs supervision and administration by 
introducing a comprehensive customs inspection system and a 
corresponding reform of the system of customs processing. 
  Addressing a national conference of customs directors on 30 
January, Qian Guanlin, director of the PRC General 
Administration of Customs, said: The focus of customs operation 
reform this year is to introduce the customs inspection system. 
Customs will expand the time and space of supervision and 
control by basing its import and export supervision and control 
on enterprise control and accounts auditing in order to 
facilitate passage at ports and points of entry, to make 
supervision and control more scientific and effective, and to 
better suit the expansion of opening up to the outside world and 
the development of an export-oriented economy. 
  He pointed out: It is necessary to change the traditional 
concept of regarding the customs simply as a "gatekeeper" and to 
change the traditional mode of over-concentrating manpower, 
material resources, and means of supervision and control on the 
handling of passage at customs in ports and points of entry -- 
which involves only a narrow and small space and a short 
duration of time. 
  It is obvious that the old mode of supervision and control 
can no longer meet the needs of the rapidly developing 
situation: In 1993, the volume of import and export goods under 
the supervision and control of customs nationwide amounted to 
347 million metric tons, an increase of 23.6 percent over 1992; 
customs also inspected the luggage of 100.05 million inbound and 
outbound visitors, an increase of nearly 9.7 percent over 1992. 
  It has been learned that the General Administration of 
Customs has received State Council approval to establish an 
inspection department to exercise unified control over and to 
coordinate customs inspection work nationwide. The measures for 
implementing the customs inspection system will soon be 
distributed to subordinate units for implementation. 
  Correspondingly, the system of processing through customs 
will be further reformed. Qian Guanlin said: It is necessary 
to reform the system of customs declaration and cultivate the 
customs declaration service market. The State Council has 
determined that examination and approval of customs brokers will 
be administered by customs. It is necessary to gradully build 
specialized customs broker agencies into business entities 
bearing the nature of social intermediate organizations 
responsible not only to enterprises but also to customs. It is 
necessary to begin studying and to gradually establish a system 
for administering customs clearances by consignees and 
consignors of import-export goods, as well as by their agents; 
it is necessary to study and establish a customs clearance 
management standard based on risk analysis; it is necessary to 
quickly establish a customs clearance method suitable to 
expressways; it is necessary to study the comprehensive 
application of electronic data exchange; it is necessary to 
further expand the results of the reform of joint inspection of 
sea-transported goods and popularize them throughout China this 
year; it is necessary to revise in a timely manner customs' 
method of supervising and controlling mailed goods by 
concentrating on supervision and control, in order to move in 
the direction of international practice.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Qin Shaoxiang (4440 1421 4161): "Li </F>
Yining, Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress Standing 
Committee Law Committee, Talks About China's First `Securities 
Law' Which Is To Be Promulgated Soon"] 
  [Text] Securities issuing and transacting has become an 
important component part of the socioeconomic life of our 
country. Correspondingly, the legislative work related to 
securities is also going on in an intensive manner. Recently, 
Professor Li Yining, vice chairman of the National People's 
Congress [NPC] Standing Committee Law Committee and responsible 
person in the Securities Law Drafting Group, told this reporter 
about the progress of the work in this respect, expressing his 
own opinions on some questions related to the drafting of the 
"Securities Law" in which many people had shown interest. 
  The Securities Law will be the first economic law which 
has not been drafted by a government institution. According to 
the equity principle for all stocks, all joint-stock investors 
will enjoy the same protection and are also subject to the same 
constraints. In the "Securities Law," there will be no such 
terms as shares owned by the state, shares held by legal 
persons, and shares held by individuals. 
  According To Li Yining, the "Securities Law" is being 
drafted 
by experts organized by the NPC Standing Committee Financial and 
Economic Committee. They began drafting in August 1992 and 
submitted the seventh version, which they drafted on the basis 
of intensive investigations and studies, to the NPC Standing 
Committee for deliberation in August 1993. The revised version 
will soon be submitted once again to the NPC Standing Committee 
for further deliberation. 
  China is a socialist country, so people are concerned about 
whether special protection should be given to state-owned stocks 
and whether it is necessary to specify which stocks are 
negotiable and which are not negotiable. Li Yining said: What 
matters in a market economy is fair competition. In the 
securities market, no stockholder should enjoy special powers 
and all investors should stand on an equal footing. Therefore, 
the equity principle is applicable. Since all people proceed 
from the same starting line, the legitimate rights and interests 
of the state-owned stocks, legal-person-owned stocks, 
individual-held stocks, and foreign- investor-held stocks should 
be protected alike in the securities market and should also be 
subject to the same constraints. No stockholder can enjoy any 
special treatments or prerogatives because of their nature. If 
any special stipulations must be made for state-owned stocks, 
they can be included in the "State-Owned Assets Management Law," 
and the provisions concerned may include the methods of turning 
the existing state assets into stocks, the transfer and 
management of state-owned stocks, and the proportion of 
state-owned stocks in certain trades. In the "Securities Law 
(Draft)," there are only such terms as stocks, the distribution 
of stocks, and stock transactions and there are no such terms as 
state-owned stocks, legal-person-owned stocks, or 
individual-owned stocks. The equity principle also indicates 
that all stocks are equal and the same stocks bear the same 
rights and responsibilities. That is to say, any stock-holding 
investor can transfer the stocks through the stock exchanges 
according to his own wishes; at the same time, he can also 
receive dividends according to the stocks they hold. Thus, there 
will never exist such a situation in which some investors can 
transfer the stocks they hold but the stocks held by other 
investors are not negotiable. 
  In China, it is necessary to establish certain trading 
places outside the stock exchanges. Not allowing transactions 
outside the stock exchanges will hinder the development of the 
joint-stock system and may also lead to an increase in 
underground transactions. 
  Li Yining said: In the process of drafting the "Securities 
Law," the second major controversial issue was the approach to 
transactions outside the stock exchanges. He said: A distinct 
characteristic of the joint-stock system is the impossibility of 
returning stocks to the enterprises issuing the stocks. If an 
investor does not want to continue to hold the stocks the only 
thing he or she can do is to transfer the stocks to other 
people. This then gives rise to the issue of stock transfers. 
The stock exchanges are places where securities transactions 
are conducted. However, as there are only a very small number of 
stock exchanges, only a limited number of companies can have 
their stock listed on the exchanges. If people holding stocks 
in some companies cannot return the stocks to those companies 
and cannot transfer the stocks on the exchanges, then 
underground transactions will become unavoidable. Thus, the 
legitimate rights and interests of stockholding investors will 
not be protected. Moreover, underground stock transactions can 
cause sharp falls in stock prices and can thus put great 
pressure on the companies and even cause panic among workers in 
the companies concerned. Therefore, in China, it is necessary 
to establish some trading places outside the stock exchanges. 
In the discussions, some people held different opinions on 
establishing trading places outside the stock exchanges. Li 
Yining held that applications for transactions outside the 
exchanges should first be lodged by securities dealing 
institutions and trading places can be established only with the 
approval of the authorities in charge. Some people may be 
worried that stocks in a large number of irregular joint-stock 
companies may appear in such trading places outside the stock 
exchanges. Li Yining said that such a situation would not 
appear because the securities dealing institutions are 
responsible for examining all stocks to be traded through their 
hands. In the future, the control should be strictly exercised 
only when a joint-stock company is being set up. If a company 
has been set up, then it must be regarded as a regular one. If 
the stocks in the same liability-limited company are traded both 
in the stock exchanges and in the trading places outside the 
exchanges, will there be two different prices? Li Yining said 
that such a situation would not arise either. He said: The 
"Securities Law (Draft)" specifies that the stocks in a company 
which issues a limited number of stocks can only be traded in 
one trading place. If the company is listed on a stock exchange, 
then before the listing, all transactions outside the exchange 
will have to be stopped within the specified time limit. In 
China, transactions outside the stock exchanges are necessary. 
Without such transactions, the development of the joint-stock 
system will be hindered and this can also give rise to 
increasing underground transactions and other consequent 
problems. 
  The association of securities companies is a 
self-disciplining organization of the institutions engaged in 
securities transactions and disputes between different 
securities companies, or between a securities company and its 
customers, can be arbitrated by the association. 
  At present, the issuing of and trading in securities has 
become an important part of the socioeconomic life in our 
country. Who should play an arbitration role if disputes arise 
in such activities? Li Yining said: The association of 
securities companies is a self-disciplining organization of the 
institutions engaged in securities transactions. A company 
engaged in buying and selling securities must join the 
association. In the process of drafting the "Securities Law" 
there were different opinions on whether the association should 
play an arbitration role. Some people held that the arbitration 
function should be performed by the stock exchanges; others held 
that this should be the function of the government institution 
in charge of securities business; and still others held that 
arbitration should be effected by the association of securities 
companies. What relationship is there with the law courts? Li 
Yining said: If disputes arise between different securities 
companies or between a securities company and its customers, 
they can be handled by the arbitration committee of the 
association of the securities industry and the arbitrations made 
by the association will not be contradictory to the handling in 
the law courts. This is because if the parties involved in a 
dispute have ever concluded any arbitration agreements in the 
process of securities distribution and transaction, the 
arbitration made by the arbitration committee will be the final 
ruling. If no such arbitration agreement is signed in advance, 
they can still conclude a belated arbitration agreement and 
apply for arbitration by the arbitration committee or they can 
file suit in court rather than applying for arbitration. 
  As all citizens have the right to make investments, the 
"Securities Law" should not specify which people are prohibited 
from buying and selling stocks. As for whether or not civil 
servants in state organs can buy and sell stocks, the 
stipulation can be made in other laws, regulations, or 
policies. 
  As to whether or not it is necessary for the "Securities 
Law" 
to include a provision about the involvement of civil servants 
in state organs in trading stocks, Li Yining said that there 
were five opinions on this issue. The first opinion held that 
the law should specify that all civil servants are prohibited 
from buying and selling stocks. The second opinion held that as 
civil servants are also citizens, they should have the right to 
buy stocks and whether or not they actually do is a question of 
their self-discipline rather than whether or not this violates 
the law. The third opinion held that it is necessary to prevent 
civil servants from gaining stocks by abusing their powers and 
such activities should mainly be prevented in the primary 
market; as for activities in the secondary market, transactions 
are all fair so there is no need to exercise restraints. The 
fourth opinion held that only high-ranking civil servants 
bearing responsibilities in leading positions and civil servants 
working in securities management institutions should be 
prohibited from buying and selling stocks and that there is no 
need to prohibit ordinary civil servants from such activities by 
means of a law. The fifth opinion held that three systems 
should be adopted to restrain civil servants' involvement in 
buying and selling stocks, namely: The system of reporting 
individual property, the system of making public the individual 
actions of buying and selling stocks, and the system of 
securities custody during office terms. Li Yining held that as 
all citizens have the right to make investments, it is improper 
that a law includes provisions prohibiting some people from 
buying stocks because this sounds like depriving these people of 
their civil rights. What should be prohibited in the securities 
market are illegal securities transactions and the behavior of 
abusing powers and harming the public interests. In China, it 
is not necessary to write the question related to stock 
transactions involving civil servants into the "Securities Law." 
Relevant provisions can be written into other laws, 
regulations, and policies. 
  After the "Securities Law" is adopted, what will happen to 
the stocks that have been issued before and the 
securities-dealing institutions of all types? Li Yining said: 
The stocks issued by enterprises before the adoption of the 
"Securities Law" will continue to be valid but will be subject 
to the constraints of this law. We can assure stockholders that 
they can set their minds at rest because the adoption of the law 
does not mean that the stocks issued in the past will all become 
invalid. However, the institutions engaged in securities 
transactions, including securities companies, securities service 
companies, and securities assessment companies, will have to be 
reregistered after the "Securities Law" comes into force before 
they can continue their business. In addition, the previous 
laws and regulations formulated by the State Council and some 
local governments will have to be adjusted in line with the 
"Securities Law" if there are any contradictions.

  [Text] Beijing, 29 Jan (XINHUA) -- The State Council 
recently issued a circular on further strengthening macroscopic 
regulation and control over investments in fixed assets. 
  The circular notes: While China made new headway in reform, 
opening up, economic construction, and other areas last year, 
problems such as excessive growth of investment and increasingly 
larger size of construction projects, as well as sluggish 
improvement of investment patterns remained unresolved. Thus, 
leading cadres in all regions and departments must fully and 
correctly understand and implement the guidelines laid down by 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; 
correctly handle the relationship among reform, development, and 
stability; and shift the focus of work to readjusting investment 
patterns and achieving higher returns, instead of being obsessed 
with fighting for investment money, launching new projects, and 
expanding construction size in disregard of objective 
conditions. During the course of building our socialist market 
economic system, we must have strict macroscopic regulation and 
control over investment in fixed assets. 
  The circular stresses that financial and material resources 
must be pooled together and used to ensure the needs of priority 
projects. It says: All regions and departments should now 
prioritize their construction projects, which were screened and 
approved last year, give priority to completing the major 
projects and ensuring the needs of major investment and 
unfinished projects. For those projects ordered last year to 
stop or be postponed, they must not be reinstated without 
authorization. Even infrastructure projects and capital 
industrial projects must proceed rationally according to the 
state policy that they must be rationally planned with all 
factors taken into consideration, that their efficiency must be 
heeded, and that they must not be launched unless they have the 
ability to do so. Resources should be pooled and used wherever 
they are needed most. Efforts must be made to prevent reckless 
and redundant constructions. State-set amounts of investment in 
fixed assets must be strictly followed and not exceeded. There 
shall be no additional allotments at various levels. Treasuries 
and banks at various levels may not allot funds or extend loans 
for nonbudgetary construction projects. Beginning early this 
year, governments, banks, and enterprises at various levels 
should draw up quarterly allotment plans and make sure that 
funds are available for priority state projects every month. 
Local authorities must ensure the amounts of self-raised funds 
for major state projects. It is strictly forbidden for bank 
loans and illegally raised funds to be regarded as sources of 
self-raised funds. Funds raised by local people's governments, 
relevant authorities, and enterprises must be used on priority 
state projects and major technological upgrading projects. All 
projects for which funds are not available must proceed more 
slowly, or even be discontinued or postponed with resolve. 
Central treasuries may not earmark any money for those projects 
for which self-raised funds are unavailable, and banks may not 
extend loans to them. 
  The circular states: New projects must be strictly screened, 
the number of construction projects must be curtailed, the 
management of screening and approving projects must be 
tightened, and projects must be properly planned. To prevent 
the launching of more construction, in principle no more new 
projects will be approved this year. For projects launched 
without preapproval, the relevant construction units and leaders 
will have their responsibilities investigated. Banks also may 
not support unauthorized projects through extending them loans 
on a piecemeal basis. From now on, new projects may not be 
launched unless they meet these three requirements: First, 
there shall not be costless investment. In other words, a new 
project may not be launched unless a certain percentage of 
capital has been ensured. Second, loans to be used as working 
funds may not be used for investment. Third, a new project must 
have sufficient working funds, and projects without working 
funds may not be launched. People's governments of all 
provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the 
central government's jurisdiction, and cities authorized to draw 
up independent development plans may not laterally decentralize 
[heng xiang fen san 2897 0686 0433 2414] their authority of 
approving new projects. Except for projects which state-class 
developmental zones have the right to approve as authorized by 
the State Council, and for projects which enterprises have the 
right to approve as prescribed by the "Regulations Governing the 
Change of Operating Mechanisms in State-Owned Industrial 
Enterprises," the authority of approving local projects must be 
in the hands of planning commissions (or planning and economic 
commissions) and economic commissions (or economic and trade 
commissions) under the local people's governments. While 
provincial and lower-level people's governments have the 
authority to approve projects, their authority may not exceed 
their capacity for making overall balance, much less should they 
delegate the authority to other lower-level departments. The 
State Planning Commission should work with other relevant 
departments and regions in drawing up special plans for hot-spot 
products [re dian chan pin 3583 7820 3934 0756] and projects. 
The locations for these projects should be well conceived and 
redundant construction projects must be avoided. From now on, 
projects must be approved on the basis of the state's 
intermediate and long-range plans. 
  The circular says: It is necessary to tighten control over 
the sources of capital and to be strict in the management of 
loans for investment in fixed assets. The people's banks must 
be strict in controlling the total amount of loans for fixed 
assets investment and in channeling investment to desired areas. 
As state-fixed assets loan plans are mandatory plans, the banks 
at all levels must implement them strictly without exception. 
Momentary organizations are not permitted to extend loans for 
fixed-assets investment by borrowing from other banks, nor are 
they allowed to use bank loans to supplement the shortages of 
self-raised funds. Nonbanking financial institutions are not 
permitted to grant loans for fixed assets investment without 
approval from higher authorities; nor are they allowed to extend 
loans for newly launched construction projects without the 
approval of the State Council and the State Planning Commission. 
All localities and departments must strictly implement the 
state-assigned securities issuance plan. In issuing bonds and 
shares, they must strictly abide by the state- stipulated 
examination and approval procedures. They shall not be allowed 
to arbitrarily expand the scale of bond issuance and of 
experimentation in the shareholding system and to raise capital 
through high-interest rates under the pretext of carrying out 
internal experimentation in the shareholding system. They must 
continue to strictly implement the regulations governing fund- 
raising management enacted by the State Council, and all illegal 
fund-raising activities shall be strictly prohibited. Financial 
departments must strengthen the management of extra budgetary 
funds and adopt specific measures to streamline and rectify the 
practice of using government funds for investment outside the 
plan by resorting to method of extending credit. In line with 
the unified plan of the people's bank, banks at all levels must 
continue stepping up the work of checking illegal borrowing. 
International commercial loan borrowing for construction 
projects (including commercial loans and export credit) must be 
done in strict compliance with the state plan on utilization of 
foreign capital. Such borrowing must be placed under mandatory 
planning, and no exception is permitted. 
  The circular stresses: It is necessary to strengthen the 
management of real estate development and construction as well 
as the management of development zone construction. Investment 
in real estate development and construction in all areas must be 
incorporated into the state fixed assets investment plan, and 
the scale of loan must also be incorporated into the state 
credit plan and fixed assets investment plan. Banks are not 
allowed to grant loans for real estate development and 
construction projects that are outside the plan. The focus of 
real estate development and construction is to coordinate with 
the construction of commercial housing to solve housing 
shortages being undertaken in the course of reform of the 
housing system. In carrying out the "live-in-peace project" 
this year, it is necessary to focus on the preparatory work and 
other related plans. The project should be carried out step by 
step in accordance with our financial capability, and the 
practice of rushing headlong into mass action should be avoided. 
Construction of new development zones will not be approved in 
principle this year. Resumption of construction of the 
development zones screened and canceled last year shall not be 
permitted. Tourism facilities, guesthouses, offices, and other 
projects whose construction is absolutely needed to support 
opening to the outside world must be reported for approval 
according to stipulated procedures. 
  The circular states: It is necessary to strengthen guidance 
for and standardized management of projects directly invested by 
foreign businessmen. It is necessary to strictly implement the 
State Council's stipulations on tightening management of foreign 
investment and actively encourage and guide foreign investors to 
invest in domestic infrastructure facility projects and basic 
industry projects. Where a state-owned enterprise sells its 
shares to overseas investors or forms a joint venture or a 
cooperative enterprise with a foreign investor with its 
remaining assets, the procedures regarding submitting the matter 
for approval must be strictly followed. The enterprise's assets 
will be assessed by a qualified assets assessment organization 
and will have to verified by a department for the administration 
of state-owned assets. The value of foreign investment in the 
form of materials shall also be verified by an intermediary 
notary organ acknowledged by both parties to the joint venture. 
It is not permitted to use bank loans to pay for the registered 
capital of foreign investors nor is the Chinese side allowed to 
serve as guarantor for foreign investment loans. The Chinese 
side is not allowed to resort to extending loans and issuing 
bonds or to other forms to guarantee the rate of returns for 
foreign investors who are party to a joint venture. When a 
foreign-invested project applies for overseas loans in the name 
of a joint venture, the loan must be incorporated into the state 
foreign debt plan if a domestic organization is required to 
serve as a guarantor or if assets are used as a mortgage. 
  The circular issues the following calls: It is necessary 
to strengthen leadership over macroeconomic regulation and 
control over investment. The people's governments of all 
provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the 
central government, and cities with provincial-level economic 
decision-making authority should have their vice governors (vice 
chairmen or vice mayors) assume personal responsibility over 
this work. The planning, financial, banking, and auditing 
departments should coordinate closely with one another in 
promptly studying solutions for major problems of fixed assets 
investment; they must make periodic checks to determine whether 
key projects are ensured and whether funds are in place, and to 
also find out the situation regarding the investment scale, 
investment examination and approval, and newly launched 
projects, and must promptly report to the relevant departments 
the results of their analyses and their suggestions for dealing 
with problems. The State Planning Commission must strengthen 
leadership, supervision, and checking regarding the work of 
exercising overall control over investment. 
  The circular points out: Strict control over the scale of 
fixed assets investment is crucial to the smooth progress of 
reform and the sustained and healthy growth of the national 
economy this year. Our important tasks this year are to seize 
the opportunities, deepen the reform, open up wider to the 
outside world, promote development, and maintain stability. All 
localities and departments must coordinate efforts and unite as 
one in handling well the relationship between reform and 
development on the one hand and stability on the other to ensure 
the national economy's sustained, rapid, and healthy development.

<F P=106> [By Cary Huang, China Editor] </F>
  [Text] China is set to target decreases in both economic 
growth and inflation this year in a bid to rein in the 
overheated economy. 
  The decision was made by the ruling Communist Party 
leadership since amending its radical development strategy for 
1994 by putting greater emphasis on social stability. 
  Chinese sources yesterday said concerned government 
departments under the cabinet were ordered to make all-out 
efforts to achieve the targets, which set both the annual 
economic growth and inflation rates under 10 percent. 
  Following a crucial decision made by the Politburo to give 
social stability priority, the State Council amended its overall 
development plan to adhere to the strategic change made by the 
party's top policymaking body. 
  China's senior party leaders, including party chief Jiang 
Zemin, Premier Li Peng, vice-premiers Zhu Rongji and Zou Jiahua 
have--in their recent inspections to regions--urged local 
officials to follow Beijing's line. 
  "Both the central ministries and regional governments were 
urged to pay close attention to the leadership's newly set 
strategy and to take the overall social and economic situation 
into consideration when working out their own strategies," an 
informed source said. 
  "The overall target for economic growth and price increases 
should be reined in under one digit and should not go higher 
than 10 percent," the source said. 
  The strategy rethink by the Politburo, first reported by The 
Hongkong Standard and confirmed by Jiang Zemin in a speech to 
non-Communist Party leaders over the weekend, decided to play 
down the emphasis on pace of economic growth and reform. 
  Jiang, who is also Chinese president, said the Politburo had 
decided on a four-point principle for economic development this 
year, which said "to seize opportunities, deepen reforms, boost 
development and guarantee stability". 
  The Politburo had late last year formulated a three-point 
strategy that read "to seize opportunities, deepen reforms and 
speed up development". 
  The inclusion of guaranteeing social stability and the 
substitution of "speeding up development" by "boosting 
development" underlines a significant change of mind by the 
leadership. 
  "It is not appropriate at this time to bring up the slogan 
of 
`speeding up the pace of reform and hastening economic 
development'," the source quoted a report as saying. 
  The government has tried over the past year to strengthen 
macrocontrol over the national economy in order to address 
problems arising from the economic overheating. 
  The report said Beijing had urged localities to implement 
the 
government policy to deepen reforms, while combating price 
increases under the call for "a continuous, faster and healthier 
economic development."

<F P=106> [By Zhao Renfang: "China Successfully Issues Global Bonds"] </F>
  [Text] New York, February 3 (XINHUA) -- China has 
successfully issued one billion U.S. dollar global bonds. 
  According to Jin Renqing, Chinese vice minister of finance, 
the proceeds of this bond issue will be used to finance projects 
in sectors of energy, transportation and communications in China. 
  The one billion U.S. dollar global bond was launched on 
February 2 and broad distribution, one of the key objectives of 
the Ministry of Finance, which represents China, has been 
achieved, Jin noted. 
  "The success of the global debt offering is to set up a 
bench-mark for other Chinese financial institutions to tap 
international capital markets, in particular, the U.S. market in 
the future," said Jin at a press conference held today at 
Merrill Lynch's New York headquarters. 
  The Chinese Ministry of Finance has worked for nearly a year 
in preparing for this global bond offering. Last year, U.S. 
credit-rating agencies were invited to China to reassess the 
sovereign credit rating on Chinese foreign debt. The U.S. firm 
Moody's raised China's sovereign foreign debt credit-rating from 
BAA1 to A3 while another agency Fitch assigned an A-rating for 
China, whose economy continues to thrive. 
  Soon after, in the name of the People's Republic of China, 
the Ministry of Finance successfully issued a euro-yen bond in 
the eurobond markets and a U.S. dollar dragon bond in Asian 
market. 
  Zhu Guangyao, division chief, World Bank Department of the 
ministry, told XINHUA that the offering of this one billion 
dollar global bond was the largest amount China has ever had. 
  Before the launching of China's first global bond offering, 
a 
delegation of the Finance Ministry has visited 12 major cities 
in Asia, Europe and the United States for road show in the last 
two weeks. 
  "International investors have given very strong response," 
Jin added, "through this offering, we have strongly felt that 
international investors have expressed keen interest while 
showing confidence in the future development of China." 
  A registration statement relating to these securities, which 
has been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 
became effective today. 
  According to Zhu, about 60 percent of the bonds were sold at 
the United States, and the rest sold at other global markets. 
  Merrill Lynch and other international security firms have 
cooperated to form a strong syndicate group for this offering. 
  Vice Minister Jin said that China will tap the international 
capital markets on a regular basis in the future in accordance 
with the funding requirements for China's economic construction 
and conditions of the international marketplace.

  [Text] Beijing, 1 Feb (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- After 
several years of steady development, a stock exchange network 
composed of stock exchange centers, securities companies, 
securities business departments, and stock transaction agencies 
has taken shape in the stock market in mainland China, and up to 
150,000 people are working in this profession. 
  It has been learned that the mainland achieved greater 
development in securities administration last year. The State 
Council promulgated the first group of laws and regulations on 
securities management -- "Interim Regulations on the 
Administration of Stock Issue and Transactions" -- to provide 
the stock market with an important legal basis and guarantee. 
  At present, apart from establishing the two stock exchanges 
in Shanghai and Shenzhen, two national stock exchange quotation 
systems have been set up in the mainland. In order to guarantee 
rapid, accurate, and highly effective stock transactions, more 
than 17 regional stock exchange centers -- dealing primarily 
with such transaction items as treasury bonds, local enterprise 
bonds, and investment funds -- and 86 professional companies 
running the business of various securities are being built in 
the mainland. In addition, more than 370 credit investment 
companies have set up securities business departments and there 
are over 2,000 stock transaction agencies spreading all over the 
country. Using such advanced means as computers, this stock 
exchange network helps investors purchase all sorts of 
securities and facilitates stock transactions at any time.

  [Text] Beijing, February 4 (XINHUA) -- China will float a 
total of 5.5 billion yuan worth of shares for domestic investors 
in 1994, roughly the same amount as the previous year. 
  The figure was decided upon in light of the actual capacity 
of the current domestic market, said Ma Zhongzhi, a senior 
official with the State Council's Securities Committee, to the 
press here today. 
  He refused to disclose this year's projected sum for B 
shares 
targeted for overseas investors but said that the issuance of B 
shares will still be limited to Shanghai and Shenzhen. 
  The securities authorities will, as last year, give each 
province a certain quota of stocks to issue drawn from the total 
amount. However, the examination and assessment of the applying 
enterprises will be stricter to ensure the implementation of the 
state industrial policy as well as the quality of the listed 
company, according to Ma. 
  Allocation of this year's quota has not been revealed to the 
localities, but Ma assured that the securities authorities will 
arrange the flotation in a "proper and measured" manner. 
  China announced the issuing of 5 billion yuan in stocks last 
year. However, the flotation did not start until August, after 
the 30 billion yuan in state treasury bonds was sold out. 
  The continuous and fast-paced listings since the latter half 
of the year quickly drained the capital pool of individual 
investors and deflated their enthusiasm about stock buying, 
which resulted in the doldrums of the stocks market over the 
past several months. 
  Ma said the state's freeze on trading of the 
institution-held 
shares will not be removed before relevant regulations and rules 
are worked out. 
  "We will see that the institution-held shares issued over 
the 
past few years do not flood into the market all at once, even 
after we have the regulations worked out," Ma said. 
  The trading of state shares is more complex, Ma said. 
Lifting the ban requires time, although it is the goal. 
  At present, when a state enterprise becomes a share-holding 
firm, the shares it issues should be in three forms, owned by 
the state, institution and individuals, with the proportion 
roughly 5:3:2. 
  At present, all the stocks trading in Shanghai and Shenzhen 
are individual shares. Meanwhile only six or seven 
institutional shares are being traded in a special market in 
Beijing on a trial basis. But the state stopped approval of more 
such shares listed in the market due to a lack of proper laws 
and rules. 
  Ma said that the state also will strictly ban the issuance 
of 
stocks by enterprises to their own employees before the state 
publishes relevant rules to guide the activity.

<F P=106> ["Random Talk on Economic Life" by staff reporter Wang </F>
Yantian (3769 1750 3944): "Let Work Force Enter the Market"] 
  [Text] The "Decision" adopted by the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee proposed "reforming the labor 
system and gradually establishing a market for the work force." 
  How did the "labor market" change into a "market for the 
work 
force"? Is there any difference between the two? 
  A market for work force is a new employment mechanism. 
Instead of adopting administrative means to directly control 
the distribution and flow of the work force, the state will 
allow enterprises to independently employ workers and the 
workers to chose their employers. 
  The biggest difference between a market for the work force 
and a labor market is that the former is a new type of 
employment mechanism while the latter is merely a labor or 
information exchange. 
  Zhejiang's Wenzhou, one of the cities in China which took 
the 
lead in developing a market economy, also marched ahead of 
others in developing a market for the work force. Wenzhou 
implemented an "enterprise staff system" in 1992, regarding all 
employed laborers in the city as enterprise workers. The 
ownership of the enterprises where they worked could be 
different, but the workers enjoyed the same status, irrespective 
of their positions. All kinds of enterprises could issue rules 
for employment in the market for the work force. When the 
workers are employed, they only have to go through the 
procedures of signing the contract and insurance. Workers could 
also flow between enterprises of different ownership, with the 
approval of both sides. They only had to transfer their 
insurance at the social insurance office. 
  The administrative departments here no longer exercised 
direct control over distribution of laborers or restricted their 
identity. The workers enterprises wanted and the jobs the 
workers looked for were all realized through market competition. 
This is the basic characteristic of employment in a market for 
the work force. 
  In the market for the work force, the flow of workers is not 
conditioned by ownership. Instead, it is guided by wages 
(influenced by the price of laborers). Beginning from 1992, a 
"reverse flow" of laborers appeared for the first time in 
Wenzhou since the founding of the PRC. In two years, more than 
3,000 workers from state and collective enterprises resigned and 
found jobs in township, individual, and private enterprises. 
One of the reasons is that they were "better paid there." 
  Some people were not willing to go to individual and private 
enterprises because "these enterprises merely took care of the 
young but not the old." Retirement pensions were an essential 
condition related to social insurance for developing a market 
for the work force. In view of this, Wenzhou implemented an 
integrated social insurance system commencing in 1991. Laborers 
employed in Wenzhou, whether they belonged to state, collective, 
neighborhood, township, private, individual, or foreign-funded 
enterprises or were self-employed workers, all joined the social 
insurance and employment insurance plan. By paying the same 
amount of premium, they enjoyed the same retirement pension. 
Because of this, some 200,000 salesmen from Wenzhou went to 
other parts of the country while around 400,000 people came to 
Wenzhou to look for jobs. 
  The development of a market for the work force will 
exert a great influence on labor reform and economic structural 
reform as a whole. It will also have an impact on people's 
sense of employment and value. 
  The formulation of a market for the work force will exert a 
significant and far-reaching influence on China's labor reform. 
  The conference of heads of the labor departments and 
bureaus, 
a high level meeting on the country's labor work, held in 
December 1993, proposed for the first time that reform of the 
labor system as a whole should focus on nurturing and developing 
a market for the work force. In the reform of the labor system 
in the past, the development of a labor market constituted only 
part of the work. 
  China's largest special economic zone, Hainan, enjoys a high 
degree of freedom in employment, and was once a "popular place" 
for employment. The Hainan Provincial Government promulgated a 
document in 1992, which clearly stipulated: Competent 
government departments will no longer assign quotas of cadre 
employment, staff recruitment, technical title assessment, and 
wages and promotion. These problems will be resolved by the 
employer and the employee at the labor exchange. To develop a 
market for the work force, an official of the Labor Ministry 
said, competent government departments must change their 
functions and reform their organs and working methods. Hainan 
has taken a lead in this regard. 
  The development of a market for the work force is required 
for deepening enterprise reform. In turn, it also promotes 
deepened reform and a change in enterprise operation mechanisms. 
To let enterprises enter the market, it is necessary for them 
to independently recruit staff and implement a unified social 
insurance system. To practice a new employment mechanism, it is 
also necessary for enterprises to accelerate reform of the labor 
system, such as implementing the all-personnel labor contract 
system, optimizing labor combinations, removing the demarcation 
line that separates cadres from workers, introducing 
distribution reform, and letting society absorb redundant 
personnel. 
  To develop a market for the work force, an increasing 
number of people will have to get their jobs through competition 
and very few will be able to find jobs through mandatory orders. 
Naturally the mentality of urban people having a secure job and 
the sense of instinctive superiority of state enterprises should 
change gradually. In employment, the principle of distribution 
has been replaced by the principle of competition and the 
phenomenon of "sharing secure jobs" has been changed to "vying 
for a secure job." People's sense of employment and value will 
change along with the development of a market for the work 
force, and the earlier they adapt themselves to the new 
employment mechanism, the earlier they can gain the initiative. 
  An economist said: A foreign businessman asked him about 
Chinese officials, who are called servants while the workers, 
masters. But the officials sit in cars while the workers drive. 
How come the master drives for the servant? The economist 
replied: The status of master refers to the working class as a 
whole, not a specific individual. This story tells us that 
foreign people do not understand China's national conditions. 
However, it reminds us that the problems which crop up in 
reform should be resolved by more work and fewer disputes rather 
than arguing first about the truth. The formulation of a market 
for the work force will exert influence on concepts at the 
deeper layer. We need the spirit of doing more work. 
  A market for the work force is complicated system 
engineering. The Labor Ministry predicts that the embryonic form 
of a modern market for the work force will need seven years to 
take shape. 
  The development of a market for the work force can 
breakthrough the demarcation line between urban and rural areas 
and allow free flow of laborers. It is a piece of good news for 
surplus laborers in rural areas because they can enter the 
cities. Nevertheless, such a situation will not likely appear 
within the near future. This is because the the work force 
market has just started and it is still at the initial stage. 
Moreover, it is impossible for China's urban areas to absorb 
large numbers of surplus rural laborers at present. Hence, it 
is a relatively long-term objective. 
  Development of a the work force market is complicated system 
engineering which includes the whole course of laborers seeking 
jobs, introduction, signing contracts, employment, terminating 
contracts, reemployment, and retirement. The establishment of a 
new employment mechanism of free selection of staff and 
employers involves reform of government functions, and social 
insurance, distribution, personnel, and household registration 
systems. However, the deepening and completion of these reforms 
cannot be done overnight. 
  There are difficulties at least in the following five 
respects for the development of the market for the work force at 
present: While selecting a job, laborers are still restricted by 
status and ownership, state enterprises still cannot 
independently employ workers, the main redundant personnel are 
not brought into line with social settlement, and a certain 
number of personnel are placed by the state; in income 
distribution and wages, total payroll of a considerable number 
of state enterprises is still under administrative control and a 
new enterprise wage increase mechanism has not yet taken shape; 
in social insurance, there is a lack of a unified management 
system and the coverage and its extent of socialization are 
limited, which cannot meet the needs of enterprises entering the 
market and flow of the work force; market regulations are still 
imperfect and there is a lack of means for maintaining market 
order; and in macroeconomic control and regulation, methods of 
control and regulation that can meet the needs of a market for 
the work force have not yet taken shape. 
  The extent of the comprehensive and corresponding reforms 
determine the development of a market for the work force. Labor 
Minister Li Boyong had the following views on the prospects for 
a market for the work force: We will use seven years, that is, 
by the end of the century, to coordinate the reforms of various 
fields, further push them in depth, and basically establish an 
embryonic form of a modern work force market. By then, a new 
employment mechanism will spread from a small number of 
localities to the whole country.

Zhengzhong (6079 2973 0022): "Only Reform Can Lighten the Burden 
on State-owned Enterprises--Prospects for Economic Restructuring 
in 1994"] 
  [Text] The hundreds of thousands of state-owned 
enterprises, which are reputedly "the backbone of the republic," 
are facing stern challenges as reform has now entered a new 
historical period. How to unload the heavy historical burdens 
from their backs and compete with enterprises in other economic 
sectors by proceeding from the same starting line, thus creating 
greater wealth in the rivalry in the market economy, is a 
pressing question that they must solve as soon as possible. 
  Beyond question, the state-owned enterprises should be 
credited with their contributions to China's prosperity today 
and the current solid material foundation for reform and 
opening. However, with the continuing in-depth development of 
the economic structural reform and the establishment of the 
socialist market economy, the state- owned enterprises have been 
facing more and more difficulties in their operations and the 
key problem is the slow growth of their economic results. 
  Between 1980 and 1992, the taxable profits made by the 
state-owned industrial enterprises increased by only 110 
percent, which was markedly lower than the 314-percent growth 
rate marked by collective enterprises and the growth rate of 
enterprises in other categories, whose taxable profits 
multiplied 33.5 times. Some state-owned enterprises even found 
it hard to make further development and a large number of 
state-owned enterprises in some trades incurred business losses 
to a serious degree. Of course, the difficult conditions in 
which the state-owned enterprises are now bogged down were 
caused by the problems of the long-standing monolithic planned 
economy. It is still undeniable that the heavy historical 
burden borne by the state-owned enterprises is also a major 
reason why it is so hard for the huge dragon to soar vigorously. 
  How do we unload the burden? The only option is reform and 
problems should be solved by both the state and the enterprises 
themselves. According to expert analysis, the historical burden 
carried by the state-owned enterprises includes four major 
parts, namely: The debt burden; insufficient accumulation for 
paying retirement pensions to old workers; transfers of 
redundant personnel, their unemployment and reemployment; and 
the social welfare undertakings run by the enterprises. 
  It is necessary to relieve the state-owned enterprises of 
their historical burdens and create necessary conditions for the 
innovation of their management system. This top-priority issue 
is to rationalize and adjust the asset-liability structure of 
the enterprises and thus relieve them of their debt burdens in 
order to enable them to join the fair competition in the market. 
The current measure for achieving this purpose is to change the 
loans offered to the enterprises in place of government 
appropriations into state investments according to certain 
limits and proportions, thus increasing the state assets in the 
enterprises. Debts in other forms may also be changed into 
stock rights in different ways. Efforts should be made to seek 
some new ways to raise and distribute funds for worker's 
retirement pensions and other labor insurance compensations 
through some insurance institutions in society, thus solving the 
state-owned enterprises' difficulties in paying pensions to 
retired workers. In the course of auctioning and merging 
enterprises and transforming the enterprise property rights 
system, a certain proportion of assets in the state-owned 
enterprises can be used to keep a social security fund. This 
method can be used on a trial basis. Thus, the burden on the 
back of the enterprise can be unloaded and workers can be freed 
from concern over their livelihood after retirement. 
  Overstaffing is another problem caused by the long-standing 
planned economic structure in the state-owned enterprises. If 
this problem is not solved, fair competition on an equal footing 
among enterprises of all types will become empty talk. In order 
to resolve this problem, the department concerned has decided 
that the redundant personnel arising in the course of enterprise 
reforms should mainly be transferred to the tertiary industry. 
The government will give certain favorable treatment in the 
fields of taxation, credit, and real estate. At the same time, 
some people will be encouraged to seek new jobs in township and 
town enterprises, foreign-funded enterprises, and private 
enterprises; or will be encouraged to seek new jobs by 
themselves. In order to change the situation in which 
state-owned enterprises have to run social welfare undertakings, 
the state has explicitly decided that nonproductive undertakings 
will be gradually separated from the enterprises. Over a long 
period of time, the enterprises have had to run schools for 
their workers' children and various service undertakings and 
perform various social welfare functions. Such undertakings 
should be made independent from the enterprises as soon as 
possible. Some of them should be taken over by the local 
governments; some can be run by community organizations; and 
others can be run by new service enterprises. 
  The huge dragon will eventually soar high. In the coming 
year, through the reform of their organizational and management 
structures, they will certainly be able to stand various stern 
tests in the competition in the market economy.

2621 2556 1511: "Explore a New Path For Industrial Management -- 
A Visit to the China Light Industry Council"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 3 Feb (XINHUA) -- In response to the call 
to readjust organs under the State Council and to explore a new 
way to do a good job in industrial management under the market 
economy, the former Light Industry Ministry took the lead in 
transforming itself into an industrial association and in 
changing its name to the China Light Industry Council. In order 
to learn about the work of the new organization which began 
operation under its new name last June, we recently talked with 
relevant personnel at the Light Industry Council Building. 
  Being chiefly involved in the production of consumer goods 
for daily use, light industry is closely related to the masses' 
daily life and its production performance has a bearing on the 
prosperity of our country's markets, and on economic and social 
stability. In the past, due to the planned economy and its 
difficulty in forecasting future market changes and of 
guaranteeing an effective market supply, there was the recurrent 
phenomena of commodity shortages or stockpiling. Since China's 
implementation of the policy of reform and opening up, light 
industry has achieved quicker development than other industries, 
thanks to its early embracement of the principle of a market 
economy. Since its inception, the Light Industry Council has 
been faced with the problems of how to do a good job managing 
the industry and its changing functions. The council's Chairman 
Yu Zhen, who assumed the post six months ago, briefed us on 
reform of the industry. He said the key to bringing about a 
change from past planned management to the present industrial 
management lies in changing functions. The council was required 
to accomplish a quick change in its operations: A switch from 
the past practice of taking complete charge of the production 
and operation of enterprises to the present one of providing 
them with good services. 
  Yu Zhen said that from now on the Light Industry Council, 
while preserving certain administrative and management 
functions, will devote more energy to employing industrial 
management means well, and indirectly guide enterprises to 
engage in production and business activities; in short, the 
council will try to play its role mainly in giving enterprise 
advise on decisionmaking. To achieve that end, the council 
called on its personnel to change their workstyle and to show 
that their role is to provide enterprises with services. As an 
industry council, it should give priority to doing a good job in 
industrial and regional planning, and industrial policy 
formulation. It has been learned that a number of documents on 
light industry's goals during the "Ninth Five-Year Plan"; 
documents concerning opinions on the basic thinking of the 
long-term plan until the year 2010; and on further promoting the 
industry's opening to the outside world, were formally 
introduced at the recently-held light industry national work 
conference. At the same time, an industrial policy -- with the 
main contents of maintaining a high growth speed, readjusting 
product mix, and adopting the strategy of developing 
famous-brand products -- has also been publicized within the 
entire industry. Light industry is also stepping up work on 
devising measures to meet the challenges which will be faced 
after China resumes its position in the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade. A report on formulation of those measures 
will be disclosed in the next six months. In addition to doing 
a good macroregulation and control job, the Light Industry 
Council has also stepped up providing microlevel guidance to 
enterprises. On the heels of the experimental publication of a 
guide book on the restructuring and transformation of light 
industry as well as on market information, the council recently 
publicized the 1994 market trends for light industry through the 
public media, and presented an analysis of the market prospects 
for several categories of major light industrial products. The 
council's purpose was to provide enterprises with specific 
references for their decisionmaking. 
  Hu Dongguang, responsible person of the production and trade 
department under the Light Industry Council, told us that except 
for the maintenance of a small number of products such as 
newsprint and edible salt on the lists of products under the 
mandatory plan, it has included other products on the guidance 
plan lists. He told us the phenomena of people at the former 
Light Industry Ministry's busying themselves with the allocation 
of funds and materials, and assigning planned quotas will not be 
found at the Light Industry Council. The main areas of the 
council's planning work include: Suggesting which line of 
business requires restrictions and should not be expanded; to 
point out the gaps that exist between domestic and foreign 
business counterparts; and ways to transform and restructure the 
industry. A lot of work needs to be done following the 
council's establishment. For instance, there is the problem of 
solving pollution in the paper-making industry, of redesigning 
refrigerator compressors, and of changes in supply and demand on 
the sugar market. All these require the council to work out 
countermeasures. 
  Another aspect of improved industrial management lies in 
the development of information services. The reporters visited 
the expanded Chinese Light Industry Information Center and saw a 
scene of bustling activity. Wang Qingren, an official of the 
center, told us it provides information services to the 
leadership as well as enterprises. He said: The center is 
developing statistical and commercial information networks for 
light industry; it is also building data banks regarding 
imported equipment, large and medium-sized enterprises, and 
light industrial products. Its services are available to 
enterprises without any restrictions. In addition to the dozens 
of light industry trade magazines, the council will step up 
construction of an information medium by investing huge sums in 
computers and other advanced means of communication to increase 
the center's capacity to collect, store, and analyze information. 
  A source who worked in the Light Industry Ministry for many 
years observed that changes at the Light Industry Council are 
stunning, when you compare what it is doing now to what it was 
doing before the policy of reform and opening up was introduced. 
At that time, all light industrial products, which involved 
huge volumes of a wide range of miscellaneous items, were 
manufactured according to plans. A minor oversight here or there 
was inevitable. For example, pots were once in short supply. 
Nowadays, enterprises organize their production according to 
market demand and markets are well stocked.

<F P=106> [By Pei Jianfeng: "Rolled Steel Needs Hit 100m Tons"] </F>
  [Text] Total demand for rolled steel is expected to reach 
98 to 100 million tons this year, predicted a senior official 
with the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry. 
  The Ministry plans to produce 81 million tons of rolled 
steel 
this year to help meet the rising demand. Another 9 million 
tons will be supplied by stockpiles. 
  The remaining shortage, about 10 million tons, will be met 
by 
imports, said vice-minister Wu Xichun. 
  The import figure is down considerably from last year's 
level, 30.26 million tons, according to latest statistics from 
the General Administration of Customs. 
  In December alone, 4.46 million tons of rolled steel were 
imported. 
  "This is abnormal because at the time the steel price was 
plummeting, the stockpile was growing sharply," Wu said. 
  In recent years, the annual consumption of rolled steel 
increased sharply. 
  Total usage of rolled steel in 1991 was 10 million tons more 
than in 1990, rising by 15 million tons in 1992. 
  Last year, it hit an estimated 93 million tons, an increase 
of 17 million tons over the previous year, Wu said. 
  Domestic iron and steel makers produced 75 million tons of 
rolled steel last year and exported about 2 million tons. 
  Because of the 30.26 million tons of imports, stockpiles 
climbed by about 10 million tons, a record high, and pulled down 
prices, Wu said. 
  He attributed the sharp increase of rolled steel consumption 
to the rapid growth of investment in fixed assets in recent 
years. 
  In 1993 total investment in fixed assets amounted to 1.15 
trillion yuan ($132 billion), up 46 per cent over the previous 
year. 
  This year the government intends to strengthen macro-control 
of the economy and curb fixed assets investment. 
  If the target is achieved, the rapid growth of rolled steel 
usage in the country will be slowed down this year, experts said. 
  And the prices, which experienced dramatic ups and downs 
last 
year, will be steady, they predicted.

  [Text] Beijing, February 4 (XINHUA) -- The Ministry of 
Labor and the Ministry of Coal Industry today jointly called on 
the managerial departments and enterprises of the coal industry 
to take effective measures to avert accidents incurring heavy 
losses. 
  Since January this year, six costly accidents have taken 
place in coal mines, much heavier than in the same period last 
year in terms of frequency and casualties. Each accident caused 
more than 10 deaths. 
  In the latter half of January, four gas and coal-dust 
explosions took place in Hebei, Heilongjiang, Hunan and Guizhou 
Provinces. 
  Wang Senhao, minister of coal industry, attributed the 
frequent accidents to the chaos in management and inadequate 
equipment in coal mines as well as the poor quality of the 
employees. 
  "The root cause for this is that some officials put profits 
before security," he said. 
  He called on all coal mine operations to launch an 
inspection 
movement in February and March to avert gas and coal-dust 
explosions. 
  Township coal mines and those small mines split from the 
major state-owned coal mines, the major accident-makers, should 
be rectified, he said. 
  Li Boyong, minister of labor, also told XINHUA that 84 major 
accidents causing ten or more deaths at one time took place in 
China last year, an increase of 5 percent over the previous year. 
  He said the situation this year allowed no optimism, adding 
that no efforts should be spared to ensure safety in production.

  [Text] Beijing, February 4 (XINHUA) -- A senior Chinese 
official today urged the country's trade departments to take 
effective measures to ensure sufficient means of production for 
farmers for the spring ploughing. 
  China's 900 million farmers will face a "severe overall 
shortage" of fertilizers and other means of production this 
spring, said State Councillor Chen Junsheng at a national 
conference on the supply of means of agricultural production. 
  The main suppliers of the country's means of production, the 
domestic trade departments, have bought much less than for last 
year and have less in stock, Chen said. 
  The number of the country's fertilizer plants has shrunk, 
and 
high-quality fertilizer is more urgently needed, he said, noting 
that imported fertilizers have not come as expected. 
  Chen said that domestic trade bodies must resort to all 
possible means to provide enough for the farmers for the spring 
ploughing. 
  He said that good market order should be maintained. Any 
profiteer who infringes upon the interests of farmers will be 
prosecuted to the full extent of the law. 
  Fake and shoddy goods must be barred from the market, so 
that 
high quality means of production can be ensured for farmers, he 
said. 
  He also encouraged the domestic trade departments to reduce 
circulation costs and offer reasonable prices that farmers can 
afford.

<F P=106> [By XINHUA reporter Ou Zhengtao (0260 2973 3447)] </F>
  [Text] Hefei, 31 Jan (XINHUA) -- Anhui has made significant 
progress in deepening reform. Consequently, the leading 
indicators of social and economic development for this inland 
province have reached record levels: The province's total 
annual output value of goods and services amounted to 94 billion 
yuan in 1993, an increase of more than 19 billion yuan over the 
previous year, and equivalent to the total increase of any given 
four years during the eighties. The output of major agricultural 
products reached an all-time high, with the output value 
increasing 8 percent over the previous year. The province 
achieved 132.8 billion yuan in total industrial output value, up 
37 percent over the previous year. Financial revenue exceeded 
7.3 billion yuan, up 1.8 billion yuan from the preceding year. 
Village and town enterprises, infrastructure construction, and 
foreign trade all reached record levels, registering the highest 
increases in the nation. 
  It is reported that Anhui has reached new levels in three 
areas of reform: 
  -- Changing concepts and opening up in all directions. Anhui 
recovered rapidly following the massive [flood] disaster in 
1992. Mindful of the fact that coastal areas were developing 
rapidly and inland areas were catching up, the Anhui provincial 
committee and government made the correct policy decision to 
raise its economy to a new level through internal and external 
cooperation, beginning with changing concepts and opening up in 
all directions. The implementation of the policy of opening up 
to the outside world based on "two points and one line" -- in 
Hefei and Huangshan and along the Chang Jiang -- quickly turned 
the hinterland into the forefront of opening up to the outside 
world, thereby promoting the opening up of the entire province. 
Meanwhile, unremitting efforts were made to cultivate a new 
type of cadre. The relevant departments selected and educated 
cadres based on their creativity and awareness of market forces 
and overall interests, and they organized efforts to ensure 
substantial headway in reform and opening up. Last year, Anhui 
reversed the previously unstoppable flow of trained personnel 
and funds to coastal areas, as developed coastal areas scrambled 
to invest and find cooperation opportunities in Anhui. All this 
injected strong vitality into Anhui's rapid development. 
  -- Seizing opportunities to make reform the largest growth 
factor. By deepening reform, Anhui tapped its potential, 
inspired enthusiasm, and solved problems arising from the need 
for high input in development. In 1993, Anhui scaled new 
heights in rural reform as it took advantage of changes in the 
rural labor force, as well as urban construction in the 
countryside, to introduce a series of measures to reform the 
rural ownership structure, the industrial structure, the 
development of markets in factors of production, and household 
registration administration. This effectively promoted high 
quality and high efficiency in agricultural production, as well 
as the industrialization and urbanization of the rural economy. 
More than 3,000 small towns of a substantial size were initially 
built across the provinces, and a market system was born. More 
than 5 million peasants switched to secondary and tertiary 
industries. The output value of village and town enterprises 
totaled 110 billion yuan, increasing by nearly 100 percent in a 
year. The per capita income of peasants across the province 
increased by more than 100 yuan. 
  -- Improving overall competitiveness through comprehensive 
reform and solving new development-related problems through 
reform means. Anhui accelerated supplementary reforms aimed at 
changing governmental functions, establishing a social security 
system, cultivating markets, and developing individual and 
private enterprises. This ensured breakthroughs in economic 
reform and improvements in overall strength, resulting in a 
three-way development pattern. Specifically in market 
construction, more than 4,000 good-sized markets were built 
across the province. With the approval of the province and the 
state, more than 50 specialized markets concerning factors of 
production were established, and there were a dozen or so 
country markets whose annual business volume exceeded 100 
million yuan.

  [Text] Village and town industries in our province again 
made substantial headway in 1993, generating more than 400 
billion yuan in total output value and marketing more than 90 
percent of their products. They held leading positions among 
prefectures and cities nationwide. According to special staff 
correspondent (Yuan Yahe), the total output value of village and 
town industries in Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and Zhenjiang Cities 
surpassed 3 billion yuan in 1993, representing (?53) percent of 
that of similar industries in the province. Wuxi County, 
Jiangyin City, Wujin City, Zhangjiagang City, and Changshu City, 
known as the five tigers in the southeast, all achieved more 
than 20 billion yuan in output value; this worked out to more 
than 150 billion yuan in total output value, which was the 
highest in southeast Jiangsu. 
  In 1993, our province formally began to implement the 
shareholding and stock cooperative systems in village and town 
enterprises. By the end of November, there were more than 2,600 
experimental enterprises across the province, with shares 
totaling 4.7 billion yuan. Eight new enterprise groups were 
formed, with 5 billion yuan in total fixed assets, or 10 percent 
of the total assets of village and town enterprises across the 
province. Last year saw the fastest economic development for 
our province's village and town enterprises, which achieved more 
than (?55 billion yuan) in sales of export goods, or 
approximately 30 percent of total sales by village and town 
enterprises across the country. More than 4,200 new wholly or 
partly foreign-owned enterprises were set up, bringing the total 
number of such enterprises to 10,000. On average, one out of 
every 10 village and town enterprises in the province was a 
joint venture, and the total amount of contracted foreign 
capital equaled $4 billion.

three to five years. The third is concentrating efforts on 
reform, opening up, introducting foreign capital, and expanding 
exports. 
  He hoped that central press unit reporters stationed in

  [Excerpts] The provincial people's government this morning 
invited the provincial industry and communications department 
director, as well as all prefectural and city industry and 
communications bureaus chiefs from across the province, to a 
work meeting to analyze the industrial situation in January 1994 
and to arrange for industrial and communications production in 
February 1994. Provincial Vice Governor Zhang Yunchuan presided 
over and delivered a speech at the meeting. 
  The meeting revealed that the province's total industrial 
output value realized at and above the township level in January 
1994 reached 5.3 billion yuan, up by 48.5 percent over the same 
period last year, thereby overfulfilling the planned quota by 
300 million yuan. [passage omitted] 
  The meeting called on industry and communications 
departments 
at all levels across the province to maintain sustained and 
fast-paced industrial growth in February 1994 by generating a 
total of 4.7 billion yuan of industrial output value, up by 13 
percent over the corresponding period last year; raising daily 
industrial output value to 188 million yuan, up by 10 percent 
over January 1994; raising production-marketing ratio to and 
above 95 percent; and reducing overall losses by 10 percent. To 
this end, it is imperative to concentrate on the following work 
aspects: 
  1. To vigorously increase the production and marketing of 
products and to maintain sustained and fast-paced industrial 
growth; 
  2. To step up technological transformation and scale new 
heights of production; 
  3. To strengthen and improve enterprise management by 
strengthening overall quality control and increasing economic 
efficiency; 
  4. To guarantee electric power supplies during the Lunar New 
Year festival and to avert major mechanical problems; 
  5. To guarantee smooth railroad transportation during the 
Lunar New Year festival period, especially transportation of 
passengers, coal, petroleum, iron, and steel, as well as of 
essential goods and materials. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party 
committee, conducted investigations and study activities in 
Jinan city recently. 
  After the investigations, he urged: We should concentrate 
energy, strengthen measures, have extremely great determination 
and daring, solidly and effectively do our work, and achieve the 
reform work of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. 
We should quicken the setup of the modern enterprise system and 
enliven large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. 
  During his investigation and study activities in Jinan city, 
Jiang Chunyun, respectively, held forums with six enterprises 
with better economic results and four enterprises with bigger 
difficulties; and also inspected, on the spot, the Jinan [words 
indistinct] Corporation, the Jinan No. 2 Printing and Dyeing 
Mill, and the Jinan Beer Shareholding Group Company. 
  At the [words indistinct] corporation, Jiang Chunyun 
affirmed 
the practice of using foreign capital to conduct technological 
transformation and building it into a new-typed new high-tech 
enterprise. He said that using foreign capital to conduct 
technological transformation is a shortcut to quicken 
enterprises' technological progress. 
  At the Jinan No. 2 printing and dyeing mill that suffers 
deficits, Jiang Chunyun inspected, on the spot, the Shandong 
handicraft market which was set up after the mill had readjusted 
its structures. He praised this mill for transferring two 
thirds of its staff members and workers to the tertiary industry 
and also affirmed the second pioneering work done by the mill 
with 100 years of history. 
  Jiang Chunyun said: Doing the second pioneering work is a 
revolution of vital importance to all money-losing enterprises. 
Facing the strained circumstances, we can neither fear 
difficulties nor adopt a wait-and-see attitude. We should 
pioneer ways by ourselves and tide over the feeling of fearing 
difficulties. Instead of waiting for and relying on others' 
assistance, we should press forward in the face of difficulties 
and rely on reform to seek existence, make development, and 
blaze new trails. 
  On 7 February, Jiang Chunyun visited the Jinan beer 
shareholding group company. After hearing the report on the 
situation of enterprises in Jinan city and the speeches on 
enlivening large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises made 
by the provincial and city departments concerned, Jiang Chunyun 
pointed out: Enlivening large and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises is the key point and the difficult point of reform. 
Whether or not the large and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises are full of vitality is a matter relating to the 
success of reform. Our next-step tasks are to accelerate the 
setup of the modern enterprise system, to positively explore new 
ways, to proceed from the reality of large and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises to solve a series of key fundamental 
problems, and to make these enterprises be full of vitality. 
  To this end, Jiang Chunyun set forth that first of all, we 
should achieve the internal reform of large and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises. 
  Jiang Chunyun said: Reforming the property system is a 
prerequisite condition for setting up the modern enterprise 
system as well as the key point to promote the overall 
enterprise reform. Therefore, to promote the reform of the 
property system, we should vigorously encourage the 
implementation of the shareholding system, positively develop 
limited liability companies, and encourage the development of 
the state-owned and civilian-run small accounting units. The 
enterprises that are hopeless to halt deficits can be auctioned 
off and their ownership can be transferred. 
  Jiang Chunyun stressed: In the course of enlivening large 
and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, the governments at 
various levels and the mass departments should streamline the 
administration and delegate power to lower levels, resolutely 
and thoroughly delegate to lower levels the rights that should 
be delegated, and actually realize the turn from direct to 
indirect control. We should carry out policies to help 
enterprises eliminate the debts payable and to solve the 
problems that enterprises bear financial burden in supporting 
social undertakings. It is necessary to provide socialized 
service; to set up and perfect markets for production factors, 
intermediate service organizations, and social insurance 
systems; and to actually create fine external conditions for 
reforming and developing large and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises.

<F P=106> [Article by Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju from the "Monthly </F>
Commentary" column: "Journalism Must Be in Touch With the Pulse 
of the Times"] 
  [Text] China's reform, opening up, and modernization 
endeavors entered a new stage of development after Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping gave his important talk in southern China in early 1992 
and after the holding of the 14th national party congress. With 
the publication of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping in November last year -- a book imbued with the 
distinctive spirit of the times and glittering with shining 
Marxist truth -- and the "Decision on Certain Issues Concerning 
the Establishment of a Socialist Economic System" made by the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, China's 
socialist construction during the new period began to have a 
powerful ideological weapon and a great program for action. 
Seizing the opportunity to accelerate reform, opening up, and 
development as well as finish building a socialist market 
economic system by the end of this century is both a great 
historical mission for people throughout the country and a 
distinctive feature of the new period. 
  Journalism is the voice of the party and the people, and the 
vanguard of the times. At a time when China's socialist 
construction is undergoing historic and profound changes and the 
Chinese are confidently heading toward a new century, journalism 
must be in close touch with the pulse of the times, 
energetically promote the spirit of the times, fully reflect the 
development of the times, clear the way for reform and opening 
up, serve the socialist market economy, and praise the great 
achievements of the socialist modernization drive. 
  To be in touch with the pulse of the times, journalists must 
persist in emancipating their minds and seek truth from facts. 
The drive for socialist modernization and developing a 
socialist market economy is an unprecedented great cause, and we 
cannot possibly succeed in this cause and build a new world 
unless we dare to probe and explore. To keep pace with this 
situation, journalists must emancipate their minds even further, 
change their mindsets, break with outmoded ways of thinking, 
explore ideas, broaden the vision, and come up with new ideas. 
Anything conducive to developing socialist productive forces, 
to increasing our socialist country's overall strength, and to 
improving the people's living standards should be publicized in 
a big way and reported promptly. Under the premise that 
journalism must uphold the party's basic line, display party 
spirit, and safeguard stable social development, the intensity 
of journalistic reform must be greater. Through reform, there 
should be more subject matters to report, news reporting must be 
more flexible and diverse, and the capacity for information must 
be greater so that journalism can truly guide ideological 
emancipation and truly become the propagator of the main theme 
of the times. To seek truth from facts, journalists must report 
fully and truthfully, and must uphold dialectics and the theory 
of one divides into two. While they should depict beautiful 
prospects in order to boost people's morale, they should also 
describe the formidability of reform and opening up as well as 
the problems of speeding up reform. While they must make great 
efforts to publicize the significance of building a socialist 
market economy, they must also remind the people that the market 
needs the government's scientific and rational regulation and 
control. Journalism will play a more significant role during 
the new period when journalists report comprehensively and 
truthfully. 
  To be in touch with the pulse of the times, journalists must 
go deep into the realities of life to understand the new 
situation, study new issues, and report new things. The great 
cause of reform and opening up is an inexhaustible source for 
journalism, and it is journalists' noble responsibility to 
capture social hot points; study the new issues appearing during 
economic development, reform, and opening up; and promptly 
report the masses' great accomplishments. This being the case, 
journalists must be more aware of their historical missions and 
must be determined to work on the front of socialist 
construction to produce honey from the prettiest flowers 
[sentence as published]. Journalists must keep in mind the 
overall interests, make use of the typical cases and first-hand 
material in their hands, be good at speaking with facts, and 
describe things with the language of the masses. In order to go 
deep into the realities of life, journalists must selflessly 
dedicate themselves to their profession, disregard personal gain 
and loss, and defy hardships so their diligence will yield 
fruitful results and their fortitude will turn out brilliant 
reports. 
  To be in touch with the pulse of the times, journalists 
must maintain close ties with the masses and respect their 
initiatives. Building socialism with Chinese characteristics is 
a cause which has to be accomplished together by millions of 
people; the interest of the masses is the basic objective of 
this cause, and the masses are also the source of its strength 
and creativity. Comrade Xiaoping stated that our starting point 
and the objective of all our work should be measured by "whether 
the people embrace and endorse it, whether the people are happy 
with it, and whether the people approve it." During the new 
period characterized by reform and opening up, journalists 
should do an even better job in building a bridge between the 
party and the government on the one hand, and the people on the 
other, so that the vast number of people will be informed of all 
ongoing construction and reform projects; so that the people 
will understand them, take part in them, and support them; and 
so that the party and government can understand the masses' 
aspirations even better and hear their voice more clearly. 
During the new year, when many new reform measures will be 
introduced and new construction projects will be launched, the 
masses need time to understand these measures and projects, and 
the interests of some people will be affected. This requires 
the press to give the masses proper guidance, promptly reflect 
their problems, and do a good job in protecting the masses' 
initiatives and bringing them into play so as to boost their 
morale, arouse their vitality, stabilize social order, and speed 
up modernization as well as the building of a socialist market 
economic system. 
  To be in touch with the pulse of the times, journalism needs 
a contingent of highly proficient and capable journalists. The 
most important requirement now is to organize journalists to 
study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping 
and arm journalists' minds with Comrade Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics so they will be 
able to handle the assignments presented to them by the new 
historical period and the new situation. Meanwhile, during the 
course of developing the socialist market economy, journalists 
must set even higher requirements for themselves and firmly 
resist the inroads of money worship, nihilism, and 
ultraindividualism; must reject compensatory journalism; and 
must seek no personal interests. However, they will be 
qualified journalists who will discharge their lofty 
responsibilities and accomplish their sacred missions.

Zhang Xuelin (1728 7185 2651): "Chai Songyue Emphasizes Three 
Key Tasks at a Provincial Meeting of Industrial, Commercial 
Bureau Directors -- Reforming Institutions, Cultivating Markets, 
and Developing Individual and Private Economic Sectors"] 
  [Text] Reforming the registration system, cultivating and 
developing markets into a main force, and developing the 
individual and private sectors of the economy are three key 
industrial and commercial administrative tasks to be undertaken 
by our province this year. A provincial meeting of directors of 
industrial and commercial bureaus concluded yesterday. Chai 
Songyue, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and 
executive vice governor, stated: We should comprehensively 
implement various industrial and commercial administrative 
reforms, and should establish authoritative market-related law 
enforcement and supervision organs. 
  Chai Songyue urged industrial and commercial administrative 
organs to earnestly study and implement the "Company Law" as 
well as help enterprises become independent legal entities which 
are incorporated and disbanded in accordance with the law, and 
which operate independently and assume full responsibility for 
their own profits and losses, in keeping with reforms of the 
modern enterprise system and the enterprise registration and 
management system. 
  Chai Songyue added: Industrial and commercial administrative 
departments at all levels should actively work with relevant 
departments to vigorously cultivate markets, especially those 
for production means and factors, in accordance with the demands 
raised by the provincial party committee and government. We 
should conscientiously perform the glorious duty of overseeing 
and managing the large socialist market. At present, we should 
pay special attention to overseeing and managing grain, cooking 
oil, and vegetable markets, and should investigate and sternly 
deal with the practices of manipulating and cornering markets 
and of driving up prices. We should also stabilize markets and 
work in earnest to ensure supplies to fill "rice sacks" and 
"shopping baskets." 
  Chai Songyue said: We should judge things against the 
criterion of "whether they are conducive to the three causes" 
[conducive to developing the productive forces of our socialist 
society, to increasing the overall strength of our socialist 
country, and to improving the people's living standards]. We 
should correctly understand the status and role of the non-state 
sector. We should not only continue to develop the individual 
and private sectors in areas where the state economic sector is 
underdeveloped, but should also encourage the development of 
such sectors in areas where the state sector has a relatively 
sound basis. We should intensify our education, supervision, 
and management of operators of individually- and privately-run 
enterprises, instructing them to love their party and country, 
respect their professions and abide by the law, work honestly, 
pay taxes according to relevant regulations, operate legally, 
and seek healthy development. 
  Other speakers included Kong Xiangyou, vice chairman of the 
provincial people's congress Standing Committee, and Lu 
Songting, secretary general of the provincial government.

<F P=106> [By Chang Kang (1603 2123): "Shenzhen Leading Body Faces </F>
Purges"] 
  [Text]"Collective Application for Transfer" Was 
Obstructed 
  A series of natural and manmade calamities, including the 
big 
blast at the Qingshuihe warehouse, the serious floods caused by 
the draining of the reservoir, and the conflagration at the 
Kuiyong factory, exposed Shenzhen's protracted hidden crises. 
Some observant and conscientious people are aware of a gradual 
decrease in the number of people coming to Shenzhen from other 
provinces and cities to "see the world" and to "emulate the 
spirit of the special economic zone." Information then 
circulated abroad that a reshuffle, and a major reshuffle at 
that, of Shenzhen's leading bodies was imminent and that some 
people would be held responsible for those accidents.... 
  But the Shenzhen authorities solemnly "refuted the rumor," 
saying one or two media units in Hong Kong "concocted the rumor 
on purpose." 
  The fact, however, is that in early November last year, over 
30 members of the top-level leading bodies of the city party 
committee and government asked to be transferred back to their 
original provinces or original departments. If their requests 
were approved, that would certainly result in a big change. But 
the "collective application for transfer" was turned down by the 
higher authorities. On 5 November, the Guangdong Provincial CPC 
Committee issued to the city party committee and government a 
document which stipulated that cadres serving in the city party 
committee and government at the section level and above shall 
not be transferred for the present stage and that any necessary 
cadre transfer must be discussed by the city party committee and 
be reported to the provincial party committee's organization 
department for examination and for the record. 
  Was there any causality between the request for transfer and 
the order to "stop transferring cadres for the time being?" 
<H5>  Chen Yun and Peng Zhen Were "Furious" and Gave Instructions </H5>
  An informed cadre in Shenzhen leaked word that things were 
getting hard for local leading cadres because the disasters had 
resulted in many "after effects." In their recent, restricted 
finding report, the Central Discipline Inspection Commission and 
the Guangdong Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission gave a 
detailed account of the private property of Shenzhen's cadres at 
the sub-section level and above, which is not commensurate with 
their official income. This attracted the attention of the CPC 
hierarchy and party elders. Chen Yun, Peng Zhen, Jiang Zemin, 
Qiao Shi, and Li Peng thus gave instructions on the matter. 
  The restricted finding report, which was completed on 18 
December 1993, mainly disclosed: The average monthly salary, 
including the subsidy and bonus, of cadres of the city party 
committee and government stands at between 600 and 850 yuan; 86 
percent of cadres at the sub-section level and above have worked 
in Shenzhen for three years or more and own residential units 
measuring 75 square meters and above. These dwellings average 
more than 400,000 yuan at the going market price and most of 
these residential units are the owners' second dwelling places 
or are let out by their family members. Approximately 80 
percent of cadres serving in the city's industrial and 
commercial management offices, tax bureaus, and public security 
organs and their family members have bank deposits, and 40 
percent of cadres and their family members are share holders. 
  The cadres were so "rich" that they made CPC elder Chen Yun 
furious. Chen then made the following comment: "It is hard to 
imagine that party and government cadres would take advantage of 
reform to make money illegally. How could they ignore party 
discipline and state laws?" 
  Peng Zhen, who had been responsible for the party's 
procuratorial and judicial work, directed his instructions 
against "criminal offenses": "Some achievements in reform and 
opening up shall not be used to cover up the corruption and 
criminal offenses committed by some party and government cadres. 
Investigations show many cadres in Shenzhen practice graft, 
take bribes, and levy blackmail on others. We should no longer 
take a laissez-faire attitude toward such soul-stirring 
offenses." 
<H5>  Jiang Zemin, Qiao Shi, and Li Peng Gave Separate Instructions </H5>
  The party's General Secretary Jiang Zemin also gave the 
following instructions: "The leading bodies of the Shenzhen 
City CPC Committee and government are seriously corrupt. This 
problem has not been earnestly dealt with in the last seven to 
eight years, so it has produced a great undesirable impact. The 
party's general secretary, secretaries, and party-member cadres 
are equal before party discipline and national laws. It is high 
time for us to thoroughly settle the problem." 
  Qiao Shi, who is responsible for procuratorial and judicial 
work, said in his instructions: "Those leading party and 
government cadres who commit all kinds of outrages under the 
sign board or by taking advantage of reform and opening up must 
be dealt with according to party discipline and national law. 
No such harmful persons should be allowed to go scot-free. If 
we did not act this way, that would mean we brush aside the 
voice of the masses, generally acknowledged principles, and the 
state laws." 
  State Council Premier Li Peng's instructions read: "It is 
necessary to resolutely and relentlessly crack down on corrupt 
elements within the party by legal means. In the meantime, 
informants should be protected and given necessary awards." 
  The CPC leaders' instructions certainly applied heavy 
pressure on those involved. At the meeting of the provincial 
party committee standing committee held in late December last 
year, Secretary Xie Fei stressed: The grave impact of the 
problem concerning the corruption committed by the leading 
bodies of the Shenzhen City CPC Committee and government has 
gone beyond Shenzhen and national boundaries. The image of 
reform and opening up would be tarnished if the problem were not 
exposed and solved. 
<H5>  Five Opinions Advanced by the CPC Secretariat </H5>
  But before the problem was really "brought out into the 
open," the CPC Central Committee Secretariat had advanced five 
tentative opinions on addressing the problem of the leading 
bodies of the Shenzhen City CPC Committee and government upon 
the beginning of 1994. They are: 
  1. The leading bodies of the city party committee and 
government must, under the specific leadership of the provincial 
party committee, continue to keep effective tabs on the present 
tasks and reorganize themselves. 
  2. The leading bodies of the existing city party committee 
and government and of the two preceding party committees are 
undoubtedly questionable and some members have seriously 
violated the law and discipline. 
  3. The central authorities hope cadres who commit offenses, 
big and small, will consciously report their cases to the 
departments concerned so that they will be treated with leniency. 
  4. The central authorities require that leading party and 
government cadres at all levels in Shenzhen examine and correct 
their mistakes by themselves. Harsh measures must be taken 
against those who commit offenses while examining their past 
offenses, who deliberately flout the law, and those who violate 
the law while enforcing the law. And, 
  5. The central authorities have decided to send work teams 
to cooperate with the provincial party committee in carrying out 
an anticorruption campaign in Shenzhen party and government 
departments. 
  The departments concerned in Guangdong, which could not 
afford to shrug off the opinions, immediately organized cadres 
to dig Shenzhen's "corruption up by the roots." This time the 
leadership really "squared accounts after the autumn harvest," 
laying bare some of the Shenzhen authorities' "family scandals" 
hushed up since 1987. 
<H3>  Guangdong Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission Dug 
the Corruption "Up by the Roots" </H3>
  Following is the fact-finding report sent to the Central 
Discipline Inspection Commission by the Guangdong Provincial 
Discipline Inspection Commission in early January and some 
materials made public by the provincial party committee and 
government. 
  1. Since 1987, 35 to 45 percent of Shenzhen's annual 
expenditures were spent on "social intercourse," "bonuses," and 
"subsidies." The figure was as high as 58 and 56 percent in 
1988 and 1992 respectively. 
  2. From 1987 to October 1993, the provincial party 
committee, the provincial discipline inspection commission, and 
the provincial corruption investigation and crime hunting center 
received 2,500 letters against 470 cadres at subsection level 
and above of the city party committee and government and over 90 
departments, commissions, offices, bureaus, and sections under 
the city party committee and government, from people in 23 
provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities across the 
land. 
  3. The staff of the Shenzhen corruption investigation and 
crime hunting center reported to departments concerned under the 
provincial party committee 230 cases involving violations of the 
law and discipline by Shenzhen's leading party and government 
cadres. 
  4. Initial statistics compiled by Shenzhen's banks and 
credit departments reveals since 1987 Shenzhen's bad debts have 
reached 22 percent of the total debts and 90 percent of the bad 
debts totaling 18.5 billion yuan were underwritten by the 
city-level departments or relevant leading cadres. 
  5. Shenzhen's state enterprises evaded 80 percent of taxes, 
foreign-funded enterprises evaded 75 percent, and individuals 95 
percent. According to an initial estimation, the economic 
losses from tax evasion from 1987 to 1992 hit 36 billion yuan. 
  6. The purpose of an average of 16 percent of the funds for 
Shenzhen's urban capital construction in 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 
1991, and 1992 was unknown and the cost of 39 percent of the 
projects was higher than the estimated figure. 
<H3>  A Former Director of XINHUA Hong Kong Branch Was Involved in 
Shenzhen's Corruption </H3>
  It appears that, under pressure from the central 
authorities, 
Shenzhen will launch an anticorruption campaign soon. It is 
still unknown whether "there is much said but little done" in 
the campaign as there was before, but it is certain that the 
campaign will come to an end hastily because, under the CPC's 
existing system, the "whole body is affected if one hair is 
pulled." According to the information provided by the Central 
Discipline Inspection Commission in early January, various 
ministries and central committees have received a total of 1,300 
letters and telephone calls (including those from Chinese 
residing in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and overseas and from 
foreign businessmen) about corruption and violations of 
discipline and laws in Shenzhen's party and government 
departments involving ministerial-level cadres, NPC vice 
chairmen (or chairman), CPPCC (the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference) vice chairmen (or chairman), and former 
directors (or director) of XINHUA Hong Kong branch.

  [Text] Provincial justice department Director Wu Zhenhan 
yesterday made a speech at a meeting of prefectural, autonomous 
prefectural, and city justice bureau chiefs as well as 
reform-through-labor and reeducation-through-labor unit leaders 
from across the province. 
  In his speech, Wu Zhenhan pointed out: The province's 
justice administration work has scored noticeable results over 
the past year, which are proven by the following facts: With or 
without lawsuits, the province's lawyers have helped their 
clients successfully obtain compensation amounting to more than 
1 billion yuan. Mediatory organs at all levels across the 
province have successfully mediated more than 0.4 million cases 
of civil dispute. The province's total number of suicide cases 
and total number of criminal cases resulting from civil disputes 
have each dropped by 6 percent over the previous year. 
  Provincial party committee Secretary Wang Maolin and Wu 
Xiangdong, provincial party committee standing committee member 
and political and legal affairs committee secretary, delivered 
speeches at yesterday's closing session speeches, calling for 
conscientiously implementing to the letter the principle of 
"reform first, production second" in reform-through-labor and 
reeducation-through-labor work and successfully carrying out 
both reform and production on the premise of instituting the 
people's democratic dictatorship. 
  Comrades Wang Maolin and Wu Xiangdong urged party committees 
and governments at all levels in the province to earnestly 
strengthen leadership over justice administration departments 
and build a competent contingent of justice administration 
officials, police officers, and policemen. They put forth a 
number of specific requirements to this end. 
  A total of eight advanced units and 42 advanced individuals 
recommended by the State Ministry of Justice and the Hunan 
Provincial Justice Department respectively were commended at the 
meeting. 
  Liu Fusheng, provincial people's congress standing committee 
chairman; Zhu Dongyang, provincial people's congress standing 
committee vice chairman; and provincial vice Governor Zhou 
Shichang also attended yesterday's closing session.

  [Text] Addressing the third enlarged meeting of the First 
Hunan Provincial Armed Police Corps CPC Committee yesterday 
morning, provincial party committee Secretary Wang Maolin 
eagerly urged all members of the armed police units in the 
province to study in depth the guideline laid down by the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and Volume 3 
of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, to adhere to 
the guidance of the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics in the operation of the armed police force, and 
to make new contributions to safeguarding social stability and 
promoting the economic development of the province. 
  Provincial party and government leaders (Luo Haifan), Wu 
Xiangdong, Zhu Dongyang, and Zhou Shichang attended the meeting. 
  Secretary Wang Maolin said: Only if they study in depth and 
implement well the guideline laid down by the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, do a good job in 
studying and publicizing Volume 3 of the Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping, and persist in arming the armed police force 
fighters and officers with the theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and in applying this theory to the 
operation and development of the armed police force, will our 
armed police units -- as an armed force defending our cause of 
socialist modernization -- be able to uphold unswervingly the 
principle of absolute party leadership over the Army and thus 
more efficiently undertake the historical mission entrusted by 
the 14th party congress of defending reform and opening up, and 
of safeguarding economic construction. 
  Secretary Wang Maolin asserted in particular that the 
general 
situation in the province is good at present. Last year, the 
province achieved great successes in all aspects, he said. 
However, there are still quite a few unstable factors in the 
community. Therefore, armed police units at all levels are 
expected to firmly bear in mind that their essential duties are 
to perform routine duties and to carry out emergency operations, 
constantly heighten their sense of police duty, step up the 
reform of the official duty system, and improve their efficiency 
in performing duties. The armed police force must carry forward 
the fine tradition of the Army; vigorously support and play an 
active part in the province's reform, opening up, and economic 
construction; and take action to contribute to the development 
and prosperity of Hunan Province.

  [Excerpt] In 1993, the province's total national defense 
science and technology industrial output value registered a 
growth 31.86 percent higher than the province's average 
industrial output value growth, while the total amount of taxes 
and profits realized by the province's national defense science 
and technology industry recorded a 267 percent increase over the 
year before. 
  Yang Zhengwu, provincial party committee deputy secretary, 
at 
a provincial national defense science and technology industry 
conference being held at the moment, delivered a speech in which 
he called on all national defense science and technology 
industrial enterprises to establish more lateral economic 
associations in various forms within the province; take the 
initiative to contract more projects of the province's "huge 
dragon" and "torch" programs; make persistent efforts to do away 
with rigid and conservative ideological concepts; cultivate a 
strong sense of market competition; adapt itself more to Hunan's 
overall economic growth, major trades and professions 
development, and international economic development as well; and 
make unremitting efforts to open up new vistas. [passage

<F P=106> [By Yu Chao-chi (0151 0340 0679): "High-Level Talks Will Be </F>
Held Between the Two Sides of the Strait"] 
  [Excerpt] 
<H3>  There Will Be High-Level Talks Between the Two 
Sides of the Strait </H3>
  "There is likely to be high-level contact between the 
decision-making hierarchies on both sides of the strait later 
this year," a senior official told this reporter in Beijing. 
  "High-level, naturally, means higher than the level of 
either 
Wang-Koo talks or Chiao-Tang talks. Under the current 
situation, playing for time is unfavorable to Taiwan and the 
international environment is also unfavorable to it. In recent 
months, Sino-U.S. relations have taken a turn for the better, 
China and France have normalized their relations, Lesotho has 
restored diplomatic relations with China, and South Africa is 
deliberating the issue of establishing diplomatic relations 
soon. As far as Taiwan is concerned, the closer Hong Kong gets 
to 1997, the greater will be the impact on Taiwan. Furthermore, 
the drastic increase in contacts between the two sides of the 
strait has made it impossible for them not to talk to each 
other. The higher the level of talks, the bigger the issues 
which can be solved and the easier it will be for Taiwan to 
extricate itself from a passive situation." In short, "so long 
as we sit down and hold talks, everything can be discussed." The 
senior official further said: "Since the reorganization of the 
Central Leading Group for Taiwan Affairs, with Jiang Zemin 
taking over from Yang Shangkun as head, Qian Qichen as deputy 
head, and Wang Zhaoguo handling routine work, new people have 
new work styles. Under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping's policy 
decision, China's work toward Taiwan will forge ahead more 
quickly this year." 
<H3>  Before the "Cultural Revolution," Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai 
Contacted Taiwan on the Issue of Reunification Through a Certain 
Channel </H3>
  For many years past, Luo Qingchang was responsible for both 
the central investigation department and the work toward Taiwan, 
the two sensitive departments of the CPC. He disclosed that, 
before the "Cultural Revolution," Mao and Zhou contacted Taiwan 
through a certain channel to discuss the issue of reunification. 
The contact was later suspended as a result of the "Cultural 
Revolution." In 1994, contacts between the two sides of the 
strait have increased in every aspect and the level is also 
higher. Further talks and consultations at a high level have 
become an irresistible trend. 
  Wang Daohan, chairman of the Association for Relations 
Across 
the Taiwan Strait [ARATS], also looks forward to meeting Koo 
Chen-fu again this year to solve differences, consolidate 
achievements, widen the scope of consensus, and to make 
preparations to hold a joint economic fair. He hopes that, in 
marching toward a new century, we should not, due to political 
differences, bungle the good opportunity of bringing benefits to 
the Chinese nation. 
<H5>  "Vacationing Diplomacy" Draws the Attention of the CPC </H5>
  As cross-strait exchanges increase in frequency, the level 
of 
contacts has also higher. Early this year, Zhou Guangzhao, 
president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and a member of the 
CPC Central Committee, and Nan Zhenzhong, deputy president and 
editor in chief of XINHUA News Agency, visited Taiwan in turn 
leading the delegations, and ARATS and the Straits Exchange 
Foundation [SEF] have also started new contacts. Following the 
secret meeting between Chang Chien-pang, member of the 
Kuomintang [KMT] Central Standing Committee, and Jiang Zemin, 
high-level Taiwan personnel are again deliberating on new trips 
to the mainland. 
  In the meantime, however, Taiwan "President" Li Teng-hui, 
"Executive Yuan President" Lien Chan, "Economic Planning and 
Development Council" Chairman Hsiao Wan-chang, "Information 
Bureau" chief Hu Chih-chiang, and others have been, or are 
going, to Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia in the name of 
"spending their vacations" to "coordinate and adjust policies" 
and "pursue pragmatic diplomacy." 
  Taiwan's recent "vacationing diplomacy" and "south-bound 
policy" have drawn the close attention of the CPC. Wang 
Zhaoguo, director of the Central Office for Taiwan Affairs and 
head of the United Front Work Department, has criticized Taiwan 
for attempting to create, under the pretext of solving practical 
affairs, the so- called "independent sovereignty" and "equal 
judicial jurisdiction" to attain the objective of "two equal 
political entities." 
<H3>  Deng Xiaoping Reaffirms That Taiwan Will Not Be Allowed To 
Become Independent </H3>
  Deng Xiaoping said: The problem with Li Teng-hui is that he 
practices "two Chinas." "One China, one Taiwan," "one country, 
two governments," "independent political entity," and even the 
recent "vacationing diplomacy" are all manifestations of overtly 
and covertly practicing "two Chinas," which is, naturally, 
unworkable. 

<H5>    Beijing Works Out Policies in Light of Taiwan's Reality </H5>
  China's basic policies regarding Taiwan work are "one 
China," 
"peaceful reunification," and "one country, two systems." In 
the view of the CPC, there is only one China in the world and 
the central government is in Beijing. This is a precondition 
for a peaceful solution of the Taiwan issue. The "two systems 
coexist" under "one country," with Taiwan and the mainland 
preserving their own original system. They should "coexist for 
a long time and attain common development, with neither 
swallowing the other." Under the present circumstances, however, 
the CPC will never renounce the use of force against Taiwan. 
Especially if foreign forces interfere in Taiwan's internal 
affairs and Taiwan breaks away and becomes independent, it is 
even more necessary to be prepared. Now, if the central 
authorities renounce the use of force, it would hamper 
reunification and the Taiwan independence forces will become 
even more dizzy with success. 
  As the CPC top hierarchy sees it, in light of the latest 
developments in Taiwan, it is necessary to realistically 
understand changes in Taiwan's situation today. The elderly KMT 
party, government, and army leaders, who retreated to Taiwan in 
1949, have withdrawn from the political arena one after another. 
Those in charge in Taiwan today are from the third and fourth 
generations. Many of them are either native Taiwanese or were 
born in Taiwan. They are profoundly affected by Western 
influence in terms of education, culture, and ideology. This 
generation is different from the previous "older-level" figures 
and so the Chinese side should approach them differently. 
Having a thousand and one links with the mainland, the 
"older-level" figures of the KMT have a strong anti- Communist 
feeling. The new generation, however, has fewer ties with the 
mainland and they hold weaker anti-Communist sentiments. Their 
local mentality and their concept of "Taiwan first" are more 
conspicuous but they should not on this count be regarded as 
engaging in "Taiwan independence." 
<H5>  Carry Out Contacts With All Parties and Factions </H5>
  According to the CPC top hierarchy, given the party politics 
in Taiwan, the Democratic Progressive Party [DPP] has a certain 
number of supporters. Under this new situation, in its work 
toward Taiwan, the CPC should not just have dealings with the 
KMT but should have contacts with all parties and factions, 
including the DPP and the New Party and, in the process of 
contact and work among them, try to quicken the pace of China's 
reunification. 
<H3>  Make Preparations for Direct Shipping By Setting Up an 
Economic and Trade Coordination Group </H3>
  Given that China's comprehensive national power and people's 
economic life are continuously improving, the cross-strait 
business has accelerated, and exchange visits have drastically 
increased, the CPC top hierarchy has suggested that the State 
Council should speedily set up a Taiwan Economic and Trade 
Coordination Group to coordinate business affairs with Taiwan 
and create a better investment environment. In light of the 
increasingly close cross- strait business contacts, the central 
authorities have agreed to the setting up of a joint venture 
bank and, in keeping with the latest development in the 
situation, to make all preparations for three communications, 
further boost peace talks through trade, exchange, and contact, 
and strive for the early reunification between the two sides of 
the strait. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report: "Deng Xiaoping Toured Shanghai, and Visited Suzhou </F>
and Wuxi"] 
  [Text] At present, CPC senior leader Deng Xiaoping is 
resting in Shanghai together with his family, and has no 
intention of leaving Shanghai in the near future. Reportedly, 
after he arrived in Shanghai late last year, he occasionally 
went out. In addition to visiting some places in Shanghai, he 
also made a tour to Suzhou and Wuxi. 
  According to reports by some Shanghai newspapers, on 23 
December 1993, Deng Xiaoping inspected Yangpu Bridge in the 
company of Deng Xiaoping [as published]. [Hong Kong TA KUNG PAO 
in Chinese 8 February 94 page two carries a similar report which 
asserts that "on 13 December 1993, accompanied by his beloved 
daughter Mao Mao, Deng Xiaoping inspected the Yangpu Bridge in 
Shanghai."] There, he got out of the car and walked on the 
bridge. He also visited the Bund. On New Year's Day, he came 
to the New Jinjiang Hotel. 
  Reportedly, Shanghai municipal leaders reported Shanghai's 
recent development situation to Deng Xiaoping, who expressed 
satisfaction at Shanghai's developments and changes. 
  Most members of Deng Xiaoping's family are now also in 
Shanghai, accompanying old Deng. His eldest son Deng Pufang 
appeared on a public occasion on 4 February. 
  For the last few years, Deng Xiaoping was used to spending 
the Chinese New Year holiday in Shanghai. It is expected that 
he will also stay in Shanghai in the coming Chinese New Year.

<F P=106> [By Chang Mu (1728 3092): "Deng Xiaoping Calls For </F>
Substantial Development in Pudong and Personally Gives Advice To 
Support Zhu Rongji"] 
  [Text]The CPC authorities designated this year as 
China's "Year of Reform and Development" and "Year of Legal 
System Building." An important sign is that from this year to 
the end of this century, efforts will be made to switch from a 
planned economy to a market economy in all dimensions in terms 
of central decisionmaking, state legislation, government 
administration, enterprise operation, and social life, and that 
this important reform that will change China's look will be 
achieved in seven years' time. A high-level CPC leader claimed 
that the reform in the 1980's was primarily aimed at breaking 
the old structure and "dismantling the old house," while the 
next step is primarily aimed at setting up a new structure and 
building a tall building." 
<H5>  Shanghai's Development Benefits the Whole of China </H5>
  In the past few years, Deng Xiaoping always spent the Spring 
Festival season in Shanghai. This year, as he turns 90, is no 
exception. In January Deng showed his face twice in such places 
as the newly completed Yangpu Bridge. Shanghai is not 
only the birthplace of the CPC, but also a city with the 
greatest economic strength and an influential status in China. 
Moreover, it plays a key role in the effort to build a big port 
city and a financial, economic, and trading metropolis and to 
bring the reform and development nationwide to "a new height." 
Shanghai is where Deng Xiaoping placed his highest hopes when 
setting forth the idea of "creating several Hong Kongs in the 
mainland." The way things are going, it is estimated that by 
the year 2010, Shanghai will probably become one of the 
international economic, financial, and trading centers. 
  The crux is: The opening and development of Shanghai and 
Pudong is a thorough change of the conventional mode of 
operation that has been in use in this base of light and heavy 
industries that plays a leading role in China's economy. After 
that, it will serve as an example and catalyze a positive switch 
of the national economy toward the mechanism of market economy, 
thus affording a strong guarantee for staunchly toeing Deng's 
line. Deng Xiaoping put it point-blank: When Shanghai is 
opened and developed, "The state of reform and opening up in the 
Chang Jiang delta, in the entire Chang Jiang Valley, and even in 
the whole country, will be different." 
<H5>  Concentrate Funds To Help Pudong Take Off First </H5>
  At the beginning of 1990, Deng Xiaoping inspected 
Shanghai and showed appreciation for Zhu Rongji's effort to draw 
up a program for developing Pudong. After returning to Beijing, 
Deng said to leaders of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau: Though I have retired, I would like to mention one 
thing, that you should pay more attention to the development of 
Pudong in Shanghai. Li Peng and Yao Yilin, the number one 
and number two men in the State Council at that time, took 
experts to Shanghai for inspection and feasibility studies on 
separate occasions. After the National People's Congress [NPC] 
session in spring, Li Peng officially announced the CPC 
authorities' decision to develop and open up Shanghai's Pudong, 
thus initiating the strategic process of shifting the focus of 
reform and opening up toward the north. 
  Shanghai used to be a financial and trade center and an 
important port on the west coast of the Pacific Ocean. Starting 
in the 1960's, it gradually dropped behind as a result of the 
political movements. Moreover, with the population explosion, 
the old city area west of Huangpu Jiang was cramped and 
dilapidated. Therefore, focusing on developing and opening up 
Pudong was the only way out for a reinvigorated Shanghai. 
Deng Xiaoping demanded that Pudong should "show progress 
every year and big changes in three years," and "Focus 
investment on those projects that can be started early, because 
the earlier they are started, the earlier we can reap profits, 
otherwise we will drag along into the next century." 
  According to the three principles of giving priority to 
financial and trade projects, giving priority to infrastructure 
projects, and giving priority to high- and new-technology 
industries, 38 new domestic and foreign financial enterprises 
have been set up on the bank of Huangpu Jiang over the past 
three years. The head office of China Everbright Trust and 
Investment Corporation was relocated from Beijing to Pudong. 
Now, the volume of bank deposits in Pudong has reached 25 
billion yuan and total credit 24 billion yuan, representing a 
12-fold increase in a space of three years. A total of 15 
billion yuan was invested in 10 major projects of the Pudong New 
Zone. Among them, the Nanpu Bridge, Yangpu Bridge, the Pudong 
section of the inner beltway of Yang-Gao road, Waigaoqiao Port 
District, Pudong Gas Plant, and the Heliu sewage treatment 
project have been completed, and the Waigaoqiao power plant and 
Lingqiao water works will soon be completed. 
  At present, efforts are being stepped up in the planning 
and design for such projects as the Pudong International 
Airport, outer beltway, Pudong underground railway, second 
cross-river tunnel, and key communication projects. The first 
phase of Binjiang Boulevard, the new bund in Pudong, has an 
original design that outshines the old bund west of the river. 
The planning and design of the central part of Lujiazui 
Financial and Trade District, made to the world's top standards, 
has been completed. Over 50 financial, commercial, and trade 
buildings are under construction and preparations are being made 
for the construction of another 50 buildings or so. The number 
of newly established industrial and trade enterprises is over 
25,000. The golden bund district embracing both sides of 
Huangpu Jiang will become China's CBD (Central Business 
District). Three years ago Pudong had only 37 wholly and 
partially foreign-funded enterprises. The number has now risen 
to more than 1,700, with a total investment of over $5 billion, 
of which $3 billion is foreign investment. Over 2,500 
enterprises are recipients of investment, totaling more than 14 
billion yuan, made by various provinces, municipalities, and 
state ministries and commissions. A batch of famous 
multinational companies have transplanted some advanced 
technologies from around the world to Pudong, including the 
sophisticated chemical industry of America's E. I. DuPont 
Company, automatic instruments of Rossmont [luo si meng te 5012 
2448 5536 3676], program-controlled switchboards of Belgium's 
Bell Company, and Japan's JVC electronic products. Besides, 
over 300 scientific and technological groups comprising research 
institutes and institutions of higher learning have made their 
way into Pudong, and 13 high-technology projects are underway in 
the Zhangjiang High-Technology Garden.... 
<H3>  Reform at the Municipality's Own Expense and With Initiative 
in Its Own Hand </H3>
  Wu Bangguo, member of the CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau and secretary of the Shanghai Municipal CPC 
Committee, said: Under the precondition of ensuring the 
socialist orientation, guaranteeing adequate contribution to the 
treasury, and obeying the center's macroregulation and control, 
Shanghai will seek reform at is own expense and with initiative 
held in its own hands. Zhang Qizheng, vice mayor and chairman 
of the Pudong New Zone, maintained that 1994 is "the year of 
image" for profiling Pudong's development. 
  It is learned that the chief persons in charge of Shanghai 
Municipality have promised Deng Xiaoping to achieve the goal of 
"doubling" the business volume in Pudong within three years. 
Deng Xiaoping emphasized: We can only move ahead, not 
backtrack, in developing Pudong. If we carry on at such a pace, 
Pudong will be very different by 1995 and I will still be around 
to see it. 
  At the moment, Shanghai has more than 50 corporate banks 
(head offices or branches) and financial companies, as well as 
over 80 offices of foreign banks. By the end of this century, 
Shanghai will have over 100 Chinese and foreign financial 
institutions. This, plus the development and improvement of the 
securities market, money market, exchange market, and gold 
market and the expansion of the futures market, port trade, and 
wholesale and retail business, will help Shanghai develop into 
an international financial and trade center at a faster pace. 
The authoritative personality said: Pudong will try 
to raise 200 billion yuan in the coming seven years to put into 
various projects through such varied channels as absorbing 
foreign capital, bringing in domestic capital, bank financing, 
issuing securities, foundation operations, the "BOT" [preceding 
word published in English] procedure, and input by the financial 
authorities. By the end of this century, Pudong's annual GNP 
will exceed 80 billion yuan, which will account for a quarter of 
the GNP of the whole of Shanghai, while its proportion in the 
municipal GNP in 1990 was one fourteenth. There is a big 
chance that Pudong can be built into an Eastern Shanghai that 
has first-rate municipal works, a first-rate business activity 
center, a first-rate comprehensive free trade zone, a first-rate 
export and processing base, first-rate suburban agriculture, and 
first-rate quality of life. 
  Wu Bangguo clearly pointed out that maintaining a good 
social 
atmosphere has always been in the minds of Shanghai's leadership 
groups. This indicates the building of Shanghai's spiritual 
civilization will be strengthened. 
<H5>  Zhu Is Praised by Deng for Managing the Economy </H5>
  Since Deng Xiaoping made his talks in southern China two 
years ago, great changes have taken place in the economic and 
social life on the Chinese mainland. The growth rate of the 
national economy has been at a high level of 13 percent for two 
years running, while the economic growth rate of the seven 
Western powers last year was only 1.3 percent, one tenth of 
China's. The pace of development in China in the 1990's indeed 
attracted worldwide attention. The GNP leaping from 2 trillion 
to 2.4 trillion and then to over 3 trillion yuan has given the 
general public graphic proof of the growing national strength 
and the improvement of their life. As a result, Deng Xiaoping's 
thinking on reform, opening up, and market economy has been more 
extensively accepted by the people. 
  However, there are still many criticisms from abroad 
regarding Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Rongji's rectifying the 
monetary order and strengthening and improving macroregulation 
and control in the second half of last year. In fact, Zhu 
Rongji is not only dubbed by Deng Xiaoping as a cadre who has an 
expert knowledge of economy, but is also considered as someone 
who understands Deng's line the best. Zhu Rongji emphasized the 
need to implement Deng Xiaoping's ideas and theories in an 
active, comprehensive, and correct manner. Whoever fails to 
seize the opportunity will be condemned by history, and so will 
be anyone who does not seek truth from facts, makes rash 
advances blindly, and consequently causes big ups and 
downs. Zhu Rongji maintained that it is necessary to 
constantly study and analyze all the phenomena and problems in 
economic life, so as to obtain a correct understanding of things 
from them and master the law of economic development. Once we 
correctly understand and master the laws governing economic 
development, we will be able to greatly speed up economic 
development. Slow speed is not something we are after, but it 
is hard to describe how fast development should be in absolute 
terms. We want a rational speed and a speed that is in line with 
reality. Fast speeds must also have a limit. If there are big 
ups and downs and inflation, it means development is too fast. 
It is the right speed if this border is not overstepped. The 
speed of economic development should follow the six-character 
requirement, that is, it should be fast [kuai su 1816 6643], 
sustained [chi xu 2170 4958], and healthy [jian kang 0256 1660], 
so that the structure is optimized and the efficiency enhanced. 
Otherwise, if the annual growth rate goes up to 20 percent 
while the revenue collected is inadequate, it will not be a 
healthy development. There is the element of market as well as 
those of planning and macroregulation and control in market 
economy. They are all aspects of the market economy. 
  In the middle of January, at the national financial work 
conference held in Beijing, Zhu Rongji made an important speech 
in the capacities of vice premier and governor of the People's 
Bank of China [PBC]. He once again affirmed the achievements in 
rectifying the monetary order last year and emphasized the need 
to carry on with the task consistently and unremittingly in 
accordance with the existing agreed rules. This indicates that 
the CPC authorities do not intend to relax the tight credit 
without much consideration and allow various negative 
competitions and "overheating" phenomena to rise again. 
What is important is that this measure apparently was 
approved by Deng Xiaoping. Zhu Rongji not only reported his 
work to Deng, but also received a new instruction from him, 
"running the banks truly as banks" instead turning them into 
"money issuing companies" and "coffers," still less unlocked 
"coffers." This is obviously meant to avoid Russia's 
experience of quick devaluation of the ruble that caused high 
inflation. 
<H5>  Deng Re-Emphasized the Need To Seize Opportunities </H5>
  Because reforms of the finance and taxation structure, 
monetary structure, and foreign trade structure are crucial to 
the CPC's effort to achieve major breakthroughs in reform, 
change government functions, and improve and strengthen 
macroregulation and control this year, Zhu Rongji, who is in 
charge of the reforms and consultations in this respect, has 
shown no sign of resigning as PBC governor. In fact, it will 
indeed be quite difficult to find a leading cadre who is at 
least a state councillor to replace Governor Zhu at the Second 
Session of the Eighth NPC to be held in March this year. 
Nevertheless, because Zhu Rongji is really too busy with his 
official duties, there is a possibility that someone may take 
over his governorship at an appropriate time. One may say that 
Zhu Rongji is a key figure who is good at regulating and 
stabilizing the economy at a time when the Chinese Government is 
trying to switch over to the market economic mechanism. He once 
said: If China continues to grow at a rate of 8 to 10 percent 
each year, in 20 years' time the superiorities of the new system 
will be fully manifested. 
  Deng Xiaoping, who has affirmed the accomplishments of 
the third-generation leadership group with Jiang Zemin at the 
core, most ardently wishes that "opportunities must be seized 
and decisionmaking must be timely." The strong momentum of 
China's development has inspired him, whereupon he concluded 
that China will become an economic power before long and now it 
is already a political power. 
<H3>  Stability Is the Key Word in Political Reform; Cadres Should 
Be Renewed </H3>
  Since the 13th National CPC Congress, the proposals and 
appeals for reform of political structure have experienced a few 
ups and downs. Since the 14th party congress, the number one 
and number two men of the CPC top echelon, namely, Jiang Zemin 
and Li Peng, have on many public occasions mentioned the 
necessity of political reform matching economic reform. But the 
focus has been shifted to emphasizing the reforms for 
streamlining the organization and enhancing the efficiency of 
operation. The formulation of "separating the functions of the 
party from those of the government" has been substituted by 
"cross-appointment [jiao cha jian zhi 0074 0643 0369 5120]." 
The plan to let democratic parties participate in one third of 
government and political affairs, formulated toward the end of 
the 1980's, has also been shelved. 
The authoritative CPC personality believes that 
democratic reforms depend on the improvement of the people's 
level of education, otherwise they cannot draw clear 
distinctions concerning cardinal issues of right and wrong. The 
dissatisfaction of the masses toward such problems as unhealthy 
tendencies in society, corrupt phenomena, unfair distribution, 
price increases, and problematic public order can easily be 
taken advantage of by political speculators and even lead to 
social turmoil. This will not only go against the original 
objective of reform, but also sabotage stability and unity and 
even impede economic progress. Therefore, Deng Xiaoping 
pointed out in the 1990's that in terms of political structural 
reform, the biggest objective is to obtain a stable environment. 
The crux of the issue in China is that the communist party 
should have a good political bureau, especially a good standing 
committee of the political bureau. As long as this link does 
not go wrong, China will be as stable as Tai Shan. 
  One can be sure that the composition and division of 
responsibilities in the third-generation leadership group of the 
CPC will not have significant changes for a period of time. 
This is necessary for keeping the overall political situation 
stable. 
<H3>  Promote Only Capable People and Appoint Them to Appropriate 
Positions According to Their Strengths </H3>
  However, the CPC is also fully aware of the urgency of 
choosing successors that carry forward its cause into the next 
century. On the one hand, the current chief leaders are mostly 
quite old and on the other hand, in the course of establishing 
the new system of market economy, China is faced with the 
challenges of new science and technology and professional 
knowledge. With the deepening of the reform, the difficulties 
encountered in various fields will be even greater. 
  In view of this, the CPC's organizational and personnel 
system and its contingent of cadres will show three changes in 
the context of market economy. 
  1. The change from the political mode to the economic mode. 
Cadres are required not only to be able to do political work, 
but also to have capabilities for taking the economy in hand and 
regulating the market. A large number of cadres who have good 
knowledge of economics and the know-how of management will be 
recruited. In the meantime, efforts will be made to strengthen 
the training in economic knowledge and modern scientific 
management, so as to help cadres shift from the political mode 
to the economic mode. 
  2. The change from doing intangible work to doing tangible 
work. Deng Xiaoping pointed out: Shenzhen is a result of 
practical work, not a product of meetings or articles. 
Cadres should have the spirit of not blindly following what is 
in the book or what is said by authorities, but acknowledging 
only what is true. They should be liberated from the mountain 
of documents and the sea of meetings, go into reality, and do 
practical things well. 
  3. The change from the serving type to the trailblazing 
type. 
With the establishment of the market economy, the government 
functions have switched from total monopoly to macroregulation 
and control. All cadres are required to be creative, think 
independently, do things in their own ways, keep abreast of the 
current situation, have a good command of broad and specific 
policies and principles, and carry out pioneering work. 
  The CPC high-level personality suggested that only by 
changing the way we think and breaking the conventional confines 
can we find true leadership talent for the new era. It is 
necessary to change, in earnest, the old mentality of paying 
excessive attention to enthusiasm to the neglect of creativity. 
When assessing and selecting a leading cadre, it is not enough 
to find out whether or not he has enthusiasm and initiative, is 
diligent and conscientious, and willingly bear the burden of 
office. We should also find out if he has creativity, thinks in 
a new dimension, and is good at thinking matters over, offering 
suggestions, and conducting work in a creative way. It is 
necessary to continue the effort to break the mentality of 
demanding perfection and nitpicking and adopt the concept of 
using people according to their strengths. Some people are 
broad-minded and bold in reforms. If they are sent to a region 
or a department, they can quickly reverse the backward situation 
there and accomplish even the most difficult things. But they 
may have many shortcomings and even make mistakes. We should 
analyze such people's strengths and weaknesses, warmheartedly 
help them overcome their shortcomings, and boldly use them. It 
is necessary to thoroughly correct the mentality of considering 
qualifications and arranging ranks according to seniority and 
adopt the concept that "capable people should occupy vital 
positions." We must, without delay, boldly promote excellent 
cadres who are young and promising, show strong potential, and 
are capable of opening up new prospects so that we truly promote 
capable people and appoint them to appropriate positions 
according to their strengths. This is also an important 
guarantee of the country's prosperity.

Correspondent Hsin Li (2450 0448): "Zhu Rongji Is Angry With 
Overheated Property Development"] 
  [Text] Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, member of the CPC 
Political Bureau Standing Committee, who is responsible for 
economic matters, was nicknamed "iron-headed Zhu" by civilians 
for handling affairs in a decisive manner and for being bold, 
resolute, and honest in his work. He recently officiated at 
several important economic meetings and visited several places 
to learn about the situations there. He bluntly expressed his 
dissatisfaction with the overheated property development, the 
slow pace in bringing order out of chaos in the financial 
market, and the excessive scale of investment. He demanded that 
cadres in all localities continue to follow the red-letterhead 
document on strengthening macroeconomic control and act 
according to their capacity by resolutely suspending or delaying 
the construction of a number of projects. He was angry with 
officials in various sectors having their own way and "refusing 
to safeguard the authority of the central government." He was 
furious with Guangdong and other provinces for resisting the 
central decision to impose the value-added land tax. In the 
first half of this year, he will take strong measures to tighten 
up on investment and loans, cool down the overheated property 
market, and bring down inflation. 
  According to Beijing economic circles, while Zhu, who was 
promoted by Deng Xiaoping, favored the call to "seize the 
favorable opportunity to speed up economic development," he kept 
a wary eye on the possibility that local economic growth would 
endanger the macroeconomic control exercised by the central 
government. He believed the central government must have 
abundant funds at its command before it can exercise effective 
macroeconomic control. The supply of funds, energy, raw and 
semifinished materials, and transport services must be taken 
into account in planning to increase the GNP, and we must not 
"rush headlong into mass action" and "hanker after something 
sensational, but impractical," all over again, he said. 
  In recent speeches, he has reiterated the need to straighten 
out the "bubble economy" at a greater pace, to effectively 
recover loans made in breach of the regulations, to cool down 
the real estate craze and the rush to set up development zones, 
and to earnestly tighten up on bank loans and fixed-asset 
investment. 
  Fixed-asset investment in 1993 was as high as 1,150 billion 
yuan, up 44 percent over the planned 800 billion yuan, and up 47 
percent over total 1992 investment. The economic growth rate 
and fixed-asset investment planned for 1994 are 9 percent and 
1,300 billion yuan, respectively. Zhu was quoted by an 
economist in Beijing as saying: The investment scale is large 
enough already. Provinces are not allowed to vie with one 
another in launching construction projects, and leading cadres 
of local governments must be held responsible for undesirable 
consequences arising from improper investment. Zhu was highly 
critical of some provinces that had refused to do away with 
unacceptable economic development zones and had engaged in 
property development irrespective of actual conditions. The 
circular issued by the State Council in late January on 
strengthening macrocontrol over fixed-asset investment was 
prompted mainly by Zhu's idea of guarding against economic 
overheating. 
  Zhu reiterated the need to enforce the following "three 
regulations": No borrowing in breach of the regulations is 
allowed, no unauthorized interest increase or interest increase 
in a disguised form is allowed, and financial organs must sever 
ties with the economic entities they have established. In 
particular, he demanded that central departments and local 
governments try their best to prevent the recurrence of 
unauthorized fund-raising. He believed that only when bank 
loans and unauthorized fund-raising are controlled can the real 
estate craze be cooled down and the scale of fixed-asset 
investment curbed. He required banks in all localities 
immediately to break the debt chains of the financial offices, 
put an end to the situation in which "the bank's 
account-settling channel is stopped up and funds cannot be 
transferred readily [hui lu bu chang 0565 6424 0008 2545]," and 
forestall the possibility of banks not being able to provide 
cash for their customers. 
  A Guangzhou official was quoted by Beijing economic circles 
as saying in Hong Kong some days ago that Guangzhou would not 
impose the value-added land tax. "Iron-headed Zhu" said this is 
nonsense, claiming: The provisional regulations on levying the 
value-added land tax will be carried out. All localities must 
submit themselves to the central government, rather than 
"countering central policies with local ones." All tax laws 
enacted by local governments which run against central policies 
are invalid. 
  There was a hot dispute in the CPC hierarchy over the 
relationship between development speed and economic stability. 
Chen Yun has been insisting that "the scale of economic 
construction correspond to national strength" and that the 
principle of doing what is within our capacity must be followed 
in arranging fixed- asset investment so as to strike a balance 
in finance, credit, materials supply and demand, and foreign 
exchange. He once said: "How many capital construction projects 
can be launched is not determined by how much money we have, but 
by how many raw and semifinished materials are available." He 
also maintained that in arranging the scale of economic 
construction, the restraining effect of agricultural development 
on economic growth rate must be taken into account. 
  Zhu and other third-generation leaders in central leadership 
now are seeking a compromise program that will accommodate Deng 
Xiaoping's call to "speed up economic development" and Chen 
Yun's call to "do what the country is capable of" because, on 
the one hand, they support Deng's plan "to bring about a period 
of particularly rapid development every few years," and on the 
other, they must take into account Chen's principle of "seeking 
development under a stable situation." Evidently, economic 
reform will deepen in 1994, but the State Council will curb 
blind investment by local governments, including "excessive 
development" in real estate and development zones.

<F P=106> [By Zhan Xu (6124 2485), Anhui provincial radio station </F>
reporter, and ANHUI RIBAO reporter Guan Xuefu (4619 1331 1381): 
"Provincial Foreign Affairs Office Directors Conference Urges 
Localities To Gear Foreign Affairs Work to Needs of Reform, 
Opening Up, and Economic Construction"] 
  [Text] A provincial conference of foreign affairs office 
directors was held in Hefei from 24 to 26 January. 
  The main items on the conference agenda were to transmit the 
guidelines of the sixth conference of provincial, regional, and 
municipal foreign affairs offices; to review Anhui's foreign 
affairs work, and to decide on this year's tasks in foreign 
affairs and foreign liaison. 
  Governor Fu Xishou attended and spoke at the conference, 
while Yang Liangduo, vice governor and concurrently director of 
the provincial foreign affairs office, delivered a work report. 
  The conferees agreed: In 1993 Anhui, saw the fastest and 
most productive growth of its economy, as well as an 
accelerating pace of opening to the outside world. Today an 
excellent situation of multidirectional opening at various 
levels and through different channels has taken shape in the 
province. Workers engaged in foreign affairs have made their 
share of contributions to promoting the sustained, rapid, and 
healthy growth of the provincial economy and to accelerating the 
pace of opening to the outside world. 
  In his speech, the governor said: Local governments should 
further gear their foreign affairs work to the needs of economic 
construction, reform, and opening up. To effectively carry out 
foreign affairs work, they should familiarize themselves with 
the pulse of local economic developments as well as with some 
knowledge of economics. 
  He emphasized: We should strengthen the centralized, unified 
leadership over foreign affairs work and the management by the 
relevant departments. Principal party and government leaders at 
all levels should show concern for and support foreign affairs 
and should bring into full play the functions of foreign affairs 
offices, which can only be strengthened, not weakened. Foreign 
affairs offices should help party committees and governments 
implement to the letter the central authorities' principles and 
policies on foreign affairs. They should give good advice and 
serve as competent assistants to the party committees and 
governments while providing quality service to other departments 
and units. He added: Foreign affairs and foreign liaison 
departments at all levels should fight corruption and promote 
clean government to intensify the building of spiritual 
civilization. They should firmly crack down on and correct some 
unhealthy practices and chaotic situations in contacts with 
foreign affairs matters, in striving to score periodic results 
to ensure Anhui's opening in a sound, orderly manner. 
  In his report, Yang Duoliang emphasized: Foreign affairs 
departments should foster an overall concept of foreign affairs 
and improve work in the following seven areas: 1) strengthening 
management to ensure that Anhui's foreign affairs work proceeds 
in a healthy, orderly way; 2) actively expanding contacts with 
foreign countries by inviting more persons to visit Anhui and 
sending more persons abroad; 3) increasing exchanges with 
foreign countries in various forms and through different 
channels; 4) strengthening the functions of foreign affairs 
offices and improving the quality of their staff members; 5) 
reinforcing discipline in foreign affairs work and enhancing the 
security concept to safeguard the national dignity and security; 
6) stepping up publicity to foreign countries to make Anhui and 
the degree of its opening better known to the outside world; and 
7) strengthening the leadership to go all-out in promoting the 
opening to the outside world.

  [Text] Beijing, February 8 (XINHUA) -- Ambassadors of 16 
countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will 
meet on Wednesday [9 February] in Brussels on how to stop last 
Saturday's massacre of civilians in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo 
from happening again. 
  The NATO ambassadors will face a tough time deciding whether 
to approve air strike against Serbian positions in Sarajevo or 
not. 
  A shell explosion Saturday at noon in a downtown Sarajevo 
marketplace has so far killed 68 people and wounded 200, all of 
them civilians. 
  The Bosnian Government accused Serbs of the shelling. The 
Serbs denied it, and the command of U.N. Peace-Keeping Force in 
Bosnia has not decided yet on who was responsible for the 
shelling. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton Monday expressed support to a 
U.N. call for NATO approval of air strikes against Bosnian Serbs. 
  U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali Sunday asked the 
NATO to approve air strike on Bosnian Serbian positions around 
Sarajevo. 
  France Monday urged the European Union to impose an 
ultimatum 
on the Bosnian Serbs for either removing their artillery from 
the bills surrounding Sarajevo or facing Western military 
intervention. 
  But France's efforts failed at Monday's European Community 
foreign ministers' meeting, and instead, the EC asked the NATO 
to discuss at a regular weekly ambassadors' meeting on Wednesday 
"all means necessary" to immediately lift the siege on Sarajevo, 
air strike included. 
  Meanwhile, the option for air strike has been opposed by 
Russia, Greece and Canada. 
  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said on Monday that 
bombing Serbian positions will be the "least successful" 
response to the killing in Sarajevo. 
  Within the NATO, Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias 
said after the EC foreign ministers' meeting that there was "a 
convergence of view that there is no alternative solution to the 
Bosnian peace plan of the European Union." 
  Canada, which participated in U.N. Peace-Keeping Operations 
in Bosnia, has also expressed opposition to the use of air 
strike. 
  The European peace plan aims to divide Bosnia-Herzegovina 
into three ethnic states. The Serbs and Croats have accepted 
the plan, while the Muslim side has rejected it. 
  Despite all these, the ASSOCIATED PRESS quoted an unnamed 
NATO source as saying that the sense at the NATO headquarters is 
that "there has to be a more muscular response, that they have 
to be serious about air strike" when NATO ambassadors meet on 
Wednesday. 
  The source said that any air strike on Serbian positions 
will 
only have political objectives, such as the withdrawal of the 
Serbs and putting under the control of NATO forces artillery on 
the hills around Sarajevo. 
  Aircraft-carriers of the United States, France and Britain 
are reportedly increasing their activities in the Adriatic Sea, 
and the NATO air bases in southern Italy are in full readiness 
for air strike. 
  If the NATO approves a definite plan to oust Serbian forces 
from the hills surrounding Sarajevo through air strike, it is 
expected to ask the U.N. secretary general to issue an order. 
  However, some NATO countries and Russia have asked Ghali to 
put the issue for discussion in the U.N. Security Council, where 
Russia has a power to veto any resolution. 
  Legally, Ghali needs not consult the Security Council 
because 
the latter has already adopted resolutions putting some Bosnian 
cities, including Sarajevo, under U.N. protection as "security 
zones."

  [Text] Geneva, February 8 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese delegate to 
the 50th session of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights stressed 
here today the right to promote economic development and the 
need to create a peaceful environment for development. 
  In his speech on the right to development, Pang Sen, 
alternate representative of China to the meeting, which is under 
way here, said the basic objective in realizing the right to 
development is to promote economic development, particularly 
that of the developing nations. 
  "In considering the question of the realization of the right 
to development, the working group on the right to development 
should face the reality of the current international economic 
relations and the difficult situation of the developing 
countries and should pay special attention to the development 
needs of the developing countries," he said. 
  He noted that "the development of all countries in the world 
is interrelated and the realization of the right to development 
is important to both the developing and developed countries." 
  "With the growing interdependence of economies between all 
countries, the universal significance of the realization of the 
right to development is becoming more evident," he said. 
  The Chinese delegate also noted that given the past 
experiences, the realization of the right to development is more 
difficult than the universal recognition of such right. 
  "While the obstacles to the realization of the right to 
development are various, more attention should be paid to the 
elimination of the most important ones," he stressed. 
  "We are of the view that the working group should give 
priority consideration to the elimination of those obstacles 
affecting peace and stability in all countries, since economic, 
social, cultural and political development of a country requires 
a peaceful and stable domestic and international environment." 
  He pointed out that attention should be paid to the 
elimination of those obstacles which affect cooperation among 
states on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. 
  Judging from history and present reality, he said, the 
unbalance in development between developing and developed 
countries is mainly caused by the unfair and unjust 
international economic order, while the attachment of 
unreasonable conditions to economic cooperation and trade by 
some developed countries has aggravated the difficulties faced 
by the developing countries in development. 
  With respect to the relationship between democracy and 
development, the Chinese delegate expressed the view that 
development, democracy and human rights are mutually 
complementary and mutually reinforcing. 
  "While political democracy, full respect of human rights of 
people and perfection of rule of law are beneficial to economic 
and social development, economic development could relieve 
people of their poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy, etc., thus 
creating necessary conditions for the full and better enjoyment 
of all human rights by the people," he added. 
  "Based on its own experience of reform and opening to the 
outside world, China realizes that to achieve a steady and 
sustainable development of the economy and ensure the full 
enjoyment of the benefit of development by the people, a country 
has to first of all maintain its national and social stability." 
  "It is only under this precondition can a country 
concentrate 
on developing its economy, raising the living standard of its 
people, strengthening democracy and rule of law," he declared. 
  "Any unbalanced emphasis on one factor to the neglect of 
another and any attempt to copy the development strategies and 
political models of others which do not fit the conditions of 
the country will bring unfavorable consequences to the 
realization of the right to development and the full enjoyment 
of various human rights and fundamental freedoms of its people," 
Pang said.

<F P=106> ["Special feature" by Pan Yi (3382 3015): "Vietnamese-U.S. </F>
Relations Will Enter a New Phase"] 
  [Text] Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai announced 
on 4 February that Vietnam soon will establish a liaison office 
in Washington as a transitional step toward the overall 
restoration of Vietnamese-U.S. diplomatic relations. He 
declined, however, to make a conjecture on the exact timing for 
the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two 
countries. 
  Public opinion has taken note of the fact that it was after 
U.S. President Clinton announced the lifting of 19-year trade 
embargo against Vietnam on 3 February that Le Mai made known 
Vietnam's stance. It has been learned that the U.S. liaison 
office in Hanoi is currently under construction. 
  The United States started imposing trade sanctions against 
Vietnam in 1964, targeting them exclusively at North Vietnam at 
that time. In 1975, the U.S. Army lost the war on the 
Vietnamese battlefields and the U.S.-backed South Vietnamese 
puppet regime collapsed soon after. Flying into a rage from 
shame, the United States expanded the trade sanctions to all of 
Vietnam. 
  Since it carried out reform in the mid 1980's, Vietnam has 
seen an economic growth of 5.3 percent. Now, per capita annual 
income has reached $217 and the inflation rate dropped from 70 
to 15 percent. Over the past few years, the Vietnamese 
Government has approved 560 investment projects, entailing 
investment of $4.5 billion. Vietnam is now attracting foreign 
capital in the following ways: On the one hand, Vietnam has 
stepped up efforts to hold negotiations with the United States, 
the "chief" of the Western allies, has strongly demanded that 
the United States lift its trade embargo against Vietnam on the 
condition that Vietnam provide help in finding U.S. servicemen 
missing since the war. On the other hand, Vietnam also is 
trying to do business with other Western countries through 
various channels, with a view to breaking the U.S. blockade. In 
recent years, many countries and regions -- including France, 
Japan, Britain, Hong Kong, and Taiwan -- have made huge 
investments in Vietnam. The anti-Vietnamese alliance pieced 
together by the United States has collapsed. Moreover, having 
long been resentful of the stubbornness of the government, U.S. 
business circles have made repeated appeals for an early lifting 
of trade embargo against Vietnam. 
  Under this pressure, the Bush administration announced in 
February 1992 a partial lifting of trade sanctions against 
Vietnam; meanwhile, it also lifted bans prohibiting U.S. 
enterprises from establishing representative offices in Vietnam 
as well as signing contracts with Vietnam. U.S. enterprise 
circles immediately responded to the call. In no time, two 
world-famous companies -- Whirlpool and Compaq -- had signed 
contracts with Vietnam on selling computers and other products 
to Vietnam. Companies like Lockheed [luo ke xi de 3157 0344 
1585 1795], Goldman Sachs [ge de man sa ke si 2047 1795 2581 
5646 0344 2448] and Coca-Cola also were unwilling to lag behind; 
one after another they sought business opportunities in Vietnam. 
However, the new Clinton administration was not eager to improve 
U.S. ties with Vietnam. Clinton once indicated in clear-cut 
terms that the trade embargo would not be lifted before 
"substantial" headway had been made in the search for U.S. 
servicemen missing in action. This position has deterred U.S. 
enterprises from investing in Vietnam, and all contracts already 
signed between the two sides were subject to the additional 
condition that they could take effect only after the overall 
lifting of trade sanctions. 
  In the face of increasingly intensified global economic and 
trade wars, however, the United States has become more and more 
reluctant to give up the huge Vietnamese market, and it began to 
quicken its steps toward reconciliation with Vietnam. Last 
year, some U.S. congressmen and government officials visited 
Vietnam, and they reaffirmed the efforts Vietnam had made in 
helping investigate the whereabouts of missing U.S. military 
personnel. Since the beginning of this year, the United States 
has sent to Vietnam nearly 10 delegations from Congress, 
military organs, and enterprise circles. Charles Larson, chief 
of the U.S. Pacific command, visited Vietnam on 16 January. He 
is the highest-ranking U.S. officer ever to visit Vietnam since 
the United States broke off diplomatic relations with Vietnam in 
1975. Public opinion believed that the U.S. plan to lift trade 
sanctions against Vietnam was in the run-up. 
  On 27 January, the U.S. Senate passed a bill, with 62 votes 
for and 38 against, urging the government to lift the trade 
embargo against Vietnam. The result of the vote meant a cardiac 
stimulant to Clinton, for it enabled him to deal with the strong 
resentment of U.S. veterans' groups with perfect assurance. 
Conditions for the lifting of trade sanctions against Vietnam 
finally became ripe.

<F P=106> ["International Jottings" by Rui Yingjie (5360 5391 2638): </F>
"A Review of Coordination in January"] 
  [Text] In the first month of this year, 
coordination-oriented dialogue was held continuously in the 
international community, especially between the various big 
powers. In many cases, such dialogue achieved positive results. 
This is obviously a good omen. 
  The messages from Beijing were inspiring. First, French 
Prime Minister Balladur's special envoy, Peyferitte, visited 
China; then China and France issued a joint communique on 12 
January after consultations. The French Government reaffirmed 
that it only recognized the PRC Government as the sole legal 
government of China, and guaranteed that it would no longer 
approve any involvement by French enterprises in the sale of 
arms to Taiwan. This changed the unharmonious relationship 
between the two countries after France decided to sell fighters 
to Taiwan in late 1992. After that, Chinese Foreign Minister 
Qian Qichen visited Paris and met with French President 
Mitterrand and other French leaders. Both sides held that a new 
chapter had opened in the relationship between the two countries. 
  Then, Jennifer Hillman, chief U.S. trade negotiator, visited 
Beijing, and the fourth round of bilateral textile trade talks 
was held. A memorandum of understanding was signed on 17 
January, and this averted a trade war between the two countries. 
Immediately after that, U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen 
visited China, and a joint statement was issued after a meeting 
of the Sino-U.S. Joint Economic Committee announcing that the 
United States "supports a stable, prosperous, and modern China." 
This indicated that China and the United States had taken a 
major step to further develop their relations. 
  Coordination between the Western countries and between the 
Western countries and the countries of Eastern Europe and the 
former Soviet Union also achieved positive results. On 10 and 
11 January, U.S. President Clinton attended the NATO summit 
meeting in Brussels. As a result of this coordination, NATO 
accepted a U.S.-proposed "peace partnership" scheme, and this 
mitigated the contradictions with Russia caused by the original 
plan to expand the scope of NATO to some East European 
countries. After that, Clinton visited Moscow. After the 
United States and Russia held consultations with Ukraine, on 14 
January, the presidents of the three countries signed an 
agreement on dismantling nuclear weapons inside the territory of 
Ukraine. Thus, a major problem of the nuclear arsenal left over 
from the Cold War was solved. 
  As for regional problems, President Clinton and Syrian 
President al-Asad held talks in Geneva in a harmonious 
atmosphere, and the talks brought about an opportunity to reopen 
the Israeli-Syrian talks. While the implementation of the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement has encountered difficulties, PLO 
Chairman 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Peres held a 
meeting when attending the annual conference of the World 
Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. They discussed ways to 
settle differences between the two sides. Reportedly, the talks 
between the Palestinian and Israeli leaders have "approached the 
conclusion of a final agreement." 
  Some goodwill messages also came from the talks between the 
United States and the DPRK on the development of nuclear weapons 
in Korea. On 29 January, Billy Graham, a representative of 
American evangelical Christianity, met President Kim Il-sung in 
Pyongyang, and conveyed a message from President Clinton to 
President Kim. Graham and Kim Il-sung "held talks in a sincere 
and friendly atmosphere." This indicated the "determination to 
make efforts to establish a peaceful and friendly relationship 
between the two countries." 
  Disputes continue to occur among various countries, and the 
world is full of contradictions. Using force and exercising 
pressure only intensifies the contradictions. Only dialogue on 
an equal footing will reduce trouble and turn danger into 
safety. It is hoped that the trend of coordination and dialogue 
shown in January 1994 will continue, and this will provide a 
bright future to the world.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Britain's HK, Hong Kong, Airport Plan </F>
Criticized"] 
  [Text] A statement was issued by the Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office under the State Council on the new Hong Kong 
airport on January 25. 
  The statement said that the Hong Kong British authorities 
disregarding objections by the Chinese side, allowed the Hong 
Kong-British Legislative Council (Legco) to pass a bill last 
week allocating HK [Hong Kong] $1.67 billion for the new airport 
project, before any agreement had been reached between China and 
Britain on the financial arrangement for the new airport. They 
also decided to apply to Legco for another appropriation of 
HK$4.6 billion. 
  According to the British side, the debt to be left over to 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region after 1997 will run 
up to over HK$45 billion, under the present financial 
arrangement for the airport project. It will be nine times the 
total debt limit set in the memorandum of understanding signed 
by the heads of governments of China and Britain. 
  By continuing to apply for fund allocation when the whole 
financial arrangement by the British side has already violated 
the memorandum of understanding, the statement noted, the Hong 
Kong authorities are creating further obstacles to talks on the 
Hong Kong new airport project. 
  The Chinese side declared in the statement that before any 
agreement on the financial arrangement for the new airport 
project is reached by the two sides, 
  1. The Chinese side and the government of the future Hong 
Kong Special Administrative region will not be liable for any 
expenditure and debt incurred by building the new airport; 
  2. The land to be used and the prices of the land, including 
the land to be occupied by the new airport and the land to be 
used along the railway line leading to the airport, must be 
leased through the Sino-British Land Committee according to the 
provisions of Annex 3 of the Sino-British Joint Declaration; 
  3. All contracts associated with the new airport project 
that 
cover the time beyond June 30, 1997 that are approved by the 
Hong Kong British authorities without the consent of the Chinese 
side will be invalid after July 1, 1997; 
  4. Any law or ordinance associated with the new airport 
project adopted by the Hong Kong Legco will become invalid after 
July 1, 1997; 
  The Chinese government has always supported the construction 
of a new airport in Hong Kong, the statement said. In order to 
separate political issues from economic ones, it, has approved 
the land-to-sea project at Wanchai, Central, and the seabed 
tunnel project at the Western Harbor. 
  The statement expressed regrets over the British side's 
repeated breaches of the agreement reached between the two 
governments. However, it still hopes that the British side will 
earnestly deliberate ever the positive proposals raised by the 
Chinese side on reducing costs and debts, strengthening 
management and supervision, and producing a financial 
arrangement in accordance with the memorandum of understanding, 
so as to restore talks on the new airport issue.

<F P=106> [Article by Chen Hsiu-lien (7115 4423 5571): "Who Will </F>
Become Chief Executive of the Special Administrative Region?"] 
  [Excerpt] Making Preparations for Exercising 
Sovereignty Over Hong Kong Placed on the Agenda of the Central 
Meeting 
  The CPC hierarchy has discussed ways to step up the PWC's 
[Preliminary Work Committee] work process in making preparations 
to exercise sovereignty over Hong Kong. It was reported that 
the CPC Central Committee and the State Council have told 
various important sectors, including the important ministries 
and commissions under the State Council, the Association of 
Industry and Commerce, relevant public security and military 
departments, the Guangdong and Fujian Governments, and the 
Shenzhen Special Economic Zone bordering Hong Kong to do all 
supportive work well and to exert their utmost to achieve 
unification and to materialize the principle of "one country, 
two systems." Jiang Zemin said: "We must recover Hong Kong in 
1997. We must have this mettle." 
  Sino-British talks have broken down and China now cherishes 
no illusions about British cooperation in the run-up to 1997 and 
beyond. Just as Zhou Nan put it: "They can do whatever they 
like." To successfully carry out the principle of "one country, 
two systems" in Hong Kong in 1997 and to maintain Hong Kong's 
stability and prosperity, China has to successfully carry out 
several tasks, including choosing qualified administrators, 
especially the chief executive of the Special Administrative 
Region (SAR); strive to obtain sufficient financial reserves; 
unite with the Hong Kong people; retain qualified people; and 
avoid the possibility of shouldering various burdens. 
<H3>  Deng Xiaoping Said: The Future Hong Kong Government Should 
Be Stable and Powerful </H3>
  There are only three years left. 
  Deng Xiaoping said: Who is to be appointed the future SAR 
chief is a key issue. In the "second half" of the transitional 
period or after the change-over of sovereignty, the most 
important things to do are to maintain stability and prevent 
political, economic, monetary, and financial chaos. The SAR 
government must be stable and powerful. This is the key issue 
and the most important job is to choose the right men and use 
them properly. 
  It has been learned that Beijing has studied and looked at 
candidates for the SAR chief, and people outside the CPC 
hierarchy have also guessed as to who will be appointed SAR 
chief. According to a source, scores of Hong Kong people, 
including Leung Chun-ying, Rita Fan Hsu Lai-tai, Peter Woo, 
Vincent Lo Hong-sui, and Tsang Yuk-sing are potential candidates 
who are under consideration. 
  The SAR chief is a key position. Apart from "loving the 
country and Hong Kong," having a great intellect, and being 
eloquent, the ideal SAR chief must seemingly have the following 
qualifications. 
  1. He must be acceptable to the Beijing central government 
and familiar with Chinese operations and will not do anything 
detrimental to the central government. 
  2. He must be acceptable to all quarters in Hong Kong and 
able to take into account the interests of all quarters. 
  3. He must be capable of administrating and dealing with and 
having various complicated situations well in hand. 
<H3>  The SAR Chief Executive Must Handle Affairs in a Decisive 
and Effective Way and Take Into Account the Interests of Various 
Quarters </H3>
  What merits attention is: The statement "the future Hong 
Kong government must be stable and powerful" made by Deng 
Xiaoping means that, apart from being capable of administration, 
the SAR chief must be able to stand the test. Especially when 
confronted with a major challenge or turmoil, he is expected to 
stand firm, to handle affairs in a decisive manner, and, in 
particular, to boldly take "effective measures." In the 
meantime, the SAR chief must be able to further promote Hong 
Kong's prosperity and development, thus proving "Chinese are 
more resourceful than Britons and can exercise better 
leadership." He must also discharge his official duties by 
impartially refusing to side with vested interests, take into 
account the interests of various sectors, listen to the voices 
of various sectors in running the government properly, and 
adeptly solve problems according to the principle of "one 
country, two systems." 
  Beijing and Hong Kong are seeking such a person. Let us wait 
and see who will fill the post of SAR executive chief. 
  Naturally, apart from a good executive chief, qualified 
people in all fields and the continued display of high 
efficiency by the 200,000 government workers are also 
indispensable to a well-administered Hong Kong. Deng Xiaoping 
said: "Hong Kong people can administer Hong Kong well. It is 
essential to have confidence in ourselves." When China takes 
over Hong Kong, it will allow Hong Kong people to administer it. 
Whether Hong Kong will perform miracles again will become the 
criterion for appraising Hong Kong people's wisdom. [passage

this year. 
  Ambassador Guo Jiading, leader of the Chinese team,

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 9 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui 
Wednesday [9 February] urged people here to work hand in hand to 
create a more promising future for the nation. 
  "We are determined and confident that we will be able to 
begin a new era based on what we have achieved in the past," the 
president said in a message issued on the eve of the Chinese 
Lunar New Year. 
  President Li in his message, which was broadcast on TV and 
radio in Mandarin, Taiwanese and Hakka, wished his fellow 
countrymen a joyous holiday. 
  "Positive results were made in internal, foreign and 
economic 
affairs as well as in cultural and cross-strait relations during 
the past year," the president said. 
  He said that the successful outcome of the two local 
elections last year was evidence that Taiwan's democratic 
efforts have begun to pay off. 
  In economic affairs, he said that Taiwan registered a 
remarkable six percent growth amid worldwide stagnation last 
year. Besides, he added, a solid foundation has been laid for 
Taiwan to become an operations center in the Asia and Pacific 
area. 
  As to foreign affairs, Li said, Taiwan's effort to 
aggressively enter the international community have successfully 
won admiration and respect from many foreign nations. 
  President Li pointed out that Taiwan has created the most 
energetic new culture in Chinese history as a result of its 
success in harmonizing traditional and modern culture. 
  Referring to cross-strait relations, the president said that 
as a result of frequent civilian exchanges, mutual-understanding 
is increasing and the Taiwan experience is now exercising its 
influence on the mainland. 
  Li, however, said that Taiwan' development will not lead to 
its eventual separation from the mainland, though it is now 
aggressively seeking to play its part in the international 
community. 
  But the mainland has to shrug off its outdated ideology and 
systems so as to accelerate its economic modernization and 
political democratization. Only then can it work hand in hand 
with Taiwan to strive for Chinese glory.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 9 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui 
departed Wednesday [9 February] morning for Southeast Asia, 
embarking on a week-long private vacation journey to the 
Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand. 
  In his unofficial visit to Subic Bay, the first leg of the 
trip, Li will meet Philippine President Fidel Ramos over a 
luncheon and visit the bay area, where a major industrial 
processing zone exclusively for Taiwan investors will soon be 
developed. 
  Li and his entourage, which includes Foreign Affairs 
Minister 
Fredrick Chien [Chien Fu], chief economic planner Hsiao 
Wan-chang, and some business leaders, will arrive Wednesday 
evening in Bali, Indonesia where they will stay for a five-day 
vacation. 
  An unofficial meeting with President Suharto is part of Li's 
itinerary in Indonesia. 
  Li will also meet with Indonesian Research and Technology 
Minister Jusuf Bacharuddin Habibie for talks focusing on the 
development of Batam, an island south of Singapore which Jakarta 
is developing as an industrial zone. 
  Li, his wife and party are scheduled to leave Bali and 
travel 
to Phuket in Thailand on Feb. 14 for a two-day visit. 
  The president's economically significant vacation trip is 
scheduled to end on Feb. 16. 
  The presidential office has given low-key treatment to Li's 
"southern trip", apparently to shield the three Southeast Asian 
countries from any diplomatic embarrassment they might suffer 
because of their official links with Beijing.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 8 (CNA) -- The Republic of China 
[ROC]'s planned purchase of F-16 fighters will not be affected 
by US President Bill Clinton's order Monday [7 February] to 
close production lines for the aircraft, the Ministry of 
National Defense said Tuesday. 
  Although the production lines of F-16 fighters for the US 
Air 
Force will be closed, a ministry official said, production for 
foreign military sales will continue. 
  The official quoted a US Air Force spokesman as saying that 
the US Air Force does not want to buy any more F-16s because 
there is already an oversupply of the fighters. 
  The Bush administration agreed to sell Taiwan 150 F-16s in 
1992 defying strong protest from Beijing. The US Government has 
showed many times its commitment to fulfill the contract, the 
official added. 
  The first batch of fighters are expected to be delivered in 
mid-1996, he said.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 8 (CNA) -- The stock-breeding and 
food-processing industries are expected to be the most affected 
by Taiwan's entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs And 
trade, the Council for Economic Planning and Development said 
Tuesday [8 February]. 
  A council task force formed to evaluate the impact of GATT 
on 
the local economy said, though, that the rice-growing sector 
won't be as negatively affected as at first thought. Taiwan is 
expected to become a signatory to GATT by the end of the year. 
  Council Vice Chairman Hsue Chih said stock breeders and 
fruit 
farmers will be most affected by GATT membership, as the 
international trade body will require Taiwan to slash tariffs on 
farm products and abolish its quota system and import 
limitations. 
  Taiwan's gradual opening of its rice market, along with 
subsidiary payments to rice farmers, should keep the impact of 
GATT on those farmers to a minimum Hsue said.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 9 (CNA) -- Taiwan investment in 
Mainland China continued unabated, reaching US$6 billion last 
year, the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) 
said Tuesday [8 February]. 
  Taiwan's investments have become the second largest source 
of 
foreign capital in the mainland, second only to Hong Kong, CEPD 
said. 
  The growth rate of Taiwan's investment is stunning, up 600 
percent in 1993 from the previous year, CEPD added. 
  Statistics show that foreign investment in the mainland hit 
US$33 billion in 1993, up 200 percent from 1992, making it one 
of the largest magnets for foreign capital. 
  In 1993, Hong Kong invested US$13 billion in the mainland, 
accounting for 44 percent of total foreign investment, followed 
by Taiwan with US$6 billion, soaking up 18 percent of total 
foreign investment. Mainland China, with cheap labor, raw 
materials and a booming consumer market, will continue to 
attract investors from all over the world, and will be one of 
the fastest growing regions in the world, CEPD added. 
  The United States, Japan and Germany all expanded their 
investments in the mainland last year, CEPD said. Investments 
of the three countries grew more than 200 percent from the 
previous year, it added. 
  CEPD predicted that with a global economic rebound in sight, 
Mainland China will continue to enjoy a double-digit growth rate 
this year. 
  While the mainland continues to attract foreign investment, 
CEPD urged Taiwan businessmen to seize the chance to develop 
Taiwan into a regional financial center in Asia and Pacific and 
make Taiwan into a springboard for foreign manufacturers wanting 
to invest in the mainland.

  [Text] Budapest, Feb. 8 (CNA) -- Hungary is not ready to 
sign an agreement with Taiwan on either elimination of double 
taxation or investment protection. Mrs. Annamaria Kokeny, 
deputy head of the International Treaties Department, Ministry 
of Finance said in an interview with CNA that a treaty on the 
elimination of double taxation should be an intergovernmental 
agreement, but Hungary can't sign such a document because it has 
no diplomatic relationship with Taiwan. 
  The formalities needed to approve an investment protection 
treaty have been changed recently, she said. Now a 
parliamentary endorsement is also necessary, thus the legal 
situation is the same as in the case of other interstate 
treaties. 
  However, it would be possible to enter into an investment 
protection contract between the chambers of commerce. The 
Hungarian official added that such an agreement could include 
only recommendations and rules, and would not have mandatory 
force. In her view the existing laws and regulations on 
investments -- both in Hungary and Taiwan -- make most 
investments quite secure. 
  According to official records, Hungary has valid bilateral 
treaties or treaties awaiting parliamentary confirmation on the 
elimination of double taxation with 41 countries.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 8 (CNA) -- Taiwan investments in 
Malaysia through last year totaled US$5.915 billion, making the 
country the favorite target of Taiwan investors in Southeast 
Asia, the Ministry of Economic Affairs reported Tuesday [8 
February]. 
  Taiwan was the second largest foreign investor in Malaysia 
behind Japan, an official of the ministry's Industrial 
Development and Investment Center (IDIC) said. 
  In 1993 alone, Taiwan businesses invested US$346.50 million 
in 86 projects in Malaysia, most involving electronics and 
electrical appliance manufacturing, wood processing, textiles 
and rubber processing. 
  Although Taiwan investments in Singapore totaled US$562 
million, most of that came from Republic of China [ROC] 
nationals meeting an investment prerequisite for Singapore 
immigration purposes, the IDIC official said. 
  Vietnam, an up-and-coming favorite of Taiwan investors, 
absorbed 47 investments worth US$436.54 million from Taiwan last 
year. 
  Through 1993, Taiwan was the No. 1 foreign investor in 
Vietnam with investments totaling more than US$1.531 billion. 
The investments focused on footwear manufacturing and 
foodstuff, building material, textiles, and wood processing 
industries, the official added.

<F P=106> ["Commentary" by reporter Fan Liqing (5400 7787 7230): "The </F>
Earlier Talks on Economic Issues Start, the Greater the Benefits 
for Both Sides of the Strait"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 6 Feb (XINHUA) -- Compatriots across the 
strait are gratified by the progress made in the working 
discussions in Beijing between officials of the Association of 
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] and the Straits 
Exchange Foundation [SEF], which have marked a new phase of 
implementing the agreements reached at the "Wang-Gu" talks. 
That the topic on exchanges and cooperation in the fields of 
economy, trade, science and technology was not on the agenda of 
the discussions cannot but be considered a blemish on an 
otherwise very successful meeting. 
  The "Wang-Gu" talks in April 1993 were clearly defined by 
both sides as "nongovernmental, economic, routine, and 
functional." Among the four, the significance of the "economic" 
character cannot be overlooked. "Nongovernmental" and 
"functional" refer only to the objective characters of ARATS and 
SEF; the word "routine" defines the nature of the talks, which 
are aimed at solving existing problems arising from cross-strait 
contact and exchanges. Only the "economic" character manifests, 
in a forward-looking manner, increased cross-strait economic 
exchange, greater economic cooperation, and mutually beneficial 
cooperation that will contribute to prosperity and welfare on 
both sides of the strait. That the ARATS's proposal for 
inclusion of discussions on economic affairs was adopted at the 
"Wang-Gu talks" and was written into the "General Agreement on 
the Wang-Gu Talks" has broadened the immediate significance of 
the talks and made the agreement more popular across the strait; 
moreover, it meets the needs of cross-strait economic exchange 
and will serve as a guide for cross-strait economic exchange and 
trade. 
  The success of the "Wang-Gu talks" has injected new energy 
into nongovernmental economic exchanges and trade across the 
strait. While the tide of Taiwan businessmen's investment in the 
Mainland has been growing unabated, a new trend of large 
businesses and financial groups vying with one another for 
business opportunities on the mainland has emerged. Immediately 
after the "Wang-Gu talks" concluded, a delegation of officials 
from 15 private-sector banks in Taiwan made a fact-finding tour 
of the Mainland. It has been learned that 38 percent of the 270 
publicly listed companies in Taiwan have been authorized by 
their boards of directors to invest in the Mainland. Because of 
objections from the Taiwan authorities, most of these listed 
companies have not been able to implement their investment 
plans. Nonetheless, cross-strait trade and economic exchange 
grew rapidly in 1993. Statistics from the Taiwan side indicate 
that Taiwan's exports to Hong Kong in 1993 were $18.45 billion, 
up 19.7 percent over the previous year; imports stood at $1.72 
billion. Taiwan ran a trade surplus of $16.72 billion. 
According to an analysis by Taiwan's "Ministry of Economics," 
if trade with Hong Kong was excluded, Taiwan would have run a 
trade deficit $8.85 billion. Cross-strait entrepot trade 
accounts for the bulk of Taiwan's trade with Hong Kong; it is 
therefore clear that the Mainland has become a principal market 
for Taiwan's economic development. 
  A pattern of mutual reciprocity is emerging in cross-strait 
economic exchanges and trade. In terms of indirect trade, the 
Taiwan side is enjoying a huge surplus, which has to a 
considerable extent helped sustain Taiwan's economic prosperity; 
the Mainland side, on the other hand, has run a huge trade 
deficit. Out of political considerations, some officials in 
Taiwan have purposely made a political issue out of Taiwan's 
growing "dependence" on the Mainland. It should be pointed out, 
however, that the surplus-deficit situation in cross-strait 
trade was not created artificially. The deficits are, on one 
hand, due to the shift of production to Taiwan-funded 
enterprises on the Mainland; on the other hand, because of the 
Taiwan authorities' policy that places restrictions on the 
amount and grades of semifinished products exported from the 
Mainland to Taiwan, cross-strait economic exchanges and trade 
remain at rather low levels. Many people in the business 
circles of both sides have pointed out: If the ban on the import 
of Mainland high-tech semifinished products is lifted, it would 
not only help correct the trade imbalance but also improve 
Taiwan's competitiveness in the international market. In 
investment, investment by Taiwan businessmen has increased with 
each passing day, and protection for the rights and interests of 
Taiwan investors is being constantly improved. The Taiwan 
authorities, on the other hand, have set numerous restrictions 
on in Taiwan businessmen's investment in the Mainland. To this 
day people from the Mainland's economic and trade circles are 
barred from visiting Taiwan. Therefore, it is necessary for the 
ARATS and SEF to reach a consensus through economic discussions 
and work out measures for implementing higher-level exchange and 
cooperation under the principle of reciprocity. 
  Topics on economic affairs account for a significant part 
of the "General Agreement on the Wang-Gu Talks." They range 
from "covers the rights and interests of Taiwan investors in the 
Mainland and related issues," "the issue of mutual visits by 
industrialists and businessmen," "stepping up the development of 
energy and other resources and exchanges in this field," to 
"mutual visits by scientists, the exchange of scientific 
publications, discussions on the standardization of 
technological terms and the standardization of product 
specifications," and "scientific exchanges in the fields of 
computers and other industries." At the time of the "Wang-Gu 
talks," the two sides already had considerable differences over 
these issues which needed to be worked out through common 
efforts in later talks. Over the past half-year or so, the 
ARATS had made a great deal of preparations so that talks on the 
aforementioned topics could be placed on the agenda of ARATS-SEF 
working discussions at an early date. It sent several letters 
to the SEF in hopes of bringing about a fact-finding tour to 
Taiwan by Mainland economic and trade circles. It put forth -- 
at the first working discussion on implementing the general 
agreement of the "Wang-Gu talks" -- a "schedule of discussions" 
that called for an exchange of views or comprehensive 
negotiations on all topics -- including economic exchanges -- 
covered in the general agreement. Moreover, the Mainland has 
also taken positive steps to advance cross-strait exchanges in 
the fields of economics, trade, and science and technology. It 
has also responded positively to Taiwan's concern over 
legislative protection for the rights and interests of Taiwan 
investors in the Mainland. Thanks to the ARATS's active work 
with relevant authorities, a draft of the "Law on Protecting the 
Investments of Taiwan Compatriots" has been submitted to the 
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for 
deliberation. 
  It is the wish not only of the ARATS but also the business 
circles on Taiwan that issues related to the economy and science 
and technology are placed on the agenda of ARATS-SEF working 
discussions. In early December last year, the first meeting of 
the second board of directors and supervisor of the SEF adopted 
a motion by Wang Youzeng [Wang Yu-tseng], a director of the SEF 
and executive chairman of the Taiwan Business Federation, 
recommending that the "Mainland Affairs Council" "lift the ban 
to make it possible for leading Mainland industrialists and 
businessmen to visit Taiwan." In January this year, SEF 
Chairman Gu Zhenfu [Ku Chen-fu] said in answering a reporter's 
question that cross-strait economic exchanges and trade is 
extremely important; it cannot continue to be clouded with 
uncertainties. Authorities must formulate specific policies for 
Taiwan's business circles to follow. Exchange of high-level 
visits between economic and trade circles across the strait is 
also very important. This year should see, at the least, the 
start of such exchanges. Taiwan's KUNG SHANG SHIH PAO 
[COMMERCIAL TIMES] also published an article the other day 
urging authorities to lift restrictions on visits to Taiwan by 
Mainland industrialists and businessmen at an early date. 
  The reality of cross-strait economic exchanges and trade 
over 
the last decade or so shows that both sides will benefit 
economically by complementing each other's strengths. Moreover, 
the earlier such cooperation starts, the greater the benefits 
for both sides. The Taiwan authorities realized early on that 
"only by having the Mainland as its hinterland will Taiwan be 
able to solve its current and future economic difficulties." 
Due, however, to political considerations and man-made factors, 
development of cross-strait economic exchanges and trade has 
been placed under considerable restrictions. The "Wang-Gu 
talks" have removed a psychological barrier enabling both sides 
to eschew divergent views on politics [bi kai zheng zhi shang di 
qi jian 6699 7030 2398 3112 0006 4104 2978 6015] and develop 
economic cooperation through negotiations on routine affairs. 
It is therefore rather urgent for the two sides to study ways 
to comprehensively implement the agreement and place -- as early 
as possible -- economic issues on the agenda of the follow-up 
talks. Increasing mutual understanding through talks will help 
facilitate formulation of specific measures and plans for 
advancing cross-strait economic exchanges and cooperation and 
effectively pushing forward cross-strait economic, scientific, 
and technological exchanges, thereby ushering in a situation in 
which both sides will emerge as winners.

<F P=106> [Interview with Wu Bangguo, member of the Political Bureau </F>
of the CPC Central Committee and Secretary of the Shanghai 
Municipal CPC Committee, by Tseng Tak-sing, chief editor of TA 
KUNG PAO, in Shanghai on 14 January: "`Full Text' of Wu 
Bangguo's Exclusive Interview With TA KUNG PAO Chief Editor" -- 
first paragraph is TA KUNG PAO introduction] 
  [Text] Shanghai, 14 Jan (TA KUNG PAO) -- Wu Bangguo, 
member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and 
Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee, gave an 
interview to Tseng Tak-sing, chief editor of TA KUNG PAO here 
this afternoon. The full text of the questions and answers are 
as follows: 
  [Tseng Tak-sing] Secretary Wu Bangguo, Shanghai has 
developed rapidly in the past few years and has attracted much 
attention from China, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and the world as 
a whole. Please tell us something about how Shanghai's leap 
forward has been brought about. What is the significance of such 
a leap in the reform and opening up of China? 
  [Wu Bangguo] There are two aspects in the background of 
Shanghai's development. Shanghai was the center of China in the 
thirties and was called the "Paris of the Orient." At that 
time, Shanghai's economy was much more prosperous than that in 
Hong Kong. Since liberation in 1949, Shanghai has made 
relatively rapid development and relatively big contributions to 
the country. Two most outstanding aspects of contribution are 
given below. One is its monetary contribution to the state. 
When Hu Yaobang was the General Secretary and visited Shanghai 
in 1986, Jiang Zemin was the Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal 
CPC Committee. Hu Yaobang made a calculation together with 
Jiang Zemin and found that Shanghai had handed over 440 billion 
yuan to the state from liberation to 1986. The second major 
contribution is that it provided the whole country with large 
quantities of commodities. In those days, we practiced the 
planned economy, and Shanghai's commodities accounted for 40 
percent of the volume allocated according to the national plan. 
Commodities made in Shanghai were found everywhere across the 
country. Of course, Shanghai also made contributions in other 
aspects. 
<H5>  Two Aspects of the Background for Development </H5>
  In addition, Shanghai is a large central city. Because of 
historical reasons, Shanghai's functions as a central city have 
decreased. This is mainly expressed in two aspects. One is that 
Shanghai's industrial structure is not rational and the 
outstanding issue is that its tertiary industry is relatively 
weak. I came to work in the municipality in the beginning of 
1983 and at that time, the tertiary industry accounted for about 
20 percent of the economy of the municipality. The second 
outstanding issue is that the urban infrastructure is very 
backward. These issues have restricted Shanghai's economic 
development and have restricted its role as a central city. 
  Another aspect of the background is that by the nineties we 
have gained 10 years' experience in reform and opening up to the 
outside world. In 1990 Comrade Deng Xiaoping put forward that 
Shanghai was a trump card of ours and should be regarded as our 
shortcut. Comrade Deng Xiaoping explicitly put forward in 1991 
that Shanghai should develop Pudong. He said that opening up 
Pudong was required for Shanghai's own development, and was also 
required for the development of the Chang Jiang valley. In 
April 1991 Li Peng came to Shanghai and announced to the whole 
world on behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State 
Council that the central authorities had decided to carry out 
reform in Pudong and to open it to the outside world. The 14th 
CPC National Congress held in 1992 clearly put forward that the 
meaning of "a dragon head, and three centers." This meant that 
we regarded Shanghai as the dragon head of the Chang Jiang 
valley and the Chang Jiang delta which gave impetus to the 
development of the Chang Jiang valley and that we should 
gradually build Shanghai into an international economic, 
financial, and trade center. 
  The Chang Jiang valley includes seven provinces and one 
municipality, and it spreads over 1.8 million square kilometers. 
It has a population of 300 million people and the GNP of its 
entire national economy amounts to 1 trillion yuan. It is a 
relatively more developed region in China in terms of economy. 
The development of the economy of this region means the growth 
of China's economy. The success of reform in this region and the 
establishment of the operational mechanism of its socialist 
market economy means the success of China's reform. The opening 
of this region to the outside world means the opening of all of 
China to the outside world. 
<H3>  The Establishment of a Collection and Distribution Center of 
Five "Flows" </H3>
  [Tseng] Shanghai is to be "the dragon head and three 
centers" (economic, financial, and trade centers) of the Chang 
Jiang valley and even of the world. This is a grand ideal. How 
can this be concretely realized? 
  [Wu] What is the meaning of "one dragon head and three 
centers?" This is a question being discussed. I think Mayor 
Huang Ju's view in his speech is more accurate. He put forward 
the five "flows," that is, to build Shanghai into the collecting 
and distributing center of five "flows": The commodity flow, 
the capital flow, the technology flow, the personnel flow, and 
the information flow. In this way Shanghai's position as a 
center can be established. To make it simpler, it means to turn 
Shanghai into a collection and distribution center of 
commodities and a collection and distribution center of 
production essentials, and at the same time to build Shanghai 
into a converging point between the Chang Jiang valley and delta 
on the one hand and the world economy on the other. 
  In accordance with the needs of such development, we have 
put 
forward three points to be stressed in the development. First 
is to make great efforts to develop urban infrastructure. Many 
friends from Hong Kong find that Shanghai has changed, mainly in 
urban infrastructure. Others find it inconvenient to live here 
because of the poor urban infrastructure. Therefore, we have 
spent a lot of money on the construction of infrastructure, 
including two large bridges, the Yanggao road, power facilities, 
wharves, and the airport. 
  The second point to be stressed in the development is to 
make 
great efforts to develop tertiary industry. Tertiary industry 
has developed rapidly in Shanghai. In 1993 it accounted for 38 
percent of the whole economy of the municipality. Our target is 
to develop it to 45 percent by the end of this century. At 
present, it appears that this can be accomplished earlier, and 
by the end of this century it can reach 50 percent. The 
outstanding focus of tertiary industry is the market for 
production essentials, including the stock exchange, the futures 
market, the metals exchange, and the foreign exchange market, 
which is to open in January, and also including the technology 
market and the personnel market. 
  The third point to be stressed in the development is to 
develop high technology and new technology. Shanghai has the 
foundation for this. Its industry can be upgraded and some 
capital-intensive and technology-intensive industries can be 
developed. This can give better play to Shanghai's strong 
points. Technology and capable personnel are Shanghai's strong 
points. We should use high technology and new technology to 
transform our traditional industries. 
  What shall we do then? As a matter of fact, we have been 
carrying out such an operation for several years. We have paid 
more attention to four questions. The first is to push 
enterprises toward the market. In the planned economy, economic 
enterprises are a department of the government and the 
government undertakes unlimited responsibility for enterprises. 
This will not do and enterprises must move into the market. 
Once enterprises are enlivened, the entire economy will become 
enlivened. We have done a lot of work in this respect. The 
most important thing is to "provide water for breeding fish." 
In the past, the burden of enterprises was too heavy. The 
state took care of everything for enterprises and enterprises 
took care of everything for the society. This will not do and 
the government must be separated from enterprises. 
  The second is to give enterprises the decisionmaking power, 
such as the power to make decisions on wages, the use of 
personnel, and planning. However, there should also be 
restrictions. For example, on the wage issue, the growth in 
wages of enterprises should be less than the growth in taxes 
collected from enterprises, and the per capita growth in wages 
should be less than the growth of labor productivity. We are 
also considering linking value adding with value maintaining of 
the assets of enterprises. Under such circumstances, 
distribution within enterprises is enterprises' own business. 
They can establish their wage system. At present we are making 
further efforts in this respect. As for what was put forward at 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, in 
the past we did more work on production operation and 
management, and in the future we should gradually shift our work 
to the management of assets. In this way it will be possible to 
form an environment for market competition and the fittest will 
survive. At present, large and medium-sized enterprises are 
more flexible, but small enterprises are not good. A few large 
and medium-sized enterprises are not good either, but on the 
whole they are good. Why do small enterprises have so many 
difficulties? There are historical reasons for this. In the 
past, every bit of space was used and factories were set up in 
the city where residents were in great number. Those factories 
do not have the required conditions and the land prices of those 
factories are high. The number of small enterprises is great, 
but in terms of money, the volume of their losses are not big 
because they are small enterprises after all. Losses of large 
enterprises would be difficult to deal with. The 13th CPC 
National Congress put forward that the reform of enterprises was 
the starting point and foothold of our entire economic reform. 
<H5>  The World's Third Biggest Metal Trading Market </H5>
  The third question is to energetically nurture and develop 
the market in combination with the development of tertiary 
industry. A very big change in Shanghai in the past few years 
has been the nurturing and development of the market of 
Shanghai. In 1993 the volume of stock exchanges reached 500 
billion yuan, the volume had increased at a speed of five to six 
times a year, and the volume increased by six times last year, 
which was much faster than we had expected. In addition, our 
metals exchange has been set up for slightly more one year now. 
Last year the volume of exchange reached more than 350 billion 
yuan and the metals exchange became the world's third biggest. 
Moreover, the volume of exchange was close to the world's 
second biggest. The grain and edible oil exchange is operating 
on a trial basis and its daily exchange volume has reached 400, 
500, or 600 million yuan. In addition, there are also other 
commodity markets. We have set up many shops, for example: 
Taiwan's Pacific Department Store, which has recently opened at 
Xujiahui, the Isetan Company at Huaihai Road, and the Shui Hing 
Department Store. The annual volume of retail sales of 
commodities in Shanghai last year was 35 percent over the 
previous year. 
  The fourth question is to change government functions. What 
should be administered by the government should be administered 
by the government and what should not be administered by the 
government should be managed by the society, for example: The 
establishment of the social security system, insurance funds for 
unemployment, and medical insurance. Of course, there is also 
the question of changing concepts in medical insurance. Such 
insurance is not unlimited, but is only basic insurance because 
our country is still a developing country. In the past one 
drawback of our planned economy was a high-degree of 
concentration of power. In addition, its exclusiveness was very 
strong. A very clear characteristic at present is that 
Shanghai's role as an industrial base is developing to a higher 
level. The development of technology-intensive industries is 
faster than that of the labor-intensive industries, and the 
labor-intensive industries are moving toward the hinterland. 
  Shanghai has put forward the establishment of the socialist 
market economy operational mechanism before others. This has 
attracted the attention of some localities. This is because we 
hold that the establishment of the socialist market economy 
structure cannot be determined by Shanghai alone. The whole 
country is a big market and only when the socialist market 
economy structure is established across the country can there be 
a socialist market economy structure in Shanghai. 
  [Tseng] Shanghai has made outstanding achievements in 
economic construction. Is there any plan for the building of 
spiritual civilization? 
  [Wu] We are quite conscious of the building of spiritual 
civilization. As the economy develops, common practices should 
not become worse. With the development of the economy, the 
quality of human culture should also be raised. This is also the 
demand of common people. 
  We should find carriers for the building of spiritual 
civilization. Last year, all residents of the municipality were 
concerned with the East Asian Games. Originally, we were ready 
to carry out the games on a small scale. Later, as the games 
were linked with the application for hosting the Olympic Games, 
we were prepared to carry out the games on a large scale. The 
opening ceremony, in particular, should manifest our capacity 
for hosting the Olympic Games. I remember that the period from 
making the decision to opening the games was only 100 days. 
Everything was ready in 100 days. What was the reason for 
that? This was because everybody participated in the work and 
everybody became the host. Everybody worked to improve the 
cultural and sanitary environment of the municipality. This was 
precisely the building of spiritual civilization. According to 
our experience, we have found that one of the important things 
in the building of spiritual civilization is the participation 
of the masses and the integration with the desires of the 
masses. However, many problems exist. For example, JIEFANG 
RIBAO carried on the front page the day before yesterday a 
letter to me from the vice president of a U.S. corporation which 
mentioned unpleasant things he met with in Shanghai. For 
example, a decently dressed page boy at the door of a big 
restaurant used foul language. Another example was that some 
personnel of a hospital smoked despite signs forbidding people 
not to do so. He said that foreign enterprises paid much 
attention to their images and had integrated education with 
management. I have passed on this letter to people in charge of 
departments concerned and have urged propaganda departments to 
start work in this respect at the lowest level and proceeding 
from improving the images of enterprises. 
<H5>  No Horse Racing Course or Casinos </H5>
  [Tseng] Public places of entertainment have sprung up like 
bamboo shoots after a spring rain in the past few years. How 
are they managed? Some people are worried that while these 
public places of entertainment are enriching the cultural 
recreation of the residents, tourists, and foreign businessmen, 
they will do harm to the common practices of society. What do 
you think of this? Will the ban on gambling and betting on 
horse racing be lifted? 
  [Wu] At present, there are over 3,700 public places of 
entertainment in Shanghai. Shops on Nanjing Road and Huaihai 
Road are open up to 10 o'clock in the evening. Some restaurants 
and public places of entertainment are open up to 12 o'clock and 
others are open throughout the night. There are more than 600 
ballrooms and 500 karaoke bars. Besides, there are music 
teahouses and public places of sports. These public places of 
entertainment developed very fast last year and this is a kind 
of necessity for improving the people's life. We cannot just 
keep the people at home. It will not do to have television 
alone and the people, young people in particular, need other 
activities. Without such a demand, the market cannot develop 
either. Foreigners also find life in Shanghai more comfortable. 
This is also a necessity. Some things are banned in Shanghai 
because we hold ourselves responsible to foreigners and to the 
13 million people in Shanghai and we do not permit damage done 
to common social practices in Shanghai. In the past, Shanghai 
was the paradise of adventurers and a metropolis infested with 
foreign adventurers. Everything, good or bad, could be found 
here. Many teleplays and films of Hong Kong reflect these 
problems, including the underworld, kidnapping, and 
prostitution. We do not permit dying embers to glow again. We 
energetically develop healthy and positive things and at 
present, we still cannot have things like a horse racing 
courses, casinos, or betting companies. Some friends in Hong 
Kong and Macao have written with a good intention to me telling 
me the merits of those things. However, we have, after 
consideration, decided not to have such things. We cannot have 
girls accompanying customers in drinking and other activities. 
We cannot have pornography in any disguise. We cannot have 
beauty pageants either. I understand that many cities of 
foreign countries also have similar rules. Some countries, 
including capitalist countries, do not allow to beauty pageants. 
Because Shanghai was infested with foreign adventurers in the 
past, we will find it difficult to deal with them if they 
develop as a result of inappropriate management. For example, 
those who maintain order in casinos are actually hired ruffians. 
They would form an underworld, then corrupt our judicial 
departments turning policemen and bandits into one family, and 
it would be impossible to stop them. Foreign businessmen have 
also agreed to our acting in this way. Many Hong Kong friends, 
including wives of people in Hong Kong, have told me that this 
rule is good. The general principle is positive and 
progressive. The cultural market should not be turned into a 
pornography market under disguise, or a place for illegal 
activities. Shanghai has sternly cracked down on such things. 
The common people have given us great support. We have adhered 
to two directions. One is to make the cultural market 
prosperous and the other is to sternly crack down on illegal 
activities. 
  [Tseng] In the past, Shanghai was also the cultural center 
of China. Many first-rate artists of China began their careers 
here. However, in recent years the refined arts in Shanghai have 
met with much difficulty in their development. Please tell us 
how you will promote the development of refined arts in the new 
year. 
  [Wu] Regarding the question of refined arts, my 
understanding is that it is necessary to have both popular arts 
and refined arts. Our life is rich and colorful and we cannot 
have just one color. For example, during the Cultural 
Revolution, there were only eight model plays on modern themes. 
Some people said that the mainland would lower the intensity of 
performances given by singers from Hong Kong and Taiwan and they 
opposed allowing singers from Hong Kong and Taiwan to perform in 
Shanghai. Our attitude is that we welcome them. Wherever there 
is an audience, there is a market. However, we do not favor 
using public funds to raise the temperature of such 
performances. We have attached great importance to popular 
literature and art. We welcome performances given in Shanghai 
by singers from Hong Kong and Taiwan. We shall also give 
enthusiastic support to refined arts. 
  While watching an opera, I thought that Shanghai should have 
ballet. Shanghai regards economy as the center, but it should 
also have culture. We should not turn two legs into one. An 
outstanding question is the question of funds. More than 9,000 
performances were given in Shanghai last year. The government 
spent 2.5 million yuan on giving support to seven opera troupes. 
In addition to spending 40 million yuan on giving support to 
cultural undertakings each year, 2.5 million was specially 
allocated for the same purpose. Besides the question of funds, 
there is also the question of cultural facilities. A first-rate 
large opera house is being built at the People's Square. There 
is also the question of mechanism of the opera troupes 
themselves. We cannot eat "out of the same pot," nor can we 
practice egalitarianism. There is a question of the reform of 
the mechanism and there is great potential. The third aspect is 
the support of enterprises. The Baoshan Iron and Steel Company 
has donated 10 million yuan as funds for refined arts. The 
ballet troupe wants to adapt Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai for 
ballet and to perform Swan Lake, Don Quixote, the Nutcracker, 
and Romeo and Juliet. Ten performances of the Kun opera Peony 
Pavilion were given and the tickets sold very well. University 
students are also interested in opera. It is matter of 
fostering an interest. The orchestra went to Taiwan to give a 
performance. Many people watched its performance and it was 
well-received. 
  [Tseng] When Zhu Rongji was the mayor of Shanghai he visited 
Hong Kong and stressed Shanghai and Hong Kong should cooperate 
with and supplement each other. At present, the Sino-British 
talks on Hong Kong's constitutional system have broken down. 
How does Shanghai look at its relations with Hong Kong? 
  [Wu] The economy of Hong Kong and that of the mainland are 
getting closer and closer and they are on the same boat. On the 
part of Shanghai, it earnestly hopes to see a prosperous Hong 
Kong and Hong Kong's prosperity is beneficial to Shanghai. A 
lot of our funds have come via Hong Kong and much of our trade 
uses Hong Kong as an entrepot. We keep contact with the outside 
world through Hong Kong in terms of information and channels. 
Therefore, we hope very much to have a prosperous Hong Kong. 
At present, China, including Shanghai, has the ability of 
maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity. The development of 
Shanghai's economy is conducive to Hong Kong's prosperity and 
Hong Kong's prosperity can also promote Shanghai's development. 
There may be some competition, but competition is not something 
bad and competition can promote development. The drawback of 
the past economic structure is that it has no competition. No 
matter whether China and Britain will cooperate, Shanghai and 
Hong Kong must cooperate. A lot of Shanghai's interests are in 
Hong Kong. We believe the residents of Hong Kong are able to 
make development. Sooner or later, Shanghai will become a world 
economic center. We are confident that it will become one of 
the world's economic centers. 
<H5>  Energetically Support the Tax Sharing System </H5>
  [Tseng] The tax sharing system implemented by the state 
involves the readjustment of interests. The relationship 
between the center and the localities is a question which 
overseas people are much concerned about. What is Shanghai's 
attitude toward this question? 
  [Wu] We are all concerned about this question. For some 
time many overseas people were also concerned about it. This is 
mainly a matter of the distribution system. Zhu Rongji brought 
more than 60 people to Shanghai. We gave enthusiastic support 
to the tax sharing system. Mayor Huang Ju was studying in 
Beijing and we, on behalf of the Shanghai Municipal CPC 
Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Government, expressed our 
attitude. Shanghai had nothing different to say about the tax 
sharing system. Besides, we hope that the central authorities 
can strengthen macroregulation and control. If the central 
authorities lack the ability to carry out macroregulation and 
control, there will be an adverse impact on Shanghai. We, for 
example, have received many foreigners. They said they were not 
afraid of a high foreign exchange rate or a devaluation of the 
renminbi, but they were afraid of changes on our part. The 
highest exchange rate at one time was $1 to 11 yuan in Shanghai 
and the rate was going up. The foreigners were worried: You and 
I have run a joint venture. I have injected U.S. dollars into 
it, while you have injected renminbi. How should the percentage 
of funds for the joint venture be calculated. This is not a 
kind of cooperation. Therefore, we hope there can be 
macroregulation and control, which is the need of comprehensive 
development and also the need of Shanghai's development. State 
taxation rates, foreign exchange rates, and tariff rates should 
be highly unified. 
  Shanghai has resolutely implemented policies formulated by 
the central authorities and has persisted in making greater 
contribution to the state each year. We had harmonious talks 
with the central authorities last time. In his concluding 
remarks, Comrade Zhu Rongji said both sides were satisfied and 
could make clear explanation. The central authorities were 
satisfied and Shanghai was satisfied; clear explanation could be 
given to the people of the whole country and to the people of 
Shanghai. 
  At the central work meeting, Comrade Huang Ju, on behalf of 
the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee and Government, pledged 
three things. The first was to guarantee the establishment of a 
socialist market. The second was to guarantee the fulfillment 
of the task of handing over money to the state. Last year 
Shanghai handed over to the central authorities 30 billion yuan. 
The third was to guarantee the fulfillment of all the tasks 
assigned by the state to Shanghai and its subordination to the 
state's macroregulation and control. Shanghai is the Shanghai of 
the whole country. It has no raw materials. Nor has it energy 
sources. Shanghai's market is only confined to 13 million 
people. Shanghai's development cannot be separated from the 
whole country. If the whole country is good, Shanghai is good. 
If the whole country is not good, Shanghai cannot be good. We 
wholeheartedly support state policies. Comrade Jiang 
  Zemin also praised Shanghai for always taking the interests 
of the whole into account. As a matter of fact, the interests 
of the whole also conform with the needs of Shanghai's 
development. Recently, we held a plenary meeting of the 
municipal committee at which the question of the sense of the 
situation of the whole was put forward. Some articles published 
abroad have exaggerated things. I think the relationship 
between Shanghai and the central authorities is normal. We have 
never found that the central authorities do not give support to 
Shanghai or that Shanghai does not subordinate itself to central 
leadership. 
  [Tseng] Is there a concrete timetable for Shanghai to 
develop to a financial center? 
  [Wu] In recent years, the progress of Shanghai's formation 
as a financial center has been faster than expected. Several 
major financial markets in Shanghai, the currency market, the 
bills and security discount market, and the foreign exchange 
market, have developed rapidly. Foreign banks have set up 
offices in Shanghai and the U.S. Citibank has moved its Asian 
Headquarters from Hong Kong to Shanghai. In addition, we have 
adopted a major measure this year. 
  In the past, banks and financial companies were located in a 
concentrated manner in areas around the Shanghai Bund. The 
Shanghai Municipal Government has put forward a plan on the 
establishment of a real estate exchange center and on building a 
Chinese Wall Street around the Shanghai Bund. 
  I do not have much contact with foreign banks in Shanghai 
and 
I feel that they still seem to be able to make profits. 
Although they still cannot manage the renminbi business at 
present, they can do business with the foreign-invested 
enterprises. At present, 3,000 new foreign-invested enterprises 
are opened in Shanghai each year. With such a speed in 
construction, the volume of the flow of funds is very great. 
Last year, Shanghai introduced over $7 billion of foreign 
capital. Besides, Shanghai is actively exploring financial 
reform. For example, Shanghai has most favorable conditions for 
running commercial banks first. At present, the development is 
faster than what was expected. Shanghai has more than 20 
foreign banks, including financial companies. 
  The site of the municipal government was formerly the 
Shanghai and Hong Kong Banking Corporation Building. The 
municipal government will take the lead in moving out of the 
building. At present, several foreign banks or offices of 
foreign banks have shown great interest in the building. At 
present, most foreign banks or offices of foreign banks are 
located in hotels or other office buildings and they are not 
easy to find. We are going to move government organs out of 
areas around the Shanghai Bund and to let banks and financial 
undertakings develop their business there. 
  [Tseng] The real estate business, after a period of heated 
development, has cooled down and many people have taken a wait 
and see attitude. Is there any problem in this respect? 
<H5>  Rapid Sales of Villas in Close Suburban Areas </H5>
  [Wu] The real estate business should develop along a correct 
line. Because of this, we have made some rules and regulations. 
For example, we have fixed a limit for the lowest price of real 
estate; we have stipulated that land is given in accordance with 
relevant projects and this can prevent profiteering; and we have 
stipulated that funds for land development should be available 
as scheduled or the land will be taken back. 
  At present, there are relatively heated sales of real 
estate in Shanghai. After tax reform, the collection of real 
estate profit taxes has met with some problems. Some people are 
frightened and want to sell their houses. We think that the 
taxation system should not restrict the development of the real 
estate business. In Shanghai, land prices are high and the rate 
of return from investment is low. We should properly study how 
to fix local taxes. At present, sales of garden villas in 
Shanghai's close suburbs, such as those in the Hongqiao 
Development Zone, remain heated. Because Shanghai approves the 
establishment of over 3,000 new foreign-invested enterprises 
each year, the number of offices of foreign enterprises will 
become even more. They are located in hotels and the rents 
there are very expensive. They all want to buy villas in close 
suburbs. Of course, the market for inexpensive houses is the 
biggest. Residents whose houses have to be pulled down have a 
great demand for inexpensive houses and the municipal government 
has also encouraged to build more such houses. Shanghai's land 
prices were high even in the past. We should make use of the 
strong point of the price difference in downtown areas. On the 
other hand, the development of Pudong should make use of the 
strong point of low land prices. At present, quite a few large 
enterprises abroad are optimistic about the real estate business 
in Shanghai. A major Hong Kong real estate businessman told me: 
"The true real estate business is in Shanghai. Shanghai is a 
big city. To make money, we must come to Shanghai." 
  [Tseng] What has Shanghai done in opposing corruption and 
encouraging honesty? 
  [Wu] We have grasped anticorruption not because corruption 
is very serious. We cannot wait until corruption is very 
serious. The social order is stable in Shanghai. For example, 
there has been no problem in the control over guns in the past 
10 years. We also have to be realistic in grasping the building 
of clean administration. For example, regarding the issue of not 
allowing party or government organs to run tertiary industry, we 
have stipulated that party, government, or judicial organs shall 
not run special businesses, such as karaoke bars; that party or 
government organs shall not speculate in stocks or futures, 
because if they were allowed to do so, they could use inside 
information; and that party or government organs shall not 
practice monopolistic management and shall not contract tertiary 
businesses out to private businessmen so as to avoid damaging 
the image of party or government organs. At the same time, we 
have also asked cadres to exercise self-discipline and to 
consciously do a good job in the building of clean 
administration. We were able to implement these few things last 
year.

<F P=106> [By Zheng Zhong (6774 6850): "A Great Idea, a Great </F>
Approach, a Great Job --An Interview With Wu Bangguo, a member 
of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and 
secretary of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee"; place and 
date not given; first three paragraphs are WEN HUI BAO 
introduction] 
  [Text] People tend to analogize Shanghai to a sea and have 
various conjectures about and understandings of it. 
  If Shanghai were an actual sea, it was Comrade Xiaoping's 
remarks made during his tour to the south that -- like the 
eastern wind -- make this sea look so magnificent. It is as 
described by the Han dynasty's Mu Hua [2606 5478] in his "Hai 
Fu" [Prose on the Sea]: "Raising the hundred-foot sail in 
anticipating the gusty winds; vast and boundless, the sky is the 
Limit; it may be calm and unruffled, it may be stormy and 
tumultuous with waves reaching the sky and suddenly down and 
gone. Yet, it is the meeting place of hundreds of slow-flowing 
rivers that help clear away garbage while they flow. It is the 
broadness, bizarreness, and greatness that count." 
  It is precisely with this "Hai Fu" that this reporter begins 
his interview with Wu Bangguo, a member of the Political Bureau 
of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of the Shanghai 
Municipal CPC Committee, on Shanghai's economic situation. 
<H3>  Topic of Conversation One: What Mode of Thinking Has 
Shanghai Adopted in Its Operations? </H3>
  [Wu Bangguo] You are talking about literary works and cite 
Mu 
Hua's imaginative descriptions of the great sea. I have to rely 
on reality. Let me tell you something about Shanghai's actual 
situation. For the past few years, Shanghai's main task has 
been the identification of thinking on development. The central 
authorities' demand for Shanghai has been the "development and 
opening of the Pudong area of Shanghai and making Shanghai one 
of the world's economic, financial, and trade centers," under 
which Pudong has been clearly designated as the focus of 
nationwide reform and opening up in the nineties. In meeting 
this demand over several terms of office, the Shanghai municipal 
party committee and the municipal government, after carrying out 
numerous investigations, studies, and examinations and taking 
local realities into consideration, have identified the goals 
and strategic focus of development in Shanghai. I would like to 
elaborate on them in a relatively popular way: 
  The first goal is an average of 10-percent annual growth in 
terms of the gross national product [GNP] to maintain sustained, 
rapid, and healthy economic development in Shanghai. 
  The second goal is the adjustment of the industrial 
structure 
and industries' internal setup. We are not only interested in 
speed, but speed with high efficiency. Because of historical 
factors, Shanghai has been concentrating highly on industry, 
leaving thus behind a very weak tertiary industry. In terms of 
development, it will be difficult to bring into full play the 
function of a city without a well-developed tertiary industry. 
That is why we emphasize developing tertiary industry and, 
derived from this very thinking, commit ourselves heavily to the 
ongoing development of the various markets, transportation, 
wharfs, and communications. As for adjusting industries' 
internal setup, we have been promoting the growth of such new 
industries as sedan cars, communications, machine building, and 
electronics as a whole, power stations, bioengineering, and 
petrochemicals. With this move and by highlighting our special 
strengths and avoiding our weak points, we should be able to 
develop a unique industrial structure in Shanghai without 
repeating the patterns of other cities. We should strive to 
complete the adjustment exercise for both the industrial 
structure and industries' internal setup by the close of the 
century -- not only an adaptive adjustment, but a strategic and 
fundamental one. This is crucial to speedy and better economic 
development in Shanghai. 
  It is only through these adjustments that we will be able to 
truly achieve technological progress, enhance the people's 
quality of life, and bring out Shanghai's superiority. 
  The third goal is the shaping of a new Shanghai in Pudong -- 
bounded by the area opposite the Bund and to the east of the 
Huangpu Jiang -- capable of meeting the challenges of the next 
century. 
  The fourth goal is eliminating the current 800,000 night 
stools and 800,000 briquette stoves and the basic solution of 
related problems -- including transportation and housing, which 
have been left over by history -- by the end of the century. 
Our targets are that by then, the per capita housing space for 
Shanghai residents -- both urban and suburban -- will reach 10 
square meters, with more than 70 percent of housing units having 
their own bathrooms and kitchens. Besides, we have more 
concrete goals. 
  [Zheng Zhong] What kind of measures have you adopted to 
achieve these goals? 
  [Wu] What will be the main focus of our work, given these 
four goals? First, we must vigorously step up the building of 
the infrastructure, which is necessary to improve the people's 
living environment. It is not strange for people to complain if 
they have to endure crowded buses all the time. We must also 
improve the investment environment: telecommunications, power 
supply, wastewater treatment works, two major bridges, multilane 
tunnels, the inner and outer ring roads, several expressways 
linking Shanghai to other places, and the subway. All these 
cost big money, but we cannot do without them. Without a sound 
infrastructure, there will be no good investment environment; 
without a good investment environment, it will be difficult to 
get the funds for future construction. Today we cannot say we 
have provided the people of Shanghai with a superior 
environment, but at least their living environment has improved. 
We are all human beings. Who does not want to live a more 
comfortable life? The day has arrived for the people of 
Shanghai to live more comfortably. 
  Second, we must develop a number of large modern markets, 
focusing particularly on cultivating markets for essential 
factors of production. This not only requires that the 
marketplace covers a large area and that facilities be more 
advanced, but it also demands greater standardization, order, 
and efficiency. Shanghai needs to further improve its own 
financial and securities, nonferrous metal, oil, and other 
markets. It should gradually explore a spot- commodities 
exchange and a negotiable-instruments-futures exchange, and it 
should develop high-standard markets with advanced trading 
information. At the same time, under state guidance, it should 
step up the construction of foreign exchange, gold, and bonded 
capital goods markets and accelerate the cultivation and 
development of markets for specialized technical personnel, 
labor, real estate, scientific and technological research 
results, as well as information so as to turn Shanghai into a 
comprehensive, modernized market capable of reaching out to 
faraway places. 
  Third, we must develop in the direction of high and new 
technologies. This has a twofold purpose. One is to develop 
high- and new-technology industries, and the other is to apply 
high and new technologies to transform traditional processing 
technologies. I have been responsible for telecommunications. 
The contract on the program-controlled telephone switch system 
signed with Bell Laboratories covers the period up to 1995. 
Mobile telephones and cellular phones are all trend-setting 
things. We will also develop satellite communications. Without 
satellite communications, the development of financial and 
futures markets will be affected. Laser printers and fax 
machines are among the other things we want to develop. I have 
said that the telecommunications industry alone will generate 20 
billion to 30 billion yuan in output value by the year 2000. It 
seems now achieving this target will not be a problem. The 
telecommunications output was 800 million in 1991, it rose to 
3.2 billion by 1992, and it is expected to reach 6.5 billion in 
1993. This industry makes full use of Shanghai's favorable 
conditions in terms of its human resources, and it has great 
potential. Our mayor, Huang Ju, personally attends to the 
automobile industry. Shanghai's car production exceeded 100,000 
in 1993, and its capacity will reach 200,000 this year, with 82 
percent of the parts being manufactured domestically. Sales by 
the automobile industry topped 30 billion yuan last year. 
Deputy Secretary Chen Zhili is responsible for computers, Vice 
Mayor Xu Kuangdi is in charge of biological engineering, and 
Vice Mayor Jiang Yiren has control of the power industry. I 
believe that by the end of this century, a group of new backbone 
industries will take shape in Shanghai. 
  These are our three principal strategic points. There is a 
distinguishing feature of Shanghai's work: All the things that 
we promised have been done. So far, there have never been a 
single instance in which we did not accomplish on schedule what 
we said we would do. 
  [Zheng] Ideas are wealth. I believe that Shanghai has found 
a clear way to develop itself. 
  [Wu] That is right. Ideas mean wealth. I have the same 
opinion. Even if we do not have any money, we will think of 
ways to collect funds and succeed. Without the right ideas, we 
can accomplish nothing even if we have money in our hands. 
  [Zheng] When I worked as a reporter in other localities, 
people asked me whether Shanghai was performing magic. Formerly, 
it was like a "pauper" without any accomplishments at all. Now, 
it has become rich like an upstart, as if it had suddenly 
awakened from a slumber. 
  [Wu] Friends in other localities say that we are performing 
magic. Now I am going to tell you the truth. Some comrades do 
not understand Shanghai. We have two accounting books now. One 
is a financial accounts book. The finance bureau's accounts 
book is for subsistence. Frankly speaking, it is not enough to 
depend only on the funds of the financial accounts book, which 
are spent entirely on subsidies for grain, diesel oil, and 
public utilities. For example, electricity, communications and 
transportation, coal gas, and tap water need to be subsidized. 
We have a deficit every year. The other one is a construction 
accounts book, which relies mainly on loans. The first source 
is the direct introduction of foreign funds. We attracted 
foreign funds worth $5.3 billion from January to August 1993, 
and we shall strive to attract direct investment exceeding $50 
billion from foreign businessmen by the end of the century. The 
second source is borrowing money. Building the big bridge is 
funded by a loan from the Asian Development Bank, the 1.6 
billion yuan for building the confluence sewage treatment 
project is from a World Bank loan, and the subway project is 
funded by a German Government loan. We have to repay 780 
million yuan worth of foreign debt every year. At home, we 
incurred debts by obtaining loans from the People's Bank [of 
China] and by issuing stocks and bonds. The third source of 
income is leasing land. Land in Shanghai is very dear. Leasing 
rental space in Shanghai's downtown area generally costs about 
$500 per square meter; when calculated using a ratio of five, 
taking into account an average of five stories per building, 
leasing one square meter of floor space will then bring in 
$2,500. By leasing real estate space, we have raised 
considerable funds for renovating Shanghai's old areas and for 
building supporting infrastructure facilities. Funds now are 
the most important consideration for the Shanghai municipality's 
so-called macroeconomic control. We hold a meeting on managing 
funds once every week. What we have stimulated are the 
construction funds. If people say that we are performing magic, 
we are performing it with the funds until we enter a sound cycle 
of economic activities. 
<H3>  Topic Two of the Conversation: Shanghai's Reform at Its Own 
Expense and With the Initiative in Its Own Hands Under the 
Prerequisite of Three Guarantees </H3>
  [Zheng] History shaped Shanghai's role as a base of heavy 
industry. The development of a market economy gives Shanghai a 
sense of urgency. Large and medium state enterprises are more 
concentrated in Shanghai than in any other area. What are 
Shanghai's concept and implementation in this respect? 
  [Wu] At an economic work conference held by the central 
authorities on successfully running large and medium state 
enterprises, Comrade Huang Ju delivered a speech on behalf of 
the Shanghai municipal party committee and the Shanghai 
municipal government. He offered three guarantees to the CPC 
Central Committee and the State Council: 1) a guarantee of the 
orientation of socialism; 2) a guarantee that financial revenues 
to be turned over to the higher authorities will be paid in 
full; and 3) a guarantee of the fulfillment of the tasks 
assigned by the central authorities and a guarantee of 
Shanghai's subordination to macroeconomic regulation and 
control. He asked the central authorities to permit Shanghai to 
carry out reform at its own expense and with the initiative in 
its own hands under the prerequisites of these three guarantees. 
Because the market economy has been implemented, it is 
necessary to create an environment in which enterprises can 
compete fairly with each other. To achieve this goal, we have 
adopted three measures. First, to "balance the tax burden." 
The current major contradiction is an unequal tax burden. 
State-owned enterprises, which are overburdened with taxes, lost 
their competitiveness. Leading comrades of the central 
authorities have mentioned on many occasions the idea of giving 
in order to receive. The overall idea for transforming large 
and medium enterprises is "lowering tax rates and enlarging the 
tax base." Although tax rates are lowered, the state's tax 
revenue does not decrease because an enlarged tax base produces 
more revenue. Second, decisionmaking power for exports is given 
to enterprises, thus enabling them to conduct business in 
accordance with international practices, to participate in 
international economic cooperation and the international 
division of labor, and to tap into foreign raw materials, 
capital funds, and markets. This is necessary to push 
Shanghai's economy in a beneficial direction. Third, enterprises 
are given decisionmaking power in distribution, thus arousing 
the enthusiasm of enterprises' workers. We put forward the idea 
of directly linking wage increases to enterprises' economic 
performance. As a result, tax rates increase by 1 percent and 
wages increase by 0.7 percent. But the wage increase is lower 
than the increase in labor productivity. There is no longer a 
set limit for wage increases. Of course, the most fundamental 
key to invigorating state-owned large and medium enterprises 
lies in changing the operating mechanism. The issues of the 
modern enterprise system currently raised by comrades in 
theoretical circles are worthy of great attention. 
  [Zheng] Do localities have the power to reduce taxes? 
  [Wu] We do not have the power to reduce taxes. But Shanghai 
practices a contracted financial responsibility system. It is 
estimated that the revenue turned over to the state by Shanghai, 
which has an area of 6,100 square km, might reach 30 billion 
yuan this year, including 15 billion yuan from the Shanghai 
municipal government and 15 billion yuan from enterprises in 
Shanghai directly under the central authorities. The idea of 
carrying out reform at Shanghai's own expense means that under 
the prerequisite of pledging to accomplish the task of turning 
over a set amount of revenue to the central authorities, 
Shanghai will provide support for the development of some high- 
and new-technological industries in accordance with Shanghai's 
financial ability. Such industries include communications and 
computer industries, as mentioned above. Because Shanghai's 
financial ability is limited, the scope of tax reductions and 
exemptions is also limited. However, as far as supporting new 
pillar industries is concerned, this is of significant 
importance. 
  [Zheng] Is this an experiment on a selective basis or an 
experiment to be carried by all enterprises? What is the result 
of such an experiment? 
  [Wu] The "Regulations on Changing Operating Mechanisms in 
State-Owned Industrial Enterprises" stipulate that enterprises 
enjoy 14 kinds of decisionmaking power. We emphasize the three 
aforementioned points. I personally believe that they provide a 
fairly good objective environment for enterprises. Compared to 
the rest of the nation, Shanghai's state-owned enterprises are 
suffering the lowest financial losses. At present, Shanghai's 
large and medium enterprises are faring relatively well. Those 
which are faring poorly mainly are small enterprises. 
Therefore, I told foreign visitors that it is useless to 
discuss concepts alone. State-owned large and medium enterprises 
are not a bad idea. Shanghai's overall industrial growth rate is 
10 percent, and the growth rate of its large and medium 
enterprises is more than 16 percent. The growth of large and 
medium enterprises constitutes the main part of Shanghai's 
economic growth. As for the reform of state-owned large and 
medium enterprises, we began to try it out on a selective basis. 
In the beginning, we experimented with the reform with some 
enterprises whose products have a ready market and whose 
economic performance is good. A total of 54 large and medium 
enterprises carried out the experiment at that time. The reform 
turned out to be a success. Later, the scope of such an 
experiment is enlarged step by step. In the end, it will be 
carried out at all enterprises. 
  [Zheng] Can all enterprises be saved by such an experiment? 
As far as I know, some enterprises in Shanghai are heavily 
burdened with debts. They are on the brink of bankruptcy or are 
waiting to go bankrupt. 
  [Wu] You are right. Now I would like to discuss another 
idea: Those manageable large and medium enterprises should be 
allowed to prosper and those unmanageable ones whose debts are 
larger than their assets should be allowed to go bankrupt before 
they are reorganized. Some plants with only 20 million to 30 
million yuan in assets are burdened with more than 100 million 
yuan in debts. The debt interest for each plant totals 15 
million yuan per year. They were even not able to pay the 
interest. As a result, we replaced several plant managers. 
Some plant managers were so worried that their hair went gray. 
Who could handle the problem? It seems that bankruptcy is a 
solution worth trying. Some foreigners asked me what we should 
do if state-owned enterprises experience financial losses. I 
told them that under the structure of the planned economy, 
financial losses do not mean anything because the state will 
subsidize the losses. They criticized us by saying that we 
treated enterprises like a kind father. The market economy 
means permitting survival of the fittest on the basis of fair 
competition. Some enterprises are eliminated through 
competition, but more are reborn and grow bigger in the 
competition. But great resistance occurs when we try to let 
unmanageable enterprises go bankrupt. Having no other, better 
way, we adopt the method of mergers. More than 100 plants are 
merged each year. Raising returns through an economy of scale is 
achieved by merging plants whose products have a ready market 
and whose economic performance is good with plants waiting to go 
bankrupt. After the merger, the new plants become even more 
invigorated. This is also a good way to readjust the industrial 
structure. There is an iron- clad rule: If you do not let 
enterprises whose debts exceed their assets go bankrupt, they 
will not experience a rebirth. 
<H3>  Topic Three of the Conversation: How the Organizational 
Form of an Enterprise Meets the Requirements of the 
Modernization Drive </H3>
  [Zheng] During the course of reform carried out by 
enterprises, the organizational form of an enterprise is drawing 
increasing interest, and people in theoretical circles are 
raising the idea of modern enterprises. What is your opinion 
about this? 
  [Wu] The current organizational forms of enterprises are 
somewhat unable to meet the requirements of this stage of the 
market economy. To enable them to meet such requirements, 
enterprises should adopt the corporate system. Enterprises in 
all other market economy-type countries are either a company or 
a financial group. This mean that current enterprises should 
change their form. This is a complicated process which requires 
a good job be done in many fundamental tasks. I believe that 
such fundamental tasks should include the following: The key 
issue is property rights, which serve as the mainstay of the 
market economy. If the property rights are not clearly 
defined, they cannot become the mainstay. Government 
administration and enterprise management are separated in our 
current enterprises. The state bears unlimited responsibility 
for them. If they experience financial losses, whom will they 
turn to? Nobody except the state, who should bear the 
responsibility. Such a system will ruin enterprises. Therefore, 
it is necessary to compile an inventory and examine the 
stockpiles and capital of enterprises. Many enterprises do not 
know exactly what assets they possess or what portion is the 
state's capital funds and what portion is the enterprises' 
assets. Second, it is necessary to clarify accounts receivable 
and debts payable. As I just mentioned, if there exists an 
enterprise whose assets are only 20 million or 30 million yuan 
and whose debts exceed 100 million yuan, then we should let it 
go bankrupt because it does not have the capability of paying 
its debts. Now many enterprises have chaotic accounts. 
Although deeply in debt, they give more bonuses to workers than 
do other enterprises. In this way, the state's assets are 
frittered away little by little. Third, the accounting measures 
currently adopted by enterprises should be replaced by 
international ones. Enterprises now have more than 20 report 
forms, while Sino-foreign enterprises usually have only three, 
with which they are able to clearly show their business 
situation. Because of the incorrect accounting methods, the 
situation often occurs in which profits show up in the 
accounting statement despite losses being the actual situation. 
As for cost accounting, we do not share a common language with 
other investors living abroad because we have different opinions 
about what is to be considered a cost and what is not. I will 
not go into further detail about such problems as deducting the 
percentage of depreciation expenses and the expenses incurred in 
developing new products, as well as whether to list wages and 
bonuses as a cost. It will be very difficult to push 
enterprises onto the right track if they do not adopt the 
accounting method commonly used internationally. 
  [Zheng]: What would the large enterprise groups be like 
when the enterprise's external environment and internal 
structure are optimized and they have shifted to new tracks? 
Can you tell us your ideas for the future? 
  [Wu] There are two types of large enterprise conglomerates 
in 
the world. The Japanese type is trade oriented. The 
conglomerate is composed of many enterprises, and its trading 
companies are very active. South Korea also is included in this 
type. The other type is found mostly in the United States and 
Europe. They are industry-oriented large conglomerates. 
Germany's Siemens and the Netherlands' Phillips belong to this 
category. They are big translational industrial groups linked 
by assets. We are now considering merging Shanghai's four major 
energy concerns into an enterprise group. 
  [Zheng] Does this mean a thorough transformation in the 
enterprises' organizational form? 
  [Wu] Yes. I believe that enterprises' organizational forms 
should be diversified. First, there will be many limited 
liability companies and limited liability stock companies. 
Certainly, those companies whose shares are listed should be of 
a small number. Even in Japan, they account for only 2 to 3 
percent of the total. Then there are Sino-foreign joint 
ventures, Sino-foreign cooperative enterprises, and exclusively 
foreign-owned enterprises. More and more foreign-invested 
enterprises have emerged in Shanghai. I believe that we should 
be selective with regard to foreign-invested enterprises so that 
we can exchange access to our market for technology and 
accelerate China's modernization drive. The market is the 
driving force of economic growth; it is also our means for 
importing technology. We must not give away our capital for 
nothing. 
  [Zheng] You have spoken with me before about implementing 
the 
shareholding system in Shanghai's enterprises. I know that both 
you and Mayor Huang Ju are ardent supporters of this idea. Now 
we can see the results of this system. 
  [Wu] When Shanghai introduced for the first time the 
shareholding system in enterprises, it was an experiment. We 
only had some fuzzy ideas, not like the very clear ideas that we 
have today. Today, those shareholding enterprises in Shanghai 
are lively and energetic. They are growing faster than the rest 
of them and they are having the times of their lives. The four 
shareholding enterprises under the Shanghai Handicraft Industry 
Bureau account for 70 percent of the bureau's total economic 
returns. The seven shareholding enterprises under the Shanghai 
Textile Bureau account for 50 percent of the bureau's economic 
returns. The shareholding system's impact on enterprises is 
twofold: First, the injection of capital helps advance the 
enterprise's transformation and development, and second, it 
prompts them to transform their operating mechanisms in a 
down-to-earth manner. Shareholders' overseeing of an 
enterprise's operations has proved to be a very effective 
driving force. The enterprise is supposed to distribute 
dividends or allocate additional shares at the year's end. If 
its assets have not increased or it is unable to come up with 
the money to pay dividends, the shareholders will call the 
managers to account. The most important characteristic of the 
shareholding system is that it is highly transparent. It must 
publish its balance sheet once a year. You cannot fool today's 
shareholders. If there is a mistake in the balance sheet, they 
will jump on it and you will find yourself in a terrible fix. 
Therefore, the enterprise must improve its management and make 
public its liabilities, assets, and profit-to-sales ratio. 
Under these circumstances, enterprises will have to introduce 
standard management procedures. Shareholding enterprises with 
especially high economic returns may have their shares listed on 
the securities exchange. Listed enterprises have a 
responsibility to small investors. No one is allowed to 
willfully bring an enterprise to bankruptcy. We must protect 
the interests of investors. 
  [Zheng] You can feel Shanghai's prosperity everywhere you 
go. Can there be a bubble economy behind the facade of 
prosperity? 
  [Wu] I also thought about this concern of yours. I recently 
conducted a survey, which shows that in the first half of 1993, 
Shanghai's trade grew more than 38 percent, which was very good. 
The growth was attributed mainly to consumption by residents 
instead of institutions, which saw not much growth. This has 
set my mind at ease, because consumption by the general public 
is genuine. The ongoing macroeconomic control would have 
curbed institutional consumption if it had accounted for a 
greater proportion of the trade growth. This being the case, we 
are still closely regulating and controlling Shanghai's economy 
to prevent the development of a false, bubble economy. 
<H3>  Topic Four: The Formation of the Great Ideas and Their 
Impact on Shanghai's Development </H3>
  [Zheng] There is an ancient Chinese saying: "Sit in a 
command 
post to formulate strategies." Your command post is always 
empty; we have a hard time finding you. 
  [Wu] I like going down to the grass roots. Even though I may 
not necessarily conduct in-depth investigation, the more places 
I go to and the more things I hear, the broader my thoughts 
become. There are many talented people in various work posts who 
have brilliant ideas on running this municipality. These people 
are in no position to direct other people to do what they think 
is right, but we can absorb their ideas and use our position to 
put their ideas into practice. Strategies do not have to be 
developed in offices or meetings. (At this time, Wu Bangguo 
stood up from the sofa and walked to a map of Shanghai suburbs, 
which was filled with closely-drawn circles) I have visited 
every county in Shanghai suburbs and all the circled townships, 
towns, and villages on the map. The visits have given me more 
ideas, and I have a pretty good idea about developments in the 
rural areas. 
  [Zheng] You mentioned the question of pooling the wisdom of 
the masses. This reminds me of something I have pondered all 
the time: Shanghai has been making tremendous achievement based 
on great ideas. The great ideas are, I believe, the result of 
the efforts of the current municipal party and government 
leaders, who have not only carried forward the thinking of their 
predecessors but also enriched and developed them. I mentioned 
this in my interview with Wang Liping, Chen Liangyu, Xia 
Keqiang, and other leaders. They had the same feeling. 
  [Wu] This is an important point. Huang Ju and I have learned 
much from our predecessors during the 11 years of service here. 
As deputies, we took part in the formulation of Shanghai's 
major policy decisions and development blueprints. Many of the 
measures announced today were not formed overnight; they were 
the crystallization of the wisdom of past leaders. Comrades 
Zemin [Jiang Zemin] and Rongji [Zhu Rongji], in particular, 
dedicated their painstaking efforts and wisdom to lay down a 
strong work foundation. In the new situation, there will 
certainly be changes and development. However, we still pay 
attention to maintaining stability and continuity. 
  The great ideas you mentioned also incorporate another 
element: We have always upheld the building of spiritual 
civilization to maintain a fine social atmosphere. This was 
also the traditional thinking of Shanghai's past leadership. We 
must be responsible for our next generation. How can we live in 
a society where parents are always worried about their children 
away from home. We must safeguard social stability. We will 
not be able to accomplish anything in a turbulent society. 
Ordinary citizens will be the ultimate victims. The municipal 
party committee has decided to ban horse racing, bar girls, 
gambling, and beauty contests. Some people accused me of being 
on the left. Actually I am being responsible to the people. No 
one can control the situation once social atmosphere is 
corrupted. Things like that, if allowed to develop, will create 
an underworld, which will produce incurable maladies and exert 
corrosive effects on party and government organs. If society is 
in disorder and social atmosphere is corrupt, ordinary citizens 
will complain and curse you even if the economy is in good 
shape. A foreign businessman told me he was not afraid of 
carrying some money and walking on Shanghai's streets at night. 
Maintaining social stability is also a great idea. 
  [Zheng] How did the current leaders communicate with each 
other to arrive at a harmonious consensus? 
  [Wu] I mentioned before that I have worked with Huang Ju for 
11 years. I know what he thinks and he knows what I am 
thinking. We have taken concerted action without prior 
agreement. After working side by side for a long period, we 
have complete trust in each other. This is not only the case 
between the two of us, either. Among the leading bodies of the 
municipal party committee, the government, the people's congress 
standing committee, and the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference committee, it seems that everyone is 
able to speak freely with each other with an open mind. They 
deal with problems and do not concern themselves with 
personalities. They work with peace of mind and do not feel the 
need to guard against each other. They discuss issues without 
reservation. Good ideas are supported regardless of who comes 
up with them. Every so often we hold a meeting to exchange 
views. There are no predetermined subjects. Participants speak 
their minds, and sometimes they are able to come up with some 
good ideas. 
  [Zheng] Will there be new moves in Shanghai's future 
development? 
  [Wu] The specific ideas for development which were decided 
on 
at the sixth municipal party congress are the result of joint 
explorations by previous municipal party committees and 
governments, and they have been affirmed by the party Central 
Committee and the State Council, as well as by Deng Xiaoping and 
other revolutionaries of the older generation. The general 
framework will not change between now and the end of this 
century, but we are determined to broaden our path forward. 
  [Zheng] This has been a very pleasant interview. Thank you. 
  [Wu] You are very welcome. Please come again for a casual 
talk. 
  [Zheng] In the old days, I accompanied Comrade Wu Bangguo as 
a journalist in his tour of five provinces in southwestern 
China. At the time, it was called lateral association, which 
was part of the activities within the framework of a planned 
economy. Since then, I have become better acquainted with him 
and have learned more about him. We are able to talk for long 
hours at a time when we meet on occasion. I have often been 
moved by his humility and by his strict self-discipline. I 
often admire his original and penetrating views but have not had 
a chance to publish them in the press. This was because he 
asked me on those occasions to chat with him as a friend, not as 
a journalist doing an interview. On this particular occasion, I 
spoke with him about many problems related to Shanghai's 
development at the request of a Beijing magazine. Because some 
of the subjects discussed are rarely known about by the people, 
I have recorded the interview with Comrade Bangguo for the 
benefit of our readers. He has not reviewed the transcript. I 
wonder whether he will take offense.

  [Text] Shanghai, February 5 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai, China's 
largest port, exported 520 million U.S. dollars' worth of goods 
in January, up 18 percent over the same month in 1993, the 
municipal foreign trade department reported today. 
  An official of the department said that exports from 
Shanghai 
amounted to 7.38 billion U.S. dollars for the whole of 1993. 
The figure represented a nearly 13 percent rise over the year 
before, exceeding the nation's average growth rate for the first 
time in the previous 23 years. 
  The municipal government has decided to mobilize all 
economic 
sectors in Shanghai to expand exports, in a bid to spur the 
city's economic growth in the new year, he said. 
  The manufacturing industry plans to increase exports by at 
least 15 percent this year, he said. 
  To achieve the goal, local manufacturers will try to 
increase 
production of goods popular on the global market, particularly 
new mechanical and electrical products. 
  Furthermore, the municipal government will do everything 
within its power to expand production of 50 kinds of products 
each with an annual export topping five million dollars, and aid 
35 key manufacturers each exporting at least 20 million U.S. 
dollars' worth a year, the official said. 
  Meanwhile, the Pudong New Area, where flexible policies are 
being pursued to encourage Chinese and overseas investors, will 
try to broaden its foreign markets by giving full scope to its 
position as a free trade zone, he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Shen Xuanxin (3088 5503 2450): "Li Zemin at </F>
Provincial Discussion Meeting on Journalism Calls For Fully 
Understanding the New Situation and New Tasks Faced by 
Journalists and Enhancing a Sense of Political Responsibility in 
Guiding Public Opinion"] 
  [Text] Li Zemin, secretary of the provincial party 
committee, recently pointed out at a provincial discussion 
meeting on journalism: This year's tasks will be very heavy and 
arduous because we will center our work on establishing a 
socialist market economic structure and promoting reform in an 
all-round way. In the face of the new situation and new tasks, 
journalists must fully understand their heavy responsibility, 
correctly guide public opinion with a new outlook and work 
style, do a good and meticulous job in media work, and create a 
favorable social and media environment to promote reform, 
development, and stability. 
  Since the begining of reform and opening up, media work has 
developed rapidly in Zhejiang. The relations between the mass 
media and society and the people have become increasingly close, 
and the influence of the mass media on society and the people 
has also become greater and greater. The comrades on the 
journalism front have persisted in correctly guiding public 
opinion. Good progress has also been made in reforming 
journalist work and relatively great achievements have been made 
in media reporting. Li Zemin fully affirmed those results. He 
said: Now we have seen a good situation of political stability 
and economic development in this province, which is inseparable 
from the hard work of comrades on the journalism front. On 
behalf of the provincial party committee, I wish to express my 
heartfelt gratitude and extend my cordial regards to all 
comrades who have been working hard on the journalism front in 
this province, including comrades of the central news units 
stationed in Zhejiang. 
  After analyzing the current situation, tasks, and some weak 
links in media work faced by journalists, Li Zemin put forward 
demands on doing a good job in media work in the new year. He 
said: Under the new situation of establishing a socialist 
market economic structure, newspapers and radio and tv 
broadcasting -- the mouthpieces of the party, the government, 
and the people -- must firmly adhere to the principle and spirit 
of the party, be responsible to the party and people, persist in 
carrying out the policy of undertaking positive propaganda on 
unity, stability, and motivation, and firmly keep to the main 
theme [zhu xuan lu 0031 2467 1774] in guiding public opinion. 
Meanwhile, it is necessary to continuously, actively, and 
boldly explore how to reform journalism work and enable it to 
develop in concert with the development of economic 
construction, reform, opening up,and the all-around progress of 
society. These basic principles and policies must not change at 
any time. 
  Li Zemin called on comrades on the journalism front to fully 
understand the new situation and the honorable tasks they face 
in this period of great change, and to enhance their sense of 
political responsibility in guiding public opinion. He said: 
The current reform, from the reform in a single field to the 
overall situation, is more profound and difficult than the work 
in the past in terms of scope and effort. To smoothly promote 
reform we must have a favorable public opinion as well as a 
stable economic environment and a good social, political, and 
ideological environment. Correct guidance in public opinion can 
encourage and inspire the cadres and masses, while incorrect 
guidance in public opinion can create trouble or even bring 
about serious consequences. Therefore, journalists have a great 
responsibility in guiding public opinion. Through their 
effective work, journalists throughout the province must guide 
the broad masses of cadres and people to show concern for 
reform, understand reform, support reform, and take part in 
reform. In this way they can help promote the smooth progress of 
each reform and of their overall work, reduce risks, and achieve 
certain success. 
  Li Zemin said: For this year's tasks in media publicity, 
it is necessary to abide by the demand of the party's basic line 
of "one center, two basic points." We must emancipate our 
minds, do practical work, seize opportunities, accelerate reform 
and development, and correctly understand and handle the 
relations among reform, development, and stability. We must 
strive to comprehensively publicize the series of reform 
measures and policies of the party Central Committee and the 
provincial party committee and government. We should do a good 
job in publicizing the use of the criteria "conducive to three 
causes" [conducive to developing the productive forces of our 
socialist society, conducive to increasing the overall strength 
of our socialist country, and conducive to improving living 
standards] for judging success and failure and for unifying the 
thoughts of cadres and masses. As economic construction is the 
focal point, we should first do an effective job in publicizing 
economic work. The tasks should include further correcting and 
controlling the guiding thought for economic workers; further 
deepening the role of agriculture as the foundation of the 
national economy; and further deepening rural reform, reform in 
macroeconomic regulation and control, enterprise reform, and 
other supplementary reform measures. We should give more 
publicity to and strive to make some in-depth and influential 
reporting on major issues in opening up to the outside world. 
Meanwhile, it is necessary to improve publicity in socialist 
spiritual civilization and party building, as well as in 
building socialist democracy and the legal system. We should 
vigorously publicize our main tasks, Comrade Jiang Zemin's 
64-character call for pioneering spirit, patriotism, 
collectivism, and socialism. We should attach importance to 
publicizing the advanced examples, ideas, and experiences of 
workers, peasants, and intellectuals in the course of promoting 
the two civilizations. We must do a good job in reporting the 
study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, the study of the theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, and the task of fighting 
corruption and promoting clean government. 
  Li Zemin asked propaganda departments and press management 
departments of party committees at all levels and various press 
units to build a professional press team. Editors and 
journalists should be mobilized to earnestly study Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, the party's principles and policies, and the 
knowledge and laws pertaining to the socialist market economic 
system, so as to understand the overall situation and 
familiarize themselves with all policies. In particular, we 
must strictly demand from them a firm and correct political 
direction. Journalists and editors should be regularly sent to 
reform and construction frontlines to make in-depth 
investigation and study and write significant reports, so as to 
continually upgrade their professional standards and writing 
skills. Meanwhile, to stamp out the unhealthy practice of 
seeking personal gain from news writing, we must steadfastly 
resist and ban writing news for a fee . 
  Li Zemin expressed his hope that leading comrades from press 
units will concentrate their primary strength and energy on 
effective newspaper publication and effective planning for radio 
and television programs. He said: We should concentrate more 
of our energy on good publicity the larger the organization, the 
heavier the burden, and the greater the job. In addition, he 
asked party committees and governments at all levels to 
strengthen their leadership and attach more significance and 
support to the media. They should create essential conditions 
for press units to understand the overall situation and do an 
effective job. 
  Liang Pingbo, standing committee member of the provincial 
party committee and head of the Propaganda Department, presided 
over the discussion meeting. Over 20 people, including Shen Hui 
and Ma Peiyun, deputy heads of the Propaganda Department, as 
well as responsible comrades from major press units of Zhejiang 
Province and Hangzhou City and major central press units 
stationed in the province, attended the meeting.

<F P=106> [By Liu Yu (0491 1342): "Zhejiang Scores Gratifying </F>
Achievements in Foreign Trade and Economic Affairs"] 
  [Text] Our province scored gratifying achievements in 
foreign trade and economic affairs last year. These outstanding 
achievements included: We continued to deepen reform and open 
up wider to the outside world; foreign trade, exports, and 
imports continued to grow rapidly; the utilization of foreign 
capital continued to develop; and we made new progress in 
foreign economic affairs. 
  Last year, Zhejiang's total output value of exports and 
imports reached $6.111 billion, up 31.3 percent over last year. 
Exports reached $4.439 billion, surpassing the target set by 
the provincial planning commission and the provincial people's 
congress and 19.9 percent more than last year. We maintained 
stronger momentum for development in this area. Of these, 
exports of individually run enterprises increased 43.1 percent; 
exports of foreign-funded enterprises increased 64.5 percent; 
and, under a situation in which exports nationwide grew slowly, 
general exports of our province increased 14.2 percent over last 
year, making Zhejiang one of the top provinces in exports. 
  Thus far, 34 counties (cities) in Zhejiang have been 
designated coastal open economic areas. We have two coastal open 
cities, eight national development zones and development 
projects of various types involving whole tracts of land, and 37 
provincial development zones and agricultural development zones. 
An initial development structure for multilevel and all-round 
opening up has been established. By the end of last November, a 
total of 5,963 projects were introduced into our national and 
provincial development zones; among them, 953 are 
foreign-invested projects with contracted foreign capital 
totaling $2.564 billion, accounting for one-third of the entire 
province's contracted foreign capital. Development zones have 
become an important "window" for opening up and utilizing 
foreign funds. 
  Our provincial economic and trade systems continue to regard 
the utilization of foreign capital as a focus of their work, 
strengthening overall guidance, delegating examination and 
approval authority to lower administrative levels, improving 
service quality, and enhancing administrative efficiency. Last 
year, Zhejiang approved 4,487 new foreign-funded enterprises, up 
91.9 percent over the previous year; contracted foreign capital 
reached $3.746 billion, up 28.8 percent; and utilized foreign 
capital totaled $1.033 billion, up 251 percent. The number of 
newly established foreign-funded enterprises and their 
contracted foreign capital and utilized foreign capital exceeded 
the total amount accumulated in the past 14 years since reform 
and opening up, setting a record. 
  According to statistics, last year Zhejiang signed contracts 
worth $91.62 million for construction projects and labor service 
in foreign countries, up 21.4 percent over the previous year. 
By the end of last year, Zhejiang had set up 175 overseas 
enterprises with investments of 158 million.

  [Text] Zhanjiang, February 7 (XINHUA) -- Some 230 
kilograms of rhino horns were set on fire today in Zhanjiang, a 
booming town of south China's Guangdong Province as part of the 
efforts by the Chinese Government to perform its international 
obligations to stamp out smuggling and poaching and protect 
wildlife. 
  The rhino horns were part of the 825 kilograms confiscated 
by 
the Zhanjiang municipal government from smugglers and illegal 
trading. As 595 kilograms of rhino horns were identified as 
having been seized before China joined the Convention on 
International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) of wild fauna 
and flora in 1980, they were exempt from being destroyed. 
  Hundreds of local residents watched the police poured 
gasoline and set the huge pile to fire under the supervision by 
representatives from the Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of 
Public Security, the State Administration for Industry and 
Commerce and the State Office on the Control of Import and 
Export of Endangered Species. Among the audience was a 
four-member delegation from the CITES headed by its Chairman 
Murray Hosking and Secretary General Izgrev Topkov. 
  The move was hailed by the CITES delegation as a "courageous 
act of the Chinese Government." 
  "We find this burning ceremony very much a demonstration of 
the commitment of the Chinese Government to wild life 
conservation," said Murray Hosking, CITES chairman. 
  "We think it is a very important gesture," he said. "It 
would help people in other countries to understand the efforts 
made in China to protect endangered wildlife". 
  According to the Chinese official, since the country joined 
CITES in 1980, it has stopped importing rhino horns. 
  "Though no rhinos are found in the wild in China, the 
Chinese 
Government has listed it as one of the key wild animals for 
national protection, banning its sales, purchase, transportation 
and import and export," he said. 
  It was the second time for the Chinese Government to burn 
rhino horns in public this year. Earlier this year, 50 
kilograms of tiger bones (including fake ones) and rhino horns 
were burnt in Harbin in the country's northeastern Heilongjiang 
Province. 
  According to Chinese officials, all of the rhino horns which 
entered China before 1980 have been sealed by the government and 
will be used by Chinese scientists for experiment to find out 
substitutes for rhino horns, an important and very efficacious 
ingredient in many of the traditional Chinese medicine. 
  In the meantime, the Zhanjiang people's police has arrested 
a 
group of people headed by Lin Chengjie from the Wuchuan County 
Pharmaceutical Group Company for unsealing the rhino horns 
confiscated by the government to attempt to smuggle them out of 
the country. 
  Smugglers from overseas had colluded with Lin and bribed 
him. 
Chinese police said that it has the right to investigate 
overseas smugglers involved in the case and may demand them to 
stand witness in the court. 
  According to officials from the Ministry of Forestry, rhinos 
mainly live in economically less-developed countries and 
poaching and smuggling there were very serious. Natural 
disasters are also destroying the rhino population. 
  The number of rhinos have been reduced by 85 percent since 
the 1970s and only an estimated 10,000 are found in the world.

  [Text] Nanning, February 9 (CNS) -- The Guangxi Zhuang 
Autonomous Region has seen a change in its grain consumption 
with food grains other than wheat and rice such as corn and 
sweet potatoes being very keenly consumed by people there. 
  Such food as sweet potato, boiled corn, boiled peanuts and 
roasted chestnut are very popular there with the price of baked 
sweet potato increasing to up to 2.5 yuan per jin from several 
fens for each jin while that of rice is mere 1 yuan per jin. 
The profits earned from roasted chestnuts has risen by as much 
as 60 percent, much higher than that earned from rice. 
  An official from the Bureau of Agriculture in the region 
told 
this agency that in order to meet the needs in the market, the 
structure of grain production had changed there with the area 
for rice cultivation reducing while that for sugarcane growing 
increasing and totalling 1.45 million mu. The area under 
cultivation of soya bean, peanut and corn now exceeds 24 million 
mu with the total output increasing by more than 15 percent over 
last year.

  [Text] Hainan has made marked achievements in electric 
power development. Last year the province generated 1.9 billion 
kwh, an increase of 33.4 percent over the previous year. The 
gross output value amounted to more than 500 million yuan, an 
increase of 63.1 percent over the previous year. Last year 
electric power departments in the province made great efforts to 
increase electric power generation. [words indistinct] Since 
funding is guaranteed, the Nanshan electric power station can 
smoothly proceed with all its construction projects. Its first 
generating unit is expected to go into operation at the end of 
this February. 
  To guarantee the fulfillment of state key construction 
projects in the province, the Dagongba hydropower station has 
gone into operation earlier than scheduled. Electric power 
departments in the province have opened up all avenues to ensure 
power supply. The Xiubian electric power project, with a total 
investment of 73.95 million yuan, was completed and put into 
operation last October after one year of efforts. [words

  [Text] At a recent provincial meeting on foreign affairs, 
Governor He Zhiqiang, on behalf of the provincial party 
committee and government, demanded the enhancement of foreign 
affairs work so as to reach a new level, and the creation of a 
favorable external environment for Yunnan's modernization, 
reform, and opening up. Governor He Zhiqiang pointed out: The 
international situation, and particularly the situation in 
Southeast Asia, now is quite favorable to Yunnan's economic 
construction, reform, and opening up. Yunnan is facing the best 
development opportunity in history. He Zhiqiang asked foreign 
affairs cadres to uphold the party's basic line and to focus on 
economic construction in their work. He pointed out, in 
particular: Foreign affairs and foreign economic relations must 
be combined organically and made to promote each other. 
  On carrying out friendly cooperation with neighboring 
countries, He Zhiqiang proposed fulfilling the following six 
tasks: The first is to further develop good-neighborly 
relations and strengthen high-level friendly exchanges with 
neighboring countries. The second is to carry out cooperative 
projects with neighboring countries and to promote mutually 
beneficial cooperation. The third is to speed up highway 
construction. The fourth is to invite economic and trade 
delegations from neighboring countries and from other Southeast 
Asian countries to visit Yunnan to seek opportunities for common 
development. The fifth is to sponsor the Second Kunming 
Commodity Fair. The sixth is to take effective measures to 
encourage more Yunnan enterprises and companies to invest in 
neighboring countries.

  [Excerpts] In the provincial Scientific and Technological 
Activity Center on the afternoon of 5 February, the provincial 
science and technology association, the provincial labor 
department, and the provincial planning commission joinly held a 
tea party for people from scientific and technological circles 
in Xining. Provincial party and government leaders -- including 
Yin Kesheng, Yao Xiangcheng, Yang Maojia, La Bingli, and Bainma 
Dandzin -- attended. [passage omitted] 
  On behalf of the provincial science and technology 
association, the provincial labor department, and the provincial 
science and technology commission, Yin Yongzhang, chairman of 
the provincial science and technology association, expressed 
Lunar New Year greetings to the participants, saying: Last 
year, the province proceeded with scientific and technological 
work along the strategy of economic development, deepened 
scientific and technological structural reform, and steadily 
invigorated Qinghai by means of science and technology, thus 
stimulating the province's economic construction. The province 
unfolded the 3341 Scientific and Technological Experimental 
Project, the Torch Program, the Spark Program, the Good Harvest 
Program, and the Prairie Fire Program -- all of which directly 
benefited economic construction, played a positive role in 
popularizing the use of scientific and technological 
achievements, and made significant contributions to the 
province's scientific and technological development. Yin 
Yongzhang sincerely thanked scientific and technological 
personnel for their creative efforts and great contributions. 
  Provincial party Secretary Yin Kesheng also made a speech. 
On behalf of the provincial party committee and government, he 
expressed Lunar New Year greetings to scientific and 
technological personnel throughout the province, saying: 
Reviewing the past and looking to the future, we feel deeply 
the importance of scientific and technological work. Scientific 
and technological personnel in Qinghai have made great 
contributions to economic construction and social development. 
Our economy needs to be developed, and our science and 
technology need to be invigorated. As Qinghai is economically 
and culturally backward, the role of science and technology is 
particularly important. To narrow the gap between 
technologically advanced regions and ourselves, we must, in many 
aspects, rely on advanced science and technology, develop and 
expand the ranks of scientific and technological personnel, and 
improve the quality of the entire laborers. In the new 
situation of establishing the socialist market economic 
structure, science and technology also face a test. [passage

  [Text] A station reporter recently learned from the 
provincial labor and employment service bureau that the province 
made major progress in providing jobs last year. The job 
assignment rate hit a record high and the job-awaiting rate 
dropped to a new low in many years. By the end of last year, 
more than 29,000 people were provided jobs, the job assignment 
rate being 92.36 percent, an increase of 4.27 percent over the 
previous year, overfulfilling the job assignment target set by 
the provincial government. Last year the job-awaiting rate in 
cities and towns dropped to 2.9 percent, ranking in the 
forefront of the country. 
  Qiu Baichuan, chief of the provincial employment service 
bureau, said during an interview with our reporter that last 
year's good achievements in job assignments was mainly due to 
the establishment of the socialist market economic structure, 
which effectively promoted the carrying out of labor system 
reform and provided a policy guarantee and a relaxed environment 
for employment. Last year the province's national economy 
remained at a two-digit development rate, thus providing many 
job opportunities and positions for job-awaiting people and job 
seekers. In addition, the development of market economy greatly 
changed people's employment concept. Last year the number of 
people who obtained jobs in collective, individual, and private 
enterprises accounted for 80.41 percent of the total number of 
people who got employment.

  [Text] A province-wide foreign trade meeting closed in 
Xining recently. The meeting participants decided that the 
province's guiding principle for this year's foreign economic 
relations and trade is to correctly handle relations between 
foreign exchange earnings and economic returns, to 
simultaneously create foreign exchange earnings and improve 
economic returns, to simultaneously develop foreign economic 
relations, foreign capital, and foreign trade, and to fulfill or 
overfulfill various tasks in foreign economic relations and 
trade. 
  The meeting pointed out: This year, there is a need to 
deepen foreign trade system reform, to expedite the 
transformation of enterprise operational mechanisms, to 
gradually establish a modern enterprise system, to transform 
enterprises from state plan enforcers into import and export 
commodity dealers, to switch from state monopoly to market 
exploration, to bring about development amid fair competition, 
to form combinations between trade, industry, and commerce, to 
introduce the agency system, to take the development road of 
conglomeration and internationalization, to establish a personal 
responsibility system and improve it, to form a financial 
accounting and supervisory system, and to establish a mechanism 
for independent operation under which enterprises assume sole 
responsibility for their losses and profits, carry out self- 
development, and exercise self-control. In the meantime, it is 
necessary to cultivate a mentality of macro foreign trade, to 
help large and medium-sized productive enterprises, commercial 
sectors, and materials supplying enterprises to cater to the 
international market, and to further explore import and export 
channels. This year, a small number of enterprises with good 
economic results will be selected for reform experiments, and 
their experience will be gradually popularized. 
  To fulfill this year's export task of $100 million, the 
meeting requested foreign trade departments to exercise proper 
control over commodity purchases, to abide by a diversified 
strategy, to actively explore new markets, to encourage large 
and medium-sized productive enterprises, commercial sectors, and 
materials supplying enterprises, as well as foreign trade firms 
to tour the neighboring countries, to establish trade networks, 
and to expand foreign sales. 
  Provincial party Secretary Yin Kesheng addressed the closing 
ceremony. He hoped that staff members and workers in the 
foreign trade field would display the spirit of hard struggle 
and selfless devotion in developing the province's foreign trade 
to a higher level.

  [Excerpts] Yesterday the provincial government held a 
plenary meeting to discuss the draft government work report to 
be submitted to the Second Session of the Eighth Shaanxi 
Provincial People's Congress for examination. Before the 
meeting closed, Governor Bai Qingcai made an important speech 
focusing on six issues. 
  First, we should take the overall situation into account in 
everything we do. In considering their work, all fronts and 
departments should have the concept of proceeding from the 
overall situation and should effectively integrate centrally 
assigned tasks with their actual conditions. If they only 
consider their own interests in disregard of the overall 
situation, they will deviate from the general orientation. 
Because reform will cause an adjustment in powers and 
interests, we should proceed from the overall situation in this 
year's work. [passage omitted] 
  Second, we should change our concepts as soon as possible. 
Some of our concepts which have existed for many years are 
outdated. Without changing our concepts, we cannot seize the 
opportunity. The basic purpose of the party Central Committee 
in stressing the need to study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping is to arm ourselves with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, to 
improve our understanding, to emancipate our minds, and to 
change our concepts. 
  Third, we must have a down-to-earth work style. Now the 
tasks have been set and the objective is clear. The fulfillment 
of these tasks and objectives requires the unity and efforts of 
the entire people and the devotion of party members and cadres. 
It will not do for leaders not to have a down-to-earth work 
style. Leading cadres must set a good example for others to 
follow. 
  Fourth, discipline must be strengthened. To ensure the 
fulfillment of all reform objectives, to ensure uniformity in 
action, to ensure high efficiency in government work, to ensure 
uniformity and smoothness in government orders, and to ensure 
government authority in its administration, discipline must be 
further strengthened. Without strict discipline or uniformity 
in action, how can we exercise leadership over the great cause 
of socialist modernization? 
  Fifth, we should step up the formation of clean 
administration. We should be confident that the majority of our 
cadres are good, but we should not overlook the seriousness of 
corruption. We made certain achievements in combating 
corruption in the previous period, and this helped stop the 
spread of corruption, but we should not overestimate these 
achievements. We should soberly understand that the combat 
against corruption will remain protracted. 
  Sixth, we should really care for the masses' lives and 
deepen 
reform. Fundamentally speaking, this will benefit the masses. 
But benefits will differ in some aspects and some periods. 
When acknowledging the fact that most of the masses' lives are 
improving, leaders should not forget a small number of people 
who still have difficulties. Government institutions at all 
levels should do their best to help resolve their difficulties 
and show more concern for them. This is our unshirkable duty. 
  Vice Governors Xu Shanlin, Wang Shuangxi, Liu Chunmao, and 
Jiang Xinzhen attended the meeting. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Ma Lie: "Shaanxi Gears Up High-Tech Production"] </F>
  [Text] Xian--Shaanxi, one of China's technological 
powerhouses, is gearing up its high-tech development to bolster 
economic growth in this relatively under-developed inland 
province in Northwest China. 
  The main breakthroughs will be achieved by developing 
non-State-run high-tech enterprises, establishing a technology 
market and focusing on key research projects, according to Sun 
Haiying, director of the Shaanxi Provincial Science and 
Technology Committee. 
  "The total income of non-State high-tech enterprises this 
year will hit 1.5 billion yuan ($170 million), 28 percent more 
than last year, while the business volume in technological 
transactions will be 500 million yuan ($57 million)," Sun said. 
  Six out of 10 key research products developed this year will 
reach the production stage, he added. The rate of transferring 
technology development to production should be even faster, he 
noted. 
  This year, the province plans to build a technical 
market--the Northwest Technological Trade Centre, the largest of 
its kind in Northwest China. More than 1,000 technical market 
brokers will be trained in technology, business and management. 
Local governments will focus more on developing private 
high-tech enterprises that have flexible operation and 
management systems. Their development will be supported with 
loans through such channels as new technical credit 
cooperatives, Sun said. 
  "We hope the non-State high-tech enterprises will increase 
to 
more than 6,000 from the 4,000 in 1993," Sun said. 
  The province has identified 10 agricultural and 
manufacturing 
projects as vital to Shaanxi's economy. 
  These key projects will actively use foreign advanced 
technology and funds. 
  The province also plans to further widen its international 
co- operation and exchanges. This includes plans to attract 
foreign research institutes and enterprises to establish 
high-tech joint ventures in Shaanxi. 
  More local research organizations and manufacturers of 
high-tech products will also be encouraged to compete in the 
international market, Sun added. 
  Shaanxi's technological strength now ranks third in the 
country, behind only Beijing and Shanghai. Some 50 universities 
and colleges and more than 500 research institutes are located 
in the province.

  [Excerpts] According to statistics by a provincial 
agricultural survey team, in 1993 the peasants' per capita net 
income topped 600 yuan for the first time, to stand at 653 yuan. 
Allowing for inflation, their net income was 594 yuan, an 
increase of 63 percent. [passage omitted] 
  Important factors causing the increase in their income were, 
first, a good harvest in agricultural production; second, 
township and town enterprises' vigorous development; and third, 
a reduction in the peasants' expenditures. 
  In the income from agricultural production, the per capita 
net income from crop planting was 334 yuan and the per capita 
net income from animal husbandry was 67 yuan, an increase of 
respectively 19.9 percent and 15.2 percent over the previous 
year. Their per capita net income from tertiary industries was 
78.33 yuan, increase of 39.3 percent.

  [Text] The province has accelerated the pace of absorbing 
foreign firms and investment. Last year, the province topped $1 
billion in utilizing foreign funds, an increase of 76 percent 
over the previous year, and a record high in utilizing foreign 
funds since the commencement of reform and opening up. Last 
year, the province continuously improved the investment 
environment and increased the dynamics of absorbing foreign 
firms and investment, thus bringing forth a dramatic atmosphere 
in absorbing foreign firms and investment. Last year, the 
province approved a total of 1,718 projects that utilize foreign 
investment, an increase of 95 percent over the previous year. 
The source of foreign firms and foreign investment and the 
scale and scope of foreign investment were wider than in the 
past. Some internationally noted financial groups, 
transnational corporations, and large corporations arrived in 
the province to investigate and discuss investment projects. 
Thus far, more than 100 foreign corporations have set up 
agencies in the province, and more than 40 foreign countries and 
regions, including Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, the ROK, and the 
United States, have set up investment projects in the province. 
The province has also witnessed a good trend that large- and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises have utilized foreign funds 
to conduct renovations. Thus far, more than 500 large- and 
medium-sized enterprises have conducted renovations. By the end 
of 1993, the province approved a total of 3,383 projects 
invested in by foreign corporations, with the contracted value 
of foreign investment reaching $2.38 billion.

  [Text] He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party 
committee, sponsored a forum with the responsible comrades of 
the provincial level journalist units. During the forum he 
pointed out: Personnel engaged in journalism should uphold the 
correct guiding direction of public opinions. They should 
vigorously carry forward their major missions, enhance the 
construction of the journalist corps, continuously upgrade their 
working level, and create a good environment in public opinion 
for reform and development. 
  On the morning of 21 January, the meeting room on the third 
floor of the provincial party committee's building was filled 
with a happy and relaxed atmosphere, in which the responsible 
comrades of the provincial level journalist units delivered 
reports by bearing their working reality in mind regarding their 
past year's work in supporting the central work of the 
provincial party committee, in bringing their strong points into 
play, and in carrying out the propaganda work of journalism, as 
well as regarding the methods of conducting their work this year. 
  During the forum, Comrade He Zhukang fully acknowledged the 
work done by the provincial level journalist units over the past 
year. He said: Over the past year the provincial journalist 
front, in line with the central work of the provincial party 
committee, has done a great deal of work in building 
journalistic theories; publicizing economic affairs; giving 
guidance to public opinions; investigating and discussing 
situations; and popularizing knowledge. The front has fostered a 
journalistic pattern primarily consisting of positive 
propaganda, multiple propaganda styles, and a method of arousing 
people to progress which is being adopted. It has played an 
active role in promoting the province's programs of reform, 
opening up, and economic construction. The self-improvement of 
journalist units has also achieved new progress. It has also 
made active contributions to developing the tertiary industry 
and improving the conditions for raising funds. Some work done 
by our province's journalist units were commended or encouraged 
at the national appraisal events and have expanded the influence 
and exposure of Jilin Province. In this connection, the 
provincial party committee is very proud of them and I would 
like to take the opportunity to extend congratulations on their 
achievements, to express thanks for their contributions, and to 
extend cordial regards through the comrades at the forum to all 
journalist workers throughout the province. 
  During the forum, Comrade He Zhukang pointed out: We are in 
a period of large-scale development and changes. The year of 
1994 is the last period of improving the province's economy to a 
new level and also a crucial period of building Jilin into a 
developed, border, and maritime province. In facing such a 
situation and task, duties assumed by the journalist front are 
important and great and the provincial party committee places 
great hopes on the front. 
  Personnel engaged in journalistic work should uphold the 
principle of regarding positive propaganda as the main task and 
provide powerful support in public opinions for improving the 
province's economy to a new level and building Jilin into a 
developed province by the sea. In line with the demands of 
unity, stability, and arousal, they should give priority to 
their major professional missions. Deepening reform and 
accelerating development represent major tasks of our age as a 
whole. New demands were set by new situations and tasks. The 
journalistic work is exerting special efficacy and the 
journalist units should do a good job in directing the public 
opinions in the society. First of all these units, themselves, 
should make a clear distinction between right and wrong and dare 
to adopt a clear attitude. They should adopt a clear-cut 
attitude toward what they should advocate, carry forward, and 
resist. They should resolutely resist the things that have been 
proved as wrong, negative, and harmful. By no means should they 
leave these things unchecked. Journalistic propaganda has its 
own law. Journalists should study the law and deeply carry out 
investigation and study some problems so as to learn about the 
feelings of readers, audience, and viewers. They should foster 
the mental attitude of being high-spirited to make progress, 
actively conduct healthy and favorable propaganda, and resist or 
weaken the negative and retrogressed things. In conducting 
journalistic propaganda, it is imperative to integrate intention 
with results. 
  Comrade He Zhukang stressed: In conducting the work of 
journalistic propaganda, it is necessary to uphold a high 
standard and a strict demand; to enhance the construction of the 
journalist's contingent and the self-improvement of journalists; 
and to upgrade the level of journalists. Personnel engaged in 
journalistic work should steadily engage in study and upgrade 
their level through practice. Upgrading the work level has a 
bearing not only on technology and equipment but also on the 
quality of personnel. Journalists should stress ethics, observe 
the party's discipline, and implement the party's principles and 
policies. By no means should they conduct paid journalism. In 
conducting their work, journalists should advocate an earnest 
and rigorous work style. Personnel in every link, from 
reporters to editors and directors of newspaper offices and 
broadcasting stations, should earnestly take up their 
responsibility. The journalist units should strictly conduct 
management and their leading personnel should set themselves up 
as an example in boldly taking up and handling problems. These 
units should also do a good job in conducting self improvement, 
foster the characteristics of their own, upgrade their level, 
and broaden their influence. 
  (Li Zhongtain), member of the provincial party standing 
committee and director of the propaganda department under the 
provincial party committee, presided over the forum and also 
delivered a speech.

  [Text] Reform and opening up have made the motherland 
flourish every year, and the opening of border areas to link 
Jilin with the sea has made Jilin flourish everywhere. Today, 
Changchun's Nanhu Guesthouse was decorated with lanterns and 
colored streamers. On the occasion when the Spring Festival is 
about to arrive, the provincial party committee and the 
provincial government invited the personages from all circles in 
the province to the 1994 Spring Festival tea party held at Nanhu 
Guesthouse. Gao Yan, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee and governor of the province, presided over the party. 
Attending the party were leading comrades of the provincial 
party committee, the provincial people's congress standing 
committee, the provincial government, the provincial committee 
of Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the 
provincial higher people's court, and the provincial people's 
procuratorate. Also attending were former veteran comrades of 
the provincial level, leading comrades of the People's 
Liberation Army units stationed in Changchun, leading comrades 
of the provincial armed police force corps, chairmen of 
democratic parties at the provincial level, director of the 
provincial federation of industry and commerce, representatives 
of nonparty personages, principal responsible comrades of all 
departments and commissions under the provincial party 
committee, responsible comrades of pertinent departments under 
the provincial government, and principal responsible comrades of 
various people's groups. Also attending were representatives of 
intellectuals, teachers, model workers, our compatriots from 
Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, and other overseas areas; 
representatives of the people of minority nationalities and 
religious circles, and responsible comrades of the provincial 
civil aviation bureau and the Changchun railway subbureau. The 
total attendance surpassed 200 persons. Representatives from 
various circles happily met together to recall the past and 
compare it with the present and commonly celebrate the 
gratifying achievements scored by the province in the reform and 
opening up since last year. 
  He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
made 
an ebullient speech at the party. He first of all extended, on 
behalf of the provincial party committee and the provincial 
government, festive greetings and cordial regards to the fellow 
comrades and friends participating in the party. 
  He Zhukang said: Last year, we took a solid step along the 
road of reform and development under the guidance of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line. We conscientiously 
implemented the guidelines of the 14th party congress, 
integrated the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics with Jilin's realities, and defined, at the 
sixth provincial party congress, the strategic goal of building 
a developed border near-the-sea province. As a result, the 
people's ideas were enlightened greatly, and their field of 
vision was broadened. At the same time, the 25 million people 
of all nationalities in the province were encouraged to seize 
the opportunity to accelerate development. The whole province, 
from higher to lower levels, made concerted efforts to make the 
province prosperous. The land of Jilin was filled with the 
scene of spring and vitality. Last year, the province's GNP 
increased by 14.3 percent over the previous year, financial 
revenues increased by 24.2 percent after deducting the 
incomparable factors, the targets on pushing the economy onto a 
new stage were all fulfilled, new headway was made in science 
and technology, education, culture, art, sports, public health, 
press, and publication undertakings, living standards of urban 
and rural residents improved further, party building and the 
building of democracy and the legal system were strengthened, 
good results were achieved at the present stage of the 
anticorruption campaign, and new headway was made in the 
building of spiritual civilization. 
  He Zhukang said: Our province is now characterized by 
vigorous economic development, political stability, national 
unity, and social progress. All these achievements are the 
results of the hard work of the people throughout the province 
under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee. Here, on 
behalf of the provincial party committee and the provincial 
government, I want to express my heartfelt thanks for the hard 
work and contributions made by fellow comrades here, the vast 
number of workers, peasants, intellectuals, soldiers, armed 
police officers and men, public security cadres and policemen, 
our compatriots from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, overseas 
Chinese residing abroad, and foreign friends. 
  After explicitly setting forth the basic requirements for 
this year's work, Comrade He Zhukang stressed: To make this 
year's work a success, we must further emancipate the mind, 
strengthen the common understanding, enhance the concerted 
strength, and mobilize the initiative of all fields. The whole 
province from top to bottom should truly attend to work and pay 
attention to practical results. Leading cadres at all levels 
must actually improve the work style and the method of 
leadership to do more actual work and stop empty talk. In 
particular, leading cadres should conscientiously study Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and study and master the theory of the socialist 
market economy. In line with the requirements of unity, high 
efficiency, administrative honesty, and practical work, leading 
cadres should be strict in managing the party and the government 
in order to mobilize the masses to push forward all undertakings. 
  He Zhukang said in conclusion: In this new year, let us more 
closely rally around the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade 
Jiang 
  Zemin as its nucleus, and advance along the road of the 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and toward the 
magnificent objective of building a developed border 
near-the-sea province in order to win a new victory in reform, 
opening up, and modernization drive. 
  At the tea party, literary and art workers in the province 
staged brilliant performances.

  [Text] At the recent meeting of the standing committee of 
the provincial party committee, participants have specially 
listened to the guidelines of the national propaganda and 
ideological work conference. At the meeting, Cheng Weigao, 
secretary of the provincial party committee, expressed important 
opinions on how to successfully implement the guidelines of the 
instructions of the central authorities. 
  He said: In his speech to the national propaganda and 
ideological work conference, Comrade Jiang Zemin explicitly 
pointed out that the fundamental principle for the 1994 work is 
to comprehensively implement the guidelines of the 14th party 
congress and the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee, to accelerate the building of the socialist market 
economic structure, to maintain the sustained, rapid, and sound 
development of the national economy, to safeguard political 
stability, and to promote the all-round progress of society, 
under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic 
line. The provincial party committee, the provincial 
government, and all other levels of party committees and 
governments should firmly implement the fundamental principle 
for the 1994 work set forth by the central authorities, should 
explicitly, firmly, and unswervingly follow the instructions of 
the central authorities, should consciously submit themselves to 
the overall interest of the whole party, and should 
appropriately organize, arrange, and guide the work in all 
fields in line with the guidelines and instructions of the 
central authorities. 
  Cheng Weigao said: This year, centering on accelerating the 
pace of building the socialist market economic structure, we 
should really attend to the propaganda by media and use correct 
public opinions to guide the vast numbers of cadres and the 
masses to support, plunge into, and take part in reform. We 
should strengthen the sense of overall interest and handle 
affairs in accordance with the reform plans worked out by the 
central authorities. We should be meticulous in organization 
and careful in arrangements to ensure the smooth implementation 
of all reform measures. 
  Cheng Weigao said: Reform is in fact a process of 
readjusting the pattern and relationship of profits. At 
present, in maintaining stability, we should pay attention to 
the following several fields: We should correctly comprehend and 
comprehensively implement the principle of developing the 
national economy in a sustained, rapid, and sound manner and 
seize all possible opportunities to accelerate the pace of 
economic development in an effort to fulfill the goal of 
quadrupling the 1980 GNP and making the people relatively 
well-off. We must, however, persist in the principles of doing 
our best and acting according to our capability rather than 
lopsidedly pursuing high growth speed, blindly expand the scale, 
undertaking low-level and duplicated construction projects, and 
running after the output value without social demands and 
economic returns. We should place the emphasis of economic 
development on readjusting structure and deepening reform. We 
should pay high attention to and concentrate our efforts on the 
price work and on the price reform. At the same time, we should 
strengthen the inspection, supervision, and control over 
commodity prices. We must pay attention to the work concerning 
daily necessities to ensure the supply of daily necessities of 
the masses. We should conscientiously persist in the principle 
that first the people must have sufficient food and second 
socialist construction must be carried out. We should ensure 
the on-schedule issuance of wages to the administrative and 
institutional units. We should understand the weal and woe of 
the masses and properly solve the masses' difficulties in 
livelihood. We should resolutely deal blows to fake and 
inferior products to safeguard the interests of consumers. We 
should further attend to the building of democracy and the legal 
system, deeply conduct the education on the legal system, foster 
the authority of the law, and handle affairs in strict 
accordance with the law. 
  Cheng Weigao demanded: The emphasis of economic work should 
be really shifted to deepening reform, changing mechanisms, 
optimizing structures, and improving efficiency. At present, we 
should give prominence to the work in the following several 
aspects: We should truly put agriculture in an essential 
position, and firmly and unremittingly grasp the production of 
grain, cotton, and edible oil. We should develop the rural 
economy in an all-round manner. We should conscientiously 
implement the guidelines of the central rural work conference, 
stabilize the basic policies concerning the countryside, deepen 
the rural reform, and ensure the stable increase in grain, 
cotton, and edible oil output. We should appropriately fix the 
scale of investment in fixed assets and the speed of economic 
development. We should not only ensure the fulfillment of the 
targets set for every quarter but also ensure the basic balance 
between total supply and total demand in an effort to avoid 
major ups and major downs in the economy and to ensure the 
smooth progress of reform in a relatively relaxed environment. 
We should energetically develop the large and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises, should continue to guide enterprises to 
change their mechanisms and make explorations and innovations 
for the modern enterprise system. In opening to the outside 
world, we should accelerate the pace and stress on practical 
results. At the same time, we should further pay attention to 
opening to the domestic areas, extensively develop lateral 
integrations and cooperation, energetically develop education 
and scientific and technological undertakings. 
  Cheng Weigao stressed in conclusion: In face of the arduous 
tasks on this year's reform and construction, leading organs and 
leading cadres at all levels must further improve their 
leadership art, improve their work style, and pay attention to 
implementation of their work.

  [Text] Tianjin, February 6 (XINHUA) -- Tianjin, the largest 
industrial city in north China, is to employ more foreign funds 
to improve facilities and operations of a third of its old 
businesses this year. 
  The city will complete the transformation of all the 
existing 
old enterprises in eight years, in order to resume its important 
position in China's industry, according to an official of the 
city economic committee. 
  He said that in 1994, 120 state-run factories will become 
joint ventures. Over 70 foreign-funded projects will go into 
operation. 
  Backed by skilled workers and strong technology, the city 
has 
seen good results in the campaign to upgrade old businesses. 
  At present, the output value and sales of the industrial 
joint ventures have accounted for 48 percent of the total. 
  It is also reported that 18 upgraded enterprises have 
reached 
100 million yuan in output value each, with a batch of 
competitive products entering the domestic market. 
  The official said that last year, the city's industrial 
sector introduced 600 million U.S. dollars for 197 
foreign-funded projects. 
  Tianjin has more than 5,000 enterprises in the fields of 
electronics, textiles, pharmaceuticals and machinery, with 
nearly 100 national name-brands.

  [Text] Beijing, Feb 9 (AFP) -- China's ageing paramount 
leader, Deng Xiaoping, on Wednesday made his first appearance on 
television in more than a year, looking frail and apparently 
speaking with difficulty. Deng, 89, was filmed at a Lunar New 
Year's reception in Shanghai, the television said. The report 
of more than four minutes on the national evening news showed 
him looking frail, with a somewhat vacant look, and walking with 
difficulty, supported all the while by two of his daughters, 
Deng Rong and Deng Nan. 
  The television said Deng spoke to local officials, wishing 
them a successful new year and predicting "new victories" for 
China. But the report did not give the sound of Deng's voice, 
merely reporting his message. The few words he spoke were 
apparently pronounced with difficulty. 
  He also expressed best wishes to communist party secretary 
Jiang Zemin and called on communists to unite around Jiang, who 
is also head of state and touted by analysts as a likely 
successor to Deng, the report said. Deng also congratulated the 
people of Shanghai, China's largest city, for their economic 
success. 
  China's media reported only four brief outings by the 
supreme 
leader in Beijing and Shanghai late last year, but no 
photographs or television images were shown. The official news 
agency Xinhua, in a dispatch marked "urgent", said Deng 
"exchanged spring festival greetings with local officials and 
retirees." 
  Deng holds no official post other than that of president of 
the China bridge players' association, although he remains at 
the top of China's political power structure. He was spending 
his seventh consecutive Lunar New Year in Shanghai, China's 
biggest city. The new year's celebration, which is on Thursday, 
is the biggest date in the Chinese calendar, and the occasion 
for feasting and family reunions.

apparent difficulty, Deng's emaciated face betrayed no emotion 
and he appeared unable to respond directly to the words of local 
officials, with his daughters needing to repeat their words 
close to his ears. [passage omitted] 
  Wednesday's news also showed footage of Deng in Shanghai on 
December 13 and 31, visiting a new bridge and a new hotel. 
Deng's last television appearance was in January last year.

<F P=106> [By reporter Chen Maodi (7115 3029 1717) ] </F>
  [Text] Shanghai, 9 Feb (XINHUA) -- As the Spring Festival, 
a traditional holiday of the Chinese people, draws near, Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping happily got together with responsible party, 
government, and military comrades of Shanghai municipality and 
some veteran comrades this afternoon, exchanging Spring Festival 
greetings and regards. 
  This was the seventh consecutive year Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
joined people in Shanghai to mark the Spring Festival since 1988. 
  The hall of meeting was decorated with flowers and imbued 
with a spring atmosphere. With a smile, Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
walked to the front of the comrades in Shanghai in high spirits 
and with firm strides. Wu Bangguo, member of the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the Shanghai 
Municipal party committee, and Huang Ju, Shanghai mayor, stepped 
forward to express their sincere blessings to Comrade Xiaoping. 
  Wu Bangguo said: "On behalf of the 13 million people in 
Shanghai, I wish you a happy Spring Festival, health, and long 
life; I wish your whole family happiness." 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "I wish the leading comrades of 
the central authorities with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core a 
happy Spring Festival and good health. I wish people throughout 
the country a happy Spring Festival, happy family lives, unity, 
and greater victories in the new year." 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "I come to Shanghai once a year 
to wish the people in Shanghai a happy Spring Festival." 
  Wu Bangguo said: "This is your encouragement for people in 
Shanghai. It shows your concern and support for the work in 
Shanghai." 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping said happily: "You people in Shanghai 
have done a really good job in your work." 
  During his stay in Shanghai, Comrade Deng Xiaoping showed 
great concern for Shanghai's material and spiritual 
construction. He fully affirmed the successes achieved by 
people in Shanghai in the past year. He said: "Shanghai has 
accomplished its work very well. Shanghai has special qualities 
and character. Shanghai is fully capable of proceeding faster." 
  On 13 December 1993, Shanghai was engulfed by force 6 chilly 
wind and drizzle. The temperature abruptly dropped to about 
zero degrees Celsius. On the morning of that day, Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping, accompanied by Wu Bangguo, Huang Ju, and others, 
inspected Pudong and ascended the Yangpu Bridge to view the 
teeming construction in Pudong. Having inspected the Pudong 
section of the inner ring and the two overpasses over Luoshan 
Road and Longyang Road, which were completed last year, Comrade 
Xiaoping said with a smile: "Watching these roads with joy 
today is better than reading books for 100 years." He told 
Comrades Wu Bangguo and Huang Ju: "These words are from the 
bottom of my heart." 
  Standing on the magnificent Yangpu Bridge, Comrade Xiaoping 
held the hands of Zhu Zhihao, chief commander of the 
construction of the bridge, and praised him: "This is a victory 
of the Shanghai working class. I salute the Shanghai working 
class!" 
  On the eve of the New Year, in the company of Wu Bangguo, 
Huang Ju, and others, Comrade Deng Xiaoping ascended to the top 
floor of the Jinjiang Tower, looking down the brightly 
illuminated Shanghai streets. He said: "Shanghai has changed." 
Seeing Comrade Deng Xiaoping unexpectedly, Chinese and foreign 
tourists marking the holiday at the hotel could not but give him 
a long applause and express their respect and best wishes to 
him. With a smile, Comrade Xiaoping waved to them in 
acknowledgement. This evening, he also went to the congested 
Nanjing Road and the bund to enjoy the jubilation of the holiday 
with people in Shanghai. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping was very pleased to hear that the 
Dayawan Nuclear Power Plant No. 1 generator unit had been 
successfully put into operation. This morning, he asked Comrade 
Li Peng to convey his congratulations and gratitude to the 
builders, scientists, and technicians of Dayawan Nuclear Power 
Plant.

<F P=106> [By Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Liu </F>
Zhenying (0491 2182 5391) and XINHUA reporter Zheng Qingdong 
(6774 1987 2639)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 9 Feb (XINHUA) -- The State Council 
General Office sponsored a get-together in Zhongnanhai this 
morning to exchange Spring Festival greetings. Premier Li Peng, 
other leading comrades of the State Council, cadres and staff 
workers of State Council organs, and some veteran comrades 
happily got together to exchange greetings and usher in the new 
spring. 
  On behalf of leading State Council comrades, Premier Li Peng 
extended his festive greetings to all cadres and staff workers 
of the State Council General Office, organs directly under the 
State Council, and relevant departments, as well as their 
dependents. Li Peng expressed his wholehearted thanks for the 
outstanding jobs they have done in the past year. 
  In his speech, Li Peng said: The year 1993 which has just 
gone by was a year of unusual achievements, and 1994 will be a 
year with even more magnificent success. The principles set by 
the party Central Committee -- "seize the opportunity to deepen 
reform, open up wider to the outside world, expedite 
development, and maintain stability" -- are extremely 
significant for China's development and progress. He said: 
Ever since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee, China has achieved world-renowned successes in its 
reform and opening up endeavors, our economy has been developing 
rapidly, our reform policies have had the support of the people, 
and the international situation has always been favorable to us. 
Confronted with such a gratifying situation, we will continue 
to deepen reform and open up wider to the outside world. The 
series of major measures for reform to be launched this year are 
meant for further pushing our country toward building a 
socialist market economic system so that even greater successes 
will be achieved in our national economic development. 
  Li Peng said: Development has always been our central task 
and the basic objective of all our reform projects. We must 
work hard to improve the people's living standards and help the 
whole nation to become affluent as quickly as possible. 
However, social stability is an indispensable prerequisite and 
condition for reform and development. If we fail to maintain 
social stability, we will be unable to launch the measures for 
reform, and our causes will not be able to proceed successfully. 
Under the current situation, therefore, we must correctly 
handle the relationship among reform, development, and stability 
so that China's economic development can proceed in a sustained, 
rapid, and healthy manner. 
  Li Peng noted: We, the Chinese nation, are now at a period 
of rapid development. Cadres of state organs should feel 
honored and proud of being able to directly take part in making 
and enforcing decisions about reform, opening up, and 
modernization. Li Peng urged all cadres and staff members of 
the State Council to continue to work hard to accomplish all 
assignments of the party and the people, achieve new successes, 
and make even greater contributions during the year. 
  Zou Jiahua, Qian Qichen, Li Lanqing, Li Tieying, Chi 
Haotian, 
Song Jian, Li Guixian, Chen Junsheng, Peng Peiyun, Chen Muhua, 
Gu Mu, and other comrades were present at the gathering, which 
was chaired by Luo Gan, state councillor and secretary general 
of the State Council. 
  During the gathering, Chinese Coalminers Song and Dance 
Ensemble artists staged colorful entertainment programs.

  [Text] When Spring Festival, a traditional festival of 
Chinese people of all nationalities, is around the corner, Wu 
Bangguo, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau 
and secretary of the Shanghai municipal party committee, and 
Huang Ju, Shanghai mayor, visited Comrade Chen Yun, who is in 
Shanghai, to wish him a happy Spring Festival, health, and long 
life. [video shows close-up of a seated Chen Yun shaking hands 
with Shanghai CPC Secretary Wu Bangguo and Shanghai Mayor Huang 
Ju.] 
  Comrade Chen Yun happily received the comrades in Shanghai 
and had cordial conversations with them. 
  Comrade Wu Bangguo briefed Comrade Chen Yun on what Shanghai 
did in 1993 in launching reforms, opening up to the outside 
world, developing the economy, and maintaining social stability; 
as well as on what Shanghai will do this year. 
  Comrade Chen Yun was very satisfied with the information. He 
said: The work Shanghai has accomplished is very good -- not 
just good, but very good. [video shows medium close-ups of a 
seated Chen Yun having talks with seated Wu, Huang, and other 
Shanghai officials in what appears to be a guest room. Chen 
Yun, dressed in a light gray Mao suit, looks frail but alert and 
reasonably healthy with fair complexion. He occasionally 
gesticulates with his right hand to emphasize a point and his 
head moves about freely and naturally]. 
  Comrade Chen Yun added: Since the Third Plenary Session of 
the 11th CPC Central Committee in 1978, the nation's economic 
development has been very fast, and the people's living 
standards have improved significantly. This is a fact everybody 
can see. Of course, there are still many difficulties and 
problems. To deal with these difficulties and problems, we 
must, first of all, safeguard and strengthen [wei hu he jia 
qiang] the authority [quan wei] of the party Central Committee 
with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core. If the Central Committee 
does not have the authority, nothing significant can be 
accomplished, and social stability cannot be maintained. 
  Comrade Chen Yun said: The Central Committee has decided to 
implement the revenue-sharing system this year so that central 
authorities can gradually pool the financial resources they 
need. Shanghai and other localities have supported this idea. 
This shows that you have taken the interests of the whole into 
consideration. I am very pleased about this. 
  Comrade Chen Yun said: The situation of the country shows 
that today's economic work should pay special attention to one 
issue, namely the size of our construction projects must be 
compatible with the national strength. Moreover, there should 
be some leeway to maneuver. Meanwhile, we must focus our 
attention on achieving higher economic returns. [video 
continues to show medium close-ups and close-ups of Chen Yun 
speaking and Wu Bangguo nodding his head and smiling in apparent 
agreement. While Chen speaks he gesticulates with one hand, 
then the other, switching what appears to be a rubber ball when 
changing the gesticulating hand. Chen's head moves quite 
naturally both laterally and horizontally] 
  In conclusion, Comrade Chen Yun stressed: The current 
central leading group is a strong and capable one. Its 
performance is good. People throughout the country must work 
with one heart and one mind, unite as one, and fully implement 
the series of policies and measures which the party Central 
Committee and the State Council have adopted for exercising 
macroscopic regulation and control. When we do this, China is 
very likely to boost its economic development, and socialist 
China will have a bright future. 
  Other Shanghai party and government leaders who wished 
Comrade Chen Yun a happy Spring Festival today were Chen Zhili, 
Wang Liping, and Chen Liangyu, as well veteran comrades Chen 
Guodong, Hu Lijiao, and Wang Daohan.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter He Jiazheng (0149 0502 2973) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Zhu Youdi (2612 1635 2769)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 1 Feb (XINHUA) -- A festival atmosphere 
filled the Great Hall of the People this evening, at which an 
art and literary Spring Festival party was held by the State 
Education Commission to extend regards to personnel who have 
returned to the country from studying abroad. Hu Jintao, member 
of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau, attended the party. On behalf of the party Central 
Committee and the State Council, Li Lanqing, member of the CPC 
Central Committee Political Bureau and vice premier of the State 
Council, extended festival greetings to comrades who have 
returned to China after completion of their studies abroad and 
are now industriously working on the various fronts; to the 
personnel who are still studying abroad far away from their 
relatives; and to their dependents. 
  Before the start of the performances, Hu Jintao and Li 
Lanqing met with more than 20 representatives of returned 
personnel who had made outstanding contributions to the country, 
having a cordial conversation with them. More than 6,000 
returned students from Beijing and Tienjin, as well as personnel 
engaged in the work of sending students to study overseas, 
gathered in the hall to greet the new year. The evening party 
was presided over by the State Education Commission's Zhu 
Kaixuan. 
  In his speech, Li Lanqing thanked the comrades of 
departments, localities, and universities and schools who have 
always supported and attached importance to the work of sending 
students overseas and helping them return home, and who have 
given full play to the role of students who have returned from 
abroad. He also thanked all educators who have been engaged in 
training qualified personnel. 
  He stated: Going to study overseas is closely related to the 
great cause of reform and opening up to the outside world. Over 
the past 15 years, China has sent more than 200,000 students to 
study overseas, and 70,000 of them have returned to China. 
These returned students, as well as those who returned later 
on, have played an important role in reform, opening up to the 
outside world, and the modernization drive. Many of them have 
made outstanding contributions. Your hard work and dedication 
have not only won the respect of society but have been affirmed 
by it. 
  Li Lanqing pointed out: The present domestic and 
international situations are very conducive to our modernization 
drive. Our country is seizing favorable opportunities, 
deepening reform, opening up wider to the outside world, 
promoting development, safeguarding stability, and making 
efforts to establish a socialist market economy and promote the 
development of productive forces. To realize our goal, we must 
open up wider to the outside world, boldly absorb and learn from 
all civilized achievements created by mankind, and make use of 
the strong points of foreign countries; we must follow 
scientific and technological developments throughout the world, 
make continuous innovations in this field, and strive to carve 
up a position in the field of high science and technology. Li 
Lanqing said: In this respect, the students who are studying 
abroad shoulder a heavy but glorious mission as they have 
knowledge and experience in international exchanges. The 
motherland and the people hope the returned students will work 
harder and continue to make new contributions. He said: Those 
personnel who are still studying abroad love the motherland, 
show concern for the country's construction and development, and 
have done great of work in this respect. Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
has said: "To make contributions, it is better to return to the 
country." We warmly welcome more students studying abroad to 
return home to make contributions to the country. 
  Li Lanqing added: In the days to come, it is hoped all 
localities, departments, and universities and schools will 
continue to earnestly implement the principle of "supporting 
studying overseas, encouraging a return to the country, and 
ensuring freedom in coming and going" in order to further 
improve the work of helping students studying abroad return home 
and to create a good working and living environment for returned 
students so as to enable them to play a role and make still 
greater contributions in the great cause of reform, opening up 
to the outside world, and the modernization drive. 
  At the evening party, literary and art workers in Beijing, 
as 
well as representatives of the students who have returned from 
abroad, staged colorful performances on the same stage. 
  Buhe, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the 
National 
People's Congress, as well as responsible persons of the 
Organizational, Propaganda, and United Work Departments of the 
CPC Central Committee; the State Science and Technology 
Commission; the Ministry of Personnel; the Ministry of Culture; 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences; the CYL Central Committee; the 
Political Department of the Liberation Army; and relevant 
departments of Beijing Municipality attended the party.

<F P=106> [Speech by Hu Jintao, vice chairman of the CPC Central </F>
Organization Committee and member of the CPC Central Committee 
Secretariat and CPC Political Bureau, given at a Spring Festival 
tea party for veteran comrades on 1 February 1994 -- place not 
mentioned] 
  [Text] Beijing, 1 Feb (XINHUA) -- Comrades: 
  This tea party is given by the CPC Central Committee 
Organization Department, the People's Liberation Army General 
Political Department, and the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee 
for veteran comrades presently in Beijing to usher in the 
approaching Spring Festival, a traditional festival of the 
Chinese people. On behalf of the party Central Committee and 
the State Council, I wish to extend their festival regards and 
lofty respects to you veteran comrades here today and all the 
retired veteran cadres in the country, as well as veteran 
comrades working on all fronts! 
  The past year was one in which the whole party and people of 
all nationalities in the country fully implemented the 
guidelines laid down by the 14th national party congress and 
marched forward victoriously along the course charted by Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. The nation continued to maintain the good 
momentum of thriving development in reform, opening up, and 
modernization. New successes were achieved on all fronts -- 
industrial, agricultural, scientific-technological, educational, 
cultural, defense, and foreign affairs. Our party became 
stronger and better. Because of our economic growth, political 
stability, solidarity among people of all nationalities, and 
social progress, the country as a whole was full of life and 
vitality. 
  The year 1994 is crucial for the development of reform, 
opening up, and modernization in China. The basic policy for 
this year's work is: Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as well as by 
the basic party line, we will accelerate the process of building 
a socialist market economic system; maintain a sustained, fast, 
and healthy national economic development; maintain political 
stability; and expedite progress in all social sectors -- doing 
all this by implementing the guidelines laid down by the 14th 
national party congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee. Seizing the opportunity to deepen 
reform, open up wider to the outside world, expedite 
development, and maintain stability is an assignment of overall 
importance for the whole party. To expedite the great cause of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we must have a 
clear idea of this assignment, obey and serve it, proceed with 
our work cautiously and earnestly, firmly develop our socialist 
market economy, and firmly promote socialist democracy and 
spiritual construction. 
  The "CPC Central Committee Decision on Issues About Building 
a Socialist Market Economic System" adopted by the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee is an indicator of the 
beginning of a new stage at which China will achieve 
breakthroughs at major points while promoting economic reform in 
all areas. An integral part of our basic socialist system, the 
socialist market economic system we are now building will enable 
the market to play a fundamental role in the distribution of 
resources under the state's macroscopic regulation and control. 
The basic objective is to further liberate and develop 
productive forces so that China's sustained, fast, and healthy 
economic development can be guaranteed institutionally. 
Meanwhile, we must also realize that, as reform continues to 
deepen, we will inevitably have to restructure the existing 
patterns and relationships of interests, encounter deep- rooted 
problems, and deal with complex and unprecedented situations and 
issues. We are now reforming the economic system as we are 
having a high economic growth, we also have to maintain a high 
economic growth while accelerating the process of structural 
change; we must also attach great importance to social and 
political stability. To make sure that all of the Central 
Committee's reform decisions will be carried out, we must 
provide stronger leadership, know the entire situation, and 
correctly handle the dialectical relationship between reform and 
development on the one hand and stability on the other so that 
our reform programs and construction projects can proceed in a 
healthy and orderly manner. 
  To accomplish this year's formidable reform and 
construction assignments, we must do an even better job in 
upholding the party's ideological line of emancipating our minds 
and seeking truth from facts; in upholding the party's basic 
line of work -- namely doing everything for the masses, counting 
on the masses in doing everything, coming from the masses, and 
going to the masses; and in integrating the party's ideological 
and mass lines. We must continue to change those ideas and 
concepts which are incompatible with building a socialist market 
economic system and firmly push reform forward. We must 
earnestly change our work style, go deep into the realities of 
life to conduct investigation and study, insist on doing things 
in the light of materialist dialectics, and concentrate our 
efforts on accomplishing all assignments and dealing with 
outstanding problems obstructing reform and construction. We 
must seriously listen to what the masses have to say, understand 
their feelings, care for their plight, do ideological and 
political work among the masses deeply and meticulously, strive 
to deal with those practical problems vital to their personal 
interests, and always pay attention to guiding and protecting 
the masses' enthusiasm so that they can bring their initiative 
into play. Our party counts on the masses for its source of 
strength and for winning victories. So long as we depend on the 
masses, establish close ties with them, rally the strength of 
the nation, and mobilize the positive factors in all quarters, 
we can surmount every difficulty in our way and our cause in all 
fields will be invincible. 
  The CPC is the leading core of our socialist construction. 
Building the CPC into a stronger party is the basic guarantee 
for winning the victory in building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics as well as by 
the party's basic line, we must focus on economic construction, 
strive to adapt to the new situation of building a socialist 
market economic system, consciously uphold the party's character 
as being the vanguard of the working class and its objective of 
serving the people wholeheartedly, and continue to build a 
stronger and better party; and we also must strengthen all party 
organizations' coherence, rallying power and militancy during 
the course of reform, development, and stability so that our 
party will be able to play its nuclear leading role more 
effectively. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics epitomizes the rich 
experiences we have gained from launching reform, opening up to 
the outside world, and carrying out socialist construction. This 
theory is the spiritual pillar and scientific guide leading us 
to continue to march forward victoriously. During this new 
year, we must continue to organize the vast number of cadres and 
party members to thoroughly study Volume 3 of the Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping, and accomplish the 14th national 
party congress assignment of arming the whole party with the 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
Leading groups must earnestly strengthen their ideological 
construction and improve their work style. They must uphold and 
improve democratic centralism and maintain a high degree of 
political and ideological unity and unity in actions. We must 
make great efforts to train and promote outstanding young cadres 
in accordance with the requirement that cadres must be more 
revolutionary, better educated, younger in average age, and 
professionally more competent as well as the principle that our 
cadres must be ethical and capable. To meet the needs of the 
new situation, all leading groups must make constant efforts to 
improve their capabilities of leading the socialist market 
economy, build stronger grass-roots party organizations, and 
explore ways and means of establishing party organizations in 
all types of new economies. The anticorruption struggle is an 
important task for building stronger party and government 
organizations, and it is a task having a close bearing on the 
future and destiny of our party and state. We must thoroughly 
understand the struggle's protracted nature and formidability. 
On the basis of consolidating the successes that have been 
achieved, we must continue to wage this struggle in a sustained, 
deep-going, and more effective manner so that we can win the 
trust of the people and ensure the normal development of reform, 
opening up, and socialist modernization. 
  Comrades! Building an affluent, strong, democratic, and 
civilized socialist modern China is an ideal shared by all 
Chinese people, and a great goal of our party during the new 
period. The achievement of this great idea requires the 
strenuous and untiring efforts exerted by people of many 
generations. You veteran comrades are a precious wealth of our 
party and state. During all historical periods of revolution 
and construction, you have done all you possibly can, dedicated 
yourselves selflessly, and endured all hardships. The 
historical services you have rendered in winning the victory of 
the new democratic revolution; in building the socialist system; 
in developing the socialist cause; in promoting reform, opening 
up, and modernization; and in building a prosperous and strong 
motherland are unerasable. Your brilliant successes will go 
down in the annals. We will forever cherish, inherit, and carry 
forward the steadfastness; conviction; wisdom; experiences; 
lofty spirit and examples, fine traditions, and conduct which 
you veteran comrades have developed during the protracted 
struggles. During the new historical period, your important 
roles in developing the economy, expediting reform and opening 
up, safeguarding social stability, and intensifying spiritual 
construction will still be irreplaceable. We believe that you 
will continue to care for and support all projects of reform and 
construction, help the vast number of middle-aged and young 
cadres to grow up healthily, and will continue to make new 
contributions during the new period. The vast number of 
middle-aged and young cadres must humbly learn from veteran 
comrades; do a good job in taking over the veteran comrades' 
spirit of waging heroic revolutionary struggle; serve as links 
of the past and the future; and strive to contribute to 
expediting reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. 
  An important project of the party and government is the 
project about veteran cadres. Currently, the nation has more 
than 7 million retired cadres. Party committee and governments 
at all levels must heighten their understanding of veteran 
cadres' affairs, improve their leadership over veteran cadres' 
affairs, earnestly study the new situations and new issues of 
veteran cadres' affairs, and sum up new experiences. We must 
care for veteran cadres politically and take care of their 
livelihood. While drawing up new measures for reforms, we must 
also gradually establish and improve the social security system 
and take timely steps to study, resolve veteran cadres' 
practical living problems, and do something practical for them 
so that our veteran cadres can provide and do something, learn 
something, enjoying life during their remaining years. 
  Comrades! The nineties are important for the development of 
our party and state. Our cause cannot be more grandiose and our 
future cannot be brighter. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and that of the party's basic line, let us rally 
even closer around the party Central Committee with Comrade 
Jiang Zemin as the core, work with one heart and one soul, be 
determined in launching reform, take the initiative in our own 
hands, make painstaking efforts in doing pioneering work, and 
work hard to finish building an initial socialist market 
economic system and achieving the magnificent goal of China's 
socialist modernization by the end of this century. 
  Finally I wish you a pleasant Spring Festival, good health, 
and a happy family life!

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Senior Central Officials Make </F>
Inspection Tours During Spring Festival To Improve 
`Party-Masses' Relations and Study Contradictions Arising From 
Reform"] 
  [Text] During the spring festival this year, senior 
Chinese leaders will turn to division of labor and take part in 
new year celebrations organized for the masses in Beijing and 
local provinces. Apart from getting close to the people and 
improving relations between the party and the masses, one of the 
purposes of making the trips before and after Lunar New Year's 
Day is to study and handle the new contradictions and problems 
arising from reform. 
  According to informed sources, Li Ruihuan, Standing 
Committee 
member of the Political Bureau and chairman of the National 
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference, arrived in Guangdong's Zhuhai yesterday and will 
spend the new year in Guangdong. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, 
another Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau, is 
currently inspecting Sichuan. Vice President Rong Yiren and Tian 
Jiyun, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National 
People's Congress, yesterday attended the spring festival party 
for the people and servicemen in the Guangzhou areas. CPC 
General Secretary Jiang Zemin, who is also state president, and 
Premier Li Peng will stay in Beijing to "spend the new year." 
Jiang and Li will attend a large-scale spring festival 
get-together party organized by the CPC Central Committee and 
the State Council, on 10 February (Lunar New Year Day) in the 
Great Hall of the People. 
  Although rumors have recently circulated that CPC elder Deng 
Xiaoping will come to Guangdong, an informed source said that 
this year Deng Xiaoping will still follow his old habit and 
spend the new year in Shanghai. 
  Informed sources pointed out that visits by senior CPC 
leaders before and during the spring festival (Jiang Zemin went 
to Shanxi, Li Peng went to Guangdong, Zhu Rongji went to Fujian 
and Sichuan, and Li Ruihuan went to the Zhuhai and Shenzhen 
Special Economic Zones) are related to the important reform 
measures to be announced this year. The several reforms to be 
launched will involve bold measures which will be announced 
within a short period of time, and will touch on very 
complicated relations; therefore, the senior level in Beijing 
must study and grasp the new contradictions and problems which 
are arising in large numbers from the process of reform, and it 
also has to coordinate relations between the central and local 
authorities after the implementation of the revenue-sharing 
system. In particular, it has to soothe the local leaders a bit 
and address the grievances among some "local lords." 
  The official XINHUA NEWS AGENCY yesterday verified an 
exclusive report by this newspaper the previous day that Premier 
Li Peng left Shenzhen for Huizhou for inspection. XINHUA said 
that after cutting a ribbon to open the commercial operation of 
No. 1 generator in Guangdong's Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant, Li 
Peng arrived in Huizhou for inspection, sending new year's 
greetings to the masses. 
  XINHUA also quoted Li Peng's remarks that Guangdong is at 
the 
front of reform and opening up, and its various undertakings 
have been developing rapidly since the Third Plenary Session of 
the 11th CPC Central Committee, and he hopes Guangdong people, 
encouraged by the spirit of the 14th party congress and the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, score 
new and bigger results in the new year. 
  Li Peng, accompanied by Ding Guangen, Fei Xie, and Zhu 
Senlin, toured Huizhou City Industrial Products Exhibition, and 
visited the teachers and students at Huizhou City No. 8 Middle 
School. 
  According to another piece of information, on the afternoon 
of 6 February in Chongqing, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who is 
currently on an inspection trip to Sichuan, convened a forum 
which was attended by the factory heads and managers of nine 
state-run enterprises which are plagued by difficulties. Zhu 
Rongji pointed out that to build a modern system of enterprises, 
the first thing to do is to separate the government from 
enterprises, the government must not be allowed to dictate to 
the enterprises at will, and enterprises must be allowed to make 
their own decisions concerning operation and management, whereas 
when a decision is proved erroneous, the factory manager must be 
held responsible, and such a system must be formed so that staff 
and workers can exercise supervision. The enterprises which 
have debts larger than capital and which are unable to reverse 
the process of making losses should go bankrupt on a trial 
basis; then, reorganization of enterprises will be carried out 
to give them a new life. He also pointed out that to smoothly 
change mechanisms and to be able to maintain social stability, 
it is necessary to carry out reform of the social insurance 
system. 
  Zhu Rongji also said that the difficulties facing state-run 
enterprises are temporary, state-run enterprises have a bright 
future, and the temporary difficulties will surely be solved 
step by step. The method to solve the difficulties rests on the 
state's policy, but mainly rests on enterprises' self-reliance 
and hard work. Enterprises must carry out market research, 
develop new products, strengthen management and operation, 
change operational mechanisms, look at themselves, and demand 
more from themselves. At present, special attention must be 
paid to the life of staff and workers, and efforts must be made 
to protect their basic livelihood and social stability.

  [Text] Beijing, February 9 (XINHUA) -- The 2,700 inmates of 
Beijing No. 2 prison, in an eastern suburb of the capital, are 
today celebrating in their own ways the eve of the Spring 
Festival, China's most important traditional holiday. 
  At 9:30 in the morning, 149 prisoners in a large classroom 
received presents of fruit and light refreshments from the 
prison. 
  They were "well reformed inmates" who were sentenced to more 
than ten years in jail but had not been visited by any family 
members for a long time, or prisoners suffering from bad health, 
said a spokesman for the prison. 
  Wu Zhongjun, 51, was sentenced to 15 years' jail for 
murdering his wife. His two sons had never been to the prison 
to visit him. 
  He sobbed as he held the presents, and said: "I'm grateful 
for the care of the government, and I will reform myself here to 
reduce my prison term." 
  At 10 a.m., another 55 "well reformed inmates" who have 
served more than half their terms were in new clothes and shoes 
which their families had brought them. 
  They were waiting at the reception section for their 
families 
to take them home on parole for the three-day spring festival. 
These "home-leave" prisoners had been selected by the inmates 
themselves for good behavior or meritorious service, said the 
prison spokesman. 
  Prison Deputy-Governor Li Jinghai exhorted them again and 
again at the farewell meeting not to make mistakes or commit any 
crimes and to return to the jail on time. 
  He also warned them not to light fireworks or crackers, 
according to the ban brought in on December 1 last year by the 
Beijing municipal government. 
  "More than 400 inmates of this kind have been granted such 
holidays since 1992," said Li. "No one escaped or committed any 
offences, and all have returned on time." 
  At 11:30, the third batch of 84 well reformed prisoners 
received their family members and dined with them at the 
prison's guest-house. Spouses will be allowed to stay here for 
one day with the prisoners. 
  Wu Duowei, 34, was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment for 
blackmail. His three-year-old son Wu Qiong has not been 
estranged from him, because his wife and the little boy have 
visited him once a month for the past three years. 
  Wu Qiong insisted that his father should feed him at the 
"family dinner." The father, in jail clothes, kisses him from 
time to time. 
  Wu Duowei said the government's permission for his family to 
visit him helped to maintain his family and stabilized his 
spiritual moods during the time of reform. 
  They are staying at the guest-house of the prison. The room 
has been decorated by the pretty wife with colorful balloons. A 
big red Chinese character "fu" or "fortune" poster hangs on the 
wall, which symbolizes good luck in the Chinese tradition, and 
is indispensable on happy occasions. 
  Were it not for the high grey electrified wall outside the 
window, one would not guess one was in a prison. 
  Other prisoners had been granted an additional monthly visit 
by family members, said the prison spokesman, adding that a 
party would be held for the inmates tonight. 
  The Beijing No. 2 Prison, consisting of six prison blocks, 
was built in 1990 at a cost of 52 million yuan (around 9 million 
U.S. dollars then). 
  The prison also has an assembly hall, several reading rooms, 
playgrounds and a guest-house for inmates' families.

<F P=106> ["Notes From the Editors" column by Lin Liangqi: "The `Deng </F>
Whirlwind' Fills China With Vitality"] 
  [Text] This combined issue of "Beijing Review" carries the 
full text of the famous remarks made by Deng Xiaoping during his 
inspection tour of south China in early 1992. The text comes 
from the last essay in the recently published "Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping," Volume III. 
  Reviewing the significant progress China has recorded on 
various fronts over the past two years and a study of the 
important theoretical theses expounded in the remarks on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics was an exercise 
which was indeed close to our hearts. 
  It is common knowledge that Deng Xiaoping is the chief 
architect of China's reform and opening effort which began 15 
years ago. The reform and opening policies have brought 
profound changes to Chinese society. Judging from the overall 
situation, however, prior to 1992 the basic conditions 
concerning China's reform were that the traditional planned 
economic system had broken down and the clue to a viable and 
vigorous new economic structure was visible. This structure, 
however, was far from being fully established. The intricate 
clashes and friction occurring during the transformation from 
the old system to the new became an important root cause for the 
emergence of many contradictions and problems. China's reform 
and opening effort at that time had obviously reached an 
important turning-point which was the focus of discussion both 
at home and abroad. Some expressed worry, others simply sighed 
with sympathy, while still others viewed the situation with a 
critical eye. Several self-proclaimed prophets claimed that 
China's reform and opening cause had collapsed due to the 
setback and was thus doomed to failure. 
  In the spring of 1992, a crucial historical moment, Deng 
Xiaoping journeyed to south China on an inspection tour. The 
ensuing publication of his important remarks, much like a 
southerly, spring breeze instantly replacing the chilling air in 
the late days of winter, injected fresh impetus and vigor into 
China's reform and opening cause. Deng's south China talks 
marked the turning point. China stunned the world with a 
dramatic 12.8 percent increase in gross national product (GNP) 
in 1992, and an even greater increase in the growth 13 percent 
in 1993. While much of the world has been in the grips of an 
economic recession, China's high rate of economic growth over 
the past two years has turned the heads of China watchers 
throughout the world and they now look at the country in 
different terms. 
  People throughout the world marvelled as to how Deng's south 
China remarks have created a so-called Deng whirlwind, a 
whirlwind which thus far has not subsided. In fact, since the 
publication of Deng's south China remarks, China's economy has 
entered a new stage of accelerated development, the enthusiasm 
of the Chinese people for reform and opening has soared to 
unprecedented heights and the face of China has changed 
dramatically. Those who look reality in the face can in no way 
deny the fact that the common understanding reached by the 
Chinese government and the public at large concerning the 
irresistibility of China's reform and opening success is by no 
means a fabricated boast, but instead is an indisputable fact. 
  Why did Deng's south China remarks have such a strong appeal 
and such a profound impetus? By carefully reading the full 
text, one has no difficulty in realizing that the fundamental 
spirit of the remarks lies in an emancipation of the mind, 
seeking truth from fact, and daring to break new ground and 
experimenting to blaze a new trail and initiate new 
undertakings. This, in fact, is the keynote of contemporary 
China; 
  From the outset, the south China remarks established the 
thesis that as "revolution is to liberate productive forces, so 
is reform." This once again clearly defines the nature of reform 
as a revolution, and has thereby once again attracted the 
undivided attention of people from all walks of life and has 
aroused their enthusiasm for participating in reform and opening; 
  In addition, the famous thesis in the south China remarks 
that "a planned economy is not equivalent to socialism, nor is a 
market economy tantamount to capitalism" has guided the Chinese 
people to surmount otherwise puzzling theory and practice, and 
led them to unswervingly proceed with promoting the formation of 
a socialist market economic structure; 
  With regard to the fundamental tasks of socialism and the 
strategic steps required for socialist construction, the most 
appealing theses expounded in the south China remarks were to 
"seize the opportunity for self-development," "development is a 
cardinal principle" and "low-speed equals stagnation and even 
retrogression." These tenets have guided us to place priority on 
the correct emphasis for the tempo of development. They 
represent the theoretical motivation that has helped bring about 
rapid national economic development in China. 
  Both the domestic and foreign mass media believe that Deng's 
south China talks have once again altered the country's outlook 
and have made historic contributions to China's transformation 
from a planned economic system to a market economic structure. 
Just as the Seventh Congress of the Communist Party of China 
(CPC) in 1945 established Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding 
thought and recorded it in Party history, the 14th National 
Congress of the CPC in 1992 completed a scientific appraisal of 
Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and established the strategic task of using the 
theory to arm the mind and unify the thinking of the whole 
Party, while at the same time recording Deng's theory in Party 
history. It was precisely Deng's south China talks that were 
the soul of the 14th National Congress of the CPC. 
  It goes without saying that China will continue to advance 
toward the 21st century along the road guided by Deng's theory. 
People worldwide who hope to gain a profound and accurate 
understanding of China and who hope to feel the pulse of the 
development of China's reform and opening should carefully 
analyze Deng's south China remarks and read other related works.

<F P=106> ["Special Report" by staff reporter Cheng Hsiao-an (6774 </F>
1321 1344): "Huge Portrait of Deng Xiaoping in Shenzhen Has 
Been Replaced With a New One"] 
  [Text] The huge portrait of Deng Xiaoping which stands 
near the Grand Shenzhen Theater in the Shangbu District was 
replaced with a "new one" days ago. According to the Shenzhen 
City CPC Committee propaganda department, replacing the 
propaganda board with Deng Xiaoping's picture with a new one is 
an important official task of the city before the current spring 
festival. This in no way implies that Deng Xiaoping will come 
to south China on an inspection tour again. Some local 
residents were seen standing on the roadside commenting on the 
new picture and the new "quotation from Deng." 
  The new picture still stands at the original place, namely, 
near the Grand Shenzhen Theater where Hongling Road Middle and 
Shennan Road meet and which one must pass when traveling from 
the city to Nantou and Dongguan. The board is five meters tall 
and 20 meters wide. As there is a very big open space around 
the board, one can see it very clearly from the top of a 
building several kilometers away. The new picture of Deng 
Xiaoping is mainly blue, green, and white. Deng's picture 
occupies a prominent position with blue sky and white clouds 
overhead and the Great Wall at the bottom. In the picture, Deng 
Xiaoping is looking at Shenzhen and Dapeng Bay. In the upper 
left corner is a 13-character quotation from Deng which reads: 
"Follow unswervingly the party's basic line for 100 years." 
  Huang Xinhua, deputy chief of the Shenzhen City CPC 
Committee 
propaganda department, said: Putting up a new propaganda board 
does not imply that Deng will make another south China trip. 
Deng is held in high esteem by the citizens in the Shenzhen 
Special Economic Zone. He has been to Shenzhen twice, and this 
reveals his deep concern about Shenzhen's economic development. 
It is annual routine business of the city government to replace 
the old picture with a new one, which carries special 
implications. 
  A local resident, aged over 50, who was passing the picture 
on a bike, said to this reporter: Deng Xiaoping's reform and 
open policies enjoy popular support. It would certainly be a 
good thing if he were to come to Shenzhen again. He, however, 
felt the new picture was not as nice as the old one because in 
the new picture Deng looks older. Another cadre who came to 
Shenzhen from another province on business also said that the 
"new quotation from Deng Xiaoping" is not as good as the old one.

<F P=106> [Dispatch: "Li Peng Inspects Zhuhai and Huizhou"] </F>
  [Text] Zhuhai, 8 Feb (WEN WEI PO) -- During an inspection 
tour of Zhuhai a few days ago, Li Peng, member of the Standing 
Committee of the CPC Central Committee's Political Bureau and 
State Council premier, said that Zhuhai's growth has been rapid. 
Instead of asking the state for money to carry out capital 
construction, Zhuhai has relied on its own efforts to develop a 
lot of basic facilities. This move is correct and it has offered 
a good example to the whole country. 
  Premier Li Peng made an inspection tour of Zhuhai from 29 
January to 4 February. During these seven days, Premier Li Peng 
went to construction sites, enterprises, and the grass-roots 
levels to conduct investigation and study; inspected the 
construction of the Qiao Bridge, the Zhuhai Bridge, the first of 
its kind in southern Guangdong, which was open to traffic by the 
end of last year, the Juren Holdings Company, and Zhuhai's urban 
construction and management; and listened to accounts given by 
the city party secretary and mayor Liang Guangda and other 
leaders. Premier Li Peng was pleased at the results of his 
on-the-spot inspection and the accounts given to him. He fully 
affirmed the work of the city leading body and spoke highly of 
and expressed satisfaction at Zhuhai's economic construction, 
urban building and management, environmental protection, 
hygiene, land management, afforestation, population control, 
social security, and overall administration. Zhuhai is indeed a 
beautiful city. The climate is pleasant and warm as in spring. 
I came here last year. During the current trip, I have 
witnessed the tremendous changes. With its rapid economic 
development and beautiful urban planning, Zhuhai is indeed a 
match for the cities of the developed nations. 
  Through the in-depth inspection of Zhuhai, Premier Li Peng 
said that Zhuhai's reform, opening up, and economic construction 
are successful. He spoke highly of the unremitting efforts made 
by Zhuhai to overcome difficulties and implement the central 
policy of reform and opening up, and the spirit of continuously 
forging ahead and advancing amid storms. He specially presented 
Zhuhai with the poem "Ode to the Bamboo" by Qing poet Zheng 
Qiao: "Taking root in the steep rocks of the mountain, it 
remains firm and strong despite being buffeted by winds from all 
sides." Premier Li Peng encouraged Zhuhai party and government 
leaders and party members to earnestly study Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, make bold 
explorations and practice, and constantly attain new 
achievements in establishing a socialist market economy and 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  Premier Li Peng left Zhuhai for an inspection of Shenzhen on 
the morning of 4 February.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Yin Pinduan (1438 0756 4551) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Sun Yong (1327 0516)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 2 Feb (XINHUA) -- A forum to mark Comrade 
Deng Yingchao's 90th birth anniversary and the publication of 
the Collected Works of Deng Yingchao and In 
Memory of Our Elder Sister Deng was held this afternoon at 
the Great Hall of the People. 
  Those attending the forum included Hu Jintao, Chen Muhua, 
Wang Guangying, Wang Zhaoguo, Zhao Puchu, and Hu Sheng. 
  Li Ruihuan, member of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau Standing Committee and chairman of the National Committee 
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference 
[CPPCC], spoke at the forum. He said: Comrade Deng Yingchao was 
an outstanding woman of the Chinese nation as well as a 
stateswoman and social activist who was widely recognized around 
the world. She made indelible contributions to winning the 
liberation of the Chinese nation and Chinese women, to the 
development of China's socialist modernization, and to opening 
up the socialist path with Chinese characteristics in the new 
period. 
  Li Ruihuan said: During her long revolutionary career, Deng 
Yingchao took part in much important party work, in which she 
made the greatest contributions to Chinese women's liberation 
and the country's united front work. While she was chairman of 
the Sixth CPPCC National Committee, she upheld and refined the 
multiparty cooperation and political consultation system under 
the CPC's leadership; forcefully advocated and promoted the 
workstyle of "political consultation, democratic supervision, 
working in a cooperative spirit, and making friends at home and 
abroad"; and, with the broad vision and personal charisma unique 
to proletarian revolutionaries, united friends of all circles, 
enabling our patriotic united front to continue to gain strength 
and to develop. In dealing with people of all circles, she 
always treated them with sincerity and was always amiable and 
easygoing, enabling her to win everyone's trust and love. 
  Li Ruihuan pointed out: Deng Yingchao was a respectable 
leader of the party and the state as well as an elder sister of 
noble character and high prestige. One can see in her the 
traditional virtues and fine character of the Chinese nation. 
Despite her high position, she never sought personal gain and 
she abided by the party's discipline, was honest in performing 
her official duty, and always regarded serving the people as the 
most important work, maintaining the true quality of a public 
servant. She selflessly dedicated her whole life to the country 
and the people; her spirit of dedication is indelibly engraved 
on the memory of the Chinese people. 
  Huang Qizao, vice president of the All-China Women's 
Federation, said at the forum: During her revolutionary career 
of more than 70 years, Deng Yingchao was full of enthusiasm for 
Chinese women's liberation. As a pioneer and leader of China's 
women's movement, she mobilized, organized, and urged women to 
participate in the revolutionary movement and production and 
construction work; called for the realization of equality 
between men and women, both legally and in real life; and 
repeatedly emphasized the need to protect women's fundamental 
interests and to manifest the principle of the freedom of 
marriage through legislation. She also placed great importance 
on raising women cadres' educational levels and on enhancing 
their skills, and urged governments at all levels to pay 
attention to cultivating and promoting women cadres. She was an 
outstanding representative of the new breed of women brought up 
by the Chinese people's revolution. 
  Also speaking at the forum were Zhao Puchu, Huang Hua, Qian 
Zhengying, and Liu Ying. In their speeches, they recalled with 
deep affection Comrade Deng Yingchao's great contributions, 
praising her as a model communist. Song Ping, Song Renqiong, 
and Ma Wenrui also attended the forum. 
  The forum -- jointly held by the CPPCC National Committee, 
the All-China Women's Federation, and the Central Party 
Literature Research Center -- was presided over by Li Qi, 
adviser to the Central Party Literature Research Center.

<F P=106> ["Feature" by XINHUA correspondent Su Kuoshan (5685 2368 </F>
0810) and XINHUA reporter Zhou Zhifang (0719 1807 2455): "A 
Long Sword and Two Stars Soar Into the Southern Skies -- An 
Eyewitness Account of the Launching of Our Country's New Carrier 
Rocket"] 
  [Text] Xichang, 8 Feb (XINHUA) -- On the afternoon of 8 
February, a brand-new rocket sat bolt upright next to a gigantic 
launch tower at the Xichang Satellite Launch Center. Its white 
body, emblazoned with a bright-red drawing of the national flag 
and the characters "China Aerospace," glistened in the bright 
afternoon sunlight. 
  This was the Long March 3-A, a new type of carrier rocket 
developed by our country scheduled to be launched soon. Inside 
the cowling at the tip of the rocket were a space survey 
satellite codenamed "Shijian-4" and a simulated satellite a 
total of 52.52 meters high. The new rocket is a single-body, 
three-stage, heavy-thrust carrier rocket developed on the basis 
of the "Long March-3." It is capable of lifting a 2.5-tonne 
payload into geosynchronous orbit around the earth. 
  At 1530 [0730 GMT], the first long wail of the siren pierced 
the sky. The launch site was unusually quiet, except for the 
commands transmitted through the loudspeaker and the noise 
caused by liquid hydrogen and oxygen burning in the combustion 
pond. 
  The vast blue sky was cloudless. The row of huge slogans at 
the bottom of the launch tower was exceptionally striking: Each 
and every screw links up to form the space industry, whereas 
small buttons hold the motherland's dignity together. 
  At 1615, commander No. 1 issued a command: "We have entered 
a 20-minute state of readiness. Only one of the five work 
platforms on the tower is not yet open. The last stage of 
fueling is in full swing. The work platform, which ran 
parallel to the cowling, spewed white clouds of smoke generated 
by the fueling process. [no closing quotation marks as received] 
  Thereafter, commander No. 1 ordered operator No. 301 to 
leave 
the site and to enter a five-minute state of readiness for the 
launch. The siren sounded for a fourth time, and the last group 
of people on the tower ran away from the launch site. 
  At 1634, a loud sound rattled the entire valley as the Long 
March 3-A emitted a huge, bright orange plume from its rear 
portion. The launch site was filled with smoke as the white 
body of the rocket lifted off into the cloudless sky. Scores of 
fluorescent screens kept flickering on the work counters in the 
room of the command and control center. The gigantic main 
display screen illustrated the rocket's path. Data relayed from 
the Xian Satellite Monitoring and Control Center and the 
Yuanwang survey ship in the Pacific Ocean showed that the 
satellites had entered geosynchronous orbit with the earth. 
  At 1717, a responsible person from the China Aerospace 
Industry Corporation proclaimed: The experiment of the Long 
March 3-A's maiden flight is successful. The room was filled 
with joy. Bursts of firecrackers erupted outside the room, 
greeting the successful launch and bringing in the Spring 
Festival.

<F P=106> [China Daily Commentaries: "New Nuclear Plant"] </F>
  [Text] The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant has started 
commercial operation. This event marks another step forward in 
the development of China's nuclear power industry. It will send 
electricity to Hong Kong in addition to greatly easing power 
shortages in Guangdong Province. 
  The Daya Bay plant is China's second nuclear power station. 
The Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant in East China's Zhejiang 
Province began operation in 1991. 
  Daya Bay is China's first large-scale nuclear power station 
that makes use of foreign investment, sophisticated foreign 
equipment and advanced technology. This would have been 
impossible without the reform and opening policy. 
  The question of safety is the people's primary concern. From 
its design through construction, trial and commercial operation, 
the Daya Bay plant has observed all requirements of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency and has passed several of its 
examinations. Residents in nearby regions can trust the safety 
reassurances made by experts, both Chinese and foreign, who work 
at the Daya Bay plant and whose families live nearby. 
  Though China is rich in energy resources, the distribution 
is 
poorly balanced. Shortages of energy are becoming a bottleneck 
to economic development, especially in coastal southeast China. 
  So far, nuclear energy, the cleanest, safest and most 
economical source, constitutes only 1 per cent of China's energy 
production. This means that there is vast potential as well as 
urgent need for future development. 
  The Daya Bay project has, among other achievements, provided 
experience and trained personnel for nuclear power production. 
It has also set an example of successful international 
co-operation. 
  All this surely will have very favourable effects on the 
further expansion of China's nuclear industry.

  [Text] Yesterday afternoon, more than 80 leading comrades 
from party, government, and Army organizations in Guangzhou 
gathered at the Zhudao Guest House of the provincial party 
committee to attend a party. On the occasion of celebrating the 
forthcoming Spring Festival, they talked freely, reviewing the 
achievements made in reform, opening up, and the development of 
the two civilizations, and airing their views on double-support 
work. 
  Provincial party committee Secretary Xie Fei; Lieutenant 
General Li Xilin, commander of the Guangzhou Military Region; 
Lieutenant General Shi Yuxiao, political commissar of the 
Guangzhou Military Region; and Guangdong Governor Zhu Senlin 
delivered speeches at the get-together. 
  Comrade Xie Fei said: Guangdong Province has achieved great 
success in double-support work, and is bound to make greater 
progress in the new year. This is because the Army units and 
local authorities share same objectives and interests: To 
strive for the motherland's prosperity and to defend it against 
foreign bullying and humiliation. Xie Fei noted: The 
harmonious relations between the Army units and the government, 
and between the Army units and the public in Guangdong Province 
should be attributed the fact that the leadership of the Army 
units in the Guangzhou Military Region has set great store by 
the work in this regard. It is hoped that in the new year the 
Army units, the government, and the public can communicate with 
each other better, and can help each other. Comrade Xie Fei 
suggested that the three sides join to study the possibility of 
running some practical, constructive projects this year so as to 
further strengthen solidarity between the Army and the 
government, and between the Army and the masses. 
  Lieutenant General Shi Yuxiao, political commissar of the 
Guangzhou Military Region, highly appreciated Guangdong 
Province's performance in the drive to support the Army and give 
preferential treatment to families of martyrs and servicemen. 
He disclosed that the funds Guangdong Province appropriated 
only to finance the operation of local Army units last year 
totaled 162 million yuan. On behalf of the Army units stationed 
in Guangdong, he expressed heartfelt thanks to the party and 
government organs at all levels, as well as the people of 
Guangdong Province.

party committee and government held a forum for provincial 
party, government, and military leaders, leaders of the armed 
forces units stationed in Hunan, leaders of the Changsha City 
CPC Committee, and comrades in charge of the relevant provincial 
departments. They gathered to discuss the close relations 
between soldiers and civilians, as well as double-support work. 
  Provincial party Secretary Wang Maolin chaired and addressed 
the forum. He said: Hunan was an important place of origin for 
the founding of the Chinese armed forces and was the native 
place of our great leader, Chairman Mao. It has always had the 
fine tradition of supporting the Army and giving preferential 
treatment to the families of soldiers and martyrs, and of 
supporting the government and cherishing the people. Both in 
the revolutionary war years and in the period of peaceful 
construction, the Hunan people have united with the People's 
Army, shared weal and woe with it, and established deep feelings 
with it. In recent years, officers and soldiers stationed in 
Hunan have developed the fine tradition of supporting the 
government and cherishing the people, have taken an active part 
in the province's spiritual and material civilizations, and have 
made major contributions to maintaining social order, providing 
relief aid to disaster-stricken areas, helping the poor, 
carrying out key construction projects, and invigorating Hunan. 
Wang Maolin stressed these three points: First, double-support 
work should be taken as a major matter that has an important 
bearing on the overall situation and should be done well. 
Second, focusing on economic construction, we should carry out 
double-support work and the activity of building civilized units 
and villages. Third, it is necessary to serve the construction 
of the armed forces wholeheartedly. 
  Provincial party deputy secretary and Governor Chen Bangzhu 
also spoke at the forum.

  [Text] On 5 February, the provincial party committee and 
the provincial government held a forum on the work of supporting 
the Army and giving preferential treatment to family members of 
revolutionary martyrs and servicemen and supporting the 
government and cherishing the people. [hereafter called the 
"double-support work" for short] 
  Sun Weiben, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
pointed out at the forum that the double-support work should be 
carried out frequently, creatively, sincerely, and genuinely. 
On 5 February, representatives of related party, government, 
and military organizations met together at the Provincial Heping 
Assembly Hall to speak glowingly of the province's excellent 
situation in the double-support work as well as the 
fish-and-water relationship between the Army and the government 
and between the Army and the people. 
  Representatives participating in the forum maintained: Over 
the past year, the province as a whole has extensively conducted 
the national defense education by conscientiously implementing 
the guidelines of the national double-support work conference, 
has done a good job in giving special care to disabled 
servicemen and to family members of revolutionary martyrs and 
servicemen, has achieved great results in the activities of 
Army-civilian joint construction and joint education, has 
vigorously developed the activities of building double-support 
model cities, and achieved satisfying results in the 
double-support work. 
  Sun Weiben pointed out in his speech: The double-support 
work 
contains an extremely extensive content. Under the new 
historical conditions, the double-support work will witness new 
circumstances and new problems. This requires us to carry out 
the work in a regular and creative manner. In doing this work, 
we should also express sincerity and genuineness. The Army 
should sincerely and genuinely show concern for and support the 
construction of localities, and the localities should sincerely 
and genuinely support the Army by carrying forward the glorious 
tradition of supporting the Army and giving preferential 
treatment to family members of revolutionary martyrs and 
servicemen. 
  Shan Rongfan, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee, highly appraised the achievements scored by the 
province in the double-support work in 1993 and called for 
efforts to further enhance the understanding of the importance 
of the double-support work, to strengthen the propaganda on the 
double-support work, to implement existing rules, regulations, 
and policies related to the double-support work, and to 
consolidate the already achieved results. 
  Yu Jingchang, standing committee member of the provincial 
party committee and political commissar of the provincial 
military district, and (Yan Haipeng), deputy political commissar 
of a certain combined arms Army stationed in Harbin, also spoke 
at the forum.

  [Text] Chengdu, February 8 (XINHUA) -- Vice-Premier Zhu 
Rongji has toured southwest China's Sichuan Province, where he 
saw local party and government leaders and retired cadres, 
visited research institutions and factories and attended a 
seminar of factories in difficulty. 
  Zhu, member of the Standing Committee of the Political 
Bureau 
of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, praised 
Sichuan for its achievements in various sectors and its efforts 
to properly handle the relations between the reforms, 
development and stability. 
  On January 6, Zhu paid a visit to the Chongqing No.1 Textile 
Mill, where he called a meeting of nine enterprises in 
difficulty to discuss with them how to end their plight. 
  Zhu Rongji said that the establishment of a modern 
enterprise 
system required that the government kept its hands off 
enterprises, allowing them to enjoy decision-making powers and 
managers to bear full responsibility for their decisions. 
  He said that for enterprises which continually suffer losses 
and cannot pay their debts, an experimental bankruptcy policy 
can be applied so as to reorganize them. 
  He also stressed the importance of reforming the social 
security system so that the enterprises can smoothly transform 
their system and maintain stability. 
  He urged managers and directors to overcome their 
difficulties mainly on their own by developing new products and 
studying the market, improving management and transforming the 
operational system. 
  He called on them to show more concern for the living of 
their employees.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Wu Yunhe: "Reports Bode Brisk Economy in </F>
1st Quarter"] 
  [Text] China's economic performance will remain brisk 
during the first quarter of this year, the State Information 
Centre predicts. 
  Industrial production from January through March is expected 
to grow rapidly, just as it did in the previous three months, 
said a report released by the centre, which is under the State 
Planning Commission. 
  Retail sales will continue to be vigorous, while prices of 
consumer goods on the domestic market will also continue to 
rise, according to the report. 
  But because of the government's strict control over the 
banks' monetary supply, investment in the country's fixed assets 
is expected to experience a sluggish period during the first 
three months of this year. 
  The centre's economists also predict that China's trade 
deficit with foreign countries will be smaller than last year's. 
  This is partly attributed to the unification of the 
dual-rate 
monetary system, which effectively raises the import cost for 
Chinese companies. 
  The report predicts that during the first quarter of this 
year, the country's industrial output value will be 22 percent 
greater than during the same period last year. 
  Retail prices will be 14.5 percent higher in the first three 
months of this year than they were during the same period last 
year, the report predicts. Gross retail sales will show a 28.6 
percent jump during the same period. 
  Analysts say the recent New Year holiday and the coming 
Spring Festival are two major factors spurring consumer buying. 
Factory managers will, no doubt, be enthusiastic to gear up 
their production to meet the increased demand. 
  Other culprits stirring up the prices of consumer products 
include salary raises for State units' employees and the 
government's gradual decontrol over prices of China's crude oil 
and oil products, the report added. 
  Investment in capital construction at State units during the 
first quarter this year is expected to increase by 36 percent 
over that of the same period last year. 
  At a national banking conference in January this year, the 
People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, announced it 
will strictly control the banks' lending quotas, particularly 
for investments in fixed assets. 
  During the first quarter of this year, investment in 
technology upgrades by State units is expected to be only 40 
percent greater than that during the same period last year.

  [Text] Beijing, February 8 (XINHUA) -- Seventy-seven out of 
every 100 urban homes in China had a TV set by early last year, 
while 55.3 had refrigerators and a massive 85.4 had washing 
machines. 
  These striking figures, just released by the Ministry of 
Domestic Trade, illustrate the rise in the standards of 
consumption as urban residents' incomes have risen. 
  The ministry figures show that actual consumption of urban 
residents grew on average by 5.4 percent annually during the 
1980-1993 period, compared with 2.2 percent during 26 years 
before reform and opening up. 
  In 1993, per capita living cost of urban residents reached 
about 1,700 yuan (213 U.S. dollars) annually. 
  Experts said that China's consumption pattern experienced 
three stages since the reform and opening up. First, daily 
necessities during the 1979-1984 period, then durable goods 
during the 1984-1991 period, and in the 1990s, families had more 
money to spare for improving the quality of their life such as 
housing, entertainment, travel and culture consumption. 
  In detail, in the 1960s and 1970s, the residents' targets 
were items such as bikes, sewing machines and watches. In the 
1980s they were color TV sets, refrigerators and washing 
machines. 
  The figures show that by the first half of 1993, every 100 
urban households had 77 color TV sets, 85.4 washing machines and 
55.3 refrigerators. 
  Now, durable goods such as telephones, air conditioners, 
pianos and personal computers can be found in some well-off 
homes. 
  Housing conditions of urban residents have also greatly 
improved. In 1993, urban residents spent more on home 
decorating, up by 35 percent over 1992. 
  Residents now have more varieties of non-staple food within 
their reach. In 1993, per capita consumption of meat, including 
pork, beef and mutton, showed an increase of 60.4 percent over 
1978, while that of eggs and fresh-water fish increased by 160 
percent and 17.1 percent respectively. 
  Now residents spend more money than before on clothing. They 
aim for high-grade garments and fashionable clothing.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Control over Fixed-Assets </F>
Investment Is of Central Relevance"] 
  [Text] Seizing the opportunity, deepening reforms, 
expanding opening up, promoting development, and maintaining 
stability together make up the framework for this year's party's 
work. Last year we conscientiously implemented central plans on 
strengthening macroregulation and control, centralized actions, 
worked concertedly, and achieved positive results in solving 
outstanding contradictions and problems caused by rapid economic 
development. For this year, strengthening macroregulation and 
control over fixed-assets investment and strictly controlling 
the scale of infrastructure projects will be the two most 
important areas of work in service of the overall endeavor. 
  Judging from last year, when excessively rapid growth in 
investment resulted in credit and monetary crunches, shortages 
of transport, energy, and raw materials, and triggered off new 
debt deferrals and defaults, if the growth of fixed-assets 
investment is not put under strict control this year, all 
sectors will be stretched to their limits, which will lead 
eventually to drastic fluctuations in the national economy. If 
that happens, this will work against the smooth implementation 
of many reformist measures this year, healthy economic 
development, the effort to curb inflation, and expanding opening 
up, and will cause us to lose the historic opportunity we often 
talk about. We can say that strict controls over the scale of 
fixed-assets investment is the key to the smooth implementation 
of this year's reforms, healthy economic development, social 
stability, and curbing inflation. 
  Strengthening macroregulation and control does not mean 
halting development and doing away with the market economy. It 
is wrong to set macroregulation and control against the market 
economy or economic development. We must not think that 
strengthening macroregulation and control necessarily means a 
slowing down of economic development, or vice versa. Only under 
effective state macroregulation and control can the market 
economy properly play its vital role of allocating resources and 
ensuring the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the 
national economy. No market economy in any country in the world 
today is not under government regulation and control. Under the 
new pattern of multiple investment bodies and diversified 
financing, it is highly necessary to not only promptly 
strengthen macroregulation and control, but also to exercise 
macroregulation and control over investment with economic, 
legal, and essential administrative means. 
  To establish a restraining and risk mechanism for 
fixed-assets investment, the central authorities have decided 
that, as of this year, the scale of loans for infrastructure 
facilities and key industrial infrastructure projects will be 
put under the centralized arrangements of the newly established 
State Development Bank. This is an important reform, but it is 
not possible to immediately put the scale of investment under 
control with the new mechanism. Therefore, in view of the 
present situation, it is still necessary to adopt multiple 
methods simultaneously: First, the focus of work must be 
genuinely shifted to structural adjustment and raising 
efficiency. It is absolutely impermissible to again make the 
same mistake of single-mindedly competing for investment, 
launching projects, and expanding the scale in defiance of 
objective conditions. Localities and departments must all adopt 
effective measures to strengthen macroregulation and control 
over investment and to concentrate their financial powers and 
materials on key projects. Second, reprioritize projects under 
construction to ensure that key projects are completed. 
Projects completed and key operational support projects, 
infrastructure facilities, and infrastructure industrial 
projects must also obey state centralized planning and rational 
layout, observe the principle of high rates of efficiency and 
working within one's ability, concentrate on one single project 
at a time, and avoid blind and repetitive projects. Third, 
prevent continued expansion of the scale of construction, 
strictly scrutinize new projects, and hold the units and leaders 
concerned accountable for construction work launched without 
authorization. Fourth, strengthen controls over the supply of 
funds. Tighten the management of credit for fixed-assets 
investment. The banking sector must strictly enforce the 
investment loan plan, and financial institutions are forbidden 
from lending for fixed-assets investment with funds obtained 
from bank discounts. Fifth, strengthen the standardized 
management of the capital market. The scale of bond issues and 
the scope of joint-stock experiments cannot be expanded without 
proper authorization. Sixth, tighten the management of property 
developments and development zones, incorporating investment in 
and loans for property development and construction into the 
state fixed-assets investment and loan plan. Also, we must 
strengthen guidance and standardized management of projects 
funded by direct foreign investment, and genuinely strengthen 
leadership over macroregulation and control over investment. 
  Reform and development this year has a heavy agenda. It is 
highly significant to pursue this year's economic work well. 
Therefore, we must comprehensively and correctly analyze the 
times and the situation and exploit them, be clear-headed, good 
at promptly identifying and solving new problems caused by 
progress, particularly prevent an expansion of investments, 
genuinely strengthen macroregulation and control over 
investment, and create even more favorable conditions for 
reform, development, and stability.

<F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Close To 9,500 Firms Adopt Share Holding </F>
Form"] 
  [Text] Almost 9,500 companies last year were set up 
adopting some form of share-holding system, in the hope of 
improving their management. 
  Official sources say the share-holding system's vigorous 
development in 1993 was prompted by deepening economic reform. 
  Of the total, the share-holding companies limited accounted 
for 2,968; the liability limited companies made up 6,472; and 
there were 1,776 other firms who also issued shares to their 
employees but not officially considered share-holding companies. 
  According to the China Securities Regulatory Commission, at 
least 13,000 companies have taken up the share-holding system. 
  By the end of 1993, 122 companies had been successfully 
listed at securities exchanges, with their gross capital stock 
registered at 208.6 billion yuan ($24.3 billion). 
  Meanwhile, China also saw its six biggest enterprises listed 
on international securities exchanges. 
  Analysts say central government was initially successful in 
developing the securities market and strengthening people's 
investment sense. 
  Official figures show China now has at least 51 securities 
underwriting institutions. It also has more than 25 million 
share-holders. 
  The Shanghai Securities Exchange in East China and the 
Shenzhen Securities Exchange in South China have already become 
the barometer of the latest developments in the country's 
share-holding system. 
  More than 123 share issues were traded at the Shanghai 
Securities Exchange last year. 
  Of which, there were 101 A share issues and 22 B share 
issues. 
  And the Shenzhen Securities Exchange handled transactions of 
at least 92 issues, 79 per cent which were A shares. 
  Official figures also show that in 1993 A share transactions 
totalled 13.27 trillion yuan ($1.5 trillion). 
  Meanwhile, the gross market value of the traded B shares 
amounted to 77.3 billion yuan ($8.89 billion) in foreign 
exchange. 
  In 1993, computerized Securities Trading Automated 
Quotations 
System (Staq) also played a role in developing corporate bonds. 
  There were 17 corporate bonds listed last year. Of which, 58 
per cent were traded under the Staq system, while the country's 
National Electronic Trading System (Net) handled the rest of the 
corporate bond trade. 
  The total transaction value of the corporate bonds through 
these computerized systems in China reached more than 7.5 
billion yuan ($872 million) in 1993.
