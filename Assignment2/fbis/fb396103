  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 17 (CNA) -- Two-way trade between 
Taiwan and Europe totaled US$26.44 billion in 1993, up 0.1 
percent from the previous year, the Taipei-based Euro-Asia Trade 
Organization (EATO) reported Thursday. 
  Taiwan's exports to Europe fell 7.5 percent to US$12.88 
billion, while imports grew 8.7 percent to US$13.56 billion, 
thereby resulting in a deficit of US$680 million for Taiwan. 
  This is the first time in two decades that Taiwan has 
registered a trade imbalance with Europe. 
  Officials said that economic sluggishness in European 
countries last year adversely affected Taiwan's trade promotion 
there. Increasing purchases by Taiwan companies were also to 
blame for the deficit, they added. 
  Europe, however, remained one of Taiwan's major trading 
partners, with the island's shipments to Europe in 1993 
accounting for 15.2 percent of Taiwan's aggregate exports and 
European imports making up for 17.6 percent of the total. 
  EATO statistics show that trade with Germany, Britain, 
Holland, France, and Italy made up 70.4 percent of Taiwan's 
total trade with Europe. 
  Taiwan's trade with Germany rose 2.7 percent to US$7.72 
billion last year, but trade with Britain fell 5.7 percent to 
US$3.34 billion. 
  The officials pointed to closer trade ties between Taiwan 
and 
Europe, noting that cooperation between the two sides will 
certainly be strengthened as Taiwan enterprises have been 
seeking to enter into strategic business alliances with their 
European counterparts. 
  In 1993, strategic alliances with Europe were signed with 
Philips Co. of Holland and ABB of Sweden.

  [Text] London, Feb. 16 (CNA) -- The Central Bank of China 
(CBC) opened a representative office in London Wednesday as part 
of its effort to promote financial exchanges between Taiwan and 
European countries. 
  CBC Governor Samuel Shieh flew to London earlier this week 
to 
preside over the opening ceremony. Many British politicians, 
bankers and business executives, including former Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher and the deputy governor of the Bank of 
England, attended the ceremony. 
  The new CBC office is located in London's financial district 
and adjacent to the Bank of England. It is the CBC's second 
overseas office. The bank opened a similar office in New York 
last year. 
  The office will help manage CBC's foreign exchange deposits 
in Britain and other European countries as well as strengthen 
contacts with major British and other European banks, said Yang 
Chin-lung, director of the London office. 
  London is one of the world's most important financial 
capitals. "Our London office is expected to help train qualified 
international money managers and accelerate Taiwan's financial 
liberalization and internationalization," Yang added. 
  With the addition of the CBC office, Taiwan now has six 
financial institutions in Britain. The Taiwan provincial 
government-owned First and Chang Hua Commercial Banks have 
opened branches in London. The Bank of Taiwan, Hua Nan 
Commercial Bank and Chinatrust Commercial Bank have 
representative offices here. Meanwhile, Taipei Bank is 
scheduled to open a representative office in London in March.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 17 (CNA) -- Taiwan imported 134,096 
kilograms of gold in 1993, down 24.54 percent compared to 
177,711 kilograms imported in 1992, a spokesman for the World 
Gold Council's Taipei Liaison Office said Wednesday. 
  Gold bullion accounted for 129,639 kilograms of the imports, 
followed by 1,858 kilograms of gold coins, the spokesman said. 
  In 1992, he noted, Taiwan imported 174,603 kilograms of 
bullion and 2,813 kilograms of gold coin. 
  The World Gold Council attributed the decreasing imports to 
declining prices in international markets, which in turn 
affected people's willingness to hold gold, the spokesman said. 
  The Geneva-based World Gold Council was established in 1986 
to promote global trade in gold investment and ornaments as well 
as in industrial usage. 
  The Taiwan Liaison Office was set up in 1992, bringing the 
number of council offices to around 20, the spokesman said.

<F P=106> [Article by Yu Youxian (0060 0645 0341): "Adhering to the </F>
Theory of `Grasping With Both Hands' To Promote the Healthy 
Development of the Press and Publication Sector"] 
  [Text] I. 
  The necessity of adhering to the principle of grasping with 
both hands in the course of socialist modernization is an 
important part of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  In Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, there are many important expositions on "grasping 
with both hands and grasping firmly with both hands." For 
example: "We are building two civilizations. One is material 
civilization and the other is spiritual civilization." ("Speak 
With Facts"); "In the four modernizations, we must grasp with 
both hands and it will not do to grasp with only one hand. 
Grasping with both hands means grasping construction with one 
hand and grasping the legal system with the other." ("Speech at 
the Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of 
the Central Committee"); "In a socialist country, a genuine 
Marxist political party must, after becoming the ruling party, 
devote itself to developing the productive forces, and on this 
basis gradually improving the people's living standards. This is 
the building of material civilization. For quite a long period 
in the past, we overlooked the development of the productive 
forces. Therefore, at present, we have to pay special attention 
to the building of material civilization. At the same time, we 
also have to build socialist spiritual civilization. The most 
fundamental thing is to enable the broad masses of people to 
have communist ideals, morals, and culture, and to observe 
discipline." ("Build Socialist Material Civilization and 
Spiritual Civilization"); "It is necessary to persist in 
grasping with both hands. It is necessary to grasp reform and 
opening up with one hand and to grasp cracking down on various 
kinds of criminal activities with the other. Both hands should 
grasp firmly." ("Gists of Remarks Made in Wuchang, Shenzhen, 
Zhuhai, and Shanghai") These expositions on grasping material 
civilization with one hand while grasping spiritual civilization 
with the other, grasping economic construction with one hand 
while grasping democracy and the legal system with the other, 
grasping reform and opening up with one hand while grasping 
cracking down on crimes with the other shine with the 
ideological brilliance of dialectical materialism. All things 
in the world are interrelated and interdependent. This is 
particularly true of a series of major issues we meet with in 
the course of socialist modernization. For example, persisting 
in reform and opening must be closely combined with persisting 
in cracking down on criminal activities. If we do not severely 
punish criminals committing economic crimes and other criminal 
offenses or do not strengthen the building of honest 
administration, reform and opening up will be seriously 
interfered with. On the other hand, if we do not carry out 
reform and opening up, do not greatly increase the country's 
comprehensive strength and raise the cultural level of society, 
or do not improve the people's living standards, we cannot 
thoroughly do away with various criminal activities or 
corruption. Upholding grasping with both hands and grasping 
firmly with both hands means upholding the doctrine that 
everything has two aspects in the theory of knowledge in 
dialectical materialism. In the process of modernization, we 
must uphold the doctrine that everything has two aspects 
advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. Only in this way can we 
handle various kinds of complicated issues and contradictions 
dialectically and in an all-round manner and make fewer mistakes 
or detours in our work. 
  The building of material civilization and the building of 
spiritual civilization are mutually conditional and promote one 
another. The building of material civilization is the 
foundation of the building of spiritual civilization. We must 
firmly grasp the center of economic construction and should not 
let go our hold. "Not upholding socialism, not carrying out 
reform and opening up, not developing the economy, and not 
improving the people's standard of living can only be a blind 
alley." ("Gists of Remarks Made in Wuchang, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, 
and Shanghai") All comrades engaged in the building of 
spiritual civilization should firmly establish the idea of 
serving economic construction, reform, and opening up. Only by 
correctly locating our position of serving economic 
construction, reform, and opening up can we realize the value of 
our work. In his important remarks made during his inspection 
tour of the south, Comrade Deng Xiaoping scientifically put 
forward the standard for assessing the correctness of the work 
in economic construction, reform, and opening up: We "should 
mainly see whether or not it is conducive to developing the 
productive forces of the socialist society, whether or not it is 
conducive to increasing the comprehensive national strength of 
the socialist state, and whether or not it is conducive to 
improving the people's living standards." Undoubtedly, this is 
also the only correct standard for assessing the building of 
socialist spiritual civilization. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always stressed that the building 
of socialist material civilization and the building of spiritual 
civilization should be grasped simultaneously and has attached 
great importance to the special role played by socialist 
spiritual civilization in modernization. As early as the 
beginning of reform and opening up, Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
pointed out: "While building a high degree of material 
civilization, we should raise the level of science and culture 
of the entire nation, develop a noble, rich, and colorful 
cultural life, and build a high degree of socialist spiritual 
civilization." ("Congratulatory Speech at the Fourth Congress 
of the Literature and Art workers of China") Comrade Xiaoping 
also said: "The most fundamental thing in building socialist 
spiritual civilization is to enable the broad masses of people 
to have ideals, morals, and culture, and to observe discipline." 
("Build Socialist Materialist Civilization and Spiritual 
Civilization") Grasping the building of material civilization 
and spiritual civilization with both hands is a prominent 
characteristic in the socialist modernization of our country. 
Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "If the building of spiritual 
civilization is not strengthened, the building of material 
civilization will be damaged and we shall make detours. We 
cannot succeed in our revolution or construction by depending on 
material conditions alone." ("Speech at the CPC National 
Congress") 
  The historical experience of reform and opening up in the 
past 10 years and more have repeatedly proved that whenever we 
adhere to the principle of "grasping with both hands and 
grasping firmly with both hands" which Comrade Xiaoping has 
always stressed, the cause of socialist modernization will 
become more prosperous every day and will develop smoothly, and 
whenever we deviate from this basic principle and whenever we 
make the mistake of grasping firmly with one hand while relaxing 
the grasp of the other, the cause of socialist modernization 
will be interfered with and damaged. We must keep firmly in 
mind Comrade Deng Xiaoping's earnest instructions, learn from 
past experience and lessons, and ensure the healthy and steady 
development of the cause of socialist modernization. 
<H6>  II. </H6>
  Press and publication work is an important part of the 
building of socialist spiritual civilization. Doing a good job 
in press and publication work has an important bearing on 
properly carrying out the building of the two civilizations. 
The press and publication sector has the mass media in its 
hands. In a modern society, it plays a specially important role 
in spreading information, promoting the development of the 
economy, science, and culture, forming public opinion, winning 
people's support, and stabilizing the social and political 
situation. Without powerful and efficient information- 
spreading systems and without public opinion for guiding society 
which is in line with the direction of development of 
modernization, it is difficult to imagine the possibility of 
attaining success in modernization. Comrade Xiaoping once said: 
"Strengthening the party's leadership over the ideological front 
and overcoming the weak and lax situation have become a pressing 
task of the whole party. In addition to the theoretical and 
literature and art circles, education, the press, publication, 
radio, television, mass culture, mass ideological and political 
work, and other sectors also have similar or other pressing 
problems to solve. The work of the entire ideological front 
needs to be strengthened. We should solemnly put this question 
before the whole party and on the important agenda of the CPC 
Central Committee and local CPC committees at all levels. After 
the center of work has been shifted to economic construction, 
the whole party should study how to adapt itself to the new 
conditions, strengthen the party's ideological work, and guard 
against the tendency of immersing ourselves in economic work and 
ignoring ideological work." ("The Party's Pressing Tasks on the 
Organizational Front and the Ideological Front") These 
instructions of Comrade Xiaoping have great significance in 
giving guidance. Press and publication work can only be 
strengthened and should not be weakened. This has been proved 
by the practice of many years. At present, there are across the 
country more than 500 publishing houses, 200 audio-video 
publishing houses, 2,000 newspapers, and 7,000 magazines. In 
addition, there are more than 100,000 points and networks for 
selling books and magazines and 4,000 printing houses with 
regular customers. Since the press and publication industry is 
developing so rapidly and its scale is so big, only by giving it 
correct guidance and exercising efficient management will it be 
possible for it to develop healthily and to provide a powerful 
spiritual propelling force, intellectual support, a public 
opinion environment, and an ideological guarantee for reform, 
opening up, and economic construction. This is an important 
issue which has a bearing on the success of modernization. 
Comrade Xiaoping has put forward, precisely at this high 
strategic level, the necessity of regarding the strengthening of 
the work of the ideological front, including press and 
publication, as a very pressing task of the whole party. 
Comrades working on the press and publication front must 
seriously understand the earnest hope of Comrade Xiaoping, work 
hard, explore boldly, and go all out to fulfill their duties. 
CPC committees and governments at all levels should also 
strengthen at this high strategic level press and publication 
work and the building of the press and publication organizations 
and workers so that the party can really exercise leadership 
over press and publication work. 
  In the course of the gradual establishment of the socialist 
market economy structure, the core of strengthening the 
management of press and publication lies in strengthening the 
legal system and strictly carrying out management according to 
law. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "It is especially necessary 
to grasp legislation work firmly, including the legislation of 
laws and regulations governing rallies, societies, parades, 
demonstrations, the press, and publication." ("China Brooks No 
Chaos") To speed up legislation on the press and publication is 
the most urgent task in press and publication work at present. 
We should seriously study new situations and new problems 
emerging in the press and publication under the conditions of 
the socialist market economy, extensively solicit the views of 
various circles in society, and speed up the drafting of the 
"Publication Law" and the "Journalism Law." At the same time, 
we should also speed up the formulation of regulations and rules 
concerning the press and publication and strive to raise the 
level of the legal system for the management of the press and 
publication. We should, through strengthening management 
according to law, make due contributions to maintaining the 
normal operation of the press and publication and to social 
stability. Publications, published legally or illegally, which 
are found to have serious political mistakes, to be harmful to 
nationality solidarity, to violate foreign policies, to 
propagate pornography, or to be vulgar, will often become 
factors causing social instability and will interfere with the 
overall situation of economic construction, reform, and opening 
up. Regarding such publications, we should, on the one hand, 
strive to take preventive measures, and, on the other hand, mete 
out stern punishment according to law in order to put an end to 
the recurrence of similar problems. 
  The press and publication is an important part of the 
party's 
ideological work and is also a rising industry of the national 
economy system. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out that "development 
is the last word [fa zhan cai shi ying dao li 4099 1455 2088 
2508 4289 6670 3810]." Under the historical conditions of the 
gradual establishment of the socialist market economy structure, 
development and prosperity are also the last word of the press 
and publication. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC 
Central Committee, the reform of the press and publication has 
taken a very big step forward and its operation and management 
level has risen greatly. Most publishing houses have changed 
from being of a production type to being of a 
production-management type. In the sales link, the requirements 
of "one main body, three multiples, and one fewer" (the 
state-owned Xinhua Bookstore as the main body; multiple 
channels, multiple economic compositions, and multiple 
purchasing and marketing forms; and fewer circulation links) and 
"one delegate, two removes, and one cooperation" (delegate power 
to invigorate state-owned bookstores; remove restrictions on 
wholesale channels to invigorate the book and magazine market 
and remove restrictions on purchasing and marketing forms and 
sales discounts to invigorate the purchasing and marketing 
mechanism; and strive to develop lateral cooperation) are 
gradually being satisfied. In the course of technical 
transformation, more and more book, newspaper, and magazine 
publishing enterprises are using the technology of "laser 
photo-typing, electronic scanning, offset printing, and 
automatic binding." The era of "lead and fire" has basically 
ended in the printing of newspapers of party committees at the 
prefectural and city levels and above. All this has been 
brought about by reform and opening up and is the result of 
great efforts made by the party and the government in developing 
the press and publication. At a time when reform and opening up 
have entered a new stage of historical development, there is 
still much work to do to deepen reform and speed up development. 
For example, further efforts are needed in the reform of the 
operation and management structure of publishing houses, 
newspapers, and magazines; further efforts are needed in the 
implementation of the director responsibility system in 
publishing houses; further efforts are needed to study how to 
establish and improve the book and magazine management structure 
and the mechanism to guarantee the quality of books and 
magazines; and great efforts are also needed to resolve the 
question of what channels and methods should be used to enable 
state-owned book and magazine distributing enterprises to play 
their guiding role among wholesalers of books and magazines and 
to enable retailers of various economic compositions to display 
their skills. It is necessary, through deepening reform, to 
establish a new publication structure which is in keeping with 
the socialist market economy structure, which can meet the needs 
of the building of socialist spiritual civilization, and which 
reflects the laws of development of the publication industry 
itself; and it is necessary, through deepening reform, to 
establish a good operation mechanism and an effective management 
structure. In the course of the historical process of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, the press and 
publication sector should have greater and faster development 
and should make even greater contributions to the revitalization 
of the Chinese nation. 
  Under the conditions of the socialist market economy, the 
press and publication will, for a long time to come, face the 
question of how to properly handle the relationship between 
social benefits and economic results. That the press and 
publication organizations have attached importance to operation 
and management and to economic results is in fact a gratifying 
change brought about by reform and opening up in the past 10 
years and more. The reason is very simple. When the press and 
publication organizations have universally assumed sole 
responsibility for their own profits and losses, it will be 
difficult to ensure social benefits without attaching importance 
to economic results. However, the problem is that at present, 
"money worship" and "putting money before anything else" are 
having a serious erosive influence on press and publication 
workers and the phenomena of "paid news reports," "selling book 
title registrations," and so on have seriously affected the 
healthy development of the press and publication sector. 
Comrade Xiaoping once pointed out sharply: "The tendency of 
`putting money before anything else' and commercializing 
spiritual products has also appeared in other aspects of 
spiritual production. Some people who unworthily occupy places 
in literature and art circles, publication circles, and cultural 
circles have simply become merchants who are bent solely on 
profit." ("The Party's Pressing Tasks on the Organizational 
Front and the Ideological Front") Through summing up the 
experience and lessons of the press and publication work in past 
years, it is not difficult to see that many problems in the 
press and publication sector are of course caused by ideological 
understanding, but more of them are caused by the desire to reap 
great profits and by the "worship of money." Therefore, we must 
persist in putting social benefits in the most important 
position and, with this as the prerequisite, unify economic 
results with social benefits. At the same time, it is necessary 
to adopt measures related to structure and rules to eradicate 
the influence of "money worship" and to ensure the healthy 
development of the press and publication. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's expositions on persisting in 
"grasping with both hands" and grasping firmly with both hands 
are guidance for press and publication work. So long as we 
seriously grasp their essence and use them to guide practical 
work and so long as we adhere to the correct orientation, carry 
out management according to law, deepen reform, and promote 
prosperity, the press and publication sector will certainly 
develop further.

Civic and Political Rights Were Restored Yesterday"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 16 Feb -- The Chinese Public Security 
Ministry informed Wang Dan this afternoon that his civic and 
political rights have been officially restored. A public 
security officer nevertheless warned him that further 
investigation would be conducted regarding the pieces he wrote 
for overseas media during this period. Wang said, however, that 
safeguarding the freedom of speech is a component of China's 
democratic movement and that he would continue writing. 
  Deprivation of political rights primarily refers to the 
right 
to vote and stand for election, the freedoms of speech, press, 
and assembly as laid down in the constitution, and the right to 
take up posts in an enterprise or institution, among other 
rights.

<F P=106> [By P.N. Kandinsky] </F>
  [Text] The Beijing intellectual was openly sarcastic. 
"Was this meant to be a festive gift for us?" he asked. 
  He was referring to the reshuffle at the Chinese Academy of 
Social Sciences (Cass), announced on the eve of the lunar new 
year. 
  Wang Renzhi, the hardliner who formerly headed the Communist 
Party's Central Propaganda Department and carried out the purge 
of government critics in 1989, was made senior vice-chairman of 
the once prestigious think tank. 
  Wang joined Cass in 1992 as the party boss, but did not have 
any defined position in the administration. 
  The official announcement directed at overseas audiences 
said 
that new heads had been named at 43 of the 150 institutes under 
Cass and that liberal academics involved in the 1989 protests or 
close to the former party chief, Zhao Ziyang, had been removed. 
  Loyalty to socialism and "revolutionary spirit" were 
considered in addition to professional qualifications in making 
the appointments. 
  But the official report did not mention Wang's appointment, 
perhaps because even his comrades knew this might have spoiled a 
public relations exercise boasting a younger, more capable Cass 
leadership "emancipated in thought and perspective". 
  "What a joke," sneered an older intellectual who translates 
social science books. 
  "I'm surprised there is still something that can make them 
feel embarrassed, now that they have turned our profession into 
the most politically repressed and economically pointless way to 
make a living in the entire country." 
  Staff were not consulted about Wang's nomination. Some had 
signed a protest letter to the top leadership when he was 
transferred to Cass. 
  Despite the economic reform of the past couple of years, 
social science research in China has remained under tight 
control by a small group of ideologically conservative officials 
who rose to power with the crackdown on the 1989 mass protests. 
  Freedom in academic pursuits and expression are still 
regarded as dangerous by the regime. 
  News of Wang's appointment came shortly after a national 
conference on propaganda. The only message of the conference 
was that the party wanted to reassert "leadership on public 
opinion". 
  One new twist, however, was a warning to the press not to 
indulge in publicising "certain issues" to such a degree that 
they have "excessive social impact". 
  The "certain issues" concerned, according to Beijing 
journalists, include last year's high rate of inflation -- the 
third-highest record during the reform era -- and rampant 
corruption. 
  Inflation and corruption were the two most important factors 
which drove millions of citizens to join in open protests in 
many Chinese cities in 1989, which the regime was able to 
disperse only by using armed force. 
  The situation in the Year of the Dog is in many ways as 
serious as at the beginning of 1989, according to some social 
scientists. 
  The leadership has an abiding fear of serious social 
research, noted one Beijing university teacher, who said it was 
a "lesson learned four years ago", when many Cass researchers 
were participants and even leaders in the mass protests. 
  To control social science, the regime not only uses fusty 
bureaucrats such as Wang Renzhi -- who himself has accepted 
bribes, according to former subordinates at the Party Propaganda 
Department -- but it has also financially crippled research in 
many Cass institutes. 
  Since the 1989 crackdown, the Institute of Political Science 
and the Institute of Marxism, Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought -- 
two departments which produced some of the regime's most 
articulate critics -- have not embarked on a single important 
project. 
  Administrative control of these two institutes has been 
merged with the Institute of Law Studies, Cass sources said. 
  "It is a tradition in Soviet style systems that political 
science can never be treated as a separate discipline, but 
rather must be subordinated to Stalin's theory on the state and 
law," the source said. 
  The library at Cass can only afford to renew subscriptions 
to 
a quarter of the foreign social science periodicals it used to 
import during the 1980s -- dropping from nearly 4,000 titles to 
only 800 -- due to the devaluation of renminbi and lack of any 
corresponding increase in funding. 
  Since mid-1993, some Cass institutes have leased their 
office 
rooms to businesses or converted them into cheap hotels. 
  In the worst cases, money earmarked for research was 
distributed as year-end bonuses among staff who would otherwise 
have to cancel their holiday shopping. 
  Ironically, nearly every institute has set up a "leading 
group on money-making activities" (chuangshou lingdao xiaozu), 
often headed by the institute director. 
  The money-making group is expected to eke out the 
institute's 
lean research budget and supplement the staff's meagre welfare 
funds. 
  But the Institute of Political Science has not even been 
able 
to get its money-making venture off the ground. 
  The main reason, according to one source at Cass, is that 
its 
field of learning has no commercial value. 
  Moreover, the institute director, Wu Daying, who was also 
installed after the 1989 crackdown, is said to be extremely 
selfish as well as incompetent. He does not want to share any 
of his own money-making opportunities with colleagues with 
differing political views. 
  A typical middle-aged researcher at Cass earns just less 
than 
300 renminbi (HK$265 [Hong Kong dollars]) a month. To buy a 
decent suit in Beijing costs more than 1,000 renminbi. 
  Finding a publisher for one's scholarly work in the market 
place can be an uphill battle, even if the book is not 
politically sensitive. 
  A manuscript will not usually be accepted by mainland 
publishers unless the author promises to sell -- or buy -- most, 
if not all, of the books. 
  "The whole process takes two years to complete," said a Cass 
literary critic, "and you get nothing out of it at the end 
except being worn to a frazzle." 
  A "sense of loss" has also invaded the six Cass institutes 
of 
economic research. Some receive research contracts, thereby 
offsetting funding problems, but still face a brain drain crisis 
because economists are being offered lucrative corporate 
positions in the external job market.

<F P=106> [By correspondents Liu Linzong (0491 2651 1350) and Huang </F>
Weihua (7806 1218 5478)] 
  [Text] Beijing, Feb 16 (XINHUA) -- Upon returning here 
from Xichang Satellite Launch Center recently, Long Lehao (7893 
2867 6275), vice president of the Chinese Academy of Carrier 
Rocket Technology and general architect of the Long-March 3A 
carrier rocket, said: The rocket's successful launch marked a 
giant step forward and a new stage in the development of China's 
rocket technology. It is a rare event in China's rocket 
development history to achieve complete success during a 
rocket's first test launch. 
  Long Lehao said: The Long-March 3A rocket, which 
incorporates China's latest carrier rocket technology, is 
actually a brand new model. The newly developed high-energy 
oxyhydrogen III (gao neng qing yang di san ji 7559 5174 8641 
8638 0005 4787] involved the successful tackling of several 
hundred technological problems and the development of dozens of 
major new technologies, many of which approach contemporary 
advanced international levels. The carrier rocket also employs 
a control system for operating four-spindle gyroscope 
oscillating platform [dong diao tuo luo si zhou rao xing ping 
tai 0520 6148 7094 5828 0934 6519 2371 1840 1627 0669] for the 
first time in China, a technology quite advanced even in the 
world. The use of the cold helium heating pressurization 
technology [leng hai jia wen zeng ya ji shu 0397 8640 0502 3306 
1073 1090 2111 2611] for pressurizing the third-stage liquid 
oxygen chamber makes China the second country after the United 
States to independently and successfully develop and utilize 
such a technology. The low-temperature hydrogen energy source 
[di wen qing qi neng yuan] and other technologies used in the 
servo-control mechanism of the third-level oscillating power 
generator [san ji bai dong fa dong ji 0005 4787 2369 0520 4099 
0520 2623] is also a new technology in our country. 
  Long Lehao said: The successful launch has extremely great 
significance to China's space undertakings: 
  -- The successful launch has provided a carrier vehicle for 
China's new-generation and bigger-capacity satellites -- the 
Dongfanghong [East Is Red] 3. As a result, it will play an 
important role in promoting the development of China's broadcast 
and telecommunications industries. China's new-model 
telecommunications satellites will serve the needs of its 
economic construction even better if they can be launched 
earlier. 
  -- It helps lay the foundation for the formation of a rocket 
series capable of carrying the largest payload onto higher 
orbits. The carrying capacity of the Long-March 3A is 2.5 
tonnes, up from the Long-March 3's 1.4 tonnes. The Long-March 
3B -- which is based on the Long-March 3A with extended 
second-stage rocket, an enhanced cowling system, and four 
cluster liquid booster rockets -- is capable of carrying 4.8 
tonnes of payload. The Long-March 3C, which strips two booster 
rockets from the Long-March 3B, is capable of carrying 3.5 
tonnes of payload. The Long-March 3A, 3B, and 3C rockets 
constitute China's rocket series capable of carrying the largest 
payloads onto higher orbits. The series is capable of carrying 
a wide range of payloads. It ranks first in China and second in 
the world in terms of the capacity to carry payload onto higher 
or lower orbits. 
  -- The success in the rocket's first test launch greatly 
improves the Long March rocket's competitiveness in the 
international market for satellites launch services. Because it 
is capable of carrying a payload ranging from 1.4 tonnes to 4.8 
tonnes and sending it to geosynchronous orbit and because it is 
capable of launching one, two, or three satellites at the same 
time, it can be used for launching a variety of satellites and 
thereby has a greater appeal to consumers. The Long-March 3A 
can also change orbits, redirect, initiate revolution [qi xuan 
6386 2467], and conduct large attitude angular movement 
according to consumers' demands.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Efficiency Helps Cut Pollution"] </F>
  [Text] To prevent environmental degradation while still 
striving for economic growth, China should raise industrial 
efficiency and reform industrial structures, said Qu Geping, the 
country's top environmental legislator. 
  Heavy financial input and raw material consumption have 
helped maintain China's high economic growth as well as giving 
rise to heavy pollution, said Qu, head of the Environment 
Committee of the National People's Congress, in Environment 
Protection [HUANJING BAOHU] magazine. 
  Despite significant progress, China's industrial efficiency 
in recent years still lags behind that of developed countries. 
  To produce the same amount of industrial products, China 
uses 
five to 10 times more water than developed nations, Qu said. 
  Authorities have not fully recognized the importance of 
environmental protection in drafting economic plans. 
  Priority has been given to increasing the input of raw 
materials and energy, while encouraging low energy consumption 
and low pollution has been largely ignored. 
  China can no longer afford this model, Qu said. 
  First, resource reserves are limited. China's per capita 
water availability is only a quarter of the world average; per 
capita land area is only one-third of the global level; and per 
capita mineral resources only account for half the world average. 
  With population growth and economic development, the 
shortage 
of resources will only become more acute. 
  If measures are not taken to raise efficiency, production 
costs will rise and industrial development will be handicapped, 
Qu said. 
  The environment has become an important concern in the 
world. 
Pollution control and environmental protection regulations have 
been included in many international trade laws, with possible 
sanctions against nations with poor environmental performances. 
  And China, increasingly dependent upon foreign trade, must 
abide by international laws. 
  Qu suggested that China speed up its industrial, structural 
reshuffle and technological renovation to reduce pollution. 
  One method would be to increase the number of non-polluting 
industries, such as the service sector. 
  Another method would be to reduce the consumption of energy 
and raw materials. Pollutants should be recycled, treated or 
stored to create a more efficient consumption. 
  Qu also called for increased government funding to fight 
pollution because environmental protection has become very 
costly. 
  The government should try to allocate 1 to 1.5 percent of 
its 
GNP to protecting the environment. Presently the figure is only 
0.7 percent. 
  And environmental investment is very profitable. For every 
100 yuan of investment, 600 yuan of profit could be generated. 
  The State might not be able to afford the increased 
expenditures, Qu said, but spending cuts should come from other 
portions of the budget to finance environmental protection. 
  More money earmarked for industrial projects should be given 
to environmental protection. The government should demand that 
8 to 10 per cent of new industrial investment go to 
environmental protection, instead of the present 4.5 percent. 
  The government can also raise standards for pollutant 
discharge, Qu said, adding that low standards partly explain why 
many businesses are not eager to fight pollution. 
  The government needs to adjust financial policies to make it 
easier for the environmental protection projects to get bank 
loans.

<F P=106> ["CD News" report: "Rural Firms to Blame for Nation's </F>
Polluation"] 
  [Text] Township industries are seriously polluting the air 
and water in Tianjin, Shanghai and Beijing, according to the 
National Environmental Protection Agency. 
  Rural enterprises are also pumping out massive amounts of 
industrial waste water and sulphur dioxide fumes in the 
provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Sichuan 
and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. 
  The agency's nationwide survey of the environmental hazards 
caused by township enterprises is the first of its kind. 
  The aim is to help central and local governments improve 
pollution control by identifying the worst offenders. 
  The discharge of industrial waste water around the three 
major cities and in the worst hit provinces accounted for almost 
60 percent of the China's total township water pollution, 
according to the agency. 
  Places facing grave air pollution problems are listed as 
Shanghai Jiangsu, Henan, Shandong, Beijing, Shanxi, Tianjin, 
Zhejiang and Sichuan. 
  The rural industries in these areas produced 57.2 percent of 
the pollutants piped into the air by rural firms around the 
country. 
  These areas were also to blame for 60 per cent of 
township-produced sulphur dioxide, 63 percent of the smoke and 
55.8 percent of the industrial dust of the country's total, 
according to the agency's investigation. The survey, which was 
started in 1989, covered 570,000 enterprises in almost every 
county in the country. Only the Tibetan Autonomous Region and 
Taiwan were left out. 
  Fourteen types of factories were named as major polluters. 
  They included industries involved in asbestos, coke, cement, 
chemicals, paper-making, leather processing, dyeing and brewing. 
  Many of the small industries had out-of-date production 
technology and a high rate of waste discharge. 
  To date less than one-fifth of rural industry reaches State 
standards for waste water disposal. 
  The investigation also revealed that for every five rural 
firms there was only one environmental protection officer. 
  This clearly showed that factory managers in these areas 
still cared little about their environment says the survey. 
  Industrial waste and gas were found to be the major causes 
of 
rural pollution. 
  The Farmers' Daily [NONGMIN RIBAO] has said that 
pollution-control technologies must be introduced into rural 
enterprises and the construction of dirty factories and mills 
must be limited. The best way of controlling pollution is to 
adopt advanced waste disposal technology, according to the 
newspaper.

<F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Despite Festival, Savings Soar"] </F>
  [Text] Bank deposits have risen dramatically across the 
country since the beginning of this year, despite the 
traditional shopping spree during the New Year and Spring 
Festival holidays, according to official sources. 
  By the end of January, personal savings in domestic banks 
hit 
a total of 1,480 billion yuan ($172.1 billion), an increase of 
some 3.7 billion yuan ($426 million) over December. 
  Of the total, fixed time deposits accounted for some 70 per 
cent, which enhanced the lending strength of the country's banks 
for the national economy. 
  Analysts say the savings increase indicates that the 
country's high interest-rate policy still poses significant 
attraction for people to keep their savings in the banks, thus 
easing inflationary pressure on the domestic market. 
  "In an effort to encourage deposits, the bank saving 
interest 
rate is at its highest since China launched economic reform in 
1978," said Zhou Rongfang, an official with the Interest Rate 
Department of the People's Bank of China, the central bank. 
  In January, the Industrial and Commercial Bank, a leading 
savings bank, saw individual savings in its Beijing, Tianjin and 
Shanghai branches increase almost 2.2 billion yuan ($255 
million) from the previous month. 
  Li Lan, a bank official, said that the corporate bonds and 
shares in the securities exchanges have not yet become 
attractive enough to draw money away from bank savings. 
  Ordinary Chinese still believe the best way to protect their 
savings from devaluation is to rely on the bank saving interest 
rates, which now stand at an annual rate of 10.98 per cent for 
one-year fixed deposits," he explained. 
  Many Beijing depositors say that they knew little about the 
shares listed in the stock exchange, and were unwilling to take 
the risk of investing their lifetime savings in them. 
  "We are counting on our bank savings to support our 
children's education and the opportunity of buying an 
apartment--the biggest item on the spending list of most Chinese 
consumers," said Xiao Wang, who, along with his wife, work for a 
foreign-funded firm in Beijing. 
  Zhang Qingshou, Vice-President of the Industrial and 
Commercial Bank, said his bank will carefully use its saving 
deposits, which are the source for more than half of its bank 
loans, to ensure a sound implementation of its lending plan this 
year. 
  This year, more than 60 per cent of the bank's loans are 
expected to support the country's industrial enterprises, and 
the rest will be earmarked for commercial loans, Zhang said. 
  Prompted by the strong backing of bank loans and the buoyant 
domestic market, the country's industrial enterprises also saw 
their output grow 33.2 per cent in January over the same period 
last year. 
  A constant rate of production, said an official with the 
State Statistics Bureau, was, to some extent, driven by 
improvement in product sales. 
  The bureau's figures show China's retail sales reached 119.2 
billion yuan ($13.8 billion) last month, an increase of 22 per 
cent from the same month last year.

China Financial Research Institute, edited by Wang Yi (3769 
3085): "Monetary Policy Under the Socialist Market Economy"] 
  [Text] The 14th CPC National Congress unequivocally stated 
that: "the aim of the reform of our economic structure is to 
establish a socialist market economic structure." The question 
which needs to be studied now is what monetary policy should be 
adopted under such an economic structure in order to further 
develop the productive forces. 
<H3>  I. The Socialist Market Economy Still Needs a Stable 
Monetary Policy </H3>
  Under the socialist market economic structure, we must 
continue to implement a stable monetary policy because, only in 
this way, will the national economy be able to maintain the 
following desirable elements: 
  1. The coordinated, sustained, and rapid development of 
production. 
  Under the socialist market economy, the operation of the 
economy and the deployment of resources as a whole will 
basically be regulated by market forces instead of mainly 
through planning as was the case in the past. Regulation by 
market forces must be realized through the money medium. Thus, 
only by maintaining a stable money market will production be 
able to develop in a coordinated, sustained, and rapid manner. 
On the other hand, according to our experience in the 40 years 
and more since the founding of the People's Republic, and 
especially in the more than 10 years since reform and opening 
up, inflation upsets the existing economic structure, disrupts 
the production order, and results in abnormal economic 
development. Let us take the situation after the beginning of 
reform and opening up as an example. An important cause of 
inflation during this period was the fact that investment in 
capital construction increased by too great an amount too 
swiftly. Blind investments produced and intensified the 
economic imbalance. When this state of affairs became so 
serious that capital construction funds were not forthcoming and 
there was a serious shortage of capital goods, readjustment 
became necessary. For example, in order to halt inflation in 
1988, a policy of rectification and readjustment was introduced 
in the fourth quarter. The result of this was that by early 
1990, industrial production was sluggish and the market was 
slow. There was serious stockpiling of finished products and 
arrears in payments. The economic performance of enterprises 
had declined and economic development had suffered. 
  Is it possible, in times of inflation, for the original 
production pattern to be affected not or for production order to 
not be disrupted? No, it is not possible. 
  Fundamentally, the effect of inflation is to change the 
patterns of production and resource distribution. If it does 
not change the pattern of production and resource distribution, 
inflation becomes a phenomenon of no real significance. With 
all other conditions remaining the same, if money supply is 
doubled and divided equally among the various economic sectors, 
units, and individuals in accordance with the original pattern 
of distribution, then the money supply increase will neither 
bring any benefit nor harm. Although prices will double, the 
fact that the money in people's hands has also doubled means 
everything will be the same. It will just be that the current 
two yuan note will be worth the same as a one yuan note in the 
past. This was what happened in 1954 when new one yuan notes 
were issued as replacements when the old 10,000 yuan notes were 
withdrawn. In reality, however, additional money supply cannot 
be divided so equally. Quite the contrary because, due to a 
combination of reasons both subjective and objective, some 
people end up having more money and others less after inflation; 
some enterprises are able to grab large quantities of 
commodities in short supply, while others have difficulty 
satisfying their normal needs. There is thus bound to be a 
blind redistribution of funds and materials in society. The 
original production pattern will be upset and economic 
development will suffer. This is true under a planned economic 
structure and also in the process of economic structural reform. 
Under the socialist market economic structure when 
microeconomic activities are no longer subject to the restraints 
of central planning and the guidance of administrative units at 
the higher levels, and are basically dependent on market forces, 
this is even more true. 
  2. Making full use of the material resources of society. 
  The fundamental factor determining the speed of our economic 
development is goods and materials. Since we already have an 
abundance of labor supply, we will be able to develop at a high 
speed provided that we have sufficient goods and materials. If 
we have a shortage of goods and materials, development will slow 
down. This basic condition will not change under the socialist 
market economy. During inflationary times, people will 
anticipate that prices will further escalate, and goods and 
materials will be in short supply, and thus they will strive to 
stock up more, especially those goods in great demand. 
Subsequently, some enterprises will have stocks that exceed 
their normal needs. The resultant stockpiling will render it 
impossible to bring into full play the limited material 
resources of society and this will further aggravate shortages 
and production and construction will be subject to even greater 
material resource restrictions. 
  When inflation occurs, people prefer goods to money. This 
mentality also has an impact on the consumer goods market. With 
people buying more consumer goods than they need, the limited 
supply of consumer goods cannot be reasonably distributed, with 
the result that the actual needs of the majority cannot be met. 
  3. Raising more funds for construction. 
  Under the socialist market economy, economic development 
will 
accelerate and more construction funds will be needed. Personal 
bank deposits and the purchase of various types of bonds will 
continue to be an important source of funds for economic 
development. In the primary distribution of national income, 
due to various constraints, it is not possible to retain too 
great an amount of the funds for construction. On this basis, 
in order to further increase construction funds and accelerate 
development, it is necessary to increase bank savings deposits 
and rationally issue bonds so as to turn more consumption funds 
into production funds. Absorbing people's savings deposits and 
selling them bonds is a means of financing which only requires 
people to temporarily assign the use rights of their money 
without changing the ownership and payment is offered for the 
concession. This method of raising funds for construction can 
truly increase the volume of construction funds, without 
changing the balance between total supply and total demand, 
since all that it requires is to use those material resources 
set aside for consumption on production instead. It can also 
increase people's incomes or provide them with safeguards 
against inflation so that they can relax and really devote their 
energy to work. However, people will only show a positive 
response to deposit-taking and bond issues if the currency is 
stable. If inflation occurs, prices go up, money depreciates, 
and interest rates fall below the degree of devaluation and 
people will not only fail to get any real interest by putting 
their money in savings deposit accounts or buying bonds but will 
also not be able to even maintain the value of their principal. 
In times like these, bank savings deposit balances and the 
amount of bonds purchased will not increase and may even drop as 
a result. This is precisely what has happened in the past. In 
1988 China was hit by inflation. In the first seven months of 
that year, the increase in the balance of urban and rural 
savings deposits was 4 billion yuan less than in the same period 
of the previous year. In August, the balance was 2.6 billion 
yuan less than the July figure, and the annual figure was tens 
of billions of yuan less. In the first half of 1993, 
inflationary pressure increased and national retail prices were 
up by 10.5 percent. Between January and the end of June, urban 
and rural savings only increased by 124.4 billion yuan, 9 
billion yuan less than in the same period the previous year. 
Sales of state bonds were slow. Although the state could 
increase its note-issue funds by issuing more bank notes, 
inflation would reduce bank savings deposits and funds obtained 
from bond issues. Thus, for the country as a whole, the issuing 
of more bank notes will not in fact increase the pool of funds, 
while the reduction in savings deposits and bond sales means 
that material resources that could have been used in economic 
construction will be spent on consumption and this implies a 
real cut in funds. Hence, inflation definitely leads to a 
reduction in funds for national construction. 
  It must be pointed out that when we spoke of savings and 
bonds in the previous paragraph, we did not touch on the 
question of the purchase of shares by individuals. This is 
because, unlike savings deposits, the purchase of shares is an 
act of direct investment. The value of shares changes with the 
financial and profit-making capabilities of the shareholding 
companies and automatically serves as a guarantee for value in 
times of inflation. However, as inflation escalates, 
shareholding companies will not be able to conduct normal 
production and operations. Profits from production and 
operations will drop and dividends will fall as a result. This 
will also dampen people's enthusiasm for share purchases. 
  4. Giving full scope to the enthusiasm of the broad numbers 
of workers for labor. 
  Under the socialist market economy, it is necessary to keep 
workers' wages at a reasonable level when turning production 
factors into commodities. This is also dependent on the 
stability of currency value and prices. When currency value and 
prices are stable, the broad numbers of workers will not have to 
worry about the devaluation of their income and it will be 
possible to fully arouse their enthusiasm for labor. If 
inflation and price rises occur, workers will find their real 
income diverging from their nominal income and some will even 
find their real income slashed. Even if the state continues to 
provide price subsidies, it will be impossible to make up for 
the losses incurred by individual staff and workers because 
losses due to devaluation are shared by people's monetary 
income, savings deposits, and cash in hand and cannot be 
entirely offset by increased subsidies. Ours is a socialist 
country where the masses of the people are masters of the 
country. Workers and other people will understand and accept 
the need to rationally control the growth of consumption funds 
in order to more rapidly develop the economy. However, they 
will have objections if inflation occurs and part of the value 
already in their hands is taken away. In a socialist market 
economy, people's income will generally increase and the extent 
of income growth will exceed that of price rises. Does this 
mean they are willing to accept inflation? Under the 
circumstances, they will naturally be less resentful of 
inflation, but it will be impossible for them to have no 
objections at all. Since the beginning of reform and opening 
up, people's income has generally gone up swiftly and the 
increase far exceeds the average extent of devaluation. During 
the inflation of 1988, some people complained about various 
things although their living standards were in fact much better 
than before. If inflation has too great an impact on workers' 
income, so much so that many workers are finding their real 
income slashed, social stability and unity will also be 
adversely affected. 
<H3>  II. The Socialist Market Economy Has the Objective 
Possibility of a Stable Currency </H3>
  The reason for this is that most of the factors of inflation 
can be eliminated after the establishment of the socialist 
market economic structure. 
  As we all know, inflation has occurred a number of times 
since China's reform and opening. We had inflation in 1985 and 
1988. Inflationary pressure was also strong in 1993. In most 
cases, inflation was the direct result of over-extended 
investment in fixed assets, excessive growth of consumption 
funds and huge financial deficits. On a deeper level, it was 
because, in the current process of reform, the original 
mechanisms which restrained inflation had been weakened but new 
mechanisms of restraint suited to the socialist market economic 
structure had not been established. Also, the macrocontrol 
mechanism was in a situation where the old had been dismantled 
while a new one had not yet been put in place. After entry into 
the socialist market economy, internal mechanisms of restraint 
against inflation will be developed and there will be objective 
conditions for a stable currency. 
  1. Investment entities will have a self-restraint mechanism 
in respect of their investment in fixed assets. 
  Prior to reform and opening up, all investments in fixed 
assets were controlled by the state through mandatory plans and 
funds were basically allocated by the state's financial 
administration. Although this system was not conducive to 
arousing the enthusiasm of different localities, departments, 
and enterprises and needed to be reformed, it was a very 
effective system of control. As long as suitable arrangements 
were made by the state in respect of investment in fixed assets, 
the scale of investment would never become over-extended. 
  Since the beginning of reform and opening up, investment 
entities have become more diversified and the scope covered by 
state investment plans has been narrowed. Although this has had 
the effect of arousing the enthusiasm of all quarters for 
economic development and invigorating the economy, it has also 
weakened the state's control of the overall scale of investment 
in fixed assets. Since the Chinese economy is still rather 
backward, everyone hopes to speed up economic development and 
put this backwardness behind us as quickly as possible. This, 
coupled with the lack of clearly-defined responsibility for 
decisions made in respect of investment in fixed assets, caused 
leaders of some localities and departments and the directors and 
managers of some enterprises to overlook the importance of 
feasibility studies and to go after quick results. They blindly 
increased investment in fixed assets and launched new projects, 
such as embarking on 10 billion yuan projects when they only had 
8 billion yuan. As a result, the overall scale of investment in 
fixed assets has always been over-extended in recent years, 
especially in years of inflation. Even if we do do not concern 
ourselves with questions such as whether or not there are any 
circulating funds and whether or not production can be well 
coordinated after the completion of the projects, when all funds 
are invested in fixed assets, the bank will have to issue more 
bank notes and this will lead to inflation. Assuming that the 
ratio of circulating funds to fixed capital is 3:7 for most 
enterprises, and assuming that a locality has 100 billion yuan 
available for economic development in a particular year, 
theoretically speaking, they should set aside 70 billion yuan 
for investment in fixed assets and 30 billion yuan for 
circulating funds. If all of the 100 billion yuan is invested 
in fixed assets and circulating funds amounting to 43 billion 
yuan are needed for various support programs after the 
completion of the project, it will mean that they have made 
plans for 143 billion yuan when they only had 100 billion yuan. 
This is an important reason why we have had an imbalance in 
construction funds and have been hit by inflation time and again 
in recent years. 
  Following the establishment of a socialist market economy, 
the overwhelming majority of state-owned enterprises will become 
limited shareholding companies or limited liability companies 
and property relations will be straightened out. Collective 
enterprises, private enterprises, and Sino-foreign joint 
ventures will have a considerable weighting in the national 
economy. Investment in fixed assets in society will mainly be 
undertaken by different types of enterprises and returns on 
investment will be closely tied to the personal interests of the 
enterprise decisionmakers. The enterprise decisionmakers will 
exercise great prudence in matters of investment. They will 
carefully consider and study the feasibility of investment, the 
product sales after the completion of the projects, as well as 
the size of returns and generally will not act blindly. In this 
way, the problem of the over-extension of investment in fixed 
assets can basically be avoided. 
  2. Enterprises will also exercise self restraint in respect 
of their consumption funds. 
  Prior to reform and opening up, China had a unified wage 
system, where wage grades and levels were centrally fixed by the 
state. Without arrangements and planning by the state, no 
locality or unit had the power to change the wage levels of its 
workers. At that time, bonuses and other expenditures in 
respect of workers were scant and were fixed by the state. 
Provided that appropriate arrangements were made by the state, 
consumption funds would not inflate. 
  Since the beginning of reform and opening up, the original 
mechanism of restraint on consumption funds has basically lost 
its effect. Since a new mechanism of restraint has not yet been 
fully developed, control over consumption funds has been 
weakened. This makes it possible for desires cherished by 
workers for higher wage and bonus levels to assert themselves. 
  At present, state-owned enterprises play a dominant role in 
the economy. The operational mechanism of the majority of these 
enterprises has yet to see a significant change. Directors and 
managers not only have the same fundamental interests as their 
staff and workers but also enjoy basically the same direct 
economic benefits. This was the ideological foundation which 
enabled directors and managers to unify all staff and workers 
and work with one heart and one mind in making their respective 
enterprises a success. This was the strong point enjoyed by 
state-owned enterprises. However, the fact that directors and 
managers enjoy the same economic benefits as their staff and 
workers also deprived enterprises of the ability to control 
their own consumption funds. Staff and workers hoped to have 
higher wages and more bonuses. Out of personal interest, 
directors and managers also wanted the same. 
  Moreover, there has been an increase in the number of 
shareholding enterprises, private enterprises and 
foreign-invested enterprises since reform and opening up and the 
wage levels in these enterprises are much higher than those in 
state-owned enterprises. In the wake of the invigoration of the 
economy, some people made a fortune after quitting their jobs 
for business. This set an example for others and strengthened 
the desires of state-owned enterprises and institutions, state 
organs, organizations, and military units to raise the wage 
levels of their employees. This in turn encouraged these units 
to raise the wage levels, bonuses, and other fringe benefits for 
their staff and workers without authorization, thereby causing 
the consumption funds to inflate. 
  Following the establishment of the socialist market economic 
structure, not only will the interests of the decisionmakers in 
collective enterprises, private enterprises, and Sino-foreign 
joint ventures be tied to the profits or losses of their 
respective enterprises but the income of the decisionmakers in 
limited shareholding companies, limited liability companies, and 
state-owned enterprises will also be tied to the performance of 
their respective enterprises. This will separate the interests 
of the enterprise decisionmakers from those of the staff and 
workers. If an enterprise has a high wage level, its costs will 
increase and its profits decrease, meaning that its 
decisionmakers will earn less. Conversely, if the wage level is 
reduced, costs will decrease and profits will increase, meaning 
that its decisionmakers will earn more. If the income of the 
decisionmakers is too high and the wage level of workers is too 
low, the latter will find this intolerable. Similarly, the 
decisionmakers will also find an unduly high wage level for 
workers unacceptable. This will guard against a situation where 
consumption funds expand faster than economic growth. 
  3. The government function will undergo a change but the 
power of macrocontrol will still be in the hands of the central 
government. 
  Prior to reform and opening up, economic operation was led 
and managed completely by the government. Since reform and 
opening up began, enterprises have been given increasingly 
greater autonomy. Although the function of the government in 
direct economic management has been weakened, local governments 
still bear considerable responsibility for the development of 
their local economies. Since local governments are elected by 
the local people, they all hope to provide more tangible 
benefits for their people. In particular, they hope to start 
more projects to bring about faster economic development. Of 
course, the local people will benefit from any new projects 
launched. However, since the renminbi is a national currency 
and the money market is unified, losses resulting from 
devaluation due to over-development in one place are borne by 
the whole nation. Thus, local governments often ignore the need 
to strike a balance between total supply and total demand, 
thinking that this is mainly the responsibility of the central 
government. Instead, they vie with one another to launch more 
projects and demand more construction funds. Even when total 
supply and total demand fail to balance, some still say that 
"other places have `overheated,' we have not even started 
`heating up.'" They still hope that none of their projects will 
be slashed and some even hope that they will be allowed to 
launch more projects. We can understand why they all want to 
speed up their own economic development. It provides the drive 
for national economic development and is a good thing. However, 
ignoring the need to strike a balance between total supply and 
total demand and putting too much emphasis on speeding up local 
economic development will adversely affect the sustained and 
stable development of the national economy. This is precisely 
what has happened. The successive rounds of inflation which 
have hit our country in recent years had a lot to do with the 
fact that local governments, oblivious to the need to strike a 
balance between total supply and total demand on a national 
level, blindly pooled funds, tried by all and every means to 
secure bank loans, and vied to speed up their local economies, 
with the result that money supply grew too fast. 
  After the establishment of the socialist market economy, the 
government's economic function will mainly be to exercise 
macroeconomic control, create a fine environment for economic 
development, and properly manage state-owned assets. Meanwhile, 
the government will rely mainly on economic and legal means, 
supplemented by the necessary administrative means, to influence 
and manage the microeconomy. The functions and powers of the 
central and local governments in the management of the economy 
will be clearly divided. The power of macroeconomic control 
will be in the hands of the central authorities. The local 
governments will only be able to give positive support to, and 
will not be able to interfere with, the central government's 
macrocontrol measures. 
  4. An effective macroeconomic control mechanism will be 
established. 
  In order to ensure the smooth development of the national 
economy, it is necessary to establish a macroeconomic control 
mechanism that can ensure effective control of the macroeconomy 
while invigorating the microeconomy. This means that we must 
rely mainly on economic measures in effecting regulation and 
control. However, in the process of economic structural reform, 
because of the low percentage of business-oriented enterprises 
in the overall economy, the use of economic measures to effect 
regulation and control is still not able to achieve the desired 
results. For example, the central bank tried to keep a lid on 
loans by raising interest rates but this failed to get major 
state-owned banks and enterprises to reduce their demands for 
credit funds. The reason is that these state-owned banks and 
enterprises did not attach the necessary importance to cost and 
profits and would pay any amount of interest to get more funds. 
By raising the deposit reserve rate, the central bank had 
weakened the ability of major state-owned banks to generate more 
deposits and expand loans. However, if they faced a shortage of 
credit funds as a result and could not accomplish the prescribed 
lending tasks, particularly policy-lending tasks, the central 
bank would have to increase its loans to them to make up for 
their shortage of funds. Thus, for the time being we can only 
rely on administrative measures, that is, management by quota, 
to control total credit and money supply. However, since 
economic activities as a whole have been invigorated and the 
concept of planning has been weakened, administrative measures 
are no longer as effective as before. Many localities have 
successfully bypassed the quota restraints in obtaining more 
state credit funds. According to estimates by the departments 
concerned, between 1992 and the first half of 1993, apart from 
the more than 100 billion yuan obtained through inter-bank 
borrowing and bank credit as mentioned above, an additional 100 
billion yuan and more had been pooled through blind fundraising. 
Although funds thus raised were directly borrowed by 
enterprises or local governments from the masses, most of the 
money still came from bank deposits or deposit sources (that is, 
money which people intended to deposit into their bank 
accounts). The issuing of shares and bonds by enterprises is an 
important measure for transforming the operational mechanism of 
enterprises and, as such, should be supported and promoted. 
However, if overall arrangements are not properly carried out 
and banks are not suitably relieved of some of their lending 
tasks after enterprises have sucked up credit funds through 
issuing shares and bonds, bloated credit and inflation will 
occur. 
  After the establishment of the socialist market economy, the 
People's Bank of China, as the central bank, will free itself of 
various types of business activities and will take the 
strengthening of macroeconomic control and the safeguarding of 
the value of the renminbi as its most important tasks. 
Policy-lending banks have now been established. They will take 
over the general banking activities currently handled by the 
central bank, as well as the policy-related banking business 
which is currently handled by major state-owned banks and which 
must be placed under the direct management and control of the 
government. Various major state-owned banks have already been 
turned into commercial banks. Meanwhile, a number of national 
joint-stock banks have been established. In this way, there is 
keen competition between financial institutions in the urban and 
rural areas and in areas such as foreign exchange. The money 
market has been further liberalized and standardized and 
interest rates have also been liberalized in a controlled way. 
Moreover, a modern enterprise system has been established and 
the concepts of profit and interests have been strengthened in 
the whole society. An effective mechanism of macroeconomic 
control will soon take shape, after which it will be possible to 
keep currency value and prices basically stable. 
<H5>  III. Strengthen Control and Stabilize Currency Value </H5>
  In the first half of this year, retail prices on a national 
level were up by 10.5 percent, while savings deposits by urban 
and rural residents between January and late June increased by 
only 124.4 billion yuan, or 9 billion yuan less than in the same 
period of last year. Faced with a new round of inflation, we 
must conscientiously sum up historical experiences, unify our 
understanding, and firmly uphold the idea of a stable currency. 
  1. It is necessary to further eliminate the influence of the 
"theory that inflation is harmless." In the 1980's, some 
economists preached the "theory that inflation is harmless," 
which is otherwise referred to as the idea that "inflation is 
useful." Through the government's monetary policy, this theory 
became one of the causes of inflation. However, as many 
economists pointed out, the results precipitated by this theory, 
in turn, ruthlessly refuted the theory itself. 
  A. People who uphold the "theory that inflation is harmless" 
believe that inflation had the effect of "compulsory saving," 
thereby increasing state construction funds. This is 
superficial reasoning which shows a mechanical copying of 
Western economic theories without a thorough study of China's 
national conditions. 
  Inflation produces little "compulsory saving" in our country 
and, compared with the reduction in normal savings deposits, the 
loss far outweighs the gain. In our country, a large part of 
the nominal monetary funds obtained through issuing more bank 
notes will inevitably be used to cover the increased expenditure 
resulting from this. There are the following general types of 
money holders in China. The first type is state-owned 
enterprises. Other conditions being constant, the value of the 
money in their possession lost as a result of currency 
depreciation normally has to be made good through financial 
appropriation or additional bank loans. If this is not done, 
they will have to reduce the scale of their production and 
operations. The second type is government organs and 
organizations, armed forces units, and institutions that are 
dependent on financial appropriations. When depreciation of 
their currency holdings exceeds a given percentage, it is 
necessary for the financial administration to increase 
appropriation to them in order to maintain their normal 
operations. The third type is residents. In capitalist 
countries, the value of money depreciated may be regarded as 
additional taxation on individuals by the state and has the 
effect of "compulsory saving" but in China it does not have the 
same effect. Reluctant to see the people's living standards 
drop as a result, our party and government will, when price 
levels go up, suitably increase price subsidies to make up for 
losses sustained by staff and workers. The fourth type is 
limited liability companies, joint-stock companies, private 
enterprises, individual operations, and foreign-invested 
enterprises. In joint-stock companies with state capital, when 
inflation occurs, the value of that part corresponding to the 
state's share and manifested as state funds will see a reduction 
in value. But even so, the state will not on this basis issue 
more bank notes to cover this loss, thereby increasing the value 
of its holding and bringing about compulsory savings. The 
private holding will also see a reduction in the value of 
private capital. In times of inflation, the money held by 
private enterprises, individual economies, and foreign-invested 
enterprises will all see depreciation. However, viewed from the 
organization of enterprises and the economy as a whole, the 
situation is as follows: First, their funds mainly take the 
form of raw and semiprocessed materials, fuel, goods in process, 
and manufactured goods. They only have a small amount of cash. 
Moreover, the stock of money held by most enterprises is far 
smaller than their bank loans. In times of inflation, when the 
value of money depreciates, the value of bank loans drops. With 
the rise in commodity prices, most enterprises will find that 
the value of their property has increased rather than decreased 
in the final settlement of accounts. Second, enterprises may 
pass on losses from devaluation of currency by raising the price 
of their products. Third, when inflation occurs and the real 
wages of staff and workers declines, it is possible to lower 
costs and increase profits by not giving staff and workers 
appropriate subsidies. In short, if we do not take into 
consideration the disruption of the production order and the 
losses inflicted upon production and operation and only concern 
ourselves with the value inventory, enterprises will not have to 
expend their "compulsory savings" and may obtain more wealth 
from society. 
  B. Whether or not inflation is conducive to the utilization 
of "idle resources" is also worth studying. 
  The utilization of "idle resources" is primarily a question 
of how we should make use of idle resources. China is a 
developing country. In our country, the principal contradiction 
of the commodity market, particularly the capital goods market, 
is that demand exceeds supply. When inflation occurs, some 
enterprises are afraid that they will not be able to buy the 
materials they need in time. In order to sustain production and 
operation, they scramble to stock up on goods and materials at 
the risk of losses in the form of credit interest and storage 
fees, thereby making the distribution of goods in short supply 
even more irrational and making it all the more difficult to 
make full use of these materials. 
  Second, it is a question of utilizing idle labor. With the 
huge number of people unemployed in capitalist countries, there 
is a great waste of labor resources. If slow inflation can 
stimulate economic development, it can also increase the number 
of persons employed and utilize more of the idle labor. 
However, our country's labor employment rate is very high, the 
speed of economic development is very fast, and there is no need 
to further boost the employment rate through inflation. 
Further, as has been noted above, in our country inflation is 
not advantageous to the full utilization of goods and materials, 
it cannot accelerate the speed of economic development and, 
speaking in overall national terms, it cannot increase the 
number of persons employed. 
  The people who uphold the "theory that inflation is 
harmless" 
say that by using inflation and issuing a little more money, a 
number of construction projects will very quickly be able to 
raise funds and "go ahead." This is true. By using this method 
it will be possible to complete a few more projects. However, 
the price we will have to pay is really too great. Actually, 
while the issuing of money can be carried out in a centralized 
way, the devaluation of currency is generally manifested only 
gradually. If the original money circulation is normal and 
there is a basic balance between overall supply and demand, the 
value of the currency will be stable. If a further 10 billion 
yuan in currency is issued, it will be possible to carry out 
some more projects. When this 10 billion yuan is put into the 
market and the purchase of materials needed for construction 
commences, it will be possible to buy the materials and the 
price will not rise too much. This is because: First, the 
tightness of materials and the decline in the value of the 
currency will occur only gradually after the purchasing has 
begun. Only after the entire amount of money has been used up 
in purchases will the effects be fully manifested. The 
purchasing occurs first and the tightness in materials and the 
decline in value appear subsequently. When the tightness in 
goods and materials, the currency devaluation, and the rise in 
prices caused by this are fully manifested, the newly-commenced 
projects have already obtained all the goods and materials they 
need. Second, the losses resulting from the tightness in goods 
and materials, the devaluation of currency, and the increase in 
prices caused by this 10 billion yuan are jointly borne by all 
sides throughout the country. For example, if this 10 billion 
yuan eventually gives rise to a 1 percent rise in prices, then 
all the money in the hands of every unit and every person 
throughout the country will have lost 1 percent of its value. 
Even during the process by which it is being used for purchases, 
when prices have already begun to rise, it will still buy over 
9.9 billion yuan of goods and materials. From this we can 
clearly see that using the issuing of more money to fund new 
projects is actually a method of using the devaluing of money to 
take back some of the value represented by the funds already 
supplied to all sides. This results in some enterprises and 
construction units being unable to obtain the goods and 
materials they had planned on using. Thereby, some enterprises 
cannot complete their production plans and some construction 
projects cannot be completed on time. Very clearly, using the 
increased issuing of money to fund some more construction 
projects is done at the cost of some other enterprises being 
unable to complete their plans and the completion of some 
construction projects being delayed. Using the issuing of money 
to fund more new construction projects is, both from the overall 
and long-term viewpoints, truly not worthwhile. 
  Second, in terms of monetary policies, we should negate the 
theory of dual goals and establish the single goal of stable 
currency. In our country's economic circles, some persons have 
advocated implementing a dual-goal monetary policy. That is, 
they advocate a stable currency value and stable prices together 
with support for economic development as concurrent economic 
policy goals. They hold that while formulating and adopting 
monetary policies, it is necessary to consider both the 
stability of the currency and also ensure that the policies are 
beneficial to economic development. The people who uphold this 
view say that while ensuring the stability of prices does 
provide a necessary condition for economic growth, it is only 
when there is economic development that there is a dependable 
base for price stability. Of course, we cannot use inflation to 
spur economic growth but, likewise, we cannot seek currency 
stability just for the sake of currency stability. A stable 
currency and the development of the economy should complement 
each other. 
  If monetary policy could concurrently achieve these two 
goals, naturally, it would be ideal in the extreme. However, 
the experience of our country over many years indicates that the 
result of implementing dual goals is not beneficial to currency 
stability. Over the last 10 years and more, our country has seen 
repeated bouts of inflation. This was related to the dual-goal 
monetary policy we actually implemented. The governments of 
socialist countries are the organizers and managers of economic 
construction, the ones who require the funds for construction as 
well as the controllers of money-issuing powers. This is like a 
situation where when one hand needs money, the other hand 
produces it. It is thus very easy for excessive issuing of 
money to occur. In implementing a firm policy of currency 
stability, it may sometimes happen that there is excessive money 
supply. If we implement a dual-goal monetary policy, it will be 
easier for there to be excessive supply of money on the pretext 
of supporting economic development, thereby leading to inflation. 
  On the basis of experience over many years, we must firmly 
negate the "theory that inflation is harmless" and the "theory 
of dual goals," and take stable currency as the only goal of the 
central bank's monetary policy. Only if the currency is stable 
will it be possible for the economy to see sustained and smooth 
development. A stable currency is a precondition for economic 
development. If the central bank can maintain a stable currency 
market for society, it will make the greatest contribution to 
economic development. As compared with increasing the supply of 
money to support more construction projects, the importance of 
maintaining a stable currency market is far greater. This is 
very obvious. The benefits of building projects in excess of 
objective conditions are immediate and limited while the harm 
this brings is overall and deep. 
  The reason we do not agree with the dual-goal theory, 
instead stressing a stable currency as the sole goal of monetary 
policies, and urge the implementation of stable money policies 
is that a stable currency and stable prices as a goal is on a 
different level to economic development. A stable currency 
value and stable prices is a direct goal of monetary policies 
while developing the economy is also one of the major goals of a 
stable currency and stable prices. In other words, developing 
the economy is a goal of the monetary policy but an indirect and 
higher-level goal. Upholding a stable currency as the sole goal 
of monetary policy does not mean ignoring economic development 
but is aimed at putting in order the relationship between a 
stable currency and economic development to support faster and 
better economic development. 
  If we make economic development one of the direct goals of 
monetary policy, the point of departure will be stressing 
economic development but actually this will reduce the important 
position of economic development. Developing the economy is the 
overall goal of various types of economic policies. Of course, 
this naturally includes monetary policies but it should not be 
the direct goal of monetary policies. At the same time, this 
causes a dispersal of the attention of monetary policies and 
concentration cannot be centralized on maintaining a stable 
currency. This is not beneficial to the stability of the 
currency or of prices and eventually will be disadvantageous to 
the development of the economy. 
  Believing that monetary policies should have dual goals is, 
to a certain degree, putting economic development in opposition 
to currency stability and suggests that stable currency is not 
beneficial to economic development. However, we have noted 
above that only with a stable currency can the economy see 
smooth development. 
  In brief, only by taking a stable currency as the sole goal 
of monetary policies can we implement firm and stable money 
policies. In a situation where paper money is circulating, only 
by implementing such a monetary policy will it be possible to 
truly stabilize money and develop the economy more swiftly. 
  Third, strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control to 
strive for the stability of currency and prices. In order to 
truly stabilize currency value and prices at present, it is 
necessary to fully understand the money market in a timely way 
and use various sorts of relevant economic measures flexibly to 
do well in macroeconomic regulation and control. The state 
should clearly set down that the central bank must take as its 
major tasks doing well macroeconomic regulation and control, and 
guaranteeing the stability of currency value and of prices, and 
require that it puts all of its efforts into this. At present, 
the focus of macroeconomic regulation and control must continue 
to be placed on controlling the money supply and, through this 
on, achieving a balance between total supply and total demand 
and the stability of currency and prices. 
  What is referred to as the total volume of money supply is 
the amount of cash and transfer funds put into the market. This 
is formed through the utilization of funds by banks. Of the 
funds used by banks, 95 percent are credit funds and, thus, 
basically these are formed by bank credit. The funds activities 
by other sectors of the national economy can only affect the 
speed of turnover in the distribution of money in society. That 
is, they can transfer money from their sector to other sectors 
and they can accelerate or slow down the the speed of turnover 
of money but they cannot directly increase or reduce the supply 
of money. The financial administration's receipts and 
expenditure are also like this. In a situation where receipts 
and expenditure are balanced, the finances are obtained from 
society and used in society. They only increase the number of 
times money in society is turned over and carry out the 
redistribution of the volume of money in society. When surplus 
or deficits occur, although the amount of social money which the 
financial administration draws in from society may increase or 
decline, this is realized through increasing or decreasing the 
savings account which the financial administration has in the 
banks or through borrowing or overdrawing from the bank. In the 
end, it is still changes in bank credit influencing the total 
volume of money supply in society. Of course, this is not to 
say that the influence of the economic activities of nonbanking 
sectors on total social demand is negligible. On the contrary, 
the economic activities of these sectors are the basis which 
determines whether or not the flow of money is normal and 
whether or not the value of the currency is stable. That is to 
say, the banks are the source of the social money supply and, 
more precisely, the central bank. 
  Thus, the central bank should now continue to carry out 
regulation and control of the total volume of credit in the 
whole society and use this to regulate and control the total 
volume of money supply in the whole society. As to regulation 
and control measures, of course we cannot continue to use 
management by quota. Rather, we should use mainly economic 
measures, such as central bank credit rates, deposit reserve 
rates, and open market business. Only by controlling the amount 
of credit and the volume of money supply in the whole society 
will it be possible to achieve a balance between total social 
supply and demand and will it be possible to achieve stability 
in currency value and in prices.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "Processing Trade Hits $80.6b, Up 13 Percent </F>
in `93] 
  [Text] China's processing trade showed a 13.4 percent 
growth in 1993, hitting $80.6 billion. 
  However, this was tempered by a narrowed surplus margin due 
to sluggish export prices, Chinese Customs announced yesterday. 
  The processing trade is defined as the importing of raw 
materials and processing them into higher value-added finished 
goods before exporting them. 
  The volume accounted for almost half of the country's 
overall 
foreign trade of $195.7 billion last year. 
  A large number of Chinese enterprises, mainly in the eastern 
coastal region, have been engaged in processing imported raw 
materials for exports during the last few years, taking 
advantage of local cheap labour. 
  There now seems to be potential, however, for more of the 
processing trade to extend into the hinterland areas, as coastal 
regions switch to more capital- and technological-intensive 
projects. 
  The Customs figures put China's surplus of processing trade 
at $7.9 billion, down from the 1992 level of $8.1 billion. 
  It was the third consecutive drop in such surplus since 
1991, 
and Customs officials have predicted a further decline despite 
continued growth of the export volume. 
  The exports in the processing trade picked up ll.7 percent 
to 
total $44.2 billion last year, accounting for 48 per cent of the 
country's overall exports. 
  The imported raw materials were valued at $36.3 billion, up 
15.4 percent. 
  The major export items (made of processed raw materials) 
included machinery and electronics, garments, shoes, textiles, 
dolls, luggage, plastic products and so on. 
  The exports of machinery and electronics made of foreign raw 
materials were $16.2 billion, making up 71.5 per cent of China's 
total exports in that sector. 
  The bulk of the country's overall exports of garments, 
luggage, shoes, dolls and woven units were made of raw materials 
which were supplied mainly by Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan and South 
Korea. 
  And nearly 94 per cent of China's processing trade was still 
centered in the coastal regions, like Guangdong, Jiangsu and 
Fujian provinces. 
  In particular, Guangdong Province offered two-thirds of the 
country's overall exports made of foreign raw materials. 
  More than half of the exports ended up in the United States, 
Japan and European Union (EU), with a combined value of $24.1 
billion. 
  And exports to Hong Kong reached $12.9 billion, 70 percent 
of 
which are being re-exported to the U.S., Japan and EU.

<F P=106> [Article by the Secretariat of the "Extensive and In-depth </F>
Survey of Economic Efficiency in China": "Cultivate the Lofty 
Aspiration of Improving Economic Efficiency" -- first paragraph 
is editor's note] 
  [Text] Raising economic efficiency is the central problem 
for economic work. Only when we direct the focus of economic 
work to raising economic efficiency and dealing conscientiously 
with the relationship between speed and efficiency can we 
maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy development [chi xu 
kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 
1455] of the national economy. In order to promote the raising 
of economic efficiency, as of today the committee for the 
extensive and in-depth survey of economic efficiency in China, 
and the RENMIN RIBAO Theoretical Department jointly open an 
"Economic Efficiency Forum" column. Readers' participation in 
this in-depth discussion on ways to raise economic efficiency in 
the form of articles is most welcome. 
  Raising economic efficiency was the premise and fundamental 
objective for Comrade Deng Xiaoping when he was outlining his 
blueprint on China's reform, development, and stability. It is 
a key integral part of his economic theory. In his southern 
inspection tour addresses in early 1992, with characteristic 
historical perception and courage to take on the future, Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping stressed more than once the problem of raising 
economic efficiency, and he urged the people of the whole 
nation: "In future modernization, it is both necessary and 
within our grasp to achieve a certain number of stages where 
there is a better rate of development and high economic 
efficiency. We must aspire to this!" 
  An intensive study of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's writings on 
raising economic efficiency helps us understand Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party Central Committee's overall 
strategic layout for speeding up the establishment of a 
socialist market economy system in order to promote economic 
development and social progress. 
<H3>  I. "Work for Efficiency in an Down-to-Earth Fashion" -- 
Relationship Between Efficiency and Development </H3>
  Speeding up development and turning our country into a 
socialist power were the lifelong ideals and goals for 
proletarian revolutionaries of the older generation like Mao 
Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping, as well as the main theme 
forever occupying a prominent space in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory and practice. In the late 1980's and early 1990's, 
socialist China was under external pressure: The international 
socialist movement had entered a low tide; the world's economy 
was moving into different blocs and increasingly integrated; and 
there was the rapid economic takeoff of the Asia-Pacific circle. 
There were also internal difficulties: Deep-layered economic 
contradictions remained; there was an irrational production 
structure; and there had been no fundamental improvement in the 
low economic efficiency. At this critical juncture, where 
challenges and opportunities coexisted and difficulties and 
hopes ran side by side, Comrade Deng Xiaoping repeatedly 
stressed the vital importance for China's future and fate of the 
general development goal of speeding up development and 
quadrupling the GDP. He made a series of expositions on how to 
speed up development and achieve the general strategic goal of 
quadrupling the GDP, a question that turns on the mode of 
development. 
  On how to achieve the general strategic goal of quadrupling 
the GDP, Comrade Xiaoping makes two fundamental requirements: 
First, according to the ideological line of seeking truth from 
facts, he stresses that the economic quadrupling must not be 
"diluted" but "real and solid," for he is "not encouraging high 
speed in disregard of practical conditions." Second, on the 
principle of the party serving the people, the fundamental 
criterion will be whether or not the people support and favor 
the program. He stresses that "doubling the GDP ultimately must 
be reflected in people's living standards, which is, moreover, a 
gradually rising one." "The people are highly sensitized to 
this problem. Our bookkeeping can in no way beat theirs, for 
theirs is the truest." These two fundamental requirements 
determine what Comrade Xiaoping stressed, that increasing the 
rate of development must be premised on raising economic 
efficiency, and the development rate he was stressing is of 
necessity one with good efficiency. Comrade Xiaoping has 
explained this clearly: 
  In the article "The First Decade as Preparation for the 
Following One," he pointed out clearly: "The target for our 
struggle should have been in place toward the last 20 years of 
this century, and that is quadrupling both industrial and 
agricultural output value under the premise of increasing 
economic efficiency." 
  In the article "All Tasks Must Be Conducive to the 
Establishment of Socialism With Chinese Characteristics," he 
pointed out: "We must attach importance to raising economic 
efficiency and should not go after only growth in output volume 
and value." 
  In his southern inspection tour addresses, he said: 
"Economic development in our country is such that every few 
years we will have to move into a new dimension. Of course, 
this does not mean that we are encouraging impractically high 
speed. We still have to be down-to-earth and value-efficient, 
and develop in a steady and coordinated fashion." 
On the question of how to speed up economic development, 
there have always been two models in the history of China's 
socialism: One is "rate-pulled efficiency." The 
traditional planned economy increased the rate of economic 
development mainly through expanding investment, opening up new 
fronts, and launching new projects. The economy was pulled into 
high-rate growth momentum by means of speed, and particularly by 
means of expanded fixed-asset investment, which naturally also 
raised economic efficiency. We can say that this model, through 
inertia, still plays a role to this day. Two, the 
"efficiency-propelled rate," raising economic efficiency through 
increasing internal reproduction capacity, and from it 
increasing the rate of economic development. This is precisely 
the model Comrade Xiaoping is advocating. In the Volume 3 
of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping brought up more than once the lesson of 1958, pointing 
out: "The development of `leftist' thought led to the `Great 
Leap' and People's Commune Movements in 1958. That was a big 
mistake, and we were punished for it. During the three years of 
natural calamities between 1959 and 1961, industrial and 
agricultural output went down, and there were only a few 
commodities on the market. People did not have enough to eat 
and their production motivation suffered." "Our objective is 
quite realistic, and raising people's living standards is a long 
struggle. The several mistakes we have made since the founding 
of the country all were caused by excessive zeal and 
unrealistically high targets, which did not match with China's 
practical conditions. Development actually was stalled." Only 
by adopting the "efficiency-propelled rate" model can we 
genuinely speed up the rate of economic development. This is 
the historical conclusion given us by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. 
  Guided by the spirit of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, the "CPC Central 
Committee's Decision on Certain Problems Related to Building a 
Socialist Market Economy System" also stresses the fundamental 
thinking of raising economic efficiency. The "Decision" 
stresses: It is necessary to "raise the proportion of financial 
revenue in the GDP through developing the economy, raising 
efficiency, and expanding sources of income." We must firmly 
bear in mind Comrade Deng Xiaoping's historical conclusion, 
based on his experience and high wisdom and on the spirit of the 
"Decision." Only the increase of rate premised on improved 
economic efficiency is a genuine "undiluted" increase in rate, a 
genuinely and solidly fast rate, not a false and illusory fast 
rate! The development of China's economy must follow this 
development model of a genuinely fast development rate! 
<H3>  II. "Once Reforms Are in Order; Efficiency Comes 
Automatically" -- Relations Between Efficiency and Reforms </H3>
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping never stressed development without 
simultaneously emphasizing reform, because development premised 
on the improvement of economic efficiency can be achieved only 
and primarily through reform. Development by external and 
extensive expansion typified by the blind pursuit of rate is 
achievable under a traditional planned system. We will 
understand better Comrade Xiaoping's series of expositions on 
speeding up reform and opening up if we approach them with 
raising economic efficiency as the controlling concept. 
  Efficiency is the ratio between input and output, and 
represents products or services demanded by society. In a 
traditional planned system, "high input, with low output and 
efficiency" remained entrenched and beyond touch. "Years of 
experience prove that the pat traditional system is incapable of 
developing productive forces." To raise economic efficiency and 
develop social productive forces, it is necessary to shatter the 
old planned economy system. As early as 1978, Comrade Xiaoping 
pointed out sharply: "To raise the economic development rate, 
it is necessary vigorously to pursue the specialization of 
enterprises, greatly improve the technical level of the work 
force, conscientiously train and test workers, tighten up 
enterprises' economic auditing, and raise the labor productivity 
and capital profitability rates. Therefore, there should be 
significant technological, institutional and organizational 
reforms on all fronts. The pursuit of these reforms represents 
the long-term interests of people throughout the country, else 
we will forever remain backward in production technology and 
management." He pointed out even more explicitly on a trip to 
Tianjin in 1986: "Tianjin Port has significantly raised its 
economic efficiency since its deregulation two years ago. The 
people and land remain the same, but economic efficiency was 
achieved through reform." Reform is the only and primary path 
through which economic efficiency can be raised. Therefore, 
Comrade Xiaoping said very firmly: "No one can stop China from 
continuing with its reform and opening up. Why? It is simple: 
There will be no development without reform and opening up; the 
economy will coast and reverse, and people's living standards 
will fall. The trend of reform is unchangeable." 
  The objective of reform is to establish a socialist market 
economy system, and raising economic efficiency is a basic 
requirement for establishing a socialist market economy system. 
As the ratio between input and output is determined primarily 
by the mode of resource allocation. Under a planned economy 
system, resources are allocated by a highly centralized 
administrative system, under which input and output cannot be 
rational, and there cannot be any economic efficiency (and in 
fact, there is none). Only under a socialist market economy 
system -- under which enterprises are economic entities that 
operate independently, and are responsible for their own profits 
and losses, development, and restraint -- can the improvement of 
economic efficiency become a fundamental objective for our 
economy. Based on Comrade Deng Xiaoping's scientific 
conclusion, the 14th party congress made the establishment of a 
socialist market economy system the objective for our country's 
structural reform. The "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee then outlined a basic 
framework for the socialist market economY system, thus 
providing an institutional guarantee for the improvement of 
economic efficiency. Speeding up the development of productive 
forces and raising economic efficiency through fundamental 
changes in resource allocation -- this is Comrade Xiaoping's 
outstanding and enormous contribution to the theory and practice 
of reform and opening up. 
  As reform necessarily requires raising economic efficiency, 
raising economic efficiency will provide a fundamental economic 
guarantee for the steady pursuit of reform. Comrade Xiaoping 
pointed out: "In the process of reform, it is good enough to 
keep production at a certain growth rate. We should not 
overreach our limits in the pursuit of high speed. Of course, 
it will not do if the rate is too low. The rate in the past 
decade was not low. If we can keep development at a relatively 
good rate for the next few years, we will run a much lower risk 
in deepening reform." Reform is the second revolution for our 
country. It involves an adjustment in the interest pattern and 
an economic reintegration. Therefore, reform must promote the 
improvement of economic efficiency in order to create a less 
demanding situation against which the deepening of reform 
proceeds. Otherwise there will be capital shortages and weak 
markets, seriously affecting the reform process. This is the 
underlying truth of Comrade Xiaoping's famous dictum "once 
reform is in order, efficiency comes automatically." 
  Based on Comrade Xiaoping's thoughts, the "CPC Central 
Committee Decision on Certain Problems Related to the 
Establishment of a Socialist Market Economy System" pointed out 
explicitly: "Enterprises run production and operations according 
to market demand, and in pursuit of raising labor productivity 
and economic efficiency." "The development of our rural economy 
has entered a stage characterized by structural adjustment and 
raising economic efficiency. The rural economy must adapt to 
changes in market demand for agricultural products; optimize its 
product mix; and develop agriculture in the direction of high 
yield, high quality, and high efficiency." This embodies the 
fundamental requirement for establishing a socialist market 
economy system to raise economic efficiency, as well as the 
close inner relations between deepening reform and raising 
economic efficiency. 
<H3>  III. "What Hazards Could There Be if We Are Mindful of 
Economic Efficiency?" -- Relationship Between Economic 
Efficiency and Stability </H3>
  Both reform and development require a stable environment. 
Basically, growth in social productive forces and considerable 
improvement in economic efficiency will provide a fundamental 
guarantee for social and economic stability. As Comrade 
Xiaoping said: Regarding treatment of social environment, the 
real and ultimate way lies in improving the economy." 
  First, we can avoid serious economic damage and 
fluctuations if increases in the rate of economic development 
are premised on raising economic efficiency. Comrade 
Xiaoping said: "One of the things we learn from our experience 
is that we should be able to see where problems might come from, 
even when development is going well. Development must proceed at 
the right pace. Problems will arise when the economy is 
overheated. In short, be practical when formulating policies. 
As long as we can do that, we will not make big mistakes." He 
said on his Tianjin tour: "What hazards could there be, even if 
one or two localities borrow $10 billion or so in 10 years, if 
they are mindful of economic efficiency? There is nothing to 
worry about, even if they borrow $20 billion." Thus raising 
economic efficiency was made the premise and fundamental 
guarantee for preventing economic hazards. Early last year, 
Comrade Xiaoping said in Shanghai: "In economic work, we must 
seize opportunities and accelerate development while keeping an 
eye on stability so as to avoid damage, especially serious 
damage." Thus we are further reminded that we must really carry 
out the job of raising economic efficiency in economic 
development. 
  Second, if economic development is based on higher 
economic efficiency, it will guarantee the improvement of 
people's living standards and will promote social stability and 
unity. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out emphatically: "The 
most fundamental element is the rate of economic growth, the 
benefit of which, moreover, must be reflected in people's 
gradually rising living standards. People will settle down when 
they witness the benefits of stability and of the current 
institutions and policies. If we can do that, then whatever 
changes there may be in the international major climate, things 
will be steady as a rock." 
  What needs to be pointed out and emphasized is that while 
raising economic efficiency is an economic problem, it is also a 
process that calls for a spirit of arduous enterprise and 
involves fight against corruption. This is highly significant 
for the pursuit of socialist spiritual civilization. Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping pointed out sharply as early as 1980: "The drive 
against privileges is only one of the aspects of arduous 
enterprise. The biggest problem is how to stamp out waste, 
raise labor productivity, cut the output of products for which 
there is no demand and of junk products not meeting quality 
requirements, reduce total costs, and raise the rate of capital 
utilization. We must make everyone understand how hard it was 
for us to obtain this capital and make these products. Any kind 
of waste is a crime." In 1985, he pointed out: "A too- rapid 
development rate causes many problems, and affects reforms and 
social climate. It is better to be slower, but more stable. 
The scale of fixed-asset investment must be kept under control. 
Do not overstretch ourselves in launching capital construction. 
Management and quality get top priority. Only a development 
rate that helps both economic efficiency and social benefits is 
genuine." He said in 1989: "The more developed we are, the 
more we must emphasize arduous enterprise. Advocating a spirit 
of arduous enterprise helps overcome corruption. Since the 
founding of the country, we have been advocating the spirit of 
arduous enterprise. Later, when things improved, we started 
encouraging high consumption, and there was waste everywhere." 
Raising economic efficiency and fighting corruption are 
completely identical. Only then can we genuinely unify the 
masses and build socialist spiritual civilization, and hence 
promote the triumphant march of the socialist cause and the 
stability and unity of society as a whole. 
  Our country is at a critical juncture where the planned 
economy is changing toward a socialist market economy system and 
the traditional development model is changing to a modernized 
one. Raising economic efficiency is a premise and guarantee of 
fundamental import for our reform, development, and stability. 
We should actively conduct studies, investigations, and 
publicity campaigns for the effort to raise economic efficiency, 
and should include such an effort as part of our action 
programs, and hence promote the sustained, rapid, healthy 
development [chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 
6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of our country's economy.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Wang Yong: "Exports in Surge, but </F>
Deficit Lingers"] 
  [Text] China's exports surged upward in January, but 
remained short of imports, resulting in a deficit of $900 
million, it was announced yesterday. 
  The 14.5 per cent growth over the first month of 1993 
(adjusted for holidays) indicated a rare recovery of the 
nation's exports, which were teetering throughout last year, 
trade officials said. 
  The General Administration of Customs put last month's 
exports at $4.8 billion. 
  Imports soared by a massive 42.3 percent to $5.7 billion in 
January. 
  Customs officials did not say whether China will be able to 
sustain a trade balance for this year. The country sustained a 
deficit of $12.2 billion last year, the first since 1989. 
  According to Customs, January's export surge was still led 
by 
foreign-funded enterprises, which numbered more than 170,000 
nationwide by the end of 1993. Their exports rose 55.2 percent 
to $1.49 billion, or 31 percent of the nation's total. 
  At the same time, exports by State-run and other types of 
enterprises managed a 2.5 percent growth to reach $3.3 billion, 
Customs said. 
  This compared favourably with last year, when exports posted 
negative growth partly due to high export costs. 
  Most of these enterprises shifted to a more lucrative 
domestic market buoyed by a 13 percent growth rate in the gross 
domestic product (GDP) last year. 
  Customs officials said China's move to curb credit since 
last 
July and the unification of foreign exchange rates last month 
were major factors behind the export growth. 
  The exports of finished industrial products jumped by 18.7 
percent to $4.04 billion, while those of primary products 
dropped 3.9 percent to $760 million. 
  Broken down, the exports of garments, machinery and 
electronic products grew by some 22 percent each. 
  But the exports of traditional high-growth items, like 
shoes, 
luggage and dolls plateaued. 
  Crude oil, oil products, coal and other fossil fuel sectors 
saw exports go down, but still some other primary products like 
foodstuffs saw an increase in exports. 
  The country's exports via barter trade plummeted 37.5 
percent 
from January last year to $80 million. 
  It was the barter trade, which enjoys certain preferential 
tax policies, that had attracted a considerable part of China's 
exports last year. 
  But barter trade usually does not produce foreign exchange 
for the State coffer. 
  The country obtains foreign exchange cash mainly from 
general 
trade. The exports in this form saw a sharp recovery last month 
to $2.18 billion, up 18.9 percent. 
  Overall, China's exports are apparently on the way to a 
steady growth, but analysts said the State-run companies have 
yet to make further progress. 
  It is still not easy to root out a deficit should exports 
fail to chalk up a higher speed, especially when imports are 
continuing to surge, trade officials said. 
  But Customs showed that the import boom was led by the 
foreign-funded enterprises, which do not use the State's foreign 
exchange reserves. 
  Imports by these ventures jumped 116 percent last month to 
$1.07 billion. 
  And the imports of raw materials for processing rose by 46.2 
percent to $2.14 billion.

  [Text] Beijing, February 17 (XINHUA) -- The economic 
returns for China's manufacturing sector improved markedly last 
year as its industrial production continued to grow fast, 
according to an official report. 
  The comprehensive economic returns index for China's 
manufacturing industries reached 96.6 in 1993, an increase of 
about 7 percentage points over the previous year, said a report 
jointly issued by the State Statistics Bureau, the State 
Planning Commission and the State Economic and Trade Commission. 
  The report, which was released here today, said that profits 
and taxes made and handed over by industrial firms at and above 
the township levels increased by 36.8 percent last year over the 
previous year. Profits made by the firms totalled 145.2 billion 
yuan (about 16.68 billion U.S. dollars), up 62.4 percent over 
the previous year. 
  The comprehensive economic returns index for China's large 
and medium-sized enterprises climbed to 106, about 9 percentage 
points above the country's average. 
  The report said that this shows the advantages of those 
firms 
in production scale, management, technology and equipment. 
  The comprehensive economic returns index for industrial 
enterprises of other ownerships including foreign-funded firms 
is 134, 37 percentage points higher than the country's average. 
  In comparison, collectively-owned industrial firms in China 
are still falling behind in economic performance. 
  According to the report, heavy industry performed better 
than 
light industry and the gap between them has been gradually 
narrowed. 
  Driven by excessive investment in fixed assets and growing 
demand, heavy industry recorded better production performance 
and sales of products. Its economic returns are much better 
than light industry. 
  Statistics show that the comprehensive economic returns 
index 
for heavy industry is about 103, compared with 93 for light 
industry. 
  About one quarter of heavy industry is operating at a loss, 
compared with 36 percent of light industrial firms in the red. 
  The State Statistics Bureau said that industrial growth is 
still characterized by extensive development, low economic 
returns and imbalance. The improvement of economic returns 
depends on the expansion of production scales and price rises. 
  Officials attributed the low economic returns to increasing 
expenditure by industrial firms and their decreasing profits. 
  They said that irrational industrial structure is still an 
outstanding factor affecting the improvement of economic returns 
since at present the country's total supply meets the total 
demand. 
  Excessive investment and irrational investment structure and 
revenue distribution systems are responsible for the problems, 
the officials said. 
  The report said China should maintain a reasonable 
industrial 
growth rate and pay more attention to the improvement of 
economic returns so that industrial production will grow in a 
sustained, fast and healthy way.

<F P=106> [Article by JINGJI RIBAO reporter Li Zhengping (2621 3630 </F>
1627) and XINHUA reporter Jiang Jun (1203 6511): "Look at 
Opening Up From the Country's Door -- Describing the Reform of 
the System of Passing Through Customs"] 
  [Excerpts] Beijing, 10 Feb (XINHUA) -- China's busiest 
entry-exit port -- Luohu customs -- has formally opened its new 
passenger passageway. In the spacious hall, several passageways 
eight to 18 meters wide have replaced the original 72 customs 
inspection counters and more than 100 banisters. Passengers 
going from the mainland to Hong Kong or going from Hong Kong to 
the mainland can now pass through customs -- the "door to the 
country" -- swiftly and easily. 
  This is a profile of Chinese customs' efforts to expedite 
passage through customs. 
  1. In the Huanggang area of Shenzhen, which has the largest 
highway port in Asia, a cargo truck can pass through customs in 
only 20 seconds. [passage omitted] 
  At China's Shekou port, which handles the largest number of 
ships and boats in China, customs officials no longer go aboard 
ships to carry out inspections. Therefore, foreign ships' time 
in port has been reduced greatly. [passage omitted] 
  The speed in passing through customs is an important point 
in 
judging the extent of opening up to the outside world. An 
open-type country will certainly ask its customs officials to 
provide the greatest convenience for the legitimate entry and 
exit of people, cargo, and means of transportation. 
  2. To speed up the passage through customs, decreasing 
inspections plays an important part. [passage omitted] 
  Luohu customs head He Tangfa said: We have now adopted the 
method of the "selective inspection of key cases." We simply 
removed those customs counters which allowed only one person to 
pass, and we now allow passengers to pass through freely. 
Meanwhile, we have strengthened on-the-spot investigation and 
study. When we find doubtful pieces of luggage, we will use 
equipment to inspect them. We call it "controlling the key 
things and letting the little things pass freely." In this way, 
the overwhelming majority of passengers can pass through customs 
without being checked. [passage omitted] 
  3. The speeded-up passage through customs is based on a 
decrease in inspections. However, customs' responsibility has 
not decreased. Customs officers have not reduced their efforts, 
and their achievements have increased. 
  Shekou customs head Huang Haitao told a reporter that after 
implementing the new system for supervising and controlling 
international shipping, customs officials can now concentrate 
their forces and emphasize the inspection of key areas which 
were not handled seriously due to a lack of manpower. In just 
over one month, customs officials uncovered several major 
smuggling cases involving goods valued at over 80 million yuan. 
  The situation with Huanggang customs is quite similar. 
Outwardly, customs officers do not inspect most vehicles. Cargo 
trucks' drivers only have to hand over a list of their goods to 
customs officers and then can pass through in less than one 
minute. Empty vehicles can pass through using special lanes 
without being stopped. Customs officials, however, have not 
neglected their duty. They have strengthened on-the-spot 
investigation and intelligence work and have placed emphasis on 
cracking down on major smuggling cases. During the first 11 
months of 1993, they uncovered more than 1,400 smuggling cases 
-- a total that was 70 percent higher than in the previous year 
-- in which the value of the goods confiscated exceeded 110 
million yuan. 
  The speeding up of passage through customs must also depend 
on strong management. Jiulong [Kowloon] customs can open its 
door wide because it has paid attention to checking and 
controlling the enterprises concerned. The customs office has 
established files and knows very well which enterprises have 
good reputations and which earlier have engaged in crimes of 
smuggling. In this way, the customs office can handle different 
cases under different categories.

<F P=106> [By special reporter Chun Liang (0193 5328): "Experts Call </F>
For Abandonment of Import Substitute Strategy To Catch Up With 
International Level of Industrial Technology"] 
  [Text] At a recently convened internal forum on the 
development strategy for China's foreign trade and economic ties 
in the nineties, senior trade and economic experts one after 
another urged the authorities to change the concept and 
completely abandon the current "closed-type" import substitute 
policy. 
  From the period when the CPC came to power to 1978, China 
accomplished the early-phase industrialization by implementing 
the import substitute strategy; since reform and opening up, 
through importing technology to transform heavy and chemical 
industries, China accomplished the process of "import for 
replacement." At present, the third-phase industrialization has 
begun, and it is a phase in which heavy and chemical industries 
are the main body and labor-intensive and technology-intensive 
industries are the two wings for realizing the high degree of 
industrial processing which is characteristic of 
industrialization in the later phase. For this reason, it is 
necessary to accomplish the change from importing technologies 
for petrochemical, mechanical, and electronic industries to 
exporting them, and to let light and textile industries provide 
foreign exchange to technology-intensive industries. 
  The "closed-type" import substitute strategy stresses 
complete domestic manufacturing under state protection after 
importing technology. Under the conditions that technological 
progress in the international community takes place rapidly, 
that modern industrial sectors involve sophisticated technology 
and many production links, and that there are strict demands for 
raw materials, spare parts, and examining and testing measures, 
domestic manufacturing is not only costly, but also 
time-consuming, leading to the vicious cycle of 
"import--domestic manufacturing--backwardness--import again." 
  Chinese economic and trade experts have now proposed a new 
"open-type import substitute strategy," that is, strength will 
be first concentrated to enable certain spare parts or 
processing stages to reach the world's advanced level, to enter 
the international market, and to become a part of the global 
industrial system, and through this to monitor the development 
trends of the world's industrial technology and products; then 
steps will be taken to enable overall manufacturing to reach the 
world's advanced standard. Therefore, the development of 
technology-intensive industries in the nineties must aim at 
participation in high-level division of labor in the 
international community, not just simplistic pursuit of the rate 
of domestic manufacturing.

<F P=106> [By Robert J. Saiget] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, Feb. 17 KYODO -- China's growing coal 
consumption poses a huge threat to the environment, a leading 
Chinese official said recently, and things are bound to get 
worse as the country struggles to generate enough energy to fuel 
its booming economy. 
  "Our biggest environmental problem is coal. You cannot deny 
that in the next 20 to 30 years coal use will continue to grow," 
Yang Jike, vice chairman of the environmental protection 
committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC) said in an 
interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE. 
  "We have lots of coal...To generate electricity it's the 
cheapest," he said. "Coal is easy to get, you only have to dig." 
  China used between 1.1 and 1.2 billion tons of coal in 1993, 
mostly for heating and generating electricity. Industry sources 
predict China will consume as much as 1.5 to 1.6 billion tons by 
the year 2000. 
  Coal burning emits several harmful air pollutants including 
carbon dioxide (Co2), a major contributor to the global warming 
or "greenhouse effect," and sulfur dioxide (So2), the main cause 
of acid rain, which destroys the nutritional value of soil and 
pollutes rivers and lakes. 
  "As far as I'm concerned, laws are the only way to restrict 
the rapid development of the coal industry. We can also use 
laws and regulations to encourage development of renewable 
energy sources such as hydroelectric power, wind, tidal, 
geothermal power and biogas, as well as nuclear power plants," 
Yang said. 
  The threat of excessive dependence on coal is of such a 
serious nature that Yang sees the construction of nuclear power 
plants and the environmentally controversial Three Gorges dam -- 
set to be the world's largest -- as necessary projects to limit 
coal use in China. 
  Despite nearly universal ignorance of environmental concerns 
among the general masses, Yang stressed the Chinese Government's 
commitment to environmental protection, citing its signing of 
the UN-sponsored framework convention on climate change and the 
convention on biological diversity at the 1992 Earth Summit in 
Rio de Janeiro. 
  The 1993 establishment of the NPC Environmental Protection 
Committee places priority on environmental legislation aimed at 
controlling pollution and protecting natural resources, he said. 
  New construction projects in China now must first have an 
environmental impact statement approved, he said, while several 
draft laws will lay down standards for solid waste disposal, air 
and water pollution as well as standards for resource 
exploitation. 
  China's environmental protection is an uphill battle against 
not only the demands of rapid economic development and growing 
energy use, but subject to the tremendous pressures of a 
massive, largely uneducated agrarian population which feeds the 
nation on only 7 percent of the world's arable land. 
  Chemical fertilizers, deforestation and indiscriminate 
strip- 
mining are leading to rapid soil erosion, while new highly- 
productive seed varieties are diminishing genetic variety while 
increasing the susceptibility of entire crops to a number of 
destructive plant viruses. 
  Although Yang is careful to support the party's official 
policy of fast, healthy and stable economic growth, "my own 
opinion is that we don't want to develop too fast," he says. 
"Ten percent growth is too fast. I hope we can control growth 
to keep it below that level, ideally in the range of 6 percent." 
  "We are faced with a very critical environmental situation," 
Yang said. "Our challenge is to do our best to overcome this 
serious situation," he said.

  [Text] Beijing, February 16 (XINHUA) -- The number of 
exchanges where property rights can be bought and sold has kept 
rising in China in recent years. 
  Latest figures show that there are now 25 property rights 
exchanges in China, with Henan, Shanghai, Nanjing, Shandong, 
Chengdu, Shenzhen and Zhejiang as the regional centers. 
  Recently, 30 big financial organizations and enterprise 
groups decided jointly to sponsor the China International 
Property Rights Exchange Center in Beijing, which will be a 
national property exchange market. 
  The sponsors include the China Economic Development Trust 
and 
Investment Corporation, the Shenzhen Baoan (Group) Corporation, 
the China Everbright International Trust and Investment 
Corporation, and the Hangzhou Waitan Construction Co. Ltd. 
  Under the old planned economy system, state-owned fixed 
assets could not be circulated. Statistics show that about one 
third of the state-owned property is idle at present, seriously 
affecting the efficiency of enterprises. 
  The country's first property rights exchange was formed in 
the early 1980s. Thanks to property rights exchanges, over 
6,900 enterprises were merged in the 1980s. Their property 
rights, worth over eight billion yuan, were transferred. As a 
result, the number of enterprises in the red dropped by 4,095 
and the annual level of losses by state-owned enterprises was 
reduced by 522 million yuan. 
  Since the beginning of the 1990s, over 10,000 enterprises 
have been merged. More than 2,900 enterprises were sold and 
merged through the 16 property rights exchanges in Tianjin, 
Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Shenzhen and other places of the 
country. Many of the enterprises have been revitalized after 
being merged or sold. 
  With the development of the property rights business, China 
has promulgated a series of relevant laws and regulations on 
bankruptcy, company and state enterprises. 
  Economists believe that the development of the property 
rights business will play a more and more important role in 
re-organization of the country's productive factors and in 
development of the country's productivity.

This has disrupted the normal order of the compact disk

  Through investigation, this reporter has discovered that in 
1992 China had only one CD production factory, the Xianke 
Corporation in Shenzhen. Later, there were three factories and 
three production lines. By the end of 1993, however, the 
figures jumped to 25 factories and 30 production lines. 
  What impact do 30 production lines have on the CD market? In 
1992 the total annual CD sales in China were around 3 million, 
but a Xianke CD production line in Shenzhen alone had an annual 
production capacity of 5 million CDs. We can thus see that even 
if the domestic CD sales market grows several fold, a few CD 
production factories can sufficiently saturate the market. 
  What is terrible, however, is that in less than 18 months 10 
times as many production lines have emerged, with a full-load 
production capacity of nearly 100 million CDs. Moreover, new CD 
production lines are still being imported. 
  In March 1993 the State Planning Commission and the 
department concerned studied the issue of importing CD 
production lines. Taking into consideration the domestic market 
demands at that time, the commission explicitly stipulated that 
before the country's overall development plan for CD players and 
laser disk players is promulgated, no department or locality may 
approve the construction of new factories and the expansion of 
existing production capacity. After the planning commission 
document was transmitted to the lower levels, some localities 
and departments, in total disregard of the document provisions, 
blindly approved the construction of CD production factories, 
with the result that CD output far outstripped domestic market 
demands. What was especially serious was that some unscrupulous 
overseas businessmen have taken advantage of the opportunity to 
make an inroad and engage in large-scale pirating activities. 
This has not only disrupted the domestic video market, but also 
the international disk market. The Shanghai office of the 
International Disk Industrial Association recently officially 
brought a suit in the Shanghai Municipal Intermediate People's 
Court against a certain Taiwan businessman called Hsu for 
carrying out illegal pirating activities on the mainland. Hsu 
was tracked down by the Taiwan authorities for carrying out 
illegal disk pirating activities in Taiwan. Pending trial, Hsu 
entered China in early 1993 and engaged in illegal CD copying 
activities. While serving as deputy general manager of business 
at Baodie Laser and Electronics Company Limited, a Sino-foreign 
joint venture in Suzhou City, Jiangsu Province, he provided the 
company with the masters of programs produced by the 
International Disk Industrial Association, which has the right 
over the programs, and copied 121,000 CDs in 35 varieties. He 
also accepted a processing task for Huadie Guangdian Company 
Limited, a Sino-foreign joint venture in Hangzhou, and produced 
18,000 CDs in 14 varieties. Most of the copied and pirated CDs 
have entered the international market. 
  At present, the issue of illegally importing CD production 
lines has drawn the close attention of the relevant government 
department. The department deems it necessary to immediately 
stop importing CD production lines from abroad and exercise 
strict and necessary standardized management over CD factories 
currently in production and operation. Otherwise, the factories 
will face the risk of bankruptcy and it will be impossible to 
curb piracy in some domestic markets.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Senior Officials Deny That China Will </F>
Return to the Old Path of State Monopoly for the Purchase and 
Marketing of Grain, and Stress That Private Businessmen Can 
Still Engage in the Business of Purchasing Grain"] 
  [Text] Chinese officials concerned yesterday told MING PAO 
that in the field of grain distribution, China would never 
return to the previous practice of state-monopolized purchase 
and sale (that is, all grain to be purchased and sold by the 
state according to unified plans). However, when obvious 
instability appears in the supply of grain and when the 
situation affects the national economy and the people's 
livelihood, the authorities will use the reserve grain in 
granaries to increase the market supply and stabilize and 
control market prices. 
  According to a recent report by a Hong Kong newspaper, the 
Beijing Municipal authorities drew a lesson from the sharp 
increase in grain prices late last year, and decided that grain 
could only be purchased by the State Council's Ministry of Grain 
at prices controlled by the state. No private businesses would 
be allowed to engage in grain purchase (but grain retail 
business would still be free). 
  However, a senior official of the State Council told MING 
PAO 
reporters yesterday that it was inaccurate to say that no 
private businesses are allowed to engage in grain purchase. 
  He said: On the open grain market, after grain prices were 
decontrolled, the state still seriously purchased grain. At the 
same time, however, the authorities did not prohibit or restrain 
any individual businesses from engaging in grain purchase. The 
official said that governments in all countries attach great 
importance to peasants' interests and to protecting the 
development of agriculture in their own countries. 
  Recently, peasants in Japan and South Korea staged protests 
against the importation of rice from foreign countries, but this 
did not mean that grain purchase should be monopolized by the 
state and individual businesses should not be allowed to engage 
in grain purchase. 
  A provincial official in Sichuan said that he did not 
believe 
China would return to the old practice of state-monopolized 
grain purchase and marketing. Last year, Sichuan's grain output 
reached 82 billion jin, and the free grain purchase and sale was 
welcomed by all parties concerned. 
  He added: At present, each 100 jin of rice is purchased at 
40-odd yuan in Sichuan, and the retail price of rice is between 
0.70 and 0.80 yuan per jin, and the prices remain rather stable. 
  Hunan is one of China's major grain-producing provinces. 
Last year, Hunan's rice output exceeded 50 billion jin. A 
provincial official in charge of agriculture said that so far, 
they had not received any central instruction on changing the 
grain purchase and marketing policy. 
  He said that even if the state sold part of the reserve 
grain 
on the market, this would only serve the purpose of stabilizing 
grain prices. He believed that in the future, the state and 
individual businesses would continue to be involved in grain 
purchase and marketing as at present. 
  He added that after Hunan rescinded the monopolized grain 
purchase and sale policy in November 1992, reactions from all 
quarters concerned were favorable. At present, the purchase 
price of rice is 45 yuan per 100 jin; and the retail price of 
rice is 0.75 yuan per jin. The price of rice is stable on the 
whole. 
  An official in Anhui Province said that local peasants did 
not want to see the return of the previous monopolized grain 
purchase and sale policy. Since grain prices were decontrolled 
in the first half of last year, grain prices have remained 
stable on the whole. At present, the retail price of rice is 
between 0.70 and 0.80 yuan per jin. Last year, Anhui's grain 
output was nearly 60 billion jin.

<F P=106> ["Special Dispatch" From Beijing: "A Central Leader Reveals </F>
That Purchase Prices for Grain and Cotton Will Be Increased by a 
Large Margin"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 16 Feb (TA KUNG PAO)--A central leader 
said recently: The main tasks for 1994 rural economic 
development are: To strive for good harvests in agriculture, to 
achieve a sustained and healthy development of township 
enterprises, to promote rural markets, and to boost the 
peasants' per-capita net income. To fulfill these tasks, it is 
necessary to take four measures as follows. 
  1. Increase inputs into agriculture and the rural economy by 
a fairly large margin. The budgeted investment in capital 
construction as well as the funds and bank loans set aside to 
aid agriculture should also be increased. Specific arrangements 
must be made with respect to planning and monetary and financial 
matters. 
  2. Increase grain and cotton purchase prices. When new 
grain goes on the market in 1994, the guaranteed price for grain 
will begin to go up by a fairly large margin. The measures for 
increasing the price of cotton ordered by the state will also be 
published in time. 
  3. Improving the special grain reserve system. It is 
necessary to lower domestic market prices of grain and promote 
steady growth in grain production through adjusting the amount 
of grain purchased and sold and utilizing the swap market 
mechanism for grain at home and abroad. Efforts should also be 
made to establish market risk funds for grain, to protect the 
peasants' interests to arouse their enthusiasm for production, 
and to guarantee the normal operation of the special grain 
reserve system. And, 
  4. Establish banks whose sole function is to make 
low-interest loans for agricultural development. This is an 
essential measure to ensure that we have sufficient funds for 
purchasing agricultural and sideline products. We should step 
up specific preparations for the establishment of such banks. 
  Plans for rural reforms -- such as developing diverse forms 
of collectivized agricultural services, setting up cooperative 
and joint stock economic entities, reforming the system of 
supply and marketing cooperatives, and reforming certain 
management systems to promote developments of small towns -- 
should be formulated and implemented step by step. 
  The central leader pointed out: As peasants constitute the 
main segment of China's population, the problem concerning 
agricultural development is of vital importance to the overall 
situation. Whether there is comprehensive development of 
agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, 
and fishery and whether there are good harvests in agriculture 
all have a direct bearing on prices and the people's daily life. 
Rapid economic growth depends on opening up rural markets, but 
the latter depends on developing the rural economy and 
increasing the peasants' income. Over the past few years we 
have enjoyed successive bumper harvests and a sustained 
development of the rural economy, but the comparative efficiency 
of grain production has declined; the gap between the prices of 
agricultural and industrial products has widened; and the 
peasants' income has grown rather slowly. We must take 
effective measures to solve all these problems.

  [Text] Jiangxi has achieved dramatic results in resolving 
civilian conflicts and armed disputes. Last year 35 civilian 
conflicts and armed disputes took place, leaving eight dead and 
causing direct economic losses of 140,000 yuan, a decrease of 
respectively 66 percent, 62 percent, and 79 percent as compared 
with the previous year. In preventing civilian conflicts and 
armed disputes, all levels of the departments were firm in 
implementing the central and provincial arrangements, were quick 
to act, and were efficient in their measures. 
  Early last year, the provincial government signed agreements 
with the relevant prefectural, city, and provincial departments 
on preventing and mediating civilian conflicts and armed 
disputes. They organized personnel to mediate and resolve 29 
cases of civilian conflicts. Ganzhou, Jian, and Jingdezhen 
authorities conducted a no-armed-dispute campaign this year, and 
they were successful.

  [Text] Haikou, February 15 (CNS)--Hainan will boost its 
vast spending on power generation this year with the planned 
capacity of generating sets to be installed put at 400,000 
kilowatts. The tense state regarding power consumption which 
has surfaced throughout the province since the second half of 
last year will then be basically alleviated. 
  A Hainan pivotal project for a hydroelectric power station 
and water conservancy as well as part of the generating sets for 
the Sanya Power Station, all of which are now under 
construction, will go into operation this year. The 
120,000-kilowatt generating set which is kerosene-powered at the 
Haimei Power Station and two 100,000-kilowatt geneating sets at 
the Dongfang Power Plant will be solely funded by foreign 
investors for their construction this year. The kerosene-powered 
generating set installed at the Haimei Power Station is expected 
to go into operation by the end this year. 
  It is expected that construction will start in the first 
half 
of this year on two 125,000-kilowatt generating sets involved in 
the 3d phase expansion of the Haikou Power Plant. Three 
generating sets each with a capacity of 20,000 kilowatts at the 
Gezhen Hydroelectric Station will be under construction sometime 
between late this year and early next year while two 
30,000-kilowatt generating sets at the Basuo Power Plant will be 
constructed late this year. 
  The Hainan authorities also plan to bring in foreign capital 
for exploitation of nuclear power with the selection of a site 
for the first nuclear power station to be completed this year. 
A feasibility study will be carried out for the first-phase 
project which involves a 300,000-kilowatt generating sets.

  [Text] Changsha, February 16 (XINHUA) -- Agricultural 
science and education centers have sprung up all over central 
China's Hunan Province in a bid to promote high-yield 
agriculture. 
  Last year some 500 township agroscience and education 
centers 
were set up in the province. 
  Now over 2,200 towns have set up such centers, 70 percent of 
the total number of towns in Hunan. 
  The centers play an important role in promoting advanced 
farming techniques and training in rural areas. 
  In 1993 Hunan Province built 251 farm technical training and 
demonstration areas based on the centers to introduce 1,057 new 
farming techniques and help 200,000 households to get rich. 
  The use of the new techniques has helped increase 
agricultural output value by 450 million yuan. 
  After learning the techniques of growing elevated gastrodia 
tubers over 30 farm households in Linjiang town, in the Tongdao 
Dong nationality autonomous county, made an average income of 
nearly 20,000 yuan per household only by planting the Chinese 
medicinal herb last year. 
  The farmers' per capita income in Youxian County was over 
1,000 yuan after they learned to use new techniques of grain 
production, making it one of the richest counties in eastern 
Hunan.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 17 (YONHAP) -- China, seeking to improve 
its naval forces, will import three attack submarines from 
Russia this year and send some 100 sub crew members to the 
Russian Navy's submarine school in Vladivostok this summer, the 
TOKYO SHIMBUN reported on Thursday in a Vladivostok-datelined 
story. 
  The three submarines China will purchase are conventional 
"kilo" class ships, weighing 3,000 tons, able to cruise at 17 
knots and built at the Komsomolsk shipyard in Khabarovsk in 
1982, the report said, citing a ranking officer of the Russian 
Pacific fleet in Vladivostok. 
  Russia will send the vessels to China for foreign exchange, 
with their cooperation in submarine warfare involving many naval 
secrets likely to influence the security of East Asian nations, 
the Japanese-language newspaper said. 
  China is known to have plans to import 10 more conventional 
submarines and one nuclear submarine from Russia within the 
year, it said. 
  The Russian Pacific fleet sold seven warships to China last 
year, including a ballistic rocket observation ship, a destroyer 
and two conventional submarines. 
  These ships are serviceable in naval operations and China 
must have commissioned them for its navy, instead of using them 
for scrap iron, the Pacific fleet officer was quoted as saying. 
  The Russian Navy's submarine school in Vladivostok was set 
up 
in the early 1980s to train submarine crews from countries 
purchasing Russian subs.

Hui-yen (2582 1979 3601): Beijing Transfers Military Brass in a 
Big Way To Consolidate Jiang's Position as the Core"] 
  [Text] New York 14 Feb (LIEN HO PAO) -- According to a 
report carried in the latest issue of ZHONGGUO JUSHI [0022 0948 
1444 0528 CHINA'S SITUATION] to be published here in New York 
soon, another large-scale round of transfers among the military 
brass of the People's Liberation Army [PLA], which began late 
last year, is still under way. According to the principle of 
being younger in average age, Jiang Zemin has continued to 
establish his influence in the Army, while the influence of "the 
Yangs" [Yang Shangkun, former President and formerly permanent 
vice chairman and secretary general of the CPC Central Military 
Commission; and his half-brother, Yang Baibing, former director 
of the PLA General Political Department and former member of the 
PRC Central Military Commission], and of those soldiers who rose 
in the wake of the "4 June" incident has weakened further. The 
most important cause lies in ensuring that the leading body, 
with Jiang Zemin as the core, promptly obtains the military's 
support after Deng Xiaoping. At the same time, the transfer of 
military brass will be conducive to cooperation among various 
military regions. This point finds obvious expression in the 
transfers of personnel in the Nanjing and Guangzhou Military 
Regions, which have been the main force aimed at Taiwan. 
  The journal ZHONGGUO JUSHI indicated that three wide-scale 
transfers of military brass already have taken place since the 
"4 June" incident in 1989. With the development of military 
strength, and with China's superem leader Deng Xiaoping -- who 
is nearly 90 -- having one foot in the grave, the hidden 
political motive in these transfers of military brass is worth 
studying. The current personnel reshuffle involves the Central 
Military Commission organizations and all major military 
regions. The outside world believes that compared with his 
predecessors -- Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang -- Jiang Zemin has 
less military background, but when Jiang Zemin acquired the 
legally constituted authority of the Central Military 
Commission, he stepped up the establishment and expandsion of 
his influence, with the backing of Deng Xiaoping. Viewing the 
present conditions, we find that his relations with the military 
have gone far beyond the imagination of the outside world. 
  As for the three rounds of military brass transfers since 
the 
"4 June" incident, the first round was conducted exclusively by 
Yang Shangkun and Yang Baibing, and Jiang Zemin basically had no 
say in it. When the "14th party congress" was in session, "the 
Yangs" were defeated by the joint forces of Jiang Zemin, Li 
Peng, and other military brass. In the wake of the congress, 
Jiang Zemin seized the opportunity to conduct the most 
wide-ranging military reshuffle since the PRC's founding, with 
focus on purging the forces of "the Yangs." In the latest round 
of reshuffling, Jiang Zemin was playing the card of "being 
younger in average age, and more professional," and a number of 
the military brass who had solid and extensive personnel 
networks were removed from office on the grounds of "exceeding 
the retirement age." Included in this category were Song Keda, 
political commissar of the Shenyang Military Region, and Wang 
Chengbin, commander of the Beijing Military Region -- both of 
whom were 66 years old; and Liu Anyuan, political commissar of 
the Nanjing Military Region, and Li Lun, deputy director of the 
General Logistics Department, both of whom were 67 years old. 
However, they were invited to be advisers to their original 
units, and their hidden influence should not be overlooked. At 
the same time, a number of military brass who had been promoted 
for suppressing the 1989 students' movement were demoted. This 
category included Commander Wang Cheng, Deputy Commander Zou 
Yuqi, and Political Commissar Zhang Gong -- all of the Beijing 
Military Region. They all were the major military brass who 
suppressed the 1989 students' movement. At that time, Wang 
Chengbin was the deputy commander of the Nanjing Military Region 
who led troops to Beijing to participate in the suppression, Zou 
Yuqi was the chief of staff of the troops that enforced martial 
law, Zhang Gong was director of the Beijing Military Region's 
Political Department and the man of the day in the "4 June" 
incident. Now one of them has retired, another has been 
transferred to the border areas, and the whereabouts of the 
third are unknown. In view of the fact that there is no end to 
the talk that "the Yangs" could stage a comeback after Deng, 
Jiang Zemin has spared no effort in completely uprooting the 
Yangs' influence. At the same time, he has removed from 
important posts all those people who were involved in the "4 
June" incident, an act that should contribute to easing people's 
grievances against the CPC. 
  The traditional view is that the aim of the CPC's 
transferring the military brass lies in reducing their 
influence, so as to make effective control over the military 
possible. Some people believe that this transfer of the 
military brass will bring about a situation in which "commanders 
are unfamiliar with the troops, and vice versa." However, 
ZHONGGUO JUSHI believes that a motive that has been neglected is 
the promotion of cooperation among the military regions and 
various service arms, so these transfers may be a means of 
"killing two birds with one stone." The military brass promoted 
during the current reshuffle included Li Laizhu, the newly 
appointed commander of the Beijing Military Region. The rest 
mostly were transferred from other military regions. There was a 
high frequency of exchanging commanders between military 
regions. For example, Lieutenant General Gu Hui, of the Nanjing 
Military Region, served in the Guangzhou Military Region for 
almost 40 years before his recent transfer. Both Liu Yuanan, 
former political commissar of the Nanjing Military Region, and 
Fang Zhuqi, the region's newly appointed political commissar, 
used to serve in the Guangzhou Military Region. Lieutenant 
General Qu Zhenmao, deputy commander of the Nanjing Military 
Region and concurrently commander of the Donghai Fleet, used to 
be deputy commander of the Nanhai Fleet under the Guangzhou 
Military Region. Lieutenant General Shi Yuxiao, political 
commissar of the Guangzhou Military Region, used to be political 
commissar of the Nanjing Military Region. 
  It should be noted that newly appointed Beijing Garrison 
Commander He Daoquan used to be commander of the the 23d Group 
Army stationed in Heilongjiang; he was the first officer in the 
field troops to set up an automation system and was trained at 
the PLA's National Defense University. The Beijing Garrison is 
in charge of defending the CPC central organizations. In 
principle, its commander should be nominated directly by the PLA 
chief of general staff; nevertheless, its commander has been 
changed three times since the "4 June" incident. 
  Another new phenomenon to be explored and studied in the 
recent transfer of military brass is that both Li Xinliang, the 
newly appointed political commissar of the Shenyang Military 
Region, and Zhang Zhijiang, political commissar of the Chengdu 
Military Region have no background in political work, but are 
professional soldiers. If this is no coincidence, it may mark 
the beginning of a trend of depoliticization of the Army.

<F P=106> [By Liu Xiangzheng (0491 7449 2398): "Armed Police Force </F>
Commander Ba Zhongtan Visits Armed Police Officers and Men in 
Qinghai and Ningxia to Express Appreciation"] 
  [Text] Since it will soon be Spring Festival, a delegation 
from the headquarters of the Chinese People's Armed Police 
Force, led by Commander Ba Zhongtan, went to Qinghai and Ningxia 
to extend greetings to armed police officers and men stationed 
there. 
  The delegation, led by Commander Ba as its chief and Deputy 
Commanders Wang Wenli and An Jiaoju as its deputy chiefs, began 
its visits to armed police forces stationed in Qinghai and 
Ningxia on 25 January. The members of the delegation, ignoring 
fatigue, trying to overcome altitude sickness, and braving 
piercing cold, made their way to offices and basic units to call 
on officers and men. They also went down to squads and platoons 
to inspect internal management, equipment, and warehouses and to 
ask soldiers about their work, study, and daily life in detail. 
The delegation fully affirmed the outstanding achievements made 
by the large numbers of officers and men in maintaining social 
stability, promoting the unity of various nationalities, and 
revitalizing the economy. The delegation also encouraged the 
officers and men to be ready to "stand at the front" in the 
fight to safeguard national security and maintain social 
stability, to conscientiously carry out the party's nationality 
and religious policies, to cherish every tree and every blade of 
grass in the places where they are stationed, to launch the 
drive to support the government and cherish the people, and to 
make new contributions to preserving public security and 
promoting economic development in Qinghai and Ningxia in the new 
year.

Yang (2457 2254): "Province, City Hold Rally To Extend Spring 
Festival Greetings to the Army and To Name Double-Support Model 
Cities (Counties)"] 
  [Text] Zhejiang and Hangzhou held a rally on 1 February at 
the Great Hall of the People in Hangzhou to support the military 
and comfort military dependents on the occasion of the Spring 
Festival, as well as to name double-support model cities 
(counties). 
  The meeting was attended by provincial and city party, 
government, and military leaders Li Zemin, Liu Feng, Chai 
Songyue, Lu Zhangong, Wang Qichao, Xu Yongqing, Liu Xirong, Li 
Jinming, Xu Xingguan, Xu Zhichun, Jue Duanlin, Wei Boliang, Wang 
Jingxi, Yang Shijie, Yan Eryi, Xu Tingsheng, and Li Jinliang, as 
well as 2,000 officers and men of the ground, naval, air, and 
armed police units stationed in Zhejiang. 
  Li Jinming, Standing Committee member of the provincial 
party 
committee and secretary of the Hangzhou party committee, 
officiated at the meeting. 
  Liu Xirong, Standing Committee member of the provincial 
party 
committee and vice governor, was the first to speak. On behalf 
of the provincial party committee, the provincial government, 
the provincial people's congress, the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference provincial committee, and the people of 
Zhejiang, he extended Spring Festival greetings to officers and 
men of all ground, naval, air, and armed police units stationed 
in Zhejiang; families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers; 
disabled soldiers; demobilized servicemen; and retired military 
cadres. He also extended warm congratulations to the seven 
cities and counties named as model counties (cities) in 
supporting the military and government and in giving 
preferential treatment to families of revolutionary martyrs and 
soldiers. 
  Liu said: Led by the party Central Committee with Comrade 
Jiang Zemin at the core, over the past year we have adhered to 
the party's basic line of "one center and two basic points," 
earnestly studied and practiced Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, persisted in 
reform and opening up, and accelerated the pace of establishing 
a socialist market economy, thereby achieving significant 
progress in socialist construction and bringing about a new 
climate in building a socialist spiritual civilization. These 
achievements are the results of concerted efforts and hard work 
by soldiers and civilians in Zhejiang. He added: Over the past 
year, officers and men of the ground, naval, air, and armed 
police units, sharing weal and woe with the people, have further 
rendered meritorious services for economic development and 
military building. Over the past year, families of 
revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, disabled soldiers, and 
demobilized servicemen, preserving and carrying forward glorious 
revolutionary traditions, have played an important role at 
various posts and on all fronts, and have performed new exploits 
in reform and construction; at the same time, the large number 
of retired military cadres have made new contributions to 
promoting social stability and economic growth, thereby winning 
the respect and praise of the people throughout Zhejiang. 
  Liu went on to say: The year 1994 will be very crucial for 
China's reform, opening up, and economic construction. We must 
unswervingly follow Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. In line with the 
requirements for establishing a socialist market economy, we 
must seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, 
promote development, and maintain stability so as to achieve 
faster growth in the provincial economy and raise the standard 
of living by a larger margin. In the coming year, we must 
inherit and carry forward the revolutionary traditions; further 
deepen the campaigns to support the government and cherish the 
people, and to support the army and give preferential treatment 
to military dependents; concern ourselves with military 
building; and further strengthen unity between the military and 
the government as well as between soldiers and civilians, 
thereby pushing the double-support work to new heights. 
  On behalf of all officers and men of the ground, naval, 
air, and armed police units, Xu Yongqing, political commissar of 
the provincial military district, extended warm congratulations 
to the counties and cities named as models in supporting the 
military and the government and in giving preferential treatment 
to military dependents; he also extended sincere gratitude to 
party committees and governments at all levels, as well as the 
people of Zhejiang, for their concern and support for the 
construction of military units and reserve forces over a long 
period of time. Xu said: In accordance with the requirements 
set by the party Central Committee and the Central Military 
Commission, all units stationed in Zhejiang, under the 
leadership of higher authorities and the support of the 
provincial party committee and provincial government, have 
successfully completed the tasks and duties of war preparedness 
and training, focusing on education and training, and aimed at 
raising their combat capability. In the coming year, we shall 
inherit and develop the glorious traditions of the party and the 
military, preserve the nature of the people's military, and 
promote social stability and military building. In the face of 
arduous tasks, all military units shall unfailingly adhere to 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's concept of military building in the new 
period, and in accordance with Chairman Jiang Zemin's demand -- 
that "all military units must be politically qualified and 
militarily capable, must have a good work style, must maintain 
strict discipline, and must be assured of adequate logistic 
support" -- shall strengthen military building in an all-round 
manner and resolutely complete all tasks assigned by higher 
authorities. Meanwhile, we shall stand fast with the 42 million 
people of Zhejiang in holding high the banner of reform and 
opening up, and in working with one heart and one mind to make 
even greater contributions to building two civilizations in 
Zhejiang. 
  Liu Feng, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee 
and head of the provincial leading group on double-support, read 
a "Decision on Naming the Third Group of Model Cities (Counties) 
in Double-Support" adopted by the provincial party committee, 
the provincial government, and the provincial military district. 
  Wang Zhuohui, deputy secretary of the Ningbo party committee 
and head of the city's leading group on double-support, spoke on 
behalf of the model counties and cities.

<F P=106> [By Wu Xianping (0124 0341 1627): "The `Epidemic Disease of </F>
Business Cards' Has Hit the Barracks"] 
  [Text] In recent years, a "business card fad" has quietly 
emerged in the Army barracks. Last year alone, this writer 
received 183 business cards from friends serving in the 
military. These cards belong to both cadres and soldiers, with 
168 people engaging in office work, accounting for 92 percent, 
and 15 others working in military-run enterprises, accounting 
for 8 percent. 
  These business cards are characterized by the abundant use 
of 
Army unit designations, titles, and sensitive internal Army 
telephone numbers. With these problems in mind, this writer has 
conducted investigations in several Army units. People have 
reported that the indiscriminate printing and distribution of 
business cards poses many disadvantages to army building: It 
endangers the management and security of the barracks areas. 
After taking the business cards offered them by servicemen, some 
job-seekers have visited various Army units "out of admiration." 
To find a suitable job, they go to this office today and that 
office tomorrow in an effort to establish a network of 
relationships. This has not only disrupted the normal work and 
order in the barracks areas but has also encouraged unhealthy 
practices. Some unscrupulous persons have even taken advantage 
of the opportunity to commit crimes in Army units. 
  It discredits the Army units' prestige. To build up their 
social status, some servicemen have indiscriminately added 
titles to their business cards, such as "director" of this 
factory, "manager" or "business section head" of that company, 
and "member" or "director" of a wide variety of societies and 
associations. As some are not worthy of these titles, the 
prestige of the Army units has suffered. 
  It is not conducive to confidential nature of the Army 
units' 
work. Some of the business cards carry the Army unit 
designation, detailed address, and internal telephone numbers. 
This has undoubtedly gravely damaged confidentiality. There 
has been no lack of lessons in this regard. According to an 
armed services newspaper report on 27 March 1993, an operational 
staff officer called He from an Army unit stationed in a special 
economic zone gave his cousin in Hong Kong a business card 
bearing the address and classified telephone number of his unit. 
The result is that the classified telephone is no longer 
classified. A certain clerical worker called Huang also brought 
losses to army building by indiscriminately distributing his 
business cards, which have been made use of by an enemy agent. 
  In short, the fashion of distributing business cards in Army 
units has more disadvantages than advantages for army building 
and should arouse the close attention of the department 
concerned. It is necessary to adopt effective measures to step 
up guidance and management, especially to strictly observe 
security discipline.

<F P=106> [From the "Regional News Hookup" program] </F>
  [Excerpt] The autonomous regional party committee held a 
meeting to disseminate the guidelines of the national conference 
on propaganda and ideological work on the morning of 5 February. 
Danzim, deputy secretary of the autonomous regional party 
committee, chaired the meeting. Chen Hanchang, member of the 
autonomous regional party committee standing committee and 
director of the propaganda department, relayed the principal 
guidelines of the conference. He said: We should firmly grasp 
the basic guiding principle of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, closely center 
around the central work of economic construction, subject 
ourselves to and serve the work of the entire party, 
comprehensively carry out the tasks on the propaganda and 
ideological front, and provide a favorable ideological guarantee 
and public opinion for stepping up the establishment of a 
socialist market economic system; promoting sustained, rapid, 
and healthy economic development; safeguarding political 
stability; and promoting overall social progress. 
  Chen Hanchang said: At the national conference on propaganda 
and ideological work, General Secretary Jiang Zemin further 
expounded the major tasks in propaganda and ideological work: 
The propaganda and ideological front must firmly grasp the 
basic guiding principle of the theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and emphatically do a good job in four 
aspects of work, namely, theory, public opinion, ideological 
education, and the main theme, which means arming the people 
with scientific theory, guiding them with correct public 
opinions, cultivating them with a lofty spirit, and inspiring 
them with excellent work. The one basic guiding principle and 
four aspects of work put forward by General Secretary Jiang 
Zemin serve, respectively, as the soul of the propaganda and 
ideological front that defines the direction of all work and as 
four major key projects that embody and carry out the basic 
guiding principle. Only by so doing can we better accomplish 
the important missions undertaken by departments in charge of 
propaganda and ideological work; correctly publicize the party's 
theories, line, principles, and policies; vividly reflect the 
great practices of the masses; and unite all the strength that 
we can muster to strive for attaining the magnificent goal of 
establishing socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  Chen Hanchang urged party committees at various levels in 
Tibet to fully understand the significant importance of the 
national conference on propaganda and ideological work; 
earnestly study the guidelines of important speeches delivered 
at the conference by General Secretary Jiang Zemin, Premier Li 
Peng, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, and Director [of the Propaganda 
Department under the CPC Central Committee] Ding Guangen; fully 
study, grasp, and implement these guidelines; and regard this as 
a turning point to boost Tibet's propaganda and ideological work 
to a new level. [video shows Chen Hanchang in a dark Mao suit 
and with a coat over his shoulders, reading from a prepared 
speech; video shows shots of those in attendance at the meeting 
while Chen is speaking] 
  Gyaincain Norbu, deputy secretary of the autonomous 
regional party committee and chairman of the autonomous regional 
government, emphasized four issues at the meeting. He noted: 
1) We should firmly adhere to the basic principles for the work 
of the entire party and consider the overall situation to 
completely accomplish the important missions undertaken by the 
departments in charge of propaganda and ideological work and 
make contributions to advancing the construction of material and 
spiritual civilization as well as social progress in Tibet. 2) 
We should gain a clear understanding of the international and 
domestic situations and seize the opportunity to step up the 
pace of reform and development in Tibet. To serve the cause of 
reform and development, we should continue to carry out 
propaganda and ideological work by being well aware of public 
opinion and maintaining the stability and continuity of the 
keynotes in propaganda. We should seek comprehensiveness, 
objectivity, and precision and avoid one-sidedness in 
propaganda. Taking the basic interests of the party and state as 
our main concern, we should consciously act in unison with the 
CPC Central Committee in terms of politics. Tibet's tasks in 
reform and development are more arduous this year. All 
departments in charge of propaganda and ideological work must 
keep emancipating their minds, seeking truth from facts, 
integrating their own characteristics, seriously summing up 
experiences, studying the law of propaganda, promoting their 
work with creativity, and vigorously seeking new ideas for 
propaganda and ideological work under the conditions of a 
socialist market economy. 3) We should regard the work of 
maintaining social stability as our duty and support reform with 
a clear-cut stand. This year is one of crucial importance to 
the progress of Tibet's reform and construction. Thus, we must 
fully assess the arduousness and complexity of reform. Whether 
we can score a victory in the work of deepening reform is a 
severe test of us. In this new year, comrades on the propaganda 
and ideological front should subject themselves to the overall 
situation, serve the central work, correctly guide public 
opinion, support reform with a clear-cut stand, precisely grasp 
and publicize the party's principles and policies, correctly 
address the overall economic situation in a timely manner, and 
scientifically and conscientiously publicize a series of reform 
programs, policies, and measures adopted at this year's regional 
work conference on the economy. They should regard social 
stability as their duty and address and resolve in a timely 
manner the ideological problems cropping up in the course of 
reform. They should carry out the media's supervisory role and 
help party committees and governments at various levels improve 
their work, properly handle public feelings, and thaw 
contradictions to create a favorable milieu and public opinion 
for deepening reform and smoothly establishing a new socialist 
market economic system in Tibet. 4) Party committees and 
governments at various levels must strengthen their leadership 
in propaganda and ideological work. Propaganda and ideological 
work plays an important part in the overall efforts for the 
cause of establishing socialism with Chinese characteristics; it 
is a political advantage of the CPC and an important magic 
weapon for ensuring the smooth progress of reform and 
construction. Party committees and governments at various 
levels must attach great importance to this work, strengthen 
their leadership in it, and really take responsibility for the 
work. Party committees at various levels should place the work 
of intensifying and improving propaganda and ideological work on 
the agenda and frequently give guidance and check on the work. 
Government departments at various levels should attach 
importance to and support propaganda and ideological work; 
create necessary conditions for cadres engaged in the work; 
actively help them resolve practical difficulties; and strive to 
solve the current problems of scarce personnel, poor quality, 
bad facilities, and dull work methods on the propaganda and 
ideological front so as to remarkably improve the conditions for 
propaganda and ideological work and bring about better results.

  [Text] A regional economic work conference continued in 
session on the morning of 16 January, presided over by Yang 
Chuantang, executive vice chairman of the autonomous region. 
  Those attending the conference were leaders of the 
autonomous 
region, including Gyaincain Norbu, Guo Jinlong, Banzim, Yang 
Chuantang, Lieque, Puqung, Sengqen Lozong Gyaincain, Pudoji, 
(Gong Daxi), Baima Duoji, (Jiang Cuo), Jipu Pingcuo Cideng, 
Cering Sangzhub, (Yang Song), (Ciren Cuoga), and Luosang 
Toinzhub, as well as heads of prefectures, counties, and 
districts, mayors of cities, and responsible persons of major 
economic departments and regional- level units. 
  At the conference, Gyaincain Norbu, deputy secretary of the 
regional party committee and chairman of the autonomous region, 
gave a report entitled: "Accelerate the Establishment of a 
Socialist Market Economic Structure and Promote Rapid 
Development of the National Economy." 
  Reviewing the region's 1993 achievements in economic work, 
Gyaincain Norbu said: Since the beginning of last year, we have 
scored marked achievements in establishing a socialist market 
economic structure, accelerating the development of the national 
economy, deepening reforms, and opening wider to the outside 
world under the guidance of the guidelines laid down by the 14th 
party congress and the fourth enlarged plenary session of the 
fourth regional party committee. It is estimated that the total 
annual output value of goods and services for the region in 1993 
was 3.65 billion yuan, an increase of 8.1 percent over 1992 in 
real terms. The annual output value of the primary industries 
totaled 1.77 billion yuan, up 4.9 percent; that of the secondary 
industries was 530 million yuan, up 16.6 percent; and that of 
the tertiary industries reached 1.35 billion yuan, up 9.5 
percent. The relatively rapid development of the economy has 
increased the economic strength of the region. It is estimated 
that the region's financial revenues in 1993 were 149 million 
yuan, increasing 37 percent over 1992. 
  The economy of the rural and pastoral areas has developed 
steadily. It is estimated that the region's total agricultural 
output value was 2.228 billion yuan in 1993, an increase of 5.3 
percent over the previous year. A bumper harvest was reaped for 
the sixth consecutive year, and total grain output reached 
620,000 tonnes, up 3.3 percent. Major production targets in 
animal husbandry were fulfilled, which were a little more than 
or remained the same as those of the previous year. Village and 
town enterprises and diversified economic undertakings have 
developed rather rapidly. It is estimated that the total output 
value of the village and town enterprises reached 100 million 
yuan, and the income of diversified economic undertakings 
totaled 240 million yuan, increasing 14.9 percent and 18.8 
percent respectively over the previous year. Per capita income 
for the peasants and herdsmen was 515 yuan, up 5.1 percent 
compared with the previous year. 
  The economic results of industrial and communications 
enterprises have increased noticeably. It is estimated that the 
region's total industrial output value reached 470 million yuan, 
up 7.8 percent over the previous year. The output of major 
products has increased, and the quality of products has 
improved. The marketing rate of products has reached 94.85 
percent. Thus, production, marketing, and economic results have 
increased simultaneously. 
  The number of enterprises suffering losses has decreased. A 
good momentum has been maintained in the development of foreign 
trade and tourism. It is estimated that the region's volume of 
foreign trade reached $100 million, up 55.4 percent over the 
previous year. Of this volume, exports were worth $20 million, 
and imports $80 million, increasing 3.6 percent and 77.6 percent 
respectively over the previous year. Efforts have been made to 
improve the management and operations of tourism, to open up new 
tourist routes and scenic spots, and to run special events, thus 
attracting tourists. In 1993, the region received 23,000 
foreign tourists and earned 100,000,600 yuan, increasing 15 
percent and 10 percent respectively over the previous year. It 
also earned more than 9 million yuan of foreign exchange in 
tourism, up 7.9 percent compared with the previous year. 
  New progress has been made in introducing investment from 
abroad and establishing lateral ties at home. More than 40 
projects were approved in these regards last year, with a total 
contracted investment of 67.1 million yuan and $9.63 million. 
In addition, the region also set up some enterprises with its 
own funds in coastal and other areas of the country. 
  Infrastructure construction, with the stress on energy, 
transportation, and communications projects, has gone well. It 
is estimated that the region invested 1.59 billion yuan in fixed 
assets in 1993, increasing 15 percent over the previous year. 
  The construction of the Bamda Airport runway was basically 
completed last year. The Sichuan-Xizang, Xinjiang-Xizang, 
China-Nepal, and (Zegong) highways were repaired or rebuilt on 
schedule, and the quality of construction was noticeably 
improved. The annual plans for construction of the Yanghu and 
Chalong Power Stations were overfulfilled with quality. The 
Gonggar Airport extension project has been completed and put 
into operation. 
  Communications construction progressed smoothly. A unified 
telephone system, including city and long-distance calls, was 
set up in the urban areas of six prefectures and cities; and 58 
satellite communication ground stations at the county level were 
built and installed with equipment, 35 of which were put into 
operation. Technical transformation projects were carried out 
rather effectively. 
  Urban and rural markets became increasingly brisk. It is 
estimated that the total volume of retail sales in the region 
was 1.9 billion yuan last year, up 13.1 percent over the 
previous year. The fast-rising market prices were brought under 
effective control. 
  Social undertakings developed rapidly. The region invested 
more than 180 million yuan in education last year, increasing 
13.3 percent over the previous year; 248 new schools of various 
types were set up; and 63.2 percent of the children of school 
age were in school, up 2.7 percent over the previous year. 
  Gyaincain Norbu said: We paid close attention to work 
particularly in the following aspects last year: 
  1. We proceeded from emancipating our minds to enhance our 
sense of the urgency of economic development. Last year, we 
made efforts to emancipate our minds and adopt new ideas as a 
prerequisite for deepening reforms, opening up wider to the 
outside world, and accelerating economic development. We held 
discussions on emancipating the mind and changing the mindset in 
various ways. We also organized groups of different sizes to be 
sent to the interior for study. Through study, visits, and 
observation, cadres and people were able to see the big gap 
between the region and other parts of the country in economic 
development, thus increasing their confidence and courage in 
developing productive forces. According to incomplete 
statistics, since Comrade Deng Xiaoping delivered his speeches 
during his tour of south China, 876 new state, collective, and 
private enterprises have been set up in the region, with a total 
registered capital of 766 million yuan. 
  2. We stepped up the reform of the economic structure with a 
view to establishing a socialist market economic structure. 
While reforming the economic structure with the stress on 
enterprise reform, we paid close attention to giving enterprises 
decision-making power in management and improving external 
conditions for their production and operation. The building of 
a market system was accelerated, and market facilities were 
improved day by day. The fundamental role of the market in the 
allocation of resources was initially brought into play. The 
circulation of capital and consumer goods became increasingly 
smooth, presenting a picture of prosperity. 
  3. We promoted a healthy development of the economy by 
improving and strengthening macroeconomic regulation and 
control. In accordance with the guidelines set forth in the 
central authorities' No. 6 Document, we took a series of 
measures to improve and strengthen macroeconomic regulation and 
control, with a view to coping with problems in reform and 
economic development. We made remarkable achievements in this 
regard. 
  4. We carried out the anticorruption struggle to improve the 
general mood of society. 
  Gyaincain Norbu said: In our region today, the economy is 
further developing, the political situation is stable, and the 
unity of nationalities is further strengthened. New progress 
has been made in various social undertakings. The overall 
situation is good. 
  On the guiding principles for this year's economic work in 
Tibet, Gyaincain Norbu said: The guiding principles for this 
year's economic work across the region are to: implement in an 
all-round way the guidelines laid down by the third plenary 
session of the party's 14th central committee and the fifth 
enlarged plenary session of the fourth regional party committee; 
accelerate the pace of reform with a view to establishing a 
socialist market economic structure; open up wider to the 
outside world; continue to improve macroeconomic regulation and 
control; step up infrastructure construction; vigorously 
readjust the economic structure [da li tiao zheng jing ji jie 
gou]; continuously improve economic results; and strive to 
promote a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the 
region's economy. 
  In arranging this year's economic work, Gyaincain Norbu 
particularly stressed: We should deepen reforms according to 
the national plan in this regard. On the principles of being 
positive and steady, proceeding in an orderly way and step by 
step, and making appropriate adaptions in the light of different 
conditions, we should carry out reforms in an all-round way and 
make sure that our systems are compatible with those in other 
parts of the country. We should seize the opportunity to 
accelerate economic development. At the same time, we should 
maintain social stability and create a favorable environment for 
reform, opening up, and economic development. We should 
concentrate our financial resources on infrastructure 
construction. 
  On ensuring the smooth progress of reform and development, 
Gyaincain Norbu pointed out: Development is the foundation of 
social stability, and reform gives development a tremendous 
stimulus. Only by maintaining social stability will it be 
possible to smoothly carry out reforms, open to the outside 
world, and make economic development. Therefore, we should 
correctly understand and handle the relationship between reform, 
development, and stability. Under no circumstances should we 
maintain stability in a negative way without carrying out 
reforms. Meanwhile, we should take measures to prevent 
troubles, especially serious ones, from occurring. The tasks of 
reform and development for this year are very arduous. To 
accelerate the establishment of a socialist market economic 
structure, we should carry out reforms faster, more extensively, 
and more in depth. Generally speaking, we are really in a 
favorable period for reform and development. However, there are 
also some problems which cannot be ignored. Reform is bound to 
touch or break old systems, old economic relations, and old 
patterns of interests and to give rise to new contradictions and 
problems. In Tibet, which is conditioned by many factors and 
where various contradictions are intertwined, carrying out 
reforms is not only very difficult but involves certain risks as 
well. Party committees and governments at various levels should 
have a clear understanding of this situation. They should fully 
assess problems and make all possible preparations against the 
occurring of serious problems so that they will not hesitate 
about what move to take and that the progress of reform and 
development will be affected. 
  On further ensuring the smooth progress of reform and 
development, Gyaincain Norbu stressed: We should always adhere 
to the principle of grasping two links at the same time, 
effectively perform mass work, extensively carry out the 
anticorruption struggle, and further strengthen our leadership. 
  In concluding, Chairman Gyaincain Norbu called on cadres and 
people throughout the region to guide themselves with the 
guidelines laid down by the third plenary session of the party's 
14th central committee and the fifth enlarged plenary session of 
the fourth regional party committee, to work hard in unity, and 
to strive to bring about a new situation in the region's economy.

Conscientiously With One Heart and One Mind To Push Economic 
Reform and Development to a New Height -- Regional Economic Work 
Conference Ends Triumphantly"] 
  [Text] A five-day regional economic work conference ended 
triumphantly at the Lhasa People's Hall on the afternoon of 19 
January. Yang Chuantang, Standing Committee member of the 
regional party committee and executive vice chairman of the 
regional government, made a closing speech. He urged cadres 
across Tibet to, in line with the tasks and objective set by the 
Fifth Enlarged Plenary Session of the Fourth Regional Party 
Committee and by the current conference, work conscientiously 
with one heart and one mind to push the regional economic 
structural reform and development to a new height. 
  Gyamco, executive vice chairman of the regional government, 
chaired the conference. 
  Attending the conference's closing were regional leaders 
Gyaincain Norbu, Guo Jinlong, Buqiong, Puqung, Sengqen Lozong 
Gyaincain, Pudoje, Gong Daxi, Baima Duoji, Gying Puncog Cedain, 
Zeren Sangzhu, Yang Song, Ciren Zhuoga, Luosang Dunzhu, Jimzhong 
Gyaincain Puncog, Cedain Zhoima, and Zhou Qishun; as well as 
Yang Youcai, chief procurator of the regional people's 
procuratorate. 
  The conference transmitted and studied the guidelines of the 
national economic work conference and conferences of special 
trades convened by the relevant state departments, analyzed the 
current economic situation, mapped out arrangements for the 
regional economic structural reform and economic work in this 
year, and discussed and revised a number of major reform 
measures. During the conference, its participants held animated 
discussions on the conference documents, focused on the theme of 
reform, development, and stability; and offered many 
constructive suggestions and opinions. 
  Comrade Yang Chuantang said: Through study and discussion 
over the past few days, conferees have deepened their 
understanding of the necessity of accelerating the establishment 
of a socialist market economic structure, increased their sense 
of responsibility and urgency toward expediting reforms and 
promoting economic growth, clarified the guiding principles and 
tasks of this year's economic work and the basic ideology for 
reform, and strengthened their confidence in successfully 
carrying out the tasks. They agree that the conference, which 
has witnessed in-depth study of issues centering around a 
clear-cut theme, reveals a new outlook of reform and opening up, 
a new momentum of hard work, and a prevailing mood of 
concentrating all resources on economic construction. 
  Discussing the conference guidelines, Yang Chuantang pointed 
out: It is necessary to, first, study; second, transmit; and 
third, organize the implementation of the guidelines effectively. 
  Comrade Yang Chuantang said: The theory and practice of 
China's socialist construction and development have testified 
that reform is the propelling force for economic expansion and 
the only way for liberating productive forces and opening up a 
new situation in the work of all fields. The rapid growth of 
the regional economy over the past more than a decade has been 
achieved mainly through reform. To continue our advance and 
effect a new leap in the future, we should continue reforms. At 
present, we are facing an excellent opportunity of accelerating 
the development as well as the pace of reform. This is because, 
first of all, through the 15-year practice of reform, we have 
accumulated rich experiences and promoted reform from single to 
comprehensive projects. Second, Deng Xiaoping's talks during 
his southern tour and the 14th CPC National Congress have 
determined the establishment of a socialist market economic 
structure as the objective of reform. Third, the nation and the 
region have increased their overall economic strength and laid 
more solid material foundations. Fourth, the broad masses of 
people have greater tolerance and sense of urgency for reform, 
while party committees and governments at all levels are more 
capable of grasping the tasks of reform. Fifth -- and most 
important of all -- we have the theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics as our guide and the strong and 
effective leadership of the party Central Committee. We must 
not miss the opportunity. Therefore, to strengthen the intensity 
of reform and quicken the pace of reform is an inevitable trend 
of history. He said: As far as the question of reform is 
concerned, whoever takes a firm grip and makes an early start 
will achieve faster growth; and whoever makes a slow start will 
lag behind and be placed in a passive situation. Without making 
reform, or making slow-paced reform, we will retreat. In a 
sense, the rate of economic growth depends on the range and 
intensity of reform. 
  Yang Chuantang called on leaders at all levels to raise 
their understanding of the importance and urgency of reform, 
guide the overall situation through reforms, work relentlessly 
and innovatively in carrying out this year's reform measures, 
and promote economic development through reforms, thereby 
opening up a new situation in all fields of endeavor in Tibet. 
As far as this question is concerned, it is necessary to 
achieve unity in not only thinking and understanding, but also 
in action. Meanwhile, leaders at all levels should step up 
study and practice, constantly studying new circumstances and 
solving new problems. They should, in the light of the 
realities of reform, opening up, and the modernization drive, 
diligently study the basic tenents of Marxism and the important 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; the 
party Central Committee's line, principles, and policies; 
knowledge of the market economy and modern management and 
science; and knowledge in general so they can become experts in 
developing a socialist market economy. In the course of study, 
they should be bold in exploration and practice. As reform is a 
penetrating and complex evolution, temporary differences in 
thinking and understanding are only natural. However, once a 
reform measure is adopted, it is necessary to organize its 
implementation. When in doubt on an issue, it is necessary to 
apply the criterion of "conducive to three causes," avoid 
squabbling, explore further, and be bold in practice so as to 
unify understanding and emancipate the mind through the practice 
of reform. Moreover, it is also necessary to discover and use 
advanced models as pacesetters, as well as to identity and help 
typical cases of lagging behind in reform, thereby promoting 
reform as a whole through grasping both ends to bring along the 
intermediate zone. 
  Yang Chuantang emphasized: The key to achieving, or more 
effectively achieving our established goal, lies in concrete 
action. Upon returning to their work units, conferees should 
translate the conference guidelines into concrete action in 
every aspect of work and ensure effective implementation of each 
and every policy measure. They should vie with each other in 
striving to achieve fruitful results in the course of 
implementation. It is necessary to strictly enforce a 
responsibility system, and clearly define tasks and 
requirements, as well as reward and penalty. While implementing 
various tasks, it is imperative to improve the style of work, 
and encourage the pragmatic spirit of more solid work and less 
empty talk. To this end, leading cadres at all levels should 
guard against and overcome piles of documents and countless 
meetings, the formalism of issuing general calls while lacking 
concrete guidance, and the bureaucratism of divorcing from 
realities and failing to go down to the grass roots to do 
concrete work. They should periodically go down to the 
frontline of reform and development to conduct investigation and 
study, to give guidance in work, and to discover and solve 
problems in good time, thereby facilitating the smooth progress 
of reforms. Meanwhile, in carrying out a new reform measure, it 
is necessary to stress scientific approach; under no 
circumstance should we do things on the spur of the moment or 
according to subjective wishes. We should conduct scientific 
verification based on investigation and study to ensure each and 
every policy measure and specific project can yield the optimal 
economic and social benefits. In improving the workstyle, it is 
also necessary to attach importance to and strengthen the mass 
work. We should foster a firm awareness of the masses; and 
periodically go down to the grass roots to mingle with the 
masses, to do thorough and meticulous mass work and propaganda 
and guidance work, to listen to the opinions of the people, and 
to grasp the pulse of the man in the street. We should conduct 
in-depth investigation and promptly solve problems reported by 
the masses in general. Meanwhile, we should care about the 
livelihood of the people, paying particular attention to those 
who still do not have enough to eat and wear, to workers of 
enterprises in production stoppage or semi-stoppage, and to 
retirees. We should show the concern of the party and 
government for them by helping them solve practical problems, 
thereby forging closer ties between the party and government and 
the masses, safeguarding and bringing into better play their 
enthusiasm, and working concertedly to more successfully carry 
out the three major tasks of reform, development, and stability. 
  In conclusion, Yang Chuantang said: The whole year's work 
depends on a good beginning in the spring. While transmitting 
and implementing the conference guidelines, all localities 
should pay close attention to economic work, spring farming 
preparations in particular. They should step up efforts to 
organize the allocation and transportation of chemical 
fertilizers, pesticides, seeds, and other agricultural 
production means, ensuring their prompt delivery for spring 
farming. Industry, communications, commerce, and capital 
construction departments should also conscientiously implement 
the tasks set by the current conference and the regional 
planning conference, striving to get off to a good start and lay 
a sound foundation for comprehensive fulfillment of the various 
tasks for this year. Public security and judicial organs, mass 
organizations, and civil affairs departments should also make 
their share of contributions to creating a favorable social and 
external environment for reform, opening up, and economic 
construction. He said: This year will be a crucial year for 
promoting overall reform and achieving a breakthrough in key 
areas. Cadres throughout the region should, in accordance with 
the tasks and goal set by the Fifth Enlarged Plenary Session of 
the Fourth Regional Party Committee and the current conference, 
work conscientiously with one heart and one mind; and channel 
the enormous enthusiasm of the broad masses to reform in 
promoting the expansion of productive forces and accelerating 
economic construction in Tibet so as to greet the 30th 
anniversary of the establishment of the autonomous region with 
outstanding achievements in building material and spiritual 
civilizations.

Autonomous Region People's Government: "Sum Up the Economic 
Work Accomplished in 1993 and Expedite Reform and Economic 
Development"; date not given -- recorded; from the "News" 
program] 
  [Text] The year 1993 was an important year in which Tibet 
accelerated the pace of its economic development through 
earnestly implementing the instructions Comrade Xiaoping made in 
his important talk in southern China and the guidelines laid 
down by the 14th national party congress. In 1993, people 
throughout Tibet, under the regional party committee's correct 
leadership and guided by the goal of building a new socialist 
market economic system, made every effort to carry out reform 
and promote development. We focused on attention on the 
following five projects: 
  1. We strove to emancipate our minds and heighten our sense 
of urgency to develop the economy. Following the Fourth 
Enlarged Plenary Session of the Fourth Tibet Regional Party 
Committee, we launched all kinds of sizable discussions 
throughout Tibet about the need to emancipate our minds and 
change our mindset. We also sent groups of different sizes to 
other parts of the country to study their experiences. As a 
result of studying the instructions and guidelines as well as 
the discussions and visits, our cadres and masses have explored 
new ways of thinking, broaden their visions, and realized the 
big gap between our economic development and that in other parts 
of the country. Our awareness of the need to speed up reform, 
opening up, and economic development has heightened noticeably. 
At the same time, we have discovered Tibet's potential and 
strengths for economic development. Consequently our confidence 
and courage of developing our productive forces and revitalizing 
Tibet's economy heightened noticeably, and our enthusiasm of 
making plans for launching development projects, building 
markets, and setting up businesses soared with each passing day. 
An environment highly favorable for economic construction began 
to take shape in Tibet. 
  2. Guided by the goal of building a socialist market 
economic 
system, we made constant efforts to intensify reform. First, we 
firmly gave our enterprises their operating autonomy and strove 
to improve the environment for their production and operations 
by fully implementing the State Council's Regulations for 
Changing the Operating Mechanisms of State-Owned Industrial 
Enterprises and the regional government's procedures for 
implementing those regulations. Second, we restructured the 
systems governing planning, registration of enterprises, and 
setting prices. That was a major step we took on our way to 
establish a socialist market economic system. Third, we adopted 
various ways to establish and improve our market system. Through 
borrowing money from banks, raising capital ourselves, and 
forming partnership, all our prefectures and cities established 
many markets for trading agricultural products, livestocks, and 
industrial goods. This has enlivened the economy and provided 
the needed services for city and rural dwellers to improve their 
livelihood. Fourth, we drew up the necessary policies needed to 
encourage and support the development of independent and private 
business. 
  3. We broadened the scope for opening wider to the outside 
world as well as all channels for bringing in resources from 
other parts of the country and establishing ties with the 
outside world. First of all, we put an end to the situation 
where foreign trade enterprises could monopolize the business, 
encouraged and supported all types of enterprises to take part 
in ocean-going trade [yuan yang mao yi] and border trade. By 
launching these programs, our enterprises have diversified their 
business, and more people have come to know how to conduct 
foreign trade. Secondly, we set our minds in motion, broadened 
our vision, and broadly promoted Tibet's economic partnerships 
with other provinces and foreign countries. Taking advantage of 
the various channels, all prefectures, cities, and enterprises 
in Tibet succeeded in bringing in resources from the outside 
world and establishing partnership projects with counterparts 
elsewhere in the country. In 1993, Tibet officially approved 
more than 40 projects of bringing in outside resources and 
establishing partnerships with other parts of the country. 
These projects amounted to negotiated investments of 67.11 
million yuan and $9.63 million. Third, by encouraging 
enterprises to invest in other parts of the country, we merged 
Tibet's rich resources with the markets and technological 
strengths in other parts of the country. A pattern for Tibet to 
open itself to all directions began to take shape. 
  4. Tibet succeeded in building its infrastructure -- 
especially those projects relevant to the development of energy 
resources and communications and telecommunications services. 
In 1993, the region invested 1.59 billion yuan in fixed assets, 
topping that of the preceding year by 15 percent. Compared with 
those projects accomplished in the past, the quality and 
progress of all priority projects were better and faster. 
  5. We ensured a healthy economic development by 
intensifying and improving macroscopic regulation and control. 
Last year, basing on the guidelines in the No. 6 Document 
issued by the Central Committee and in view of Tibet's reform 
and development problems, we adoped a series of effective 
measures to intensify and improve Tibet's macroscopic regulation 
and control. First of all, to put banking affairs in order, we 
corrected various lawless interbanking lending businesses and 
unruly money raising conduct. By the end of last year, banking 
departments in Tibet had recovered more than 200 million yuan of 
day-to-day loans, or more than 60 percent of the extended loans; 
and rejected more than 2.5 million yuan previously approved to 
be extended to borrowers as their collectively raised funds. 
Second, we banned all unwarranted levies and fines, and 
abolished more than 80 of the 1,320 paid services that had been 
screened. By doing this we have lessened the burdens of 
enterprises and the masses. Third, we launched a widespread 
taxation, fiscal, and price inspection and discovered illegal 
transactions involving 17.8 million yuan. Of this amount, over 
2.6 million yuan has already been delivered to the treasury. 
Because of these measures, we have effectively stopped the 
massive outflow of capital, ensured the needs of priority 
projects, tightened financial and economic discipline, protected 
the interests of enterprises and people in cities and 
countryside, and brought about a healthy national economic 
development. 
  The successes achieved in launching these five projects have 
powerfully expedited Tibet's economic construction. It is 
estimated that Tibet's GNP will reach 3.65 billion yuan in 1993, 
or 8.1 percent higher than that of the preceding year when 
calculated in terms of comparable items. In 1993, Tibet's total 
agricultural output reached 2.228 billion yuan, or 5.3 percent 
higher than that of the preceding year; its total industrial 
output reached 470 million yuan, topping that of the preceding 
year by 7.8 percent; the region's revenues reached 149 million 
yuan, topping that of the preceding year by 37 percent; and the 
average per capita income of peasants and herdsmen reached 515 
yuan, an increase of 5.1 percent over that of a year before. 
This shows that Tibet's economic development as a whole has 
been fast and healthy. 
  The year 1994 is a year crucial for accelerating the pace of 
building a socialist market economic system. It also is an 
important year in which Tibet will greet its 30th founding 
anniversary with outstanding successes of national economic 
development. To achieve a breakthrough in reforming Tibet's 
economic system and even better results in developing Tibet's 
social productive forces during the New Year, the regional 
people's government recently called a regional economic 
conference to study the guidelines, general policy, and specific 
programs for reforming Tibet's economic system -- which will be 
promulgated one after another for implementation after they have 
been revised. On the basis of analyzing Tibet's economic 
development in 1993, the conference also studied and came up 
with certain major economic development projects for 1994. 
These projects include: Focusing on increasing the incomes of 
peasants and herdsmen, Tibet will energetically develop the 
economy in its agricultural and pastoral areas, strive to 
explore new areas for economic development, and do what is 
essential for expanding Tibet's capacity for future economic 
development. To ensure a smooth reform and economic 
development, we will continue to stabilize Tibet's political and 
social situation, promote administrative ethics, provide 
stronger leadership, improve our style of work, and do a good 
job in educating the masses. As long as people of all 
nationalities in Tibet understand the need of reform, support 
reform, throw themselves in reform, and concentrate their 
efforts on studying how to develop Tibet's economy -- as they 
have always been doing -- we certainly can make even greater 
strides in building a socialist market economic system during 
the New Year, and we certainly will be able to bring about 
significant changes when Tibet marks its 30th founding 
anniversary.

  [Text] Lhasa, February 17 (XINHUA) -- To pray for good 
harvests, Tibetans traditionally fly religious flags in five 
colors over the roofs of their houses during the Tibetan Spring 
Festival, which starts on February 11. 
  The blue stands for the sky, the white for clouds, red for 
fire, green for water and yellow for the earth. 
  In recent years, however, locals have also raised the 
country's five-star national flag together with Buddhist flags. 
  Under a bright sun and backed by white walls, the national 
flag flutters in the wind at the gate and the colorful banners 
fly on the rooftops. 
  Jodgu, a local guide to visitors, explained that hoisting 
religious banners shows the Tibetans' centuries of devotion to 
God while hoisting the national flag manifests their pride in 
China, their strong country. 
  Purpu Zhaxi, from Xe village in the Lhasa suburbs, agreed 
with Jodgu, saying that flying the flag is a token of 
gratefulness to the government for the big changes in his family. 
  "By 1985, hardly a household in our village of more than 60 
households had one TV set or could eat delicious meals," he 
said, while a light tune to greet guests streamed from his 
stereo system. 
  Atop the stereo cabinet were a butter lamp, qingke barley 
liquor, oranges, apples, preserved fruits and other delicacies 
beneath an image of Buddha. 
  "Now, however, most of the households have built new houses 
and bought color TV sets. 
  "These were all brought about by the good policies of the 
Chinese Government. With a comfortable life, don't you think we 
should remember the government when we are enjoying ourselves 
and welcoming the advent of a new year?"

<F P=106> [Article by Kao Yuan (7559 0626): "A Group of Tibetan Nuns </F>
Denounce Communist China's Repressive Rule"] 
  [Text] People of the Tibetan Kangpa tribe are reputed to 
be either devout Buddhists or lawless people. The Buddhist nuns 
did not know to which category their Kangpa guide belonged when 
they tried to escape Tibet. The guide had ferocious features 
and carried a dagger inside his fur overcoat. He planned to 
lead the nuns on a dangerous winter journey to Nepal across the 
Himalayas. For his services, he took most of the money the nuns 
were carrying. 
  Before they set off, the guide took 800 yuan from one of the 
nuns, an amount equal to three months' worth of the average 
Tibetan's income. The guide also told them that if they were 
caught by Chinese soldiers, they must not reveal his function as 
a guide, otherwise he would lose his life. 
  The long journey across a world of ice and snow exhausted 
the 
nuns. They carried only some dried meat and barley as food, and 
wore only sneakers on their feet. Every one of them wore only a 
few loose blouses, one coat, and one blanket. It normally takes 
25 days to travel to Nepal, but the guide knew that the weather 
in December often turned bad and that if they met with 
snowstorms, the nuns certainly would be killed by the cold. 
  One nun said that on the journey, the guide continuously 
urged them to move faster. If there were Chinese guards, they 
could not even use a torch when moving at night. They passed 
somewhere very near Chinese guards' checkpoints, so if anyone 
had so much as coughed, they would have been arrested. They did 
not make a fire, and just slept on sand, rocks, and snow. They 
walked along some meandering trails, and passed narrow and 
dazzling plank trails built along the cliff faces when they 
approached Mount Everest. Anyone who fell from the plank trails 
certainly would have their bodies smashed to pieces. They 
braved the strong winds and moved ahead, but they consumed all 
the food on the 17th day and found it extremely difficult to 
continue the journey! On seeing the green hills of Nepal, the 
nuns hugged each other with untold joy. 
  Their happiness was transient, however, because they met 
Nepalese police who asked for bribes and said that the nuns 
would be repatriated to Tibet if they did not pay up. The nuns 
did pay, but they were still arrested and jailed for a number of 
days in Kathmandu. After that, their rescuers took them to 
India's Damoshara, where the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual and 
political leader, lives in exile. 
  Two motives made the nuns face the hard journey across the 
Himalayas so bravely. First, they wished to pursue their 
religious belief under the leadership of the Dalai Lama. Many 
Tibetan people believe the Dalai Lama is the incarnation of the 
Buhhda. The nuns also wanted to tell human rights organizations 
about their sufferings in a Chinese prison, where they were 
tortured, beaten, and humiliated. Their testimony will expose 
the hypocrisy of the Beijing authorities' propaganda about the 
improvement of human rights conditions in Tibet. The Clinton 
administration was threatening to rescind China's 
most-favored-nation status unless Beijing stopped persecuting 
dissidents and respected Tibet's religion and culture. The 
story told by the nuns made people doubt China's willingness to 
relax its high-handed rule in Tibet. A number of Tibetans were 
put into prison for openly criticizing China's restraints on 
Tibetan culture. One of them protested for only for 90 seconds, 
shouting: "Long live the Dalai Lama" and "Freedom for Tibet." 
He then was taken away by the secret police. 
  For their protests, the nuns were jailed three years. In 
prison, they were beaten and were assaulted with electric batons 
on their tongues, breasts, and legs. 
  One nun said she was told that the Chinese Government had 
arrested a nun and cut her breasts off. She decided to do 
something because when she was only 15 years old she was 
arrested. She was also beaten when being interrogated under 
torture. 
  Another form of torture experienced by another nun was 
called 
"flying a plane." She was tied up by the thumbs, hung from the 
ceiling, and beaten. She also was assaulted with a cattle prod. 
She said that the policemen demanded that she put out her 
tongue; they then used a cattle prod on it. The attack made her 
lose consciousness. After she fell, they took her up and 
repeated the torture. 
  All the nuns were held in the prison most well-known to 
Tibetan people, which is located not far from Lhasa. In prison, 
they met a woman who had been jailed for participating in the 
1989 demonstrations for Tibet independence. There, the woman 
showed them how Chinese prison guards had used scissors to cut 
off her breasts. One of the woman's toes was cut almost off and 
was dangling on her foot. 
  After the nuns were released, they were not allowed to 
return 
to the monastery. Nuns and monks have always been the vanguard 
in opposing Chinese rule in Tibet, and they began their 
resistance as soon as Chinese troops had entered Tibet in 1950. 
Human rights organizations have said that 70 percent of 
prisoners in Tibet were Buddhist monks and nuns.

  [Text] Beijing, February 17 (XINHUA) -- Foreigners living 
in Beijing are enjoying more opportunities to get insights into 
Chinese people's lives while China is opening wider to the 
outside world. 
  Nicole Theisen, whose husband works at a German company's 
liaison office in Beijing, is fond of sitting in an 
old-fashioned tea house beside the Temple of Heaven in south 
Beijing, chatting with ordinary people and enjoying local songs. 
  "I hope that Beijing will have more places like this, where 
foreigners can talk freely with Chinese people," she said, 
noting that her hotel is pleasant enough as long as it does not 
turn into a cage. 
  However, many foreigners have found their own ways to get 
close to local people. Harald W. Villages, chief representative 
of the Walter Bau ag Company of Germany in Beijing, often 
strolls in the streets at weekends and has random chats with 
passers-by. 
  "Beijing people are willing to talk about the issues of 
their 
lives, such as prices and incomes," he said, "and they are also 
eager to learn about our lives." 
  While China opens wider and wider to the outside world, the 
number of foreigners living in Beijing is increasing. Most of 
them are diplomats, business persons, students, journalists and 
experts employed by Chinese units. The total number of foreign 
residents in the city is estimated at over 10,000, but there is 
no exact official figure. 
  Local companies and authorities provide chances for 
foreigners to mix with Chinese people. The Beijing Foreign 
Enterprises Services Company, a commercial company providing 
personnel and administrative services for foreign companies, 
frequently introduces foreigners to villages in the suburbs of 
the city, where they may go into any house to visit farmers. 
Many people bring their children to the farmers' houses, where 
the kids see goats, roosters and oxen for the first time. 
  But many people prefer to seek fun in the city. Joshua 
Ureneck from the United States said that young people tend to go 
to bars and discos which open late into the night. 
  Alex Vander Pol, a student from the U.S., said that the 
entertainment in Beijing is catching up with that in the coastal 
city of Shanghai in east China. 
  "But there are still not many places to go in the city," 
said 
Joshua who works with "CHINA PICTORIAL". He added that some 
hotels and parks charge foreigners higher prices than local 
people. And in some universities, tennis courts are separated 
for Chinese and foreign students, respectively. 
  "I don't want to be called a foreigner; I want to merge with 
Chinese people," Joshua said, adding that he hoped these 
ridiculous things left over from a closed China will disappear 
soon. 
  Joshua has made his own efforts to break down the barriers 
by 
setting up the Beijing Foreign Basketball League last August. 
The basketball league is exclusive. All its six teams are 
composed of students and businessmen from abroad. They play 
each other every week and form an "all-star" team to play 
Chinese amateurs from other parts of the country. 
  He said that both foreign and Chinese people are 
enthusiastic 
about the game. He explained that foreign people in Beijing may 
be sucked into limited circles at hotels and never get a chance 
to become involved with Chinese people. "But on a basketball 
court, you are as close to each other as you can get," he said.

<F P=106> [Speech by Cheng Weigao, secretary of the provincial party </F>
committee, at the Seventh Plenary Session of the Fourth 
Provincial Party Committee on 23 December 1993; place not given] 
  [Text] 1. The provincial economic and political situation 
is fairly good this year. Now, we are actually confronted with 
a favorable opportunity of reform, opening up, quickening of 
development. 
  The economic construction continuously develops at a faster 
speed on the basis of the fast development in 1992. The 
production and investment growth rates in 1993 surpass the 
growth rates in the Seventh Five-Year Plan period and the first 
two years of the Eighth Five-Year Plan period. New headway has 
been made in the enterprise reform dominated by the 
establishment of the socialist market economic system and some 
other auxiliary reforms. This year, the province has made the 
biggest strides for opening itself to both domestic areas and 
foreign countries. The province registers big increases in the 
number of newly signed, newly started, and newly completed 
projects relating to the three types of foreign-funded 
enterprises as well as in the amounts of foreign exchange 
earnings through exports by the three types of foreign-funded 
enterprises. The province's situation characterized by political 
and social stability has been consolidated and developed. 
Prominent contradictions, problems, and difficulties are as 
follows: When compared with the secondary industry which is 
under rapid development, the primary and tertiary industries are 
developing at a relatively slower rate. The readjustment of the 
product mix of the trades with competitiveness fails to keep 
abreast of the development of the market economy in the course 
of developing the industrial economy. The pace of opening to 
the outside world is not fast enough. The security situation is 
still grim. The thinking and work style of the cadres 
contingents cannot suit the setup of the grass-roots 
organizations. These problems should conscientiously be solved 
in the course of reform and development. 
  The next seven years is a key period for realizing the 
province's second-step development target. According to the 
guidelines of the 14th party congress, the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th Party Central Committee, and the Fifth Plenary 
Session of the Fourth Provincial Party Committee as well as the 
requirements as set forth in the "Hebei Economic Rejuvenation 
Program," the province set forth three specific targets for 
reform and development by the end of this century: First, the 
province should ensure a 500-percent increase in its GNP and 
strive to register a 700-percent increase, and ensure that the 
people will become fairly well-off. Second, the province should 
raise its ranking in the whole country in terms of the main 
national economic targets and stand among the rank of 
economically powerful provinces. Third, a new socialist market 
economic system should take preliminary shape. Viewing the 
practice in the first three years of the 1990's, we know that 
the province will not only be able to completely register a 
500-percent increase in the GNP but also have prospects for 
making a 700-percent increase so long as in the next seven 
years, the increases in the GNP and the input to fixed assets 
are continuously maintained at 1993's levels. 
  To win a tough battle in reform and development in the next 
seven years, we should double our efforts and conscientiously 
achieve 1994 work. The year 1994 is a key year for our country 
to promote the package economic reform and make breakthroughs in 
key areas as well as a decisive year for our province to 
implement the "program for rejuvenating the economy" and 
realizing the second doubling target. 
  The provincial party committee's general requirements for 
the 
1994 work are: Resolutely implement the guidelines of the third 
plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee and the 
national economic work conference; work closely in line with the 
main subjects of intensifying reform, expanding the scale of 
opening up, quickening development, and building Hebei into an 
economically powerful province; emancipate the mind; seek truth 
from facts; work hard; and create new special features, make new 
strides, and create new levels for the building of the two 
civilizations. The key to realizing these requirements is to 
further emancipate the mind, renew our ideas, and carry forward 
the spirit of having the dare to think and do pioneering work. 
We must not miss the favorable opportunities by hesitating or 
by adopting a wait-and-see attitude, slow down our development 
by grumbling and fearing difficulties, widen our differences by 
making vertical comparison and being self-satisfied, or 
obliterate our pioneering spirit with internal conflict. In 
grasping the emancipation of minds at present, we should not 
hold general and abstract discussions and should excel at 
seizing practical problems that are affecting reform and 
development. Through the upgrading of theoretical levels and 
the renewal of concepts, we should enable the emancipation of 
minds to be truly implemented in a down-to-earth manner and 
regard fast or slow progress in dealing with these problems as a 
yardstick in measuring the extent of emancipating minds. 
  2. We should earnestly implement central arrangements, 
reinforce the strength of reforms, accelerate the pace of 
reforms, and quicken the establishment of socialist market 
economic systems. 
  In line with implementing the decision on several questions 
of establishing the socialist market economy systems, which was 
adopted at the third plenary session, and according to the task 
of accelerating the establishment of socialist market economic 
systems, the central authorities will issue a series of 
important measures for reforms. Conducting reforms in line 
with these measures will exert important influence on promoting 
the organic integration between the socialist basic system and 
the market economy, on promoting enterprises to advance toward 
markets and to join in market competitions under fair or just 
conditions, and on emancipating or developing productive forces. 
This represents a crucial step taken in building the basic 
frame of socialist market economic systems. Along with 
implementing these measures, reforms will be shifted from 
dealing with shallow-rooted problems to deep-rooted ones and 
will directly deal with the deep-rooted economic relations and 
contradictions. Reforms conducted by state-owned enterprises 
will be aimed at shifting from conceding profits to deeply 
straightening out property rights. Reforms conducted in 
developing markets will be deepened from chiefly conducting 
opening up among commodity markets to establishing the markets 
of essential factors of production. Reforms conducted in 
macroeconomic management will be carried out by chiefly doing 
away with the mandatory plan and delegation of power to lower 
levels by building systems of managerial measures and 
operational mechanisms. Reforms conducted in tax systems, in 
financial affairs, and in systems of investing and raising money 
will be favorable for separating the ownership and business 
right of enterprises from the official departments and for 
creating an equal environment for market competition. 
Therefore, the significance of various reforms we face is very 
great and important. Party committees and governments at all 
levels must fully discern the important significance and pay 
attention to the following several tasks while conducting 
organizational guidance over reforms: First, we should enhance 
study and training and organize cadres at all levels, 
particularly leading cadres at or above the county-section 
level, to earnestly study the "decision" adopted at the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. Second, we 
should enhance propaganda through media and do a good job in 
propaganda and explaining various reform measures by adopting a 
lively style loved by the masses. Third, we should foster the 
idea of "taking the whole country into account" and consciously 
achieve subordinating lower units to their higher authorities 
and having the partial observe the whole. Fourth, we should 
correctly deal with the relation between reform and development 
and integrate the enforcement of various reforms with the 
economic development of our own localities and departments to 
truly reach the goal of emancipating productive forces. Fifth, 
we should correctly deal with the relation between reform and 
stability; uphold the mass line; and deeply and successfully 
conduct the work concerning the masses so as to ensure stability 
in politics and society. 
  While doing a good job in grasping in an overall way every 
reform set in the central arrangements, we should concentrate 
our efforts on grasping reform in the following five aspects 
next year: 1) By emphasizing the work of boosting large- and 
medium-sized enterprises, we should shift the operational 
mechanism of enterprises and establish modern enterprise 
systems. We should organize 100 large- and medium-sized 
enterprises in the province to take up the pilot work of 
enforcing the shareholding system and establish modern 
enterprise systems with the main contents of enterprise legal 
person systems, limited responsibility systems, and 
scientifically organized systems. Small- and medium-sized 
enterprises that earn little profits or lose money should adopt 
various measures to turn themselves into enterprises run by the 
people, while remaining state-owned or public-owned or to lease 
and sell themselves out. We should actively promote the 
transformation of the property right system and establish a 
property right supervision mechanism to make sure that 
state-owned assets maintain and increase their value, and we 
should also conscientiously explore specific measures to 
eliminate enterprises' historical burden and social burden. We 
should enliven the use of the assets in stock and facilitate the 
restructuring of the organization of enterprises to promote the 
fluidity and reshuffling of the property right of enterprises. 
2) We should deepen the rural reform, with the focus on 
developing high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficient 
large-scale agriculture and adjusting the production setup of 
agriculture. In particular, the following three tasks should be 
taken: We should stabilize and improve the responsibility 
system with household-based contracts as the major form and the 
dual operating system combining unified operation with 
independent operation and strengthen the unified service 
function of township and village collective economic 
organizations. We should establish and improve the socialized 
service system, greatly develop the integrated management of 
farming, breeding, and processing; of marketing, supply, and 
production; and of trade, industry, and agriculture; lead the 
decentralized household operation to link to the integrated 
large market, and promote the establishment and development of 
various rural specialized commodity bases and regional pillar 
industries. We should greatly develop the rural cooperative 
shareholding system to enable town and township collective 
enterprises to change their operating mechanism and establish a 
new enterprise system more rapidly. We should continue to 
implement the various policies favorable to agriculture and make 
unremitting efforts to reduce the burdens on peasants. 3) We 
should further cultivate and develop urban and rural market 
system and facilitate the shaping of a integrated, open, 
competitive, and orderly large market. The general demand is to 
greatly cultivate and develop the market for essential elements 
of production, improve the commodity market, and standardize 
market activities according to law. 4) Party and government 
organs at all levels should actively facilitate institutional 
reform and establish the state public service system. They 
should complete this task in a well-guided and orderly manner in 
three years beginning next year and see to it that their 
functions are changed, relations are brought into better 
balance, organizations are streamlined, and efficiency is 
improved. 5) We should actively establish the provincial-level 
macroeconomic regulation and control system in the process to 
promote the reform of state financial and tax, monetary, 
investment, and planning systems. 
  3. We should regard opening to the outside world and 
developing the export-oriented economy as a strategic task to 
promote the entire economic development. 
  Opening to the outside world means to open our doors to 
conduct extensive economic, political, scientific and 
educational, and cultural exchanges and cooperation with the 
countries and regions outside the country and outside the 
border. Not only should we fully assimilate and use all the 
advanced technology and experiences of the world that are useful 
to us, but also, guided by the world market, we should actively 
develop the export-oriented economy and participate in 
international division of work, international exchanges, and 
competition of the international market. Through bilateral 
exchanges and cooperation, we should realize the rational 
distribution of funds, personnel, technology, and other 
essential elements of production. Opening to the outside world 
and developing the export-oriented economy enable us to 
effectively use the numerous favorable development opportunities 
provided to us by the international economic environment, to 
rapidly promote the adjustment and improvement of our industrial 
composition and product mix, and to raise the starting point and 
quality of our economic strategies, link with the international 
market more rapidly, and promote the entire economic development 
and social progress through the breakthrough in the 
export-oriented economy. To build an economically strong 
province, we should first build ourselves into a strong province 
in opening up. All trades and professions and all localities 
should open to the outside world more rapidly, use foreign trade 
to lead the domestic trade, use domestic trade to promote 
foreign trade, and strive for a faster and greater development 
in the export-oriented economy. 
  First, we should persistently pay attention to and develop 
foreign capital utilization, foreign trade, and foreign economic 
relations simultaneously. We should adopt various channels and 
various measures to introduce foreign capital to enterprises of 
various ownerships and enterprises in various fields. Focusing 
on using foreign capital to transplant and technically transform 
large- and medium-sized enterprises, we should accelerate 
enterprises' technical transformation projects and strive to 
complete a number of such projects next year. All levels, all 
departments, and all economic and noneconomic departments should 
develop their respective advantages to strengthen ties with 
international consortia, large enterprises, monetary 
organizations, and noted figures and to build the bridge for 
bringing in foreign capital and loans from abroad so as to 
strive to make next year's amount of foreign capital we use 
double that of this year. We should truly implement the idea of 
developing large-scale foreign trade with everyone's efforts; 
pool the efforts of all fields; export through numerous ports; 
increase the growth rates of export volume, foreign exchange 
earning; and foreign exchange received to the same level as the 
growth rate of Hebei's gross national product, and make the 
growth rate of local ordinary trade and exports of the "three 
types of foreign-funded enterprises" equal to or surpass the 
national average. We should actively develop the tourist 
business involving foreigners. We should greatly intensify 
labor service export and contracts for projects abroad, provide 
great support for the localities and enterprises with favorable 
conditions to export technology, equipment, and funds, and 
develop overseas enterprises to change the backward outlook of 
such work. 
  Second, we should make continuous efforts to develop the 
coastal areas of Bohai Sea and the areas around Beijing and 
Tianjin, achieve breakthroughs in key fields more rapidly, and 
promote this work in an orderly manner. Leaders of the four 
cities of Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, Cangzhou, and Shijiazhuang, 
which are on the forefront of the opening up of the coastal 
areas of Bohai Sea, should try every means to achieve some 
significant breakthroughs in opening to the outside world and 
speed up the change of the focus from domestic-oriented economy 
to export-oriented economy. Relying chiefly on Beijing and 
Tianjin, we should promote multidirectional opening to the 
localities of the country and, in the meantime, promote 
introduction of investment from abroad through the lateral 
cooperation at home in order to lead a great development in 
opening to the outside world. 
  Third, the province, as well as all cities and prefectures, 
should define their work priorities and act in coordination and 
pool efforts in opening to the outside world. From now on, 
cities, prefectures, and enterprises should gradually become the 
major participators in establishing foreign economic ties and 
introducing foreign capital from abroad. Beginning next year, 
the province should devote major efforts to the priorities of 
work, namely establishing ties with major customers, bringing in 
large projects from abroad, and winning the support of the 
various large central ministries and commissions taking charge 
of the work involving foreign countries, in addition to holding 
one or two large investment-inviting activities every year so 
that the scale and level of opening to the outside world can be 
improved continuously. 
  4. Every means should be adopted to make the 1994 economic 
construction at the same development level of 1993 or surpass it. 
  The major targets of Hebei's 1994 economic development has 
been defined, but, in carrying out actual work, we should strive 
to reach or surpass the 14-percent gross national product 
increase registered in 1993. 
  First, we should aim at achieving a fairly comfortable 
standard of living when drawing up overall plans for rural work. 
Efforts should be devoted chiefly to the following three tasks. 
1) We should speed up the development of high-yield, 
good-quality, and high-efficient agriculture. In grain 
production next year, we should ensure steady growth, and, in 
cotton production, we should be determined to change the 
large-scale decline of output due to failure to fulfill planting 
acreage plans. After this, we should adjust and optimize 
agricultural structure more rapidly in line with market demand 
in order to improve efficiency and increase the income of 
peasants. 2) In line with the principle of attaching equal 
importance to development and improvement, we should continue to 
speed up township enterprise development. By carrying out 
technical transformation and bringing in funds from abroad, we 
should support and build a number of export-oriented township 
enterprises that adopt new technology, produce good products, 
and create high efficiency, expand their scale, and develop 
enterprise groups. We should draw up overall plans to 
coordinate township enterprise development with the construction 
of small industrial zones and small cities, and promote the 
concentration of township enterprises in geographical 
arrangements to improve the intensive management level. We 
should establish a strict mechanism of incentives and link the 
interests of township and village cadres with the development of 
local rural economy, especially the development of township 
enterprises. 3) We should achieve success in family planning to 
improve per capita production and per capita income. We should 
conscientiously implement the system of responsibility for 
population targets and make family planning a decisive criterion 
for appraisal of work. 
  Second, by regarding as an emphasis the readjustment of 
structure and the increase of economic results, we should 
accelerate the development of industrial enterprises. We should 
guide enterprises to study, calculate, and open markets; to 
establish a mechanism with rapid and flexible market reaction; 
to enhance their sale strategy; and to improve their production 
in a timely manner according to development and changes in the 
market. We should reinforce the strength in structure 
readjustment and guide enterprises to improve their products 
along the direction of high- and-new technologies, fine quality, 
famous trade mark, standardized operation, and international 
market standards. Efforts should be made to continuously 
enforce the "dragon-tiger plan" and the "plan for establishing a 
large number of enterprises in six fields," to achieve in 
imposing clear duties on these enterprises and having them be 
closely coordinated, to promote progress in enforcing the two 
plans each year, and to carry forward the plans through to the 
end. We should organize 100 senior specialists to spend one 
year on investigation and study so as to enable them to put 
forward suggestions and plans for our province to readjust 
product mix during the "Ninth Five-Year Plan" period. We should 
have the out-dated enterprises enhance their technical 
renovations. From 1994 to the beginning of 1997, our province 
will have its industrial enterprises covered by the budget 
conduct technical renovations in line with the demands of 
products' renewal so as to upgrade the industrial quality as a 
whole. 
  Third, we should adopt every possible way and means to 
overcome funding difficulties and accelerate the construction of 
infrastructure and key projects. We should strive for 
investments with fundamental and competitive characters which 
conform with the state industrial policies, as well as for the 
credit funds provided by the state-owned police-lending banks 
and the monetary institutions. Meanwhile, by having our feet 
firmly planted in the province, we should extensively open the 
channels for raising funds. Efforts should be made to vigorously 
enforce the shareholding system and to establish shareholding 
companies especially in charge of raising shares for 
construction projects. We should formulate as soon as possible 
the "provisional regulations on management over raising social 
funds," standardize the act of raising funds, and guide the 
enforcement of special policies on raising funds for key 
construction projects. 
  Fourth, we should continuously encourage and support the 
development of individually run and privately owned enterprises 
in both urban and rural areas. The united front work 
departments, the federations of industry and commerce, and the 
industrial and commercial bureaus at all levels should be 
closely coordinated and do a good job in line with their work 
division in rendering services and creating a fine environment 
and condition for the rapid development of individually run and 
privately owned enterprises. 
  Fifth, we should accelerate urban construction with the main 
tasks of building residential houses for urban people and 
promote progress in modernizing urban areas. In line with 
enforcing the state "1994-1996 project of having the people live 
in peace," a good job should be done in dealing with the housing 
problems encountered by the households that don't have homes, 
whose per capita housing acreage is under four square meters, 
and that are cramped with adult children. We should regard 
teachers of middle and primary schools, medical and cultural 
workers, and the staff members and workers of small industrial 
and commercial enterprises as special targets for assistance. 
We should work out measures to help them deal with their 
housing problems. Efforts should be made to actively promote 
reform in the housing system of urban areas and to enforce the 
rational division among the state, collectives, and individuals 
of the burden of housing construction. By meeting the needs of 
opening up, we should enhance the construction of 
infrastructures and reinforce the bearing capacity and 
attraction of urban areas in opening themselves to the outside 
world. 
  Sixth, we should accelerate the development of tertiary 
industry. By proceeding from their reality, localities and 
departments should formulate rational plans for developing the 
industry; define their work emphasis; actively conduct guidance; 
and accelerate the development of this industry. We should 
concentrate our efforts on firmly grasping the development of 
industries and trades that are extremely short and that should 
be developed urgently. Efforts should be made to have the 
state-owned, collectively run, individually run, privately 
owned, and foreign-funded enterprises develop the tertiary 
industry simultaneously and to adopt multiple and flexible 
styles to make a greater breakthrough in developing this 
industry. 
  Seventh, we should accelerate the pace of integrating 
science, technology, and education with the economy and improve 
as soon as possible the province's backward outlook in science, 
technology, and education. Through efforts made in 1994 and 
1995, we will enable a large number of large and medium-sized 
enterprises to establish their scientific research units that 
are actually able to develop new technologies and products. 
Efforts should be made to stabilize and reinforce the 
contingents of agricultural scientific and technological 
personnel, and to set up or improve the network of popularizing 
the agricultural technologies. In particular, we should 
organize or establish a large number of service organizations 
for science, agriculture, and trade so as to form a "unified" 
system. Through the elimination caused by the competition we 
should support, by aiming at the survived key projects, the 
development and construction conducted by the high- and-new tech 
industrial parks and improve or develop a large number of 
technical markets. We should greatly encourage the 
establishment of a number of non-governmental scientific 
research institutes, non-governmental scientific and 
technological enterprises, scientific and technological 
enterprises owned by the state but run by the people, and "three 
types of foreign-funded enterprises" engaged mainly in 
scientific and technological development. Meanwhile, we should 
pay attention to education next year. The focus is that 
colleges and universities should deepen the educational reform 
and succeed in the adjustment of their layout and curricula; 
vocational and technical education should be consolidated, 
improved, and upgraded from the current level, and 100 
vocational education centers newly established; urban adult 
education should continue to be made successful, and the 
transfer of rural redundant labor forces should be resolved 
through rural adult education; great attention should be given 
to elementary education to prevent it from declining or being 
affected; and the "teachers' law" should be conscientiously 
enforced, and mistakes in wage payments to teachers should no 
longer occur beginning next year. 
  5. We should adhere to the strategic principle of attending 
to two tasks simultaneously and being competent in both and 
should clarify the tasks, systematize the work, and specify the 
responsibility for building the socialist spiritual civilization 
and improving democracy and the legal system. 
  In line with this demand, we should focus on the following 
work next year: 
  First, we should continue deepening the anticorruption 
struggle. The general requirements on next year's work of 
building a clean government and opposing corruption are to 
prevent recurrence of the problems that have already been 
corrected, step up efforts to address the problems that have not 
been thoroughly solved, and take remedial measures to make up 
for perfunctory work; and do a better job in addressing other 
problems that the masses are most dissatisfied with. New 
requirements should be put forward based on new conditions on 
leading cadres' honesty and self-restraint; measures should be 
intensified to step up the investigation and handling of major 
and serious cases; the work to ban unwarranted pooling of funds, 
wanton requisition of donations, and exaction of fees should be 
carried out through to the end until actual results are 
achieved; and conscientious efforts should be made to straighten 
out and thoroughly correct the problems of some leading cadres 
at and above the county level who vied with each other to buy 
deluxe cars, used public cars for private purposes in violation 
of regulations, wasted public funds in lavish wining and dining 
and buying gifts, and abused power to occupy excessively large 
houses, build private houses, or decorate private houses with 
public funds. 
  Second, we should make great efforts to check four unhealthy 
trends. We should strictly investigate and resolutely put an 
end to the four unhealthy trends of abusing power for extortion, 
swindling, cheating customers, and telling lies, making false 
records and accounts, and selling fake and inferior commodities, 
which have seriously affected Hebei's reform and opening up and 
its image in foreign countries; local and trade protectionism; 
as well as partiality in law enforcement for the benefits of 
friends and relatives. 
  Third, we should be more resolute in eliminating 
pornography, 
the abduction of women and children, and the "six vices." We 
should adopt the legal means to sternly crack down on all ugly 
phenomena, such as production and sales of pornographic 
products, prostitution and visits to prostitutes, abduction and 
trafficking of women and children, gambling, and sex business. 
  Fourth, we should continue the struggle of "dealing strict 
blows." We should make unremitting efforts to sternly crack 
down on serious criminal and economic offenses and organize 
special struggles in a timely manner to correct the practice of 
replacing punishment according to criminal law with fines and 
excessive leniency in punishment. Public security departments, 
procuratorates, courts, and judicial departments should 
strengthen coordination and cooperation to successfully perform 
their function of dictatorship. 
  Fifth, we should achieve success in comprehensively 
improving 
public security. Through the comprehensive improvement 
activities, we should reduce incidence of crimes, juvenile 
delinquency, and serious mishaps and prevent the ugly phenomena 
from spreading in society. Responsibility for the targets of 
the comprehensive improvement activities should be resolutely 
assigned to units and individuals. 
  Sixth, we should intensify the maintenance of stability 
among the grass roots. In regard to the instable factors, the 
grass-roots party and government organizations should 
realistically assume responsibility in order to nip problems in 
the bud so as to avoid their expansion and a worsened situation. 
All localities should strengthen the work of handling visitors 
and incoming letters from the masses; strengthen calculation and 
prevention; and resolutely end and reduce the rising tendencies 
of collective visits, particularly collective visits to the 
province and Beijing. It is necessary to set up and perfect the 
setup of the grass-roots security and civil mediation 
organizations so as to strengthen the improvement of social 
order by the masses. 
  Seventh, we should pay attention to the work toward 
nationalities and religions. We should pay attention to 
implementing policies for nationalities and religions. It is 
necessary to vigorously promote and support the development of 
the regional economy in the areas inhabited by the minority 
nationalities. The proper religious activities should be 
respected and protected. The unlawful activities of using 
underground religious forces to disturb and damage social 
stability should strictly be watched and legally be eliminated 
and attacked. 
  Eighth, we should make big progress in setting up the legal 
system. In line with the requirements of the new situation and 
according to the order of importance and urgency, the provincial 
people's congress and the provincial government should work out 
plans to quicken the pace of economic legislation. 
Simultaneously, we should conscientiously achieve propaganda 
and education on the legal system and examine and supervise the 
enforcement of laws. 
  Ninth, we should improve and strengthen media and 
propaganda. 
We should pay full attention to and bring into play the 
propaganda departments and the mass media's functions for 
encouraging, inspiring, and guiding the masses; and strengthen 
the propaganda and education on patriotism, collectivism, 
socialism, Comrade Jiang Z emin's pioneering spirit, and 
revolutionary traditions. We should intensify the propaganda on 
opening to the outside world and expand the influence over the 
outside world. We should continue to regulate and control the 
guidance of mass media and do a good job in running the press, 
broadcasting stations, and television stations. 
  Tenth, we should vigorously carry out the mass cultural and 
sports activities. We should build and rebuild some basic 
cultural and sports facilities and pay attention to building 
cultural facilities in enterprises, neighborhood committees, and 
campuses. We should organize more high-quality and high-level 
performance and competition activities and conduct various kinds 
of mass cultural and sports activities that various kinds of 
people are able to participate in. 
  Eleventh, we should further conduct the activities of 
creating civilized units and civilized villages. In conducting 
the army- civilian joint civility campaign, the 
policemen-civilian joint civility campaign, and the campaign of 
striving to be "double-support models," we should closely 
proceed from reality and pay attention to real efficiency. We 
should vigorously disseminate and popularize Jidong cement 
plant's experience in creating a civilized unit and cultivating 
civilized staff members and workers. We should vigorously 
advocate and organize such autonomous organizations as mass 
"wedding and funeral councils," "moral assessment societies," 
and "antigambling women's societies;" and carry forward good 
folk customs. 
  Twelve, the mass organizations should bring into play their 
functions for building the socialist spiritual civilization. 
Under the leadership of the party committees, mass 
organizations should positively engage themselves in the 
construction of spiritual civilization, bring their roles into 
play, and organize the activities with their own 
characteristics. We should go to the grass roots to understand 
the people's thinking, expectations, opinions, and requirements 
and conduct the ideological and political work among the masses. 
  All departments concerned under the provincial party 
committee and the provincial government should define targets 
for the fulfillment of the aforementioned 12 tasks, define 
responsibility to each unit and person, and also set up a 
strict, scientific, and simple examination and assessment method. 
  6. The emphasis of party building should be placed on 
successfully conducting various basic work and upgrading the 
basic quality of the politics and careers of cadres. 
  We should have the party manage its affairs and the first 
leading personnel of party committees should attach importance 
on grasping party building. We should make all out efforts to 
enhance the construction of leading bodies and of cadres' 
contingent as a whole by regarding as a target the work of 
upgrading the leadership level of leading bodies and the basic 
quality of cadres' contingent and by proceeding from first 
dealing with existing problems. 
  First, we should regard the study of Volume 3 of 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and the theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the 
fundamental task in building party organizations and in having 
the cadres' contingent carry out ideological and work style 
construction. We should realistically do a good job in firmly 
grasping the study. We should stress the study carried out with 
a systematic manner; accurately understand and master its 
fundamental ideology and viewpoints; pay attention to 
integrating the theoretical study with experience summation; and 
integrate the study with that of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
scientific attitude, pioneering spirit, and revolutionary 
morale, with that of the decision adopted at the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and with the 
promotion of programs in reform, opening up, and economic 
construction. Localities, departments, and individuals should 
strive to successfully deal with their prominent problems in 
line with the integration between theories and practice. Through 
steady study, we should vigorously upgrade the level of cadres 
at all levels. 
  Second, we should realistically enhance the construction of 
leading bodies at all levels. 1) We should adopt multiple 
styles and measures to enhance the education conducted among 
cadres at all levels and particularly among the leading cadres 
at or above the county level or of large and medium-sized 
enterprises with regard to the basic knowledge of socialist 
market economic systems. 2) We should strictly enforce the 
democratic centralism and uphold or perfect the specific systems 
under democratic centralism so as to ensure the smooth 
circulation of orders issued by the central authorities and the 
provincial party committee and in order to maintain the unity 
fostered by leading bodies. 3) On the premise of maintaining 
the basic stability of leading bodies and in line with the needs 
of building leading bodies and developing their work, we should 
conduct consolidation in a planned, step by step manner among a 
number of them and carry out personnel exchanges of cadres. We 
should relentlessly and resolutely consolidate the leading 
bodies that have indulged in disunity, still have not mended 
their mistakes through education, adversely affected the work, 
long lagged behind in work, and have committed some serious 
problems. 4) A good job should be done in vigorously training 
reserve cadres and upgrading their quality. We should dispatch 
a large number of reserve cadres to enterprises or rural 
villages to have them be trained there and upgrade or increase 
their working capability in practice. We should increase the 
proportion of reserve cadres at the provincial, 
city-prefectural, and county levels, who come from the large and 
medium-sized enterprises, the scientific research units, and the 
higher educational institutions. 5) We should explore and 
formulate a set of appropriate policies and methods to foster a 
grand and outstanding contingent of entrepreneurs, appropriate 
for market competition. We should attach importance on building 
the contingent of entrepreneurs as we did for the contingents of 
local party and government leading cadres. We should not 
rigidly adhere to a form in selecting or introducing outstanding 
talented personnel and adopt effective measures of encouragement 
to stabilize the contingent of entrepreneurs, to create a fine 
environment for the contingent's healthy growth, and to enable a 
large number of outstanding talented personnel to show their 
talent. 
  Third, we should enhance the managerial systems of cadres 
and 
establish an effective mechanism that can appraise the cadres' 
achievements in a scientific way and employ cadres in line with 
their achievements. The provincial party committee has decided 
that effective from 1994 the province will conduct a 
comprehensive appraisal at the end of every year according to 
the "work outline" of the provincial party committee and the 
demand set by the provincial people's government with regard to 
the attainment of certain objectives over the work done by 
various departments and commissions under the provincial party 
committee, by various departments and bureaus under the 
provincial people's government, and by various cities and 
prefectures; as well as over the work done by leading bodies and 
cadres. Meanwhile, appraised results will be regarded as the 
main basis for replenishing and reinforcing leading bodies and 
for carrying out rational readjustment among cadres. Those with 
outstanding results should be commended; those with necessary 
conditions should be promoted, put in important positions, and 
awarded; those who are sluggish in making progress, stagnant for 
many years, or even drop in ranking should be given a yellow 
plate as warning and should change their outlook within a fixed 
time; and those who make no improvement in work, are seriously 
disunited, have unhealthy trends and many problems, practice 
fraud, incite great dissatisfaction among the masses, and cause 
serious problems that have adverse effect on the country should 
be resolutely reshuffled. In short, those with achievements 
will have official posts, and those without will not. Only when 
we promote the cadres who truly have political integrity and 
ability and have scored achievements and demote those who have 
not, will we have hope for building an economically strong 
province. For this reason, organization departments should 
first straighten out their work styles, appoint personnel on 
their merits, and never appoint personnel by favoritism or 
appoint personnel to pursue benefits, not to speak of appointing 
personnel according to their factions. Organization departments 
at all levels should further emancipate the mind, update their 
concepts, proceed from the "three advantages" in doing 
everything, and evaluate and organize leading bodies and select 
and use cadres to meet the needs of reform, opening up, and 
economic development so as to serve as good advisers and 
assistants to party committees. 
  Fourth, we should attach great importance to improving 
grass-roots organizations and exert great efforts to strengthen 
basic work. In the work to improve the party's grass-roots 
organizations, rural areas are the weak link, and attention 
should be concentrated on it next year. 1) We should solve the 
problems of party branches whose work has paralyzed or half 
paralyzed, which account for 3 percent of Hebei's total rural 
party branches. Regarding the five types of villages pointed 
out in the provincial party committee's "work outlines," we 
should successfully rectify and transform them according to set 
targets a group at a time. 2) We should attach importance to 
improving party organizations of township enterprises. Township 
enterprises without party organizations should step up efforts 
to establish them; and those with party organizations should 
improve their systems and start their activities as soon as 
possible and enable them to play a good role as a political 
guarantee. 3) We should adopt various measures to train all 
rural grass-roots cadres through various forms in two to three 
years. 4) We should study and formulate a package of systematic 
methods for management for the cultivation, promotion, 
appraisal, appointment and removal, training, reward and 
punishment, and post retirement benefits of rural cadres. 5) We 
should greatly encourage cadres at various levels, including 
grass-roots cadres, to develop the work styles of doing 
practical work and telling the truth and to refrain from 
switching their behavior according to the intention of higher 
levels and the expression of leaders, boasting by exaggerating 
about their experiences and achievements, and telling lies and 
making false records and accounts to harm the party, the state, 
and themselves. "Fake and inferior" activities in leadership 
work are even more harmful than the "fake and inferior" products 
of enterprises, and they should be resolutely eliminated. 
Cadres at all levels should greatly develop the spirit of 
trying to distinguish themselves and be the best and develop the 
work style of seeking truth. They should concentrate their 
minds and efforts on doing work in a down- to-earth manner, 
bringing more realistic benefits to the people, and making more 
contributions to Hebei's rapid and healthy economic development 
so that they can upgrade their work to a new level and achieve 
new and still greater progress.

Hebei Province, at the Seventh Plenary Session of the Fourth 
Hebei Provincial CPC Committee on 23 December: "Strengthen 
Reform, Open Wider to the Outside World, Accelerate Development, 
and Build a Strong Province"] 
  [Text]1. Current Provincial Economic Situation 
  Under the correct leadership of the party Central Committee 
and the State Council, the provincial party committee and 
government have led the people throughout the province to 
conscientiously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the 
14th party congress since the beginning of this year and, aiming 
at the general objective of building an economically strong 
province, have seized the opportunity to deepen reform, open 
wider to the outside world, accelerate development, and 
comprehensively implement the "outlines of Hebei's economic 
development," thus achieving notable results in economic 
construction, reform, opening up, and other undertakings. 
Following last year's rapid development, the economy has 
continued developing rapidly, and the general situation has been 
good. This year's gross domestic product is expected to exceed 
140 billion yuan, an increase of 14 percent, which is one of the 
largest annual increases registered since reform and opening up 
started. A fairly good harvest has been won in agricultural 
production despite catastrophic disasters, with grain output 
expected at 47.6 billion jin, up 8.9 percent from the preceding 
year. In industrial production, we have achieved simultaneous 
increase in growth rate and efficiency and attained the target 
of increasing the increased value of industry, profits and 
taxes, and the value of fixed assets and raising Hebei's ranking 
in the country in the overall index of industrial economic 
efficiency. The annual entire industrial output value is 
expected to exceed 200 billion yuan, up 25 percent from the 
preceding year. Rapid growth has continued in fixed asset 
investment, with the annual social investment in fixed assets 
expected at 45 billion yuan, up 34 percent. Township 
enterprises have registered substantial growth in both 
production and efficiency. Their annual output value is 
expected at 170 billion yuan, up 70 percent. The endeavor of 
opening to the outside world has made a new headway. The number 
of the three types of foreign-funded enterprises newly 
registered this year is expected at 1,700, and the registered 
foreign capital $2.26 billion, up 75.9 and 77.2 percent, 
respectively. The annual volume of exports may reach $1.95 
billion, up 9.6 percent. Revenues have grown steadily, with the 
annual amount expected to rise by 35.9 percent to reach 13.5 
billion yuan, thus a basic balance between revenues and 
expenditures can be achieved. The monetary situation has 
notably improved, and the shortage of funds has been initially 
eased. The economic structural reform has entered a new stage, 
and achievements in transforming the enterprise operating 
mechanism have been won for the present stage. 
  Judging from the general situation, the province has scored 
great achievements in economic construction, reform, and opening 
up in 1993. Compared with other provinces, however, Hebei's 
ranking in the country has not changed, and its gap from 
advanced provinces has widened. 
  A specific analysis of the province's economic operation 
showed that we have the following problems and gaps. 1) 
Agricultural development has been sluggish, peasants' income has 
not increased, and cotton production has declined by a large 
margin. 2) Structural adjustment has proceeded slowly, our 
products are of a low standing and have a small share in the 
market, and the small proportion of finely processed products 
with high additional value has yet to be notably changed. The 
state sector of the economy still accounts for a small 
proportion. 3) The extent of reform is not large enough, and 
the endeavor of opening up has proceeded slowly. In opening to 
the outside world, we still fail to develop foreign capital 
utilization, foreign trade, and foreign economic relations 
simultaneously. 4) The steps to achieve scientific and 
technological progress are small, and only a small number of 
scientific and technological achievements has been transformed. 
2. The Guiding Ideology and Major Objective of 1994 
Economic Work. 
  The year 1994 is a year for continuously maintaining a rapid 
economic increase on the basis of achieving a rapid economic 
development in our province for two successive years, a major 
year for accelerating the establishment of the socialist market 
economic structure, and a crucial year for successfully 
fulfilling the Eighth Five-Year Plan and for doubling the GNP 
ahead of schedule in the whole province's national economy. In 
accordance with the guidelines of the national economic work 
conference and our province's actual situation, the guiding 
ideology of next year's economic work is to take Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics as the guidance, conscientiously implement the 
guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party 
Central Committee, and accelerate the pace of building the 
socialist market economic structure in line with the overall 
idea of strengthening reform, expanding reform, accelerating 
development, raising efficiency, and promoting a sustained, 
speedy, and sound national economy in the whole province. 
  In line with the aforementioned guiding ideology, the major 
objectives of next year's economic development are: The GNP 
should increase more than 11 percent over this year, of which, 
the increased value of primary industry should increase 4 
percent, and that of the secondary and tertiary industries more 
than 14 percent. In line with the demand of the objective of 
building an economically strong province, we should strive to 
fulfill this objective in a better manner in the course of 
implementation and doing practical work in an effort to 
accelerate the pace of accelerating the building of an 
economically strong province. At present, we are facing a 
hard-won good opportunity for reform and opening up. First, next 
year the state will issue a series of major reform measures to 
instill vitality into national economic development. Second, 
through strengthening and improving macroeconomic regulation and 
control, the short supply of essential production factors, such 
as funds, should be alleviated. Third, during the next few 
years, the production capacity of major products and the 
supporting capacity of infrastructure facilities should be 
enhanced to a further extent. Fourth, areas around the Bohai 
Bay should become new hot spots for foreign investment. Fifth, 
further emancipating minds, seizing opportunity, and 
accelerating development should become the common understanding 
of the broad masses of cadres at the higher and lower levels 
across the province. Meanwhile, we should also recognize that 
many problems and difficulties will exist in next year's 
economic development, and the "bottleneck" restrictions, such as 
the shortage of power, transport facilities, and water 
resources, will remain serious, funds will remain tight, and 
industrial raw materials, cotton, in particular, will be in 
short supply. Judging from the overall situation, comparing the 
favorable factors with the unfavorable factors, the former have 
accounted for a major part. 
<H3>  3. We Should Persist in Advancing This Work in an All-Around 
Manner and Making Breakthroughts in Major Points in an Effort to 
Accelerate the Pace of Reform in the Whole Province. </H3>
  Many reform measures will be issued next year, however, the 
central aspect is enterprise reform and promotion of the modern 
enterprise system. 1) We should continue to deeply implement 
the "enterprise law," "regulation," and the "implementation 
method," and completely implement all rights and 
responsibilities of enterprises in places where needed. 2) We 
should continue to improve all sorts of operational forms, and 
actively popularize the experiences in changing mechanism and 
promoting development of different enterprises, including Handan 
Iron and Steel Company, Tangshan Haomen Group, and Yinggeleilan 
Company of Xuanhua Iron and Steel Company. 3) We should 
carefully grasp the experimental work of establishing the modern 
enterprise system. In addition to conscientiously organizing 
experiments in some state designated units, the provincial 
authorities will also conduct such experiments in 100 
enterprises. 4) We should actively promote reform of the 
property rights system, and improve property rights relations. 
Next year we should transform and reorganize 300 enterprises 
with the experiment of shareholding system, and strive to make 
the figure reach 400. 5) We should actively promote some 
property management forms, such as state-owned people-run or 
public-owned people-run forms, rental operation, operation on a 
commission basis, auction or transfer of property, in some small 
state-owned enterprises or money-losing medium-sized 
enterprises. 6) We should continue to decontrol the development 
of non-state economic sector and cultivate the new economic 
growing point. 
  According to the unified arrangements of the central 
authorities, we should firmly make good preparations for 
coordinating the implementation of reform measures in an effort 
to ensure the smooth implementation of the central reform 
measures. 
  On the reform of the financial and tax system. The State 
Council decided that from 1 January next year, all provinces, 
autonomous regions, municipalities, and cities with provincial 
status in state planning should carry out the tax distribution 
system. According to the basic principles as defined by the 
central authorities and on the basis of the distribution pattern 
as defined in the current financial system, the province should 
also gradually merge the financial management system with the 
tax assignment system on the basis of a rational division of 
power with the city and prefectural authorities. 
  On the reform of the financial system. We should firmly 
attend to this work which is conducive to Hebei's economic 
development. First, we should strive to increase the setup of 
various financial organs and widen the channels for collecting 
and circulating capital. Second, we should try every possible 
means to organize savings deposits and stabilize the resources 
of credits. Third, we should intensify enterprise management 
and enhance the returns on use of capital and enterprises' 
ability in repaying loans. Simultaneously, the departments 
concerned should strengthen the selection of projects and 
enhance the work of making reports on the selected projects in 
an effort to make increasingly more projects be listed in the 
state plan and to gain the support by the policy-lending banks. 
  On the reform of the investment and capital circulation 
system. We should firmly arrange, by classifying the categories 
and in the order of importance, the basic investment projects, 
competitive investment projects, and public welfare investment 
projects. As for the basic projects, that should be invested 
jointly by the governments and enterprises, we should strive to 
gain the support by the state development banks. As for the 
competitive projects, we should enable enterprises to actively 
establish contacts with banks to gain the support by the 
financial departments. As for the public welfare projects that 
should be invested by the governments, we should have the funds 
covered in the plans and the budgets. It is necessary to 
strengthen the provincial construction and investment company's 
functions for making investment and circulating capital, to 
strengthen the provincial international credit and investment 
company's functions for circulating capital at home and abroad, 
and to bring their functions for collecting funds for 
construction undertakings. 
  On the reform of the foreign trade system. The reform of the 
foreign trade system is conducive to expanding the scale of 
export. At the time of quickening the reform of the managerial 
mechanisms of foreign trade enterprises, we should firmly grasp 
this favorable opportunity, adopt effective measures, positively 
organize the supply of goods, and expand the foreign exchange 
earning capability. 
  Facing the 1994 situation with more new reform measures, 
heavy tasks, and great difficulties, the party committees and 
governments at various levels, all departments, and all trades 
and professions should concentrate more attention on reform and 
promote economic development and social progress with reform. 
We should appropriately handle the relationship between reform, 
development, and social stability. We should positively, 
steadily, and orderly guide reform and lose no opportunities to 
make breakthroughs in key areas. 
<H3>  4. We Should Unswervingly Carry Out the Strategy of 
Developing the Export-Oriented Economy and Further Quicken the 
Pace of Opening to Both Domestic and Foreign Areas. </H3>
  Although our province made rather bigger strides for opening 
to the outside world in the past two years, we still far lag 
behind the coastal provinces. Therefore, we must enhance the 
sense of urgency, the sense of crisis, and the sense of 
responsibility; have greater determination, bigger daring, and 
more vitality; and lose no opportunities to firmly grasp the 
opening of the province to the outside world. 
  First, we should further emancipate our mind to understand 
anew Hebei's work of opening to the outside world. Without great 
emancipation of the mind, there will be no great opening to the 
outside world, nor great development in the economy of the 
entire province. An analysis of the current mind-set of the 
cadres at all levels in the province shows that they are 
"superficial, complacent, sluggish, and lazy." Being 
superficial means that they have merely a superficial 
understanding of opening to the outside world and implementing 
the strategy of "promoting the entire economy through the 
export-oriented economy," regarding that opening to the outside 
world means introducing some funds from abroad, establishing 
some joint ventures, and exporting more and thus is the work of 
foreign economic relations and trade departments. Being 
complacent means that they are complacent with small progress 
and small wealth, feel satisfied with the current conditions, 
and lack the spirit of making progress and the courage and 
insight of achieving great improvement, great breakthrough, and 
great development. Being sluggish means that they are slow and 
insensitive in understanding things and taking actions, thus 
missing the opportunity, widening the gap, and stopping 
development due to their wait-and-see attitude. Being lazy 
means that they lack the spirit of doing practical work and 
pioneering new work and have not totally overcome their practice 
of giving empty talk and doing superficial work. To quicken the 
pace of opening to the outside world, we should first surmount 
these four ideological obstacles. 
  Second, we should implement the strategy of promoting the 
entire economy through the export-oriented economy to bring 
about a rapid economic development. Aiming at the general 
objective of rejuvenating Hebei's economy and building an 
economically strong province, and while speeding up the opening 
up and development of the coastal areas of Bohai Sea, which are 
on the forefront of opening up, we should make active efforts to 
create favorable conditions for implementing the strategy of 
promoting the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the 
entire economy through the great development of the 
export-oriented economy. 
  Third, we should simultaneously pay attention to and 
accelerate the development of foreign trade, foreign capital 
utilization, and foreign economic relations. Guided by the 
world market, led by foreign trade, and focusing on foreign 
capital utilization, we should persistently pay attention to 
foreign trade, foreign capital utilization, and foreign economic 
relations simultaneously. In exports, we should implement the 
strategy of winning through good quality and diversifying the 
market; take the road of industrialization, conglomeration, and 
internationalization; embrace the concept of large-scale foreign 
trade; pool the efforts of foreign trade companies, integrated 
industrial and foreign trade companies, three types of 
foreign-funded enterprises, and enterprises with the autonomy in 
export and export to expand export and improve economic 
efficiency; and strive to reach the national average in foreign 
trade growth. Foreign capital should be used simultaneously in 
large, medium-sized, and small projects, in primary, secondary, 
and tertiary industries, in cities, prefectures, and counties, 
and in the various sectors of the economy; and foreign capital 
should also come from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan compatriots 
and Overseas Chinese. Foreign capital should be used in more 
areas and, in particular, key aspects. We should strive to 
expand the scale of foreign capital utilization and upgrade its 
level. We should achieve a significant breakthrough in foreign 
economic and technological cooperation next year. 
  Fourth, we should continue exerting great efforts to achieve 
success in developing the coastal cities and counties of Bohai 
Sea and the cities and counties around Beijing and Tianjin. The 
focus of next year is to comprehensively implement the strategy 
of promoting the entire economy through the export-oriented 
economy in these cities and counties, expedite their opening up, 
facilitate their lateral cooperation at home by introducing 
investment from abroad, bring in more investment from abroad by 
developing lateral cooperation at home, and turn these cities 
and counties into hot spots of investment 
  Fifth, we should improve the methods for inviting investment 
to boost the enthusiasm of all cities and prefectures, 
departments, and enterprises. Cities and Prefectures, 
departments, trades, and enterprises should gradually become the 
major participators in the activities to invite investment from 
abroad. 
<H3>  5. In Order To Accelerate Economic Development, We Must Give 
Priority to Grasping Several Tasks. </H3>
  A. The rural areas should give consideration to the overall 
situation of becoming well-off, strive to increase the income of 
peasants and herdsmen, and give priority to grasping four tasks 
well: 
  a. On the premise of guaranteeing a stable increase in grain 
production and a big upward trend in cotton production, we 
should actively optimize the agricultural structure with the 
market as our guidance. We should conscientiously implement the 
state policy on raising the grain and cotton purchasing prices 
next year, and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses 
of peasants in developing grain and cotton production. It is 
necessary to ensure that the annual total grain output will 
reach 230-235 kg or more. In next year' cotton production, we 
should work hard to bring about an upswing, increase the cotton 
growing acreage by a large margin, raise the per-unit area 
yield, and guarantee the total output. In the readjustment of 
agricultural structure, we should actively develop "high-yield, 
fine-quality, and highly-efficient" farming, and do a good job 
in organizing the implementation of the "seven- character 
project,"and the "double-thousand field project." 
  b. We should realistically grasp well the building of a 
rural 
socialized service system. On the basis of developing 
competitive products and pillar industries, we should combine 
foreign trade with industry and agriculture and marketing with 
supply and production, build service system at all levels, and 
organize the efforts of thousands of households. We should give 
priority to supporting and developing serial services, including 
the processing, transport and marketing of farm and sideline 
products. 
  c. We should actively promote the development of township 
enterprises. Next year township enterprises should regard 
accelerating development as the main melody, and strive to make 
their development rate attain or surpass the national average 
level. Particularly, counties and cities along "Bohai Bay, 
Beijing and Tianjin Municipality, and railways" should make 
their development rate and economic efficiency remarkably higher 
than the provincial average. It is necessary to actively promote 
the development of shareholding cooperative system, increase 
input in township enterprises through various channels, and 
establish a batch of large-scale enterprise groups that produce 
good products and high efficiency. 
  d. We should carry out rural family planning work in a 
down-to-earth manner. It is necessary to realistically 
strengthen leadership over family planning work, resolutely 
implement the demands of making party and government top leaders 
grasp this work personally and assume full responsibility, and 
strictly implement the system of negating all achievements if 
one's family planning work is poor. Particularly, leaders of 
counties and cities where the family planning work is backward 
and problems are numerous should exert greater efforts to grasp 
this work and to rapidly end the passive situation. 
  B. We should optimize the industrial structure, and deeply 
carry out the activity on "increasing the increased value of 
industrial enterprises, the profits and taxes of industrial 
eterprises exercising independent accounting, and local 
technological transformation investment, reducing the deficits 
of large and medium-sized industrial enterprises, and making the 
comprehensive index of industrial economic efficiency rise by 1 
percentage point." Next year the provincial industrial front 
should extensively and deeply carry out this activity with 
increasing production, ending deficits, and increasing 
efficiency as the main content. This means to increase the 
total increased value of industry by 14 to 17 prcent, of which, 
the increased value of the industrial enterprises at and above 
the township level exercising independent accounting should 
increase 12-15 percent; to increase the profits and taxes of 
industrial enterprises at and above the township level 
exercising independent accounting by 10 percent, and that of 
large and medium-sized industrial enterprises 10 percent; to 
increase technological transformation investment in local 
state-run enterprises by 25-35 percent; to reduce the deficits 
of large and medium-sized industrial enterprises by 15 percent; 
and to raise the comprehensive index of economic efficiency of 
industrial enterprises excercising independent accounting by one 
percentage point. 
  We should persist in taking the market as a guidance, and 
exert strenuous efforts to readjust the structure. In heavy 
industry, we should realistically solve the issue of 
"highly-efficient heavy industry," and in light industry, we 
should continue to implement the strategy of developing 
brand-name products, and accelerate the pace of readjustment to 
develop high and new technology and brand- name products with 
large-scale efficiency and foreign markets. We should 
accelerate the pace of technological transformation of 
enterprises. Begining next year to before 1997, we should 
completely transform our province's budgetary industrial 
enterprises once in a planned manner and group by group. We 
should actively carry out "grafting" and transformation on the 
provincial industrial front through various forms. We should 
organize the enforcement of the "dragon-tiger" plan in the 
province as a whole. In line with the development of new 
products and the renewal of out-dated products, we should 
accelerate the enforcement of the plan of "establishing a large 
number of enterprises in six fields" in 1994. 1) The first group 
of enterprises are in charge of introducing outside advanced 
technologies and assimilating them so as to turn out new 
products. 2) The second group of enterprises are in charge of 
manufacturing and developing a large number of high-and-new tech 
products. 3) The third group of enterprises are in charge of 
popularizing the superior products turned out by a large number 
of pillar industries. 4) The fourth group of enterprises are in 
charge of increasing the output of products that can earn or 
save foreign exchanges. 5) The fifth group of enterprises are in 
charge of putting into production the products turned out by a 
large number of new emerging industries. 6) The sixth group of 
enterprises are in charge of eliminating a large number of 
out-dated products and renewing a large number of new products 
with flaws. 
  We should rapidly whip on the province's industrial front an 
upsurge of learning from the influential enterprises, grasping 
powerful projects, creating products with strong competitive 
capability, and contending for being first grade. All 
enterprises should grasp the expansion of markets by regarding 
the expansion as an important task and foster an operation 
mechanism that can rapidly respond to the feedback of market 
information, exert flexible reaction, and is strong to meet 
changes. 
  A good job should be done in realistically grasping the 
industrial production at present so as to ensure a good trend of 
maintaining a rapid growth in the first quarter of 1994. 
Efforts should be made to ensure the supplies of raw or 
auxiliary materials needed by production. In particular, we 
should adopt every possible way and means to obtain the supplies 
of cotton and ensure the sufficient production conditions of 
electric power and transportation means. A good job should be 
done in carrying out connection among various links cropping up 
in the productive process. We should ensure the rapid growth of 
production the first quarter of 1994 to gain initiative for the 
annual production next year. 
  C. We should regard as an emphasis the work of accelerating 
the fostering of market systems and vigorously promote the 
development of tertiary industry. We should also regard market 
construction as a breakthrough for developing the tertiary 
industry. In building markets in 1994, we should uphold the 
principle of attaching simultaneous importance on both 
development and upgrading. The work emphasis should be placed 
on developing the markets of essential factors of various 
production. In particular, we must take a larger step in 
building the markets of finance, labor forces, talented 
personnel, technologies, information, and of trading 
enterprises' property rights. We should vigorously develop the 
intermediary organizations of markets and accelerate the 
development of self-discipline organizations of markets, 
including the offices of registration, accountants, auditors, 
and lawyers; as well as the institutions of notary and 
arbitration, chambers of commerce, and associations of various 
industries and trades. 
  D. We should increase in a rational way the scale of 
investments made in fixed assets and reinforce the reserve 
strength in developing the economy. The key to whether we can 
win over the state investments lies on the characters of our 
projects. We must make full use of the province's strong points 
of infrastructures in energy resources, communications, the 
industries of important raw materials, and water conservancy 
works; as well as the strong points of more projects for basic 
industries; so as to enable more projects in the province to be 
oriented into the state overall construction plan. We should 
also optimize the investment structure to ensure the 
construction of key projects. Meanwhile, a good job should be 
done in continuously conducting the work prior to the 
construction of projects so as to ensure "the ceaseless 
formulation of projects and the ceaseless supply of 
investments". Among the projects that have been newly put into 
construction, we should emphatically do a good job in grasping 
the construction of Shenmu-Huanghua railway and Huanghua Harbor. 
We should actively create conditions for the two large projects 
of diverting south water to the north and of building the middle 
canal of diverting the Chang Jiang's water, which have strategic 
significance on the economy of Hebei Province and the country, 
so as to ensure the two transcentury projects to be started 
within the given date. Except for successfully grasping the 
aforementioned key projects that conform with the state 
industrial policies, the province as well as various cities and 
prefectures should continue to sieve their projects so that we 
can build a large number of projects that can exert good 
economic results; are greatly needed by markets; cost less 
investments; can be completely built in a short period; can 
withdraw funds rapidly; are with high additional value; and can 
exert high benefits. In readjusting the structure of 
investments in 1994, we should adequately increase the 
proportion made in urban housing construction. In line with the 
state arrangements, we should earnestly implement the new 
methods of conducting reform in the urban housing systems and 
popularize the housing experience gained by the higher 
educational institutions of our province. 
  E. We should greatly develop science, technology, and 
education and realistically channel economic construction to the 
track of relying on scientific and technological progress and 
improving the quality of laborers. In developing science, 
technology, and education, we should focus on the following 
work. We should step up establishment and improvement of 
enterprises' scientific and technological development institutes 
to continuously improve their ability and level in high-tech 
development; and all the 741 large and medium-sized enterprises 
in the province should create favorable conditions for 
establishing scientific and technological development 
institutes, and all these institutes should develop the new 
products and new technology oriented to adjusting the structure 
and improving efficiency. We should encourage development of 
non-governmental scientific research institutes, 
non-governmental scientific and technological enterprises, the 
scientific and technological enterprises owned by the state but 
run by the people, and the three types of foreign-funded 
enterprises engaged mainly in scientific and technological 
development. We should achieve success in establishing a number 
of high- and new-tech industrial development zones and high- and 
new-tech industrial parks. We should cultivate and build a 
number of permanent technology markets, speed up transformation 
of scientific and technological achievements, and promote the 
close coordination of science and technology with the economy. 
  We should persistently put education in a strategic position 
for development on a priority basis and exert great efforts to 
train the personnel in various specialties who meet the needs of 
the socialist market economy system. We should further 
accelerate reform of the educational system to continuously 
improve the quality of instruction. We should greatly intensify 
elementary education, greatly develop vocational, technical, and 
adult education, stabilize the enrollment of colleges and 
universities, and put more efforts into the strong and highly 
competitive projects to create achievements and first-rate 
personnel. 
<H5>  6. Conscientiously Strengthen Leadership Over Economic Work </H5>
  Hebei's reform, opening up, and economic construction will 
enter a stage of new development next year. We are faced with a 
new situation in which the planned economy is being changed into 
the market economy. To comply with this new situation, we 
should conscientiously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, study well 
Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, and 
strive to master the new knowledge and new skills to manage the 
market economy. We should take the overall situation into 
consideration to ensure the smooth implementation of government 
orders. Comrades in charge of leadership work should keep the 
overall national and provincial situation in reform and 
development in view when considering the work of their own 
localities and departments and take the initiative in serving 
the overall situation. They should conduct intensive 
investigation and study and realistically change their work 
styles. Leading cadres at all levels should often go to the 
reality of life to conduct investigations and study, pay 
attention to studying new conditions, address new problems, and 
carry out the work of their own localities and departments in a 
creative manner. They should have the courage to try out the 
new moves whose worth they are certain and to blaze new trails. 
We should use typical examples as a guide and promote the 
entire work while achieving breakthroughs in key areas to 
accelerate Hebei's reform, opening up, and economic construction. 
  We should attend to two tasks simultaneously and be 
competent 
in both. While attending to economic development, we must never 
slacken efforts in building the socialist material civilization 
and in improving socialist democracy and legal system. We 
should intensify efforts to improve public security 
comprehensively and strive to eliminate the various factors 
leading to instability in society. We should continue the 
in-depth anticorruption struggle, eliminate the various ugly 
phenomena, and ensure the smooth accomplishment of the tasks of 
reform and development.

  [Text] The Hebei acrylonitrile-acrylic fiber project, a key 
project for the Eighth Five-Year Plan period, was officially 
approved for planning by the State Planning Commission. 
  The Hebei acrylonitrile-acrylic fiber project, which is to 
be 
built by Hebei and the China Petrochemical Corporation, is the 
after-process project of the Hebei ethylene project. Five units 
of equipment to produce 50,000 tonnes of acrylonitrile, 30,000 
tonnes of acrylic fibers, 6,000 tonnes of ammonium sulfide, 
2,000 tonnes of refined acetonitrile, and 10,000 tonnes of 
sodium cyanide a year will be built. Investment totals about 
1.6 billion yuan. After completed, this project will be able to 
yield fairly good economic benefits, earning more than 600 
million yuan from sales and creating more than 200 million yuan 
of profits and taxes a year. Construction of this project may 
effectively promote Hebei's textile industry and adjust its mix 
of textile goods. It will also play an important role in 
changing Hebei's long reliance on others for the supply of 
synthetic fibers and for saving foreign exchange. The 
feasibility study for this project is being stepped up and 
efforts will be made to start its construction early.

  [Text] A municipal judicial, procuratorial, and court work 
conference was held on 20 January. The conference relayed the 
guidelines of the national judicial, procuratorial, and court 
work conference and the Second (Enlarged) Plenary Session of the 
Sixth Municipal Party Committee. It also arranged, according to 
the requirements for setting up the socialist market economic 
system and quickening the development of the municipality, the 
1994 municipal judicial, procuratorial, and court work. The 
conference put forward: Under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the basic line of the party, we should 
comprehensively implement the guidelines of the 14th party 
congress and the third plenary session of the 14th party Central 
Committee; persist in the principle of "taking a two-hand 
approach and being sure that both hands are tough"; further 
strengthen and reform the judicial, procuratorial, and court 
work to suit the requirements of setting up the socialist market 
economic system; intensify the functions for exercising people's 
democratic dictatorship; forcefully deal blows to various 
criminal activities; firmly attend to investigating and handling 
major and appalling cases in the course of opposing corruption; 
provide legal guarantees and services for the socialist market 
economy; safeguard political and social stability; and create a 
good social environment for accelerating the municipality's 
reform, opening up, and economic development. 
  Present at the conference were municipal leaders, including 
Gao Dezhan, Zhang Lichang, Li Jianguo, Li Shenglin, Liu Jinfeng, 
Yang Zhihua, Song Pingshun, Zheng Zhiying, Zhang Baifeng, Zhang 
Dequan, and Zhang Guanwen. 
  Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, 
fully 
affirmed the municipality's judicial, procuratorial, and court 
work in his speech. He also extended cordial regards and 
heartfelt thanks to the vast number of cadres and policemen, the 
armed police officers and men, and all comrades who have 
diligently been working on the municipal judicial, 
procuratorial, and court fronts. He pointed out: 1994 is a key 
year to accelerate the municipality's reform, opening up, and 
modernization. Therefore, grasping favorable opportunities to 
quicken the pace of reform, opening up, and economic development 
is the major tasks of this year. There must be a stable social 
environment in order to quicken the pace of development. It is 
of peculiar importance and urgency to safeguard social and 
political stability under the new situation. So, we must put 
the safeguarding of stability in an extremely important 
position. The more we accelerate reform, opening up, and 
economic development, the more we should strengthen judicial, 
procuratorial, and court work and try every possible means to 
safeguard political and social stability. The party and 
government leading cadres at various levels should persist in 
the principle of "taking a two-hand approach and being sure that 
both hands are tough"; accurately handle the relationship among 
reform, development, and stability; conscientiously analyze 
various unstable factors at the time of grasping favorable 
opportunities to speed up the pace of development; adopt 
effective measures to safeguard social and political stability; 
and ensure the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and 
economic construction. 
  Gao Dezhan urged: The judicial, procuratorial, and court 
fronts should conscientiously do their duties and go all out to 
ensure the municipality's political and social stability. We 
should realistically expand the extent of sternly dealing blows 
to serious criminal activities and strictly and rapidly punish 
serious criminal offenders according to the law. We should 
persistently and ceaselessly wage the struggle for "wiping out 
pornography" and "eliminating six evils" and resolutely uproot 
various kinds of social evil phenomena. We should 
conscientiously study and accurately handle the contradictions 
among the people themselves in the new situation and enhance our 
foresight to do our work. We should actively engage ourselves 
in the anticorruption struggle and concentrate energy on 
investigating and handling major and appalling cases. We should 
strengthen the construction of the legal system and strengthen 
and improve judicial work, the enforcement of administrative 
laws, and supervision over the enforcement of laws. Persistently 
in the light of the principle on linking special work with the 
mass line, we should mobilize social forces, conscientiously 
fulfill our responsibilities, and exert great efforts to 
comprehensively improve social order. We should firmly foster 
the thinking of relying on the masses to safeguard social and 
political stability, further extensively disseminate and 
mobilize the masses, truly rely on the masses, do more good and 
concrete deeds for the people, and really enjoy the support of 
the people. Strictly in line with the principle that "whoever 
takes charge should assume responsibility," each level should 
attend to and guide the work of each lower level and assume 
responsibility for the fulfillment of the work of each lower 
level. 
  Gao Dezhan stressed: The party committees and governments at 
various levels should pay attention to the judicial, 
procuratorial, and court work and realistically strengthen and 
improve the party's leadership over judicial, procuratorial, and 
court work. We should support and guide the judicial, 
procuratorial, and court departments to persist in the basic 
line of the party; eliminate their obstacles and interference; 
strictly enforce laws; suit the new situation of setting up the 
socialist market economic system; strengthen investigations and 
study on judicial, procuratorial, and court work; forcefully 
give instructions according to principles and policies; and 
elevate the municipality's judicial, procuratorial, and court 
work to a new height. It is necessary to realistically 
strengthen the construction of the judicial, procuratorial, and 
court workers contingents; fill the entire cadres and 
policemen's brains with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics; and upgrade 
their awareness of firmly implementing the basic line of the 
party. We should achieve training in a well- organized and 
well-planned manner so as to upgrade the broad masses of cadres 
and policemen's political integrity and professional ability. 
We should strictly conduct education, establish strict 
demands, strictly strengthen management, further strengthen the 
improvement of administrative honesty, and educate cadres and 
policemen to be the first in diligently and honestly performing 
official duties. The leading bodies of the judicial, 
procuratorial, and court departments at various levels should 
realistically attend to their self-construction and actually 
have perfect political integrity, perfect work style, and 
perfect work performances. 
  Song Pingshun, standing committee member of the 
municipality, 
vice mayor of the municipality, and secretary of the committee 
for political science and law under the municipal party 
committee, arranged the municipality's judicial, procuratorial, 
and court work. He said: We should adopt effective measures to 
safeguard the municipality's political and social stability, 
timely alleviate various contradictions and disputes, and 
eliminate unstable factors. It is necessary to achieve the 
struggle for dealing strict blows to serious criminal offenders 
and to upgrade the prestige and quality of the struggle. We 
should strictly attack various kinds of serious criminal 
activities and continue to especially wage the struggle against 
thefts so as to continuously keep the social order stable. We 
should resolutely and strictly punish, according to the law, 
serious economic criminal activities, carefully organize and 
concentrate forces to prominently investigate and handle major 
and appalling cases, deepen the struggle against corruption, and 
safeguard the socialist market economic order. We should deepen 
the overall improvement of social order, conscientiously 
implement the system that leaders bear the responsibility for 
safeguarding social order, enable the party and government 
leaders at various levels to enhance the sense of responsibility 
for ensuring that the localities to which they belong should be 
safe and sound, enable the broad masses of the people to 
participate in the improvement of social order, actually form a 
pattern of making concerted efforts to improve social order, 
organize all social forces to make key improvements and solve 
prominent problems relating to social order, exert great efforts 
to improve the social order of rural areas, implement various 
measures for comprehensively improving social order, make better 
use of legal means to timely and legally regulate various 
economic and social relations, and ensure that the socialist 
market economy is smoothly operating on the orbit of the legal 
system. We should focus on opposing corruption and advocating 
administrative honesty to achieve the construction of the 
judicial, procuratorial, and court workers contingents; and 
provide a forceful organizational guarantee for achieving 
judicial, procuratorial, and court work in the new situation. 
  Responsible comrades of the municipal security bureau, the 
municipal people's procuratorate, the municipal higher people's 
court, and the municipal judicial bureau respectively made 
speeches on achieving 1994 judicial, procuratorial, and court 
work tasks. Present at the conference were responsible comrades 
of departments committees, offices, districts, counties, 
bureaus, and mass organizations, as well as responsible persons 
of the committees and departments for political science and law 
at the municipal, district, and county levels; security 
departments under various bureaus; and some large- and 
medium-sized enterprises.

  [Text] Tianjin, February 17 (XINHUA) -- A survey of 10 
Tianjin joint stock companies shows that they netted 320 million 
yuan in profit last year, an increase of 8.96 percent over the 
previous year. 
  Meanwhile, the 10 enterprises raised about 1 billion yuan 
last year for technical transformation and expansion of 
production. 
  A Tianjin government official said that the city started 
converting enterprises into joint stock companies in 1992. 
  Now the city has 58 standard joint stock companies and 
hundreds of partnership companies. 
  They include state enterprises in the manufacturing, 
commerce, communications and transportation, and real estate 
sectors. 
  Three of the 58 companies have gone public and 32 are 
liability limited companies. 
  Tianjin is one of the most important industrial bases in 
north China. The introduction of the joint stock system will 
help the enterprises to face the market, enhance their 
decision-making power and increase funds directed toward 
technological transformation and production. 
  This year, the city will select 30 others from its 100 
large- 
and medium-sized state enterprises to try the modern enterprise 
system.

  [Text] Tianjin, February 16 (XINHUA) -- Statistics for 
January have indicated that Tianjin, the largest industrial city 
in north China, is becoming an even greater focus for overseas 
investment. 
  In January, the city approved 223 foreign-funded 
enterprises. 
Promised investment recorded a 500 million U.S. dollar total, of 
which 300 million U.S. dollars is from abroad. 
  Deputy Mayor Ye Disheng attributed the city's charm to its 
comprehensive industrial system, convenient communications and 
above all, its 600,000-strong scientific and technological 
force, including undergraduates at nearly 100 institutions of 
higher learning in Beijing and Tianjin. 
  In addition to over 70 million U.S. dollars for the 
Chengtangzhuang heating and power plant from Ka Shing-li, a 
well-known Hong Kong tycoon, on the last day in 1993, there have 
been many projects established in the last month: 
  On January 3, Malaysia's Gold Lion group signed a contract 
with the city, with an investment of 4.5 billion yuan in such 
fields as auto manufacturing and housing renovation. 
  On January 5, a conglomerate from the Republic of Korea held 
a discussion with the local government on the feasibility of a 
chemical project worth 400 million U.S. dollars. 
  On January 10, Innovation International (H.K.) Ltd. decided 
to inject one billion yuan into a housing project, with another 
250 million yuan on a heating and power plant. 
  On January 18, Hong Kong's Kuop Group signed an agreement 
with the city's Hexi (the west bank of the Haihe River) area to 
build a commercial mansion. It also plans to build projects in 
the Tianjin development zone. 
  On January 20, Taiwan investors poured 600 million U.S. 
dollars into the Gangwan Industrial Park. 
  Meanwhile, over 60 inspection teams from countries such as 
the U.S., Germany, Italy, Japan and Singapore lined up to enter 
the city. 
  Average investment for each project stands at over two 
million U.S. dollars, double the investment scale last year. 
And there have been 15 projects funded with more than five 
million U.S. dollars each.

<F P=106> ["Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman on Management of </F>
Foreigners' Religious Activities in China" -- XINHUA headline] 
  [Text] Beijing, February 17 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman said here today that claims that the recently 
promulgated regulation on the management of foreigners' 
religious activities in China has limited links between Chinese 
and foreign religious people were totally groundless. 
  At a weekly press conference here this afternoon, the 
spokesman said China is a country that pays great attention to 
the rule by law. 
  He said the regulation fully shows that the Chinese 
Government respects the freedom of religious belief of 
foreigners in China and of Chinese citizens, protects their 
normal religious activities, and preserves normal friendly 
contacts and cultural and academic exchanges between foreign and 
Chinese people in the religious field. 
  Meanwhile, he said, the regulation also demonstrates the 
principles set forth in China's constitution that China's 
religious bodies and religious affairs will not be subjected to 
any foreign domination. 
  The spokesman said foreigners in China should abide by 
Chinese laws and should neither harm the country's public social 
interests nor interfere in its religious affairs. 
  When asked to confirm whether the Chinese Public Security 
Department had arrested foreign Christians, the spokesman said 
three American citizens and two citizens from Indonesia 
conducted illegal religious activities between February 9 and 
11, 1994, in Henan Province of China, thus violating the 
regulation on the maintenance of social order of the People's 
Republic of China and the regulation on the management of 
foreigners' religious activities in China. 
  On February 11, the local public security bureau, in 
accordance with Chinese laws, conducted an investigation, 
instructing and giving warnings to these people, and shortened 
the term of stay in China for one American citizen among them, 
the spokesman said. 
  These people acknowleged that they had violated Chinese 
laws, 
made guarantees that they would no longer conduct such 
activities and left for Hong Kong on the afternoon of February 
15, he said.

<F P=106> ["News analysis" by Wang Nan: "Corporate America Pins Hopes </F>
on `Salesman-in-Chief'"] 
  [Text] Washington, February 16 (XINHUA) -- When Saudi 
Arabia made clear its intention of replacing its current fleet 
of commercial airplanes, rushing to the offer were not just 
civil aircraft makers. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton, followed by French President 
Francois Mitterrand and British Prime Minister John Major, were 
all around appealing to King Fahd for better chances for their 
own countries. 
  Behind the heavy lobbying was the hot rivalry for survival 
prominently between American aircraft makers, Boeing and 
McDonnell Douglas, and Airbus Industries, owned by four European 
countries. 
  Like his counterparts abroad, Clinton, though busy with 
health care reform and crime fighting at home, still has a new 
role to play: the salesman-in-chief for corporate America. 
  In announcing Saudi Arabia's purchase of American planes 
worth nearly six billion U.S. dollars here today, Clinton made 
good on his promise to strive for more and fair trade 
opportunities for U.S. firms. 
  "We worked hard on this, and we will continue to work hard 
at 
home and abroad to help our people thrive in the global 
economy," Clinton said at a hastily arranged White House 
ceremony this morning. 
  Flanked by Frank Shrontz, chairman of Boeing company, and 
John McDonnell, chairman of McDonnell Douglas Corp., the 
President said he was proud to be called the salesman-in-chief 
of corporate America. 
  According to Commerce Secretary Ron Brown today, who visited 
Saudi Arabia twice late last year to discuss potential plane 
sales to Riyadh, President Clinton called King Fahd on the phone 
in person last year. 
  "I have talked with the President many times on this issue," 
Brown said. "He was very familiar with everything that we were 
doing." 
  In selling 50 airplanes to Saudi Arabia, the U.S. is 
expected 
to keep nearly 200,000 high-paying, high-tech jobs in the two 
companies, and in United Technologies Inc. and General Electric 
Co., makers of aircraft engines. 
  Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, the first and third largest 
aircraft makers, are competing with the European Airbus 
consortium, the producer of one in every four of the world's 
commercial airplanes. 
  In the Seattle-based Boeing company, commercial jetliner 
deliveries dropped from 440 in 1991 to 300 last year, while its 
profit margin -- the net income as a percentage of the total 
sales, was pared down from 5.3 percent to 4.6 percent. 
  The overall earning of the Long Beach, California-based 
McDonnell Douglas Corp. is up thanks to increasing demand for 
key military planes like C-17 transport aircraft and F-15 
fighters. But as far as commercial aircraft were concerned, the 
firm had more orders canceled than won in 1993. 
  The two companies, which have a combined workforce of 
150,000 
are still cutting hands. The total employment in U.S. civil 
aircraft industry stands at some 250,000, down nearly one third 
from the peak level in 1991. 
  The plight, observers noted, explains how dependent 
corporate 
America has become on foreign sales in the wake of defense 
conversion and their own fat cutting. 
  A year ago, President Clinton, in his first major foreign 
trade policy speech, pledged that his government would be more 
than aggressive in assisting American companies abroad in order 
to make them "compete, not retreat." 
  In the national export strategy unveiled late last year, the 
administration promised to help boost the exports of key 
industries like auto, telecommunications, petroleum, banking and 
insurance services. 
  The Commerce Department, meanwhile, is listing 10 countries 
as key emerging markets for American products and preparing 
specifically targeted export strategies. 
  According to government officials, every billion dollars of 
exports means 20,000 new jobs at home. The new deal with Saudi 
Arabia is 15 percent of the annual U.S. exports of commercial 
aircraft. 
  The administration is also eyeing the profitable phone 
markets in Saudi Arabia, which plans to put in 1.5 million more 
phone lines, willing to help AT&amp;T against Siemens of Germany 
in 
winning four billion dollars worth contracts. 
  "If there are two or three or four American companies 
competing against foreign competitors, we're going to support 
all of them," Secretary Brown said. "We're not going to choose 
among or between American companies."

<F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian Ambassador to China Anatoliy </F>
Plyushko by Nataliya Myasnikova in Beijing; date not given: 
"Wind From the East... What Will It Bring to Ukraine?"] 
  [Excerpt] [Myasnikova] What has been achieved since 
bilateral relations were established two years ago? 
  [Plyushko] China was one of the first countries to recognize 
Ukrainian independence, so we are now celebrating this modest 
anniversary. Although two years is a but a brief moment from 
the historical viewpoint, this has been a time of strenuous work 
in terms of bilateral relations. A great many things have been 
accomplished. During nine months of 1993, since the time I 
presented my credentials, 10 official Ukrainian delegations have 
visited China. Of course, bilateral relations are not defined 
by the number of delegations, but this still indicates their 
intensity. Every visit dealt with specific issues. About 20 
documents have been signed during those two years, which have 
established a legal treaty basis for our bilateral relations in 
various fields. 
  [Myasnikova] Anatoliy Dmytrovych, how would you 
describe relations between Ukraine, which is moving toward 
nonnuclear status, and China, a nuclear state? 
  [Plyushko] I have held numerous meetings and conversations 
with representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
other leading Chinese officials, during which we discussed 
China's attitude toward the Ukrainian Supreme Council's 
ratification of the START I treaty and the Lisbon Protocol. I 
will briefly outline China's stance on these issues. As early 
as 1964, when China started to acquire nuclear weapons, it 
pledged that it would use them neither first nor against any 
nonnuclear state or region. When we requested that the Chinese 
side grant us security guarantees if Ukraine assumed nonnuclear 
status, the PRC Government reaffirmed its position. At the same 
time, the Chinese side expressed understanding for Ukraine's 
standpoint on nuclear disarmament, for which we are very 
grateful. We would welcome China's participation, along with 
other nuclear states, in a multilateral treaty granting national 
security guarantees for Ukraine. 
  [Myasnikova] Nevertheless, China continues to test 
nuclear weapons... 
  [Plyushko] China points out that other nuclear states have 
conducted more nuclear tests, which are essential for improving 
nuclear weapons and maintaining them at a proper level. 
Fundamentally, China wants such weapons to be completely 
prohibited, which will eliminate the problem of nuclear tests. 
This has been stated by Chinese officials. 
  [Myasnikova] What is Ukraine's attitude toward Taiwan? 
  [Plyushko] For China, this is a very delicate issue when it 
comes to relations with any country. The position of the PRC is 
clear, adamant, and consistent: There is only one China, and 
Taiwan is an integral part of it. While building relations with 
other countries, China consistently tries to get its partners to 
recognize this standpoint. Ukraine also recognizes it. We 
pledged not to establish any form of official relations with 
Taiwan. 
  [Myasnikova] What about unofficial relations? 
  [Plyushko] Such relations are possible in the sphere of 
economic cooperation. It is no secret that Taiwan has a robust 
economic and financial potential, as well as huge foreign 
currency reserves. Many countries are therefore interested in 
developing trade with it. The Chinese Government understands 
this and allows certain forms of cooperation, however only on a 
nongovernmental level -- at the level of companies and 
businesses. 
  [Myasnikova] Ukraine's independence has led to 
profound economic problems. Even though our government needs 
other countries' help, it has been refusing Chinese aid for more 
than a year. Why is the Joint Intergovernment Commission for 
Trade and Economic Cooperation not operating? 
  [Plyushko] It is always hard to establish a new state even 
under the most ideal conditions, both foreign and domestic. Our 
situation is even further complicated by inconsistency in 
implementing the economic reform program. A certain role was 
played by the breaking off of old economic ties, which 
undermined our economy. There are also objective reasons -- the 
lack of know-how in trading with other countries and offering 
the world what we have. Today, at the current stage, we cannot 
manage without foreign help. We need equal and mutually 
beneficial cooperation with other countries. We have many 
products we could offer to the world, and even developed 
countries are interested in those products, not to mention 
developing ones. In this regard, the prospects for our economic 
cooperation with China are very, very great. 
  Positive changes have already taken place over the last 
year. 
Whereas trade between Ukraine and China totaled $220 million in 
1992, this figure doubled in 1993. Although I do not have the 
final figure for trade between our countries in 1993, according 
to specialists, it should have reached $500 million. This is 
encouraging, but taking into account the capabilities of our 
countries, this is not a great deal. 
  During President Kravchuk's visit to China in October and 
November 1992, a number of documents were signed, including some 
on trade and economic relations, in particular an agreement 
establishing the Joint Intergovernment Commission for Trade and 
Economic Cooperation. This commission should become a 
coordinating and controlling body that will elevate our trade 
and economic relations to a new level. 
  The commission was difficult to establish, given that this 
was a time of constant changes in the Ukrainian Cabinet of 
Ministers and the Ministry of External Economic Relations. 
Finally, the members of the Ukrainian section of the 
commission, headed by Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov, 
were approved. Then a problem appeared on the Chinese side, 
which had a different attitude toward the establishment of the 
commission, considering it to be a working body that should be 
headed by people not below the level of minister of external 
economic relations. Negotiations on this issue are currently 
continuing, and there is hope that the first meeting of the 
commission will be held in January or February. 
  [Myasnikova] What will change when it begins to 
operate? 
  [Plyushko] The commission is to concentrate on trade and 
economic activities. Thus far, we do not have a mechanism for 
resolving such issues at the state level. Cooperation with 
China may become very beneficial for Ukraine. This basically 
concerns the PRC's experience in conducting economic reforms, 
which were introduced in 1978 and shook the whole world. 
China's GDP grows on average at a stable rate of 8-9 percent 
per year. In 1992 it increased 12.8 percent, and in 1993 -- 13 
percent, according to preliminary assessments. 
  China's latest economic successes cannot but draw the 
attention of the international community, and we can see today 
that Western countries are modifying their trade and economic 
policies, relations, and priorities. For its part, Ukraine 
possesses a sound industrial potential. We have certain 
world-standard technologies that China and other countries need. 
Few countries have experience in such fields as overall oil and 
gas pipeline planning, superhard materials, monocrystals, or 
welding equipment. However, we do not know much about the 
Chinese market, and we have conducted virtually no research 
whatsoever on Chinese needs or import requirements. One of the 
tasks of our embassy is to fill this gap. Moreover, we should 
help businessmen find beneficial partners. For the time being, 
it is hard to do this. Our numbers are limited (seven diplomats 
including the ambassador), and the important area of trade and 
economic relations is handled by only two officials who are 
physically unable to cope with the volume of work. By 
comparison, I can say that the trade mission attached to the 
Russian Embassy in Beijing employs about 100 professionals who 
help Russian enterprises establish cooperation with China. 
  [Myasnikova] Will Ukraine establish a trade mission? 
  [Plyushko] So far, it has been decided to open Ukrainian 
trade missions only in certain countries, first of all, in 
Europe. However, such a decision should also be adopted 
regarding China. We already have a trade surplus in relations 
with this country: In 1992, exports amounted to 60.5 percent, 
and imports to 39.5 percent. 
  [Myasnikova] What is the situation with the 
50-million-yuan interest-free commodity credit that has not been 
used by Ukraine for a year? 
  [Plyushko] Indeed, it has been a year since President 
Kravchuk signed the agreement for China to grant credit to 
Ukraine. Of course, it is bewildering why we do not take what 
they are offering. However, there are certain problems. China 
offers us goods in which we are not particularly interested. 
The point is to choose goods that Ukraine really needs. The 
conditions are tough. This does not mean that they give us 50 
million yuans and we can buy everything we want from other 
countries. The conditions are that the commodities must be 
bought in China. Realizing this obstacle, the Chinese side 
proposed slightly changing the form of the credit. During the 
September 1993 visit to Kiev by Vice Premier Qian Qichen, the 
Chinese side proposed allocating this sum for the construction 
or reconstruction of one or several Ukrainian enterprises, 
evaluating the equipment requirements, and purchasing it in 
China with the loan. This option is currently being evaluated.

<F P=106> [Article by Chen Tean (7115 3676 1344): "The `Three-Circle </F>
Diplomacy' of the Major Government is Facing a Challenge"--A 
Change in Britain's Role in World Affairs"] 
  [Text] What is Britain's position in the drastically 
changing world of today and what role is Britain playing? This 
has been a topic of discussion among the British people 
recently. Although the Britain of today cannot be compared with 
that of the past, the Major government is still doing its utmost 
to continue pursuing "three-circle diplomacy," that is, 
conducting activities within the three links of developing the 
Western European Union, maintaining the special relationship 
between Britain and the United States, and preserving the 
British Commonwealth, as proposed by Winston Churchill and first 
put into practice by Foreign Secretary Earnest Belvin. If we 
say that Churchill's pursuit of "three-circle diplomacy" was 
effected through a series of measures, we can also see that the 
times and situations have changed, and the Major government 
seems unable to pursue "three-circle diplomacy" as it wishes and 
finds it difficult to go any further. 
  In developing its relationship with Europe, Britain seems to 
be hesitating and marking time. Although Prime Minister Major 
repeatedly claimed to place Britain in the "heart of Europe," it 
has always been regarded by the European Union as a half-hearted 
member. Since the end of World War II, Britain has taken a 
position toward European union which is different from most 
countries on the European Continent. With regard to the goals 
and orientation of building Europe, the mainstream faction of 
most governments of the EC members -- including France, Germany, 
and so on -- represented by Jean Monnet and Delors, has taken 
the building of an integrated European economic and political 
entity or a supranational European union as a basic goal, since 
the early years of European unification movement until the 
subsequent effort to build an integrated European community. 
Britain did not favor this proposition, however, and still has 
reservations on the goal of developing the EC into a union as 
proposed by the Maastricht Treaty. With regard to the presence 
of the United States in Europe, it maintains that the United 
States should remain in Europe to balance the strength there, 
but France and Germany hold that "Europe belongs to the 
Europeans." The United States supported the suggestion that 
Germany be admitted as an additional permanent member of the UN 
Security Council early last year, but Britain and France have 
reservations on this issue. With regard to the war flames that 
are spreading in the former Yugoslav regions, Britain, France, 
and Germany all have considerations of their own. 
  The "special relationship between Britain and the United 
States," which has been maintained for many years, is not so 
"special" now. Before the gunsmoke of World War II had lifted, 
former British Prime Minister Churchill proposed establishing a 
"special British-U.S. relationship" in his speech in Fulton in 
the United States, hoping to use the United States to prop up 
its appearance of "might." During the Cold War period, the 
actions of the Western alliance were generally determined by 
unanimous agreement between the two countries. However, the two 
special allies have harbored ill feelings toward one another for 
some time recently. Prior to Christmas in 1992, President-elect 
Clinton made an excuse to avoid meeting the British prime 
minister who was visiting the United States at that time, which 
cast a dark shadow over British-U.S. relations. In February of 
the next year when Major once again visited the United States, 
he failed to repair the "special relationship," and differences 
between the two sides became even more prominent--they stuck to 
their own arguments on the issue of trade talks between Europe 
and the United States, had acute differences in their views on 
airdropping materials in Bosnia- Herzegovina, and engaged in a 
battle of words on the issue of Northern Ireland. The United 
States denounced British actions in Northern Ireland as 
"violations of human rights," and Britain criticized the U.S. 
intention to send a peace corps to inspect North Ireland as 
"interference in its internal affairs." It appears that 
people's views on the "special relationship" have changed under 
the situation of increasing friction and conflicts between the 
two sides economically and politically, although both consider 
it necessary to maintain such a "special relationship." 
  Britain has made a comprehensive effort to maintain the 
increasingly weak British Commonwealth. With each member of the 
Commonwealth currently going its own way, however, the decisions 
made by the conference are not binding on the member countries. 
When the conference of the British Commonwealth was held in 
Cyprus last year, the newspapers in the host country stated that 
the "themes of the conference are irrelevant and pointless," and 
that the British Commonwealth was "no longer a major force in 
international politics." In Australia, an irresistible wave of 
republican sentiment is surging forward, and Australian Prime 
Minister Keating has repeatedly proposed that Australia should 
appear in the international arena as an "image of independence," 
should become a republic before the year 2000, and should change 
its national flag, which is similar in design to the British 
ensign, in due time. 
  There are profound root causes for the challenges that the 
British "three-circle diplomacy" is facing. 
  Britain was once very glorious, but this glory has become 
history. Economic statistics show that British industry has 
been in an accelerated decline, and its proportion in 
international manufacturing production, trade, and GNP have 
fallen sharply. Over the past few years, the country has been 
bogged down in a serious economic recession and so far has 
lacked the strength to recover. Just as the British magazine the 
ECONOMIST has stated, "Britain's real significance has been on 
the wane to a considerable extent." Economic reality has made 
people realize that "its position of strength of the past is 
gone forever." 
  The radical changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, 
the reunification of Germany, and the conclusion of the Cold War 
have fundamentally changed the international environment which 
Britain has relied upon to maneuver and carry out its foreign 
policies. First, the end of the Cold War noticeably weakened the 
British position and influence. Being a victorious nation in 
World War II and the second largest economic power in the 
capitalist world in early post-war years, and backed up by the 
"special British-U.S. relationship," Britain played an important 
role in the formation and development of the international 
political and economic order after World War II. With the lapse 
of the Cold War era, however, the importance of the military 
factor in the relations of the Western alliance have declined, 
while that of economic factors has risen remarkably. Thus, its 
political superiority -- based on its military capability and 
its role in the defense of the West -- has been deteriorating 
imperceptibly. Moreover, united Germany has grown to be the 
number one economic power in Europe and occupies an increasingly 
important position of leadership in the EC with every passing 
day. As a result, in foreign affairs the United States is 
leaning more toward Germany as the days go by. Second, U.S. 
foreign policy specialists maintain that the "future of the 
world lies in Asia." Asia's position in the U.S. global 
strategy has risen somewhat, and the relationship between the 
United States and the Western European countries, including 
Britain, is facing new readjustments. 
  Although Britain's national strength is far from what it was 
in the past, the British Government has not redefined its 
position and policy goals according to the new international 
pattern. Conversely, it has continued to pursue Churchill's 
"three-circle diplomacy." This is a tough problem for British 
diplomacy. Therefore, the British press maintains that Britain's 
foreign policy goals are in urgent need of further 
readjustment." A senior British Government official also said a 
short time ago that Britain will lose its international 
influence -- which it still possesses -- unless it reevaluates 
its foreign policy goals and refrains from sticking its nose in 
everybody's business.

<F P=106> [News conference held by Taiwan President Li Teng-hui with </F>
unidentified correspondents at Taoyuan Chiang Kai-shek 
International Airport on 16 February] 
  [Summary From Poor Reception] In his opening speech, 
President Li Teng-hui says the main purpose of his informal 
visit was to gain a true understanding of the international 
situation, in particular the international economic situation 
following the end of the Cold War. The Republic of China [ROC] 
must further strengthen regional economic cooperation with other 
countries, and this is the true way to promote China's economy 
to a new level of development. Therefore, he believes it 
necessary to spend his holidays in relevant countries with which 
the ROC has no diplomatic relations, discussing regional 
economic cooperation. Li adds: "The visit produced fairly good 
results. I think it is very important for establishing 
all-directional economic cooperation in Asia in the future." Li 
goes on to state that he learned by his visit that the respect 
shown by these three countries toward the Republic of China in 
Taiwan is "more than we can imagine at home." He also thanks 
the leaders of the three countries for their hospitality during 
his visit. The president expresses regret over not being able 
to visit the overseas Chinese in these countries, saying he had 
to "respect the host countries' arrangements." Li states that 
"China's further development must be separated from ideology," 
pointing out the orientation -- "peace, cooperation, and 
prosperity" -- for efforts to be made. Li concludes: "We 
helped the mainland achieve development just like we helped 
Southeast Asia achieve progress and development. We expect to 
use Taiwan's experience to help the entire Asian region achieve 
progress and development." 
  Commenting on a Central News Agency reporter's question 
regarding the president's emphasis on "pragmatic diplomacy," 
letting other countries know about the ROC's existence, and on a 
reasonable position within the international community, 
President Li replies that the countries he visited adopted a 
very pragmatic attitude to discussing Communist China's protest. 
He says they know the ROC is a peace-loving country, and wish 
to make friends with it. He calls for patience and long-term 
efforts in this regard. 
  In response to a question on ideology raised by a reporter 
from the Taiwan Television Enterprise, Ltd., President Li 
Teng-hui urges all Chinese to understand that the ROC must 
develop, and that the ROC is a state separate from China. He 
asks people not to consider his "unofficial visit" as "creating 
one China, one Taiwan, or two China's." "Quite obviously, that 
is impossible," he concludes. 
  A reporter for the Broadcasting Corporation of China asks if 
Li has any plans for a second trip abroad in the same informal 
manner following his great success in the Southeast Asia visit 
he just concluded. President Li replies: "I will visit 
countries with which we have official diplomatic relations, and 
I will visit countries with which we have unofficial relations." 
He says it is still too early to say at the moment, but the 
press will learn about such plans in due course once all 
preparations are completed. 
  A reporter for TZU LI WAN PAO quotes the memoirs of Hsu 
Chia-t'un [Xu Jiatun], former director of the Hong Kong Branch 
of the NEW CHINA [XINHUA] NEWS AGENCY, as saying the PRC 
leadership considers Taiwan's vigorous efforts to occupy 
international space as aimed at gaining independence in a 
disguised form, and the PRC does not agree. The attitude of the 
Chinese Communist leadership will certainly affect the 
president's informal visit as well as regional political and 
economic activities, the reporter adds. He asks President Li if 
the latter has any policy or countermeasures against such an 
attitude. 
  In his response, President Li questions the reliability of 
Hsu Chia-t'un's remarks. "It is very hard to judge future 
trends on the mainland by his remarks," Li says. 
  Responding to a question by a CHUNG YANG JIH PAO reporter on 
regional economic cooperation, President Li says he discussed 
the establishment of free economic zones in the Philippines and 
rural construction in Indonesia, and the ROC's experiences in 
promoting development on Taiwan over the past few decades is 
very valuable to these countries. 
  A reporter from LIEN HO PAO asks Li about protests from 
Communist China against his informal visit. President Li says 
every country in the world is "very practical" and attaches 
importance to its own economic development. He urges people not 
to treat the issue as "very serious." Li says: "The ROC is a 
mature country. I do not think it is necessary for us to flinch 
on account of such a minor issue as an immature statement." 
  In response to a question by a TAIWAN JIH PAO reporter on 
the 
ROC's overseas investments, President Li states the ROC still 
needs to rely on foreign trade to promote economic development 
as it is a country without natural resources. He points out 
that there is no so-called southern or western policy, and the 
ROC must work in all directions so long as they are conducive to 
further development. He adds: "We want to invest in the 
mainland, Indonesia, and the Philippines. All these investment 
projects are different from each other." Li stresses: "We must 
understand the ROC wants to develop trade. It is the most 
important factor for economic development. If we want to 
increase the trade volume, we must transfer our capital, which 
is the most favorable condition enjoyed by the ROC now, to all 
relevant countries. After our capital is transferred, the 
volume of our trade will naturally increase." 
  A reporter asks President Li for his thoughts about the 
trip. 
President Li replies that during his visits to the Philippines 
and Indonesia, local officials called him Doctor Li or Professor 
Li. The president notes: "The main reason is quite simple. 
Whether they are ministers or business leaders, they know Li 
Teng-hui accomplished many things in the academic field or in 
Taiwan's agricultural development, and all this proved very 
successful." Li then talks about how he sent two of his books 
to a foreign leader, saying: "To me, it is very significant 
that other people respect my past works in the academic field 
and in other areas. It is very pleasant if one can help his 
country by his personal achievements or by what he has done. 
[words indistinct] I am already at this age; the fire from this 
candle will burn for the people of my country and for this 
region so they can live in stability and so their standard of 
living can improve. I think this is very [?good]. Thank you." 
  A reporter from CHUNG HWA JIH PAO questions President Li 
about what is the biggest achievement of his informal visits, 
and how he feels at the moment. 
  President Li responds: "It is not good for me to appraise my 
own performance, for no one should appraise himself. However, I 
am very happy." He continues on to say: "I think all these 
problems are [words indistinct]. Currently the leaders of all 
countries have a common view. What is this common view? It is 
that politics should be democratic, should be free and 
democratic [words indistinct]. The economy should be a 
market-based free economy. No one [words indistinct] except 
leaders of a few socialist countries [words indistinct]. Even 
they are now inclined toward a free economy. What does this 
mean? It means world leaders have this common view, and this 
enables them to communicate easily with each other. Any 
problems between countries can be solved right away if leaders 
of those countries concerned sit down and talk. I have always 
thought there would not be any world wars in the future, maybe 
only minor conflicts because people have common views, and there 
would not be differences between them [as heard]. Will the 
civil war in Yugoslavia spread to the entire world? I don't 
think it will. World War I broke out there, but now [words 
indistinct]. Thus I hope everyone knows that almost all world 
leaders have common views. [passage indistinct] Whether it is 
the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Japan, I think 
[words indistinct]. Like the U.S. President, Japanese prime 
minister, British prime minister, and French president [words 
indistinct]. Although Taiwan is very small, [words indistinct]." 
  A reporter asks Li about Taiwan's investment plans in ASEAN 
countries. President Li answers: "Now it is between us and the 
Philippines, not Indonesia." He then explains Taiwan's plans to 
invest in and cooperate with Indonesia, Thailand, and the 
Philippines, saying: "Especially Indonesia, because Indonesia 
is the largest country and has many rural problems. Actually, I 
made a very sketchy proposal there and talked with them. I 
think we should review this problem at home. Many experiences 
in Taiwan's rural construction will be very helpful to them. We 
took a special trip to see how they harvest rice, how their 
irrigation system works, and what their rural organization are 
like. These areas are where we can help them. The trip helped 
us understand the situation." 
  When asked about the investment climate in the Philippines 
and Indonesia, and if improving the domestic investment climate 
is more important then helping local businessmen invest in 
foreign countries, President Li responds: "Improving the 
domestic investment climate is one thing, and investing in 
foreign countries is another. There is no competition between 
the two. The only competition may be on which side we should 
spend more money." He then explains why Taiwan should invest in 
Indonesia, saying: "How can the ROC develop without energy? 
Investing in Indonesia is necessary to the country's long-term 
interests. We cannot express the entire thing just by saying 
making investment and encouraging our businessmen to establish 
small factories there. I don't think that is the way." 
  Answering a reporter's question about the ROC's foreign and 
PRC policies, Li Teng-hui says: "Our mainland policy and our 
foreign policy can be characterized by what we now call 
pragmatic diplomacy. As far as the mainland is concerned, we 
are working towards promoting mutual trust between the two 
sides." Li continues: "In my view, our talks with the mainland 
and our relations with it on many other issues need not be 
conducted in conjunction with ideological matters. The mainland 
should also understand this. We need not take our ideology into 
consideration and think that only our ideology is the best." As 
Li concludes: "I said a while ago we should work for peace, 
progress, and prosperity. These are the objectives the entire 
world is looking for. Even the Chinese Communist Party wants 
these things. This being the case, there should not be 
conflicts between our foreign and mainland policies. Diplomacy 
should be described as a very important piece of our mainland 
policy. 
  "During my visit to the three Southeast Asian nations, the 
issue about forming a collective Asian security system was not 
discussed. The reason why this issue was not discussed is we 
cannot simply ask people who are still strangers to become our 
friends and fight alongside us. If others misunderstand us, the 
outcome would be unthinkable. So we should cooperate first in 
the economic field." The president adds that he feels Taiwan 
should proceed step by step. "I had the economy in mind when I 
proposed the establishment of a collective Asian security 
system." Li concludes: "I don't think we should consider 
military cooperation as an important base." 
  Li states his impression about the leaders of the three 
countries he visited was that they, including the Thai king, are 
very sagacious. "They have a profound understanding of the 
issues concerning this region." Li cites as an example 
Indonesian President Suharto. He has been president for 25 
years, but does not enjoy life in his villas. He understands 
many issues thoroughly, including small issues. "These leaders 
know very clearly the situation with the ROC. This is the case 
with President Ramos of the Philippines as well as the Thai 
King." As Li states: "World leaders today do not simply manage 
the affairs of their own countries; they are very attentive to 
their relations with other countries and the situations in those 
countries. They realize the strengths of the Republic of China 
[words indistinct]. I admire them greatly. My talks with them 
were very congenial. They understood what I said, and I 
understand what they said." 
  Li says that among world leaders, Chinese Communist leaders 
are the most stubborn. "It is quite impossible to ask the 
Chinese Communists to renounce the concept of one country, two 
systems." 
  The president states that he deeply feels Taiwan should work 
even harder. "We should not evaluate ourselves too highly. We 
should not think we can fool around and do things which are 
improper, thinking we have several billions of dollars in our 
hands. We should do something about our cultural and ethical 
conduct so people will respect us in these areas. Maybe this is 
more important. 
  "I did not invite the Thai King to visit. I do not know in 
what way the invitation should be extended. But I did 
officially invite the other two leaders to visit." 
  Hong Kong MING PAO reporter Lai Hsiu-ju asks: "Many 
Southeast 
Asian nations still hold conflicting views on the sovereignty 
over the South China Sea. Do you think Taiwan's southern policy 
can assist those countries in dealing peacefully with the 
sensitive sovereignty issue, and do you think it possible for 
countries in that part of the world to work together in 
exploring the resources there?" 
  Li Teng-hui responds: "I share your view. But I just cannot 
tell friends I meet for the first time what we should do. Is it 
not better that we talk once we have met two or three times? 
So, as I said a while ago about the collective security system, 
I tried my best not to discuss sensitive issues like that when 
the time available was so limited, otherwise people might be 
scared to death by me and refuse to see me in the future." Li 
says that after they have met two or three times, he will 
certainly speak out. 
  An ECONOMIC DAILY reporter asks Li to comment on the 
possibility of cooperation between the Republic of China and 
Indonesia in the aerospace industry. Li Teng-hui replies: "I 
asked a lot of questions when I visited the aircraft plant in 
Bandung. I asked a lot of questions about the plant's 
operations, management, and sales. But I did not suggest 
cooperation. Why? I know our situation, what we should do, and 
our level of development. The plant did not mention their 
problems, but I understood. So bilateral cooperation is 
impossible. The planes it produces are for commercial use. 
Because Indonesia has over 17,000 islands, planes are badly 
needed for transportation. The plant's monthly output of planes 
is about 270. I said something ridiculous: Buying planes is 
different from buying cars. They understand what I said. Plane 
purchases require a lot of money. Where will the money come 
from? Without money or loans, how are you going to pay? 
Problems like these are many." 
  On whether his unofficial summits with leaders on the 
Southeast Asian trip might help the ROC's UN membership, Li 
Teng-hui says: "I think if the road to the United Nations is 
100-km long, we have covered only one meter. So we have to 
continue to work hard. This is not easy. We must work hard so 
other countries will understand better that the United Nations 
will not get anything from us if we are not a member, and then 
all countries, including large countries, will help us. This is 
the direction toward which we should work hard."

<F P=106> [Article by Li Wenhong (2621 2429 3163) and Zhao Zhensheng </F>
(6392 2182 5116): "The Premier Invites an Ox Farm `Commander' 
To be His Guest at Zhongnanhai"] 
  [Text] The heart of the people's premier and those of the 
people beat as one. 
  It happened on 26 January, that is mid-December in the lunar 
calendar. Premier Li Peng's residence in Zhongnanhai was filled 
with a warm and joyous atmosphere. 
  "We express our thanks for the premier's concern, and extend 
our New Year's greetings to the premier on behalf of Sanhe's 
400,000 people!" "Thank you! You're welcome. I extend my New 
Year's greetings to Sanhe's people, too!" 
  That was an unforgettable moment. At the invitation of 
Premier Li Peng, Li Fucheng [2621 4395 2052], manager of Fucheng 
Ox Farm Group Company, who has the reputation of being the 
"Commander of the Ox Farm Business in Eastern Beijing," and 
Sanhe Mayor Liu Xueku [0491 1331 1655] arrived at the premier's 
house as his guests at 1030 that day. 
  A year before, on 22 January 1993, that is New Year's Eve on 
the lunar calendar, Premier Li Peng braved the bitter cold and 
made a special trip to Sanhe's Li Fucheng Ox Farm on an 
inspection tour to extend New Year's greetings to the peasants, 
and wrote an inscription calling for "developing the ox farm 
business in a big way, utilizing crop stalks as fodder, with cow 
dung returned to the field to promote a sound cycle of 
agriculture." Now, a year had passed. How had Sanhe developed? 
The premier showed great concern about that. 
  Thrilled, Li Fucheng and Liu Xueku reported to the premier: 
Over the past year, 30 million yuan had been invested, and the 
semi-mechanization transformation of the ox farm, a 
slaughterhouse with a processing capacity of 70,000 head per 
year, a fodder-processing factory with an annual output of 
40,000 tonnes, and a winery with an annual output of 2,000 
tonnes of liquor and 10,000 tonnes of distillers' grains had 
been completed one after another. At the same time, a 
beef-marketing department had been set up in Beijing. The 
Fucheng Ox Farm had already expanded into the Fucheng Ox Farm 
Group Company; its fixed assets had grown from the original 12 
million to 40 million yuan, and it had became an ox farm group 
company of the largest scale across China. At the same time, 
five branches of the ox farm had been newly built in Chengde and 
other places. The number of oxen on hand and the number 
slaughtered had increased from 2,000 and 5,000 head respectively 
in 1992 to 4,500 and 12,000 head respectively, both doubling. 
In addition, the group company had brought along l50 peasant 
households to go in for ox farming, and their output had also 
increased by 50 percent over 1992. 
  In accordance with the premier's instruction, Sanhe regarded 
the Fucheng Group as the locomotive and developed ox farming in 
a big way. In 1993, the number of oxen bred was 68,000 head, 
and 170,000 tonnes of crop stalks were consumed, accounting for 
90 percent of the volume of stalks of the whole city; 476,000 
tonnes of cow dung were produced, with the area of farmland thus 
fertilized expanded; and consequently the annual grain output 
increased by some 10,000 tonnes, a record high.... 
  Hearing this, the premier was very happy, and said: "The 
peasants will become well-off on the strength of agriculture, 
and Li Fucheng is precisely a typical example of a peasant 
becoming rich through agriculture." 
  The topic now centered on intensive processing in ox 
farming. 
The premier said: "With greater numbers of oxen, it is 
imperative to keep an eye on the market. To develop the 
economy, nothing can be separated from the market. In 
slaughtering oxen, our beef may enter Beijing's large hotels and 
restaurants as a substitute for imports; cowhide involves 
intensive processing to turn out leather, which can be 
manufactured into leather coats, luggage and other things." 
  Comrade Zhu Lin threw in a few words when she heard that the 
Fucheng Group had already drawn up a plan to start a tannery in 
the following year, saying: "Should you start a tannery, it 
must turn out high grade leather; advanced equipment must be 
imported for that purpose." 
  Upon hearing that Sanhe had already changed from a county to 
a city, and entered the ranks of the 100 most advanced cities in 
China, the premier said: "I knew it; my congratulations. What 
is your position in the list?" 
  "Seventy-eighth," Liu Xueku answered. 
  "You should work harder. I hope that you will mount a higher 
plane in the new year." The premier encouraged them and pinned 
high hopes on them with deep feeling. 
  The premier also asked about the conditions of Sanhe's 
industry, township and town enterprises, and development zone, 
and cordially said: "You are very close to Beijing, and the 
city enjoys very special geographical advantages. You should do 
a very good job of running the development zone. You should 
grow a variety of vegetables to enrich Beijing's marketplace!" 
  Time flew; soon an hour or so had passed. Li Fucheng and Liu 
Xueku could hardly tear themselves away when they said goodbye 
to Premier Li Peng and Comrade Zhu Lin, and they hoped the 
premier would take care. The premier was in very good spirits; 
he stood up and said: "I'm in pretty good shape! Thank you! 
Come, let's have a picture taken together." The premier held 
Li Fucheng with one hand, and Liu Xueku with the other. Thus a 
staff member aimed his camera and recorded this precious 
moment...

"Implementation of Plan To Change Specialized Banks Into 
Commercial Banks Is Postponed"] 
  [Text] The economic reform package in China has not been 
smooth. Due to the grim economic situation, some plans for 
financial reform, such as changing state-run specialized banks 
into commercial banks, have had to be postponed. 
  According to informed sources in Beijing, the reform to 
unify 
the yuan exchange rate announced by the central government this 
year has caused the yuan to depreciate by 50 percent in a hidden 
form, and the negative effect of this measure is that it has 
greatly stimulated inflation, which was already very serious in 
China. As a result, persons in economic circles in China have 
drastically changed their views on China's economic situation 
this year; among these, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji's think tank 
also generally holds that inflation in China is the most 
important problem at this time. 
  Zhu Rongji pointed out at an internal meeting last month 
that, in light of this situation, this year, China must strictly 
control the volume of currency issued; he also demanded that 
various localities strictly control the scale of credit within 
their plans and should refrain from exceeding them by a single 
cent. 
  Due to the grim economic situation, some reform measures 
have 
had to be postponed. Zhu Rongji pointed out that financial 
reform must be slowed down, and while the People's Bank of China 
can still change to the status and function of a central bank 
according to schedule, changing state-run specialized banks into 
commercial banks must be slowed down, and he pointed out that 
this was a long-term task. 
  According to information, this decision by Zhu Rongji is 
mainly based on two reasons: first, due to the high inflation 
rate, China must control the volume of currency issued; however, 
other regulatory and control measures are very limited at this 
time, so China can only tighten the money supply through 
controlling bank credit. Therefore, for a long period to come, 
controls over the scale of credit issuance by China's banks 
cannot change, while the commercialization of specialized banks 
can hardly be promoted. 
  In addition, state-owned enterprises have been slow in 
changing their operational mechanisms, nor can they really take 
sole responsibility for profits and losses. Therefore, 
specialized banks, which are there to provide funds to 
state-owned enterprises, cannot handle their deposits and loans 
for purely commercial reasons; as a result, if reform of 
state-owned enterprises cannot provide specialized banks with an 
appropriate environment, specialized banks cannot really change 
into commercial banks. 
  According to information, one of the most important measures 
to support the unification of the yuan exchange rate -- work to 
build an exchange rate transaction system among the banks -- has 
not been smoothly prepared. An informed source pointed out that 
because various departments are still arguing on the concrete 
plan for an interbank transaction system, it is not optimistic 
that the original plan can be implemented on 1 April this year. 
  In addition, a relevant person disclosed that, at present, 
"debt chains" among state-run enterprises throughout the country 
have already swollen rapidly to nearly 100 billion yuan, and 
some persons hold that these debt chains are largely the result 
of the tightening of the money supply which began last July when 
the central government carried out macroregulation and control.

  [Text] In 1993, Beijing's courts at all levels tried and 
concluded over 70,000 criminal, civil, economic, and 
administrative cases, of which about 10.5 percent, more than 
7,400 cases, were criminal cases concluded in the first trial; 
about 55.6 percent, more than 38,000 cases, were civil cases; 
and about 11.1 percent, more than 7,900 cases, were cases on 
economic disputes. 
  In coordination with the anticorruption struggle, courts at 
all levels in the municipality meted out sentences to over 2,700 
criminals for embezzlement, taking bribes, and misuse of public 
funds, of whom over 1,000 were sentenced to more than five years 
of imprisonment, life imprisonment, or death. 
  In the meantime, Beijing's courts at all levels persisted in 
promptly and strictly cracking down on criminal elements that 
seriously endangered public security. Over 4,900 such criminals 
were sentenced, including 160-odd murderers, 1,000-odd robbers, 
and 560-odd rapists. The courts at all levels also held over 
100 rallies to pronounce sentences, thus maintaining the 
momentum of the strict crackdown activities and effectively 
frightening criminals. 
  In trying economic cases, courts at all levels in the 
municipality received over 7,000 cases on economic disputes in 
1993, up 27.9 percent from the previous year, and concluded over 
6,900 of them. Money involved in these disputes totaled 1.69 
billion yuan, up 122.4 percent.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Beijing Adopts Five Measures for </F>
Reforming Foreign Economic Relations and Trade"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 16 Feb (LIEN HO PAO)--To speed up the 
reform of the foreign economic relations and trade structure and 
to speed up the pace of using foreign capital, Beijing 
Municipality has formulated five measures for reforming foreign 
economic relations and trade this year: 
  1. Improve the investment environment and guide the 
direction of foreign investment. The following things are to be 
done in this area. The first thing is to formulate short-term 
and medium-term plans for using foreign capital, to strengthen 
the construction of urban infrastructure, to strengthen 
legislation of economic laws involving foreigners, to create 
conditions for treating foreign-invested enterprises like those 
run by local people, and to improve services for using foreign 
capital. The second thing is to guide foreign businessmen to 
focus their investment in infrastructure, basic industries, 
high-technology and new-technology industries, and the technical 
transformation of old enterprises, to encourage running 
export-oriented enterprises, and to run Sino-foreign joint 
ventures of railways, expressways, and power plants. The third 
thing is to absorb investment of transnational and well-known 
corporations. The fourth thing is to explore new forms of using 
foreign capital. Infrastructure projects are to try to follow 
the building-operation-transfer process in using foreign 
capital. The Beijing International Industry Consultancy 
Holdings Corporation is to be established to invite tenders and 
to introduce foreign capital. Listed share-holding enterprises 
are to be encouraged to issue B shares if conditions are 
available and the financial institutions concerned are to be 
encouraged to issue bonds abroad. The fifth is to use foreign 
capital to develop commerce and to strive to increase the number 
of projects selected for experimentation; to explore how to use 
foreign capital in monetary affairs, insurance, and financial 
companies; to attract major foreign corporations with powerful 
strength to make investment in real estate and to use foreign 
capital to develop tourism; to make use of foreign capital to 
set up professional and service organizations for consultancy, 
information, quality accreditation, and professional appraisal; 
and to run accounting, auditing, and law office joint ventures 
on a trial basis. 
  2. Deepen foreign trade reform, change the mechanism of 
enterprises, and move toward the modern enterprise system. 
State-owned enterprises for foreign economic relations and 
trade are to be reorganized according to the modern enterprise 
system. A municipal import, export, credit, trust and 
investment corporation is to be set up to manage and operate the 
state assets of economic and trade enterprises of the whole 
municipality and to ensure that the value of state assets is 
maintained. The work of projects selected for experiments on 
the system of listing shares of garment import and export 
companies is to be grasped firmly. In this year, one third of 
the foreign trade enterprises are to carry out reform and to 
institute the share-holding system, the limited liability 
company system, and the share-holding cooperation system. 
Restrictions on ownership are to be removed and a new pattern 
of foreign trade which takes state-owned foreign trade 
enterprises as the main body and incorporates the common 
development of various forms of ownership is to be formed 
gradually. Restrictions on the scale of operation are to be 
removed; the division of work according to specialities in the 
management of export commodities is to be abolished; and 
diversified management is to be extensively carried out, while 
import and export activities remain the major business. 
Finally, various kinds of large groups for foreign economic 
relations and trade are to be organized. 
  3. Develop resources to earn foreign exchange and change the 
structure for swapping foreign exchange. Barter trade is to be 
expanded; trade in technology is to be promoted; and trade in 
the service industry is to be developed with great efforts. 
  4. Develop overseas enterprises. Large enterprises and 
large groups are to be encouraged to develop their businesses 
abroad, and several influential transnational corporations are 
to be set up. 
  5. Carry out organizational reform with a view to 
strengthening macro regulation and control.

  [Text] Geneva, February 17 (XINHUA) -- Chinese delegate 
Choegyal today denounced the slander by a non-governmental 
organization on China's human rights records in Tibet. 
  Speaking at the 50th session of the U.N. Commission on Human 
Rights, Choegyal, who himself is a Tibetan, said a delegate of 
the non-governmental organization, using rumours which he 
himself admitted were unconfirmed, launched an unbridled attack 
against China over its human rights records in the region of 
Tibet. 
  "In fact, he is not concerned about human rights, his real 
motive is to use the human rights issue for dividing China," 
Choegyal said. 
  "As a Tibetan, I have experienced decades of historic 
changes 
since the liberation of Tibet. We are best qualified to comment 
on the situation of human rights in Tibet," Choegyal added. 
  He said that since the peaceful liberation, particularly 
after the democratic reform in 1959, the situation of human 
rights of the Tibetan people has changed radically. 
  In the Tibetan Autonomous Region, there have been great 
economic and social progress and visible improvement of people's 
living standards, with traditional customs being respected and 
religious freedom being protected, Cheogyal said. 
  He said the Tibetan people are wholeheartedly supporting all 
policies of the central government for Tibet, especially those 
designed specially for the region in the past decade. 
  They feel from their own experiences that the past few 
decades have been the best period in terms of the situation of 
their human rights, Cheogyal said. 
  He noted that the speech delivered by the non-governmental 
organization delegate "is full of distortion and fabrication." 
  Choegyal said, "the situation in Tibet today is known to 
everybody, and one can see the overall and real situation there 
as long as he holds a just position." 
  He said that in 1993 alone, government officials, 
parliamentarians, diplomats and journalists from 24 countries 
visited Tibet, in addition to about 10,000 tourists from around 
the world.

  [Text] London, February 17 (XINHUA) -- British Foreign 
Secretary Douglas Hurd said today that the prospect of air 
strikes on Bosnian Serb position around Sarajevo is now more 
remote thanks to Russia, according to a BBC TV report. 
  It is reported here that Russia has decided to send troops 
to 
Sarajevo to help enforce a ceasefire and persuade the Serbs to 
withdraw heavy weapons by next Monday [21 February], as demanded 
under a U.N. ultimatum backed by NATO. 
  Hurd said the Russian move fitted "admirably" with the NATO 
initiative. 
  "If this works on the ground, there is now a much better 
chance than before of avoiding air strikes," he added. 
  But he warned that the air strikes would go ahead if the 
U.N. 
conditions were not met. 
  Meanwhile, the U.N. confirmed today that the Bosnian Serbs 
have started a major withdrawal of heavy guns around Sarajevo, 
press reports said here. 
  U.N. Bosnia Commander Lt-Gen. Sir Michael Rose is reported 
to 
have said that he was confident that the U.N. ultimatum would be 
observed. 
  Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic announced that the 
siege 
of Sarajevo was "over." 
  "We do think that war in Sarajevo is finally over," he said 
after talks with Russian special envoy Vitaliy Churkin. 
  As part of the Moscow plan, 400 Russian soldiers would be 
moved to the Bosnian capital from Croatia. 
  And another significant contingent would be deployed once 
Russia has settled "legal requirement." 
  But Bosnian Government Vice-President Ejup Ganic rejected 
the 
deployment of Russian U.N. troops to control Bosnian Serb heavy 
weapons. 
  He held that Russia is not neutral in the case of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and it didn't go along with the NATO peace 
process. 
  "We are certainly not welcoming Russians to guard Serbian 
weapons," and "we would rather let them keep our weapons than 
Serb weapons," he said.

  [Text] Moscow, February 17 (XINHUA) -- Russia today 
reaffirmed its support for a peaceful solution to the Bosnian 
crisis, saying that it is imperative to rule out the possibility 
of any provocations and acts of sabotage of the peace process. 
  A Russian Foreign Ministry statement said today that Russia 
has made efforts in carrying out the initiative of lifting the 
siege of Sarajevo and putting the city under the United Nations 
control. 
  "We have been seeking and are still seeking the 
implementation of this initiative by acting openly within the 
framework of U.N. Security Council resolutions," the statement 
said. "We continue this line now, despite the serious 
aggravation of the situation around Sarajevo for well-known 
reasons." 
  On February 5, a motar attack on a crowded market center in 
Sarajevo, the capital of the warring Bosnia-Herzegovina, killed 
at least 68 citizens and injured over 200. Four days later, the 
NATO issued an ultimatum threatening to impose air strikes on 
positions around the city. The ultimatum expires on Sunday [20 
February]. 
  The statement said that Bosnian Serbs had adopted a decision 
to withdraw their heavy guns from around Sarajevo in reply to 
the demand of the U.N. Security Council. 
  "We hope that this expression of goodwill by one of the 
warring factions at the critical moment for the settlement (of 
the conflict) will be followed by concrete actions," said the 
statement. 
  It said: "We are calling on the (Muslim-led) Bosnian 
Government to hand over its heavy guns around Sarajevo under 
U.N. control without delay, as envisaged by the U.N. 
secretary-general's plan proposed in his letter to the Security 
Council on February 10." 
  The statement also called on the United States and the 
European Union nations to exert, in the spirit of their 
statements preferring a political solution of the problem, the 
necessary influence on the Bosnian Government to make it 
cooperate with the United Nations in reaching full deblocking 
and demilitarization of Sarajevo. 
  "At this crucial time it is extremely important to rule out 
the possibility of any provocation and acts of sabotage of this 
peace process," the statement stressed. 
  It also said after lifting the siege of Sarajevo the U.N. 
Security Council could immediately start considering ways to 
establish U.N. administrative rule in the city, as well as 
measures to strengthen other safe heavens on the territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Paris, February 17 (XINHUA) -- France today 
expressed "deep concern" over Greece's retaliatory measures 
against the Republic of Macedonia. 
  Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou announced the steps 
on Wednesday [16 February], saying that Macedonia "insists on 
its claims to Greek land." 
  The measures include closing the northern Greek port of 
Salonica to Macedonia, and closing the Greek Consulate in the 
Macedonian capital of Skopje. 
  French Foreign Ministry Spokesman Richard Duque said 
Thursday 
that the Greek decision "departs from the dialogue between 
Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which 
France has sincerely encouraged." 
  He stressed that in the present context "the easing of 
tensions should be a common concern." 
  Macedonia, a former Yugoslav Republic contiguous to Greece, 
declared independence in 1991 and was admitted to the United 
Nations General Assembly last April. 
  Greece has been trying to block international recognition of 
Macedonia, arguing that it has designs on a northern Greek 
province that is also called Macedonia. But Macedonia's 
government says it has no claims on northern Greece. 
  France established diplomatic relations with the former 
Yugoslav Republic last December. 
  It has been reported that Greece did not inform its partners 
in the European Union before Wednesday's announcement.

  [Text] Bonn, February 17 (XINHUA) -- German Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl today urged all parties concerned with the conflict 
in Bosnia to explore every chance of finding a settlement 
through negotiations before the NATO ultimatum expires. 
  Speaking on German television, Kohl said he had phoned U.S. 
President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin about 
the Bosnian conflict and the NATO ultimatum during the day. 
  He said the two presidents should seek a peaceful solution 
to 
the conflict by taking advantage of the good relations between 
them. 
  The chancellor also announced that Germany will provide 
backup support for their NATO allies when necessary. 
  The NATO ultimatum orders both Bosnian Serb and Moslem 
forces 
to relinquish control of their heavy weapons in Sarajevo by 
midnight on February 20, or face Allied air strikes. 
  The ultimatum came after a mortar attack on a Sarajevo 
street 
market on February 5 killed 68 people and wounded nearly 200. 
  Over the past few days, the international community has 
tried 
to avert an escalation of the Bosnian war in hopes that the NATO 
ultimatum will be able to end the 22-month-long Bosnian war. 
  Also today, the United States, Britain, and France welcomed 
a 
Russian proposal to send Russian troops to Sarajevo in exchange 
for the withdrawal of Serbian heavy weaponry from around the 
Bosnian capital. 
  But they emphasized that the NATO ultimatum still holds -- 
heavy weapons must be withdrawn or placed under U.N. control by 
the deadline, or face Allied air strikes.

  [Text] Paris, February 17 (XINHUA) -- The Bosnian Serbs 
have agreed to withdraw their heavy weapons stationed within a 
20- kilometer range of Sarajevo, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev told his French counterpart Alain Juppe on telephone 
today. 
  According to French Foreign Ministry Spokesman Richard 
Duque, 
Kozyrev told Juppe that Russian President Boris Yeltsin's 
special envoy Vitaliy Churkin had persuaded the Serbs to do so. 
  Duque said that France welcomes Russia's efforts, stressing 
that France has all along stood for "more Russian participation 
in the diplomatic activities to solve the Bosnia crisis." 
  He added that "we are waiting for this news to be confirmed 
and to be translated into actions on the ground." 
  Juppe today talked over telephone with U.N. Secretary 
General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali and senior officials of Western allies and 
Russia, said Duque. 
  Duque quoted Juppe as reiterating France's "determination to 
implement NATO ultimatum" and its willingness to "work for a 
political solution through joint efforts by the European Union, 
U.S. and Russia." 
  He said that the NATO demands must be met and that France is 
looking forward to "an unambiguous application, within the 
deadline, of the decisions taken by NATO." 
  NATO has threatened to bomb Serbs' mortar positions around 
Sarajevo if the Serbs fail to withdraw their heavy weapons or 
put them under U.N. control by midnight GMT on Sunday [20 
February]. 
  Russia also announced that it agreed to move to Sarajevo 
part 
of its peacekeeping forces now in Croatia.

  [Text] Sarajevo, February 17 (XINHUA) -- Serb forces on 
Thursday [17 February] started withdrawing from the hillsides of 
besieged Sarajevo in apparent compliance with a NATO ultimatum 
to retreat, a UN spokesman said today. 
  "Literally they're moving out in convoys, not in individual 
vehicles," said UN Spokesman Lt. Col Bill Aikman. 
  The pullout of Serb forces came soon after Russian announced 
that it had persuaded the Serbs to comply with an agreement 
concluded on February 9 with the United Nations forces and the 
Muslim-led Bosnian army. 
  Aikman said that General Michael Rose, commander of the UN 
Protection Force (UNPROFER) in Bosnia, "has received information 
from senior levels of the Bosnian Serb government that they will 
have their equipment out of a 20-kilometer zone within 36 hours, 
that means well before the deadline of midnight Sunday night." 
  On February 5, a mortar attack on a crowded market center in 
Sarajevo, the capital of the warring Bosnia-Herzegovina, killed 
68 people and injured over 200. Four days later, the NATO asked 
all warring sides to withdraw from the area and issued an 
ultimatum threatening to impose air strikes on positions around 
the city. The ultimatum expires on Sunday.

  [Text] Belgrade, February 17 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Serb 
Leader Radovan Karadzic and Fikret Abdic [names as received], 
chairman of "the Autonomous Province of West Bosnia," a Muslim 
enclave, have agreed to ends hostilities forever and hold 
political negotiations, the presidential office of "the Serb 
republic" announced today. 
  The cease-fire agreement, which goes into effect on February 
18, is an important step toward peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
announcement said. 
  Abdic said the peace agreement will be implemented within 
his 
province. He also assured peace on the left bank of the Una 
River, controlled by troops loyal to the Sarajevo Muslim 
government. 
  "The Autonomous Province of West Bosnia" is a Muslim enclave 
in the western portion of Bosnia. 
  The province declared independence last September because of 
differences with other Muslim leaders. Since then the province 
has been in a state of hostility with the Muslim government in 
Sarajevo Led by President Alija Izetbegovic, and armed conflict 
between the two sides has been constant.

  [Text] Belgrade, February 17 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Serb 
leader Radovan Karadzic said today that the Bosnian Serbs have 
accepted a Russian proposal to stop the confrontation with NATO. 
  The new proposal calls on Serbs to withdraw their heavy 
weaponry from around Sarajevo, while Russia dispatches 400 
soldiers, now serving in the UN Protection Force in Croatia, to 
Sarajevo to guarantee the peace. 
  Karadzic made the announcement after meeting outside 
Sarajevo 
with Russian presidential envoy and Deputy Foreign Minister 
Vitaliy Churkin. 
  During the meeting Churkin gave Karadzic a letter from 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin. 
  According to Serbian sources, Yeltsin asked the Serbs to 
withdraw their heavy weaponry from around Sarajevo immediately 
in order to avoid bloodshed and establish peace in Sarajevo and 
all of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Karadzic described the Russian proposal as "helpful and 
constructive" for the peace process. 
  Churkin said that Russia's proposal will end the possibility 
that any side in the Bosnian conflict will gain the upper hand. 
  He also expressed the hope that the Bosnian Muslims would 
also accept the Russian proposal. 
  He pointed out that the UN Protection Force in Bosnia should 
fulfill its peacekeeping duties and supervise all sides in the 
conflict. 
  The overwhelming opinion here is that NATO will not carry 
out 
air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions since all the conditions 
required by NATO have been met.

  [Text] Washington, February 17 (XINHUA) -- The Pentagon 
reiterated today that there was no flexibility in the Sunday [20 
February] deadline for the Bosnian Serbs to remove their heavy 
weapons from Sarajevo. 
  Although encouraged by the pace of the Serbs' latest pullout 
of heavy artillery from Sarajevo, Pentagon Spokeswoman Kathleen 
Delasky said the Serbs still had "a long way to go" to avoid the 
threatened NATO air strikes. 
  Delasky confirmed that U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry 
and Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili would 
join defense ministers of Britain, France, Italy and the 
Netherlands for a NATO briefing on air strikes in Italy on 
Sunday. 
  "The meeting also provides an opportunity to discuss steps 
to 
reinvigorate the peace plan," Delasky said. 
  Earlier today, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said the 
Serbs had agreed to withdraw heavy weapons from Sarajevo 
following a proposal that Russian troops would help enforce a 
ceasefire in the city. 
  "We do think that war in Sarajevo is finally over," Karadzic 
said. 
  At the White House, Spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers gave a 
measured 
response to the development. 
  "If this means that the Serbs will comply with NATO's 
decision then it is a positive step," Myers said. "We'll just 
have to wait and see."

  [Text] Jerusalem, February 15 (XINHUA) -- French Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe said here today that, as far as Bosnia is 
concerned, "there are many opportunities" for people to choose 
in the days before the NATO's ultimatum deadline which falls on 
February 20. 
  Asked by XINHUA to comment on the latest developments in 
Bosnia at a press conference this evening, Juppe said that he 
hoped a peace process will take place in the war-torn republic. 
  NATO agreed on February 9 to threaten Bosnian Serb forces 
with air strikes unless they withdraw their big guns from around 
Sarajevo within a maximum of 10 days. 
  Under an agreement brokered by the U.N. Commander for 
Bosnia, 
Michael Rose, Bosnian Serbs besieging Sarajevo continue to turn 
their big guns over to U.N. control and Sarajevo was reported to 
be quiet for the fifth day by Monday. 
  But tension remains high over NATO's ticking ultimatum to 
the 
Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons by February 20 or 
be bombed. 
  Juppe, who arrived in Israel Sunday for a three-day official 
visit, met Monday with Israeli President Ezer Weizman, Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. 
  Juppe told reporters at the press conference that a new page 
has begun in relations between France and Israel, adding that 
there is now an improvement both in the political and military 
spheres. 
  French defense minister will pay a visit to Israel next 
month 
to advance cooperation in the areas of research, development and 
technology. 
  Earlier today, the French foreign minister also met with 
Palestinian leaders from the occupied territories in east 
Jerusalem and promised an additional aid of 10 million U.S. 
dollars to the Palestinians in Gaza and Jericho to be granted 
self-rule under Israel-PLO accord signed last September 13.

<F P=106> ['Feature' by Hu Xudong: "Germans Benefit from </F>
U.S.-Japanese Trade War"] 
  [Text] Bonn, February 18 (XINHUA) -- There is an ancient 
proverb which says, "it's the third party that benefits from the 
tussle." Now, the Germans are the third party benefiting while 
the Americans and Japanese tussle with each other in a trade war. 
  The initial reaction to the collapse of U.S.-Japanese trade 
negotiations earlier this month was the sharp rise of the 
Japanese yen. 
  Just before negotiations broke down on February 11, the 
exchange rate between the yen and the German mark was 100 yen to 
1.62 marks. But on February 15, the yen's rate against the mark 
rose to a high of 100 yen to 1.68 marks, with the yen gaining 
four percentage points in trading against the mark in just four 
days. 
  This depreciation of the mark means that German companies 
can 
earn more from exports to Japan. 
  If German exports to Japan can be regarded as only a small 
proportion of the German economy, the appreciation of the yen 
does have a significant effect on the German economy. 
  It is apparent that Germany's role is similar to that of 
Japan in the world's economic affairs. But the sale of 
Japanese-manufactured goods represents a large share of the 
German market. 
  Because of lower prices, Japanese goods, including 
automobiles and home appliances, enjoy good sales in the German 
market. 
  Now, with the appreciation of the yen, if the Japanese 
companies want to retain the same profit level they will have to 
raise prices. 
  Consequently, any increase in the price of Japanese goods 
will contribute to the competitiveness of German goods in the 
domestic market. This could be a shot of "cardiac stimulant" 
for the recession-hit German economy. 
  Both Japan and Germany are major exporters. The Germans also 
benefit from the appreciation of the yen in terms of competition 
in the markets of other countries. 
  Also, as a result of the appreciation of the yen, the mark 
has remained firm against the U.S. dollar. 
  As Germany is only slowly recovering from recession, a 
motivating force is needed. 
  The benefit the Germans gain from the U.S.-Japanese trade 
war 
will undoubtedly contribute to the recovery. 
  But the question is, how long will the good times last? 
  In an effort to stop continued increase in the value of the 
yen, Japan is selling the yen in large quantities. At the same 
time, the United States has increased certain interest rates in 
order to defend the U.S. dollar. 
  It also remains uncertain what kind of agreement Japan and 
the United States will reach to ease their trade conflict. 
  In its latest monthly economic report issued on Wednesday, 
Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, said that Germany had 
not yet recovered from the worst recession since World War II. 
  On Thursday, the Bundesbank cut its discount rate, a key 
interest rate, by half a percentage point to 5.25 percent, in an 
apparent effort to inject vigor into the economy. 
  Any lowering of the central bank's major interest rates may 
be effective in stimulating economic development, but will 
likely weaken the mark. 
  Thus, the central bank, while lowering the discount rate, 
left its less important Lombard rate unchanged at 6.75 percent, 
and held another key money market interest rate unchanged at 
6.00 percent.

  [Text] Beijing, February 18 (XINHUA) -- Chinese 
Vice-President Rong Yiren met with George Shultz, former 
secretary of state of the United States, and his party here this 
morning. 
  Shultz is here as director and senior consultant of the U.S. 
based Bectel company. 
  During the meeting, they had a friendly conversation on 
issues of Sino-U.S. economic cooperation. 
  Rong briefed Shultz on the current situation of China's 
economic development, saying that China is to speed up reforms 
in finance, tax revenue and other fields this year. 
  Touching on economic cooperation between China and the 
United 
States, the vice-president said that there is now a good 
opportunity to further expand such cooperation, adding that 
China welcomes the U.S. industrial and commercial circles to 
further strengthen their cooperation with the Chinese side. 
  Rong expressed the hope that cooperation between Bectel and 
the China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) 
on the development of Daxie Island, which is located in Ningbo 
city, East China's Zhejiang Province, will be successful. 
  Shultz said that he is confident cooperation between Bectel 
and China will be expanded. 
  Chairman Wei Mingyi of CITIC and Vice-Foreign Minister Liu 
Huaqiu took part in the meeting. 
  This afternoon, Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji met with Shultz and

  [Text] Tianjin, February 17 (XINHUA) -- Thirty-seven U.S. 
companies invested nearly 20 million U.S. dollars in Tianjin in 
January, according to a local government department. 
  An official of the municipal commission of foreign trade and 
economic cooperation said that Tianjin, the leading 
manufacturing center in north China, currently has 840 
U.S.-funded businesses with a total American investment of 710 
million dollars. 
  American investors have taken Tianjin as an ideal place to 
invest in since it was one of the first group of coastal cities 
in China to open to overseas investors, he said. 
  Tianjin experienced what he called an "American investment 
wave" in 1993, he said. 
  The city last year approved 513 U.S.-funded firms involving 
340 million dollars in total American investment. 
  American companies invest in a wide range of sectors, 
including manufacturing industry, farming, international trade, 
banking, information, hotels and real estate. 
  Manufacturers account for at least half of U.S.-funded 
companies in Tianjin, he said. 
  A number of multi-national companies, including Motorola 
Electronics, the Coca-Cola Company, Kraft General Foods 
International Corporation, the International Telegraph and 
Telephone Company, the AST Company, IBM, the Otis Elevator 
Company and the Smithline Beckman Corporation, have opened 
businesses in Tianjin. 
  The China head office of AST in Tianjin is rated as the 
largest foreign investment project in China's computer industry, 
the official said. 
  The Tianjin branch of the Chase Manhattan Bank of the United 
States is the bank's first branch in China. 
  Local economists agreed that Tianjin's appeal to American 
investors lies in its good infrastructure, a whole range of 
industries, a competent technical force and a workforce with a 
high sense of discipline. 
  In recent years, products from U.S.-funded companies in 
Tianjin have become increasingly popular in Tianjin and the rest 
of China. They include Otis elevators, Motorola beepers, 
Smithline medicines and Coca-Cola. 
  Most products from these companies are sold in the Chinese 
market, according to the economists. This serves as another 
factor attracting American investors, one official said. 
  Michael E. Lin, vice-president of a multi-national company 
of 
the United States, said: "If you want to invest in China, you 
must seize every second, because losing an investment 
opportunity means losing a big market." 
  The third factor encouraging American firms to invest in 
Tianjin is that most operational U.S.-funded businesses are 
profitable. 
  Government statistics show that these Tianjin businesses 
generated a total of 860 million yuan in profits and taxes in 
1993, nearly 30 percent of the total made by all foreign-funded 
firms in the city. 
  Four of the ten foreign-funded firms chosen as the most 
efficient enterprises in Tianjin in 1993 are U.S.-funded 
companies, the official of the municipal commission of foreign 
trade and economic cooperation said. 
  Most U.S.-funded companies have already recovered their 
investment, he said. 
  For example, the Motorola (China) Electronics Company has 
generated 84 million yuan since it opened a year ago and has 
decided to spend another 100 million U.S. dollars to expand 
production. 
  The Tianmei Food Company, a joint venture between a local 
company and the Kraft General Food International Corporation of 
the U.S., has generated 200 million in profits and taxes since 
it opened six years ago. 
  As a result, each partner has earned 20 million yuan in net 
profits, the official said. 
  The American firm decided last year to increase its shares 
to 
60 percent from 50 percent. 
  The joint venture is now building a new factory in the 
Tianjin economic and technological development zone to quintuple 
its annual production, he said.

  [Text] Tianjin, February 18 (XINHUA) -- The Tianjin Toyo 
Ink Co. Ltd, a new Sino-Japanese joint venture in this north 
China port city, will go into operation in April this year. 
  According to Li Zhaolong, general manager of the company, it 
will be the biggest ink producer in China. When it is completed 
it will be able to produce more than 30,000 tons of ink annually. 
  The company involves a total investment of 48 million U.S. 
dollars and an investment profit rate of 18.9 percent, he said. 
  Li added that the Japanese Toyo Company will assist in the 
development of a new ink factory of 50,000 sq m, to be built by 
the Tianjin Joint Stock Ink Company, whose products, such as 
"Tiannu" and "Xiangyang" ink, enjoy a good reputation in both 
the domestic and world markets. 
  The agreement for building the joint venture was signed at 
the end of 1993, and the first foreign investment installment of 
11 million U.S. dollars has already arrived, the official added.

  [Text] Beijing, Feb 18 (AFP)--China brushed aside Friday a 
warning from Vietnam against sending oil exploration vessels to 
the disputed Spratly islands, and denied breaching any bilateral 
agreement with Hanoi. 
  "China has indisputable sovereignty over the Spratly islands 
and their adjacent seas," a Foreign Ministry spokesman said. 
  Following reports that two Chinese prospecting ships were on 
their way to the Spratlys, Vietnam warned China on Thursday that 
their presence would violate an agreement to avoid complicating 
negotiations on the disputed archipelago. 
  Since China and Vietnam normalised relations in 1991, both 
sides have repeatedly accused each other of violating their 
sovereignty over the tiny atolls. 
  "It is entirely justifiable and legitimate for Chinese ships 
to conduct inspection activities on the adjacent seas of the 
islands," the spokesman said, adding that "the question of 
violating written agreements between Vietnam and China does not 
exist." 
  As well as China and Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia, the 
Philippines and Brunei all claim at least some of the islands, 
which are near vital shipping lanes and are believed to lie 
above substantial oil reserves.

  [Text] Hanoi, February 17 (XINHUA) -- Vietnamese Foreign 
Ministry spokeswoman Ho The Lan said today that normalization of 
Vietnamese-U.S. ties should have no political conditions 
attached. 
  She told reporters that Vietnam would hold dialogue with the 
United States on all issues of common concern, including human 
rights, on the basis of equality and mutual respect but 
including non-interference in each other's internal affairs. 
  She said that the process of normalization of relations 
would 
depend on the efforts and sincerity of both sides. 
  Since the United States announced it was lifting its trade 
embargo against Vietnam on February 3, the human-rights issue 
has become the major problem in Vietnamese-U.S. relations. 
  The U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord, who is 
in charge of Asian affairs, has said the relations between the 
two countries would develop only if Vietnam demonstrates an 
improvement in its approach to human rights. 
  However, Ho The Lan said that although Vietnam believes in 
the importance of developing ties with the U.S. it would be on 
the basis of non-interference in each other's internal affairs. 
  She added that the two sides have agreed to discuss in Hanoi 
the set-up of liaison offices and will hold talks on the human 
rights issue in New York at the end of this month.

  [Text] Canberra, 15 Feb (XINHUA) -- Australian Prime 
Minister Keating told visiting Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten 
in their talks this afternoon that he wishes to see the 
continued prosperity and stability of Hong Kong in the 
transition to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. 
  In a phone interview with XINHUA, a spokesman for Keating 
said that during the talks, the prime minister stressed that 
Hong Kong's prosperity and stability is important to Australia. 
The spokesman said: The talks between Keating and Patten 
focused on reinforcing bilateral economic relations and trade, 
Hong Kong's role in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, 
and regional security. 
  Australia has close economic ties with Hong Kong. Hong Kong 
is among Australia's top eight trading partners. Australia's 
investment in Hong Kong rose 23 percent last year, approaching 
$1.8 billion. 
  Patten started his week-long official visit here on 13 
January. Although he claimed that the main purpose of his visit 
is to reinforce bilateral economic ties, in a speech he gave 
last evening and in his conversations with press circles, he 
went to great lengths to publicize his "constitutional reform 
package" in an attempt to win Australia's support. 
  Keating has said publicly that his government is not 
interested in Patten's "constitutional reform package." 
  Leaders of Overseas Chinese organizations and business 
circles in Australia have issued statements one after another in 
recent days which said that Patten and the stuff he is trying to 
promote in Hong Kong are not welcome in the Chinese community in 
Australia.

  [Text] Hong Kong, 17 Feb (XINHUA) -- Guo Fengmin, chief 
Chinese representative to the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, 
pointed out recently that the Chinese side had systematically 
forwarded its views on the new airport's overall financial 
arrangements as early as last August, whereas the British side 
only now has presented its new financial arrangements, and thus 
the responsibility for delaying the solution of the new airport 
issue does not lie with the Chinese side. 
  In responding to reporters' questions after attending a 
Spring Festival gathering hosted yesterday by the New Territory 
District Board, Guo Fengmin said: The Chinese side has 
preliminarily studied the fourth new airport financial plan 
forwarded by the British side. Because the new airport issue 
involves so many aspects, the Chinese side is now conducting 
in-depth studies of certain questions, some of which require a 
further exchange of views with its British counterpart. China 
and Britain will first exchange views at the experts level to 
pave the way for the Airport Committee meeting. 
  Guo Fengmin pointed out: Sometime back, people from the Hong 
Kong British side said that the Chinese side virtually did not 
forward any comprehensive views on the new airport issue, and 
recently there were also people who said that the plan submitted 
by the British side has fully met the demands of the Chinese 
side. Is this not self-contradictory? Because the Chinese side 
has not forwarded any comprehensive views, from where did the 
so-called plan that has "fully met the demands of the Chinese 
side" come? He said: During the Airport Committee meeting last 
August, the Chinese side had systematically forwarded its 
opinions, and the British side only presented its plan after a 
lapse of nearly six months -- from August up to the present -- 
so it is rather obvious who is delaying. 
  Guo Fengmin expressed his hope that substantive progress 
will 
be made by the meeting of the Defense and Security Experts 
Subgroup of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group next week. He 
also criticized the British side for dragging things out too 
long over this matter. He said: Some people are now 
deliberately creating the impression that the Chinese side is 
delaying matters, but in fact, that is not true. It is also the 
British side which has delayed for several years the discussion 
of the question of land used for defense and military purposes.

  [Text] Hong Kong, February 17 (XINHUA) -- Senior Chinese 
representative of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) Guo 
Fengmin has rejected the groundless charge from the British side 
on the responsibility for the delay of the new airport to be 
built in Hong Kong. 
  The Chinese side put forward a whole set of opinions on the 
overall financing plan on the airport construction at Chek Lap 
Kok as early as last August. But the British side failed to 
respond for a half-year period, Guo said after attending a local 
Spring Festival gathering. 
  Therefore, Guo stated, China should not be responsible for 
the delay of the construction of the new Hong Kong airport. 
  He regarded two British blames as "contradictive". One 
saying China doesn't raise any proposal on the airport financing 
plan, while other saying the new proposal recently advanced by 
the British side satisfied all the demands raised by the Chinese 
side. 
  If the Chinese side never advanced any opinions, how could 
it 
be possible to say the British side has satisfied all the 
Chinese demands? Guo asked. 
  He said the Chinese side had studied some problems with the 
British plan, the fourth one proposed by Britain. 
  However, he added, "the airport issue covers a wide range of 
subjects, we are studying further into some problems and will 
exchange opinions with the British side." 
  The Sino-British negotiation on the airport issue will have 
to be opened. But it depends necessary preparations before 
hand, he said. [sentence as received]

  [Text] Hong Kong, February 17 (XINHUA) -- It is useless for 
Governor Chris Patten to play international cards and no 
official of a third country has the right to make irresponsible 
remarks about the issue of Hong Kong. 
  Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of XINHUA news agency Hong 
Kong branch, made these remarks in response to reporters' 
questions about Patten's on-going Australia visit at a spring 
cocktail reception here this evening. 
  "This is not the first time for Patten to play international 
cards. He did so as early as in 1992," Zhang said. 
  He reiterated that the Hong Kong issue should be studied and 
discussed only between China and Britain and no third country 
has the right to interfere in Hong Kong's affairs. 
  "We maintain that China and Britain should cooperate in 
handling affairs such as elections during the transitional 
period, but the British side refused to cooperate and the 
Sino-British negotiations have subsequently broken down," Zhang 
said. 
  Without agreements between China and Britain, the three-tier 
councils will all be terminated on June 30, 1997, and be 
reorganized, the deputy director added.

  [Text] Hong Kong, February 17 (XINHUA) -- A senior Chinese 
official in charge of Hong Kong Affairs has reiterated China's 
position that the Chinese side would not accept any unilateral 
political reform scheme taken by the British-Hong Kong 
authorities on the arrangement for the 1994-95 elections to be 
held in Hong Kong. 
  China would like to have the 1994-95 electoral arrangements 
in Hong Kong settled in the form of bilateral negotiation 
between the Chinese and British Governments as the term of 
office for the would-be members of the Legislative Council and 
of district and urban councils will go through 1997, the year 
for the transition of power in Hong Kong, said Zheng Guoxiong, 
deputy director of the Hong Kong branch of the XINHUA NEWS 
AGENCY after attending a local public gathering. 
  But the fact has been known to all, the British side had 
announced, unilaterally, the termination of Sino-British talks 
and put it into action by submitting Governor Chris Patten's 
political reform bill to the Hong Kong Legislative Council, 
Zheng said. 
  Under such circumstance, the term of office for members of 
the three-tier councils will have to terminate on June 30, 1997 
no matter what resolutions to be passed by the Hong Kong 
Legislative Council, the deputy director stated. 
  The Chinese side will have the three-tier councils 
re-elected 
by July 1, 1997 in accordance with principles provided by the 
Basic Law of the Future Government of the hong kong Special 
Administrative Region, he added. 
  Zheng's speech was made after the Hong Kong Government 
decided to gazette tomorrow a new regulation which sets out the 
procedure for the registration of electors in geographical 
constituencies for the three-tier elections. 
  China stated this consistent position time and again over 
the 
past months. The Chinese side passed on the message to the 
British side when the governor gazetted part of his political 
reform bill on the 1994-95 electoral arrangements and reiterated 
its principle stand when Patten introduced his partial bill to 
the Legislative Council. 
  He expressed that the Chinese side would speed up 
preparations for the resumption of its exercise of sovereignty 
over Hong Kong and called on the broad masses of Hong Kong 
people to take part in the matter. 
  He assured local residents that China will adopt a positive 
attitude in cooperation with the British-Hong Kong authorities 
and in the solution of matters relating to the everyday life of 
local residents.

  [Text] A Boeing-737 airplane from Mainland China's 
Southwest Airlines was hijacked while en route from Changsha to 
Fuzhou this morning, and landed at Chiang Kai-shek Airport at 
1042 [0242 GMT]. It was the 11th Communist Chinese airliner 
hijacked to Taiwan since 6 April last year. 
  According to sources, there were 120 passengers and eight 
crew members on the Boeing-737 airliner bearing the serial 
number B-2599. At 1018, aviation control units from our Air 
Force spotted the airliner deviating from its route. The Tainan 
Air Base sent two F-5E fighters to guide the airliner to land. 
The authorities have instructed through proper channels that 
the matter be handled in accordance with the established 
principles. 
  Since the ninth Communist Chinese airliner was hijacked to 
Taiwan late last year, the government has lowered the level at 
which it will comment on airplane hijackings.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Chun Ching-lin, Domestic </F>
Information Service Department director under the Government 
Information Office and a member of the government's task force 
for dealing with airplane hijackings, by unidentified reporter 
at Chiang Kai-shek Airport; from the "News" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Director Chung, how are you? 
  [Chung] How are you? 
  [Reporter] Would you please provide us the latest 
information on the hijacking? 
  [Chung] To my knowledge, the airplane took off from Changsha 
at 0928 [0128 GMT], was hijacked over Nanping in Fuchou at 1005, 
and landed at Chiang Kai-shek Airport in Taoyuan at 1043. It 
was towed to a standby parking apron. The hijacker (Lin 
Wen-chiang) deplaned at 1055. This is the general picture of 
the hijacking. 
  [Reporter] Director Chung, have the passengers left the 
airplane? 
  [Chung] The passengers have not deplaned, but the hijacker 
has. 
  [Reporter] Are there any differences between this hijacking 
and previous ones? 
  [Chung] There are no differences. 
  [Reporter] Has Communist China taken any measures after our 
aviation control units found out about the hijacking? 
  [Chung] Not yet. Its past practice was to send an official 
message inquring about the general situation. However, it has 
not done so this time. 
  [Reporter] Have we sent personnel on board to conduct a 
safety inspection and carry out other measures? 
  [Chung] Deputy Director (Pan) of the Airport Police Bureau's 
Criminal Police Squad boarded the plane at 1052 to conduct 
negotiations and later led the hijacker off the plane. 
  [Reporter] Director Chung, would you please give us more 
information on the hijacker's identity and motive? 
  [Chung] According to our investigation at the airport, the 
hijacker (Lin Wen-chiang) was born on 8 June 1958. He donned a 
military uniform to pose as an armed police officer to carry out 
the hijacking. His family has five members, including himself, 
his foster mother, wife, and two children aged 7 and 9, 
respectively. By his own account, he hijacked the airplane 
because he was given a hard time by the local government when he 
applied for permission to set up a company in Changsha where he 
had been doing business. He decided to leave Communist China 
because he found its authorities corrupt. 
  [Reporter] Did the hijacker incur resistance or was anybody 
injured during the hijacking? 
  [Chung] This is still under investigation. We are waiting 
for officials from the Taoyuan District Prosecutor's Office to 
conduct an interrogation.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 18 (CNA) -- A mainland soldier, 
identified as Lin Wenqiang, teamed up with his wife and three 
other family members to hijack a Southwest China Airlines Boeing 
737 to Taiwan Friday morning. 
  It was the first hijacking of a mainland passenger plane to 
Taiwan in 1994 and the 11th since last April. 
  Lin, 26, wearing the uniform of a People's Liberation Army 
soldier, forced the Boeing 737 to Taiwan with a knife and a 
glass filled with tissue paper which lin claimed was an 
explosive, airport police reported. 
  The hijacking was reported at around 10:30 a.m. [0130 GMT] 
after a Southwest China Airlines 737 flying from Chengdu in 
Sichuan Province veered off course over Fuzhou and approached 
Taiwan. 
  The flight, with 122 passengers and eight crew members on 
board, landed in Taiwan at 10:43 a.m. and was expected to fly 
back to the mainland via Hong Kong after refueling, the police 
said. 
  Lin, his wife, mother and two children were arrested for 
their involvement in the hijacking and were sent to the office 
of the Taoyuan prosecutor for questioning. 
  The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said Friday that 
Taiwan 
will continue to abide by the provisions of the Hague 
Convention, which requires separate treatment for hijacked 
aircraft and hijackers. 
  Despite several rounds of negotiations between SEF and its 
mainland counterpart Association for Relations Across the Taiwan 
Strait (ARATS), the two sides failed to reach any agreement on 
ways to avoid the repeated hijackings. 
  Friday's hijacking underlined air security problems on the 
Chinese Mainland. A Wednesday report by the International 
Airline Passengers Association called air travel in the 
mainland, "an ongoing disaster," and urged visitors to the 
mainland to avoid air travel. 
  Last year, ten mainland passenger airplanes were hijacked to 
Taiwan. The hijackings occurred on a number of different flight 
paths and took place in the months of April, June, August, 
September, October, November and December.

  [Text] Another Mainland airplane was hijacked to Taiwan 
again today after almost two quiet months. A Boeing-737 from 
Mainland China's Southwest Airlines was hijacked while en route 
from Chengtu [Chengdu], Szechuan [Sichuan] to Fuchow [Fuzhou] 
this morning, and landed at Chiang Kai-shek [CKS] Airport at 
1042 [0242 GMT]. 
  According to investigations, the man who hijacked the 
airplane was 25-year-old [age as heard] Lin Wenqiang. His wife, 
(Huang Chun-mien); his two children, (Li Hsin-yao) and (Li 
Hsin-kao); and his 68-year-old foster mother (Li Yu-ying) were 
also on board. The family of five were led by the aviation 
police off the plane for further investigations. 
  The airplane has departed CKS Airport at 1444 [0644 GMT]. 
Except for Lin Wenqiang, his family and other passengers on 
board were expatriated in the airplane. 
  It is understood that hijacker Lin Wenqiang, 25, is a Fukien 
[Fujian] native. Today, he donned a uniform to pose as a 
Communist Chinese armed police officer. To carry out the 
hijacking, he carried a fruit knife and placed tissue paper in a 
teacup to pass it off as an explosive device. According to the 
hijacker's confessions, he hijacked the airplane to Taiwan in a 
rage over the Communist Chinese local government's obstruction 
of his application to set up a company.

<F P=106> [By Lawrence Chung] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, Feb 18 (AFP)--Armed with a fruit knife and 
a fake bomb and accompanied by his foster mother, wife and two 
children, a Chinese man hijacked a mainland airliner to Taiwan 
Friday -- the 11th such incident in 10 months. 
  Taiwan authorities sent Lin Wenqiang's family of four back 
to 
China aboard aboard the Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 later 
Friday. 
  The hijacking, the first this year, is expected to prompt 
China and Taiwan to reopen talks on the repatriation of 
hijackers, which collapsed over sovereignty and jurisdiction 
issues, officials here said. 
  Lin, 26 [age as received], a businessman from the southern 
Chinese province of Fujian, told Taiwan police he was persecuted 
by the communists in China and thus sought political asylum in 
Taiwan. 
  Dressed as a Chinese police officer, Lin surrendered to 
police immediately after the airplane touched down at Taiwan's 
international airport, police said. 
  The plane had been scheduled to fly from Chengdu in Sichuan 
province to the southern coastal city of Fuzhou. 
  The plane carrying 130 people, including the hijacker, his 
family and eight crew, began the journey from Changsha, Hunan 
province. 
  "They (the communists) persecuted me ... and repeatedly 
turned down my application to open a business," police quoted 
Lin as saying in the initial investigation. 
  Lin and his family -- his foster mother Li Yuying, 68, his 
wife Wang Chunlian, 23, his two sons Li Zhanghao, 9, and Li 
Zhangyao, 11,-- were taken to the airport police department for 
questioning, police said. 
  "Investigation showed that the family were previously not 
aware of what the suspect would do, and so they were sent back 
along with other passengers," Interior Minister Wu Poh-hsiung 
told reporters here. 
  But the wife resisted being put back on the plane and had to 
be forced, police said. 
  The jetliner and the 129 people, including family members 
and 
crew, returned to China four hours after the plane landed here 
at 10:43 a.m. (0243 GMT). 
  Lin was taken to the prosecutor's office for further 
questioning, police said. 
  "As the hijacking took place in Taiwan, we have the absolute 
right to handle the case here and try the suspect before 
deciding whether to send him back," Wu said. 
  Hijacking suspects' trials have been the major source of 
disagreement in the repatriation talks by the two sides of the 
Taiwan Strait. 
  The spate of hijackings, involving 15 mainlanders, including 
Lin, has become a new source of frictions between Taiwan and 
China. 
  The two have remained rivals since the 1949 Chinese civil 
war 
after which the defeated Nationalists fled to Taiwan. Both 
governments claim sovereignty over all of China. 
  China and Taiwan, represented by their semi-official 
agencies, began negotiations in Beijing in August 1993. 
  The second round of talks was held in China's coastal city 
of 
Xiamen last November, and the third round was in Taipei in 
December. 
  "They are reluctant to recognize our legal jurisdiction over 
the handling of the hijackers here, including trying them in 
Taiwan," Chiao Jen-ho, vice chairman of the semi-official 
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), charged. 
  SEF handles the negotiations on Taiwan's behalf. 
  "I believe the latest incident would prompt the mainland to 
realize the importance of the issue and to hold further talks 
with us," Chiao said. 
  Taiwan's cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Friday 
expressed regret over the incident and called on China to 
quickly reopen talks with Taipei to resolve the issue. 
  Taiwan has so far sentenced six of the 15 hijackers to jail 
terms ranging from six years to ten years.

<F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 18 (CNA) -- Legislators from both the 
ruling party and opposition on Friday demanded that the 
government review its policy regarding Mainland Chinese 
hijackers who commandeer passengers planes to Taiwan, saying it 
is not harsh enough to curb the cross-strait air piracy. 
  Both Kuomintang Legislator Hung Chao-nan and Democratic 
Progressive Party Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung insisted that the 
existing measures be thoroughly reviewed. 
  Mainland hijackers have been sentenced to up to 15 years in 
prison here, but under current policy, will not be repatriated 
to the mainland after they serve their terms. 
  The two lawmakers made the remarks following reports that a 
Boeing 737 aircraft with 122 passengers and eight crew members 
on board was diverted to Taiwan Friday morning as it was en 
route from Chengdu to Fuzhou, a city in the southern coastal 
province of China. 
  It was the 11th mainland passenger aircraft commandeered to 
Taiwan since last April. 
  Hung also called on the military to step up air security. 
Some government officials here believe that Beijing may be 
using the hijackings to test Taiwan's air defense capability, 
though no sophisticated electronic devices designed to collect 
military information have been found on any hijacked aircraft. 
  Shen, however, remained concerned about the possibility of 
such a scheme. He said he could not figure out why Mainland 
China's air security personnel had yielded to hijackers equipped 
with "the most ludicrous hijacking weapons in the world." 
  In Friday's case, Lin Wenqiang, 36, hijacked a Southwest 
China Airlines Boeing 737 to the island with a knife and a glass 
filled with tissue paper, which Lin claimed was an explosive. 
  Shen and Hung also asked the government to press mainland 
authorities to strengthen flight security checks and step up 
their anti-air piracy publicity campaign.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb 18 (AFP)--Taiwan prosecutors said 
Friday they would recommend heavy punishment for a Chinese man 
who allegedly diverted a China Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 
here. 
  "Hijacking is a serious crime under international law, and 
we 
will ask that the court hand down severe punishment against the 
alleged hijacker," Lin Chieh-teh, chief of Taoyuan Prosecutor's 
Office, told reporters here. He said Lin Wenqiang had been 
arrested and detained by the office pending legal action here. 
Under local law, the maximum penalty for hijacking is life 
imprisonment. 
  Huang Hui-ho, deputy director of the Civil Aeronautics 
Administration, asked China to further tighten its airport 
security to prevent future cases from ocurring. "They must 
search the suspicious passengers, regardless whether they are 
police or not, before allowing them to board the plane," he 
said, referring to Lin's disguising himself as a police officer. 
  Lin, 36 (eds: correct), impersonated a military police 
officer, and ordered the crew of the Chinese airliner with 130 
people on board, including eight crew, to change course when the 
plane was on a domestic flight from Changsha to the coastal city 
of Fuzhou. 
  Lin, a business manager at a state-run company in Changsha, 
Hunan province, brought his foster mother, wife, and two sons 
aged 9 and 11 with him. 
  Lin was arrested after he surrendered to police when the 
plane touched down at Taiwan's international airport at 10:43 
a.m. (0243 GMT). All passengers, including Lin's family and the 
crew, were returned to Fuzhou via Hong Kong four hours later. 
  "I used a fake military police ID which I obtained through a 
friend to board the plane," Lin told reporters before being 
taken to the prosecutor's office, explaining why the airport 
personnel did not search him. 
  Lin used a knife and a fake bomb to make the pilot fly to 
Taiwan, Huang said. The bomb turned out to be a lid cup stuffed 
with toilet paper. The hijacker showed a crew member a piece of 
paper that said: "I want to hijack the plane to Taiwan. If you 
come close to me, I will blast off the plane," Huang said. 
  Lin said he had planned the hijacking since October last 
year. "I had been prosecuted [as received] by the communists ... 
and wanted to come here," he said, adding he was aware that 
hijacking was a crime in Taiwan. 
  The incident was the 11th in ten months, and the first this 
year. A total of 15 suspects were involved in the hijacking of 
Chinese airliners to Taiwan last year. 
  The issue has become a new source of friction between Taiwan 
and China. 
  The two sides have remained rivals since the 1949 Chinese 
civil war after which the defeated Nationalists fled to Taiwan. 
Both governments claim sovereignty over all of China. 
  Represented by their semi-official agencies, the two sides 
began negotiations in Beijing in August 1993. Although the two 
sides held three rounds of talks, no conclusion on the 
repatriation of the hijackers was reached. 
  China has strongly demanded the return of hijackers, but 
Taiwan insists it has the jurisdiction to handle the cases and 
try the hijackers here. 
  Taiwan has so far sentenced six of the 15 hijackers to jail 
terms ranging from six to ten years.

<F P=106> [News conference by Premier Lien Chan with foreign and </F>
domestic correspondents at the Government Information Office in 
Taipei on 4 February] 
  [Text] Yesterday, Executive Yuan President Lien Chan held 
a year-end news conference at which he answered 17 questions 
raised by domestic and foreign correspondents; the news 
conference lasted 65 minutes. 
  In response to relevant questions, Premier Lien noted: To 
develop cross-strait relations, the two sides should assume a 
pragmatic and rational attitude and seek common ground despite 
the fact that the country is divided and administered 
separately; otherwise, it will be hard for the hope for 
favorable interaction to materialize. On the Chiao-Tang talks 
currently underway on the mainland, Premier Lien emphasized: 
Instead of merely stating their positions, the two sides should 
adopt a problem-solving approach during the talks. At present, 
we must patiently confront differences that may arise, maintain 
our basic positions, and continue our efforts. 
  Lien Chan, who has been in office for nearly a year, also 
fielded questions raised by correspondents on the mainland, 
internal affairs, foreign affairs, financial affairs, and 
constitutional reforms. The following is what happened at the 
news conference: 
  Accompanied by Li Hou-kao, secretary general of the 
Executive 
Yuan, and Hu Chih-chiang, director general of the Government 
Information Office, Lien Chan entered the site of the news 
conference at 0830 GMT. He first extended New Year's greetings 
to the correspondents present and thanked the people in all 
circles for their efforts to encourage and supervise his cabinet 
over the past year. Thereafter, he began the hour-long news 
conference. 
  [Correspondent] Building Taiwan into an Asia-Pacific 
business hub is currently the government's major plan. Planning 
is quite complete in this regard. Mr. Premier, would you please 
explain all the specifics? Moreover, Taiwan cannot possibly 
exclude Communist China if it becomes a free trade area as a 
result of this plan. The question of direct shipping and air 
services between designated areas on the two sides of the Taiwan 
Strait will also be raised. Mr. Premier, what are your views on 
this matter? 
  [Lien Chan] The Asia-Pacific region achieved an average 
economic growth rate of 4.5 percent in recent years, which was 
the fastest economic growth in the world over the past few 
years. Its total output of goods and services represented about 
half the world's total output. The region is bound to become 
the focus of the world economy in the future. 
  The Republic of China [ROC] on Taiwan has the following 
advantages to become an Asia-Pacific business hub: 1) an 
excellent geographical environment; 2) excellent economic 
conditions; 3) ample and high-quality manpower; and 4) 
abundant capital markets. The government hopes to complete 
planning as soon as possible. It is expected that planning will 
be completed by the middle of this year. 
  Why should we so actively promote the ROC as a business hub? 
This is because, aside from the two traditional Asian business 
hubs of Hong Kong and Singapore, Japan's Osaka, Shanghai's 
Putung [Pudong] in Mainland China, Australia's Sydney, and New 
Zealand all are making similar preparations and attempts. Even 
Subic in the Philippines hopes for a piece of the action. We 
must work against time; otherwise, we will lose our development 
opportunities in three to five years. To be sure, we must also 
strengthen local construction. For example, our public 
facilities are still inadequate. That is why we proposed the 12 
construction projects to beef up our public facilities. Also, 
we should make great efforts to supplement our financial and 
legal systems with legislative work. 
<H3>  We Cannot Consider Things on Purely Economic Grounds; the 
Time Is Not Ripe for Direct Cross-Strait Shipping and Air 
Services </H3>
  With regard to direct air and shipping services between 
designated areas on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, the 
government has always placed importance on the question of the 
three cross-strait exchanges [mail, shipping and air services, 
and trade], listing them as long- and medium-range goals in the 
National Unification Program. We hope to attain these goals to 
facilitate economic and social development on both sides of the 
Taiwan Strait. Politically speaking, however, we must reach a 
common understanding with Communist China on treating us as an 
equal political entity, renouncing the use of armed force 
against us, and allowing us room for developing international 
relations before we can further discuss the question of three 
exchanges. Otherwise, the time is not ripe for solving complex 
problems within a purely economic context by initiating direct 
air and shipping services between designated areas on the two 
sides of the Taiwan Strait. 
  In reality, Communist China, in its white paper on Taiwan 
released last year, maintained that we should obtain their 
consent prior to signing any agreements on shipping and air 
rights with other countries. If cross-strait shipping and air 
services can be considered on purely economic grounds, why did 
Communist China's white paper contain such a statement? 
Personally, I do not think the time is ripe for direct shipping 
and air services between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. 
  [Correspondent] A final decision on the plan for 
readjusting the pay of military, government, and educational 
personnel in 1995 is imminent. People are very concerned. 
Premier, would you please give us a clear explanation in this 
regard? 
  [Lien] This matter is to be settled at a final meeting 
scheduled for Saturday [5 February]. However, I would like to 
take advantage of this rare opportunity to offer some specific 
explanations. 
  Pay readjustment for military, government, and educational 
personnel is a policy matter about which the government is very 
concerned. We have to take into consideration the government's 
financial capacity, inflation indexes, the competitiveness of 
the private-sector, and the material well-being and morale of 
government employees. The consumer price index, which rose 2.9 
percent last year, is expected to rise 3.4 percent this year. 
Therefore, a raise of about 3 percent should be appropriate. 
The Personnel Administrative Bureau has submitted two plans. 
Personally, I am inclined to adopt the 3-percent raise in 
drafting the budget. 
  [Correspondent] What are your expectations of the ongoing 
talks in Peiking [Beijing] on routine affairs between the 
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits [ARATS] and 
the Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF]? If the two sides are 
unable to reach agreement on some routine issues after extended 
discussions, will the government consider modifying its mainland 
policy? Will this lead even to a reduction in cross-strait 
exchanges? 
  [Lien] SEF-ARATS discussions on routine affairs constitute a 
link of our overall policy toward the mainland. Today, 
development of cross-strait relations depends on the two sides 
taking a pragmatic and reasonable approach toward the reality of 
a divided nation and divided rules and seeking a common ground 
from this reality. Without such an understanding, a relation of 
constructive mutual engagement [liang xing hu dong 5328 1840 
0062 0520] between the two sides will remain unattainable. 
  The current SEF mission left for the mainland in the hope of 
following up on the five understandings reached at the Ku-Wang 
talks and reaching an agreement. We will certainly welcome any 
agreement on fishing disputes or repatriation of hijackers and 
people who illegally enter Taiwan that is reached at the ongoing 
talks in Peiping. Certainly, some of these issues require us to 
tackle them with patience. 
  [Correspondent] Presidential adviser Li Kuo-ting 
recently questioned the feasibility of the plan for building an 
east-west superhighway. What do you think of such 
criticism? 
  [Lien] We should indeed care about government finances. Not 
only those in the government but people at large should show 
concern. When I assumed office last year, the government debt 
stood at NT$1,060 billion [new Taiwan dollars] and the balance 
in the annual budget was a mere NT$100 million; the situation 
was extremely difficult. We took a variety of emergency 
measures, and, as a result, the budget deficit has dropped to 
NT$84.9 billion and the balance in the annual budget has risen 
to NT$23.3 billion. However, because the universal health 
insurance services that will come into effect this year, the 
budget for public welfare spending for 1994 will double that of 
last year. This, plus a pay raise of military, government, and 
educational personnel, increased budgetary spending on education 
and science and weaponry purchases; there probably will be a 
NT$400 billion shortfall in this year's budget. 
  The government must also take the whole situation in 
consideration. On one hand, it must reduce spending, halt 
inappropriate public investment, and reduce waste; on the other 
hand, it must seriously consider all projects -- such as those 
for developing towns and cities and for regional balance -- that 
have a direct bearing on the people. Therefore, the east-west 
superhighway was given emphasis in the Six-Year National 
Development Plan. Often, only 60 percent of six-year plans are 
completed. Therefore, proper emphasis on priority projects will 
have a positive impact on national development and economic 
growth. 
  In response to calls from various quarters, the provincial 
government undertook, seven or eight years ago, a study and 
adopted the highway project. A feasibility study of the 
east-west superhighway project was conducted in 1990 and a 
project assessment was made in 1993. There is a thick file of 
materials about the two studies. Everyone is welcome to look 
through it. 
  More assessment will be needed in regard to the project's 
environmental impact and financing. When all the conditions -- 
environment, financing, technical capability, and private-sector 
participation -- are in place, we should push forward with this 
project. 
  [Correspondent] The idea of "two China's as a phase" 
forwarded by Economics Minister Chiang Ping-kun at the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] meeting has won 
widespread approval. I would like to know how would you, the 
premier, advance this policy in the future? 
  [Lien] The one-China policy is the nation's fundamental 
policy, but China is currently divided. The ROC is a sovereign 
nation founded in 1912, but currently the ROC holds the power of 
rule only over Taiwan, Penghu, Matsu, and Chinmen. This is the 
general environment, the fundamental reality. We believe that, 
realistically speaking, discussion of the sovereignty issue 
should be put aside at the present stage when considering the 
issues relating to foreign affairs and mainland policy. What 
should be done is to move forward step by step in the light of 
reality. 
  The APEC meeting was an economic occasion, not a government 
occasion. Therefore, no politically sensitive question should 
be broached there. Unfortunately, the Chinese Communists had 
the impudence to call our Taiwan a PRC province. Minister 
Chiang's statement was a tactical explanation to tell people 
that the reality is not what Chinese Communists claim. That was 
a tactical explanation made at a given circumstances and 
occasion. 
  [Correspondent] In the past, we said that politics 
should be separated from economics in our policy toward the 
mainland. Will this policy be continued? If a policy of not 
separating politics and economics is adopted, what chips does 
the government have to make the businessmen abide by such a 
policy? Thank you. 
  [Lien] Separating economics from politics -- I do not know 
whose idea this is. In regard to the overall situation 
vis-a-vis the mainland, I believe we should continue to take the 
National Reunification Guidelines as the supreme guidance and 
policy. It is a fact that our businessmen are investing in all 
sectors of the mainland's economy and we are trading indirectly. 
The mainland has seen rapid growth in the past few years, 
registering economic growth rates from 9 to as high as 14 
percent. However, can such high rates be sustained for long? 
This is a question that merits consideration. Shortages of 
public facilities and strong inflationary pressures are, in 
particular, factors that we should consider from an economic 
angle. In addition to economic risks, there is no denying the 
fact that all economic activities in the mainland carry some 
political risks, even high political risks. Nowadays, with 
regard to economic activities in the mainland, the government is 
more inclined to give guidance than issue prohibitions. 
However, we do not encourage such activities. Our approach is 
an incremental and indirect one. We do not want to place all 
our economic strength in one basket; the preservation and 
development of Taiwan's economic strength should be the guiding 
principle governing all our economic activities. I made a trip 
to Southeast Asia recently. Economics departments have also 
come up with the so-called southern policy. Our investment in 
Southeast Asia stands at about $15 billion today; imports from 
that region accounts for about 11 percent while exports account 
for 32 percent of the ROC's total exports. It is a very 
important region. 
<H3>  The Southern Policy Is Based on Pragmatism; More Efforts 
Will Be Needed To Break Out of Our Diplomatic Predicament </H3>
  [Correspondent] What is your view of the practice of 
"vacation diplomacy"? Are there plans for overseas trips for 
other cabinet members? 
  [Lien] The primary consideration behind my visit to 
Southeast Asia and the subsequent announcement of the "southern 
policy" is the fact that the ROC has an investment of $15 
billion in that region, which also accounts for 32 percent of 
the ROC's exports. With the exception of Thailand, we have 
signed agreements with all countries in that region on 
investment protection and protection against double taxation. 
We have close ties with them. We hope to participate more in 
Southeast Asian organizations meetings and activities. All in 
all, we must not look at only the regional and functional 
aspects in considering issues related to the "southern policy." 
  I made a trip to Southeast Asia not long ago primarily 
because it was New Year's and I had some days off. I went to 
Malaysia and Singapore and met their government leaders. The 
trip to Honduras was an official diplomatic mission ordered by 
the president. The government is facing great difficulties in 
diplomacy. I always feel that we should make our voice heard by 
our friends and the world at large. We also hope to make our 
strength, good will, contributions, and ideas heard and seen by 
all the people. 
  As long as resources permit, I am all for the idea that 
relevant government personnel should turn up more frequently in 
different locations and at different international occasions to 
publicize our nation. That is what you reporters call "show up 
faces." As a matter of fact, we have to show up to let 
everybody know that we did not vanish; rather we are growing in 
strength with each passing day. I think it is very important. 
  [Correspondent] Where do you think our mainland 
policy will go in a post-Teng Hsiao-ping [Deng Xiaoping] era? 
Hsu Chia-tun [Xu Jiatun], former director of the Hong Kong 
branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, said that under Li Teng-hui's 
strong leadership, the chance of peaceful reunification of China 
seems to be dwindling. What is your view? 
  [Lien] I have said many times that people across the strait 
are, fundamentally speaking, compatriots and siblings related by 
blood and flesh. There are no deep seated hatred or absolute 
irreconcilability between people of the two sides. What we are 
trying to do today is to create for the entire Chinese nation a 
free, stable, and prosperous future. Such a basic standpoint is 
accepted by all. 
  We can look forward to the nation's future, including 
unification. As a matter of fact, a politician's life is short, 
but a nation's life is forever. 
  I believe cross-strait relations should not be based on the 
ideas of a life-or-death struggle, or on the big consuming the 
small, or suffocating the other side at every turn. This would 
not be unification but annexation. A unification should be the 
merging of two to work together for the development of the 
nation. 
  The present Chinese Communist leader should, while he still 
commands tremendous authority, make a historic decision with a 
historical vision and lofty sentiments. That would be positive 
to the development of the nation. 
  [Correspondent] You have been premier for almost a 
year. Can you tell us the policies you are most and least 
satisfied with? 
  [Lien] In the past year, myself and the heads of the various 
ministries have worked in unity and devoted ourselves to public 
service. We have worked very hard to implement administrative 
renovation and economic rejuvenation. All these policies 
involve fundamental and structural issues. We do our best to 
reach a consensus. I have had the office for just 11 months. 
These policies were announced only last June or July. They 
have been implemented for a short time. However, all the signs 
indicate that all these policies are moving efficiently toward 
their goals and targets. 
  We have also done a great deal of work with regard to public 
security, environmental protection, agriculture, communications, 
and so forth. Administrative departments always want to 
accelerate the pace of implementation. We hope that legislative 
organs will support us by enacting relevant laws. When the laws 
are in place, administrative departments will be able to take 
bold and resolute actions to implement them. 
<H3>  The Cabinet Will Be Partly Reshuffled After the Lunar New 
Year; the Question of Candidates Cannot Be Determined Now </H3>
  [Correspondent] The "Chiao-Tang talks" somehow show 
that the higher the level of talks, the greater the efficiency. 
Communist China apparently wants to upgrade the talks. What 
are your views on this development and what are our future 
policy directions? 
  [Lien] In my opinion, the five joint agreements reached 
during last year's "Ku-Wang talks" should be implemented 
quickly. Regrettably, no progress was made on implementation 
after that, whether during the talks in Amoy, Peiking, or Taipei. 
  I am very doubtful that this problem can be solved by 
upgrading the talks. Basically, I think crucial problems remain 
between the two sides. We must patiently solve fishing disputes 
and the problem of repatriating airplane hijackers and illegal 
immigrants across the Taiwan Strait. 
  I have a demand, though: We should proceed while maintaining 
the nation's basic positions. As for matters other than those 
affecting our basic positions, we can make readjustments or 
adopt a flexible approach. 
  [Correspondent] Recently, there have been many reports 
that the cabinet may be partially reshuffled. Can you explain 
or clarify the matter? 
  [Lien] As I said before, everybody has been serving the 
country faithfully, contributing wholeheartedly, and remaining 
on good terms in the 11 months since I began serving in the 
cabinet. However, a few colleagues will not be able to continue 
their service for personal reasons or for reasons of family. I 
think we will make proper readjustments after the Lunar New Year. 
  As for candidates, since the Law on Provincial and County 
Autonomy, the Law on Autonomy for Cities Directly Under the 
Central Government, and the Law on Election and Recall have been 
submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation after 
Executive Yuan approval, we will hold gubernatorial and mayoral 
elections toward year's end if the legislative process is 
completed by the end of June. Perhaps there is a lot of 
guesswork out there. I do not think we can make specific 
decisions before the legislative process is completed. 
  [Correspondent] Judging by the property declarations 
filed by public servants, we understand that you have 17 types 
of stocks. The Executive Yuan has decided to collect a capital 
gains tax. Since some other government leaders also possess 
stocks, will this policy of collecting a capital gain tax affect 
the stock market or even smack of serving one's own interests? 
Will this lead to a situation where the "referee is also the 
ball player"? 
  [Lien] With regard to the stock transaction and capital 
gains taxes, the Legislative Yuan passed a resolution in 1992 in 
which it urged the government to make a decision at the earliest 
possible date. After hearing a briefing on the Finance 
Ministry's bill of amendments and the opinions of other 
ministries and commissions, the Executive Yuan concluded that 
the collection of such taxes would mark progress in terms of tax 
revenue, fairness in taxation, and simplified auditing and 
taxation procedures. It held discussions and adopted the bill 
accordingly. 
  A rapidly developing country will inevitably incur several 
problems in implementing financial, taxation, banking, land, and 
housing policies; and timely reviews of those policies are in 
order. Nevertheless, the government's policies are primarily 
based on national development and the interests of all people. 
  [Correspondent] The Presidential Office and the 
Executive Yuan appeared to be on very harmonious terms during 
the past year. What do you think were the reasons? Was it 
because of institutional or individual factors? Since direct 
presidential elections are the main purpose of the third round 
of constitutional reforms, how do you think the duties of the 
president and the premier should be divided after the 
introduction of popular elections of the president? 
  [Lien] The duties of the president and the premier are 
specified in very explicit terms in our Constitution. Because 
the president is the head of state, his guidance and leadership 
should be respected, especially on major national security 
policies such as foreign affairs, national defense, and mainland 
policies. During the past year, the Executive Yuan implemented 
many policies after they were discussed and assembled at high 
levels of the government. 
  Constitutional reforms will temporarily come to an end. The 
National Assembly will meet in April to decide on outstanding 
constitutional matters. In my opinion, what happens to the 
presidential duties will depend on how such duties are designed. 
Direct presidential elections will lead to presidential systems 
in some countries, but the presidents of some countries are 
still not responsible for actual administrative duties despite 
the introduction of direct presidential elections. Our 
constitutional system is based on the division of power among 
five branches. The best way is to introduce necessary 
amendments to this system. I believe that experiences and 
precedents in constitutional rule over the past 40 years will 
serve as a guide in the future. 
  [Correspondent] Lawmakers from the Kuomintang recently 
urged the government to allocate lawmakers' shares of budget 
funds for infrastructure construction. What are your views on 
this proposal? 
  [Lien] I used to serve in local government. My basic 
position is that the government does allocate some part of its 
annual budget for local construction projects. For example, the 
provincial government has different budget plans, such as those 
for local construction projects and for coordinating local 
needs. These are all for the benefit of local construction. 
People's representatives may make suggestions. Relevant 
ministries and commissions will give full consideration to these 
suggestions and decide whether they fit into the overall plan. 
This is our basic approach. It was how things stood during the 
three years I was with the provincial government. Suggestions 
made by people's representatives should be considered in order 
of importance and urgency. The right to decide whether or not 
to adopt those suggestions rests with the executive branch 
because it will be responsible for implementing budget plans and 
spending in the future. 
<H3>  We Have Conducted an Overview of Malpractices in Arms 
Purchases; We Will Focus on Tightening Budgetary Control </H3>
  [Correspondent] Yin Ching-feng's murder has revealed 
many problems regarding arms purchases. Do government 
departments have overall plans for reforming the practice of 
buying weapons? 
  [Lien] The problems with our arms purchases have caused 
widespread concern. Relevant departments have made timely 
reports in this regard. The Defense Ministry and other relevant 
units have begun to conduct an overview of problems stemming 
from purchasing malpractices. An arms purchase improvement 
package will be unveiled in the near future. We will focus on 
tightening control over budget utilization and on eliminating 
thorny problems in the process. However, we can only say this 
much because the Yin case has entered the judicial and 
investigative stage. The government will draw lessons and gain 
experience from this incident, and it will study the best 
methods for bringing about improvements. 
  [Correspondent] Along with presidential election 
methods, the premier's countersigning right is also one of the 
main subjects of the third round of constitutional reforms. You 
once said that the National Assembly's decisions on 
constitutional reforms should be respected. Aside from 
deferring to the National Assembly's opinions, do you think the 
premier's countersigning right should be readjusted? And how 
should we readjust it? 
  [Lien] I think the premier's countersigning right could and 
should be readjusted because it is indeed unreasonable in some 
respects. For example, the premier still has to countersign 
decrees that affect him personally, as well as personnel matters 
involving administrative officers over which the National 
Assembly has already exercised its right of consent. It is all 
the more unreasonable when formality requires the premier to 
countersign the appointments of civil servants at the 
grass-roots level, although he does not know whose appointment 
he is countersigning because there are thousands of them. While 
the premier should have the right of countersigning things, this 
right should be clearly defined, either by outlining matters 
requiring his countersignature or by eliminating those that do 
not require his countersignature. The right of countersigning 
things should not extend without limits, as it does now. We 
should be able to readjust it. 
  [Correspondent] In the 1995 administrative guidelines 
you submitted to the Legislative Yuan, you described this year 
as crucial for bridging the past and the future. You expressed 
your hopes that Taiwan would take an active part in 
international activities or bid for hosting international 
events. Do you have concrete plans for realizing these hopes? 
Also, there has been a steady stream of criticisms against our 
country for engaging in "checkbook diplomacy" at a time when it 
is actively expanding its niche in the international community. 
What are your views on these criticisms? 
  [Lien] This matter involves several issues. Only a few of 
the international conferences we plan to host this year are of 
an official nature due to our country's status. However, we can 
host many nongovernmental international events. For example, 
the International Rotary Club's plan to hold a large-scale event 
in Taipei, to be attended by 30,000 people, will afford us 
excellent opportunities because participants will be given to 
understand the ROC's progress. Other international events 
include our bid for hosting the East Asian Games and the Asian 
Games. However, these events require the host cities to 
undertake some obligations in advance, and the central 
government is prepared to cooperate fully. For this reason, most 
of our national construction plans concern the construction of 
sports facilities. With regard to so-called "checkbook 
diplomacy," Minister Chien has made our stand very clear over 
the past few days: Our approach toward developing bilateral 
relations is based on the spirit of mutual assistance, mutual 
benefit, and reciprocity. Criticism by people outside the 
government that the latter is engaging in "checkbook diplomacy" 
is very unfair. 
  In reality, economic, agricultural, and technical 
cooperation 
is our bargaining chip for expanding our diplomatic activities. 
This is something all countries can do openly. Why do people 
not criticize what the Chinese Communists do? Our situation is 
already difficult enough. I feel great sympathy for Foreign 
Minister Chien and his subordinates. They are really working 
hard, and people should encourage them.

<F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>
  [Text] Fierce regional opposition has forced Beijing to 
back down on a controversial new land tax, the first time it has 
bent to local demands since a new national tax system was 
introduced earlier this year. 
  A senior official at the State Administration of Taxation in 
Beijing said the detailed regulations of the tax on capital 
gains on land sales--due out in late February or early 
March--would differ significantly from the central government's 
original announcement of the basic tax law last month. 
  "New problems came up when we talked with Guangdong and 
other 
provinces about this, [so] adjustments will be made to take 
account of their views," he said. 
  But the official denied statements by provincial authorities 
in Guangdong and Shanghai suggesting the tax may be delayed for 
one or two years. 
  "I have heard this, but it is not correct. The State Council 
has already announced the tax, so it cannot be reversed," he 
said. 
  Coastal regions have given Beijing an earful about its plans 
to levy the new tax, which would have assessed real estate 
investment profits at rates of 30 to 60 per cent under the 
original scheme. 
  Even though local governments would have retained all the 
proceeds, there was concern that the tax would drive away 
foreign investment. 
  "The tax was too high. We told the central government this 
was not correct," said Liang Yixi, deputy director of the 
Guangdong Provincial Land Bureau. 
  Beijing finally backed down on implementation of the new tax 
only after numerous meetings with provincial leaders, Liang 
said. "The local role will be increased," she said. 
  Shanghai's mayor, Huang Ju, had made at least two trips to 
Beijing to protest against the tax in the past month, an 
official at the municipal Foreign Investment Commission said. 
  "There have been too many complaints. The central government 
could not just carry on," he said. 
  Details of the centre's retreat have been leaked to foreign 
economists and property consultants in the past few weeks as 
Beijing sought to allay the unease of foreign investors. 
  "The new regulations will be much more relaxed," said Chen 
Xingdong, chief economist for Crosby Securities in Beijing. 
  Chen said the changes would probably allow developers to 
deduct interest charges and inflation from their capital gains. 
  Gains of under 20 or 30 per cent would also be exempted from 
the tax, Chen said. In addition, local governments would be 
allowed to exempt certain types of property developments. 
  But Beijing would not change the basic rate of the new tax 
or 
the January 1 implementation date, Chen said. 
  "This would show their inability to manage," he said. 
  Local governments will also be allowed to rebate a 
significant portion of the tax to developers in certain 
circumstances, according to Harry Chan of the property 
consultants Francis Lau &amp; Co in Hong Kong. 
  "We were told by Beijing that local governments will be 
given 
a lot of decision-making power in order to soften the effects," 
he said. 
  The backdown on the land tax is a blow to the central 
government, which was counting on it to boost local revenues in 
compensation for taking a larger share of the total fiscal pie 
under the new national tax system. 
  Only weeks ago the Minister of Finance, Liu Zhongli, stated 
publicly that any adjustments or modifications to the tax made 
by local authorities would be considered invalid. 
  "Local governments have no choice but to obey the 
regulations 
laid down by the central government," Liu said.

<F P=106> [XINHUA "Mailbox": "What Is a Listed Company?"] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 11 Feb (XINHUA) -- What is a listed 
company? A listed company is a company which is approved to 
issue and list its stocks for trading on a stock exchange. 
  A listed company must be a limited liability stock company. 
However, not all limited liability stock companies are listed 
companies. This is because a limited liability stock company 
must meet certain requirements, and go through screening and 
approving formalities according to prescribed procedures before 
it can become a listed company. 
  Specific listing requirements for a company differ from 
country to country. For example, the listing requirements for a 
company stipulated by the New York Stock Exchange are: The 
company's pretax profits shall not be less than $2.5 million for 
the most recent year and shall not be less than $2 million a 
year for the most recent two years; its tangible assets shall 
not be less than $16 million; the market value of its publicly 
held stocks shall not be less than $16 million; and at least 1 
million shares of its stocks are publicly held and 2,000 
stockholders hold more than 100 shares of its stock. 
  China has also conducted experiments to list limited 
liability stock companies on the stock market. With approval, a 
stock exchange was set up in Shanghai and Shenzhen in December 
1990 and July 1991, respectively. At the same time, eight 
limited liability stock companies were listed in Shanghai and 
six were listed in Shenzhen. With the deepening of reform, more 
companies have been listed on the stock exchanges, and the 
experimental work has become more standardized. By November 
1993, 157 companies had been listed, 97 on the Shanghai Stock 
Exchange and 60 on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. 
  The listing requirements for a company stipulated by the 
Shanghai Stock Exchange are: The company must be one registered 
with the department of administration for industry and commerce; 
its paid-up capital shall not be less than 5 million yuan in 
Renminbi; the amount of the company's stocks issued to the 
general public shall not be less than 25 percent of its paid-up 
capital; the number of registered stocks shall not be fewer than 
500; the company has earned profits for the two latest 
consecutive years; it has the recommendation of at least one 
Shanghai Stock Exchange member; it has set up an office in 
Shanghai municipal district for transactions [guo hu 6665 2073]; 
and it has published its financial situation regularly in at 
least one publicly circulated newspaper or periodical. 
  The listing requirements for a company stipulated by the 
Shenzhen Stock Exchange are: The company must be an approved 
limited liability stock company newly established or established 
through reorganization; its production line and business conform 
with Shenzhen City's industrial policy (for companies registered 
in Shenzhen; companies registered in other places must conform 
with the state's industrial policy); the company is in good 
standing in terms of production and business performance, with 
net assets not less than 10 million yuan; the net value of its 
tangible assets shall not be less than 25 percent of the total 
value of its tangible assets in the year preceding listing 
application; the founder's subscribed stocks shall not be less 
than 5 million yuan and not less than 35 percent of the total 
amount of the company's stocks; the amount of stocks issued to 
nonspecific individuals through public offering shall not be 
less than 25 percent of the total amount of the capital stocks 
and the number of stockholders shall not be fewer than 800; and 
there are no records showing that the company has violated the 
law or harmed the public interests in the most recent three 
years. 
  Since 1992, with the approval of authorized state 
departments, nine large state-owned enterprises -- Shanghai 
Petrochemical General Plant, Qingdao Beer Plant, Beijing 
People's Machinery Plant, Guangzhou Shipyard, Maanshan Steel 
Company, Kunming Machine-Building Plant, Dongfang 
Electric-Machinery Plant, Tianjin Bohai Petrochemical (Group) 
Company, Yizheng Chemical Fiber (Group) Company -- have 
undergone reorganization to become limited liability stock 
companies and made other preparations for listing according to 
the agreement reached between departments concerned and the Hong 
Kong Joint Stock Exchange. The first five companies completed 
listing formalities and became listed companies in the Hong Kong 
Joint Stock Exchange in 1993.

<F P=106> [XINHUA "Mailbox": "What Is a Market System?"] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 12 Feb (XINHUA) -- In a market economy, a 
market system is an economic system created by an 
omnidirectional, mutually dependent, and open commodity market 
and a production-factor market. 
  A market system is an organic and interrelated whole 
composed 
of various markets; it requires not only a commodity market, but 
also various kinds of production-factor market needed for 
reproduction as well as various kinds of visible and invisible 
product market to provide the services needed in the daily life 
of citizens. These include commodity markets, financial 
markets, labor markets, technology markets, information markets, 
real estate markets, and cultural markets. A commodity market 
may be further divided into consumption markets and means of 
production markets. 
  In a developed commodity market and a market economy in 
which 
the exchange of commodities and production factors is conducted 
through the market, exchange is carried out according to the 
market economy's internal connections and through the law of 
market, the law of supply and demand, and the law of 
competition, and is not restricted by administrative rules and 
regulations. Various markets in the system may be divided into 
different types based on different factors. According to 
economic factors, they may be divided into consumption product 
markets and production-factor markets; according to the type of 
product, they may be divided into material products markets and 
nonmaterial markets; according to the scope of the market, they 
may be divided into regional markets, national markets, and 
international markets; according to the sale time lag, they may 
be divided into spot markets and futures markets; and according 
to the role and function of the product in the course of 
production, they may be divided into finished-product markets 
and capital markets. 
  A market system embodies colossal subordinate market 
systems. 
There are three of them. They are: A market structure system, 
a main market system, and a market regulatory and control 
system. An omnidirectional, unified, and open market system is 
the premise for achieving effective allocation of resources; it 
is also a result of a gradual development of an imperfect market 
system. 
  For a large part of the microeconomy in market operations, 
the role of the market system is to serve as a link in 
establishing a point of contact for the various principal parts 
of the economy; it also serves as a stage on which the vitality 
of the principal parts of the microeconomy are brought into play 
and displayed; and it creates the major conditions for 
rationalizing the behavior of the principal parts of the 
microeconomy. Seen on a macroeconomic level, the role of the 
market system is manifested in its service as a foundation on 
which to build and perfect a macroeconomic regulation and 
control system; in the creation of important conditions for 
realizing the goals of macroeconomic regulation and control; and 
in giving play to the effectiveness of macroeconomic regulation 
and control. In the course of building a market economic 
system, the state must not only remold and foster the principal 
parts of the microeconomy and give them corresponding 
responsibility, rights, and benefits in the functioning of the 
market system, it should also nurture a sound and open market 
system in a planned manner. 
  The functioning of a socialist market economy calls for the 
creation of an omnidirectional market system. Only with a sound 
market system is it possible for the market to fully bring into 
play its effective regulatory role in the economic operation of 
the entire society. As a rule, an omnidirectional market system 
can be described and explained by the time lag arising from a 
change of hands between market objects and exchanged objects in 
the market. Therefore, the omnidirectional market system 
testifies to and explains the soundness of the market in 
socio-economical development from different angles; it 
intrinsically constitutes the completeness and perfection of the 
market. Therefore, in the course of building a socialist market 
economic system, it is necessary to vigorously nurture and help 
form an omnidirectional market system.

<F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Profits Rise 62 Percent"] </F>
  [Text] China's industry generated 145 billion yuan ($16.9 
billion) in profits last year, representing growth of more than 
62 per cent over the previous year. 
  And last year's sales were 42 per cent up on 1992, the State 
Statistics Bureau said yesterday. 
  Encouraged by the rise in profits and sales, Chinese 
factories have been busy gearing up industrial production since 
the beginning of the year, according to bureau economists. 
  Output in January this year jumped by more than 33 per cent 
over the same period last year. 
  The bureau has not released sales and profits for this 
January. But January's sales of finished products were 1.3 per 
cent up on the corresponding month in the previous year. 
  However, the loss-making factories which are sitting on 
large 
amounts of raw materials and stocks still pose a big headache 
for China's industrial development. 
  Most loss-making factories are State-owned enterprises. 
  And over one quarter of firms in the State-dominated heavy 
industry sector reported operating losses last year. 
  The performance of these loss-makers was considered 
particularly poor given that more than 68 per cent of last 
year's profits were generated by heavy industry. 
  Industry will have to improve efficiency as well as gear up 
production, according to the bureau. 
  Industrial production should slow down a bit this year due 
to 
the government's brakes-on industrial development policy, which 
aims to safeguard the health of the national economy. 
  The central government's targeted growth of industrial 
production should be slightly above 20 per cent this year, which 
is essential for ensuring a 9 per cent of GDP growth in China, 
official sources say. 
  The bureau also said that the industrial production in 
coastal areas is better than that of the country's land-locked 
regions. 
  Industrial enterprises in East China's coastal Shandong 
Province topped last year's output and sales league in the 
country. 
  However, Shanxi Province, a major coal producer in North 
China, came bottom, according to the bureau.

  [Text] Beijing, Feb 18 (AFP)--Some 1,783 coal mines in 
northeastern China have been closed amid concern about the 
growing number of fatal accidents there, the China Business 
Times reported Friday. 
  The report blamed Heilongjiang province's Jixi city mining 
accidents on poor management and said the mines would be 
reorganised. The report did not say when or whether the 
Manchurian mines would reopen. 
  In addition, mine safety would be increased, the newspaper 
said. 
  Officials who do not properly understand mining or 
management 
and inadequately trained technical staff and miners will be 
replaced, the report said, adding that women employed 
underground will not remain in those jobs. 
  Emphasis will be put on upgrading safety equipment, the 
newspaper said. 
  Northeastern China is the centre of the country's coal 
mining 
industry, where dismal safety standards cause large numbers of 
accidents and fatalities. 
  In the final week of January alone, 155 people died in a 
series of deadly gas explosions in coal mines. The worst 
accident killed 99 miners. 
  Labour and coal officials held an emergency meeting early 
this month after the spate of accidents. 
  The worst safety conditions are in the thousands of small, 
private operations that have mushroomed across the country and 
hired workers from the countryside without properly training 
them, the newspaper said.

"Quicken the Pace of Optimizing the Iron and Steel Industrial 
Structure"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 11 Feb (XINHUA) -- At a recent national 
metallurgical work conference, Metallurgical Industry Minister 
Liu Qi devoted a substantial portion of his work report to 
admonishing people in the iron and steel industry not to miss 
the current, favorable opportunity to quicken the pace of 
optimizing the iron and steel industrial structure. 
  Liu Qi's admonition contains this message: China should not 
be merely content with its status as an iron and steel power but 
should redouble its efforts to narrow the gap with advanced 
world levels in iron and steel production, and become a strong 
iron and steel power. This message is justified by the fact that 
China's backward iron and steel production structure has caused 
a substantial gap between its iron and steel industry, and that 
of the world in terms of quality, variety, consumption, cost, 
and labor productivity. Statistics show that only 25 percent of 
technology and equipment used by China's iron and steel industry 
is relatively advanced, and 30 to 40 varieties of its steel 
products cannot satisfy demand. The energy consumption levels 
of key iron and steel enterprises are 40 percent more than 
advanced international levels. Only 83 percent of steel is 
turned into finished products, 10 percent less than in Japan. 
In terms of continuous casting ratios, China is the fourth 
lowest among the world's 17 countries which produce 10 million 
tonnes of steel each. And its real labor productivity is far 
below advanced international levels. 
  Over the past few years, the poor structure of the iron and 
steel industry was masked by quantitative shortages because of 
the substantial imbalance between supply and demand in our 
country's iron and steel products. Rapid growth in steel output 
has now effectively relieved the pressure of demand, thus 
facilitating efforts by the iron and steel industry to optimize 
its technological and economic structure. Some metallurgists in 
China pointed out: China's iron and steel industry has entered a 
transition period in which it is shifting from emphasizing 
"tonnage growth" to "optimizing its structure." If China wants 
to become a steel power capable of producing more than 100 
million tonnes of steel, it cannot merely increase tonnage on 
the basis of its current structure but should seek increases on 
the basis of an optimized structure. 
  Because the iron and steel industry is an important raw and 
semifinished materials sector, its structural optimization is by 
no means its own internal affair; this is a demand stemming from 
national economic restructuring regarding the development of the 
iron and steel industry. For a long time to come, our country 
will need large quantities of various high-quality steel 
products if it wants to greatly expand the railway, 
transportation, energy, communications, automobile, and 
electronic sectors. For this reason, Metallurgy Industry 
Minister Liu Qi urged the iron and steel industry to perform the 
following tasks to optimize its structure: Speeding up the 
development of continuous casting technology to promote the 
optimization of steel smelting and steel rolling technology; 
focusing on upgrading the technical levels of a number of old 
enterprises and special steel enterprises; devoting major 
efforts to applying various new techniques and technologies; and 
going all out to develop domestic mines. 
  Liu Qi also pointed out emphatically: In optimizing the iron 
and steel industrial structure, we must change our concepts 
instead of merely increasing output and expanding the production 
scale to improve efficiency. The key to improving efficiency 
lies in increasing the technological contents of all production 
stages, in optimizing technological lines, and in manufacturing 
competitive products. We should take structural optimization as 
a major task which determines the iron and steel industry's 
long-term success or failure. 
  Iron and steel industry people in foreign countries now 
recognize that quantity and scale are no longer the sole 
hallmark of a country's iron and steel industrial strength. To 
emerge as a strong iron and steel power in the world, China's 
iron and steel industry must devote great efforts to optimizing 
its structure, and change its status as an iron and steel power 
with high output in favor of a strong iron and steel power with 
high productive capacity and productivity.

  [Text] Beijing, February 17 (CNS) -- The rapid development 
of Mainland township enterprises has made them the main pillar 
of the rural economy and probably constitutes half of the total 
national economy, while playing an important role in leading 
farmers to become comparatively well-off since reform and 
opening to the outside world got underway. The township 
enterprises, however, are facing various crises after 
state-owned enterprises staged property rights reform, obtaining 
more self decision-making powers and enhancing their competitive 
strength. 
  The total output value of the country's township enterprises 
is reported to have been RMB 2,900 billion [renminbi] last year, 
of which the total industrial output value was RMB 180 billion, 
profits RMB 160 billion and tax paid RMB 95 billion. The 
industrial output value of township enterprises last year made 
up 40 percent of the country's total and the exports of such 
enterprises were worth RMB 190 billion, making up 45 percent of 
the country's total export value. 
  The earlier form of township enterprises were people's 
commune-owned enterprises. The "big rice bowl" practice 
resulted in slow development of such enterprises. Rural 
productivity did not increase until the introduction of the 
contractual household responsibility system linking remuneration 
to output in 1978. A large number of surplus labourers were 
absorbed by the township enterprises and their rapid development 
was seen from then on. What was important was that the township 
enterprises in Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang and Jiangsu had much 
capital introduced from Hong Kong and Macao for the development 
of the processing industry, forming an important force in the 
Chinese economy. 
  China now has 21 million township enterprises employing 112 
million workers with six million newly recruited last year. In 
recent years, 60 percent of the increase in the average income 
of farmers was earned from such enterprises. They also supplied 
more than RMB 40 billion to fund the development of irrigation 
works, scientific research, transportation, culture and 
education. More than 400 township enterprises had an output 
value of over RMB 100 million last year and 300 of them a sales 
value of RMB 100 million while another 100 of them had an export 
value of RMB 100 million. 
  One of the main reasons for the rapid development of 
township 
enterprises, however, was the lack of competition of state-owned 
enterprises due to their rigid economic system. But, after the 
reform of property rights and the expansion of 
self-decisionmaking powers of the state-owned enterprises, the 
township enterprises have faced five crises, including their 
weak operating mechanism, their reliance on the major 
enterprises, had management, backward technology and low quality 
of their products. How to settle these problems is a task 
facing the new situation.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Deepen Reform, Stabilize </F>
Agriculture"] 
  [Text] As the popular saying goes, "the whole year's work 
depends on a good start in spring." When the Year of the 
Rooster is replaced by the Year of the Dog, another green spring 
is coming. The first solar term of the Beginning of Spring has 
passed and the Spring Festival has also passed. Farm work all 
over the vast land of China is getting busy from the south to 
the north. 
  The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee 
made a decision on the establishment of the socialist market 
economic structure, and the 29th to 36th points of the decision 
especially discuss the rural work and the rural economy. The 
central rural work conference also made concrete arrangements 
for rural work and the rural economy. After that, the party 
Central Committee and the State Council adopted a number of 
policies and measures for rural work and the rural economy. All 
this came like the life-giving spring breeze and rain, and 
brought spring to the vast rural areas ahead of time. 
  What, then, are the main tasks in our current rural work? 
They may be summarized in five phrases. That is, stabilizing 
and improving basic policies; deepening reform; solving 
prominent contradictions; concentrating strength to develop the 
rural economy; and strengthening the position of agriculture as 
the foundation for the national economy. In particular, the 
link of deepening reform will play a leading and guiding role, 
because the settlement of many things in rural work and the 
rural economy have to rely on the deepening of reform. 
  As for deepening reform, for the time being, we should give 
consideration mainly to the following three issues: First, 
promoting the reasonable movement of production factors, giving 
play to peasant initiative and rural economic units, raising 
labor productivity and the utilization rate of all sorts of 
resources. The joint-stock cooperative system is a new thing in 
the course of reform, and it should be further advanced on the 
basis of summing up experience. The most important thing for 
township and town enterprises is to adopt flexible operational 
mechanisms, which must not be given up. Of course, they should 
continue to explore new organizational forms, rationalize 
property rights relationships, and give better play to 
competitive mechanisms. Second, establishing and perfecting the 
rural market system. The most important thing in this regard is 
to create good linkages between the rural and urban markets and 
between industry and agriculture. The hundreds of millions of 
peasant households should be properly linked with the big 
markets. At present, various localities have created various 
forms of agriculture-industry-trade integration and integrated 
production-supply-marketing systems. They should be further 
developed. Third, it is necessary to establish a state system 
for guiding, protecting, regulating, controlling, and serving 
agriculture, with stress laid on protection and service. 
  In the whole country, this year's reform intensity and depth 
will be unprecedented. We can say that this year will be a 
reform year in real terms. In this important year, we must 
properly handle the relationship between reform, development, 
and stability, and must maintain a stable political environment 
and a favorable economic environment. To achieve this purpose, 
we must first stabilize agriculture, ensure the sufficient 
supply of farm products, prevent prices from fluctuating too 
violently and keep price changes within the scope of social 
endurance. Therefore, it is never a stereotyped expression to 
call for strengthening the position of agriculture as the 
foundation for the national economy and strengthening the rural 
work. We must never neglect agriculture when the agricultural 
situation is good, and must always attach importance to 
agriculture when facing arduous tasks. An important link in the 
adjustment of the economic structure is the proportions allotted 
to agriculture and industry, in which the proportion of 
agriculture in the national economy as a whole should be 
increased. This is not only related to agriculture but also to 
industry. At present, industry is not only facing a shortage of 
funds, but more importantly, it is also facing a market problem. 
Industrial products do not sell well and seriously over 
stockpiled. Then, where is the biggest market for industrial 
goods? It is in the vast rural areas. Without setting the 
rural market in motion, we will not have a stable foundation for 
industrial development, and the market for industrial products 
will shrink. Therefore, adjusting the structure and 
strengthening agriculture must not be just empty talk. From the 
central to local authorities, all must adopt the guideline and 
concrete measures for strengthening agriculture.

"Where Can the Surplus Laborers From Rural Areas Go? -- Some 
Thoughts on the `Tides of Rural Workers'"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 8 Feb (XINHUA) -- I. 
  With the arrival of the Spring Festival, the flow of workers 
from rural areas has come to an upsurge. According to reports 
from various localities, after the Spring Festival, more than 1 
million rural workers will leave home for the first time to join 
the ranks of workers working away from their hometowns. 
  The flow of rural workers during this period has coincided 
with the busy "Spring Festival travel." As many as 10 million 
workers from rural areas are returning home for the Spring 
Festival, and then they will join the streams of people 
returning to cities after visiting their families, thus putting 
huge pressure on the transportation sector. 
  In the early 1980's, the saying that "to make a fortune, 
people from the east, west, south, north, and middle should go 
to Guangdong" began to spread. In mid-1980's, several million 
peasants in the hinterland came down to the Zhujiang Delta to 
work, thus creating a fairly big impact on local development. 
After this area was saturated with rural workers from other 
parts of China, job seekers from the hinterland went to Fujian, 
Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and other coastal provinces and 
cities. 
  While tens of thousands of peasants from Sichuan, Hunan, 
Anhui, Henan, Guangxi, and Hubei have moved to the south or east 
to work, several million skilled craftsmen from coastal rural 
areas have moved to the north and west. The scale and the scope 
of the tides of rural workers continued to broaden, causing 
positive effects for urban economic and social development in 
addition to having some impact on society. 
  What worries people most is those roving peasants who cannot 
find jobs after experiencing many frustrations. In recent 
years, there invariably have been many peasants who have had to 
linger at train stations, ports, or other public places after 
the Spring Festival, thus having a negative impact on normal 
social life. This reporter has interviewed some jobless 
peasants at the Guangzhou Train Station. They did not have any 
idea about who would need them or where to go after they left 
home. Their experiences are really sad. Last spring, over 
200,000 peasants in Sichuan alone became vagrants. 
<H5>  II. </H5>
  The "tides of rural workers" are not accidental. 
  China has a huge population, little farmland, and a poor 
foundation to start with. The goal of 900 million peasants is 
to develop the economy and have better lives. 
  The implementation of the household contract responsibility 
system with remuneration linked to output has greatly liberated 
the productive forces in rural society and has pushed 
agriculture to higher levels. At the same time, the problem of 
surplus laborers caused by insufficient farmland -- a problem 
that was formerly addressed by the system of "eating from the 
same big pot" -- was exposed right away. This problem became 
more acute because of higher labor efficiency. According to 
some people's estimates, more than 100 million surplus laborers 
emerged in China's rural areas in the early 1980's. 
  Reform and opening up broke the old, state-planned economic 
pattern and changed the situation in which urban and rural areas 
were separated. Many peasants changed their old thinking of 
"growing old and dying where they were born and brought up." 
The space for developing production was also expanded from 1.5 
mu acreage per capita to the entire village, thus creating a new 
situation in which "agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, 
sideline production, and fisheries are launched at the same time 
and all businesses -- industrial, construction, transportation, 
services, and commercial undertakings -- thrive together." 
  Peasants widened and extended farmland by developing barren 
mountains, unused bodies of water, deserted beaches, and 
wasteland. They developed "blue farmland" in the sea and 
promoted farming, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries in 
an all-around way. The comprehensive development of 
agricultural resources has created both wealth and new job 
opportunities for numerous workers in the agricultural sector. 
  The appearance of township and town enterprises has provided 
hundreds of millions of peasants with a new area of development 
besides agricultural production. At present, country folks are 
active in all sectors of the national economy. In 1993, total 
sales of the nation's township and town enterprises reached 
2,600 billion yuan, their net profits reached 160 billion yuan, 
the taxes they delivered to the state totaled 95 billion yuan, 
the total value of goods they delivered for export reached 190 
billion yuan, the value of new fixed assets reached 150 billion 
yuan, the amount of funds they contributed for supporting rural 
construction projects reached 29 billion yuan, the amounts of 
funds they contributed for subsidizing agricultural production 
and construction reached 13 million yuan, and at least 60 
percent of the increase in peasants' net per capita income came 
from township and town enterprises. What merits mention is that 
more than 3 million urban residents are applying their skills in 
enterprises in rural areas. 
  The development of industrial production and commodity 
circulation in rural areas has given rise to the appearance of 
some 10,000 small towns along with the vigorous development of 
tertiary industry in rural areas. In rural areas there are now 
more than 12 million tertiary industrial enterprises providing 
all forms of services relevant to people's needs in terms of 
clothing, food, housing, transportation, cultural activities, 
and recreation, as well as services needed before, during, and 
after production, and these enterprises employ more than 40 
million workers. The number of people in rural areas working 
part time in tertiary industrial enterprises is even higher. 
  While some 100 million rural laborers have changed jobs and 
work in factories without leaving their hometowns in rural 
China, over 10 million peasants in the country have moved into 
cities to live and work. Each year the number of peasants 
coming to cities to work and do business exceeds 20 million. In 
doing the kinds of jobs that city people are unwilling to do or 
for which the latter consider the pay to be unattractive, these 
laborers are providing urban residents with inexpensive and fast 
services. Today rural workers can be seen working hard in 
places where large developmental projects are being constructed. 
  During the course of reform and opening up, Chinese peasants 
are exploring new job opportunities for rural laborers. By the 
end of 1993, the total number of workers working for township 
and town enterprises in the country had reached 112 million. 
These workers, as well as the 40 million rural laborers who 
spent most of their time in the distribution sector and service 
trade even though they did not work for township and town 
enterprises, show that at least 110 million farmers have "washed 
their feet" and moved into nonagricultural sectors in the last 
decade, thus causing a massive transfer of the labor force from 
rural areas unprecedented in world history. 
  The development of township and town enterprises and the 
establishment of new towns are Chinese peasants' innovations, 
because of which China does not have to force large numbers of 
bankrupt persons to flow into the cities, which is not the case 
in some countries; and the state does not have finance all by 
itself the investment needed for industrial development and 
turning peasants into workers. According to estimates, 
approximately 80 million surplus laborers in rural areas have 
found jobs in township and town enterprises since 1980, and if 
the state had to build factories to place many of these people, 
1.6 trillion yuan would be needed. This is tantamount to 
several years of the nation's revenues, and if surplus laborers 
in rural China have to be placed in cities by the end of this 
century, the scale of newly built cities must be at least double 
that of the total number of cities today [as received]. This is 
simply impossible, no matter how we look at this issue. 
  China has a very large population, anyway, and regional 
development is uneven. For various reasons, the level of 
economic development in rural areas in central and western China 
and some underdeveloped areas along the coast is low, the 
increase in peasants' income has been slow, and problems of 
surplus laborers are conspicuous. This is why many peasants 
have left home to look for opportunities to become rich in 
coastal areas, cities, and economically developed areas. 
Nevertheless, job opportunities are not limitless in certain 
periods, even in coastal and economically developed urban areas. 
As a result, the rural workers who move from place to place to 
find jobs have caused this widespread "tide of rural workers." 
<H5>  III. </H5>
  Of the 1.1 billion people in China, 900 million are 
peasants. 
All the people of the nation cannot lead a fairly comfortable 
life unless peasants are able to live comfortably. Whether we 
can attain a relatively comfortable standard of living in rural 
areas depends on whether we can successfully transfer hundreds 
of millions of surplus rural workers to other fields by the end 
of the century. Therefore, to understand and solve the issue of 
"flows of rural workers," we should take developing productive 
forces, optimizing the allocation of resources, and maintaining 
social stability into full consideration. 
  Rural workers moving from place to place are faced with the 
need to improve their lives, and some regions and enterprises do 
need rural workers for their own development. Therefore, we 
need to provide correct guidance to flowing rural workers 
instead of simply imposing restrictions on them. On the other 
hand, current conditions such as transportation can hardly 
accommodate large-scale flows of rural workers. The need for 
rural workers is limited in coastal and economically developed 
urban areas. In addition, our big cities and super-big cities 
are already "too big." If we do nothing to persuade the rural 
workers pouring into big cities to do otherwise, the existing 
urban problems are bound to worsen and will shake our society. 
Therefore, only by transferring surplus rural workers through 
multiple levels and channels and guiding the flows of rural 
workers in an orderly way can we ease the "tide of rural 
workers" fundamentally. 
  By making an objective analysis of the characteristics and 
pattern of the flows of rural workers, we will find out that 
existing channels for transferring rural labor are very broad. 
  First, the flow of rural workers from central and western 
regions to the east is a general pattern at present because of 
the disparity existing between different regional economic 
levels. In 1992, the total output value of village and town 
enterprises nationwide reached 1,758.4 billion yuan, two-thirds 
of which were from 10 provinces in the east and only one-third 
from 20 provinces in the western and central regions. In that 
year, the proportion of output of village and town enterprises 
in the gross social product in rural areas accounted for 76.91 
percent in the eastern region, 63.48 percent in the central 
region, and 38.2 percent in the western region. The huge 
disparity between the central and western regions, and the 
eastern region is the motive force compelling peasants in the 
central and western regions to leave home and also where the 
huge potential for solving the issue of transferring surplus 
labor from rural areas lies. If the central and western regions 
and underdeveloped areas -- where the tides of rural workers 
originate -- are able to quicken the development of village and 
town enterprises in light of actual conditions by beginning with 
projects that require less input, yield greater economic 
results, and promise quick returns, they can improve local 
economies and create tens of millions of job opportunities. 
Bashan, which was a poor and backward mountain village in 
central Shandong only a dozen years ago, has struggled hard to 
develop secondary and tertiary industries and has become a very 
rich "star village." The collective assets owned by the entire 
village are as great as "1 million yuan" for each family. 
Zhangjin village, of Qianjiang city on the Jianghan Plain, 
started with the garment industry and established the "Xingfu 
Group," whose annual output value exceeds more than 100 million 
yuan. They changed the name of their rundown village to "Xingfu 
[Happy] village." Dongzhou village, of Sanyuan County on the 
dry land north of Weihe, became an "industrial village" on the 
loess plain after developing village and town enterprises..... 
Villages like these have emerged in batches across the country. 
The thing they have in common is that they not only solve the 
problem of the local surplus of labor but also absorb tens of 
thousands of laborers from surrounding areas and other provinces 
by developing their own economies. In those eastern coastal and 
economically developed regions to which the tides of rural 
worker flow, we can promote cooperation between the east and the 
west to transfer labor-intensive industries to underdeveloped 
regions, thus enabling surplus rural laborers in underdeveloped 
regions to find jobs without having to go far away from home. 
  Second, another special feature of the flows of rural 
workers at present is that they flow to nonagricultural areas 
from rural areas. One reason is that peasants in rural areas 
seem to feel that it is hard to lead a comfortable life by 
working in the fields. In fact, if we lead peasants to broaden 
their outlook, steer them toward the market, and comprehensively 
develop agricultural resources in breadth and in depth by 
relying on agrotechnology to promote farming, forestry, animal 
husbandry, and fisheries in an all-around way, while at the same 
time combining the planting, breeding, and processing of 
agricultural products into a coordinated process in production 
and operations, we can increase agricultural efficiency by a 
large margin and create several million job opportunities. In 
addition, rural areas also have conditions for developing 
village and town enterprises. Many examples of developing 
industry and agriculture side by side have come up in many 
traditional rural areas. 
  Third, one more pattern of the flows of rural workers is 
that 
they all want to swarm into cities and towns of economically 
developed areas. This shows that the industrialization and 
construction of small towns in the central and western regions 
lag behind those of the eastern region. If the central and 
western regions can connect the development of village and town 
enterprises with the development of farm and sideline products 
markets and the construction of small towns, as well as 
encourage and support local peasants and businessmen from other 
regions in investing, setting up factories, and opening shops in 
their regions, a great number of rural workers who leave home 
and look for jobs in other cities will be able to find jobs near 
their homes. In recent years, a group of towns and villages 
rejuvenated by developing secondary and tertiary industries have 
appeared in central, western, and underdeveloped areas, thus 
becoming the "sparks" for developing local economies. 
  Fourth, at present, the flows of rural workers are unchecked 
and are without order. An important reason for this is that 
they lack information about the supply of and demand for 
laborers. Moreover, because of the lack of intermediate service 
agencies in the labor market, some peasants just go out blindly 
and try their luck without possessing any information. 
Therefore, the key to making rural workers' flows orderly lies 
in accelerating the cultivation and perfection of the labor 
market system in urban and rural areas. In recent years, on the 
one hand, Guangdong Province established regular ties with the 
other provinces concerned and developed comparatively permanent 
labor import bases; on the other hand, Guangdong avoided 
importing labor during "Spring Festival travel" to gradually 
make the flows of rural workers into this province stable and 
orderly. This experience merits attention. 
  Fifth, it will take some time before the state of 
development of various trades and professions permits them to 
employ more surplus rural workers. A certain number of surplus 
rural workers will continue to exist in rural areas for quite a 
long time. Furthermore, the transfer of surplus rural workers 
and the flows of rural workers from place to place involve all 
sectors of society, including rural and urban areas, 
labor-export and labor-import areas, as well as employment 
departments, transportation departments, and other service 
organizations. Joint efforts by various departments and areas 
are objectively necessary. Therefore, governments in all 
localities at all levels must strengthen their overall planning, 
management, regulation, and control to do a good job of 
developing labor markets and relevant services, in giving advice 
to rural workers, and in promoting the development, utilization, 
and rational allocation of rural labor resources. Under the 
premise of ensuring agricultural development, localities should 
guide surplus rural workers to flow gradually and in an orderly 
manner to nonagricultural enterprises and areas to thus maintain 
a fine social and economic order. 
  To encourage and guide surplus rural workers to flow 
gradually and in an orderly manner to nonagricultural 
enterprises and areas are important events vital to the overall 
state of national economic development. We should adopt the 
appropriate policies and measures to promote the quality of 
agriculture, the development of village and town enterprises, 
and the construction of small towns in an effort to transfer 
more surplus rural workers to or near their homes. At the same 
time, we must keep abreast of the information about the supply 
of and demand for labor and the flows of rural workers, 
vigorously and smoothly develop cooperation in labor affairs 
according to the demands of areas, and promptly sum up and 
popularize successful experiences in this field. With the 
development of the economy, all trades need more workers and 
also require a higher quality of labor. After we analyzed the 
rural workers who have found that finding jobs is difficult, we 
learned that most of them are peasants who do not possess any 
skills and who have a low level of education. If we train 
surplus rural workers in various ways to improve their quality 
and certain of their skills, we will broaden their job 
flexibility, improve their money-earning skills, raise society's 
spiritual level, and promote social stability. 
  Hundreds of millions of surplus rural workers are an asset 
of 
our society. The development of the entire national economy 
will provide broader and wider job opportunities for surplus 
rural workers. As long as we continue to follow the existing 
road in transferring rural workers, promote the transfer of 
surplus rural workers through multiple levels and channels, and 
rationalize and optimize the allocation of rural labor resources 
by cultivating labor markets, we will be able to bring order to 
the transfer and flows of surplus rural workers.

  [Text] Nanjing, February 17 (XINHUA) -- The countryside 
across southern Jiangsu Province, well-known as "the birthplace 
of township enterprises", has entered the initial stage of rural 
industrialization, according to a recent survey conducted by the 
Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences. 
  The region embraces three cities of Suzhou, Wuxi and 
Changzhou. 
  Township enterprises, the mainstay of the local economy, 
brought in 280 billion yuan in output value last year, 
accounting for 70 percent of the province's total. 
  On the other hand, high efficiency has helped reduce farming 
population to 9 million, with each farmer bringing in about 100 
kg of grain per year from land averaging 0.05 ha per person. 
  So far, all 12 counties in the region have edged into the 
country's 100 economically powerful counties, with four among 
the top six. They are Wuxi, Jiangyin, Zhangjiagang and Changshu. 
  The introduction of the joint stock system in 1993 is viewed 
as a key to the region's success. 
  By the end of 1993, around 90 percent of partnership 
enterprises the provincial-level enterprises groups were born in 
the area, together with over 6,500 foreign-funded enterprises. 
  Suzhou City, whose township industry grossed 80 billion yuan 
in sales and 20 billion yuan in exports, has converted 4,025 of 
its 12,000 township firms into joint ventures. 
  At present, more than 90 percent of the existing 430 towns 
under these three cities have risen to become multi-million-yuan 
towns. 
  The township enterprises have subsidized farm production at 
an annual average of over 200 million yuan since 1990. Last 
year, the figure reached 360 million yuan. 
  The degree of farm mechanization in some of its cities and 
counties has reached the level of developed countries. 
  A comprehensive system of farming services has been 
coordinated throughout the region, ranging from plant protection 
and irrigation to seed and fertilizer supplication. 
  All-round services have reduced heavy field labor by 70 
percent and farmers have higher income than most workers of 
enterprises. 
  At present, farmers in the region have contracted for 
cultivated land of more than 33,350 ha from the collectives, 
accounting for 15 percent of land for planting cash crops.

<F P=106> [By unattributed WEN HUI BAO commentator: "Start a New </F>
Round of `Two-Greening Projects'"] 
  [Text] The annual municipal conference on rural work, 
which has become a system adopted by past Shanghai municipal 
party committees and municipal governments, was convened on 5 
February. The conference decided on four central tasks for this 
year, one of which is the primary task of effectively 
strengthening the development of agriculture and of focusing on 
the "two-greening projects." What is meant by "two-greening 
projects?" The first is the vegetable basket project of 
concentrating on growing green vegetables in vegetable gardens; 
the other is the greening project aimed at improving the 
ecological environment. As the two projects concern the daily 
life of Shanghai residents and the municipality's ecological 
construction, great efforts and strong resolve must be made to 
carry them out successfully. 
  General Secretary Jiang Zemin recently pointed out: Little 
vegetable baskets have a bearing on the people's daily life, 
social stability, reform, and development. Anything that 
concerns the people's basic daily life and vital interests is of 
utmost importance. From this angle we must understand the 
importance of stabilizing agriculture and undertaking the 
vegetable basket project; we must, in the spirit of reform, 
solve the contradictions and problems we encounter in developing 
agriculture and carrying out the vegetable basket project. We 
should apply entirely new ideas to carrying out a new round of 
high-standard vegetable basket projects for Shanghai in three 
years, establishing a perfect system of vegetable basket 
projects, and exploring a new path for undertaking vegetable 
basket projects for the nineties and for an internationalized 
metropolis in the next century. 
  In recent years, because of the needs of urban development, 
vegetable growing and nonstaple food producing bases in the 
suburban areas have gradually been shifted to outer areas of the 
suburban areas. Therefore, the vegetable basket project must be 
steadily advanced in a planned way. It must be stabilized and 
upgraded in the course of readjustment. The outstanding problem 
faced now is the short supply of green vegetables during the 
slack season. In essence, this is due to the lack of 
agricultural facilities and the low ability to combat natural 
disasters. From the circumstances of the past few years, we 
have learned that to develop green vegetable production we 
should focus on strengthening the construction of production 
bases and that in strengthening the construction of production 
bases we should concentrate on the building of large vegetable 
growing greenhouses. In Shanghai, the supply of green 
vegetables during the slack season will be guaranteed if 
vegetables are grown in greenhouses on 25,000 mu of land in its 
suburban areas. 
  We should be aware that the vegetable basket project 
involves 
many sectors, channels, and links in society. Therefore, it 
needs joint efforts and cooperation from various levels and 
sectors of society. We should adhere to the principle of 
invigorating agriculture through the application of science and 
technology. Departments in charge of science and technology 
should mobilize and organize technicians to work in the 
frontline of production. In particular, they should organize 
forces to concentrate on tackling such problems as developing 
vegetable and nonstaple food production through intensive, 
standardized, and modern methods. Education departments should 
assist the suburban areas in speeding up the training of 
administrative cadres, technical cadres, and specialized 
personnel for the "two-greening projects" and in improving the 
quality of rural workers. 
  An important task in building Shanghai into an 
internationalized metropolis is to create a good ecological 
environment. While concentrating on the vegetable basket 
project, which stresses vegetable production, the masses of 
cadres and people in the suburban areas should also pay 
attention to grasping the project of greening the environment. 
Whether Shanghai can fulfill its greening target for 1994 
depends on the efforts of its residents. In the rural areas, it 
is necessary to develop greening by planting trees around 
housing areas, villages, and alongside rivers and roads; 
strengthen the construction of coastal forest belts; and 
popularize the greening method of planting economic trees in 
housing gardens. Let us act now and strive to create a beautiful 
ecological environment in all the suburban areas where "there 
will be flowers in spring, shade in summer, fruits in autumn, 
and greenery in winter."

  [Text] Shanghai, February 18 (XINHUA) -- Construction on 
Shanghai's No. One subway is expected to be completed and the 
subway will go into trial operation by the end of this year. 
  "When it officially opens to service next year, Shanghai 
will 
become the third city in the country to have subway traffic," Xu 
Kerang, deputy general manager of the Shanghai Subway 
Corporation, said. 
  Shanghai is China's largest economic center. 
  Construction of the subway began in January 1990 with a 
total 
investment of four billion yuan. 
  Starting from the Jinjiang Leyuan (garden) in the southern 
suburbs of Shanghai, the 16.1-kilometer, 13-stop subway will 
pass through the downtown shopping center to reach the railway 
station in the northern part of the city. 
  In addition, Xu said, preparation is under way to build the 
No. Two subway running from the downtown shopping district at a 
transfer point with the No. One subway, to the Pudong New Area, 
a newly-established economic zone that is expected to lead the 
transformation of Shanghai's industrial and financial sectors.

Zhang Xuequan (1728 1331 0356)] 
  [Text] Hua Yuda, chairman of the Shanghai Municipal 
Science and Technology Commission, said recently: To steer 
science and technology onto the market as soon as possible, and 
to organize scientists and technicians to better serve economic 
construction are the main themes of Shanghai's scientific and

  We must make great progress in industries using new and high

industries. We will strive to establish 200 new enterprises 
using new and high technology, increasing the output value of 
industries using such technology to more than 20 billion yuan 
this year, approximately 6 billion yuan more than last year's 
planned target. 
  We must increase the number of private scientific and 
technological enterprises from more than 6,000 currently to more 
than 7,000. We must vigorously lead qualified enterprises to 
broaden their scale, raise their technological levels, 
industrialize new and high technology, form conglomerates, and 
internationalize new and high technology. 
  We must achieve significant breakthroughs in technological 
exchanges and establish markets for specialized technologies, 
such as computer science, bioengineering, and new 
pharmaceuticals. In 1994, we will strive to achieve more than 
2.2 billion yuan in trade volume in technological markets. 
  We must make rapid progress in raising key basic research 
projects to world levels. Last year, more than 40 basic 
research projects reached advanced international levels. This 
year we will strive to make new progress on the basis of last 
year's achievements. 
  We must bring about significant changes in reforming the 
scientific and technological structure and grant independent 
foreign trading rights to research institutions which have sound 
foundations and conditions. We should set up, on a trial basis, 
a group of research and development institutions jointly funded 
by Chinese and foreigners, and combine basic research with 
technological development. 
  This year, Shanghai will create even better conditions under 
which scientists and technicians, the middle-aged and young ones 
in particular, will conduct scientific research. It will 
provide assistants for some 200 leading figures in various 
scientific fields; abundant scientific research funds for 
approximately 3,000 researchers of the basic sciences; and 
special allowances for around 150 key members in scientific and 
technological fields, who will receive an average annual 
allowance of 4,000 to 5,000 yuan per person.

<F P=106> [By reporter Huang Wei (7806 1218) and trainee Wu Hongxiao </F>
(0702 4767 1420)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 11 Feb (XINHUA) -- The Beijing Municipal 
Government has found a new way to tackle difficult problems in 
its work, that is, by conducting in-depth investigations and 
study to promote work. It is understood that of the 468 
investigation and study projects launched by the municipality 
last year, 352, or 75.2 percent, had been completed by the end 
of the year. Of these, more than 90 percent have been used in 
actual work. 
  Leaders of Beijing Municipality took the lead in undertaking 
investigations and study. Last year, Chen Xitong, secretary of 
the Beijing municipal party committee, and Mayor Li Qiyan 
conducted investigations and study on more than 30 occasions in 
various districts, counties, universities, colleges, 
institutions, factories, mines, shops, and remote villages in 
rural areas. They familiarized themselves with local situations; 
handled official business on the spot; asked questions directly; 
and examined, amended, approved, and passed on investigation 
reports. Motivated by the leaders, all leading cadres in 
various departments, districts, and counties took the initiative 
to undertake projects and participated in investigations and 
study. Most departments used the investigation and study 
results as the criterion for evaluating cadres' performance of 
their duties. Some units even established a cadres' 
investigations and study responsibility system for inspecting 
and supervising cadres' work on a regular basis. 
  A key factor of Beijing's fruitful results in conducting 
investigation and study lies in the combination of leaders with 
the rank and file and professionals with the masses. Relevant 
departments under the municipal committee worked concertedly 
with counties and districts in carrying out key municipal 
investigations and study projects. While conducting 
investigations and study for their long-term development plans, 
Xicheng, Dongcheng, Congwen, and Haidian Districts invited 
experts and scholars from scientific research institutes and 
universities to tackle key problems together. In this way, they 
complemented each other with their knowledge and improved the 
quality of investigation and study results. 
  Beijing Municipality also persistently geared investigations 
and study to serve policymaking and trouble-shooting purposes. 
In choosing investigation and study topics, the municipality 
emphasized the pertinence and timeliness of projects. As a 
result, most projects were related to improving work to a higher 
level or solving difficult and hot issues. While applying 
investigation and study results, the emphasis was put on 
investigating and solving problems at the same time. The 
municipal foreign economic and trade department, in view of 
declining foreign trade and exports in the first quarter last 
year, promptly organized investigations and put forward and 
implemented immediately six countermeasures, thus stopping the 
decline in exports and increasing exports by 12.3 percent last 
year, the highest in history. The municipal urban construction 
department, based on citizens' reports on problems existing in 
transportation and the city appearance, conducted investigations 
and study and put forward 10 suggestions for comprehensive 
improvement. Implementation of these suggestions has brought 
about initial successes. Haidian District conducted 
investigations and study focused on ways to scale new heights in 
the new technology and industrial development and experiment 
zone, and summed up questions in the fields of capital, 
qualified personnel, and development space, thereby helping the 
municipal government formulate relevant policies.

  [Text] Shenyang, February 17 (XINHUA) -- Shenyang, 
northeast China's biggest industrial city and capital of 
Liaoning Province, is growing into the region's business and 
financial center, according to economists. 
  Latest statistics show that the city withdrew 3.35 billion 
yuan of currency from circulation last year, ranking second 
after Guangzhou, leaving behind the three centrally controlled 
municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin. 
  Tang Shuangning, vice president of the Shenyang branch of 
the 
People's Bank China, said that the city's currency withdrawal 
from circulation has maintained an annual rate of 40 percent 
since 1990. 
  The net currency withdrawal means that during a given period 
of time, the amount of money put into circulation is smaller 
than the amount of money withdrawn. The chief means to withdraw 
money from circulation include retail sales, bank savings and 
recovery of agricultural debts, offering of services, property 
taxation and trading taxation at markets. Under the current 
economic system, it is regarded as a key indicator of the 
development of commerce, finance, communications and information. 
  This shows that Shenyang city is well on its way from an 
industrial city into a city with a developed commerce, finance 
and services.

<F P=106> [Commentary: It Is Necessary To Strengthen Control Over the </F>
Cultural Market] 
  [Text] Over recent years, a flourishing scene has emerged 
in the province's cultural market. Thus far, the number of 
cultural markets has developed to 19,581 in the province. These 
markets have played a positive role in building the socialist 
spiritual civilization, in meeting the ever-growing demands of 
the masses on cultural life, in settling down the surplus work 
force in society, and in increasing financial revenues of 
localities. However, along with the constant development of 
cultural market, some problems have been revealed, and some 
unhealthy articles have been put on market for sale, thus 
polluting and corrupting social environment and social 
atmosphere and arousing the broad masses of the people to great 
indignation. 
  Major indicators are: First, the cultural market has been 
flooded with illegal publications. Over the past two years, the 
Shenyang city cultural market administration department alone 
has ferreted out 120,000 copies of illegal books and periodicals 
of more than 300 categories. Second, the situation of publicly 
showing obscene video tapes has gained ground. Of the 2,000-odd 
video tape projection units in the province, a considerably 
great number of them are very poorly equipped. To pander to low 
tastes of some persons in society, these units have publicly 
projected the low-class films of Hong Kong and Taiwan and even 
the obscene video tapes of foreign countries. Third, some 
ballrooms have become the medium for prostitution and visits to 
whores. A few ballrooms have even employed young women to 
specially entertain the guests. In addition, the illegal 
running of video game recreation places and the confusion in 
performing market have also greatly jeopardized the society. 
  For this reason, governments at all levels should attach 
importance to building up the cultural market, strengthen the 
control over the market, and persist in the principles of 
advocating the healthy ones, permitting the harmless ones, 
resisting the vulgar ones, banning the obscene ones, and dealing 
blows to the reactionary ones. In addition, governments at all 
levels should conduct an all-round inspection and rectification 
of the cultural market, ban all unhealthy cultural places, and 
develop and support healthy cultural places. At the same time, 
governments should accelerate the establishment of the rules and 
regulations on management of the cultural market, rapidly build 
the ranks of workers of cultural market management organs, and 
improve the level of management of cultural market.

foreign-invested enterprises in Gansu, with a total investment 
of $970 million and foreign capital of $431 million. From 
January to November in 1993 there were 475 foreign-invested 
enterprises in the province, more than the total number of 
foreign-invested enterprises in the previous 14 years. Now 
foreign-invested enterprises in the province are involved in the 
processing of agricultural and sideline products, electronic 
products, petrochemicals, energy, and transportation. Their 
technological level has also improved. Viewed from their 
disposition, these foreign-invested enterprises are gradually 
spreading from Lanzhou to all parts of the province. Now there 
are foreign-invested enterprises in 14 prefectures and cities 
throughout the province.

<F P=106> [By reporter Fan Yingli (2868 5391 0448)] </F>
  [Text] Urumqi, 8 Feb (XINHUA) -- In 1993, Xinjiang has 
made considerable progress in various economic sectors, 
including industrial and agricultural production, opening up to 
the outside world, infrastructural construction projects, and 
development of natural resources. Xinjiang's 1993 GNP is 
expected to increase about 10 percent over that of 1992, and 
revenue income from various localities will rise 33.1 percent 
over that of 1992. Relatively sizable increases have been 
registered in total industrial and agricultural output, total 
foreign trade value, influx of foreign funds, and total 
investment in fixed assets. 
  Rural reform has enormously raised the productivity in 
agricultural and pastoral areas. Xinjiang has registered 
another bumper harvest in agriculture and animal husbandry for 
the 16th consecutive year in 1993. Total grain and cotton 
output are expected to reach 7 million and 700,000 tonnes 
respectively. The agricultural sector has begun to rapidly gear 
toward the market economy. Farming endeavors and the industrial 
sector have undergone relatively extensive restructuring. 
Productive and efficient agricultural projects yielding 
high-quality products have begun to appear in Xinjiang. 
  The continued implementation of Xinjiang's policy on opening 
up its border areas has enabled Xinjiang to open wider to the 
outside world. In 1993, Xinjiang's total foreign trade value 
was $910 million, increase 30.6 percent over that of 1992. The 
value of foreign trade transacted by Xinjiang's border areas 
amounted to $580 million or 63.6 percent of Xinjiang's total 
foreign trade value, up 82 percent over that of 1992. 
  Xinjiang's most outstanding achievement has been the 
development of its natural resources. Surveying and exploration 
for oil and gas in Junggar, Tarim, and Turpan-Hami Basin have 
reported a series of major breakthroughs. Xinjiang's crude oil 
output has surpassed 10 million tonnes for the first time in 
1993, and its capacity to process crude oil has reached 7.65 
million tonnes. The results of exploring for nonferrous metals 
have been remarkable, and exploration for natural resources has 
also yielded a series of encouraging accomplishments. 
Exploration and development of underground resources have 
reached large-scale and advanced levels. 
  Xinjiang's comprehensive economic progress has brought more 
and more benefits to the people of various nationalities. In 
1993, Xinjiang's peasants and herdsmen per capita annual income 
was 780 yuan, increase 5.4 percent over that of 1992. Urban 
residents' income also rose relatively noticeably.

  [Text] Urumqi, February 17 (XINHUA) -- Northwest China's 
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region seized favorable opportunities 
and made remarkable progress in major economic construction 
fields last year. 
  Local officials told reporters that the gross domestic 
product of the autonomous region was expected to reach 37.7 
billion yuan in 1993, an increase of 10 percent compared with 
the corresponding figure of 1992, while local revenue grew by 
33.1 percent to 3.47 billion yuan. 
  Big increases were also seen in total agricultural and 
industrial output value, imports and exports, the amount of 
promised foreign investment, and investment in fixed assets, 
according to the report. 
  Further reform measures in rural areas have greatly 
emancipated the productive forces of the autonomous region's 
countryside and pastoral areas, the officials said. 
  By 1993 Xinjiang had been blessed with bumper harvests in 
agriculture and animal husbandry for 16 years running. Last 
year, the output of grain and cotton was expected to reach seven 
million tons and 700,000 tons, respectively, said the officials, 
adding that Xinjiang has become China's No. 1 producer of cotton. 
  At the same time, the continuation of the policies for 
opening border areas has promoted the opening-up drive of the 
whole autonomous region. 
  Last year, Xinjiang scored an increase of 30.6 percent in 
its 
imports and exports, and did 910 million U.S. dollars in foreign 
trade. 
  The region has approved the establishment of 363 
foreign-funded enterprises in the past year, involving an actual 
use of 55 million U.S. dollars in foreign funds, while working 
hard to promote economic and technological co-operation with 
inland areas, and setting up its own economic and technological 
development zones. 
  As an effort to improve conditions for economic construction 
and to create a better environment for opening, the region has 
speeded up its building of basic facilities over the past few 
years. 
  In 1993 alone, Xinjiang invested 22.6 billion yuan in fixed 
assets and launched 35 major construction projects, including 
the double-tracking of 475.5 km of the railway from Lanzhou to 
Urumqi, building or rebuilding nine major highways, and the 
construction of the plant with a designed capacity of 140,000 
tons of ethylene. 
  In the meantime, Xinjiang region scored a series of 
breakthroughs in prospecting for oil and natural gas, nonferrous 
metals and other natural resources last year. It produced 10.35 
million tons of crude oil in that year and gained a processing 
capacity of 7.65 million tons of crude oil a year. 
  Local residents benefited from the overall economic 
development of the region. For instance, the per capita income 
for farmers and herdsmen of the region amounted to 780 yuan, up 
5.4 percent compared with the level of the previous year. 
  This year the local government has decided to continue to 
concentrate on the development of farming, energy, 
transportation and telecommunications, as well as on the 
building of infrastructure, industries serving the development 
of oil and gas, light and processing industries with farm and 
sideline products as the raw materials, and the establishment of 
rural and township businesses in the fields of industry and the 
service trades, according to the officials.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Chun Ching-lin, Domestic </F>
Information Service Department director under the Government 
Information Office and a member of the government's task force 
for dealing with airplane hijackings, by unidentified reporter 
at Chiang Kai-shek Airport; from the "News" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Director Chung, how are you? 
  [Chung] How are you? 
  [Reporter] Would you please provide us the latest 
information on the hijacking? 
  [Chung] To my knowledge, the airplane took off from Changsha 
at 0928 [0128 GMT], was hijacked over Nanping in Fuchou at 1005, 
and landed at Chiang Kai-shek Airport in Taoyuan at 1043. It 
was towed to a standby parking apron. The hijacker (Lin 
Wen-chiang) deplaned at 1055. This is the general picture of 
the hijacking. 
  [Reporter] Director Chung, have the passengers left the 
airplane? 
  [Chung] The passengers have not deplaned, but the hijacker 
has. 
  [Reporter] Are there any differences between this hijacking 
and previous ones? 
  [Chung] There are no differences. 
  [Reporter] Has Communist China taken any measures after our 
aviation control units found out about the hijacking? 
  [Chung] Not yet. Its past practice was to send an official 
message inquring about the general situation. However, it has 
not done so this time. 
  [Reporter] Have we sent personnel on board to conduct a 
safety inspection and carry out other measures? 
  [Chung] Deputy Director (Pan) of the Airport Police Bureau's 
Criminal Police Squad boarded the plane at 1052 to conduct 
negotiations and later led the hijacker off the plane. 
  [Reporter] Director Chung, would you please give us more 
information on the hijacker's identity and motive? 
  [Chung] According to our investigation at the airport, the 
hijacker (Lin Wen-chiang) was born on 8 June 1958. He donned a 
military uniform to pose as an armed police officer to carry out 
the hijacking. His family has five members, including himself, 
his foster mother, wife, and two children aged 7 and 9, 
respectively. By his own account, he hijacked the airplane 
because he was given a hard time by the local government when he 
applied for permission to set up a company in Changsha where he 
had been doing business. He decided to leave Communist China 
because he found its authorities corrupt. 
  [Reporter] Did the hijacker incur resistance or was anybody 
injured during the hijacking? 
  [Chung] This is still under investigation. We are waiting 
for officials from the Taoyuan District Prosecutor's Office to 
conduct an interrogation.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 18 (CNA) -- A mainland soldier, 
identified as Lin Wenqiang, teamed up with his wife and three 
other family members to hijack a Southwest China Airlines Boeing 
737 to Taiwan Friday morning. 
  It was the first hijacking of a mainland passenger plane to 
Taiwan in 1994 and the 11th since last April. 
  Lin, 26, wearing the uniform of a People's Liberation Army 
soldier, forced the Boeing 737 to Taiwan with a knife and a 
glass filled with tissue paper which lin claimed was an 
explosive, airport police reported. 
  The hijacking was reported at around 10:30 a.m. [0130 GMT] 
after a Southwest China Airlines 737 flying from Chengdu in 
Sichuan Province veered off course over Fuzhou and approached 
Taiwan. 
  The flight, with 122 passengers and eight crew members on 
board, landed in Taiwan at 10:43 a.m. and was expected to fly 
back to the mainland via Hong Kong after refueling, the police 
said. 
  Lin, his wife, mother and two children were arrested for 
their involvement in the hijacking and were sent to the office 
of the Taoyuan prosecutor for questioning. 
  The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said Friday that 
Taiwan 
will continue to abide by the provisions of the Hague 
Convention, which requires separate treatment for hijacked 
aircraft and hijackers. 
  Despite several rounds of negotiations between SEF and its 
mainland counterpart Association for Relations Across the Taiwan 
Strait (ARATS), the two sides failed to reach any agreement on 
ways to avoid the repeated hijackings. 
  Friday's hijacking underlined air security problems on the 
Chinese Mainland. A Wednesday report by the International 
Airline Passengers Association called air travel in the 
mainland, "an ongoing disaster," and urged visitors to the 
mainland to avoid air travel. 
  Last year, ten mainland passenger airplanes were hijacked to 
Taiwan. The hijackings occurred on a number of different flight 
paths and took place in the months of April, June, August, 
September, October, November and December.

  [Text] Another Mainland airplane was hijacked to Taiwan 
again today after almost two quiet months. A Boeing-737 from 
Mainland China's Southwest Airlines was hijacked while en route 
from Chengtu [Chengdu], Szechuan [Sichuan] to Fuchow [Fuzhou] 
this morning, and landed at Chiang Kai-shek [CKS] Airport at 
1042 [0242 GMT]. 
  According to investigations, the man who hijacked the 
airplane was 25-year-old [age as heard] Lin Wenqiang. His wife, 
(Huang Chun-mien); his two children, (Li Hsin-yao) and (Li 
Hsin-kao); and his 68-year-old foster mother (Li Yu-ying) were 
also on board. The family of five were led by the aviation 
police off the plane for further investigations. 
  The airplane has departed CKS Airport at 1444 [0644 GMT]. 
Except for Lin Wenqiang, his family and other passengers on 
board were expatriated in the airplane. 
  It is understood that hijacker Lin Wenqiang, 25, is a Fukien 
[Fujian] native. Today, he donned a uniform to pose as a 
Communist Chinese armed police officer. To carry out the 
hijacking, he carried a fruit knife and placed tissue paper in a 
teacup to pass it off as an explosive device. According to the 
hijacker's confessions, he hijacked the airplane to Taiwan in a 
rage over the Communist Chinese local government's obstruction 
of his application to set up a company.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb 18 (AFP)--Armed with a fruit knife and 
a fake bomb and accompanied by his foster mother, wife and two 
children, a Chinese man hijacked a mainland airliner to Taiwan 
Friday -- the 11th such incident in 10 months. 
  Taiwan authorities sent Lin Wenqiang's family of four back 
to 
China aboard aboard the Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 later 
Friday. 
  The hijacking, the first this year, is expected to prompt 
China and Taiwan to reopen talks on the repatriation of 
hijackers, which collapsed over sovereignty and jurisdiction 
issues, officials here said. 
  Lin, 26 [age as received], a businessman from the southern 
Chinese province of Fujian, told Taiwan police he was persecuted 
by the communists in China and thus sought political asylum in 
Taiwan. 
  Dressed as a Chinese police officer, Lin surrendered to 
police immediately after the airplane touched down at Taiwan's 
international airport, police said. 
  The plane had been scheduled to fly from Chengdu in Sichuan 
province to the southern coastal city of Fuzhou. 
  The plane carrying 130 people, including the hijacker, his 
family and eight crew, began the journey from Changsha, Hunan 
province. 
  "They (the communists) persecuted me ... and repeatedly 
turned down my application to open a business," police quoted 
Lin as saying in the initial investigation. 
  Lin and his family -- his foster mother Li Yuying, 68, his 
wife Wang Chunlian, 23, his two sons Li Zhanghao, 9, and Li 
Zhangyao, 11,-- were taken to the airport police department for 
questioning, police said. 
  "Investigation showed that the family were previously not 
aware of what the suspect would do, and so they were sent back 
along with other passengers," Interior Minister Wu Poh-hsiung 
told reporters here. 
  But the wife resisted being put back on the plane and had to 
be forced, police said. 
  The jetliner and the 129 people, including family members 
and 
crew, returned to China four hours after the plane landed here 
at 10:43 a.m. (0243 GMT). 
  Lin was taken to the prosecutor's office for further 
questioning, police said. 
  "As the hijacking took place in Taiwan, we have the absolute 
right to handle the case here and try the suspect before 
deciding whether to send him back," Wu said. 
  Hijacking suspects' trials have been the major source of 
disagreement in the repatriation talks by the two sides of the 
Taiwan Strait. 
  The spate of hijackings, involving 15 mainlanders, including 
Lin, has become a new source of frictions between Taiwan and 
China. 
  The two have remained rivals since the 1949 Chinese civil 
war 
after which the defeated Nationalists fled to Taiwan. Both 
governments claim sovereignty over all of China. 
  China and Taiwan, represented by their semi-official 
agencies, began negotiations in Beijing in August 1993. 
  The second round of talks was held in China's coastal city 
of 
Xiamen last November, and the third round was in Taipei in 
December. 
  "They are reluctant to recognize our legal jurisdiction over 
the handling of the hijackers here, including trying them in 
Taiwan," Chiao Jen-ho, vice chairman of the semi-official 
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), charged. 
  SEF handles the negotiations on Taiwan's behalf. 
  "I believe the latest incident would prompt the mainland to 
realize the importance of the issue and to hold further talks 
with us," Chiao said. 
  Taiwan's cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Friday 
expressed regret over the incident and called on China to 
quickly reopen talks with Taipei to resolve the issue. 
  Taiwan has so far sentenced six of the 15 hijackers to jail 
terms ranging from six years to ten years.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 18 (CNA) -- Legislators from both the 
ruling party and opposition on Friday demanded that the 
government review its policy regarding Mainland Chinese 
hijackers who commandeer passengers planes to Taiwan, saying it 
is not harsh enough to curb the cross-strait air piracy. 
  Both Kuomintang Legislator Hung Chao-nan and Democratic 
Progressive Party Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung insisted that the 
existing measures be thoroughly reviewed. 
  Mainland hijackers have been sentenced to up to 15 years in 
prison here, but under current policy, will not be repatriated 
to the mainland after they serve their terms. 
  The two lawmakers made the remarks following reports that a 
Boeing 737 aircraft with 122 passengers and eight crew members 
on board was diverted to Taiwan Friday morning as it was en 
route from Chengdu to Fuzhou, a city in the southern coastal 
province of China. 
  It was the 11th mainland passenger aircraft commandeered to 
Taiwan since last April. 
  Hung also called on the military to step up air security. 
Some government officials here believe that Beijing may be 
using the hijackings to test Taiwan's air defense capability, 
though no sophisticated electronic devices designed to collect 
military information have been found on any hijacked aircraft. 
  Shen, however, remained concerned about the possibility of 
such a scheme. He said he could not figure out why Mainland 
China's air security personnel had yielded to hijackers equipped 
with "the most ludicrous hijacking weapons in the world." 
  In Friday's case, Lin Wenqiang, 36, hijacked a Southwest 
China Airlines Boeing 737 to the island with a knife and a glass 
filled with tissue paper, which Lin claimed was an explosive. 
  Shen and Hung also asked the government to press mainland 
authorities to strengthen flight security checks and step up 
their anti-air piracy publicity campaign.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb 18 (AFP)--Taiwan prosecutors said 
Friday they would recommend heavy punishment for a Chinese man 
who allegedly diverted a China Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 
here. 
  "Hijacking is a serious crime under international law, and 
we 
will ask that the court hand down severe punishment against the 
alleged hijacker," Lin Chieh-teh, chief of Taoyuan Prosecutor's 
Office, told reporters here. He said Lin Wenqiang had been 
arrested and detained by the office pending legal action here. 
Under local law, the maximum penalty for hijacking is life 
imprisonment. 
  Huang Hui-ho, deputy director of the Civil Aeronautics 
Administration, asked China to further tighten its airport 
security to prevent future cases from ocurring. "They must 
search the suspicious passengers, regardless whether they are 
police or not, before allowing them to board the plane," he 
said, referring to Lin's disguising himself as a police officer. 
  Lin, 36 (eds: correct), impersonated a military police 
officer, and ordered the crew of the Chinese airliner with 130 
people on board, including eight crew, to change course when the 
plane was on a domestic flight from Changsha to the coastal city 
of Fuzhou. 
  Lin, a business manager at a state-run company in Changsha, 
Hunan province, brought his foster mother, wife, and two sons 
aged 9 and 11 with him. 
  Lin was arrested after he surrendered to police when the 
plane touched down at Taiwan's international airport at 10:43 
a.m. (0243 GMT). All passengers, including Lin's family and the 
crew, were returned to Fuzhou via Hong Kong four hours later. 
  "I used a fake military police ID which I obtained through a 
friend to board the plane," Lin told reporters before being 
taken to the prosecutor's office, explaining why the airport 
personnel did not search him. 
  Lin used a knife and a fake bomb to make the pilot fly to 
Taiwan, Huang said. The bomb turned out to be a lid cup stuffed 
with toilet paper. The hijacker showed a crew member a piece of 
paper that said: "I want to hijack the plane to Taiwan. If you 
come close to me, I will blast off the plane," Huang said. 
  Lin said he had planned the hijacking since October last 
year. "I had been prosecuted [as received] by the communists ... 
and wanted to come here," he said, adding he was aware that 
hijacking was a crime in Taiwan. 
  The incident was the 11th in ten months, and the first this 
year. A total of 15 suspects were involved in the hijacking of 
Chinese airliners to Taiwan last year. 
  The issue has become a new source of friction between Taiwan 
and China. 
  The two sides have remained rivals since the 1949 Chinese 
civil war after which the defeated Nationalists fled to Taiwan. 
Both governments claim sovereignty over all of China. 
  Represented by their semi-official agencies, the two sides 
began negotiations in Beijing in August 1993. Although the two 
sides held three rounds of talks, no conclusion on the 
repatriation of the hijackers was reached. 
  China has strongly demanded the return of hijackers, but 
Taiwan insists it has the jurisdiction to handle the cases and 
try the hijackers here. 
  Taiwan has so far sentenced six of the 15 hijackers to jail 
terms ranging from six to ten years.

<F P=106> [News conference by Premier Lien Chan with foreign and </F>
domestic correspondents at the Government Information Office in 
Taipei on 4 February] 
  [Text] Yesterday, Executive Yuan President Lien Chan held 
a year-end news conference at which he answered 17 questions 
raised by domestic and foreign correspondents; the news 
conference lasted 65 minutes. 
  In response to relevant questions, Premier Lien noted: To 
develop cross-strait relations, the two sides should assume a 
pragmatic and rational attitude and seek common ground despite 
the fact that the country is divided and administered 
separately; otherwise, it will be hard for the hope for 
favorable interaction to materialize. On the Chiao-Tang talks 
currently underway on the mainland, Premier Lien emphasized: 
Instead of merely stating their positions, the two sides should 
adopt a problem-solving approach during the talks. At present, 
we must patiently confront differences that may arise, maintain 
our basic positions, and continue our efforts. 
  Lien Chan, who has been in office for nearly a year, also 
fielded questions raised by correspondents on the mainland, 
internal affairs, foreign affairs, financial affairs, and 
constitutional reforms. The following is what happened at the 
news conference: 
  Accompanied by Li Hou-kao, secretary general of the 
Executive 
Yuan, and Hu Chih-chiang, director general of the Government 
Information Office, Lien Chan entered the site of the news 
conference at 0830 GMT. He first extended New Year's greetings 
to the correspondents present and thanked the people in all 
circles for their efforts to encourage and supervise his cabinet 
over the past year. Thereafter, he began the hour-long news 
conference. 
  [Correspondent] Building Taiwan into an Asia-Pacific 
business hub is currently the government's major plan. Planning 
is quite complete in this regard. Mr. Premier, would you please 
explain all the specifics? Moreover, Taiwan cannot possibly 
exclude Communist China if it becomes a free trade area as a 
result of this plan. The question of direct shipping and air 
services between designated areas on the two sides of the Taiwan 
Strait will also be raised. Mr. Premier, what are your views on 
this matter? 
  [Lien Chan] The Asia-Pacific region achieved an average 
economic growth rate of 4.5 percent in recent years, which was 
the fastest economic growth in the world over the past few 
years. Its total output of goods and services represented about 
half the world's total output. The region is bound to become 
the focus of the world economy in the future. 
  The Republic of China [ROC] on Taiwan has the following 
advantages to become an Asia-Pacific business hub: 1) an 
excellent geographical environment; 2) excellent economic 
conditions; 3) ample and high-quality manpower; and 4) 
abundant capital markets. The government hopes to complete 
planning as soon as possible. It is expected that planning will 
be completed by the middle of this year. 
  Why should we so actively promote the ROC as a business hub? 
This is because, aside from the two traditional Asian business 
hubs of Hong Kong and Singapore, Japan's Osaka, Shanghai's 
Putung [Pudong] in Mainland China, Australia's Sydney, and New 
Zealand all are making similar preparations and attempts. Even 
Subic in the Philippines hopes for a piece of the action. We 
must work against time; otherwise, we will lose our development 
opportunities in three to five years. To be sure, we must also 
strengthen local construction. For example, our public 
facilities are still inadequate. That is why we proposed the 12 
construction projects to beef up our public facilities. Also, 
we should make great efforts to supplement our financial and 
legal systems with legislative work. 
<H3>  We Cannot Consider Things on Purely Economic Grounds; the 
Time Is Not Ripe for Direct Cross-Strait Shipping and Air 
Services </H3>
  With regard to direct air and shipping services between 
designated areas on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, the 
government has always placed importance on the question of the 
three cross-strait exchanges [mail, shipping and air services, 
and trade], listing them as long- and medium-range goals in the 
National Unification Program. We hope to attain these goals to 
facilitate economic and social development on both sides of the 
Taiwan Strait. Politically speaking, however, we must reach a 
common understanding with Communist China on treating us as an 
equal political entity, renouncing the use of armed force 
against us, and allowing us room for developing international 
relations before we can further discuss the question of three 
exchanges. Otherwise, the time is not ripe for solving complex 
problems within a purely economic context by initiating direct 
air and shipping services between designated areas on the two 
sides of the Taiwan Strait. 
  In reality, Communist China, in its white paper on Taiwan 
released last year, maintained that we should obtain their 
consent prior to signing any agreements on shipping and air 
rights with other countries. If cross-strait shipping and air 
services can be considered on purely economic grounds, why did 
Communist China's white paper contain such a statement? 
Personally, I do not think the time is ripe for direct shipping 
and air services between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. 
  [Correspondent] A final decision on the plan for 
readjusting the pay of military, government, and educational 
personnel in 1995 is imminent. People are very concerned. 
Premier, would you please give us a clear explanation in this 
regard? 
  [Lien] This matter is to be settled at a final meeting 
scheduled for Saturday [5 February]. However, I would like to 
take advantage of this rare opportunity to offer some specific 
explanations. 
  Pay readjustment for military, government, and educational 
personnel is a policy matter about which the government is very 
concerned. We have to take into consideration the government's 
financial capacity, inflation indexes, the competitiveness of 
the private-sector, and the material well-being and morale of 
government employees. The consumer price index, which rose 2.9 
percent last year, is expected to rise 3.4 percent this year. 
Therefore, a raise of about 3 percent should be appropriate. 
The Personnel Administrative Bureau has submitted two plans. 
Personally, I am inclined to adopt the 3-percent raise in 
drafting the budget. 
  [Correspondent] What are your expectations of the ongoing 
talks in Peiking [Beijing] on routine affairs between the 
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits [ARATS] and 
the Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF]? If the two sides are 
unable to reach agreement on some routine issues after extended 
discussions, will the government consider modifying its mainland 
policy? Will this lead even to a reduction in cross-strait 
exchanges? 
  [Lien] SEF-ARATS discussions on routine affairs constitute a 
link of our overall policy toward the mainland. Today, 
development of cross-strait relations depends on the two sides 
taking a pragmatic and reasonable approach toward the reality of 
a divided nation and divided rules and seeking a common ground 
from this reality. Without such an understanding, a relation of 
constructive mutual engagement [liang xing hu dong 5328 1840 
0062 0520] between the two sides will remain unattainable. 
  The current SEF mission left for the mainland in the hope of 
following up on the five understandings reached at the Ku-Wang 
talks and reaching an agreement. We will certainly welcome any 
agreement on fishing disputes or repatriation of hijackers and 
people who illegally enter Taiwan that is reached at the ongoing 
talks in Peiping. Certainly, some of these issues require us to 
tackle them with patience. 
  [Correspondent] Presidential adviser Li Kuo-ting 
recently questioned the feasibility of the plan for building an 
east-west superhighway. What do you think of such 
criticism? 
  [Lien] We should indeed care about government finances. Not 
only those in the government but people at large should show 
concern. When I assumed office last year, the government debt 
stood at NT$1,060 billion [new Taiwan dollars] and the balance 
in the annual budget was a mere NT$100 million; the situation 
was extremely difficult. We took a variety of emergency 
measures, and, as a result, the budget deficit has dropped to 
NT$84.9 billion and the balance in the annual budget has risen 
to NT$23.3 billion. However, because the universal health 
insurance services that will come into effect this year, the 
budget for public welfare spending for 1994 will double that of 
last year. This, plus a pay raise of military, government, and 
educational personnel, increased budgetary spending on education 
and science and weaponry purchases; there probably will be a 
NT$400 billion shortfall in this year's budget. 
  The government must also take the whole situation in 
consideration. On one hand, it must reduce spending, halt 
inappropriate public investment, and reduce waste; on the other 
hand, it must seriously consider all projects -- such as those 
for developing towns and cities and for regional balance -- that 
have a direct bearing on the people. Therefore, the east-west 
superhighway was given emphasis in the Six-Year National 
Development Plan. Often, only 60 percent of six-year plans are 
completed. Therefore, proper emphasis on priority projects will 
have a positive impact on national development and economic 
growth. 
  In response to calls from various quarters, the provincial 
government undertook, seven or eight years ago, a study and 
adopted the highway project. A feasibility study of the 
east-west superhighway project was conducted in 1990 and a 
project assessment was made in 1993. There is a thick file of 
materials about the two studies. Everyone is welcome to look 
through it. 
  More assessment will be needed in regard to the project's 
environmental impact and financing. When all the conditions -- 
environment, financing, technical capability, and private-sector 
participation -- are in place, we should push forward with this 
project. 
  [Correspondent] The idea of "two China's as a phase" 
forwarded by Economics Minister Chiang Ping-kun at the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] meeting has won 
widespread approval. I would like to know how would you, the 
premier, advance this policy in the future? 
  [Lien] The one-China policy is the nation's fundamental 
policy, but China is currently divided. The ROC is a sovereign 
nation founded in 1912, but currently the ROC holds the power of 
rule only over Taiwan, Penghu, Matsu, and Chinmen. This is the 
general environment, the fundamental reality. We believe that, 
realistically speaking, discussion of the sovereignty issue 
should be put aside at the present stage when considering the 
issues relating to foreign affairs and mainland policy. What 
should be done is to move forward step by step in the light of 
reality. 
  The APEC meeting was an economic occasion, not a government 
occasion. Therefore, no politically sensitive question should 
be broached there. Unfortunately, the Chinese Communists had 
the impudence to call our Taiwan a PRC province. Minister 
Chiang's statement was a tactical explanation to tell people 
that the reality is not what Chinese Communists claim. That was 
a tactical explanation made at a given circumstances and 
occasion. 
  [Correspondent] In the past, we said that politics 
should be separated from economics in our policy toward the 
mainland. Will this policy be continued? If a policy of not 
separating politics and economics is adopted, what chips does 
the government have to make the businessmen abide by such a 
policy? Thank you. 
  [Lien] Separating economics from politics -- I do not know 
whose idea this is. In regard to the overall situation 
vis-a-vis the mainland, I believe we should continue to take the 
National Reunification Guidelines as the supreme guidance and 
policy. It is a fact that our businessmen are investing in all 
sectors of the mainland's economy and we are trading indirectly. 
The mainland has seen rapid growth in the past few years, 
registering economic growth rates from 9 to as high as 14 
percent. However, can such high rates be sustained for long? 
This is a question that merits consideration. Shortages of 
public facilities and strong inflationary pressures are, in 
particular, factors that we should consider from an economic 
angle. In addition to economic risks, there is no denying the 
fact that all economic activities in the mainland carry some 
political risks, even high political risks. Nowadays, with 
regard to economic activities in the mainland, the government is 
more inclined to give guidance than issue prohibitions. 
However, we do not encourage such activities. Our approach is 
an incremental and indirect one. We do not want to place all 
our economic strength in one basket; the preservation and 
development of Taiwan's economic strength should be the guiding 
principle governing all our economic activities. I made a trip 
to Southeast Asia recently. Economics departments have also 
come up with the so-called southern policy. Our investment in 
Southeast Asia stands at about $15 billion today; imports from 
that region accounts for about 11 percent while exports account 
for 32 percent of the ROC's total exports. It is a very 
important region. 
<H3>  The Southern Policy Is Based on Pragmatism; More Efforts 
Will Be Needed To Break Out of Our Diplomatic Predicament </H3>
  [Correspondent] What is your view of the practice of 
"vacation diplomacy"? Are there plans for overseas trips for 
other cabinet members? 
  [Lien] The primary consideration behind my visit to 
Southeast Asia and the subsequent announcement of the "southern 
policy" is the fact that the ROC has an investment of $15 
billion in that region, which also accounts for 32 percent of 
the ROC's exports. With the exception of Thailand, we have 
signed agreements with all countries in that region on 
investment protection and protection against double taxation. 
We have close ties with them. We hope to participate more in 
Southeast Asian organizations meetings and activities. All in 
all, we must not look at only the regional and functional 
aspects in considering issues related to the "southern policy." 
  I made a trip to Southeast Asia not long ago primarily 
because it was New Year's and I had some days off. I went to 
Malaysia and Singapore and met their government leaders. The 
trip to Honduras was an official diplomatic mission ordered by 
the president. The government is facing great difficulties in 
diplomacy. I always feel that we should make our voice heard by 
our friends and the world at large. We also hope to make our 
strength, good will, contributions, and ideas heard and seen by 
all the people. 
  As long as resources permit, I am all for the idea that 
relevant government personnel should turn up more frequently in 
different locations and at different international occasions to 
publicize our nation. That is what you reporters call "show up 
faces." As a matter of fact, we have to show up to let 
everybody know that we did not vanish; rather we are growing in 
strength with each passing day. I think it is very important. 
  [Correspondent] Where do you think our mainland 
policy will go in a post-Teng Hsiao-ping [Deng Xiaoping] era? 
Hsu Chia-tun [Xu Jiatun], former director of the Hong Kong 
branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, said that under Li Teng-hui's 
strong leadership, the chance of peaceful reunification of China 
seems to be dwindling. What is your view? 
  [Lien] I have said many times that people across the strait 
are, fundamentally speaking, compatriots and siblings related by 
blood and flesh. There are no deep seated hatred or absolute 
irreconcilability between people of the two sides. What we are 
trying to do today is to create for the entire Chinese nation a 
free, stable, and prosperous future. Such a basic standpoint is 
accepted by all. 
  We can look forward to the nation's future, including 
unification. As a matter of fact, a politician's life is short, 
but a nation's life is forever. 
  I believe cross-strait relations should not be based on the 
ideas of a life-or-death struggle, or on the big consuming the 
small, or suffocating the other side at every turn. This would 
not be unification but annexation. A unification should be the 
merging of two to work together for the development of the 
nation. 
  The present Chinese Communist leader should, while he still 
commands tremendous authority, make a historic decision with a 
historical vision and lofty sentiments. That would be positive 
to the development of the nation. 
  [Correspondent] You have been premier for almost a 
year. Can you tell us the policies you are most and least 
satisfied with? 
  [Lien] In the past year, myself and the heads of the various 
ministries have worked in unity and devoted ourselves to public 
service. We have worked very hard to implement administrative 
renovation and economic rejuvenation. All these policies 
involve fundamental and structural issues. We do our best to 
reach a consensus. I have had the office for just 11 months. 
These policies were announced only last June or July. They 
have been implemented for a short time. However, all the signs 
indicate that all these policies are moving efficiently toward 
their goals and targets. 
  We have also done a great deal of work with regard to public 
security, environmental protection, agriculture, communications, 
and so forth. Administrative departments always want to 
accelerate the pace of implementation. We hope that legislative 
organs will support us by enacting relevant laws. When the laws 
are in place, administrative departments will be able to take 
bold and resolute actions to implement them. 
<H3>  The Cabinet Will Be Partly Reshuffled After the Lunar New 
Year; the Question of Candidates Cannot Be Determined Now </H3>
  [Correspondent] The "Chiao-Tang talks" somehow show 
that the higher the level of talks, the greater the efficiency. 
Communist China apparently wants to upgrade the talks. What 
are your views on this development and what are our future 
policy directions? 
  [Lien] In my opinion, the five joint agreements reached 
during last year's "Ku-Wang talks" should be implemented 
quickly. Regrettably, no progress was made on implementation 
after that, whether during the talks in Amoy, Peiking, or Taipei. 
  I am very doubtful that this problem can be solved by 
upgrading the talks. Basically, I think crucial problems remain 
between the two sides. We must patiently solve fishing disputes 
and the problem of repatriating airplane hijackers and illegal 
immigrants across the Taiwan Strait. 
  I have a demand, though: We should proceed while maintaining 
the nation's basic positions. As for matters other than those 
affecting our basic positions, we can make readjustments or 
adopt a flexible approach. 
  [Correspondent] Recently, there have been many reports 
that the cabinet may be partially reshuffled. Can you explain 
or clarify the matter? 
  [Lien] As I said before, everybody has been serving the 
country faithfully, contributing wholeheartedly, and remaining 
on good terms in the 11 months since I began serving in the 
cabinet. However, a few colleagues will not be able to continue 
their service for personal reasons or for reasons of family. I 
think we will make proper readjustments after the Lunar New Year. 
  As for candidates, since the Law on Provincial and County 
Autonomy, the Law on Autonomy for Cities Directly Under the 
Central Government, and the Law on Election and Recall have been 
submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation after 
Executive Yuan approval, we will hold gubernatorial and mayoral 
elections toward year's end if the legislative process is 
completed by the end of June. Perhaps there is a lot of 
guesswork out there. I do not think we can make specific 
decisions before the legislative process is completed. 
  [Correspondent] Judging by the property declarations 
filed by public servants, we understand that you have 17 types 
of stocks. The Executive Yuan has decided to collect a capital 
gains tax. Since some other government leaders also possess 
stocks, will this policy of collecting a capital gain tax affect 
the stock market or even smack of serving one's own interests? 
Will this lead to a situation where the "referee is also the 
ball player"? 
  [Lien] With regard to the stock transaction and capital 
gains taxes, the Legislative Yuan passed a resolution in 1992 in 
which it urged the government to make a decision at the earliest 
possible date. After hearing a briefing on the Finance 
Ministry's bill of amendments and the opinions of other 
ministries and commissions, the Executive Yuan concluded that 
the collection of such taxes would mark progress in terms of tax 
revenue, fairness in taxation, and simplified auditing and 
taxation procedures. It held discussions and adopted the bill 
accordingly. 
  A rapidly developing country will inevitably incur several 
problems in implementing financial, taxation, banking, land, and 
housing policies; and timely reviews of those policies are in 
order. Nevertheless, the government's policies are primarily 
based on national development and the interests of all people. 
  [Correspondent] The Presidential Office and the 
Executive Yuan appeared to be on very harmonious terms during 
the past year. What do you think were the reasons? Was it 
because of institutional or individual factors? Since direct 
presidential elections are the main purpose of the third round 
of constitutional reforms, how do you think the duties of the 
president and the premier should be divided after the 
introduction of popular elections of the president? 
  [Lien] The duties of the president and the premier are 
specified in very explicit terms in our Constitution. Because 
the president is the head of state, his guidance and leadership 
should be respected, especially on major national security 
policies such as foreign affairs, national defense, and mainland 
policies. During the past year, the Executive Yuan implemented 
many policies after they were discussed and assembled at high 
levels of the government. 
  Constitutional reforms will temporarily come to an end. The 
National Assembly will meet in April to decide on outstanding 
constitutional matters. In my opinion, what happens to the 
presidential duties will depend on how such duties are designed. 
Direct presidential elections will lead to presidential systems 
in some countries, but the presidents of some countries are 
still not responsible for actual administrative duties despite 
the introduction of direct presidential elections. Our 
constitutional system is based on the division of power among 
five branches. The best way is to introduce necessary 
amendments to this system. I believe that experiences and 
precedents in constitutional rule over the past 40 years will 
serve as a guide in the future. 
  [Correspondent] Lawmakers from the Kuomintang recently 
urged the government to allocate lawmakers' shares of budget 
funds for infrastructure construction. What are your views on 
this proposal? 
  [Lien] I used to serve in local government. My basic 
position is that the government does allocate some part of its 
annual budget for local construction projects. For example, the 
provincial government has different budget plans, such as those 
for local construction projects and for coordinating local 
needs. These are all for the benefit of local construction. 
People's representatives may make suggestions. Relevant 
ministries and commissions will give full consideration to these 
suggestions and decide whether they fit into the overall plan. 
This is our basic approach. It was how things stood during the 
three years I was with the provincial government. Suggestions 
made by people's representatives should be considered in order 
of importance and urgency. The right to decide whether or not 
to adopt those suggestions rests with the executive branch 
because it will be responsible for implementing budget plans and 
spending in the future. 
<H3>  We Have Conducted an Overview of Malpractices in Arms 
Purchases; We Will Focus on Tightening Budgetary Control </H3>
  [Correspondent] Yin Ching-feng's murder has revealed 
many problems regarding arms purchases. Do government 
departments have overall plans for reforming the practice of 
buying weapons? 
  [Lien] The problems with our arms purchases have caused 
widespread concern. Relevant departments have made timely 
reports in this regard. The Defense Ministry and other relevant 
units have begun to conduct an overview of problems stemming 
from purchasing malpractices. An arms purchase improvement 
package will be unveiled in the near future. We will focus on 
tightening control over budget utilization and on eliminating 
thorny problems in the process. However, we can only say this 
much because the Yin case has entered the judicial and 
investigative stage. The government will draw lessons and gain 
experience from this incident, and it will study the best 
methods for bringing about improvements. 
  [Correspondent] Along with presidential election 
methods, the premier's countersigning right is also one of the 
main subjects of the third round of constitutional reforms. You 
once said that the National Assembly's decisions on 
constitutional reforms should be respected. Aside from 
deferring to the National Assembly's opinions, do you think the 
premier's countersigning right should be readjusted? And how 
should we readjust it? 
  [Lien] I think the premier's countersigning right could and 
should be readjusted because it is indeed unreasonable in some 
respects. For example, the premier still has to countersign 
decrees that affect him personally, as well as personnel matters 
involving administrative officers over which the National 
Assembly has already exercised its right of consent. It is all 
the more unreasonable when formality requires the premier to 
countersign the appointments of civil servants at the 
grass-roots level, although he does not know whose appointment 
he is countersigning because there are thousands of them. While 
the premier should have the right of countersigning things, this 
right should be clearly defined, either by outlining matters 
requiring his countersignature or by eliminating those that do 
not require his countersignature. The right of countersigning 
things should not extend without limits, as it does now. We 
should be able to readjust it. 
  [Correspondent] In the 1995 administrative guidelines 
you submitted to the Legislative Yuan, you described this year 
as crucial for bridging the past and the future. You expressed 
your hopes that Taiwan would take an active part in 
international activities or bid for hosting international 
events. Do you have concrete plans for realizing these hopes? 
Also, there has been a steady stream of criticisms against our 
country for engaging in "checkbook diplomacy" at a time when it 
is actively expanding its niche in the international community. 
What are your views on these criticisms? 
  [Lien] This matter involves several issues. Only a few of 
the international conferences we plan to host this year are of 
an official nature due to our country's status. However, we can 
host many nongovernmental international events. For example, 
the International Rotary Club's plan to hold a large-scale event 
in Taipei, to be attended by 30,000 people, will afford us 
excellent opportunities because participants will be given to 
understand the ROC's progress. Other international events 
include our bid for hosting the East Asian Games and the Asian 
Games. However, these events require the host cities to 
undertake some obligations in advance, and the central 
government is prepared to cooperate fully. For this reason, most 
of our national construction plans concern the construction of 
sports facilities. With regard to so-called "checkbook 
diplomacy," Minister Chien has made our stand very clear over 
the past few days: Our approach toward developing bilateral 
relations is based on the spirit of mutual assistance, mutual 
benefit, and reciprocity. Criticism by people outside the 
government that the latter is engaging in "checkbook diplomacy" 
is very unfair. 
  In reality, economic, agricultural, and technical 
cooperation 
is our bargaining chip for expanding our diplomatic activities. 
This is something all countries can do openly. Why do people 
not criticize what the Chinese Communists do? Our situation is 
already difficult enough. I feel great sympathy for Foreign 
Minister Chien and his subordinates. They are really working 
hard, and people should encourage them.

<F P=106> [By reporter Xin Huaishi (6580 2037 2514)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 17 Feb (XINHUA) -- Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Wu Jianmin today announced Vice Premier Zhu Rongji's 
visit to Japan and Vice Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei's visit to 
four African nations, and fielded questions from reporters 
concerning Sino-U.S. relations, Sino-Japanese relations, the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea's [DPRK] nuclear issue, 
and Li Denghui's [Li Teng-hui] visit to Thailand. 
  At a press briefing this afternoon, the spokesman announced 
that Vice Premier Zhu Rongji will pay an official goodwill visit 
to Japan from 23 February to 3 March at the invitation of the 
Japanese Government. He said: The main objective of the visit 
is to exchange views with Japanese Government leaders and 
personages from various circles of life there on the development 
of bilateral relations. The visit aims to enhance mutual 
understanding, deepen friendship, and promote the further 
development of friendship and cooperation between the two 
countries in various fields. During his visit to Japan, China 
and Japan do not intend to sign any agreement. 
  The spokesman also announced that Vice Foreign Minister Tian 
Zengpei will visit Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Namibia at the 
invitation of these three countries' foreign ministries, and 
will visit South Africa as a guest of the Center for South 
Africa Studies of the Chinese Institute of International Studies 
in Pretoria from 20 February to 2 March. 
  A reporter asked: The Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 
the U.S. State Department for fiscal year 1994 has asserted that 
on the issue of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, the Taiwan Relations 
Act should supersede the Sino-U.S. Joint Communique issued on 17 
August 1982. What is your comment on this? 
  The spokesman said: The essence of the revised Taiwan 
Relations Act of the United States is to attempt to overrule the 
17 August joint communique between China and the United States 
and legalize U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. This is what the 
Chinese Government and people stand firmly opposed to. The 17 
August joint communique is an international agreement reached 
between the two governments of China and the United States, 
which the U.S. Government is obligated to strictly abide by in 
the principle that international laws prevail over domestic 
laws, and to take necessary measures to prevent the U.S. 
Congress from making any remarks and taking any actions which 
are in violation of this principle with a view to the 
maintenance of Sino-U.S. relations. 
  Another reporter asked: A Japanese magazine has asserted 
that China views Japan as a "major enemy in 20 years." Please 
comment on this. 
  The spokesman said: This assertion is untenable and is 
designed by a very small number of people to sow discord. It is 
the common aspiration of the two peoples to carry on 
Sino-Japanese friendly and cooperative relations from generation 
to generation, and it is a basic policy of the Chinese 
Government to develop friendly relations and cooperation with 
Japan in a sustained and stable manner on the basis of the five 
principles of peaceful coexistence. Long-standing friendship 
and cooperation between China and Japan will not only benefit 
the two countries, but also contribute to the stability and 
prosperity of the region and the world at large. 
  A reporter asked the spokesman to comment on a report that 
the DPRK has agreed to inspection of its nuclear facilities by 
the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
  The spokesman said: "We welcome this development, which has 
again shown that dialogue is the only correct way for solving 
the DPRK's nuclear issue. We hope that the parties directly 
concerned will continue to adopt a positive and constructive 
attitude and seek an appropriate solution to this issue at an 
early date through dialogue and consultation." 
  In response to a question about Li Denghui's visit to 
Thailand, the spokesman said: "The Chinese Foreign Ministry has 
made representations with Thailand and elucidated the solemn 
position of China on this matter."

  [Text] China's recent tax reforms are causing concern 
among Japanese investors at a time when they are planning to set 
up operations in the country, according to a Japanese certified 
public accountant. China has emerged as the favourite 
investment destination for Japanese companies with the opening 
up of its domestic market and a more favourable investment 
environment. Fuminori Nakamoto, a partner at Coopers and Lybrand 
(Japan), which advises Japanese campanies investing in Asia, 
noted that a recent seminar in Japan on China's tax reforms 
attracted 500 participants. "This is an indication of how much 
Japanese companies are interested in the tax reform in China and 
investments in the country," said Mr Nakamoto. He said Japanese 
companies had experienced different stages of investments in the 
U.S., Europe and Asia. Once-favourite places like Thailand were 
beginning to be hit by over-capacity, while new destinations 
such as Vietnam were still underdeveloped, forcing Japanese 
companies to look for other investment destinations. "There is 
no choice for them. Due to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar, 
they cannot survive in Japan, they have to move out of the 
country," he said. "At the moment, Japanese companies are 
becoming more confident about investing in China and it seems to 
be the only country for Japanese companies to invest," he said. 
He noted that Shanghai was a favourite destination for Japanese 
and other multinationals, while Dalian was also popular, with 
some 500 Japanese companies already in the city. 
  Mr Nakamoto said Japanese companies were manufacturing 
products in China for distribution in the local market. As a 
result, these companies would be particularly vulnerable to the 
value-added tax. Under the value-added tax regulations, products 
manufactured for export are entitled to a tax reduction, but no 
exemption is given to products for domestic sale. The revised 
individual income tax is also a major concern for Japanese 
investors. Although the Chinese Government is not seeking to 
increase tax revenue under the revised tax, individuals earning 
more than 44,800 yuan (about HK$39,420) a month will have to pay 
more tax. "For Japanese businessmen whose salary exceeds this 
amount, their individual income tax would increase. The tax 
would be paid by the employer which usually guarantees a net 
income for employees," said Mr Nakamoto. Despite these concerns 
Japanese companies are becoming more interested in China and are 
diversifying their investments from manufacturing into retail 
and service sectors.

  [Text] Senior Hong Kong-based Chinese officials yesterday 
repeated a warning against foreign intervention in Hong Kong 
affairs. That came after Australian officials proclaimed 
support for the electoral reforms of the Governor, Chris Patten. 
  Qin Wenjin, a deputy director of XINHUA (the New China News 
Agency), said the question of Hong Kong remained an issue 
between China and Britain prior to the changeover. After 1997, 
it would become purely an internal matter of China. "We have 
told the world time and again that no third country should have 
the right to make irresponsible comments or indiscreet remarks 
on the question of Hong Kong." Mr Qin was referring to praise 
by Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans for the political 
reform proposals of Mr Patten. 
  The Governor also received a similar reception at his 
meeting 
with other Australian ministers yesterday Mr Qin described Mr 
Patten's speech on Asia's human rights situation as "a tragedy" 
arising from misunderstanding. The Asian region had been 
subjected to colonial rule and its human rights sit uation and 
democracy should be developed step by step according to the 
development of individual areas. Mr Qin said. 
  Mr Patten is now in Melbourne on the final leg of his 
official tour of Australia. He flew from Canberra yesterday 
where he held meetings with the Governor-Ceneral of Australia 
Bill Hayden, the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee and the 
Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. 
Mr Patten also had a working lunch with senior academics of the 
Australian National University in Canberra. Last night, he was 
guest of honour at a dinner hosted by the Victorian State 
Minister for industry and employment, Philip Gude. Today Mr 
Patten will visit several prominent companies trading in Hong 
Kong and the Asian region as well as delivering what is being 
heralded as a significant address to the Committee for the 
Economic Development of Australia.

  [Text] Beijing, February 18 (XINHUA) -- Beginning Sunday, 
China will ban dumping of all kinds of radioactive wastes and 
disposal of industrial waste and incineration of industrial 
waste and sewage sludge in its sea waters, a Chinese official 
said here today. 
  According to Yang Wenhe, deputy-director of the State Bureau 
of Oceanography, the Chinese Government has accepted the terms 
of three international resolutions concerning disposal at sea of 
radioactive wastes and other radioactive matter and the phasing 
out of sea disposal of industrial waste and incineration at sea. 
  The resolutions were approved by member nations of the 
convention on the prevention of marine pollution by dumping 
wastes and other matter in London last November and will take 
effect on February 20, 1994. 
  "The approval and implementation of the three resolutions 
means a stricter global control of dumping of wastes at sea," 
Yang told XINHUA. 
  "China will strictly comply with the resolutions and 
implement them in letter and spirit," he said. 
  "China will ban the dumping of waste matters which do not 
conform to the standards set by the resolutions," he added. 
"disposing of wastes without license or dumping irresponsibly at 
sea will be punished severely according to law." 
  With special permission, disposal of low-level radioactive 
waste at sea is allowed, according to China's present "rules of 
controlling dumping at sea." Controlled low-level toxic or 
non-toxic industrial waste is also allowed to be dumped at sea 
with permission. But incineration at sea has never taken place 
in China. 
  "China will make necessary revisions of the rules and 
regulations concerned," Yang said. 
  According to the Chinese official, the dumping of wastes at 
sea has been under strict management and control in China, 
according to a system which includes application, examination, 
approval and issuing of permits. 
  The State Council has approved 38 dumping regions in China's 
sea waters. The major dumping material has been castoff from 
dredging, according to Yang. 
  "In recent years, no pollution accidents caused by dumping 
of 
waste in Chinese seas have occurred. Close monitoring also 
indicates that the water quality around the dumping regions 
remains fine," he said.

<F P=106> [By reporter Yan Liqiang (0917 0500 1730): "Development of </F>
Mountainous Areas Should Be and Can Be Accelerated"] 
  [Excerpts] Chen Xitong, secretary of the municipal party 
committee, recently visited the mountainous areas in Yanqing and 
Changping Counties to learn about the situation, salute local 
cadres and the masses, and discuss with them ways of making 
mountainous areas prosper. Chen Xitong pointed out that the key 
to accelerating the development of mountainous areas lies in 
emancipating the mind, opening wider, relaxing policies, and 
entering the market. 
  Chen Xitong as well as Yang Chaoshi, standing committee 
member of the municipal party committee, and responsible persons 
of pertinent committees and offices went to Yanqing County to 
the north of the Great Wall on 14 January. They heard reports 
by Liu Jinsheng, secretary of the county party committee, and Li 
Shuwang, head of the county, and gave speeches at the township 
enterprise work conference of the county. [passage omitted] 
  Chen Xitong pointed out: There are five major reasons why 
Yanqing County has not developed fast enough. First, it has not 
opened itself wide enough. The mountainous areas, in 
particular, have established few ties with the outside world and 
closed themselves for long periods of time, thus hindering their 
development of the economy and various undertakings. They 
should open their doors wider to other domestic areas and the 
foreign countries. Second, Yanqing has yet to fully develop its 
advantages. With 500,000 mu of cultivated land, Yanqing may take 
advantage of the difference in temperature to produce the grain, 
forestry products, fruits, and vegetables that meet market 
demand and march toward a modernized agriculture. It may also 
tap the potential in the mineral resources in the mountainous 
areas and its tourist resources. Third, its degree of 
industrialization is not high, and township enterprise 
development is sluggish. Two-thirds of its labor forces still 
feed themselves by farming and many labor forces have yet to 
free themselves from farming. It should regard 
industrialization as the fundamental way of development. Only 
when township enterprises are developed, can the labor forces be 
diverted from farming and the productivity improved. Fourth, 
Yanqing has not emancipated the mind fully enough. It should 
further emancipate the mind and note both its inferiority and 
superiority. It should uplift spirit, admit but not be 
reconciled to its backwardness, and work in a down-to-earth 
manner to change the backward outlook. Fifth, the municipality 
and pertinent departments have not provided sufficient 
assistance. They should render more help to accelerate 
Yanqing's development. [passage omitted] 
  On 15 January, Chen Xitong and others went to Changping 
County. They heard reports by Zhang Geng, secretary of the 
county party committee, and Li Shixiang, acting head of the 
county, and visited Heishanzhai and Xiazhuang Villages to learn 
about the situation. [passage omitted] 
  Cheng Xitong fully affirmed the development of these two 
villages. He pointed out: Heishanzhai Village has done it well 
to follow the idea of "developing mountainous area based on the 
reality of mountainous area; and leaving mountainous area (for 
planned localities) to develop mountainous area." Both villages 
have proceeded from their reality and their own advantages in 
resources to vigorously develop the fruits and mineral products 
that have bright market prospects. This reflects the 
development idea of "living off the mountain skillfully when 
living on the mountain and entering the market to achieve 
prosperity." Chen Xitong expressed satisfaction with Xiazhuang 
Village which boosted peasants' production enthusiasm through 
the leasing system, stressing the need to implement the 
guidelines of the municipal rural work conference and to relax 
policies to accelerate the development of mountainous areas, 
especially the old mountainous areas with economic difficulties.

  [Text] Lanzhou, February 18 (XINHUA) -- The appeal of 
remote northwest China, with its snow-covered mountains, vast 
prairies and deserts, colorful folk customs and ancient 
religious sites, is growing among domestic and overseas tourists. 
  Northwest China consists of Shaanxi, Gansu and Qinghai 
Provinces, and the Ningxia Hui and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous 
Regions. The area makes up one third of the total Chinese 
territory. 
  Over the past few years the three provinces and two 
autonomous regions have made active efforts to improve basic 
facilities and tap their tourism resources. 
  The endeavor has in turn brought about a rapid development 
of 
tourism in the area. Tourists of different nationalities are 
now common sights in the streets of the once desolate cities of 
the northwest. 
  Reliable statistics show that the area receives more than 
one 
million overseas tourists and several million domestic 
travellers a year. Tourism has now developed into an important 
source of revenue for northwest China. 
  For instance, in Shaanxi, which abounds in historic sites 
and 
cultural relics, earnings from tourism account for 10 percent of 
the local income. 
  Northwest China has 13,300 historic sites and scenic spots 
spread all over the region. 
  Gansu, dubbed a "treasure house of cultural relics", has 
opened 108 historic sites and scenic spots to overseas tourists. 
To cater to the growing trend of "returning to nature" the 
province built 24 forest parks of different styles in 1993 alone. 
  Qinghai Province, on the loess plateau, is not lagging 
behind 
its neighbors. Besides improving facilities at existing tourism 
resorts, the province has developed many new scenic spots. 
  Shaanxi has more than 300 new scenic spots. In addition, the 
province boasts over 2,020 places which enjoy key protection as 
historic sites or cultural relics. 
  Tourism programs with special features include expeditions 
to 
the sources of the Chang Jiang and Yellow rivers, hunting in the 
Qilian mountains, grotto and "roof of the world" tours and 
border market shopping trips. 
  Gansu has introduced 5.4 million U.S. dollars of foreign 
funds to develop local tourism resources. For example, a center 
for the protection, research and display of the Dunhuang 
grottoes treasures is funded partly by Japanese interests.

  [Text] A Boeing-737 airplane from Mainland China's 
Southwest Airlines was hijacked while en route from Changsha to 
Fuzhou this morning, and landed at Chiang Kai-shek Airport at 
1042 [0242 GMT]. It was the 11th Communist Chinese airliner 
hijacked to Taiwan since 6 April last year. 
  According to sources, there were 120 passengers and eight 
crew members on the Boeing-737 airliner bearing the serial 
number B-2599. At 1018, aviation control units from our Air 
Force spotted the airliner deviating from its route. The Tainan 
Air Base sent two F-5E fighters to guide the airliner to land. 
The authorities have instructed through proper channels that 
the matter be handled in accordance with the established 
principles. 
  Since the ninth Communist Chinese airliner was hijacked to 
Taiwan late last year, the government has lowered the level at 
which it will comment on airplane hijackings.

  [Text] Beijing, Feb 21 (AFP) -- China welcomed Monday what 
it described as the partial relaxation of tensions in Sarajevo 
after the United Nations said there was no immediate need for 
NATO military action around the besieged city. 
  "China welcomes the relaxation, to some extent, of the 
situation in Sarajevo," a foreign ministry spokesman said. 
  A NATO ultimatum set for 0000 GMT Monday requiring Bosnian 
Muslim and Serb forces to withdraw heavy weapons from around 
Sarajevo or face air strikes expired, with UN officials saying 
no immediate military action would be taken. 
  China, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, has 
repeatedly opposed the use of force in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
calling for a resolution of the situation through peaceful 
negotiation. 
  "We welcome all efforts by the international community that 
are conducive to relaxing the present tense situation in Bosnia 
and creating a favourable atmosphere for peaceful negotiations 
there," the spokesman said. "We hope that the parties concerned 
will make continued efforts to promote this process," he added.

  [Text] Geneva, February 21 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese 
representative to the UN Commission on Human Rights said today 
that the Amnesty International is highly prejudiced against 
China and therefore cannot truly understand the human rights 
situation in China. 
  Zhang Yishan, the Chinese representative, said at the 50th 
session of the U.N. Commission that some people's way of 
thinking remains the same as that of the Cold War era, although 
the world has already entered a new era. 
  "They don't try to create and develop an atmosphere of 
cooperation, but follow their old way of doing things, which is 
to make attacks and create confrontation," said Zhang. 
  He stressed that to help the Chinese people enjoy human 
rights in all fields has been the unwavering goal of the Chinese 
Government in the past several decades, and China has made a 
great many efforts in this area and has achieved a lot. 
  He said that China was known as a "land of hunger" in the 
world before New China was founded in 1949, and in 1946 alone, 
10 million Chinese died of hunger. 
  But now, China has succeeded in supplying food to 22 percent 
of the world population with only 7 percent of the world's 
arable land, he said. 
  Moreover, the average life age of Chinese people is 72, 
compared with 35 before liberation.

  [Text] London, February 18 (XINHUA) -- Britain and its NATO 
allies are "fully committed" to carrying out the threat of air 
strikes in Bosnia, a British minister said today. 
  According to a BBC TV report, Foreign Office Minister David 
Heathcoar-Amory told Parliament that the NATO's decision was 
clear. 
  And it was for U.N. commanders to determine the nature of 
how 
weapons remaining within 20 km of Sarajevo are to be controlled 
by U.N. troops, he added. 
  He said Russian shared with Britain and its NATO allies the 
same objective of lifting the siege of Sarajevo and bringing the 
conflict to an end. 
  Earlier, British prime minister said the past 48 hours in 
B-H 
had been encouraging. 
  Speaking on BBC radio, the prime minister expressed welcome 
to Russia's plan to deploy troops in Sarajevo and to persuade 
the Serbs withdraw heavy weapons by next Monday, as demanded 
under a U.N. ultimatum backed by NATO. 
  But he warned though air strikes now seemed less likely, no 
one should think the peace process was inevitable. 
  British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said if the Bosnian 
Serbs handed over their heavy weapons on time, it could pave the 
way for a new push for an overall peace in Bosnia.

  [Text] Washington, February 18 (XINHUA) -- President Bill 
Clinton notified Congress today that he is ready to order air 
strikes by U.S. planes in Bosnia-Herzegovina if the Serbs failed 
to meet the NATO deadline on Sunday [20 February]. 
  The notification came despite Washington's cautious optimism 
that the Serbs could remove all their heavy weapons from the 
20-kilometer exclusion zone before Sunday. 
  "I am cautiously, cautiously optimistic about the 
developments of the last few days," Defense Secretary William 
Perry said today. 
  Perry is scheduled to join defense chiefs of five other 
European allies for a meeting on Bosnia at the Aviano Air Base 
in Italy on Sunday before the NATO deadline expires. 
  The Bosnian Serbs announced that they would withdraw all 
heavy weapons from Sarajevo before Saturday, one day before the 
expiration of the NATO deadline, after Russia promised to send 
its troops to help implement the ceasefire in the city. 
  Washington welcomed Russia's efforts but insisted that no 
extension would be allowed for the NATO deadline. 
  "The important thing at this point is to see actions from 
the 
Serbs, because in the past we've seen plenty of words," State 
Department Spokesman Mike McCurry said. 
  There are reports that the Bosnian Serbs are pulling out 
mortars and other heavy weapons from the capital that they have 
surrounded for 22 months. 
  However, U.S. officials said reports from the ground were 
inconclusive and they would "wait and see" if the Serbs would 
indeed fully comply with the NATO ultimatum. 
  "There is no change in the NATO ultimatum at all," McCurry 
said. 
  "We will be watching very closely this weekend what the 
Serbs 
are doing to comply because they know exactly what they have to 
do, they know what will happen if they don't comply," he added. 
  At the White House, Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said, "The 
test will be their (the Serbs') actions on the ground." 
  "The test has not changed," Myers said. 
  Clinton told Congress that more than 60 aircraft are 
available for participation in the authorized NATO missions. 
  The formal notification followed a meeting of Clinton's top 
security staff at the White House on the Bosnian situation. 
  A war powers act requires the president to notify Congress 
any time he sends or plans to send U.S. troops to war.

  [Text] Belgrade, February 18 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Serbs are 
continuing their withdrawal of heavy weaponry from around 
Sarajevo to seven destinations selected by the United Nations. 
  Convoys of artillery can be seen moving along the highways 
outside Sarajevo. 
  Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said after a meeting 
with the U.N. Secretary General's Envoy Yasushi Akashi today 
that the Serbian side plans to complete withdrawal of heavy 
weaponry one day before the NATO deadline. 
  He said Serbs have removed several convoys of artillery from 
around Sarajevo, and are continuing doing that. He said those 
weaponry which cannot be removed because of the snowing weather 
will be put under control of the U.N. Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR). 
  Karadzic said that the U.N. side has promised not to let any 
other party get the upper hand following the Serbian withdrawal. 
  Predicting peace in Sarajevo in the near future, he 
expressed 
the hope that the model of demilitarization in Sarajevo will be 
used in other parts of Bosnia. 
  Yasushi said today that the UNPROFOR is monitoring the seven 
sites for concentrating weapons from both the Serb and Muslim 
sides. 
  Serbian sources said the Serbs have so far submitted more 
than 100 heavy guns to the UNPROFOR. 
  Yasushi said that the progress in weapon withdrawal is a 
good 
start and "We are moving towards a permanent ceasefire and the 
final goal of the demilitarization of Sarajevo." 
  Both UNPROFOR spokesman Bill Aikman and UNPROFOR Commander 
in 
Bosnia Michael Rose also confirmed reports of the ongoing Serbs' 
withdrawal of heavy guns from around Sarajevo. 
  The Bosnian Serbs accepted a Russian proposal to withdraw 
heavy guns and in the meantime to have 400 Russian troops, now 
serving in the UNPROFOR in Croatia, sent to Sarajevo. 
  Yasushi today also held a meeting with Bosnian Muslim leader 
Alija Izetbegovic. 
  Izetbegovic said after the meeting that the Muslim side will 
withdraw all of their heavy guns from around Sarajevo by 
February 19 and put a small number of their weapons under 
control of the UNPROFOR. 
  He also said the Muslim side will strictly observe the 
ceasefire and will not violate the military demarcation line. 
  Yasushi confirmed the statement by Izetbegovic. 
  Meanwhile, the U.N. secretary general's spokesman Joe Sills 
said in New York today that Butrus Butrus-Ghali is very much 
"satisfied" with the process of weapon withdrawal from Sarajevo. 
  Three thousand UNPROFOR soldiers are now being deployed in 
key positions across and around Sarajevo, mainly in the sites of 
weaponry submitted by both Serbs and Muslims, and along the 
demarcation line. 
  Ghali has called for a reinforcement of 3,000 UNPROFOR 
soldiers to guarantee the peace plan. 
  In the meantime, fighting is continuing with Serbs and 
Croats 
as one side, and Muslims as the other side in other parts of 
Bosnia.

  [Text] Brussels, February 18 (XINHUA) -- NATO is cautiously 
optimistic about the Serbian withdrawal of heavy weapons from 
around Sarajevo in compliance with the NATO ultimatum, a NATO 
spokesman said here today. 
  Although Bosnian Serb Forces have announced they are 
withdrawing their big guns from around Sarajevo, NATO's 
ultimatum is still in effect, he said. 
  News reports reaching here said that NATO Air Forces 
deployed 
in Italy are conducting training flights in preparation for 
possible strikes against Serb artillery positions. 
  Earlier today, Bosnian Serb leaders announced that Serb 
Forces will complete their withdrawal of heavy weapons from 
around Sarajevo before the NATO ultimatum expires by midnight 
GMT on Sunday [20 February], or will place them under the 
control of U.N. peacekeeping forces. 
  In return, the Bosnian Serbs have demanded that Russia send 
troops into Sarajevo to prevent the Bosnian Moslems from taking 
advantage of the Serb withdrawal. 
  Reports indicate that Bosnian Moslem Forces have also agreed 
to hand over their heavy weapons to U.N. peacekeeping forces. 
  Under the NATO ultimatum, artillery must be withdrawn from a 
20-kilometer exclusion zone, or put under U.N. control. 
  The Clinton administration has warned the Serbs there will 
be 
no extension of the deadline. 
  In New York, Joe Sills, spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali, said that the removal of Serb heavy weapons 
was "moving ahead at a very good pace." 
  He said the Moslem Forces were also complying with U.N. 
demands. 
  It is believed that Serb Forces have about 500 heavy 
artillery pieces. The Moslem Forces have fewer guns, but more 
infantry troops.

  [Text] Washington, February 18 (XINHUA) -- The United 
States would only participate in an international ministerial 
conference on Bosnia, suggested by Russia, when it is sure 
"where we are going," Secretary of State Warren Christopher said 
here today. 
  "I will not be prepared to agree to an international 
conference before we know where we are going," Christopher said 
during an appearance before the Cable News Network's "The World 
Today" program. 
  Earlier, Russia called for an international conference next 
week on the Bosnian crisis, which has left more than 40,000 
people dead since its outbreak 22 months ago. 
  "Before we have an international conference at the 
ministerial level or a high level," he said, "It needs to be 
well prepared so we don't get in this situation of building up 
expectations and then dashing them by not accomplishing 
anything." 
  On a related matter, he described as "flat wrong" the 
remarks 
by Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian presidential envoy on Bosnia, 
that if threatened NATO air strikes took place, it would lead to 
an all-out war. 
  "What we are trying to prevent is the expansion of the war. 
What we're trying to prevent is the end of the carnage there, I 
just think he has it wrong," Christopher said. 
  The secretary of state reiterated Washington's cautious 
optimism over the prospect of the Bosnian Serbs removing all 
their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo before the Sunday [20 
February] deadline as set by NATO. 
  He said some 50 pieces of Serb heavy weapons have been moved 
out of the Bosnian capital and reports on Thursday that they 
were removing the weapons in convoys still need to be verified. 
  "I'm cautious about this," he said. "The Serbs have 
disappointed us many times before." 
  The Bosnian Serbs announced that they would withdraw all 
heavy weapons from around Sarajevo before Saturday, one day 
before the expiry of the NATO deadline, after Russia promised to 
send its troops to help implement the ceasefire in the city. 
  "Although they've made some rather extravagant statement, 
we'll wait and see," Christopher said. 
  Also today, President Bill Clinton notified Congress that he 
was ready to order U.S. warplanes to launch air strikes against 
the Bosnian Serbs if they failed to meet the Sunday deadline. 
  He told Congress that more than 60 U.S. aircraft are 
available for participation in the authorized NATO missions. 
  The formal notification came after a meeting of Clinton's 
top 
security staff at the White House on the Bosnian crisis. 
  A war powers act requires the President to notify Congress 
any time he sends or plans to send U.S. forces to action.

<F P=106> ["U.S. Secretary of State Maintains Hard Line Stand on </F>
Bosnia" -- XINHUA Headline] 
  [Text] Washington, February 18 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher said today that the Bosnian Serbs 
have only withdrawn a minority of their heavy weapons from 
Sarajevo. 
  In an interview with the CNN Television Network, Christopher 
said, "We have information they have taken out probably 50 or so 
of the heavy weapons and we understand that they are beginning 
to move some additional weapons out ... [ellipses] It means 
that they've got lots more to take out. They've taken out only 
a minority." 
  He said U.S. President Bill Clinton would make a statement 
Saturday [19 February] morning on the possible air strike on 
Serb Forces in Bosnia, in which the United States Air Force will 
take part if it ever takes place. 
  "Right now, we're in a wait-and-see attitude... [ellipses as 
received] I am cautious about this. The Serbs have 
disappointed us many times before," said Christopher. 
  "There will be severe punishment if they (Serbs) don't 
comply 
with the NATO ultimatum. They will pay a very heavy price," 
Christopher added. 
  He also said that Russia's decision to deploy 400 troops in 
Sarajevo would not affect NATO's decision on air strikes. 
  He rejected Russia's warning that any air strike would lead 
to an all-out war in the Balkans, saying that the air strike 
would only end the "carnage" in Bosnia. 
  Meanwhile, U.S. President Bill Clinton met with his top 
advisors on Friday in the White House on the Bosnia situation.

  [Text] Moscow, February 19 (XINHUA) -- Russian deputy 
foreign minister and presidential envoy on Bosnia, Vitaliy 
Churkin, said today that any NATO air strike on Bosnian Serbs 
would lead to a real crisis in relations between Russia and the 
West. 
  In an interview with the Ostankino State Radio and 
Television 
Broadcasting Company, he said he had never accepted the NATO 
ultimatum on Bosnian Serbs as a way to solve the Bosnian crisis. 
  "What is this ultimatum? We are not a member of the NATO," 
Churkin said, adding that it is the action of the U.N. 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Sarajevo and the resolutions of 
the U.N. Security Council, not NATO, that count. 
  He said Russia and NATO are just beginning to learn how to 
establish "partnership for peace" and if NATO takes what he 
called "frivolous and absurd" action, a crisis could result in 
the Russo-NATO relations. 
  He also was confident that the crisis in Sarajevo would end 
with all sides accepting a Russian proposal, which calls for the 
withdrawal of heavy weaponry by both the Serb and Muslim sides 
and the dispatch of Russian peace keeping soldiers, now serving 
in the UNPROFOR in Croatia, to Sarajevo to guarantee peace.

  [Text] Bonn, February 20 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Muslim and 
Croatian leaders ended their peace talks tonight in Frankfurt 
with no substantial result achieved. 
  However, Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and Croatian 
Foreign Minister Mate Granic told the press after the meeting 
that the two sides had become much closer in their positions. 
  They described the negotiations as "very positive" although 
problems still exist. 
  They also said they were more confident of finding a 
solution 
to their conflict. 
  Both sides agreed to continue their talks next week. 
  The two sides told the press that today's meeting was about 
the future constitution of Bosnia, cease-fire between Croatians 
and Muslims and humanitarian issues. 
  But neither Granic nor Silajdzic disclosed the details of 
their talks. 
  However, Croatian Embassy Spokesman Zarko Plevnik said 
before 
the meeting that one topic would be a new map dividing Bosnia 
between Croats, Muslims and Serbs. 
  According to Granic, the two sides will first hold meetings 
at experts' level in the Croatian capital of Zagreb and then 
summit talks. 
  Silajdzic expressed the hope that the negotiations would be 
resumed after three or four days.

  [Text] Paris, February 19 (XINHUA) -- French Defense 
Minister Francois Leotard inspected on Saturday [19 February] 
the Foch Aircraft-Carrier in the Adriatic one day before the 
NATO deadline for air strikes in Bosnia, local media reported. 
  Leotard expressed his confidence about the developments in 
Sarajevo but said the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) 
would not abandon its threat to bomb Serb-controlled weapons 
around Sarajevo if they were not withdrawn or handed over to 
U.N. control by midnight GMT Sunday. 
  He told the ship's crew that the uncompromising attitude 
must 
be maintained and NATO would not change its position until the 
last moment. 
  But he added, "for the moment, things are going in a good 
direction." 
  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe also emphasized here 
today the tough stand taken by the French Government, which was 
the strongest advocate of military actions against Serb weapons 
around Sarajevo along with the United States. 
  The aircraft aboard the carrier are for regular 
reconnaissance flights above Bosnia, but the carrier has a more 
general mission to help protect and evacuate the 6,000 French 
U.N. peace-keeping troops deployed in the former Yugoslavia. 
  Meanwhile, French diplomats' families left Belgrade today. 
  A French military source said six Super Etendard aircraft 
out 
of a total of 18 would take part in the possible NATO attacks. 
  Leotard is expected to inspect another French squadron on 
Sunday at the Italian base in Istrana, near Venice, before 
meeting his U.S., British, Italian and Dutch counterparts in 
Aviano, northeast Italy, to assess the situation. 
  After that, he will consult Sunday afternoon in Paris with 
Juppe, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and President Francois 
Mitterrand.

  [Text] United Nations, February 20 (XINHUA) -- UN Special 
Envoy Yasushi Akashi said in Zagreb today that he had decided 
that it was not necessary to use air power against heavy weapon 
positions in and around Sarajevo, capital of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina. 
  In a statement he issued this evening, he said that "I am 
satisfied that we have achieved effective compliance with the 
requirement to remove or place under UN Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) all heavy weapons within the 20 kilometer Sarajevo 
exclusion zone." 
  Both the Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Serb side, he 
said, had been complying with the ceasefire agreement that was 
reached on February 9 between the two sides. 
  Before making the decision, he said, he had consulted with 
UN 
military commanders in the field, as well as leaders of the 
warring parties in Bosnia. 
  However, he said, "this is only the first step on a very 
difficult road, but we are determined to build on this 
development to achieve lasting peace for the suffering citizens 
of Sarajevo." 
  In the meantime, he said, UNPROFOR would continue to monitor 
compliance and any remaining verification required would be 
completed without delay. 
  "It is my hope," he said, "that the consolidation of a 
durable peace in Sarajevo is an example that will be followed in 
the other cities and towns of Bosnia and Herzegovina."

  [Text] Moscow, February 20 (XINHUA) -- Russian Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev said tonight that NATO will not start its 
first air strikes against Serb positions around Sarajevo after 
the three o'clock Moscow time deadline Monday [21 February]. 
  The Russian defense minister also told the Russian 
television 
program Itogi that he talked for an hour on phone with his U.S. 
Counterpart William Perry after a meeting of defense ministers 
from the U.S., Britain, France and the Netherlands. 
  "Fortunately, they listened to Russia," he said, adding he 
understood from the conversation that although the defense 
ministers hadn't made the last decision to deal with the 
situation after the midnight Sunday deadline, his impression was 
that there would be no immediate first-round air strike Monday. 
  The ministers would resume their meeting Monday to look into 
the progress of heavy weapon withdrawal and the remaining 
arsenals that the Serb side had failed to pull out because of 
the heavy snowfalls, Grachev said. 
  Meanwhile, he said, about 400 Russian peacekeepers had 
arrived in the Bosnia capital and would be deployed there. 
  The Russian deployment was part of an agreement with the 
Bosnian Serbs, who in turn are lifting the siege of Sarajevo.

  [Text] Moscow, February 20 (XINHUA) -- Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin and U.S. President Bill Clinton agreed hours 
before NATO's midnight Sunday [20 February] deadline to make 
joint efforts to prevent air strikes launched on Bosnia. 
  The decision was based on consideration of "the recent 
diplomatic efforts made by Russia" to defuse the Sarajevo 
crisis, said the Russian president's press secretary Pavel 
Voshchanov. 
  After conversations over the telephone, the two presidents 
agreed that it is up to the United Nations to mediate and make 
the decision upon the developments in Sarajevo, he said. 
  They decided to continue discussion over the solution of the 
bosnia issue as a whole in the near future. 
  Voshchanov declared that Clinton praised Yeltsin's proposal 
to seek a political settlement as one that can ease the tension 
of the crisis, which was fueled by the February-5 mortar 
shelling on the besieged Bosnian capital city in which 68 
civilians were killed and over 200 injured. 
  After that, NATO issued after a marathon session an 
ultimatum 
that asked Bosnian Serbs and Muslim forces to withdraw their 
heavy weapons from around Sarajevo and put them under United 
Nations control before midnight Sunday, or face NATO air strikes. 
  As the deadline was approaching, Moscow stepped up 
mediations 
and, as a result, Serbs began pulling back heavy guns on 
Thursday. 
  But heavy snow prevented a complete withdrawal or 
handing-over to the United Nations before the deadline, said 
U.N. Special Envoy in Bosnia Yasushi Akashi, who urged NATO not 
to hastily launch air strikes. 
  Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev assured in a 
television interview this evening that Bosnian Serbs will not be 
bombed when the NATO deadline is due. 
  He implied his confidence stemmed from an hour talk with 
U.S. 
Defense Minister William Perry over the telephone during the day 
and an earlier meeting of defense ministers from Western 
countries including the United States and Britain.

  [Text] Belgrade, February 20 (XINHUA) -- The president of 
the self-proclaimed "the Serb's Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina," 
Radovan Karadzic, said today that the withdrawal of heavy 
weapons from around Sarajevo is progressing smoothly and 
everything is going on as anticipated. 
  So far, the Serb side has removed 80 percent of its heavy 
weapons off Sarajevo and the rest probably won't go as is 
scheduled because of the road blockade after heavy snowfalls, 
reports said. 
  The UN peacekeeping forces offered gas and trucks to help 
Serbs carry on their weapons withdrawal, Karadzic said, adding 
that "so we hope everything will be accomplished as we have 
expected." 
  In a statement reported by the Belgrade radio today, speaker 
of "the Serb's republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina" Momcilo Krajisnik 
said both civilian and military leaders of the country had 
exerted the greatest efforts to prevent the worst from happening 
and foster peace in Sarajevo and throughout Bosnia. 
  "We took an audacious step by agreeing to withdraw our heavy 
weapons from around Sarajevo," he said. 
  "But we are not to demilitarize our troops, or hamper the 
interests of the Serbian people," he added. 
  The international community could see from the Serbs' choice 
who backs peace and who wants war, he said.

Boris Yeltsin and U.S. President Bill Clinton reached agreement 
Sunday [20 February] to avoid NATO air strikes on Bosnian Serb

said. 
  Yeltsin's Spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov told ITAR-TASS NEWS 
AGENCY that the two leaders reached the agreement during a 
telephone conversation Sunday. 
  "The result of the conversation was agreement in principle 
to

diplomatic efforts," he said. 
  "It was agreed to continue consultations on resolving the 
situation in Bosnia in the coming days," he said. 
  Earlier, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said that 
there would be no immediate nato air strike. 
  "After my conversation with Mr. Perry, I understood... There 
will be no strike tonight, unequivocally," the minister told the 
Russian television program Itogi after talking with U.S. Defense 
Secretary William Perry Sunday. 
  NATO has given Bosnian Serbs until Sunday 24:00 GMT to 
withdraw all heavy weapons from around Sarajevo or hand them 
over to U.N. control, saying that they would otherwise face air 
strikes.

  [Text] Sarajevo, February 20 (XINHUA) -- Continued heavy 
snow is hampering a full withdrawal of Serbian heavy weapons, 
and U.N. peacekeeper monitoring of all weapon sites around 
Sarajevo, with the NATO deadline only hours away. 
  The U.N. special envoy to Bosnia, Yakushi Akashi, told 
journalists here that because of heavy snowfall and road 
conditions, some weapons still inside the NATO exclusion zone 
around the city might not be under the "actual control" of the 
U.N. Protection Forces (Unprofor) by the deadline of midnight 
GMT Sunday [20 February]. 
  He said that the U.N. could do "a number of things" to make 
any weapons not under surveillance "non-operable." But he 
refused to give the percentage of weapons that had not been 
withdrawn or placed under U.N. control. "But this failure is 
not necessarily sufficient reason to call in air strikes," he 
added. 
  However, U.S. Army General John Shalikashvili, chairman of 
the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters, "...Any weapons 
remaining after the deadline within the 20 km circle that are 
not under U.N. control are subject to air strikes -- any. It 
didn't say 90 percent. It didn't say 26, (or) whatever." 
  Shalikashvili is travelling with Defense Secretary William 
Perry for a five-nation defense ministers meeting at Aviano 
airbase, Italy, at the 11th-hour before the midnight GMT 
deadline. 
  The final NATO pre-deadline strategy meeting was attended by 
defense ministers from the U.S., France, Britain, Italy, and the 
Netherlands. 
  Meanwhile, 400 Russian paratroopers and artillery forces 
were 
due to reach Sarajevo late Sunday morning for deployment in 
areas held by Bosnian Serb forces southeast of the capital, said 
Guy Vinnet, U.N. spokesman for the Sarajevo sector.

  [Text] Washington, February 20 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President 
Bill Clinton said here today that no air strikes on Bosnia are 
required at this time but urged vigilance after the passing of 
the NATO deadline. 
  In a statement read shortly after the expiry of the midnight 
GMT deadline as was set in a February 9 ultimatum by the NATO, 
Clinton warned that "all parties should be aware that the 
ultimatum stands." 
  "The deadline has not been extended," Clinton said, "NATO 
and 
the United Nations will continue to monitor compliance extremely 
carefully." 
  White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers, who read the 
Clinton statement, said "the vast majority of heavy weapons have 
either been moved from the zone or placed under UN control." 
  She was referring to the 20-kilometer heavy weapons 
exclusion 
zone in Sarajevo. 
  "Only a handful of areas remain outside UN control and we 
expect that very soon most or all of those will be within UN 
control," Myers said. 
  She said the U.S. and allies will continue to monitor the 
situations on the ground very carefully. 
  Clinton congratulated the UN and the NATO allies as well as 
Russia for their contributions in the Bosnian peace effort. 
  He said that "NATO's decision applies to any heavy weapon 
attacks on Sarajevo from within or beyond the zone." 
  On the diplomatic front, Clinton said, U.S. diplomats will 
be 
working with the warring parties and allies and partners to 
transform the potential of peace into reality. 
  During a 20-minute telephone conversation during the day 
between him and Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Clinton and 
Yeltsin agreed to send their aides to Bonn, Germany for 
consultations over Bosnia with others from France, Britain and 
Germany on Tuesday [22 February].

  [Text] Rome, February 21 (XINHUA) -- The commander of the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) over Bosnia said on 
Monday [21 February] that air strikes could still be launched if 
Sarajevo is shelled again or the big guns withdrawn after a 
Western ultimatum are brought back. 
  "Our mission is not over, any weapons found that are not 
under control will be subject to air strike," U.S. Admiral 
Jeremy Boorda, commander of NATO forces in southern Europe, told 
a news conference at his headquarters in Italy's Naples. 
  NATO demanded that all the heavy weapons in and around 
Sarajevo had to be withdrawn 20 kilometers from the center of 
Sarajevo or placed under U.N. control. 
  Boorda said that after the expiry of a NATO deadline at 
midnight GMT on Sunday, the threat of strikes from allied 
warplanes based in Italy or on aircraft carriers in the Adriatic 
remained in place. 
  He said air strikes could still be called in if the Serbs 
attempted to move guns into the exclusion zone around Sarajevo 
or recapture weapons surrendered to U.N. control, or shell the 
capital from beyond the zone. 
  The commander also indicated that he could be ready to 
extend 
the threat of air strikes to other areas of Bosnia if the 
alliance and the United Nations decided to deliver another 
ultimatum.

  [Text] Washington, February 21 (XINHUA) -- The Bosnian 
Government is prepared to accept a settlement that is "least 
unjust of all" but would not capitulate, visiting Prime Minister 
Haris Silajdzic said here today. 
  "We have accepted to reorganize our country into different 
units now in order to try and make a comprise," Silajdzic said 
during a photo session before talking with U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher. 
  For his part, Christopher said they would discuss the 
"reasonable requirements of Bosnia for a settlement that would 
get international approval, international acceptance." 
  Silajdzic praised the NATO ultimatum because "it restores 
the 
balance of powers in Bosnia." 
  "We believe that after this NATO ultimatum, nothing will be 
the same in Bosnia-Herzegovina," he said. "Where there is 
balance of powers, there is peace." 
  Washington has been sympathetic to the Bosnian Government, 
which is mainly comprised of Muslims, as the grieved side in the 
22-month bloody war in the former Yugoslav republic that left up 
to 40,000 people dead. 
  Russia, another major player in the Bosnian peace process, 
is 
pressuring Washington to exert its influence with the Muslims to 
accept a peace settlement. 
  However, Christopher emphasized, Washington "continues to 
feel that there should be no coercion on Bosnia, that we will 
not impose a settlement on them." 
  While praising Russia's contribution to the Bosnian Serbs' 
agreement to move away or put under UN control of all their 
heavy weapons in Sarajevo, Christopher repeated his belief that 
it was mainly the NATO ultimatum that did the trick. 
  "The principal responsibility for the good results achieved 
in Sarajevo has to be attributed to the resolve and 
determination of NATO," Christopher said. 
  Silajdzic will stay in Washington until Friday [25 February] 
before leaving for New York. He would also meet with 
congressional leaders in the coming days.

  [Text] Belgrade, February 21 (XINHUA) -- Bill Aikman, 
spokesman for the UN peacekeeping forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
said today that by the NATO deadline the bosnian serbs had 
surrendered 260 big guns to UN Forces. 
  The Serbs have also withdrawn most of their heavy weapons to 
areas 20 kilomaters away from sarajevo, and 23 of the 41 Serb 
positions have been dismilitarized, he added. 
  Nine other Serb positions have been supervised by UN 
military 
observers and the rest will be inspected by UN Commander General 
Michael Rose and the Commander of UN Forces in Sarajevo Andre 
Sulairu. 
  The Muslims also surrendered 45 heavy guns to UN forces, 
Aikman said. 
  The UN secretary-general's special envoy, Yasushi Akashi, 
declared in Zagreb that air strikes against Serb positions are 
unnecessary. 
  However, U.S. President Bill Clinton and NATO 
Secretary-General Manfred Woerner said NATO's threat remains in 
effect. 
  They stressed that any side opening fire or refusing to 
withdraw heavy weapons will be subject to NATO force. 
  Although the possibility of air strikes has temporarily 
faded, the military threat remains as NATO aircraft continue to 
closely monitor the situation in Sarajevo.

  [Text] Bonn, February 21 (XINHUA) -- German Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel said today that the NATO ultimatum to 
persuade the Serbs to withdraw their artillery from around 
Sarejevo had achieved its intended goal. 
  On a German radio program this morning, he said he was 
satisfied with the developments in Bosnia which have seen 
virtually all of the Bosnian Serbs' heavy weapons either moved 
to a location 20 kilometers or more from Sarajevo or controlled 
by United Nations forces. 
  But the German minister emphasized that the action was just 
a 
minor step towards future peace and added that fresh political 
talks should be resumed immediately. 
  He also called for vigilance in case the weapons moved away 
from the Bosnian capital city appear in other war zones of the 
country. 
  Kinkel expressed his hope that the progress achieved so far 
would turn out to be the start of a total solution of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict.

  [Text] Moscow, February 21 (XINHUA) -- Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin today listed the maintenance of the progress made 
in Sarajevo and UN control of the Bosnian capital as one of the 
three priorities at present in the effort to achieve peace in 
Bosnia. 
  In a telephone conversation with German Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl, he said the other two priorities were to take action to 
consolidate other safe areas in Bosnia and to urge the warring 
factions to reach an accord on a peaceful settlement based on 
the European Union (EU) plan. 
  According to the Russian president's press office, leaders 
of 
the two countries expressed support for an active UN role in 
resolving the Bosnian issue and said the proposal put forward by 
mediator states to end the conflict through political means was 
very important. 
  They hoped that the meeting of foreign ministers from 
Russia, 
the United States and EU member states, which is to be held 
Tuesday [22 February] in Bonn, would present specific measures 
for solving the Bosnian issue through political means. 
  Meanwhile, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev today 
reiterated Russia's hope that leaders from Russia, the United 
States, Britain, France and Germany would hold special talks on 
the Bosnian situation. 
  In a conversation over the telephone with his U.S. 
counterpart William Perry, he also suggested that defense 
ministers from these countries meet to discuss specific measures 
for resolving the Bosnia crisis. 
  The Russian television reported that Perry had rejected 
Grachev's proposal to send U.S. peacekeepers into Bosnia's 
Muslim-dominated areas, but said his country would discuss the 
matter with its Western allies.

  [Text] Budapest, February 21 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev stressed here today that it is most 
important to take advantage of the peaceful conditions in 
Sarajevo and extend the cease-fire to other parts of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  It was also necessary to maintain other UN protected areas 
-- 
referring to Mostar and Tuzla, the Russian minister, who arrived 
here today for a two-day visit, told a news conference after 
meeting with his Hungarian counterpart Geza Jeszenszky. 
  He added, however, that the final aim of the Russian 
government was the normalization of the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Moscow expected to achieve it with 
cooperation from the United States, the European Union and 
Germany. 
  Geza said the restoration of peace in Sarajevo was not only 
in the interests of Hungary and Russia, but also in the 
interests of the whole region and the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO). 
  There existed opportunities to extend the scope of the 
cease-fire, which would finally result in a political settlement 
of the conflict in the region, he noted. 
  Kozyrev is due to hold talks with Hungarian President Arpad 
Goncz and Prime Minister Peter Boros to discuss bilateral 
relations and the NATO threat of air strikes against Bosinan 
Serb positions around Sarajevo. 
  A NATO ultimatum for Bosnian Serbs to withdraw heavy weapons 
from around Sarajevo or face air strikes expired at 00:00 GMT 
Monday [21 February] but the NATO did not take immediate action.

  [Text] Washington, February 20 (XINHUA) -- Prime Minister 
Haris Silajdzic of Bosnia-Herzegovina will arrive here Monday 
[21 February] for talks with U.S. Government and Congress 
officials. 
  The visit comes only one day after the expiry of a NATO 
ultimatum for the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw or put under UN 
control all their heavy weapons in Sarajevo, or face NATO air 
strikes, which were deemed as unnecessary by NATO and UN 
officials "for the time being." 
  Accompanying Silajdzic will be Bosnian Parliament President 
Miro Lazovic and Presidency Member Ivo Komsic. 
  "The visit comes at a crucial moment for the future of the 
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and its people," the local 
Bosnian Embassy said. 
  Washington has been sympathetic with the Bosnian Government, 
which is comprised mainly of Muslims, the grieved side in the 
22- month war in the Yugoslav republic. 
  Appearing in an interview of the ABC Television, U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher said, "finding a rational 
settlement, finding one that is satisfactory to the Muslims, has 
to be a very high priority." 
  Christopher, who is scheduled to meet Silajdzic Monday 
morning, said Washington is trying to know what the Bosnian 
Muslims' "reasonable requirements" are and help them achieve 
them. 
  Silajdzic will stay in Washington for three days. He will 
first meet Deputy Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff and Assistant 
Secretary of State Stephen Oxman Monday morning. 
  The prime minister will have a second meeting with 
Christopher Thursday afternoon. 
  After their stay in Washington, Silajdzic and his entourage 
will go to New York Friday, the Bosnian Embassy said.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by staff reporter Hu Xijin (5170 6932 6651): </F>
"Can a NATO Air Strike Be Avoided?"] 
  [Text] Belgrade, 19 Feb (RENMIN RIBAO)--On 17 Feb, the 
Bosnian Serbs accepted Russia's proposal to solve the crisis in 
Sarajevo, and announced that they would withdraw all heavy 
weapons from the Sarajevo area or would place them under the 
supervision of UN troops. On 18 Feb, Bosnian Serb leader 
Karadzic announced that the process would be completed 24 hours 
before the deadline set by NATO's ultimatum. Izetbegovic, the 
Bosnian Muslim leader, after a meeting with UN peacekeepers on 
18 February, said that the Muslims would also withdraw their 
heavy weapons from Sarejevo or place them under the control of 
the UN peacekeeping forces from 19 February. He thought that the 
crisis in Sarajevo would be concluded very soon. The 
above-mentioned conditions hopefully provide some light for a 
peaceful settlement of the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
which is facing a crucial turning point. 
  Since NATO issued its ultimatum, which was mainly aimed at 
the Bosnian Serbs, and demanded that they withdraw all of their 
heavy weapons from an area with a 20-km radius surrounding 
Sarajevo by 0000 local time on 21 February, or place those 
weapons under the control of UN troops. Bosnian Serb leaders 
have repeatedly said they are willing to comply and that they 
started the process on 11 February, but that the scale was not 
large. According to an estimate by UN troops, the Bosnian Serbs 
have about 300 artillery pieces in the Sarajevo area, while the 
Muslims have about 150. By 14 February, artillery withdrawn by 
both sides or handed to the places specified by UN troops 
accounted for only about 10 percent. The Bosnian Serbs moved 
slowly, and the main reason was because they thought the 
Muslims, who have better infantry, were adjusting their lines in 
those areas evacuated by the Serbs; the Muslims were also slow 
to withdraw their heavy weapons, and there were differences 
between Serb political and military leaders on whether to 
continue the withdrawal. 
  When the Serbs hesitated and entered an impasse with the 
West, Churkin, a special envoy sent by Russian President 
Yeltsin, again arrived in Belgrade on 16 February carrying with 
him a proposal from the president, which said that if the Serbs 
withdrew all of their guns or accepted UN supervision, Russia 
would participate in the peacekeeping mission in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and would immediately send 400 Russian 
peacekeeping troops from Croatia to Sarajevo, and would add 
another 400 troops, who would guard positions vacated by the 
Serb gunners. This move by Russia satisfies the main demands of 
the NATO ultimatum on the one hand, and, on the other hand, 
enables the Serbs to have a sense of security and a path to back 
off, therefore, it immediately received a general welcome from 
various quarters, except the Bosnian Muslims, and it brought 
about important factors contributing to the development of 
situation. 
  Can bombing by the West of positions held by the Serbs be 
avoided? A spokesman with the UN peacekeeping forces said that 
the Serbs had begun a large-scale withdrawal of heavy weapons on 
17 February, while some other heavy weapons had been handed over 
at five designated points in Sarajevo; the Muslims were also 
handing over their heavy weapons at two other designated places, 
which would see the arrival of peacekeepers stationed there. 
Observers said that the possibility of an air strike had 
diminished, but the danger still remained. Although the Serbs 
declared that they would complete their withdrawal by 2400 on 19 
February, the NATO countries said they would "look at the 
results" when the deadline set by the ultimatum expires, and 
that "any heavy weapons which have not been withdrawn or placed 
under control will be hit immediately." In addition, in the 
past, incidents have erupted in Bosnia-Herzegovina at crucial 
moments, and the commander of the peacekeeping forces in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina has said repeatedly in the past two days that 
he was most worried about sudden incidents taking place at this 
time. Once vicious incidents erupt, it is difficult to deal with 
the situation. 
  Will NATO really take military action outside its defense 
zone for the first time since its founding? Can an air strike 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina be avoided? People are watching closely.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "If NATO Carries Out Air Strikes, the Negative </F>
Impact Will Be Great"] 
  [Text] The ultimatum sent by NATO to the Bosnian Serbs is 
going to expire at 0800 this morning (Hong Kong time). When 
readers read this newspaper, UN troops and NATO commanders 
should have made the final military assessment and decided 
whether or not Serbian troops have met the demands set by the 
ultimatum and whether or not NATO warplanes will bomb positions 
held by Serbian troops. 
  Two new situations have arisen at the 11th hour before 
making 
a decision: The first is Russia's diplomatic and military 
intervention and the Serbs' intended troop withdrawal, and the 
second is that the withdrawal of Serbian troops is hindered by 
heavy snow, and it is unlikely that the withdrawal can be 
completed on time. 
  It is understandable that heavy snow creates difficulties 
which make it impossible for the Serbs to complete the 
withdrawal within two or three days, and it will be even more 
difficult for UN and NATO authorities to examine whether or not 
Serbian troops have met the demands. Moreover, the fact that 
heavy snow has sealed mountain passes makes it easier for 
Serbian troops to stay in concealment. It is hard enough for 
NATO warplanes to find targets over boundless mountain forest, 
but now it is even more difficult to do so. NATO and Clinton 
asserted that the ultimatum would not be extended, but it is 
another matter whether or not air strikes will be launched 
immediately following the expiration of the ultimatum. 
  Russia's intervention helped Serbian troops back down, but 
also complicated the problem, which may bring about U.S.-Russian 
antagonism. U.S. President Clinton sets his diplomatic focus at 
keeping Russia on the "reform" course of leaning toward the 
West, particularly keeping Yeltsin's position since he has 
assumed office. Hence, Clinton met Yeltsin three times over the 
past year. However, nationalism is gaining ground and the 
balance of political forces has changed in Russia under the 
difficult situation. Therefore, Yeltsin has to take a high 
profile towards the Serbs, but dares not follow the West. In 
this way, if NATO and the United States wantonly take punitive 
actions against the Serbs, U.S.-Russian relations will 
definitely deteriorate and the political and economic situation 
of Russia will certainly be affected, thus impacting the overall 
international situation. 
  The Clinton administration has always wavered in dealing 
with 
the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina since it took power. In his 
presidential campaign, Clinton criticized Bush as weak and 
incompetent, saying that he would dispatch a shock brigade to 
march to the Sarajevo Airport. However, faced with the 
complicated situation of Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as acting 
under the constraints of allied powers and the U.S. people, all 
Clinton could do after assuming office was to air-drop food to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Now, in assuming airs of launching air strikes at whatever 
cost, Clinton has two things in mind: The first one is to 
coerce the Muslims to accept a political settlement package 
which will be even more unfavorable to them than the previous 
ones, and the second one is to seize the opportunity to increase 
U.S. influence in the Balkans. 
  Although it fails to control the worsening situation of 
former Yugoslavia, the United States has secretly penetrated its 
influence there. Last year, the United States successfully 
sought the approval of Albania in renting a naval base and 
stationing two spy aircraft there, and then dispatched 300 
troops, while flaunting the banner of UN forces, to Macedonia 
where conflicts would break out. It was reported that every week 
over the past few months, there has been a U.S. four-star 
general coming to Macedonia for inspection. Foreign journalists 
stated that these moves were certainly not as simple as 
inspiring troops' morale. 
  Hence, this explains why Yeltsin must make a quick response 
to the developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  NATO is assuming a strong posture and it seems that air 
strikes are imminent. However, viewed from the latest 
situation, the worst-case scenario can be averted. As the Serbs 
are "so wise as to suffer short-term losses" and are willing to 
cooperate with NATO, it is believed that the West is also 
willing to "back down after making small gains" in order to 
avoid armed clashes. 
  If the armed clashes do break out, the negative impact is 
obvious. First, bombs will lead to retaliation, the security of 
UN forces will be severely threatened, and humanitarian aid will 
have to be suspended again. Consequently, there will be greater 
casualties and more civilians will suffer. 
  Second, the Serbs may intensify their retaliatory attacks 
against other towns and areas after giving up their tactic of 
besieging Sarajevo, and the war may spread to Kosovo, a region 
mainly populated by Albanians, and to Macedonia. In this way 
the civil war of Bosnia-Herzegovina will develop into an 
international conflict, and Albania and Greece will be dragged 
into it. 
  Furthermore, even when air strikes helped rescue Sarajevo 
from the siege or put down the conflict between the Muslims and 
the Serbs, it does not imply that the civil war will be over. 
As a matter of fact, the war between the Muslims and the Croats 
is no less violent than that between the Muslims and the Serbs. 
Are NATO and the United States ready to intervene further? 
  It seems that the positive results of air strikes are 
limited, but the negative impact cannot be underestimated. NATO 
and the United States must deploy massive numbers of ground 
forces if they want to rely on armed strength to settle this 
civil war which has been fought for nearly two years. Are they 
ready to fight a "Desert Storm-type" large-scale war? Now, 
various countries in the West do not think so. 
  In any case, if NATO really launches air strikes today, it 
does not imply the immediate ending of the conflict in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina but rather the beginning of another round of 
more violent and complicated conflicts.

<F P=106> ["Newsletter from Bosnia-Herzegovina" by staff reporter Hu </F>
Xijin (5170 6932 6651): "`Before the Ultimatum 
Expires'--Situation in Sarajevo"] 
  [Text] Pale, 16 Feb (RENMIN RIBAO)--There are only a few 
days left before the NATO ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs expires 
at 0000 on 21 February. The day I hurried to Sarajevo was 
precisely the 10th anniversary of the 1984 Sarajevo Winter 
Olympics. Heavy snow covered the scars and wounds left by the 
war. Hotels in suburban Sarajevo under the control of the Serbs 
in Pale were packed, and many of the visitors were foreign 
reporters carrying luggage and cameras. 
  Air strikes was a popular topic everywhere. Some residents 
considered leaving their home for relatives elsewhere to take 
refuge for a while, because this time "the wolf" seemed to be 
really "coming." However, some people did not think much of it, 
believing that the West was once again "swashbuckling" to press 
the Serbs to make greater concessions. This reporter asked some 
Serb soldiers: "Would you attack UN peacekeeping troops should 
NATO really carry out air raids?" Some said no, and others said 
they would "fight selectively," and hit the "blue helmets" of 
those countries which sent their aircraft on air strikes. In an 
interview with a Serb leader, he said that the Serbs would do 
their best to settle the crisis through negotiations. Even if 
NATO launched air strikes, they would not give orders to attack 
UN peacekeeping troops. However, he stated that air strikes 
would result in a turbulent situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
mean "losing control over Serb soldiers"; consequently, UN 
troops would be endangered. 
  This reporter interviewed a family, comprising a mother and 
a 
daughter. The mother had already retired, and the daughter was 
a worker in a factory; for three months they had received no 
pension or wages. Every month, the daughter received some 
rations from the factory, while the mother only received six kg 
of flour, one kg of edible oil, and one kg of sugar from an 
international relief organization each month. They were so poor 
that they could not afford to buy toilet paper. The old lady 
took care of the child of a family, but received less than 2 
marks in return. The old lady said: "Now NATO will carry out 
air raids. Our house is located close to the television station; 
it is impossible to sleep well. They might as well withdraw the 
artillery troops." However, her daughter promptly objected: 
"We have already withdrawn one step; why should we have to make 
another concession? No. No way!" 
  Men in military uniform could be seen everywhere on the 
streets of Pale, because all male Bosnian Serbs must join the 
army. Even so, how could the Bosnian Serbs, with a population 
of 2 million, confront the powerful NATO? General Mladic, the 
Serb commander-in-chief, said that NATO had aircraft, and the 
Serbs had "whatever there is"; "NATO should not think that the 
war will come to an end by dropping a few bombs; they must send 
their ground forces here. Let them see how many big mountains 
and forests in Bosnia-Hercegovina await them." 
  It was getting very late, and snowy suburban Sarajevo was in 
the still of the night. Dull sounds of bombardment from 
Sarajevo city proper used to be heard here, but not this 
particular evening. This associated people with "the stillness 
on the eve of a big action." Many foreign reporters stationed in 
Belgrade have arrived here in haste and are ready to cover the 
scene of the air strikes; however, these are scenes people do 
not wish to see.

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Yang Huasheng (2799 5478 0581): </F>
"Quietness Is a Better Choice"] 
  [Text] At 0000 on 21 February (0800 Beijing time), the 
ultimatum issued by NATO to all warring parties in Bosnia- 
Herzegovina expired, and a rare silence prevailed in the 
snow-covered mountain forests around Sarajevo without any 
artillery fire, gunpowder smoke, or the sound of bomb blasts, 
which helped us recall a saying: "Quietness is a better choice." 
  It seems that people can stop worrying about the possibility 
that NATO would launch air strikes against positions held by the 
Bosnian Serbs. Why? Why did such a dramatic change prevail in 
the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina? To put it in a nutshell, 
the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is improving, and there have 
been a number of notable changes. 
  First, NATO issued its ultimatum on 9 February. After that, 
the warring parties in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, displayed 
a cooperative attitude and Moslems and Serbs swiftly reached a 
cease-fire agreement. In the following 10 days, the two sides 
abided by the agreement and Sarajevo was "at peace." From 17 
February onwards, Serbian troops started the massive withdrawal 
of artillery and other heavy weapons from areas around Sarajevo. 
On 18 February, Karadzic, leader of the Serbs, guaranteed at a 
meeting with UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi that they would 
effectively place their heavy weapons deployed in within 20 km 
of Sarajevo under the control of the UN Protection Force 
[UNPROFOR]. Although the withdrawal was blocked by heavy snow, 
it was obvious that the Serbs did their utmost to fulfill the 
requirements of the ultimatum. The Bosnian Moslem Army also 
agreed to place its heavy weapons, at the same time, under the 
control of UNPROFOR. 
  The reasons why the Serbs took this decision are: 1) They 
are "wise enough to know when to retreat" and they bear in mind 
that it is better to preserve their strength rather than be 
annihilated; 2) the Serbs have no alternative because the war, 
which has lasted for more than two years, has greatly undermined 
their armed strength, and they also need a breathing space; and, 
3), for the Serbs, the withdrawal of heavy weapons from areas 
around Sarajevo will not bring about fundamental changes in the 
balance of forces and they will still gain the upper hand. For 
the Moslems, the greatest advantage they gain from the 
withdrawal is that the siege of Sarajevo, which has lasted for 
more than 20 months, can be lifted. 
  Second, the fact that the Bosnian Serbs have changed their 
position is related to Russian mediation. On 15 February, 
Russian President Yeltsin told reporters emphatically after 
meeting with British Prime Minister Major that Russia could 
never be ruled out of a settlement of the problem of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Over the past few days, Churkin, President 
Yeltsin's special envoy, has kept mediating between the various 
parties involved in the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The 
armed forces of the Bosnian Serbs agreed to withdraw all heavy 
weapons from the area around Sarajevo, given that Russia would 
dispatch 800 blue helmets to Sarajevo, which was precisely the 
result achieved by Churkin when advising Karadzic, the leader of 
the Bosnian Serbs, to compromise. Now, people are realizing 
more and more that Russia is emerging as a new force in settling 
the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and that Russia should be 
treated with increasing respect. 
  Third, what should be mentioned is that after the artillery 
disaster happened in Sarajevo, the United States reversed its 
past "indifference" to the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
explicitly supported the ultimatum initiated by France, which 
indicated that differences between the United States and its 
NATO allies on the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina had narrowed. 
Observers held that the United States, its NATO allies, and the 
United Nations, by and large, jointly adopted the policy of 
"exerting pressure on all the warring parties in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to bring about change" to force the latter to 
again return to the negotiating table. However, both Europe and 
the United States stressed that the threat of air strikes was 
absolutely not "bluff and bluster" but that they "would live up 
to their word," otherwise the operational capability and 
credibility of the United States, NATO, and the United States 
would be doubted by the international community. 
  Fourth, France, Britain, and other West European countries 
have, to different degrees, adjusted their original positions 
and sought common ground while reserving differences with the 
United States because, as proven by the past year or so, it is 
difficult for the European countries to settle the crisis of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina alone. Now, the West European countries have 
no alternative but to acknowledge that without the active 
participation of the United States and Russia, it will 
ultimately be difficult to settle the conflict in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Hence, Britain and France wish to encourage 
the United States and Russia to bring their respective influence 
over Bosnian Moslems and Serbs into play to seek an effective 
way to settle the conflict. 
  At this moment, there is no artillery fire in Sarajevo, and 
it is obvious that reason has prevailed on all of the parties 
concerned. However, NATO has not completely revoked its 
ultimatum. Although there is no gunpowder smoke, the problem 
still exists. Obviously, NATO is determined to maintain its 
high-handed posture over all of the parties involved in the 
conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina and to let the sword of Damocles 
hang above their heads so that none dares make a reckless move.

  [Text] Beijing, February 21 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman 
of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress 
[NPC], met here today with Sakhat Muradov, chairman of the Grand 
National Assembly of Turkmenistan. 
  During the meeting, Qiao said that China hopes to maintain 
the good-neighborly relations with Turkmenistan on the basis of 
the five principles of peaceful co-existence and to strengthen 
cooperation with it in various fields including politics, 
economy, science and technology, culture and education. 
  Qiao Shi said that China's cooperation with foreign 
countries 
has been greatly enhanced over the past 15 years when China has 
been implementing the reform and open policy and the country has 
made great achievements in the introduction of foreign funds and 
technology. 
  Briefing the guests on China's legislative system, Qiao said 
that the NPC has played a major role in promoting the country's 
building of democracy and the legal system. 
  It is necessary to draw on foreign experience in the 
development of both democratic politics and the economy, Qiao 
said. But that does not mean copying foreign models wholesale 
and every country has to develop according to its own conditions. 
  Muradov said that Turkmenistan attaches much importance to 
developing relations with China and is closely watching China's 
economic growth, adding that China's experience might be useful 
in developing its own economy. 
  During the meeting, the two sides expressed the hope for 
increasing exchanges between the two parliaments in the future.

  [Text] Beijing, 21 Feb (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of 
the National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee, met 
with Sakhat Nepesovich Muradov, chairman of the Turkmen Grand 
National Assembly, and his delegation at the Great Hall of the 
People this afternoon. 
  Muradov and his delegation arrived in Beijing on 20 February 
for a six-day visit to China at the invitation of the NPC 
Standing Committee. This is the first Turkmen parliamentary 
delegation to visit China since Turkmenistan became independent. 
  Qiao Shi extended his warm welcome to the delegation. He 
said: China and Turkmenistan are near neighbors. China hopes to 
establish good-neighborly and friendly relations with 
Turkmenistan on the basis of the five principles of peaceful 
coexistence, and to increase friendly relations and cooperation 
in various fields -- political, economic, scientific and 
technological, cultural, and educational. He expressed his 
belief that the delegation's visit would enhance friendship and 
understanding between the two peoples. 
  Qiao Shi said: China has undergone tremendous changes during 
the past 15 years of reform and opening up. Its cooperation 
with other countries also has increased significantly, achieving 
world-renowned results in introducing foreign funds and 
technology. In briefing the guests on China's people's congress 
system, he said: China's NPC has played an important role in 
promoting the country's democracy and legal system. 
  Qiao Shi said: China has to draw on foreign experience, 
whether in developing democratic politics or the economy. It 
cannot, however, indiscriminately copy foreign models and must 
proceed according to its own national conditions. 
  Muradov said: Turkmenistan attaches importance to developing 
relations with China and is closely following China's economic 
development. This is because China's experience can serve as a 
reference for Turkmenistan's economic development. 
  During the meeting, the two sides expressed hopes for 
further 
strengthening exchanges between the two parliaments in the 
future. 
  Other than Beijing, the delegation also will tour Tianjin 
and 
other areas. Tomur Dawamat, vice chairman of the NPC Standing 
Committee, and others were present at the meeting.

  [Text] Athens, February 18 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev said today that the Bosnian Serb 
decision to pull back their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo 
signaled that the Bosnian war is coming to an end. 
  He added: "I am satisfied with their response. President 
Yeltsin is at this moment speaking over the phone to German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and extensive phone calls are being made 
to other ministries." 
  "There is now a growing mood to seize the momentum and end 
the war," Kozyrev said further. 
  Kozyrev stressed that it is important for Russia to 
encourage 
the Serbs keep to the agreement and for the U.S. and other 
nations to persuade the opposing sides not to try and exploit 
the Serbian withdrawal but use the situation as the chance for 
opening peace talks. 
  He added that it was now most important for joint efforts to 
be made to bring the warring sides to a real peace compromise. 
  Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said yesterday that the 
Serbs had agreed to withdraw heavy weapons from around Sarajevo 
after Russia pledged to provide 400 troops in the area. 
  "We do think that the war in Sarajevo is finally over," 
Karadzic said in the city of Pale, close to Sarajevo. 
  NATO is threatening the Bosnian Serbs with air strikes 
unless 
they neutralize or remove heavy guns around Sarajevo by midnight 
on Sunday. 
  After a meeting in Athens with German Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel, Kozyrev told reporters last night that the Serbs had 
agreed to pull back all heavy artillery following an appeal by 
Russian President Yeltsin and his pledge to send Russian 
peacekeeping troops to the area. 
  Kinkel and Kozyrev are here to attend the crucial EU troika 
meeting this morning with their Greek and Belgian counterparts 
Karolos Papoulias and Willy Claes, to discuss the Bosnian crisis. 
  U.S. Special Envoy to the former Yugoslavia Charles Redman, 
who arrived yesterday unexpectedly in Athens, will also attend 
the meeting.

current favorable momentum in bilateral relations and make joint 
efforts based on concrete reality to put bilateral ties on the 
correct path as soon as possible.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Korea has Agreed to International </F>
Atomic Energy Agency Inspection of Nuclear Sites"] 
  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], in a 
statement issued in Vienna on 15 February, announced that the 
DPRK had agreed to IAEA inspection of seven nuclear sites in the 
Korean territory. 
  The talks and negotiations between the IAEA and the Korean 
Government had been interrupted for as long as three weeks 
before the agreement was made on 15 February. Going through the 
interpretation and announcement of the nuclear inspection 
activities of the IAEA, the Korean representative to the IAEA 
said that he, on behalf of the Korean Government, informs the 
IAEA that the Korean Government agrees to the inspection. 
  According to the agreement made by the two sides, the main 
objective of the IAEA inspection team is to verify whether the 
Korean side did not (?transfer) material from the seven nuclear 
sites, which the Korean side declared after the previous 
inspection activities. To facilitate the inspection work 
henceforth, the Korean side is to allow the inspection team to 
take photographs of these seven designated nuclear sites again 
and to inspect again some nuclear facilities that the inspection 
officials had sealed. 
  However, the agreement between the two sides does not 
include 
the provision that the Korean side will allow the IAEA 
inspection team to inspect the two nuclear sites near Pyongyang 
which the Western officials regard as secret nuclear weapon 
production bases. An IAEA official welcomed the Korean decision 
and said that the inspection activities will begin next week at 
the latest. 
  The United States and the ROK welcomed the agreement as soon 
as it was announced. A spokesman for the U.S. State Department 
said that this was a necessary and positive step and would help 
the IAEA precisely grasp the status of the Korean nuclear sites. 
He added that a satisfactory result of the inspection and the 
resumption of the inter-Korean dialogue on the denuclearization 
of the Korean peninsula would facilitate the next round of 
U.S.-Korean negotiations. ROK media noted the possibility of 
U.S. suspension of the U.S.-ROK Team Spirit joint military 
exercise this year in view of the positive Korean attitude, in 
addition to the possibility of reconsidering the plan to deploy 
Patriot missiles to the ROK. 
  Korea has adamantly refused to admit that the nuclear sites 
in the Korean territory are used for the production of nuclear 
weapons, and at one time rejected IAEA inspections. The 
negotiations between the IAEA and Korea on the nuclear sites was 
interrupted by the Korean declaration in March 1993 that it 
would withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. U.S. 
and Korean delegates held 18 rounds of unofficial talks on 
nuclear inspection during the second half of last year, finally 
reaching agreement. 
  The agreement is as follows: Korea agrees, in principle, to 
the inspection of seven Korean nuclear sites by the IAEA. In 
return, the United States will call off the ROK-U.S. Team Spirit 
joint military exercise for 1994. On the basis of this 
principle, the two sides agreed to prepare for the third round 
of official high-level talks to discuss the issue of improving 
Korean-U.S. relations. 
  However, after the United States had announced its plan to 
deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK, Korea withdrew its agreement 
to the nuclear inspection. 
  As to how to resolve the issue of the inspections of the 
nuclear sites in the Korean territory, the Western countries 
called for a tough stance of putting pressure and applying 
sanctions on Korea. Nevertheless, the Korean leaders said that 
the Korean Government and people would never submit to the 
Western pressure and threats. 
  The result of the negotiations between the Korean Government 
and the IAEA proves that dialogue is the only effective way to 
settle an international dispute. The Korean Government's 
decision will be beneficial to the security and stability on the 
Korean peninsula and Northeast Asia as a whole.

  [Text] Pyongyang, 21 Feb (XINHUA) -- Korea's [DPRK] 
Committee for Cultural Relations With Foreign Countries and 
Civil Aviation Bureau hosted a banquet today to mark the 35th 
anniversary of the "Sino-Korean Agreement on Cultural 
Cooperation" and the "Sino-Korean Agreement on Air Transport." 
  Speaking at the banquet, Chong Chun-ki, chairman of Korea's 
Committee for Cultural Relations With Foreign Countries, said: 
The past 35 years have witnessed numerous cultural exchanges 
between Korea and China. These exchanges have contributed to 
socialist construction in both countries, greatly developed the 
civil aviation sectors of the two countries, and strengthened 
the bonds of friendship between the two countries. 
  Chong Chun-ki said: The Chinese people have scored 
tremendous success in its quest for social stability and 
socialism with their own characteristics. The Korean people are 
very glad about this, and would like to wish China smooth 
progress in all its undertakings. He expressed the belief that 
joint efforts by the two peoples would help constantly develop 
the traditional Korean-Chinese friendship. 
  Ning Fukui, Chinese charge d'affaires ad interim in Korea, 
attended the banquet. 
  The "Sino-Korean Agreement on Cultural Cooperation" and the 
"Sino-Korean Agreement on Air Transport" were signed on 21 and 
18 February 1959, respectively.

economic development cooperation fund (EDCF) to China this year, 
a government official said here today.

coastal city of Tianjin, harbor expansion in the eastern 
province of Shandong, and railroad facilities and airport 
communications and control facilities in northeastern province 
of Heilongjiang. 
  The official added that Seoul made the decision after a 
feasibility study of the projects by a fact-finding team sent to 
China toward the end of last year.

Vice-Premier and foreign minister Qian Qichen arrived here this 
evening on a four-day official good-will visit to Pakistan. 
  Pakistan is the first leg of his fortnight official visit to 
five Asian countries including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives

  Qian was greeted by Pakistan Foreign Minister Sardar Asif 
Ahmad Ali and Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Zhou Gang at 
Islamabad International Airport. 
  In a written statement issued at the airport, Qian said 
Sino-Pakistan friendship is time-tested. 
  He said since the establishment of diplomatic relations 
between the two countries over 40 years ago, bilateral ties have 
seen an all around development and serve as a model of state to 
state relations. 
  It is the unswerving policy of the Chinese Government to 
further strengthen the friendship and cooperation between the 
two countries which are not only in the interest of our two 
peoples but also conducive to the maintenance of peace and 
stability in this region and Asia as a whole, he said. 
  "I believe that my current visit will serve to enhance our 
mutual understanding, deepen our friendship, expand our 
cooperation and push the existing friendly relations and 
cooperation between the two countries to a new height," he said.

<F P=106> [By Jonathan Braude in Jerusalem] </F>
  [Text] Irit Ben-Abba, China desk officer of the Israeli 
Foreign Ministry, is enthusiastic about her country's growing 
relationship with Beijing. "We are very satisfied. We didn't 
expect it to be that warm so quickly," she says, just two years 
after diplomatic relations were established. 
  With the first flush of high-level contacts now over, the 
excitement and romance of the Sino-Israel honeymoon has begun to 
wear off. Diplomacy is now aimed at the practical co-operation 
essential to the success of the marriage. When Israeli 
Economics and Planning Minister, Shim'on Shetrit, arrives in 
Beijing today for an eight day visit, he will not be discussing 
glamorous international affairs, but comparing notes on the 
development of free-trade zones, privatisation of state 
enterprises, inflation control, and regional development. "We 
will be bringing a message of mutual co-operation and respect, 
not telling them we know best," he told the South China Morning 
Post. 
  The visit, at the invitation of Zou Jiahua, vice premier and 
head of the State Planning Commission, is an indication that 
ties are normal and continuing to grow steadily. 
  Officials and academic observers seem surprised by reports 
from Hong Kong of a three-month cooling of relations after a 
helicopter crash in Israel last November killed the visiting 
Mayor of Shenyang. The crash, said Ms Ben Abba, also killed 
three Israelis and nobody suspected foul play. A report on the 
incident is expected to blame the incident on an engine fault. 
"The Chinese understand accidents like this happen," she said. 
  On another level, however, it is evident there has been some 
disappointment on both sides with the concrete results of two 
years of Commentary on-operation. "It's because expectations 
were too high in the first place," said Yitzhaq Shichor, 
associate professor at the Department of East Asian Studies of 
the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Israel is disappointed at 
China's continued sales of arms and weapons technology to Iran 
and the Arab countries, although Foreign Ministry officials 
believe China has kept its pledge not to supply missiles to Iran.

  [Text] Beijing, February 21 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng and visiting Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar agreed 
here today that the bilateral relations between China and 
Slovakia have developed smoothly in various fields over the past 
year and new avenues should be opened up for expanding the 
cooperation. 
  Prime Minister Meciar is the first Slovak leader to visit 
China since the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two 
countries a year ago. 
  Such high-level contacts and direct dialogue are of great 
importance in deepening mutual understanding and trust and in 
promoting cooperation, Li said. 
  Meciar thanked China for taking the lead in recognizing 
Slovakia. 
  He said that China is an important country and Slovakia is a 
reliable partner of cooperation and there is no problems in 
their cooperation. 
  Li Peng said the Sino-Slovak agreement on economic 
cooperation and trade signed earlier today will provide a firm 
basis for expanding economic cooperation and trade. 
  He urged economic and trade departments of the two countries 
to explore more practical ways of boosting bilateral economic 
ties. 
  Meciar briefed Li on the political and economic situation in 
Slovakia after it gained independence. 
  He showed his admiration for China's achievements in the 
reform and opening up and hoped to know more about China during 
his current visit. 
  Li told the visitor that China's economic reform has been 
going on hand in hand with political reform, and China has been 
very careful in handling the relations between reform, 
development and stability. 
  In the course of fast economic growth, he continued, China 
has scored remarkable successes in resolving new contradictions 
and problems by strengthening and improving macroeconomic 
control and regulation. 
  He told the visitor that China's reform policies have been 
formulated in the light of China's own conditions. 
  "It is impossible for all countries to follow the same 
economic model or take the same development road," Li said. "One 
country's practice and experience can serve only as reference 
for others." 
  Reiterating Slovakia's "one China" policy, Meciar said that 
the Government of the People's Republic of China is the only 
legitimate government of China and Slovakia will have no 
official relations with Taiwan. 
  Li praised Slovakia for taking such a position. 
  Before the talk, Premier Li hosted a ceremony to welcome 
Meciar. 
  Slovakia's Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Kozlik, Deputy Prime 
Minister and Finance Minister Julius Toth as well as other 
senior officials, together with Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing 
and other senior officials, were present at the ceremony. 
  Prime Minister Meciar arrived in Beijing yesterday afternoon 
to pay a five-day visit to China. 
  This evening, Li hosted a banquet in honor of Slovak Prime 
Minister Meciar and his party at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse. 
  In the afternoon, Li Tieying, Chinese State Councillor and 
minister in charge of the State Commission for Restructuring the 
Economy, exchanged views with Slovak Deputy Prime Minister 
Sergei Kozlik.

  [Text] Beijing, February 21 (XINHUA) -- China respects the 
choices made by Slovakia and other East European nations in

  He wishes Slovakia and other East European countries 
political stability and economic prosperity and their people a 
happy life. 
  During a meeting with visiting Slovak Prime Minister 
Vladimir 
Meciar here this afternoon, the Chinese president said that

  Jiang said China takes a positive attitude towards the

science and technology, culture and other fields. 
  With the common efforts of the two countries, the friendly 
ties of cooperation between China and Slovakia will surely 
attain sustained development in all spheres, Jiang noted. 
  Meciar said China is playing a more and more important role 
on the world stage and Slovakia attaches importance to 
developing its traditional ties with China. 
  No problems exist in direct relations between the two 
countries and their cooperative relations in all fields will 
gain new development, he noted. 
  Meciar said the gradual process of reform and development 
China has chosen is right and its experience is worth learning.

regional

  [Text] Hong Kong, February 18 (XINHUA) -- A senior Hong 
Kong-based Chinese official has condemned the British attempt to 
grab the maximum possible economic benefits before it leaves 
Hong Kong. 
  Such deeds on the British side infringed on the interests of 
Hong Kong residents and creates an economic burden for Hong 
Kong's future administration, said Zhu Yucheng, deputy director 
of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong branch, after attending a 
spring festival cocktail reception held here Thursday [17 
February]. 
  He called on local residents to heighten their vigilance on 
this matter. 
  He pointed out that the aim of the British side in its 
financing arrangements for the new Hong Kong airport is to spend 
money to the maximum extent and shift debts onto the future 
government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR). 
  According to the Sino-British Memorandum of Understanding on 
the Construction of the New Airport in Hong Kong [HK], the total 
amount of debt on the ten airport core projects to be repaid 
after June 30, 1997 should not exceed five billion. 
  However, Zhu said, the British side has tried every possible 
means to outgrow this limit in a bid to leave a big burden for 
the future SAR government. The fourth financial plan put 
forward by the British side still aims at imposing a debt of 23 
billion HK dollars (2.9 billion U.S. dollars) on the future SAR 
government. 
  Zhu said that it is not convincing for the Hong Kong 
Government to describe the debt borrowed by the Provisional 
Airport Authority (PAA) and the Mass Transit Railway Corporation 
(MTRC) on the airport construction as non-government debt. 
  The above-mentioned two units are government-funded and the 
Hong Kong Government serves as the sole shareholder of these two 
units. Therefore, the Hong Kong Government is, of course, 
responsible for the refunding of the debt, the deputy director 
said.

<F P=106> ["Zhu Yucheng Criticizes British Side for Grabbing Maximum </F>
Economic Benefits Before Leaving Hong Kong" -- XINHUA headline] 
  [Text] Hong Kong 19 Feb (XINHUA) -- On a public occasion, 
Zhu Yucheng, deputy director of XINHUA's Hong Kong Branch, 
criticized the British side's attempt to grab the maximum 
economic benefits from Hong Kong before its withdrawal. 
  While attending a cocktail party hosted by the Chinese 
General Commercial Chamber to mark the spring festival, Zhu 
Yucheng indicated to reporters that this behavior by the British 
side would injure the overall interests of Hong Kong residents 
and result in burdening Hong Kong's economy, so Hong Kong 
residents must heighten their vigilance against it. 
  Zhu Yucheng said that the crux to the financial arrangements 
for the new airport was that the British side all along had 
wanted to spend money to the maximum, and to leave the debts 
incurred to the future special administrative region [SAR] 
government. The Sino-British Memorandum of Understanding on the 
New Airport and Related Issues already has stipulated explicitly 
that the debts incurred by the 10 core projects in building the 
new airport should not exceed HK$5 billion, but the British side 
all along has tried its best to break through this ceiling, and 
the financial plans it set out always aimed at leaving the 
financial burden to the SAR government. The fourth set of 
financial plans put forward by the British side continued to 
show that it wanted to shift HK$23 billion in debts onto the SAR 
government. 
  Zhu Yucheng indicated that the British Hong Kong Government 
regarded the loans made by Hong Kong Airport Administration and 
MTR Company, which were spent in building the new airport, as 
non-governmental debts, but that was not convincing because both 
the aforesaid organizations are fully owned by the British Hong 
Kong Government, which is the sole shareholder in those two 
organizations. Naturally, the Hong Kong Government must bear 
responsibility for its debts. In actual fact, with the transfer 
of government in 1997, the tremendous sum of debts of those two 
organizations inevitably will result in pressure on Hong Kong's 
finances, which will be shifted onto the future SAR government. 
Beyond a doubt, it is none other than Hong Kong's taxpayers who 
will bear the burden in the final analysis. 
  Zhu Yucheng added that the British side had used up all its 
tricks in making arrangements for use of the reclaimed land in 
the Chek Lap Kok project, in an attempt to profit by 
disturbances, while seizing the power to approve 100 hectares of 
land exclusively. Regarding the issue of selling plots of land 
along the railway, likewise, the British side excluded them from 
the annual plan for land approval, and did its best to sell land 
for cash.

<F P=106> [By Fanny Wong] </F>
  [Text] Britain went on the offensive yesterday in the 
dispute over whether or not details of 17 rounds of secret talks 
with China on the 1994/95 electoral arrangements should be 
published next week, claiming that the Beijing Government had 
already leaked its own version of the negotiations. The 
mainland edition of the People's Daily on January 7 contained 
very long accounts from an anonymous official about the talks, 
the Governor's spokesman, Mike Hanson, said. He said it was, 
therefore, "very surprising" that China should issue a statement 
saying it was dissatisfied that the British administration had 
rejected "consultation" on releasing the contents of diplomatic 
negotiations. 
  A mainland official said on Thursday that the British side 
had not sought a discussion with the Chinese side on the 
disclosure of these details and such a unilateral move was 
inappropriate. But Mr Hanson said that in early December, both 
the Director of the Chinese State Council's Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office, Lu Ping, and local Xinhua director, Zhou Nan, 
had challenged Mr Patten to reveal what had happened in the 
talks. 
  He would not say whether the Government would go ahead and 
publish a White Paper outlining the negotiations and only 
reiterated that the Governor had made clear on several occasions 
that Hong Kong people would be given a full account. It is 
understood, however, that the Executive Council will be asked to 
formally endorse the final draft of the White Paper on Tuesday 
and that it will be published on either Thursday or Friday. 
  As well as this dispute, Mr Patten plans to ignore China's 
objections and any concessions that might have been offered in 
the talks and table his original constitutional package to 
legislators. 
  Among proposals in his Policy Speech in 1992 were the 
creation of nine new Legislative Council [Legco] functional 
constituencies, with a total franchise of 2.7 million people and 
formation of an Election Committee by district board members to 
return 10 legislators. The bill covering the functional 
constituency and election committee polls of the Legislative 
Council will also be gazetted on Friday. 
  China has threatened to call fresh elections for the 
three-tier political structure in 1997 if Mr Patten goes ahead 
with his original constitutional package, which it claims 
violates the Joint Dcclaration, the Basic Law, and previous 
understandings between Britain and China. 
  Although consideration has been given to whether the 
Governor 
should table modified proposals put to the Chinese side last 
summer, Mr Patten is understood to have concluded that even such 
a move would not help win Beijing's support. Instead, Beijing 
would risk defeat as liberal legislators are certain to reject a 
watered-down version. 
  According to the People's Daily article, the two sides had 
come close to an agreement, with a draft memorandum of 
understanding already available on the simple issues relating to 
the district boards and municipal councils polls. The full-page 
article, in the form of an interview between a reporter of the 
paper and a relevant person, detailed the cause leading to the 
collapse of the talks. It also revealed that the two sides 
already reached consensus on how to proceed with the voting age 
and voting method of the district boards and municipal councils 
elections as well as the abolition of appointed seats in the two 
lower tiers of political structure in the 15th round. 
  The relevant person talked extensively on the crux of the 
problems leading to the failure of the talks and he was quoted 
as saying that at one point, China had compromised on the issue 
of the appointment system by agreeing to reduce the number of 
appointed seats of the district boards and the municipal 
councils from one-third to a quarter on the principle of 
proceeding in an orderly fashion. But the British side was 
unwilling to yield an inch, he added. 
  He continued to say that to help win an accord with Britain 
on the district boards and municipal councils elections as 
quickly as possible, the Chinese side had stepped up its efforts 
at the 15th round of talks, offering to attach an explanation to 
the memorandum of understanding spelling out the positions of 
the two sides on the appointment system. 
  The explanation would say that the British side supported 
the 
abolition of the appointment system while the Chinese side 
preferred keeping an appropriate proportion of the appointed 
seats. 
  And after June 30, 1997, the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative 
Region (SAR) Government would decide on the number of district 
boards and appointed seats on its own, based on the stipulation 
of the Basic Law Article 98, he said, adding that the British 
side had agreed to the Chinese side's view on this issue. 
  The two sides also agreed at that time that the 
nongovernment 
nature and functions of the district and municipal bodies would 
remain unchanged in the run-up to 1997. 
  But then the British side started to open new subjects and 
set out new demands at the 16th round of talks in demanding that 
the single-seat, single-vote election method for the Legco polls 
be applied to the Legco elections as well.

<F P=106> [Report: "Qin Wenjun Says Sino-British Talks Are a Matter </F>
Between the Two Governments; Hong Kong Government Has No Right 
To Publish Contents of Talks"] 
  [Text] Qin Wenjun, deputy director of the XINHUA Hong Kong 
Branch, pointed out yesterday: The Sino-British talks on the 
1994- 95 electoral arrangements are a matter between the Chinese 
and British Governments. If the Hong Kong Government wants to 
publish the contents of the talks, this should be conducted 
through diplomatic channels. It should not violate the 
principle of confidentiality agreed upon by the two governments. 
  Qin attended the "Hong Kong United Association for the 
Advancement of Feminism in All Walks of Life" Spring Festival 
get-together yesterday evening. When asked by reporters about 
the British Hong Kong Government's claim that it would publish 
the contents of the 17 rounds of Sino-British talks, he said: 
On this issue the British Hong Kong Government should 
understand three points: First, the Sino-British talks on the 
1994 and 1995 electoral arrangements are a matter between the 
Chinese and British Governments and the Hong Kong Government has 
no right whatsoever to publish the contents of Sino-British 
talks; second, at the beginning of the talks, the Chinese and 
British Governments agreed on a common principle--the principle 
of confidentiality, and the Hong Kong Government should take 
this into consideration prudently; and third, if the Hong Kong 
Government wants to publish the contents of Sino- British talks, 
this should be conducted through diplomatic channels. Qin 
stressed: If the Hong Kong Government unilaterally publishes 
the contents of the talks, it will violate the principle agreed 
upon by the two governments and he asked that the Hong Kong 
Government take a prudent attitude. 
  Regarding the appointment of the third group of Hong Kong 
affairs advisers, Qin said: It is hoped that the list of the 
third group of Hong Kong affairs advisers can be made public in 
March. He said: We hope to expand, as far as possible, the 
channel for soliciting the views of Hong Kong people and unite 
with Hong Kong compatriots to ensure a stable transition for 
Hong Kong.

  [Text] The Chinese government yesterday demanded that 
Britain adhere to the principle of full consultation concerning 
the disclosure of details of the failed talks over Hong Kong's 
electoral arrangements. The deputy director of the New China 
News Agency (Xinhua) in Hong Kong, Qin Wenjun, said Britain must 
go through diplomatic channels with the Chinese government in 
order to release information regarding the issue. 
  Qin, who participated in all 17 rounds of the talks, said 
the 
notification of the Government's intention to release the 
contents of the talks ought to be made in the correct manner. 
"What is called prior notification?" Qin asked. "If we will 
have a meeting tonight and I let you know in the afternoon, that 
is notification. But it is not the right method. 
  "It is not through diplomatic channels. We hope the British 
side will give full consideration to this point." He would not 
say if the Chinese had been informed by the British about its 
proposal to release the details, nor would he say in what way 
China would respond. 
  Qin said firmly that the Hong Kong Government did not have 
the right to publish documents concerning the details of the 
talks, on the grounds that these were conducted between the two 
sovereign powers. "It is a matter between Britain and China. 
It is none of Patten's business," Qin said. He urged Britain 
to remember the two sides had agreed the contents of the talks 
should remain confidential. He said the Chinese government had 
always adhered to this principle. 
  Qin then criticised the Governor, Chris Patten, for inviting 
international support for his political ambitions during his 
trip to Australia. "Does he know what he is doing?" Qin 
questioned. "Perhaps he does not feel content just wandering in 
the streets, stretching his arms to a child or taking a sip of 
some local tea. So he goes out of Hong Kong," Qin said. "What 
he is trying to do is no more than to look for background music 
and to pave the way for his plan to table the remaining parts of 
the bill." 
  Patten has said that China's interpretation of 
"consultation" 
amounted to the British side giving Beijing the right to veto 
his proposals. He said this was unacceptable.

District Affairs Advisers To Be Announced Early Next Month"] 
  [Text] Zhang Xiting, director of the XINHUA Hong Kong 
Branch's office in the New Territories, disclosed that the New 
Territories will account for a certain proportion of the more 
than 200 district affairs advisers to be announced early next 
month. 
  After attending the opening ceremony of the Tsuen Wan Basic 
Law Promotion Carnival, held yesterday, Zhang Xiting was asked 
by reporters about the proportion of district advisers from the 
New Territories and Tsuen Wan in the namelist to be announced 
next month. 
  Zhang Xiting reiterated that the namelist will include 
figures from various strata and circles. The main task of the 
district advisers is to offer advice to the Chinese side on 
district affairs. 
  On the same occasion, Cheng Kai-nam, secretary of the 
Democratic Alliance for Betterment of Hong Kong, told reporters 
that the alliance will discuss at its central standing committee 
meeting tomorrow the question of its members being invited as 
district affairs advisers. 
  Cheng stressed that the duties of the district affairs 
advisers and third group of Hong Kong affairs advisers to be 
appointed next month should not involve administration of the 
current Hong Kong government, but they can offer advice to China 
on post-1997 affairs.

  [Text] The Association of Democracy and People's 
Livelihood announced yesterday that six of its members were 
invited by China to become Hong Kong affairs and district 
affairs advisers. Chairman Fung Kim-kee and Secretary Cheung 
Ka-min are willing to be Hong Kong affairs advisers; and vice 
chairman Leung Kuang-cheong, Liu Shing- lee, and District Board 
member Ou Neng-fa are willing to become district affairs 
advisers. Another member will make a decision after he finishes 
his consulting work in the district. The association must give 
a reply to the Chinese side tomorrow at the latest. 
  According to a XINHUA official, Liu Shing-lee said, the 
responsibilities of the district affairs advisers will include 
offering advice on essential matters related to the transition, 
popularizing the Basic Law, and making proposals on district 
work. 
  Although the Chinese side has invited us to be Hong Kong 
affairs and district affairs advisers in the capacity as 
individuals, Fung Kim-kee said, the association will regard it 
as a political appointment, which must be conditioned and 
supervised by the association because the association has to 
justify itself before the inhabitants.

<F P=106> [By reporter Pan Hui-lien (33821920 5571): "Liu Guinan </F>
(0491 2710 2809), Deputy Director of the Political Department of 
the Guangzhou Military Region, Says Hong Kong People Will Be 
Invited To Watch the Training of Soldiers of the People's 
Liberation Army To Be Garrisoned in Hong Kong"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou -- Liu Guinan, deputy director of the 
Political Department of the Guangzhou Military Region, disclosed 
yesterday that arrangements are to be made for some Hong Kong 
people to watch the training of People's Liberation Army [PLA] 
soldiers in April and May who are to be garrisoned in Hong Kong 
in future. Concrete arrangements will be made by the XINHUA Hong 
Kong Branch in a unified manner. 
  Liu Guinan, head of a 33-member delegation of the PLA 
deputies to the Guangdong Provincial People's Congress, is 
attending the Second Session of the Eighth Guangdong Provincial 
People's Congress in Guangzhou. He refused to disclose whether 
the Hong Kong personalities will go to Guangzhou or Shenzhen to 
watch the training; however, he said that the military, being 
aware of Hong Kong residents' concern over PLA soldiers to be 
garrisoned in Hong Kong, has planned to arrange for some Hong 
Kong personalities to watch the training of the PLA soldiers in 
April and May. As to whether or not those who will watch the 
training are members of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) 
or people's deputies, and whether or not journalists will be 
allowed to accompany the personalities, will be studied and 
dealt with by the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch. 
  When the PWC was established in Beijing in July of last 
year, 
some of its members suggested that the military should make 
arrangements for some PWC members to watch the training of the 
PLA soldiers to be garrisoned in Hong Kong in order to improve 
the impression of the PLA on Hong Kong people and to reduce the 
latter's worries. After that, Rita Fan Hsu Lai-tai, head of the 
Hong Kong side of the PWC Social and Security Subcommittee, also 
formally put forward such a request to Xu Huizi, deputy chief of 
General Staff of the PLA and a member of the subcommittee, at a 
subcommittee meeting at the end of September last year, but no 
arrangement was made by the military. 
  Tsui Sze-men, member of the Standing Committee of the 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference and PWC member, disclosed earlier that 
it was learned that the military planned to make arrangements 
for PWC members to go to Shenzhen in October of last year to 
watch the training of PLA soldiers to be garrisoned in Hong 
Kong, but because the Sino-British talks on constitutional 
affairs entered a crucial moment at that time and the political 
atmosphere was quite tense, the Chinese side put the plan aside. 
  According to another report, an official of the Guangdong 
Provincial Propaganda Department disclosed yesterday that on the 
morning of 1 March, a ceremony will be held at the Shenzhen 
Reservoir to celebrate the completion of the third-phase 
expansion of the project for water supplied by Dong Jiang and to 
mark the 29th anniversary of supplying water to Hong Kong. The 
official, however, refused to confirm whether or not Premier Li 
Peng will attend the ceremony.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by Chen Xin: "Keep Hong Kong Stable -- Patten </F>
Told"] 
  [Text] Canberra, February 19 (XINHUA) -- Hong Kong 
Governor Chris Patten seems to like doing something under the 
pretence of another thing, he did it again during his trip to 
Australia which ends today. 
  When the governor started the visit here a week ago, he 
claimed that his purpose was to promote the economic and trade 
ties between Hong Kong and Australia. 
  It sounded good, but Patten soon forgot it. In most of his 
speeches here, he talked in a big way about his proposals on 
Hong Kong's political system. 
  it's not a surprise. When he unilaterally introduced part of 
his proposals to the Legislative Council last December, he 
undermined the ongoing Sino-British negotiations on the issue. 
Yet, he, regardless of the fact, blamed China for being 
responsible for it . 
  He said that he came to Australia to seek "understanding and 
support" and that his proposals were to ensure Hong Kong's 
democracy and future. 
  However, people here in the Australian society have their 
own 
judgement about Patten's so-called proposals. While some may 
regard it as "admirable," many others took it the other way. 
  Australian former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser in a column 
article before Patten's visit said what Hong Kong needs during 
the transitional period is stability, but Patten's proposals 
will only bring about chaos there. 
  Anyone who's familiar with the British colonial history 
knows 
that the british Government had never shown any interest in 
democracy in Hong Kong over the past 150 years. So why does 
Patten raise the issue when the territory is to return to China? 
the article said. 
  It said that it's clear that Patten simply wants to maintain 
the prestige of the colonial empire of Great Britain even after 
1997. To achieve that, he used the word "democracy" as his 
pretence. 
  David Lague, "THE AUSTRALIAN" newspaper's Hong Kong 
correspondent, said while Patten upholds his proposals of 
"democratization," he "has made little effort to end the 
arrogant and undemocratic style of his administration". 
  "More fundamentally, he has failed to take the Hong Kong 
people into his confidence," Lague said. 
  During talks with Patten this week, Australian Prime 
Minister 
Paul Keating, who once said his government was not impressed by 
Patten's proposals, stressed again that the "continuing 
prosperity and stability" in Hong Kong is important to his 
country.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Chris Patten's Wicked Motives Viewed From His </F>
Remarks in Australia"] 
  [Text] During his recent visit to Australia, Chris Patten 
on several occasions made remarks in public that obviously 
violated the Sino-British Joint Declaration. 
  During his stay in Australia, Chris Patten repeatedly 
advocated that Hong Kong was an "international asset," and such 
a concept gravely violates the most fundamental principle laid 
down in the Joint Declaration. The most basic principle in the 
Joint Declaration is that the recovery of Hong Kong is the 
common aspiration of the entire Chinese people, the Chinese 
Government has decided to resume the exercise of sovereignty 
over Hong Kong effective 1 July 1997, and the Government of the 
United Kingdom declares that it will restore Hong Kong to the 
PRC effective 1 July 1997. This basic principle in the Joint 
Declaration shows that Hong Kong is an inseparable part of 
China's sacred territory, and by no means is it an 
"international asset." Chris Patten said that the Chinese 
side's criticism of his visit to Australia shows it is "playing 
the international card" and "has a lack of understanding of Hong 
Kong's role and importance in the world." According to Chris 
Patten's logic, all cities that have an important role in the 
world are inevitably "international assets." However, no one 
would fail to see the important role of such cities as London 
and New York in the world, can we say that those cities are 
"international assets" too? Does it follow that all countries 
may possess them and share their assets? Obviously, Britain 
would not agree with that point, nor would the United States 
tolerate it. Chris Patten's wicked motive lies in instigating 
all countries to intervene in Hong Kong's affairs, thus impeding 
China's resumption of its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong 
by relying on international political forces. 
  During his stay in Australia, Chris Patten also said: 
"Britain has a moral obligation to Hong Kong after 1997," "the 
idea that the Joint Declaration means to say that Britain will 
no longer have moral obligations and interests in Hong Kong is 
entirely contradictory." This is a distortion and vilification 
of the Joint Declaration, which stipulates that British rule in 
Hong Kong will terminate in 1997: where do British "moral 
obligations" come in after 1997? Chris Patten's big lie can 
fool no one. One has only to read the article, entitled, "Our 
Basic Position on the Issue of Hong Kong," and its annotations 
in volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, 
to have a clear picture that, in the course of the Sino-British 
talks on the future of Hong Kong, the British side repeatedly 
insisted on its position of prolonging its right to rule over 
Hong Kong and maintaining British influence over Hong Kong after 
1997. Nevertheless, the British side's stubborn position 
deservedly met with the Chinese side's firm opposition. It was 
under such circumstances that the British side had to sign the 
Joint Declaration. On this point, Mrs. Thatcher recorded 
clearly in her memoirs, "The Downing Street Years," in which she 
said that on 14 October 1983, she sent a letter to the Chinese 
side: "At this point, I have to make the decision that we shall 
return sovereignty to China as well as the right to rule," "this 
shows that we do not expect that power links between Britain and 
Hong Kong will continue to exist after 1997, and Britain will no 
longer have any obligations toward Hong Kong." Related 
annotations in the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping 
also indicate that in the wake of the British Prime Minister's 
letter of October 1983, "the British side has ascertained that 
it would no longer insist on British rule nor would it plan for 
any form of condominium, and has the understanding that China's 
plan is founded on the prerequisite that sovereignty and right 
of rule of Hong Kong in their entirety should be returned to 
China after 1997. Thus, the removal of the main hurdle to 
Sino-British talks began." Therefore, we can see that Chris 
Patten's remarks that "the idea that the Joint Declaration means 
to say Britain has no moral obligations and interests in Hong 
Kong after 1997 is entirely contradictory" runs counter to the 
true meaning of the Joint Declaration as well as historical 
facts. 
  During his stay in Australia, Chris Patten also threatened: 
"If we think the Chinese are violating the solemn commitments 
they have made in the Joint Declaration, we are sure to raise 
this question in the international community...I am sure Britain 
will inevitably make some choices." The truth is that the 
British side has violated the Joint Declaration and its 
commitment to converge with the Basic Law and the Sino-British 
diplomatic understanding and accords, but Chris Patten went to 
the Australia and made false countercharges against the Chinese 
side in an attempt to confuse public opinion and shift the 
responsibility to the Chinese side; at the same time, he 
presented the British "choices" characterized by the "three 
violations" to the international community to dupe people the 
world over and fool them into giving their support. However, 
all this is in vain. During his stay in Australia, Chris Patten 
made many remarks which obviously violate the Joint Declaration; 
in actual fact, he has only revealed the evil plots of the 
British side in its attempts to thoroughly break faith with the 
Joint Declaration. It would be helpful to the international 
community and public opinion to have a clear picture of the 
truth, and see through his hypocrisy. This being the case, the 
"international card" Chris Patten played during his visit to 
Australia can only help the British side in the opposite 
direction. 
  As the Hong Kong governor who must be responsible for 
maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and realizing a 
stable transition in the last few years of the transition period 
according to the stipulations of the Joint Declaration, should 
Chris Patten have gone to another country to distort and trample 
on the Joint Declaration, should he have stirred up trouble; 
this shows that Chris Patten has not the slightest intention to 
maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and to insure the 
smooth transfer of government according to the stipulations of 
the Joint Declaration. Whereas the British Government has given 
a free hand to Chris Patten to talk a lot of nonsense in the 
international community and spread remarks that obviously 
violate the Joint Declaration. This also exposed the British 
Government in its attempts to openly express its position of 
refusing to implement the Joint Declaration to the international 
community. Such a practice is rare in the history of 
international relations and is amazing. Regarding this, we must 
show grave concern. However, China's position of resolutely 
safeguarding its sovereignty and implementing the Joint 
Declaration will not move a bit. The British Government should 
rein in from the brink of the precipice and should take 
responsibility to publicly clarify Chris Patten's absurd remarks.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Deng Xiaoping Left Shanghai on 19 </F>
February"] 
  [Text] Shanghai, 19 Feb (WEN WEI PO)--Deng Xiaoping this 
morning boarded a special train leaving Shanghai. 
  The municipality's major party and government officials, Wu 
Bangguo and Huang Ju, saw Deng off at the railway station. 
  A source said Deng Xiaoping's special train was heading 
northward for Beijing, but he did not rule out the possibility 
that the train might go to other cities. 
  The schedules of all trains arriving and leaving the 
Shanghai 
station this morning were changed unexpectedly. Passengers were 
given the explanation that the change was due to the departure 
of a special train from Minhang, Shanghai, carrying a Long March 
rocket to the Xichang satellite launching base. 
  Deng Xiaoping has spent the Spring Festival in Shanghai in 
the past few years since 1988. He showed up in public on the 
Spring Festival this year, which has caused various speculations 
on his health. According to those who were present at the 
railway station seeing Deng Xiaoping off, he looked in pretty 
good shape [jing shen bu cuo 4737 4377 0008 6934] today. And 
Deng Xiaoping's being able to travel by train may be in itself a 
reply to people's speculations. 
  Chen Yun, who also passed the Spring Festival and made a 
public appearance in Shanghai as Deng did, is still in Shanghai.

  [Text] Deng Xiaoping's doctors have advised the Chinese 
patriarch not to travel in the near future because of his 
declining health. Chinese sources in Beijing said yesterday the 
power struggle among the Communist Party's factions had 
intensified in anticipation of the absence of Mr Deng with a 
campaign of innuendo against the senior leader's relatives and 
his personal office. 
  The sources said Mr Deng, who left Shanghai for Beijing on 
Saturday, was asked by his large team of medical specialists to 
"take a good rest". They said even assuming that his health 
picked up soon, it was unlikely the 89-year-old leader would 
leave the capital again before spring. Sources in Guangdong 
said the local leadership had not lost hope that the "patron of 
the south" might still call on them. 
  Diplomats in Beijing said factions hostile to the patriarch, 
including Maoists and ultra-liberal intellectuals, had started a 
"campaign of innuendo" against Mr Deng's relatives and personal 
office. "A widely circulated report in Beijing claims that some 
of the patriarch's relatives are using Mr Deng's influence to 
help their business interests--and that these relatives know 
they must make the best use of the relatively short time that is 
left," a diplomat said. "For example, a few of the facilities 
that Mr Deng inspected recently are said to be related to these 
business interests." 
  Another target of what has already been described as an 
embryonic anti-Deng campaign is criticism of the "imperial 
manners" of the patriarch's powerful personal office. In 
theory, outside the party and government establishment the 
office has tremendous clout because it controls the patriarch's 
communications with the outside world. Criticism of the office 
ranges from preventing certain types of in formation from 
reaching Mr Deng to run-ins with local police and other 
authorities over the kind of protection that should be accorded 
the senior leader on the road. 
  Sources in Shanghai said Mr Deng's security guards had a 
brief confrontation with a group of bus drivers last month, 
partly caused by the "overzealousness" of his personal office.

  [Text] Beijing, 20 Feb (XINHUA) -- Recently, the Central 
Literature Publishing House and the Social Sciences Literature 
Publishing House, respectively, published Deng Xiaoping 
Thought on and the Practice of Building Special Economic Zones 
[SEZ] [deng xiao ping te qu jian she si xiang yu shi jian 
-- 6772 1420 1627 3676 0575 1696 6080 1835 1927 5280 1395 6432]

  Deng Xiaoping Thought on and the Practice of Building 
Special Economic Zones is a collection of materials. The 
book collects Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important propositions 
since 1978 on opening up to the outside world and on building 
SEZ's; propositions on building SEZ's in important party and 
government documents; and economic policies and statutes on 
developing SEZ's promulgated by the National People's Congress, 
the State Council, the governments of coastal provinces and 
cities, and the governments of SEZ's. The book also illustrates 
the profound changes and tremendous achievements of Shenzhen, 
Zhuhai, Shantou, Xiamen, and Hainan since they were built into 
SEZ's. 
  A Study of Deng Xiaoping Thought on Building Special 
Economic Zones is a collection of treatises. It contains 
the latest research findings by workers in theoretical circles, 
as well as those engaged in practical work, over the past two 
years regarding Deng Xiaoping thought on building SEZ's. 
Specifically, the papers compiled by leading cadres, 
specialists, and academics who spent many years assisting in the 
construction of SEZ's illustrate the profound content and 
theoretical significance of Deng Xiaoping thought on building 
SEZ's, expound the great practical effects of the thought, sum 
up the tremendous achievements and valuable experiences in 
building SEZ's over the past 14 years, and outline problems 
arising from the development of SEZ's during the nineties and 
the measures for solving these, all from the perspectives of 
different disciplines -- philosophy, economics, politics, and 
sociology -- and by integrating the past and the present, as 
well as theory and practice.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by staff reporter Fang Yuen (2455 0337): </F>
"Li Peng Report at Upcoming National People's Congress To Take 
Reform, Stability As the Main Theme"] 
  [Text] According to a source in Beijing, the 20-character 
principle of "seizing the opportunity, promoting development, 
and deepening reform, opening up wider, and maintaining 
stability" will be the main theme of the Eighth National 
People's Congress [NPC], which opens on 10 March. Li Peng's 
Government Work Report will be focused on the relationship 
between reform, development, and stability. 
  It has been reported that the "Securities Law (Draft)," 
which 
was set to be one of the main points on the agenda of the 
current congress, will not be submitted to the congress for 
deliberation. Instead, the "Budget Law" and "Law for Protecting 
Taiwan Investment" will be submitted to the congress for 
deliberation and approval. 
  Premier Li Peng's Government Work Report (Solicitation of 
Opinions), drafted by the State Council's writing group, has 
been distributed to the ministries, committees, and provincial 
groups. 
  It is said that this year's government report will comprise 
around 17,000 characters, more or less the same as last year. 
It will consist of seven parts: 
  First, a review and summary of last year's work. 
  Second, the tasks laid down for this year's economic 
development. 
  Third, reform. 
  Fourth, strengthening macroeconomic control and regulation 
and checking inflation. 
  Fifth, spiritual civilization, education, and social order. 
  Sixth, Taiwan and Hong Kong. 
  Seventh, the international situation and diplomatic work. 
  Reportedly, the 20-character principle will run through Li 
Peng's Government Work Report. Li Peng will also talk at length 
about the relationship between reform, development, and 
stability. An authoritative person said that the original theme 
of "reform" may eventually be changed to "stability." 
  Many local officials have complained about the setbacks 
encountered in implementing a series of reform measures 
introduced this year. It is estimated that many of the CPC 
Central Committee's policies will be censured at this year's 
congress. For this reason, the central authorities made 
preparations long ago. On the one hand, senior officials were 
sent to all localities before the Lunar New Year to do 
persuasive work. On the other hand, the media's reportage of 
the congress will be kept under strict control and "stability" 
will be the top priority. 
  The dates for this year's NPC and Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC] have been brought forward. It 
is said that the authorities intend to bring the dates of the 
two annual sessions forward, to be held annually after the Lunar 
New Year to make plans for the new year. The authorities hold 
that post-Lunar New Year is the appropriate time for holding the 
sessions. If the dates are brought forward it will be difficult 
to draft the Government Work Report and prepare the statistics. 
  Accommodation for NPC delegates is more or less the same as 
in previous years. The only difference is that more delegates 
will stay in official and Army guest houses rather than the 
Xiyuan Hotel and other starred hotels as in the past. Beijing 
Hotel will "exclusively" receive the Guangdong delegation this 
year. The Shanghai delegation, the most conspicuous one, will 
stay in the Army's heavily guarded Jingxi Guesthouse.

  [Excerpt] Guangzhou has called in the People's Liberation 
Army to manage a deluge of out-of-province rural job-seekers 
that is expected to reach a peak in the next few days. 
  The head of the city's New Year Transport Committee, Ma 
Yijun, said soldiers were being used at train stations and along 
railway lines to "assist" public security officers, armed police 
and railway police in maintaining order. "We've got hundreds of 
plainclothes and uniformed soldiers out there every day," Ma 
said. "Nobody would dare step out of line." 
  The number of soldiers has been increased since last 
Tuesday's tragedy at Heng-yang in Hunan province where 51 job 
seekers were trampled to death after two trains arrived at the 
station at the same time. Ma said the Hengyang incident was "a 
small thing", but admitted a national circular had been issued 
since then to tighten management at train station. [passage

That They Have No Way Out Other Than Reform"] 
  [Text] Zhuhai, 13 Feb (WEN WEI PO) -- On the afternoon of 
the third day of the Spring Festival, several unusual guests 
visited the families of Luo Taoan and Lin Gen, ordinary peasants 
of the village of Guangsheng, in Nanping, Zhuhai. Accompanied 
by Ling Botang, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the 
Guangdong Provincial People's Congress and Liang Guangda and 
other Zhuhai leaders, Tian Jiyun, member of the Political Bureau 
of the CPC Central Committee and vice chairman of the NPC 
Standing Committee, visited the families of these two peasants 
and had cordial discussions with them. 
  It was raining that afternoon. NPC Vice Chairman Tian Jiyun 
first came to Luo Taoan's house. After listening to an 
introduction, he said: Over the past few years, whenever I have 
come to the coastal regions, I have had to go and have a look at 
the rural areas. I am very delighted in my heart to see that 
the peasants are leading a better and better life every day. 
This shows that the path of reform and opening up designed by 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping is completely correct. It is impossible 
to have a prosperous and strong country without developing the 
economy. Facts show that reform and opening up must not be 
shaken. There is no way out other than reform. After this, NPC 
Vice Chairman Tian Jiyun visited the family of Lin Gen, who is a 
fruit grower by occupation.

  [Text] Beijing, February 21 (XINHUA) -- The year 1993 
witnessed redoubled efforts by the country's legislature, the 
National People's Congress (NPC), in making laws to facilitate 
the establishment of a socialist market economy. 
  The NPC Standing Committee passed 20 laws and 13 provisional 
regulations, and deliberated eight other draft laws, last year 
-- all record figures in its history. 
  A package of economic laws to regulate market forces, 
maintain market order and strengthen macro-economic control were 
promulgated to safeguard, enhance and guide the healthy 
development of the socialist market economy. 
  The Corporate Law, published last December 20, was the first 
law regulating the activities of the numerous existing companies 
in the country. 
  It is seen to have great importance in promoting a "modern 
enterprise system" in line with international practices. 
  The NPC Standing Committee also passed the Law Against 
Unethical Competition, the Consumers' Rights Law, the Law of 
Registered Accountants, the Amendment to Laws Against Producing 
and Selling Fake and Shoddy Goods, and the provisional 
regulations on value-added tax, consumption tax and business tax 
for overseas enterprises. 
  Both inside and outside China, these moves aroused 
widespread 
interest. 
  Economic experts said these laws and regulations will 
effectively curb unfair competition, cut down crimes in 
producing and selling fake and shoddy goods, and protect the 
legal rights of all those involved. 
  The legislature also revised the Economic Contract Law, the 
Individual Income Tax Law and the Accountants Law to cater to 
the demands of the market economy. 
  The Budget Law is aimed to improve the country's financial 
system and strengthen macro-economic control. It was 
deliberated by the NPC Standing Committee last year and will be 
submitted to the Eighth NPC's Second Plenary Session to be held 
from March 10 in Beijing. 
  The lawmakers also passed the Agriculture Law, the Law of 
Science and Technology Development, the Education Law and the 
Red Cross Law in 1993. 
  They deliberated the draft securities law, the draft foreign 
trade law, the draft law to protect investments by Taiwanese, 
the draft state reimbursement law, the draft law on state medals 
and state honors. 
  All the laws and the draft laws are based on China's 
realities and commensurate with norms of international conduct. 
The legislative experiences of other market economies were 
"boldly" imbibed and learned from, experts said.

<F P=106> ["Commentary" by XINHUA reporters Hui Jinyi (1920 6855 5030) </F>
and Li Renhu (2621 0088 5706): "Strong Party Branches Are Needed 
in Rural Areas"] 
  [Text] Taiyuan, 21 Feb (XINHUA) -- Under the new 
circumstances of developing a socialist market economy, to 
continuously strengthen the construction of village-level 
organizations, while focusing on party branches, is an important 
and pressing task facing the party's work in rural areas, as 
well as a major political and organizational guarantee for 
reform, economic growth, and social progress in rural areas. 
During an inspection of Shanxi prior to the Spring Festival, 
General Secretary Jiang Zemin explicitly pointed out: "The core 
issue of rural work at the grass-roots level lies in building up 
party branches." 
  As reform and development enter a new stage in rural areas, 
the party and government are guiding and helping hundreds of 
millions of peasants to gear their production to markets and to 
become prosperous all together. To accomplish this glorious and 
yet arduous task, we need tens of thousands of grass-roots rural 
party organizations possessing both cohesive power and a 
fighting capability, such as the organization in Qiaolicun 
village. 
  The Qiaolicun general party branch's cohesive power and 
fighting capability are referred to, to put it in the villagers' 
own words, as their political sensitivity, correct ideology, 
democratic style, and economic honesty. 
  Political sensitivity means the party branch's adeptness in 
promptly combining the party's general political principles with 
local realities and creatively implementing the central 
authorities' guidelines as concrete work. 
  Correct ideology means that party branch members always have 
always borne in mind the goal of serving the people 
wholeheartedly, constantly caring for the masses, doing 
everything for them, placing their interests above anything 
else, and willingly sacrificing individual interests when there 
is a conflict between individual and collective interests. 
  Democratic style refers to criticism and self-criticism 
conducted periodically within the party branch, especially its 
adherence to the line of from the masses to the masses and its 
reliance on the masses in doing everything and in making 
economic construction and the work in other fields of endeavor 
the conscious actions of the masses. 
  Economic honesty means that party branch members have 
inherited and carried forward the fine tradition of being the 
first to bear hardships and the last to enjoy comforts, have 
upheld the communist outlook on life and value concepts, and 
have conscientiously resisted selfishness and money worshipping. 
  Practice has shown that improved grass-roots organizations 
in 
rural areas are crucial to implementing the party's principles 
and policies, promoting reform and development, and ensuring 
social stability in rural areas. Therefore, all localities 
should coordinate efforts to continue to improve village-level 
organizations, in focusing on party branches. Through improving 
their ideology, style, and organization, all village-level 
organizations should meet the following requirements: Party 
branches should be able to play their role as the core of the 
leadership and fighting bastion in a true sense; villagers 
committees should be able to exercise their self-governing power 
in handling each village's affairs; collective economic 
organizations should attain a certain level of economic strength 
for bringing into play their function of serving farm 
households; and other village-level organizations should 
effectively do their duties and carry out their work. By so 
doing, the economic and social outlooks in rural areas will 
undergo even greater changes. Qiaolicun village has already 
provided us with its successful experience.

<F P=106> [By Jia Chunfeng (6328 2504 1496): "Market Economy and </F>
Cultural Development"] 
  [Text] With the approach of the 21st century, culture has 
become an increasing concern and a hot topic in domestic and 
international academic circles, indicating a strong interest in 
the trend of development in contemporary culture. This 
situation did not arise without cause. 
  Internationally speaking, as people are crossing into the 
next century, they cannot help looking back at the roads they 
have traversed in this century and ahead at the next one. This 
prompts them to reflect on the problem of culture, particularly 
when the extension and deepening of the market economy has given 
rise to many new trends of development. Comparative studies of 
several market economic models invariably point to the 
increasing importance of cultural backgrounds and value 
concepts. Some people have gone even further by claiming that 
the economic race on the international market and the tug of war 
between the several market economic models in the next century 
will very much be a contest of "cultural strength." 
  Domestically speaking, reform and opening up and the 
development of the socialist market economic system have 
provided an opportunity for cultural undertakings to achieve a 
new level of prosperity and has injected enormous vitality into 
them. On the other hand, achieving a new level of prosperity 
for Chinese socialist culture under a market economy calls for 
enormous effort, sophisticated planning, and a range of 
practical and creative work. Even judging from what has 
happened so far, the impact on the existing cultural pattern, 
cultural management system, and traditional cultural concepts 
has been nothing short of unprecedented. In the realm of social 
culture, whole spectrums of thought and great varieties of 
schools are competing for attention, forever and constantly 
confronting people with new situations, problems, and 
contradictions and demanding that we approach and reflect on the 
great subject of cultural development from a new angle, in the 
context of the changing objective reality, and under the 
guidance of the theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
<H3>  Beginning with International Market Competition and Combined 
National Strength </H3>
  Studies and works on the relationship between the economy 
and 
culture around the world have put forward a valuable concept, 
"cultural power," in analyzing "cultural market mechanisms" and 
"economic and cultural values." As the intelligence 
factor in economic and social development, "cultural power," 
which embraces science and education, is becoming increasingly 
important both in status and its role in economic development 
and modernization and has attracted serious attention. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: Take China for instance. 
In the 1950's its technological gap with Japan was not that 
wide. But in the following 20 years we closed ourselves to the 
outside world, competition on the international markets being 
the least on our agenda, while in the same period Japan became 
an economic power. In the long term, the focus is on education, 
science, and technology. We have wasted 20 years and our 
development is 20 years behind. I could not imagine what the 
consequences would be if we wasted another 20 years. 
  The concept of "cultural power" was raised during the 20 
years when Japan became an economic power. Since, with great 
foresight, Comrade Deng Xiaoping approached the problems of 
developing education, science, and technology against the 
background of international market competition, his exposition 
carries profound strategic significance. Current international 
competition is ultimately a contest of combined national 
strength, which is founded on economic and technological power 
as well as on spiritual civilization, including "cultural 
power." Spiritual civilization and "cultural power," as two of 
the elements making up combined national strength, have 
enormously cohesive, mobilizing, encouraging, and promotive 
power. Therefore, to heighten combined national strength, it is 
necessary not only to develop economic and scientific and 
technological power, but also to tap into our spiritual 
civilization and develop "cultural power." Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping has made profound an exposition on this: "The 
strength of our nation and the reserve strength for economic 
development depend increasingly on the quality of our labor 
force and the quantity and quality of our intellectuals. The 
human resources of a country of 1 billion population will be so 
enormous that no country can be a match if it can get its 
education on track. With the advantage of human resources and 
an advanced socialist system, we can be confident of attaining 
our goals." Comrade Deng Xiaoping also said: "The children in 
primary one classes today will become members of the main 
pioneering force in the 21st century after undergoing decades of 
education. The central authorities must make tremendous efforts 
to grasp education, beginning such efforts with the primary and 
secondary school levels. This is a move of great strategic 
insight. We will ruin the whole enterprise and stand guilty in 
front of history if we do not propose such a mission to the 
whole party." (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, pp 120-121) These sayings show a deep historical 
insight into contemporary international economic competition and 
China's way toward development. Only when we approach "cultural 
power" from the perspective of increasing combined national 
strength, attaining the goal of development, and launching 21st 
century enterprises can we appreciate the extreme importance of 
developing "cultural power." 
<H3>  The Inner Requirements of the Development of a Modern Market 
Economy </H3>
  Developing "cultural power," with emphasis on the important 
status and role of education, science, and technology is the 
fundamental trend and requirement of a modern market economy. 
  One of the fundamental trends in the development of a 
modern market economy is the growing "integration" of the 
economy and culture. From the 1970's onward, modern 
commodities have carried an increasingly higher proportion of 
cultural input and value, and science and technology and culture 
have figured ever more prominently in economic development. For 
modern enterprises to keep developing and stay competitive, and 
also for the whole society to sustain economic growth, the goals 
to achieve in modern commodity production are to reduce visible 
resource, energy, and financial input, that is "tangible 
inputs," and raise invisible -- that is "intangible" -- inputs 
such as science and technology and culture. The conclusion to be 
drawn from this trend of development is that we must pay great 
attention to the development of the intelligence factor, talent 
training, and education, and to growth of science and technology 
and "cultural power." The second fundamental trend in 
the development of the modern market economy is the replacement 
of traditional elements by intelligence in economic 
development. Rolls Theroux, a contemporary American 
economist, says: The green revolution and revolutions in 
material science have lowered the importance of natural 
resources in economic development. Possessing natural resources 
is no more a guarantee for wealth than the lack of them is an 
obstacle to getting rich. Revolutions in telecommunications, 
computers, transportation, and logistics and backup system have 
formed for us a global resource network, from which may evolve a 
global capital market. In other words, computers and 
telecommunications have ended the domination obtained through 
capital accumulation. Genuine advantage in the future lies in 
talent and acquisition of technology. Microelectronics, 
biotechnology, new material industries, civil aviation, 
telecommunications, robotic machine tools, and computers and 
computer software are the seven key industries for coming 
decades. All of them can be described as brain industries which 
can be located anywhere on the globe. One can pick anywhere to 
develop these industries as long as enough intelligence 
resources can be marshalled there. Since science and technology 
now lend a relative advantage to human resources, the race to 
benefit from this development demands that enterprises equip 
their management staff and workers with skills. The key weapon 
with which to compete in the 21st century will be workers' 
skill. The analysis of the trend of development in the market 
economy leads to the same conclusion: We must set great store by 
the development of the intelligence factor, talent training, and 
education, and by the growth of science and technology and 
"cultural power." 
  The third fundamental trend of development in the 
modern market economy is that modern production flows demand 
workers of an increasingly higher quality. International 
market economic studies and economists are paying great 
attention to this fact: All three major new products on mass 
consumer markets -- videocameras and recorders, facsimiles, and 
laser-disc players -- were invented by Americans and Europeans 
(the Dutch). In terms of sales volumes, employments, and 
profits, however, all three have become Japanese products. This 
prominent fact shows that whoever can reduce product costs takes 
the prize away from the hands of the inventor and dominates the 
market. In today's market competition, if the inventor of a new 
product is not at the same time its manufacturer at the lowest 
cost, he can hardly expect to benefit from his own invention. 
And to become a lowest cost-manufacturer, the average quality 
of workers is of great importance, and to raise their quality, 
requires education and on-the-job training. The conclusion 
drawn from this trend of development again is: We must set 
great store by educational development and the growth of science 
and technology and "cultural power." 
<H3>  The General Cultural Development Strategy Must Match the 
Specific Modes in Which Various Cultural Undertakings Proceed </H3>
  The problem of cultural development strategy was postulated 
in answer to the call for development of the socialist market 
economic system. Cultural development is a key integral 
part of the entire socialist spiritual civilization. In the 
pursuit of spiritual civilization, cultural and ideological 
undertakings and wisdom and morality permeate each other. Under 
development of a market economy, ideological undertakings 
include moral education and an education in discipline and 
ideals. Instead of allowing them to be weakened, these have to 
be strengthened and expanded into new dimensions in order to 
ensure that the spiritual and moral state of the Chinese race 
improves along with extension of the market economy. 
Similarly, cultural undertakings must also lend an ear to the 
call of practice, base themselves on the basic requirement of 
developing a socialist market economic system, open up new 
paths, and achieve new levels of prosperity. All these require 
us to study cultural development strategies seriously. A few 
years ago, some localities held seminars on cultural development 
strategy. We may get some useful hints from them. The study of 
cultural development strategies today is based on this reality: 
One, the development of a market economy; two, fierce 
international competition, in both concrete competition for 
market shares and the contest of "cultural power" around the end 
of this century and in the 21st century. A book on the history 
of world civilizations overseas names four factors in explaining 
why the Renaissance happened in Italy: "Italian cities were the 
chief beneficiaries of the resurgence of trade with the Orient. 
For many years, Venice, Naples, Genoa, and Pisa actually 
controlled the Mediterranean trade. Merchants in Florence, 
Palermo, Piacenza, and cities in the Lombardy Plain were the 
main intermediaries of trade between southern and northern 
Europe. Economic prosperity resulting from commerce was the 
main foundation for intellectual and artistic progress." This 
argument is well-founded. The book also says: "The Renaissance 
and Reformation inevitably occurred simultaneously with 
fundamental economic changes. Without radical changes in the 
medieval economy, there would not have been such enormous 
changes in thought and religion." The mercantile revolution 
marked the transition from the "semi-stagnant, localized, 
non-profitmaking Middle Ages" to the capitalist economy. What 
we are pursuing today -- the development of a market economy -- 
is an extensive, dynamic, and creative practice in our country's 
vast area. Our cultural study must be founded on this practice, 
guided by Marxist historical materialism, and directed toward 
fashioning a strategy for cultural development. The general 
cultural development strategy must match and be united with the 
specific modes and practices of various cultural undertakings. 
Here the specific mode and practices of cultural undertakings 
in various sectors refer to corporate, community, township and 
town, and campus cultures. Cultural undertakings in a certain 
sector appeal more strongly to the hearts and minds of people 
holding positions and working in that sector. Only individual 
and separate studies of these cultures in these different 
sectors and energetically putting them into practice can give a 
general cultural development strategy realistic expression and 
render the entire cultural enterprise solid and rigorous. We 
should see that as the market economy develops, cultural 
undertakings in these different sectors are becoming 
increasingly important and new trends of development are 
emerging. Take corporate culture as an instance. More and more 
entrepreneurs are coming to be aware of the increasingly bigger 
role of cultural factors in company and market expansion, and 
are beginning to approach corporate culture with a new 
perspective. In our country, a few books on corporate culture 
were published a few years ago. But on the whole, they were 
written under the planned economic system and have their limits. 
Corporate culture is appearing in some enterprises, though with 
emphasis more on sports and entertainment, and obviously not 
effective enough to tap whatever inner factors there are to 
generate a drive toward the market within the enterprises. 
Areas calling for improvement in the pursuit of corporate 
culture are being taken seriously by entrepreneurs. We can say 
that as the objective of developing a socialist market economic 
system gets defined, the corporate culture and its studies are 
also coming to a new starting point. 
<H5>  An Important Trend in Current Cultural Development </H5>
  There is a trend for modern market economic culture to graft 
onto and unify with the traditional culture in current cultural 
development in China. This is a new topic worth studying. The 
study of Qi culture by Zibo City, Shandong, in the context of 
its push for a market economy, illustrates it well. The city 
experienced rapid economic growth recently. And it was the 
rapid development of the township and town market economy that 
prompted Zibo people to appreciate anew and study again the 
value of Qi culture. They have just shot a five-episode 
television documentary series, "Today as Embraced by History," 
probing the relationship between Qi and today's culture. The 
fifth episode, entitled "Simple Truth," quotes from Guan Zi: 
"Enrich the people first -- therein lies the way of ruling a 
nation; for government becomes as easy when the people are rich 
as it is hard when they are poor." "Rites will be observed when 
people's granaries are full and dignity comes with adequate food 
and clothes." The special stresses the mercantile tradition of 
Qi culture, showing that Qi people wanted nothing more than 
"trading and the accumulation of wealth" and all agreed that the 
"absence of trade will impoverish the people." Most 
interestingly, Qi people valued production as well as 
management. Once the king of Qi asked his councillor: "Why are 
the bows made in government workshops so poor in quality, their 
arrows never travel far?" The councillor answered: "Because, 
your majesty, the pay and condition for government craft masters 
stays the same whether or not he is doing a good job. They do 
not think of improving their work. The quality naturally never 
improves. On the other hand, most of the nongovernment craft 
masters are hunters, their livelihood depends on solid bows and 
sharp arrows. They are the ones who hunt animals with their 
tools and of course they will not fool themselves -- hence the 
good quality." The television series narrative chimed in: A 
joke here: Does this not sound like a criticism of the 
government-run enterprises with their "eating from the same pot" 
system? People converged on the Qi to do business "like water 
running its natural course." What was attracting these 
businessmen? "Bold reforms, good service, and profitability," 
says the special, "Come and take a look at the Qi's preferential 
policies and better commercial services. Put down tariff 
barriers, refrain from setting up regional barriers, lower duty 
rates; `charging one percent for every 50 units,' which comes to 
a two percent tax rate today; moreover there were no other taxes 
once the tariff was paid. The Qi provided free meals for 
businessmen arriving in a four horse-drawn carriage; free meals 
and fodder for those arriving with four; and five waiters, apart 
from all the rest, to those with five. To develop commerce, the 
Qi set up a depot every 30 li as rest points for foreign 
merchants. The Qi saw perfecting the market and market 
management as important means for developing commerce, and 
honesty and fair trade as the fundamental way to develop 
markets. Anyone who tries deception here will be liable to be 
fined up to 100 times of the amount in question." The narrative 
then made this comment: "Such a valuable mecantile tradition -- 
and how wise is Qi culture -- buried for a thousand years 
without ever being discovered by anybody. Why are there people 
viewing the mercantile spirit of our ancestors as something 
foreign and imported? Tradition is not antiques, much less 
luxury decoration, but wisdom waiting to be exhumed." The 
special was serious about exhuming the wisdom of Qi culture. It 
quotes Guan Zi saying: "If planting crops is the move for the 
year ahead and trees for the coming decade, then educating 
people is the move for a lifetime" This shows talent is the 
most valuable thing and the linchpin for success. 
  Why did the Zibo people shoot such a special at this time? 
Why were they so serious about tapping the mercantile spirit 
and talent concepts of Qi culture? Obviously this was driven by 
the need of developing the market economy. They approached and 
studied Qi culture from a new angle. What they tried was to 
graft an excellent traditional culture onto the modern market 
economy. This enterprise shows that the exploration for a 
modern market economy requires the assistance of "cultural 
power"; on other hand, culture also needs to locate a tremendous 
force within the market economy for development. In 
modernization, culture and the economy can never develop in 
parallel, never touching each other. The two interpenetrate and 
interact, "benefit from coordination and are impaired if split 
from each other." In studying the cultural trends of 
contemporary China, it pays to monitor closely the actual joints 
where the traditional culture is grafted onto and combined with 
the market economy, to care about, support, and study this 
process. 
  Such a "joining" can be seen in Singapore. Lu Shaochang, 
professor at Singapore National University, said: "In 
Singapore, apart from Chinese, there are Malays, Indians, and 
other ethnic people. Chinese account for three-fourths of the 
population, with Chinese culture as the dominant culture. But 
this Chinese culture is far away from the Chinese mainland. 
Perhaps because we are a migrant society and live in a 
community of different cultures, we are made to detect more 
easily the differences between ours and other cultures and we 
learn to treasure, value, and preserve this traditional culture, 
which in my mind means, of course, politeness, goodness, 
helpfulness, self-cultivation, patriotism, familial love, and 
other beauties of the Chinese race. This is what the world 
calls the soul of the Singaporean spiritual civilization." 
  Such a combination between traditional culture and market 
economy can also be seen in the development of modern Japanese 
capitalism. Tsuzumita Yoichi, dubbed "king of entrepreneurs," 
"financial lord" and founder of the Japanese-style organization 
of firms, has a pet formula, "Dialects plus abacus," which is 
also called the theory of "the unity of economics and ethics." 
  I am in great favor of such a view in traditional Chinese 
philosophy: Everything is born from genuine needs, so is 
development thereafter. These are the widest and most 
representative of human needs. The grafting and 
combination of traditional culture with the market economy 
taking place in the real life of contemporary China represents a 
genuine two-way need: The market economy needs the traditional 
culture, which needs to locate a new source of development in 
the market economy. Today, entrepreneurs and men of letters are 
becoming aware of, realizing, and going after this need, which 
of necessity will take culture to a new dimension and stage.

  [Text] Beijing, February 21 (CNS)--The social results in 
terms of studies or management turned out by the Chinese Academy 
of Social Sciences has failed to match the 5,000-strong academy, 
the president of the academy, Mr. Hu Sheng said. He added that 
the academy would be streamlined and more competitive with an 
incentive mechanism and elimination of the weak and promotion of 
the excellent with the aim of getting rid of redundant personnel 
not competent enough to undertake research work and those 
showing no academic achievements for years. 
  The academy has an average annual turnout of nearly 400 
books 
on special topics, some 3,000 treatises and 400 reports on 
research to be presented to the decision-making bodies and to 
the public. A large number of experts and scholars well known 
both at home and abroad work for this authoritative institution 
known as the brain of the entire country, making contributions 
to reform and opening to the outside world while at the same 
time devoting themselves to the pushing forward of basic studies. 
  Some members of the academy, however, are not so competent 
in 
undertaking social science study and research even though they 
may be good at other things and they produce no achievements 
during their time in the academy. 
  Mr. Hu said he believed that the current reform and economic 
build-up provided a wider scope for the social sciences and for 
personnel working in the field of human study and social 
science. He added that with this in mind the academy had to try 
its best to make better achievements. Mr. Hu revealed that the 
academy was determined to build up a streamlined social science 
force of high quality. The academy will first prevent swelling 
the ranks of its personnel while at the same time redundant 
personnel and those who had few academic achievements in a 
certain period of years will be dropped. Financial resources 
and strength will be poured into the backbone research and study 
carried out by elite researchers whose living and working 
conditions will be improved. 
  The academy will also give priority to key items under the 
circumstances where the appropriation for the academy is quite 
stringent and must centre its resources of personnel, finance 
and strength on major or significant items. The academy will 
make necessary adjustments to achieve this end.

  [Text] Beijing, February 21 (CNS)--Preparatory work on the 
setting up of an academician system for the Chinese Academy of 
Social Sciences is now underway and a proposal on its 
establishment is likely to be submitted to the leadership within 
this year. 
  President of the academy Mr. Hu Sheng revealed this news at 
a 
work meeting for 1994 held here today. He added that it was a 
necessity for such a system to be set up. Mr. Hu noted that the 
establishment of the academician system was considered an 
important measure for upgrading the prestige and status of the 
academy in international academic circles, enhancing the 
influence of the academy in these circles and helping realize 
the developmental strategy of the academy. 
  At the annual meeting, the academy confirmed clearly its 
goal 
for further development which involves the building of the 
academy into a national research centre on philosophy and the 
social sciences of a high level and of great vigor with the 
eventual aim of serving reform and opening to the outside world 
as well as material and spiritual civilization. 
  The academy has taken a number of measures for this end 
including the introduction of excellent scholars from outside 
the academy and from abroad for the undertaking of research. 
Mr. Hu said that this was aimed at attracting top-rate 
researchers in order to make the academy a real research centre 
for the social sciences and the humanities. 
  The social science sector in China has given a strong 
positive response to the establishment of the system and see it 
as an urgent need. The creation of such a system, however, 
involves many social science personnel coming from local 
branches of the academy as well from other government organs, 
the military force, higher learning institutions and party 
schools at various levels. It poses certain difficulties in its 
setting up, but with the creation and improvement of a system of 
this kind in the Chinese Academy of Sciences, it is inevitable 
for the social sciences academy to follow suit.

<F P=106> [From the "National Hookup" program] </F>
  [Text] The State Education Commission yesterday issued a 
circular in which it set forth its opinions on the 
implementation of new work hours in schools beginning on 1 March. 
  The circular stated: Following the nationwide implementation 
of new work hours, it will be appropriate for various schools at 
the secondary and above levels to first implement, on a trial 
basis, a system of five-and-a-half-day work weeks, in light of 
their special work conditions and teaching rules, provided there 
are no particular problems in doing so. Schools in the same 
district should try their best to implement a unified work-hour 
system. Provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly 
under the central government, or authorized prefectures and 
cities should make unified plans. Schools should appropriately 
modify the contents of their courses and curricula in accordance 
with the guidelines of the new work-hour system. 
  The circular urged educational administrative departments at 
all levels to make all kinds of preparations in earnest in 
accordance with the demands of the new work-hour system so as to 
ensure normal working and teaching order in schools after the 
new work-hour system is implemented.

<F P=106> [By Chi Haotian (6688 3185 3944): "Su Yu's Grandeur As a </F>
General Will Live Forever, His Art of Command Remains Applicable 
-- Marking the 10th Anniversary of Comrade Su Yu's Death"] 
  [Text] Ten years have elapsed since Comrade Su Yu passed 
away. We will cherish his memory forever. 
  I joined the Army in my early youth. I served under the 
command of Comrades Chen Yi and Su Yu, fighting in different 
parts of east China, and I directly perceived Comrade Su Yu's 
rare gifts and bold strategy in the art of war. Later on, I 
respectfully listened to his teachings. After he passed away, 
his wife, Elder Sister Chu Qing, presented me with the book 
Su Yu's Collections of the War Years. Through the 
study of Mao Zedong's military thinking, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
thinking on army building in the new period, of this military 
masterpiece -- which was the fruit of Comrade Su Yu's life-long 
labor -- and other articles recalling Comrade Su Yu, I have 
gained a further understanding of the brilliant art of military 
command as shown by this proletarian revolutionary and military 
strategist who made great contributions in the Chinese 
revolutionary war. Throughout his military life, Comrade Su Yu 
"had a loyal heart for his country while his hairs turned white 
in the war years," creatively studied and applied Mao Zedong's 
military thinking, and added rich and vivid content to Mao 
Zedong's military thinking with his own practice. He was an 
outstanding military scientist and strategist who had both 
military theory and operational command practice. While 
fighting in battlefields, he cleverly devised strategies and 
thus led brilliant military successes. A devoted military 
officer with a lofty spirit and great force of character, he led 
troops and high-ranking military officers. He wrote books with 
unique original ideas and penetrating judgments. He deserves to 
be called a famous combat general commanding a million bold 
warriors. The legacy of his superb sense of command and his 
refinement as a general constitute a precious spiritual heritage. 
  Being strategically minded as a commander of tactical 
operations was the important characteristic of Comrade Su Yu, 
who directed military operations with miraculous skill. Comrade 
Su Yu was a commander of tactical operations, but he would 
always conscientiously take the overall strategic situation into 
account as the starting point in reflecting on problems. During 
the 22 years of his combat career, Comrade Su Yu held important 
leadership posts in the relatively independent war zones, which 
were far away from the central authorities. While undertaking a 
combat task, he would attach great importance to the advantages 
and disadvantages and losses and gains of its implementation 
from the height of the overall strategic situation. He 
approached and pondered problems from a broad and far-reaching 
point of view and thus managed to serve, influence, and push the 
overall situation ahead conscientiously and freely with active 
and effective partial operations. The famous campaigns, which 
Comrade Su Yu directly conducted or in which he was engaged, 
included the central Jiangsu, south Shandong, Laizhou-Wuhu, 
Menglianggu, Shatuji, east Henan, Jinan, and Huaihai campaigns. 
He made proposals or tactical assumptions of his own accord for 
almost all of the campaigns, which were carried out after they 
had been approved by the Central Military Commission and Comrade 
Mao Zedong. These numerous major campaigns constituted the 
basic trend in east and central China in the Liberation War and 
realized the strategic intentions of the supreme command in a 
powerful manner. 
  Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "The most important thing 
for those who direct the situation as a whole is to devote their 
attention to the overall war situation." In making military 
plans, Comrade Su Yu could not only give consideration to the 
situation in a specific war zone, but also kept his eyes on the 
overall strategic situation, set store by the overall situation 
and the strategic interests, and he did not hesitate to make the 
greatest sacrifices in terms of partial interests. For example, 
in the summer of 1947, to coordinate with the strategic move 
taken by the Li Bocheng-Deng Xiaoping Army to thrust into the 
Dabie Shan by leaping from 1,000 li away from the Dabie Shan -- 
while deciding without the slightest hesitation to leave some 
troops behind and encouraging them to support the extremely grim 
situation in Shandong and to do what they could to break through 
the enemy's selective attacks -- Comrades Chen Yi and Su Yu led 
the regular formations of the East China Field Army in rushing 
westward and launched attacks on exterior lines, thus creating 
the situation in which the Liu Bocheng-Deng Xiaoping Army, the 
Chen Geng-Xie Fuzhi Army, and the Chen Yi-Su Yu Army were 
bidding for state power. 
  As the commander of a strategic area, Comrade Su Yu was 
admired for his boldness and adeptness in independently 
considering the issues which had a bearing on the overall war 
situation and promptly putting forth strategic proposals to the 
Military Commission. For example, in the early days of the 
Liberation War, his suggestion of first fighting on interior 
lines by relying on the liberated areas played an important role 
in changing the Central Military Commission's strategic 
principle of "launching attacks on exterior lines while going 
southward to conduct operations" into the principle of "first 
winning several battles on interior lines before turning to 
exterior lines." In the spring of 1948, his suggestion that the 
army under Su's command stay for the time being in central China 
to fight large-scale battles of annihilation rather than cross 
the river and swiftly open up the war situation in central China 
after achieving combat successes played a very good role in 
urging the Central Military Commission to determine to fight a 
strategic, decisive battle with the enemy. In the autumn of 
1948, he suggested launching the Huaihai Campaign and further 
suggested cutting the Xuzhou-Bengpu line and annihilating the 
enemy's main forces in the places north to the Chang Jiang, thus 
greatly accelerating the victorious process of the national 
liberation war. 
  It is very important for a military commander, a 
high-ranking 
commander in particular, to have a strong strategic awareness, 
be good at clearly discerning the changing situation, and grasp 
the developing overall situation. With profound understanding, 
Comrade Su Yu said: "As a military commander, one must 
understand the strategic issue of the Chinese Liberation War. 
Only when he has a profound understanding of the issue and can 
keep a clear head can he devise strategies and direct operations 
with facility." 
  Drawing strategic plans and making analyses systematically 
are the main secrets of Comrade Su Yu's calm generalship. In 
organizing every campaign, Comrade Su Yu would always 
systematically draw up a plan after careful consideration to 
ensure that the plan was well-designed for carrying out schemes 
to give the enemy a false impression to lead them to make 
errors, for creating determination to launch operations, for 
starting a campaign to withdraw from battlefields to plan the 
next campaign, and for improving operational command to logistic 
support and to ideological education. In terms of mode of 
thinking, Comrade Su Yu's operational planning was identical 
with the basic viewpoints of modern operational systems 
engineering. The east Henan campaign was the masterpiece of 
Comrade Su Yu's systematic planning in operational command, and 
is of immortal military and academic value. 
  In planning the campaign, Comrade Su Yu considered the war 
situation in central China as a big system. After giving 
consideration to the situations of both the enemy and his own 
army in central China, to the East China Field Army, and the 
Central China Field Army, and to the war zone's favorable 
climatic condition (being at the stage of a strategic turning 
point), favorable geographical condition (vast areas and smooth 
terrain are favorable for our regular army formations' mobile 
operations), and favorable human condition (with Shandong and 
the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan liberated area behind, the new 
liberated area in central China had begun to take shape) and 
comparing the advantages and disadvantages of conducting 
operations in central China and by crossing the Chang Jiang, 
Comrade Su Yu reached the conclusion that it was more 
advantageous to concentrate forces to conduct operations in 
central China than to cross the Chang Jiang and swiftly open the 
situation in central China, that it was imperative to fight 
large-scale battles of annihilation, and the condition for 
fighting such battles in central China was basically ripe. This 
was the basic operational assumption for concentrating forces to 
fight sizable battles in central China. On this basis, Comrade 
Su Yu further made an quantitative and qualitative analysis and 
by following the central demands, clearly defined that the basic 
goal of operations for the near future was to annihilate 5 or 6 
to 11 or 12 enemy brigades in the Huang He-Huai He area. 
  From the viewpoint of systematics, Comrade Su Yu's planning 
and direction of operations fully embodied the principle of 
"appropriate selection of the superior." In military struggle, 
the weighing of "discard" and "take" and decisionmaking are full 
of dialectics. Everyone who has some knowledge of the theory of 
systematics knows that the operations system is a dynamic system 
under which two living forces sharply confront each other and 
undergo drastic changes, and commanders of the opposing sides 
will make strenuous efforts to annihilate their enemy and 
achieve the "maximum value" of systems planning. However, 
although the "maximum value" exists in theory, it is difficult 
to achieve in reality. As such, military commanders are 
required to be good at judging the hour and sizing up the 
situation, weighing the advantages and disadvantages, and having 
the courage to "discard" while being good at "taking," and 
direct operations in a lively way. Comrade Su Yu attained 
perfection in this regard. 
  At the beginning of the east Henan campaign, a method of 
"catching big fish" was adopted to annihilate the enemy's 
reorganized 5th Army and at the same time, Comrade Su Yu had 
worked out a plan to storm Kaifeng and then annihilate the enemy 
relief force. The enemy's reinforced 5th Army was Chiang 
Kai-shek's "elite" unit and the main force of the Qiu Qingquan 
Army in the battlefields of central China. Annihilating it 
would open the war situation in central China. Naturally, that 
was a "maximum value." When the Third and Eighth Columns under 
the command of the East China Field Army were moving from the 
Xichang area to Huaiyang, the Qiu Army, which was stationed in 
the southwestern region of Shandong, was lured by our forces and 
rushed southward. By seizing the opportunity, the main forces 
of the East China Field Army crossed the Huang He from the 
Puyang area. At that time, shocked by the move, the enemy 
supreme command swiftly ordered the main forces of the Qiu Army 
and the reorganized 75th Division to return to the north at top 
speed so as to block our troops from crossing the river. At the 
same time, they reinforced the area by dispatching three more 
reorganized divisions and a brigade. For a while, big armies 
converged there, and moreover, it was not easy to break up the 
reorganized 5th Army, the main force of the Qiu Army, as it was 
neatly deployed. As the enemy advanced, we retreated, and the 
conditions to annihilate the 5th Army had not matured, but the 
opportunity of first attacking Kaifeng and then annihilating the 
enemy reinforcements had emerged. By this time, our Third and 
Eighth Columns had entered Tongxu, Weixian, and Jixian, a 
one-day journey to Kaifeng, the capital of Henan under the 
Kuomintang government. Although the city was guarded by more 
than 30,000 enemy troops, their combat capability was poor as 
they were not under unified command; moreover, they were in a 
state of isolation and the regular army formations that could be 
moved to reinforce them were deployed 100 kilometers away from 
the capital. On the contrary, the regular formations of the 
East China Field Army and a unit under the command of the 
Central China Field Army were deployed relatively closely. In 
terms of timing and position, capturing the city was like taking 
something from one's pocket and attacking the enemy 
reinforcements was like casting a net to catch fish. Comrade Su 
Yu determinedly discarded the pursuit of the expected "maximum 
value" and made a prompt decision to strive for the relatively 
realistic "satisfaction value" of attacking Kaifeng and 
annihilating the enemy reinforcements. In the course of 
operations, he was considering creating conditions for the 
coming operations. To ensure the victory of the current 
campaign, once again Comrade Su Yu discarded the pursuit of the 
"maximum value" of completely annihilating the surviving forces 
of the enemy's besieged reorganized 72th Division and 
concentrated forces to attack the Huang Botao Army, which 
frenziedly advanced toward our positions in an attempt to 
overwhelm our forces. With overriding momentum, he attacked the 
enemy forces in their early move, thus overawing the other enemy 
reinforcements and gaining the "satisfaction value" of 
victorious troop shifts. 
  By continuously devising brilliant moves and blazing new 
trails, Comrade Su Yu was able to win every battle he fought. 
Marshal Chen Yi said: "In directing battles, General Su Yu has 
consistently maintained his record of being invincible. The 
more moves he devises, the more brilliant they will become, and 
the more battles he fights, the more brilliantly he does." As I 
understand it, this remark was not only praise for Comrade Su 
Yu, but also an indication of one characteristic of his art of 
war, namely, continuously bringing forth new ideas which are 
"boundless like heaven and earth and inexhaustible like the 
rivers" rather than confining oneself to set rules. It was 
precisely his ability to "devise a brilliant move in every 
battle he fights" that enabled him to "fight the battle more and 
more brilliantly." 
  In his article "Develop Ourselves in the Enemy's Rear Areas 
in Jiangsu and Zhejiang and the Tianmu Shan Campaign," there 
were remarks full of military philosophy. He wrote: "In 
fighting battles, dialectics is necessary, because both sides 
are living persons in action and like ourselves, the enemy can 
use their brains and can walk. While fighting, they can change 
their tactics. We have to follow suit. Even if they do not 
change their tactics, we must change our tactics in light of the 
changes in the battlefields." Comrade Su Yu was well versed in 
military dialectics. Like everything, war undergoes constant 
change as time, place, and conditions change. No two operations 
are completely the same. Military tactics are bound to differ 
in thousands of ways. War is a field full of vitality. Only a 
military strategist who has a trailblazing spirit and keeps 
forging ahead can establish himself in an unassailable position. 
  In operations, Comrade Su Yu boldly blazed new trails and 
adopted appropriate measures as time, geological conditions, and 
the enemy's situation changed. In the central Jiangsu campaign, 
he carefully directed one live drama full of power and grandeur 
after another. In the first battle he launched in Xuanjiabao and 
Taixing, he directed troops in an unusual way: Annihilating the 
enemy troops before they managed to take action by adopting a 
counteroffensive method. In the battle of Runan, he ignored the 
closer enemy positions and led his troops 100 li away and then 
stormed the enemy from their flanks and rear. In the Haian 
battle, he blunted the edge of the enemy's advance while beating 
them back. In the Libao battle, he commanded his troops to 
launch a surprise attack on the enemy while they had their heads 
turned by "victory celebrations." In the Dingyan-Linzi battle, 
selecting the enemy's weak points, he directed his troops in 
launching a frontal attack on the enemy, and later on, in 
attacking Huang (Qiao) to rescue Shao (Bo), he commanded his 
troops to go deep into the enemy's hinterland to carry out 
operations there. Thus he successfully applied the Chinese 
ancient military tactic of "besieging the State of Wei to rescue 
the State of Zhao" in a tactical operation. It helped 
energetically support Shao Bo's operations and annihilate 17,000 
enemy troops in the operation. The enemy were so badly beaten 
that they were reduced to a state of utter stupefaction and were 
completely at a loss. Comrade Su Yu commanded a 30,000-strong 
army to confront an enemy army 120,000 strong. His troops 
fought the enemy for 18 months in the strategic forward areas 
close to the enemy's heartland, won the seven battles they 
fought, and annihilated more than 50,000 enemy troops. This was 
rarely seen in the history of war. In the Menglianggu battle, 
when the strong enemy forces converged to launch selective 
attacks on our forces, in accordance with Chen Yi's instructions 
and by making full use of the favorable condition that our 
troops fought in the hinterland of the liberated areas, Comrade 
Su Yu adopted the method of "playing a dragon lantern" -- 
sometimes fighting in the south and sometimes in the north, 
sometimes in the east and sometimes in the west, and sometimes 
advancing and sometimes retreating, and fighting while 
retreating -- and created opportunities to fight. By seizing 
the opportunity of the enemy elite force, the reorganized 74th 
Division, made a central breakthrough and, using the tactic of 
"a fierce tiger ripping out the heart of its prey," he assigned 
five columns the task of surrounding and annihilating the enemy 
and four columns the task of blocking the enemy relief force and 
ordered his troops to thrust into the middle of the enemy battle 
formation to cut the 14th Division's ties with its friendly 
neighboring units, thus wiping out the whole division in one 
fell swoop and creating the miracle of "chopping off the head of 
a general in an army one million strong." This was also an 
example of Comrade Su Yu's "marvelous" art of war. 
  There are rules, but not hard and fast rules, to follow in 
directing operations. In directing operations, Comrade Su Yu 
would always seek rules outside the established ones, and seek 
original changes. In the Laizhou-Wuhu campaign, by adopting the 
tactic of feinting to the east and attacking in the west, while 
putting a military presence in south Shandong, he launched a 
decisive battle in central Shandong. In the Wusong-Shanghai 
campaign, while attacking Wusong, he adopted the tactic of 
making a feint to the east and attacking the east and directed 
this offensive at the enemy's main and strong positions so as to 
lure more enemy troops to bite the hook. In the Huaihai 
Campaign, he adopted the tactic of "leaving the unconditioned as 
it stands and making the best of everything" and gave the enemy 
in Xuzhou a way out. In the Jinan campaign, he adopted the 
tactic of "leaving the conditioned as it stands and making the 
best of everything" and by ordering a 180,000-strong army to 
prepare to attack the enemy relief force, he clearly stated to 
the enemy that so long as you had the courage to come, we were 
in a position to annihilate you. In terms of ambush, sometimes 
he ambushed the rescuing, retreating or "passing-by" enemy 
troops and sometimes he "lured the enemy by promise of gain" or 
"threatened them by force." In terms of encirclement and 
annihilation, he sometimes "encircled a division and destroyed 
one-tenth of its force [wei shi que yi 0953 1597 7067 0001]," 
sometimes he "encircled the enemy without destroying it," 
sometimes he laid a long-term encirclement on the enemy, and 
sometimes he annihilated the enemy the moment he encircled them. 
In terms of besieging a city to annihilate the enemy relief 
force, sometimes he made a faked besieging a city but attacked 
the enemy relief force in reality. He sometimes faked attacking 
the enemy relief force but actually besieged or captured the 
city while attacking the enemy relief force. This endless 
change in his use of stratagems was a vivid embodiment of 
Comrade Su Yu's outstanding ability to command. 
  Being brave, fearless, capable, industrious, and prudent 
constituted the solid foundation for Comrade Su Yu to put 
himself in a superior position against the enemy in the sharp 
and complicated military struggles. He was well-known for 
daring to fight big battles, tough battles, and fierce battles. 
During his 22 years of military life in battlefields, he always 
used a small force to defeat a large one, used a weak force to 
fight a strong one, destroyed enemy strongholds and took the 
edge off the enemy's spirit, and inflicted repeated reverses on 
a formidable enemy. He had unusual revolutionary courage and 
resourcefulness. Nevertheless, in reviewing his brilliant 
battlefield experience full of "shining spears and armored 
horses and daring" in those years, this battle-tested veteran 
general with several decades of military life made such remarks 
as "the burden is heavy" and "I feel nervous," and made no 
mention of his bravery. When recalling his feelings on the eve 
of the decisive Huangqiao battle, he said: "The responsibility 
for the success or failure of the battle rests completely with 
us. In a situation in which we are outnumbered by the enemy, 
the burden we are shouldering is very heavy." When recalling 
the central Jiangsu campaign, he stated: "In helping Comrade 
Chen Yi direct the Subei campaign, I deeply feel that I have a 
grave responsibility and I feel nervous." In speaking of the 
Shatuji campaign, he remarked: "Now I feel I have a grave 
responsibility." In talking about his feelings when he was 
ordered to plan operations for east Henan, he said: "I deeply 
feel the burden I am shouldering is heavy and I feel I issued a 
'military order' to the central authorities this time" and it 
was not until Kaifeng was captured that he said "I feel secure." 
These thought-provoking records genuinely and vividly reflected 
Comrade Su Yu's fine character of being brave and fearless, 
capable, industrious, and prudent. 
  The confrontation of two armies is not only a contest in 
military strength, firepower, and morale, but also a contest in 
the astuteness and resourcefulness and the art of command and of 
both sides' commanders. Under given conditions, more often than 
not, victory hangs on a momentary slip of the commanders. 
Therefore, their burdens cannot be said to be light and they 
cannot be said not to feel nervous. The feelings that "I am 
shouldering a heavy burden" and "I feel nervous" precisely 
reflected Comrade Su Yu's high level of responsibility to the 
party's cause and extreme prudence in directing military 
operations. In studying the many campaigns Comrade Su Yu 
directed, we all felt they were soul- stirring. A careful study 
shows that he did not have the slightest idea of winning by 
fluke. His profound idea of creating a spirited atmosphere 
using strategy and the superb art of command are admirable. 
Comrade Su Yu led troops in crossing the natural chasm -- the 
Chang Jiang -- at full speed three times. Whether he led 
several hundred troops in sneaking across the river or commanded 
a 100,000-strong army in forging the river, he always "made 
serious preparations and worked out well-conceived plans" and 
directed the operations by "centering his complete concentration 
on" them. Hence, no errors were made. In the second phase of 
the Huaihai Campaign, he did not sleep for seven days and nights 
and later on, he contracted Meniere's syndrome and still he 
directed military operations in spite of illness. It was said 
that Marshal Chen Yi praised Comrade Su Yu as a "Master Zhuge 
who eats less but attends to numerous things." This was a vivid 
embodiment of Comrade Su Yu's fine style of working diligently 
and rigorously, sparing no pains. Comrade Mao Zedong urged 
commanders to become brave and wise generals. Comrade Su Yu may 
be rated as a good example in this regard. 
  Persisting in seeking truth from facts, proceeding in all 
cases from actual conditions, and taking the unity of subjective 
guidance and objective reality as the basic principle and 
requirement for directing military operations constituted the 
essence of Comrade Su Yu's art of command. Comrade Su Yu 
studied war realistically and worked hard to probe the objective 
laws governing war. He said: "In my youth, I studied how to 
lead troops and fight with Commissar Mao [Zedong] and Army 
Commander Zhu [De]. The most profound experience I gained is 
that war has its own laws. We must seek the method of 
vanquishing the enemy in accordance with the actual conditions 
of the enemy and ourselves and the inherent laws governing war. 
This truth has benefited me all my life." In studying war, 
with his eyes focused on characteristics and development, 
Comrade Su Yu was good at grasping the laws governing war at 
different levels and periods. For example, his theory of a 
"turning point" in operations direction divides war into three 
levels: The strategic turning point of the overall war 
situation, the periodical turning point of the war zone, and the 
turning point of the process of campaigns. When the Liberation 
War was imminent, in the light of the changed new situation, 
Comrade Su Yu "repeatedly pondered so as to seek the laws 
governing the war, in particular, the laws governing the early 
period of the war." Until his evening years he was still 
working hard to probe the laws governing modern war. 
  In directing war, Comrade Su Yu always combined the higher 
authorities' instructions and actual conditions and creatively 
implemented the higher authorities' intentions. He persisted in 
going deep into the realities of life to conduct studies and 
familiarize himself with the various aspects of the situation of 
the enemy and ourselves, sought the laws governing military 
actions, and applied these laws to his own operations, and 
ensured the unity of subjective guidance and objective realities. 
  "Fight battles wherever it is convenient for us to wipe out 
the enemy, fight battles whenever it is convenient to wipe out 
the enemy, and attack the enemy whom it is convenient for us to 
wipe out." This idea completely stresses basing oneself on 
actual conditions. 
  Comrade Su Yu was not only good at integrating the universal 
truth of Mao Zedong's military thinking and the concrete 
practice of directing operations, but also good at summing up 
practical experience and condensing and upgrading it into 
theory. In his remaining years, he devoted himself to summing 
up his operations experience. While writing his recollections, 
he insisted in "writing real past events" and worked hard to 
"accurately reflect how the understanding and mastery of the 
laws governing war by the commander of a campaign leads to a 
victory or a loss." He maintained: "If we describe the complex 
war process as a process which has been well planned by wise 
commanders and use this idea to educate our coming generations, 
this will get us into trouble when a war breaks out." This 
fully demonstrates the firmness and persistence of a proletarian 
military strategist in upholding the ideological line of seeking 
truth from facts. 
  The best way to commemorate Comrade Su Yu is to learn his 
art 
of command and decorum as a general, realistically study the 
military struggles under the conditions of contemporary 
technology, in particular, high technology, more conscientiously

<F P=106> [By Reporter Cao Zhi (2580 2535)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 12 Feb (XINHUA) -- The People's 
Liberation Army [PLA] -- while implementing readjustment and 
reform -- has paid great attention to quality in its logistics 
work. It has explored ways to build a new type of logistics 
support under the new setting of a socialist market economy, 
and, by relying on improved management and technical progress, 
brought about significant changes in the supply of basic 
necessities, including clothing, food, shelter, and transport. 
As of last year, 1.2 million officers and men had moved into 
new, modern barracks. 
  The improvement in the appearance and bearing of the 
soldiers 
has further enhanced the image of our mighty force. On 1 May, 
all the rank-and-file and some officers were issued new 
camouflage [mi cai 6617 1752] training suits. Junior officers 
have been issued whipcord winter uniforms. Service-wide 
issuance of 87-style regular uniforms, training suits, and work 
clothes that started in 1988 has been completed; in torrid, 
chilly, and coastal defense regions, the officers and soldiers 
have also been issued specially-made vests, winter clothes, or 
water-proof gear to be worn on patrol missions. 
  As restrictions on the market are being lifted, living 
standards in the barracks have remained, more or less, stable. 
Early last year, the Central Military Commission [CMC] spelled 
out clearly the principle that in military spending, it is 
necessary to guarantee the needs of the soldiers' daily lives. 
The standards for a soldier's allowance and board expenses have 
been raised. The military also had a good harvest of grain and 
nonstaple foodstuffs last year. During the year it produced 660 
million kg of grain, 220 million kg of meat and eggs, and 610 
million kg of vegetables. Wider use of greenhouses and large 
sheds to grow vegetables has enabled troops stationed in 
Xinjiang, Tibet, and Hainan to have fresh vegetables in winter. 
  New barracks have been built at the grassroots in the 
military. Last year, the military started, on a scale never seen 
in the history of PLA, renovations of barracks. Units in charge 
of barracks construction at all levels have sent engineers and 
close to 100 task forces to help the grassroots units draw up 
plans and designs for barracks construction. Many units also 
took it upon themselves to manufacture bricks and tiles and 
collect rocks in an effort to reduce production costs. It has 
been learned that after the renovation, the pass rate of the 
military's barracks is now 100 percent; and 50 percent of them 
are rated excellent. 
  Logistics work has also benefited from the marked increase 
in the military's capacity for rapid shipment. Whenever there 
are major military operations, the army has been able to 
organize mechanical transport to quickly ship personnel and 
materials to where they are needed, thereby ensuring successful 
accomplishment of assignments such as military exercises, 
emergency action needed because of natural disasters, and relief 
operations. The various units, which are equipped with driving 
crews and other specialized personnel, are capable, by and 
large, of getting their truck convoys into action at any time. 
Army units and local departments in charge of transportation 
and war preparedness have worked together in renovating or 
building a number of new national defense and coastal defense 
highways. The units are also beginning to get cooking cars, 
bakery cars, and refrigerator cars used for logistics support in 
field operations.

<F P=106> [Report by reporter Tang Pingyue (0781 1627 1471): "The PLA </F>
General Political Department Has Promulgated the `Regulations 
(Trial Implementation) on Strengthening and Improving 
Ideological and Political Education in Grass-Roots Units"] 
  [Text] Not long ago, the General Political Department 
issued to the entire Army the "Regulations (Trial 
Implementation) on Strengthening and Improving Ideological and 
Political Education in Grass-Roots Units," urging every unit to 
treat these regulations as the basis for organizing and 
conducting ideological and political education at the 
grass-roots level and conscientiously implement them in light of 
practical conditions. 
  The "Regulations (Trial Implementation) on Strengthening and 
Improving Ideological and Political Education in Grass-Roots 
Units" were laid down according to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of army building in the new period and the relevant 
guidelines laid down by the Central Military Commission and on 
the basis of inheriting the fine tradition of our Army's 
political and ideological education and of summing up our Army's 
reform experience in political education. Opinions had been 
widely solicited in the whole Army before the document was 
issued to units at the lower levels. 
  The document put forward suggestions for improvement and 
made 
concrete stipulations on the guiding principles, the content of 
education, the method of organization and implementation, the 
system and form of education, and other issues related to 
ideological and political education in the grass-roots units. 
Compared with past practices, these regulations realize the 
spirit of being essential and effective in the content of 
education and set up, in a relatively stable manner, six 
branches of study, specifically, the study of the basic party 
line, the study of current affairs and policies, the study of 
our Army's glorious tradition and patriotism, the study of the 
revolutionary soldiers' outlook on life and values, the study of 
legal knowledge, and the study of circumstances and combat 
readiness, with each focusing on key points in a concise manner. 
As far as the goals of education are concerned, attention is 
paid to different categories of people at different levels; the 
ideological education of cadres at the grass-roots level is 
standardized; and different demands are set for new soldiers, 
veterans, and volunteers. As far as the system and method of 
education is are concerned, the emphasis is on doing well the 
three links of preparatory educational meetings, preparing 
lessons and giving lectures, and organizing class discussions. 
Units are being asked to set up systems for an educational 
week, for listening to and watching the news, for reading 
newspapers and writing reports on current affairs and policies, 
for taking attendance, for giving supplementary lessons and 
evaluations, and for inspection and supervision. Moreover, nine 
patterns and methods of education are summarized: classroom 
education, individual education, random education, mass 
self-education, ways to integrate army units with families and 
society, ways to apply education to cultural life in the 
barracks, the application of modernized education, ways to 
publicize typical examples, and ways to create a good 
educational environment. 
  The document stressed that every ideological and political 
education activity in the grass-roots units must be close to 
reality and must strive for practical results. In organizing 
and conducting educational activities, it is necessary to be 
familiar with the objects of education; to conduct ideological 
and political education in military training and various 
practical activities; to strengthen behavioral guidance so as to 
cultivate, learn, and manifest decent behavior through 
education; and to strive to display each unit's distinctive 
features in light of its own characteristics so as to improve 
the effect of education and to vigorously guard against 
formalism. 
  The document made explicit demands on the task of 
strengthening the administration of ideological and political 
education in grass-roots units: First, when making arrangements 
for educational activities, units at all levels must give full 
consideration to grass-roots units' receptivity, take notice of 
unforeseen circumstances, and refrain from increasing burdens at 
each level; second, propaganda departments are in charge of 
various educational activities; third, brigades and regiments 
must coordinate the activities, ensuring that they are proceeded 
in a normal and orderly manner and that the prescribed 
educational tasks are fulfilled. 
  The document also urged various units to accomplish the work 
of protecting the service of ideological and political education 
in grass-roots units and to conscientiously strengthen the 
building of the contingent of teachers and the construction of 
teaching facilities.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Conscientiously Conduct </F>
Ideological and Political Education in Grass-Roots Units in 
Accordance With the `Regulations'"] 
  [Text] The General Political Department has promulgated 
the "Regulations on Strengthening and Improving Ideological and 
Political Education in Grass-Roots Units" for trial 
implementation. This is an important measure for implementing 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of army building and the 
instructions and guidelines of the Central Party Committee and 
the Central Military Commission on strengthening and improving 
ideological and political work in the new period. It also 
represents a major event in strengthening grass-roots 
construction. 
  Firm and vigorous ideological and political education is our 
Army's fine tradition and political superiority. Under the new 
situation of fully implementing reform and developing a 
socialist market economy, ideological and political education 
can only be strengthened rather than weakened. The national 
work meeting on propaganda and ideology, which was held not long 
ago, urged the whole party to strengthen and improve propaganda 
and ideological work under the new situation. General Secretary 
Jiang Zemin profoundly expounded the important position, 
fundamental guiding principle, and major tasks of propaganda and 
ideological work in the new period from the high plane of the 
overall work situation of the whole party, thus further pointing 
out the correct way and setting very high demands on us to 
accomplish propaganda and ideological work and conduct 
ideological and political education well. The General Political 
Department promulgated the regulations on the basis of full 
investigation and proof and of pooling the whole Army's wisdom, 
which not only inherited our Army's fine tradition of 
ideological and political education but also drew on the 
successful experience since the Third Plenary Session of the 
11th Central Party Committee, thus reflecting the objective 
demand for strengthening and improving ideological and political 
education in grass-roots units under the new situation. This 
document is the basis for organizing and conducting ideological 
and political education in grass-roots units as well as the 
embodiment of the "Program for Army Building at the Grass-Roots 
Level" in ideological and political education. Units at all 
levels must conscientiously implement these regulations in light 
of reality. 
  To implement the Regulations, we must, in the first place, 
study and be familiar with them. When organizing grass-roots 
cadres to study the program, all units must treat the study of 
the regulations as an important activity; brigades and regiments 
must integrate with preparatory educational meetings to 
constantly organize grass-roots political cadres to study the 
regulations; and political cadres must consider the regulations 
as the teaching material for professional study. Political 
cadres at all levels should understand the fundamental spirit of 
the regulations, should be familiar with the basic substance and 
requirements of the regulations, should define their own duties, 
and should comprehend the basic method for conducting education 
in accordance with the regulations. 
  To implement the regulations, we must conscientiously work 
in 
accordance with their requirements. The purpose of drawing up 
this document is precisely to guide concrete work. Therefore, 
it would be meaningless if this document were to be pigeonholed 
and the regulations were not put into effect. Leaders and 
political organs at all levels must organize and guide education 
in accordance with the regulations, whereas grass-roots units 
must conduct education in accordance with the regulations. It 
is necessary to have a greater awareness of the laws and 
regulations and conscientiously uphold the solemnity of the 
regulations. The regulations must be set as the criteria of 
making arrangements for educational activities, for inspecting 
the situation of conducting education, and for evaluating 
educational results. We must straighten out relationships 
between various sectors, improve the administration of 
ideological and political education at the grass-roots level, 
and establish a normal educational order in accordance with the 
regulations. 
  To implement the regulations, we must integrate them with 
educational practices. This year, all types of educational 
activities must be organized and implemented in accordance with 
the requirements of the regulations. Moreover, we must 
constantly enhance our understanding and heighten our capability 
of conducting education in accordance with the regulations. We 
must accelerate the implementation of all types of educational 
activities through the regulations and properly implement the 
regulations in the process of conducting education. 
  To properly implement the regulations, the involvement of 
leaders and political organs at all levels is essential. It is 
not easy to draw up a good document, and it is even more 
difficult to put it into effect, because we have to do a 
substantial amount of painstaking work. Every unit must do all 
it can to give wide publicity to the regulations within the Army 
so as to build up a certain public opinion and momentum. Every 
unit must integrate the regulations with its own conditions in 
putting forward concrete measures for implementing the 
regulations, to take the initiative in studying how to solve the 
conflicts and problems in implementing the regulations on a 
trial basis, and to create favorable conditions for implementing 
the regulations. Leaders at all levels, in particular political 
commissars and directors of political departments, must take the 
initiative to study the regulations, to give publicity to the 
regulations, and to implement the regulations, thus setting an 
example for the grass-roots units. 
  The regulations are the product of integrating the 
inheritance of fine traditions with reform and innovation. That 
is, in implementing the regulations, we must also strive for 
reform and innovation on the basis of inheriting our Army's fine 
tradition of political education. We must constantly study new 
conditions, solve new problems, use new experiences and 
achievements to enrich and perfect the regulations, and treat 
the implementation of the regulations as a process of constantly 
deepening the reform of ideological and political education in 
grass-roots units. We believe that, with the implementation of 
the regulations, we will definitely be able to score greater 
achievements in conducting ideological and political education 
in the grass-roots units.

  [Text] Beijing, 17 Feb (XINHUA) -- According to JIEFANJUN 
BAO [LIBERATION ARMY DAILY], in line with a Central Military 
Commission [CMC] directive, the General Staff Headquarters and 
General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army 
[PLA] issued a joint circular the other day instructing units to 
formulate overall plans for building up the ranks of minority 
cadres. It calls for stepping up recruiting and training to 
build a well-structured contingent of minority cadres who are 
politically qualified, competent, and meet the needs of 
modernization of the armed forces. 
  The circular notes that in units stationed in areas where 
people of minority nationalities live in compact communities, 
leading bodies at the regiment level or higher should include a 
minority cadre. Army organs at all levels and people's armed 
force departments at the county and city level should have a 
certain number of minority cadres. To raise the quality of 
minority cadres, designated academies or colleges should -- 
where the number of minority soldiers undertaking courses 
justifies doing so -- set up a special class to improve their 
literacy levels. Training courses for Tibetan youngsters should 
be instituted on a experimental basis at relevant academies and 
schools to recruit Tibetan primary school and middle school 
students. After undergoing systematic training, they should be 
assigned as cadres to army units. Meanwhile, efforts should be 
made to recruit more minority graduates of regular institutes of 
higher learning and secondary vocational schools who are good in 
both conduct and learning, to replenish the ranks of army 
cadres. The circular also calls for implementing a preferential 
policy for minority cadres regarding retirement and job 
placement after demobilization. 
  It has been learned that the CMC attaches great importance 
to 
the development of the ranks of minority cadres in the military. 
The CMC has emphasized again and again that this work should be 
carried out as part and parcel of the development of the ranks 
of army cadres as a whole. As things stand now, over 80 percent 
of minority cadres in the military have undergone training in 
academies and colleges. In light of the characteristics of the 
growth of minority cadres, special consideration has been given 
to job assignments and promotions of minority cadres so that 
they can give the best account of their talents. Tens of 
thousands of fine minority cadres in leadership posts at all 
levels throughout the army -- who make up an important force in 
the construction of our military -- are putting their talents to 
good use. According to statistics, among the cadres of 
Mongolia, Hui, Tibetan, Uygur, Zhuang, Korean, Man, Dong, Bai, 
Tujia, and Ewenki nationalities on active duty in the service, 
over 40 have been appointed the rank of major general or higher. 
The development of the contingent of minority cadres has served 
as a powerful boost for the modernization of armed forces, and 
for the enhancement of the army-civilian and national unity.

friendship and conferred on general plans to develop Anhui and 
to promote double-support work. 
  Lu Rongjing, secretary of the provincial party committee,

and led by the provincial party committee, Anhui's people have 
liberated their minds; have united and forged ahead; have 
comprehensively implemented the party's basic line; have 
resolutely and unwaveringly accelerated reform and progress; and 
have strengthened and improved macroeconomic regulation and 
control. Consequently, Anhui has made remarkable strides in

developing, and improving military-civilian ties"; has 
concentrated energies on developing social productive forces and 
on raising military fighting capacity; has conscientiously 
promoted double-support activities; and has continually 
consolidated and developed new relations between the military 
and the people, whereby "their hearts are linked togehter and 
beat as one, and they share a common destiny." Anhui has made 
progress in expanding the scope and content of double-support 
work; and has improved the overall standards of the activities. 
Therefore, the general situation has been very good. 
  Speaking at the meeting were responsible comrades from 
Military Unit No. 80302 garrisoned in Anhui, from the Hefei City

  [Text] The Air Force's aviation control unit, which is in 
charge of managing and directing China's air traffic, has 
formulated a comprehensive system for civilian flight safety. 
Imbued with a profound sense of responsibility, officers of 
this special unit have played an active role in the first 
national flight safety month this year. 
  At present, over 10,000 airplanes fly daily on 845 civil 
aviation routes nationwide. To ensure smooth and safe flights 
for airplanes, the Air Force aviation control unit has developed 
a comprehensive system of air traffic control rules and 
regulations, such as basic flight rules and flight control 
regulations, which are compatible with China's national 
conditions. The Air Force has allocated 40 percent of its 
radars operating daily to serve the needs of civil aviation. 
Moreover, the Air Force has vacated nearly 400 military 
aviation training (?fields) and has revised 27 military routes 
for civil aviation purposes. As a result, no air accidents due 
to inadequate aviation control have been reported for several 
decades.

  [Text] Beijing, February 19 (CNS)--China's State 
Information Centre has issued its economic forecast in the first 
quarter of this year. 
  The industrial increase will remain the same as in the last 
quarter. The industrial output value of township level and 
above will increase by 22 percent over the same quarter of last 
year, but will be the same as for the last quarter of last year. 
Light industry will continue its increase and remain three 
percentage points up over heavy industry. 
  The increase in fixed assets investment will slow down and 
infrastructural construction investment by state-owned 
enterprises will increase by 36 percent while technological 
renovation investment will be 40 percent up. Both, however, 
will be down compared with last year. 
  There will be a slowing down in money supply, but currency 
in 
circulation will recover its increase. Various loans will 
increase by 22 percent over the same period of last year and 
currency in circulation will be 25.4 percent up. 
  The adverse balance of foreign trade will be improved with 
exports expoected to be 18 percent greater than in the same 
period of last year while imports are expected to be 21 percent 
up. The difference between exports and imports will fall to 
three percentage points from 14 percentage points for the first 
quarter in previous years. [sentence as received] 
  Based on the above forecast, the State Information Centre 
has 
proposed keeping the emphasis on macro-level control. The too 
rapid increase in investment should be controlled before the 
estalishment of a self-control system for investment. 
Speculative capital should be carefully controlled and 
restricted. A variety of economic reform measures being newly 
implemented should be gradually improved and coordination 
strengthened. While disparities between people's earning power 
remain, fairness in the distribution of wealth and the raising 
of living standards of lower-income earners will need to have 
close attention paid to it. The establishment of the social 
security system should be speeded up and the income of retired 
and unemployed people should be guaranteed.

<F P=106> ["Economic Jottings" by Li Ren (4539 0086): "Make Great </F>
Efforts To Encourage a Practical and Realistic Style"] 
  [Text] In the past, we suffered many times from the 
widespread practice of boasting and exaggeration, so we took 
every care not to allow the re-emergence of this tendency that 
harmed the country and the people. It is no easy job, however, 
to truly put an end to this tendency. In these years -- though 
the central authorities have made repeated injunctions demanding 
cadres at all levels be practical and realistic and have 
vigorously encouraged a realistic style -- boastfulness and 
exaggeration have remained, despite prohibitions over a long 
period of time, and have shown themselves to be quite serious in 
some places. 
  Some people are suspicious of the economic figures submitted 
to higher authorities by certain localities. This suspicion is 
not unfounded, nor is this because the figures are too high. If 
high figures have substance and show good cost-effectiveness, 
they are acceptable. The problem, however, lies in the source 
of the figures and how they are computed. I was told by private 
sources that the statistics in some localities are obtained by 
way of top-down breakdown, which means some very high economic 
targets are set at the beginning of a year and are broken down 
and assigned to subordinate units or areas, which, at the end of 
the year, are to submit to the higher authorities figures that 
are somewhat higher than the targets. If the targets are too 
high and beyond reach, and really are impossible to achieve with 
available resources, they will puff themselves up and make sure 
that the figures submitted are always higher than the targets. 
And this is not the worst. What is more outrageous is that 
some authorities bide their time and watch their neighbors 
toward the end of a year. When others have submitted their 
figures, they hold a meeting to set a figure that is higher than 
others'. If this figure is unrealistic, it will be broken down 
and assigned to subordinate units until the desired amount is 
made up. 
  Naturally, this phenomenon is not the mainstream. Since the 
reform and opening up began, seeking truth from facts has 
prevailed in all respects of our life. Nevertheless, we have to 
pay serious attention to nonprevailing problems; not only can 
such bogus figures seriously undermine the normal operation of 
our economy, they also can make it difficult for us to correctly 
assess and grasp our economic development. Furthermore, once it 
develops into a common practice, it will poison society 
tremendously. The lessons of history should remain fresh in our 
memories. 
  Spiraling emulation is one of the direct causes of the 
propensity to boast and exaggerate. If your "achievements" are 
great, mine are greater; no matter how much your figures have 
grown, mine have to exceed yours. We do encourage ambition and 
the spirit of not acknowledging defeat, but we should compare 
only genuine figures, not false ones. Some comrades ignore the 
subjective and objective conditions of their localities and try 
to compare with others by way of making up figures. They may 
receive "honor" and even a promotion as a result, but the masses 
definitely will suffer and the cause will be undermined. 
  Leaders must take the lead in eliminating boastfulness and 
exaggeration. It is of vital importance how the criteria for 
appraising cadres are set. A jingle circulating among the 
masses in some places says that those who seek truth from facts 
are criticized, while those who make false statistical reports 
get generous awards and promotions. What those above are fond 
of, those below will be addicted to. Therefore, cadres at all 
levels must set an example.

<F P=106> [By Qu Yingpu: "Capital Spending Keeps Output Rolling"] </F>
  [Text] China's industrial growth quickened in December as 
investment continued to soar. 
  The expansion, 29.8 percent over December 1992, was 10.9 
percent higher than the November rise. 
  Figures from the State Statistics Bureau show that national 
industrial output last year hit 3,507.39 billion yuan ($403.15 
billion) in 1990 constant prices, up 23.6 percent over 1992. 
  Capital investment last year was still huge, helping to 
propel the industrial growth. 
  A report from the bureau indicated that spending on capital 
construction in State-run industries jumped 54.2 percent over 
1992 to 464.69 billion yuan ($53.41 billion ). 
  Of this expenditure, 186.5 billion yuan ($21.44 billion) 
went 
to projects under the administration of the central government, 
an increase of 39 percent. The remainder, 278.19 billion yuan 
($31.98 billion), went to enterprises under the control of local 
authorities, a rise of 66.5 percent. 
  Manufacturing projects absorbed 319.98 billion yuan ($36.78 
billion), an increase of 51.1 percent. 
  Non-manufacturing investment totalled 144.71 billion yuan 
($16.63 billion), up 61.7 percent of which housing accounted for 
50.39 billion yuan ($5.79 billion), up 54 percent. 
  Money spent on technical renovation in State-run industries 
hit 219.25 billion yuan ($25.2 billion) up 50.1 percent. 
  In industrial production, light industry's output jumped 
22.3 
percent to 1,659.48 billion yuan ($190.74 billion) while heavy 
industry's gained 24.8 percent to 1,847.91 billion yuan ($212.4 
billion). 
  In 1993, State-run industries generated 1,830.71 billion 
yuan 
($210.43 billion) worth of products, 8.9 percent more than in 
1992, while collectively-owned enterprises chalked up an 
increase of 39.8 percent to 1,279.56 billion yuan ($147.08 
billion). Of the total output of collectively-owned firms, 
791.07 billion yuan ($90.93 billion) was generated by plants in 
rural areas, up 57.6 percent. 
  Foreign-funded enterprises and private firms reported 1993 
output of 397.12 billion yuan ($45.65 billion), a hefty increase 
of 64.4 percent. 
  However, the bureau said energy production edged ahead only 
4.3 percent to 1.103 billion tons of standard coal equivalent. 
  Production of undressed coal climbed 4.2 percent to 1.14 
billion tons, while production of crude oil grew 2.2 percent to 
1.45 billion tons. 
  Natural gas production inched up 6.8 percent to 16.56 
billion 
cubic metres, and production of hydro-electric power grew 12.3 
percent to 146 billion kilowatt-hours. 
  A close look at other products shows that with few 
exceptions, production increased in 1993 (See table).

<F P=106> [By Ma Zhiping: "Business in Free Markets Rises 50 Percent"] </F>
  [Text] The business volume in China's teeming free markets 
jumped 50 percent last year, according to official sources. 
  And sales at the markets accounted for 28 percent of the 
nation's gross retail business volume in 1993. 
  The number of free markets in China increased to 83,001 last 
year from 78,000 in 1992 with the support of 21.7 billion yuan 
($2.4 billion) in investment. 
  These statistics were provided by the State Administration 
for Industry and Commerce, which oversees the country's market 
development. 
  Business volume at the markets hit 534.3 billion yuan ($61.4 
billion), a 50 percent increase over 1992. 
  Free markets, which first appeared in the 1950s as a place 
where farmers could sell their produce to city residents, were 
banned in later years for "capitalist" characteristics. 
  They re-emerged with the rural reform in the late 1970s. 
  They have since prospered following nationwide market 
reform, 
becoming the major source of vegetables and handicraft products 
for consumers across China. 
  According to an administration official, free markets are 
divided into four categories -- comprehensive markets, ones for 
light industrial products, ones for agricultural products and 
by-products and special markets for such items as pets or 
flowers. 
  By the end of 1978, China had 33.300 free markets. Their 
business transactions that year totalled only 1.25 billion yuan 
($143 million), 5.4 per cent of the country's retail sales. 
  Although only 16,450 free markets are located in cities, 
they 
play a major role in supplying vegetables and other daily 
necessities to residents. 
  "The development of free markets, especially in the last 
three years, has considerably eased the shortage of vegetables 
in some Chinese cities," the official said. 
  And today free markets are no longer the traditional ones 
dominated by farmers but a big market place shared by both State 
enterprises, collectively-run businesses and private 
businessmen," he added. Such markets sell not only daily 
necessities but also industrial materials and products, the 
official said. 
  Vegetable sales at free markets totalled 58.2 billion yuan 
($6.68 billion) last year, a 33 percent rise over 1992. The 
sales volume was about eight times that of State-owned vegetable 
suppliers. 
  Last year's grain transactions at free markets also grew a 
record 70 percent, with business volume reaching 22.67 billion 
yuan ($2.6 billion). Sales of meat, livestock and eggs rose to 
110.3 billion yuan ($12.6 bilion), a 28 percent increase over 
1992. 
  More than 474,000 people are engaged in transporting goods 
and products to free markets. And it is estimated that 1.06 
million motor vehicles and 83,000 ships are used in transporting 
goods. 
  In addition to food and merchandise markets, 4,000 markets 
supplying production materials and 1,700 labour markets, real 
estate and technical exchange have also emerged: State-owned 
enterprises still control the sale of raw materials such as 
steel, iron, petroleum and timber. 
  In eastern Zhejiang Province, which has been leading the 
country in free market development in recent years, new progress 
was made last year. 
  It has 107 markets, each of whose annual sales exceed 100 
million yuan ($11.5 million). Its Yiwu Small Industrial 
Articles Market, the country's biggest free market, did a record 
4.5 billion yuan ($517 million) in sales last year.

<F P=106> [By Kan San: "Sichuan Lays Down Rules for New Shares] </F>
  [Text] Sichuan Province has adopted regulations designed 
to ensure openness and fairness in deciding which companies will 
be authorized to issue shares publicly this year. 
  The regulations permit every city in the province to 
recommend one local enterprise to the provincial government. 
  Then the provincial commission on economic restructuring 
will 
organize lawyers and accountants to investigate the businesses. 
  Their reports will be sent to the provincial securities 
regulatory commission. 
  Then the provincial securities policy committee will select 
the companies by secret ballot. 
  The provincial government said the chosen firms will be 
mainly in the energy, transport, and raw materials industries. 
  They should be able to prove they have had a satisfactory 
business record for three consecutive years and have violated no 
laws in that period. 
  Each firm's net assets should exceed 30 million yuan ($3.5 
million). 
  The foundation for a sound equity market in Sichuan was laid 
last year, and a securities network centred in the capital 
Chengdu and in Chongqing now includes more than 10 cities. 
  By the end of last year, 50 Sichuan companies had issued 
shares publicly and 14 of them had been listed on the Shanghai 
and Shenzhen securities exchanges. 
  The province has setup five securities companies and many 
others based in Shanghai or Shenzhen have opened branches in 
Chengdu and Chongqing. 
  Across the province, 407 outlets allow investors to trade 
shares listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen. 
  More than 100,000 people in Sichuan have traded in stocks 
with a transaction value of 20 billion yuan ($2.3 billion). 
  The province has invested 2 million yuan ($230,000) to set 
up 
the Sichuan Securities Trading Centre, which has a 
700-square-metre trading floor and more than 200 seats, in 
Chengdu. 
  The centre lists 20 kinds of treasury and corporate bonds 
with a value of 700 million yuan ($80 million). A computer 
link-up with the Shanghai and Shenzhen securities exchanges is 
expected this year.

<F P=106> [By Jin Ye: "For The First Time, Intangible Assets Are </F>
Appraised"] 
  [Text] The valuation of intangible assets, a new facet of 
Chinese assets appraisal, has passed a milestone with the first 
formal publication of an appraiser's findings. 
  Beijing Jiacheng Assets Appraisal Co Ltd disclosed its 
appraisal of the intangible assets of five enterprises early 
last month. 
  They are name recognition of the Great Wall Sheraton Hotel 
Beijing, worth 264 million yuan ($30 million); of Hong Kong 
Yizhou Ltd's mainland branch, 213 million yuan ($24.5 million), 
of Beijing Ye Guangbei Distillery, 54 million yuan ($6.2 million 
), of Hainan Airline Co 203 million yuan ($23 million); and 
Hainan Pisk International Airline and Tourist Club, 107 million 
yuan ($12 million). 
  Name recognition is a measure of an enterprise's ability to 
profit from the popularity of its name or the trademark of its 
products. Other intangible assets are copyrights, patents, 
service symbols, software, management systems and permission to 
make a product. 
  "Our work aims to popularize the concept of intangible 
assets," said Zhu Sheng, managing director of Beijing Jiacheng 
Assets Appraisal. "Now, many Chinese are still blind to the 
value of intangible assets, which hinders the development of 
China's market economy. 
  Neglecting to appraise intangible assets may result in loss 
of valuable fixed assets, Zhu said. 
  For instance, while co-operating with foreign investors many 
Chinese enterprises fail to calculate the value of intangible 
assets. And an inexact appraisal of intangible assets could 
lead to losses as enterprises shift to shareholding companies. 
  At the same time, appraisals may help reduce the number of 
trademark infringement cases by fixing a trademark's value. 
  Underestimating trademark value is a major problem in 
current 
appraisals of intangible assets, Zhu added. 
  A famous trademark like Tsingtao beer is valued at only 200 
million yuan ($23 million) and Fenjiu is worth 30 million yuan 
($3.5 million). 
  In comparison, the trademark value of the immensely popular 
Marlboro cigarettes exceeds $31 billion, twice the brand's 
annual sales. And for Coca-Cola it is $24.4 billion, compared 
with annual sales of $8.4 billion. 
  "It is a pity that China is not represented on the list of 
the world's top 10 famous trademarks, although it has many 
high-quality products bearing nationally famous trademarks," Zhu 
said. 
  "One goal of China's intangible assets appraisal is to 
establish the concept among people that trademarks may mean 
much, as well as to help its own famous trademarks tap the 
world's market."

<F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Amid Holiday Cheer, an Alarm Bell Over </F>
Inflation"] 
  [Text] As free-spending Spring Festival shoppers buoy up 
China's consumer market, the spectre of inflation is casting its 
gloomy shadow over the holiday festivities. 
  In this month of China's most important holiday, consumers' 
strong buying mood is exerting severe pressure on the 
government's effort to control inflation, said Wang Shiyuan, 
Vice-Minister of the State Commission for Economic Restructuring. 
  However, Wang noted, "I am still confident that the 
government will attain its goal of containing inflation within 
10 percent this year." 
  Despite Wang's confidence, the State Statistics Bureau 
reported that in December inflation in the 35 largest cities 
rose to a record 23.9 percent. 
  Some Beijingers doubted the government would be able to cap 
inflation at 10 percent. 
  One resident, Li An, said the government's latest financial 
reforms--including the unified exchange rate, the consumption 
tax and the new accounting system--might undercut effective 
control over the rising cost of living. 
  Wang Shiyuan said the government has foreseen possible 
side-effects of its reform and will take measures to keep 
inflation at bay. 
  The most important step in easing inflationary pressures is 
to ensure a general balance between supply and demand of goods, 
he added. 
  The government also intends to restrain economic expansion 
this year by keeping growth in the gross domestic product to 9 
percent. 
  In addition. it will strictly supervise bank lending for 
investment in fixed assets. 
  Wang said several factors pose a threat to the government's 
efforts to control inflation: 
  --Production costs for industry and agriculture have risen 
over the past few years as a result of government price 
increases for various production materials. 
  --Last year's 19.6 percent rise in the national cost of 
living has already created conditions that hamper the 
government's campaign against inflation. 
  --Apart from unifying the dual-rate exchange system, which 
effectively raises the cost of imports, the government also 
plans to deregulate the prices of other product some time this 
year. 
  Increased financing during the fourth quarter of last year 
to 
stimulate industrial production has had a notable impact on 
production, but also on inflation, Wang added.

<F P=106> [Article by Tien Kuang-ying (3944 0342 5391): "China To </F>
Stop Granting Preferential Policies to Coastal Areas"] 
  [Text] This year, China will change its previous practice 
of granting more favorable policies to coastal areas. Policies 
related to taxation, import and export trade, customs tariffs, 
and the use of foreign capital will be slanted in terms of trade 
sector. This was recently decided at an important meeting in 
Beijing. 
  Up to now, the Chinese Government has granted a series of 
favorable policies to coastal areas, thus enabling these areas 
to become prosperous ahead of others. By benefiting from the 
favorable policies, the coastal areas have effected 
unprecedented economic growth. In particular, the coastal areas 
of Guangdong have achieved enviable economic development as they 
have benefited from favorable policies and being adjacent to 
Hong Kong. 
  The new policy decision of the Chinese Government will 
terminate the overall policy structure which was favorable to 
the coastal areas and resulted in a widening the gap between 
different areas, and this is related to the increasing 
discontent in society. 
  In recent years, many people have criticized the practice of 
giving more favorable policies to some areas. They pointed out 
that during the period of reform and opening up, substantial 
economic development in the coastal areas, especially the 
coastal areas of Guangdong, was not a result of their own 
efforts to a great degree, but was gained at the expense of the 
interior's development. The special and favorable policies the 
central government adopted for the coastal areas have had some 
negative effects. 
  The manpower and material resources of the interior have 
been 
continuously flowing to Guangdong and other coastal areas at low 
prices. As time goes on, the poor will become poorer while the 
rich get richer. As various localities have to hand over 
similar amounts of tax revenue and profits to the state, the 
coastal areas can keep more funds in their own hands, and this 
is extremely unfair. A scholar revealed in an article that, for 
a time, funds flowing to Shenzhen accounted for one-third of the 
country's total working capital. The slanted policies might 
have created a false impression of prosperity, but this was not 
something one should be proud of because it was just an abnormal 
situation. 
  In the interior provinces and regions, people, from 
government officials to ordinary people, are discontented with 
the biased policies favorable to the coastal areas. If such a 
situation continues, it will certainly bring about certain 
serious social problems nationwide. The termination of the 
policy structure favorable to the coastal areas, to a great 
degree, is aimed at preventing social unrest rather than meeting 
the needs of economic development. 
  On the other hand, the Chinese Government has also now 
decided to stop the practice of giving favorable treatment to 
the coastal areas because it fears that some local forces might 
strengthen excessively. For example, in the past 10 years or 
more of reform and opening, Guangdong's local economic strength 
has increased substantially and people there have become rather 
arrogant on the basis of their wealth. Their practice of 
"making full use of the policies" and "daring to jump red 
lights" has also startled people in other parts of the country. 
If it is allowed to continue to enjoy favorable policy 
treatment, it is doubtful whether the central government will 
still be able to control the province effectively. When they 
made the favorable policy arrangements, the central authorities 
hoped that economic growth in the coastal areas would bring 
common development to other areas. Now, in discovering this 
tendency to go beyond their control, it is certain that the 
first thing they should do is to check such a tendency. 
  However, the change in the policy structure tilted in favor 
of certain areas to a policy structure tilted in favor of 
certain industries also shows that the government has become 
more mature in guiding economic development. In the vast 
territory of China, excessive imbalances between different areas 
will inevitably cause great obstructions to economic development 
rather than promoting economic development. The improper 
industrial structure will eventually cause economic growth to 
lack momentum. 
  In the past, Hong Kong people's investments were mainly 
concentrated in Guangdong and other coastal areas, and such 
investments yielded handsome returns. This year, China's 
economic reform will undergo another major turning point, and 
the scope of foreign investment will be extended to commerce, 
banking, insurance, and shipping industries, and no restraint 
will be imposed on the scale and technological level of foreign 
investment projects. The industrial tilt will become a major 
characteristic of macroeconomic guidance policies. It can be 
said that, this year, in order to achieve better results in 
investment in China, Hong Kong investors should first give 
consideration to the impact of the guiding policies the Chinese 
Government has adopted.

  [Text] Beijing, February 20 (XINHUA correspondent Zhang 
Chengzhi) [dateline as received] -- To his total disappointment, 
through the entire morning Zhang Guoquan found only ten people 
coming to him to apply for jobs at a major subsidiary of the 
state-run Capital Iron and Steel Company in Beijing. 
  Zhang, an official in the personnel section of the No. 1 
steel-rolling plant under the company, began hiring new workers 
at the western district labor placement center on February 18. 
  "My plant plans to hire 100 new workers this year, as many 
as 
in 1993. We spent all of 1993 hiring these 100 people," he said. 
  Gone are the days when his plant was a popular workplace for 
young people, although it still offers high pay and fringe 
benefits, he said. 
  In the same center, however, a Beijing-based bicycle store 
found 20 people applying in the same morning for five jobs it is 
offering. 
  The store sells bikes built by the Zhonghua Bicycle (group) 
Company in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, with annual sales 
reaching 35 million yuan. 
  Some 100 businesses open hiring stands in the center on 
Wednesday and Friday mornings, receiving more than 2,000 
job-seekers. 
  Wang Zhenliang, manager of the center, said, "With the 
two-way choice available, the competition between employers and 
job-seekers is becoming increasingly fierce." 
  Using computerized information, the center serves as a 
go-between for employers and prospective employees, he said. 
  To date, Beijing has set up 63 job placement agencies like 
the western district center. Seeking jobs in these agencies are 
young people, workers from bankrupt companies, workers in 
state-owned enterprises who want to move to better-paying 
companies, retirees and farmers. 
  An official from the Chinese Labor Ministry said that 
China's 
labor system is undergoing a "sweeping change" as a result of 
the establishment and improvement of labor markets. 
  The change is characterized primarily by the abandonment of 
job assignment by the government and a two-way choice between 
employers and job-seekers, he said. 
  Zhao Zhiqiang, chief of the labor market section of the 
ministry, described the establishment of labor markets as an 
"important link" in establishing a market economic structure in 
China. 
  "The establishment of labor markets requires the reform of 
the distribution system in enterprises and the establishment of 
a social security system," he said. 
  These markets include job placement agencies, job training 
centers and unemployment insurance companies, he said. 
  According to Zhao, 15,000 job placement agencies in major 
cities and rural townships provide jobs for eight million people 
a year. 
  China currently has 2,100 unemployment insurance companies 
providing services to 73 million workers and 200,000 labor 
service companies employing a total of nine million people. 
  Economists in Beijing agreed that labor markets are still in 
the making in China because enterprises have not been granted 
the authority to fire workers and set wages according to 
workers' performance. 
  The Chinese Government plans to carry out a series of new 
reforms in the near future, in an effort to cultivate labor 
markets, one economist said. 
  These will include measures to enable non-state-owned 
businesses to set wages through management-labor negotiations 
and to permit state-run companies to set performance-based wages. 
  Furthermore, the government will also set minimum wages as a 
measure to regulate distribution and grant state-run enterprises 
the authority to decide on how many people they need to employ, 
he said.

  [Text] Beijing, February 19 (XINHUA) -- China's nonferrous 
industry increased its productivity by 11 percent in 1993, a 
business executive said here today. 
  Addressing a national work conference, Fei Ziwen, general 
manager of the China National Nonferrous Metals Industry 
Corporation, said that China's output of ten types of major 
nonferrous metals reached 3.27 million tons last year, meeting 
the 1995 target two years ahead of schedule. 
  "Meanwhile, our corporation has also made great progress in 
improving productivity by transferring a number of workers to 
the service sector and other lines of production," Fei told 
managers of nonferrous metals companies across the country. 
  By doing so, companies attached to the corporation cut their 
total workforce by 12 percent in 1993, or 90,000 people, he said. 
  He said that his corporation will continue to do so until 
the 
end of the century. It plans to transfer another 10 percent of 
the workforce to other production lines in 1994 and 33 percent 
by 2000, he added. 
  "China's nonferrous industry is still far behind its 
colleagues in developed countries in terms of productivity," he 
conceded. 
  Although the country's present nonferrous metals production 
is 11 times the amount in the 1950s, the productivity of the 
industry rose by just 100 percent, he said. 
  He described the 11 percent rise in the industry's 
productivity in 1993 as a "significant achievement." 
  "Only by continuing to improve its productivity, will 
China's 
nonferrous industry become more competitive in the world 
market," he said.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Wang Yong: "Swap Markets To Be Replaced </F>
in April"] 
  [Text] The reform of China's foreign exchange control 
system will be in full swing soon, which will ease the pooling 
of enterprise financial resources. 
  Officials from the State Administration of Exchange Control 
said yesterday that a national inter-bank foreign exchange 
trading system was expected to be established around April, 
replacing the old swap markets. 
  They spoke at a seminar in Beijing organized by the China 
Association of Enterprises with Foreign Investment. 
  In general, enterprises will find it easier to obtain 
foreign 
exchange by going directly to banks instead of swap markets, 
which have been based on the two-tiered foreign exchange rate 
mechanism. 
  China unified foreign exchange rates in January at $1 to 8.7 
yuan. 
  The impending inter-bank markets will use the single-rate 
system. 
  Seven such markets will be established on a trial basis 
toward the end of this month, the officials said. 
  But they did not say where the experimental markets would be 
located. 
  "Enterprises, including those with foreign investment, will 
find it easier to exchange between foreign currencies and the 
renminbi yuan via banks," an official said. 
  For example, a newly-formed joint venture with foreign 
investment can buy foreign currencies directly from banks if it 
is approved by the State Administration of Exchange Control to 
do so. 
  The approval yardstick is that the venture must be engaged 
in 
projects encouraged by the State Planning Committee, such as 
power stations, railways and wharfs. 
  The bulk of these ventures' income will be in renminbi. 
  Also, foreign-invested leasing companies are allowed to 
settle their business in foreign currencies, as an exception to 
China's latest regulation ruling out such settlement starting 
this year. 
  One official said the leasing companies can sign payment 
contracts with domestic clients in foreign currencies to avert 
possible losses from the fluctuation of foreign exchange rates. 
  China's leasing companies have complained in recent years 
that limited access to foreign currencies has hurt their 
business. 
  The officials also elaborated on new regulations that would 
govern opening banking accounts and the capital movement of 
foreign investment enterprises. 
  China will restrict such enterprises from remitting their 
dividends and bonuses overseas if they fail to put in their 
share of registered capital on time. 
  The action is in light of the continuous downward spiral of 
the actual input of foreign capital over the past few years. 
  The actual input has accounted for less than 20 percent of 
what was promised by foreign investors last year. 
  The figure compares to around 60 percent about a decade ago. 
  The officials also said that foreign investment enterprises 
would be free to open banking accounts where they are located, 
provided they have registered with the State Administration of 
Exchange Control. 
  But they would face stricter inspection when it comes to 
opening accounts in the other parts of China and overseas.
