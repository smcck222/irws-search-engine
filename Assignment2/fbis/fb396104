<F P=106> [By Xu Yang: "New Move to Boost Unions"] </F>
  [Text] The All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) 
has vowed to organize workers in over half of the country's 
foreign-funded enterprises before the end of the year. 
  The push comes at a time when unions are becoming 
increasingly important in resolving labour disputes in such 
firms, ACFTU officials said. 
  Statistics show that only 4,200 foreign-funded firms, less 
than 10 per cent in China, had unions by the end of 1992. 
  But according to Tian Yukun, an ACFTU official, the figure 
may have reached 10,000 by the end of last year, or 25 to 30 per 
cent of the total since many joint ventures are partly funded by 
State-owned enterprises that already have trade unions. 
  Provinces like Jiangsu and Liaoning saw union coverage 
expand 
to 50 per cent of their foreign-funded firms last year. 
  Over the past few years, the foreign investment boom has 
given rise to more labour disputes in foreign-funded firms. 
  A report in the Chinese Management News said there have been 
250,000 labour disputes and strikes since 1988, mostly in joint 
ventures. Tian emphasized that most disputes occurred in firms 
without trade unions. 
  Disputes usually centre on ambiguous contracts, work hours, 
low pay, and poor worker safety conditions. 
  Contracts at many factories fail to meet state labour rules. 
  In some cases, two copies of contracts were prepared, one in 
Chinese and another in English, each containing different terms. 
Many workers have been misled by their contracts, union 
officials said. 
  In many firms, workers work twelve-hour days and do not get 
holidays or Sundays off. 
  Last year, workers in a Guangzhou foreign-funded factory 
resorted to striking when they were forced to work two months 
without a day of rest. 
  Severe negligence of worker safety is another problem. 
  Last year, 27 of the 200 employees in the Shenzhen Hongda 
Hardware Factory lost their fingers because of unsafe machinery. 
For some of the victims, it was their first day of work. 
  With all these problems, Tian said labour disputes are 
inevitable. 
  "But we do not advocate strikes since they hurt both the 
factory and workers," he said. 
  Unions can help resolve problems before extreme measures 
like 
strikes are sought. 
  According to the Trade Union Law passed last year, unions 
are 
required to have a seat on the boards of enterprises so they can 
express worker complaints. 
  Unions also help to increase factory productivity by 
organizing training programmes and assisting workers. 
  "Our tasks in foreign-invested enterprises are first to 
implement the opening up policy and second, to safeguard 
workers' legitimate rights," Tian said.

  [Text] Beijing, February 20 (XINHUA) -- Dick Liu, president 
of the Du Pont China Company, will no longer have to worry about 
China's dual-track foreign exchange rates, because China unified 
them at the very beginning of the year. 
  The unification has provided a warranty for overseas 
businesses in China such as Du Pont, according to Liu. 
  Last year, the rising market foreign exchange rate left the 
prices of his company's raw material imports increasing greatly 
and production costs going up apace, which affected the firm's 
profits. 
  Now, he said, the unified exchange rate assured the normal 
production and import and export business of the foreign-funded 
companies in China. 
  The reform of the management system of foreign exchange is 
one aspect of China's reform package this year. Since the 
reforms, covering the fields of foreign exchange, taxation, 
finance, state planning, investment and foreign trade, will have 
a great impact on foreign-funded companies and banks in China, 
all foreign entrepreneurs and bankers attach great importance to 
their implementation. 
  With this in mind, XINHUA reporters arranged interviews with 
chief representatives of the Beijing offices of 20 foreign 
companies and banks, as well as foreign managers of 
foreign-funded enterprises. 
  During the interviews, they all agreed that the reform is 
one 
of the most decisive steps China has taken in adjusting its 
economy to conform to international economic norms. The reform 
will attract more foreign capital into China, they say. 
  Klaus Kaltenthaler, chief representative of Germany's BASF 
Chemical Corporation's Beijing office, said that in order to 
develop a market economy connected with the world economy as a 
whole, China must establish economic structures similar to 
well-accepted models in most parts of the world. 
  The success of the reform will give China more opportunities 
to conduct economic cooperation with foreign countries, he said. 
  Sander Tideman, chief representative of the Netherlands' 
Abn-Amro Bank Beijing office, said that the reforms, especially 
those on the management system of foreign exchange and taxation 
system, were "far-reaching" in importance. 
  "Although some foreigners will adopt a `wait and see' 
attitude toward the complicated reforms, the majority of 
investors felt encouraged and more confident in investing in 
China," he added. 
  Touching on the reform of China's foreign exchange system, 
the chief representative of the Beijing office of the Mitsubishi 
Trust and Banking Corporation, Takeshi Kagami, said that it is 
more convenient for his business after the unification of 
China's dual-track foreign exchange rates. 
  "It is very difficult to explain the dual-track exchange 
rates to our associates, while things have become easy and clear 
now," said the banker. 
  The overseas businessmen all believed that dual-track 
exchange rates were confusing and imposed disadvantages on their 
interests in China. 
  When talking about reform of the taxation system, U. 
Buchmann, chief representative of the Beijing office of the 
Swiss Credit Bank, said that a healthy taxation system can 
ensure a country's revenue and the smooth development of the 
country's economy. For instance, China needs a huge amount of 
capital to develop its infrastructure and social insurance 
system. 
  Since the beginning of this year, China started to levy 
value-added tax, consumption tax and business tax from overseas 
businesses in China, instead of the former consolidated 
industrial and commercial tax, and this will create a fair 
taxation environment for overseas business people. 
  Evan Papadopoulos, general manager of the Beijing Concord 
Store, expressed his satisfaction with the tax reform, noting 
that the reform enables China's taxation system to come nearer 
to international practice, without putting much burden on retail 
companies. 
  These business people stated their understanding of some 
problems in the process of such reforms, saying that the reforms 
will be successful as long as the Chinese Government pays 
attention to the problems and resolves them well.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "No Disruptions Seen in Flow of Foreign </F>
Capital"] 
  [Text] A senior trade expert associated with the central 
government is optimistic that foreign capital will continue to 
flow into China this year despite the contraction in real estate 
business. 
  Although the property boom has been muffled by the 
government 
clampdown on credit, other opportunities may compensate for the 
loss. 
  "Foreign investors are expected to have a foothold in 
certain 
new sectors like agriculture and banking, while bringing about 
larger-scale projects," said Li Yue, Vice Chairman and 
Secretary-General of the China Association of Enterprises with 
Foreign Investment. 
  The association is under the leadership of the Ministry of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec), and helps 
advise the ministry on policy-making. 
  Li said construction of major infrastructure projects will 
remain constant through the year. 
  For instance, Li said, many giant international companies 
want to set up joint ventures making power equipment. 
  "China is the world's largest market for power 
construction," 
he said. "but the quality of domestically-manufactured power 
equipment leaves much to be desired." 
  Li added that metallurgy, too, will need more foreign 
investment as domestic consumption expands along with the 
economy. 
  The automobile spare parts industry is another magnet for 
foreign investment, as China will raise production of 
automobiles this year. 
  For example, Shanghai Volkswagen, a Sino-German joint 
venture 
which turned out 100,000 cars last year, is expected to increase 
production by 50,000 in 1994. 
  "The production of raw materials and basic machinery and 
electronic components is lucrative, too," Li said. 
  He cited General Electric Co (GE) and the Shell Co as big 
businesses poised to invest in China. GE and Shell would like 
to produce engineering plastics and other chemical products in 
China. 
  Aside from infrastructure, Li said, agriculture and the 
service sector are also expected to benefit from more foreign 
investment. 
  He expressed hope that the State will give more favourable 
treatment to foreign investors when it comes to high-risk 
sectors like agriculture. 
  The State now monopolizes export of agricultural products, 
but Li thinks foreign investors should be permitted a role. 
  "The current monopoly, which fails to promote the quality of 
agricultural and sideline products, has caused our share of the 
Hong Kong market to shrink," he pointed out. 
  Li said that if an approaching national working conference 
on 
the use of foreign investment proposes new policies regarding 
agriculture, the prospects for more foreign capital will 
brighten. He did not mention when the conference will be held. 
  Li also suggested relaxing controls on how the service 
sector 
uses foreign investment, especially in regard to finance and 
telecommunications. 
  For example, foreign banks now can open branches only in the 
coastal regions. But Li said foreign banks should be allowed to 
open branches inland on a trial basis to expand investment, 
especially for mining. 
  "Moreover," Li said, "China should permit foreign banks to 
deal in renminbi business if it wants to enhance the yuan's 
credibility among international financial institutions." 
  This way, he said, the renminbi could be helped on its way 
to 
becoming a freely convertible currency. 
  On another subject, Li said the China Association of 
Enterprises with Foreign Investment will help address a number 
of major problems plaguing foreign investment ventures. 
  Among these problems are the large number of enterprises 
that 
lose money, the slow flow of foreign capital, and growing 
disputes between foreign managers and Chinese employees. 
  Because his association has many joint ventures as members, 
it can help foreign investors find Chinese partners, and vice 
versa. 
  Li added, "We will also help certain enterprises involved in 
anti-dumping cases to prepare for lawsuits this year."

  [Text] Beijing, February 20 (XINHUA) -- The State Council, 
China's Central Government, is to publish this year a set of 
regulations that will allow foreign investment in China's mining 
sector, XINHUA learned from the Ministry of Geology and Mineral 
resources today. 
  The regulations, expected to become effective on 
publication, 
will encourage foreign companies and individuals to invest in 
prospecting and mining China's mineral resources independently 
or through joint venture or cooperative projects, a ranking 
official said. 
  The official said that the regulations "explicitly state the 
rights and responsibilities of foreign investors as well as the 
preferential treatment they are to receive for their investment." 
  In drafting the regulations, he added, officials and experts 
at the ministry have also seen to it that they will be easy to 
apply. 
  Over the years, many foreign companies have sent people to 
China to probe the possibility of investing in China's mining 
sector. But, said the official, "for lack of legislation, the 
sector has been behind other sectors in opening to the outside 
world." 
  He noted that the "Law on Mineral Resources of the People's 
Republic of China," effective since 1986, contains no clause on 
foreign investment in the country's mining sector. 
  The law has played a big role in promoting the development 
of 
the sector. But "it was formulated under the planned economy 
and some of its clauses are obviously obsolete and therefore 
need to be revised," the official said. 
  The National People's Congress has included revisions of 
these clauses in the "mineral resources law" into its plans for 
legislation, the official disclosed. 
  The State Council, for its part, has approved a set of 
regulations on the collection of mineral resources compensation 
fees, which will be published soon. 
  The fees, explained the official, embody the rights of the 
nation to the ownership of the mineral resources and are meant 
to prevent undue mining. They will be used to cover part of the 
prospecting costs. 
  Until now, mineral resources have been extracted free of 
charge. "We have to do away with this legacy of the planned 
economy, which often causes waste," he said. 
  China depends on minerals for 95 percent of the energy and 
80 
percent of the industrial raw materials it needs. But its 
mineral resources are limited in relation to its vast 
population, the official pointed out.

  [Text] Beijing, Feb 20 (AFP)--Foreign-funded firms in 
Guangdong province are guilty of a range of employee abuses, 
from beating workers to denying female staff maternity leave, 
according to a trade union report published Sunday. The report 
on the findings of the provincial trade union organisation's 
investigation is the latest in a lengthy series of studies 
lambasting foreign-funded firms and joint ventures for their 
treatment of Chinese workers. 
  Some 18 percent of workers at the 20 firms investigated by 
the union in the southern Chinese province said they had been 
regularly beaten or insulted, the report published in 
International Business News said. Twenty-five percent had had 
their identification cards confiscated by the management, and 37 
percent had been threatened with the loss of their jobs for 
complaining. Forty percent had never signed a contract, the 
report said, adding that 61 percent of the workers put in a 
seven-day week, averaging eight to 10 working hours a day. 
  The investigation also found evidence to back up repeated 
allegations that foreign-funded firms put profits before safety 
as they rush to grab a slice of China's economic boom. Some 36 
percent of the workers had received no training in safety 
regulations, while 44 percent had no medical or industrial 
accident insurance. More than 10 percent of the 206 large-scale 
industrial fires in China last year involved foreign-funded 
firms. 
  Two fires within a month at the end of 1993 killed 80 
employees in a Hong Kong-funded toy factory in the southern 
special economic zone of Shenzhen and 64 workers in a 
Taiwan-funded textile plant in the eastern city of Fuzhou. Most 
of the victims were female factory workers. 
  The investigation found that 47 percent of the women workers 
were denied maternity leave, and any who failed to return to 
work soon after giving birth were automatically fired. 
  The union said its inquiry revealed a total disregard for 
Chinese laws and regulations, and it also blamed local 
authorities for failing to curb exploitation. Local labour 
rules in China follow general guidelines set by the central 
authorities and are often loosely implemented. 
  The eastern province of Shandong recently became the first 
Chinese province to publish its own set of regulations governing 
employment conditions in foreign-funded enterprises.

  [Text] Tianjin, February 19 (XINHUA) -- China's first 
Sino-foreign incorporated research institute, the 
Tianjin-Australia Building Materials Research Institute, was set 
up yesterday in Tianjin. 
  The pioneering institute was jointly sponsored by the 
Tianjin 
Building Materials Research Institute and the Building Research 
Center of the University of New South Wales in Australia. 
  Establishment of the institute marks the beginning of the 
adoption of a new way for Chinese scientific research 
institutions to cooperate with foreign partners. 
  The institute will also adapt to international practices in 
management and operation. 
  Instead of depending on government allocation of funds for 
research as do most other Chinese research institutes, it 
directly contacts relevant domestic and Australian enterprises 
to define research projects and seek financial support. 
  The institute has already been commissioned and financed by 
Australia's CSR Ltd, the Asia-Assistance Bureau of the 
Australian Government and the Science and Technology Commission 
of Tianjin municipal government for four research projects, 
including exploration of new building materials, technology of 
construction, quality management and construction costs. 
  According to Liang Su, chief of the Science and Technology 
Commission of Tianjin municipal government, establishment of 
such Sino-foreign research institutes will promote exchanges of 
domestic experts and research institutions with foreign 
counterparts and enable China to keep pace with foreign 
countries in technology research, production and marketing. 
  He also said that more Sino-foreign cooperating institutes 
will be set up in succession as part of the efforts to promote 
the reform of the country's scientific institutions. 
  The newly-founded institute has also facilitated the 
establishment on the same day of a Sino-Australian building 
materials company -- CSR Tianjin Ready Mix Ltd. 
  It was jointly funded by CSR Ltd of Australia and Tianjin 
Building Materials Supplies Corporation and has commissioned two 
research projects at the research institute.

  [Text] Hefei, February 19 (XINHUA) -- The abandoned sandy 
course of the Yellow River [Huang He], China's second longest, 
which frequently covered towns and villages nearby, has been 
transformed into a key farm production area. 
  Transiting Henan, Anhui and Jiangsu Provinces for more than 
700 kilometers, the farms on the former river course last year 
turned out a record 1.5 billion kilogram of fruit, 2.5 billion 
kilogram of vegetables, more than four million head of cattle 
and sheep, as well as quantities of grain, cotton and edible oil. 
  The area's farm products are sold to more than 20 provinces 
and municipalities in the country and Europe, America, 
South-East Asia and Japan. 
  The 5,464-kilometer-long Yellow River crosses the country 
from west to east and flows from Qinghai to Sichuan, Gansu, 
Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Shanxi and Henan and enters 
the Bohai Sea in Shandong. It is known as "the cradle of 
Chinese culture." 
  But the river was also notorious for its drought and flood 
disasters. 
  According to historical records, the river burst in Lankao 
County, Henan Province, in 1855, and flooded northwards into the 
Bohai Sea, abandoning the original river bed. 
  Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 
1949, 
local people have been mobilized to plant five tree belts with a 
total length of 520 kilometers along the river course and trees 
around farmland to improve ecological conditions. 
  As a result, the sand storm conditions have dropped from an 
average annual 17.8 days in the late 1950s to zero at present. 
  According to Wang Xinkong, a senior agronomist, China began 
an all-round development of the former Yellow River course in 
the early 1980s, when the Chinese Academy of Agricultural 
Sciences organized scientists to survey the course. 
  "The river course in the 34 degrees north latitude has 
clear-cut drought, humid, cold and warm climate in addition to 
abundant sunshine," Wang said. 
  "With the porous soil, it is suitable for growing apples, 
grapes, pears, walnuts and other fruit," he added. 
  Adopting the agro-scientists' suggestions, the Ministry of 
Agriculture started to encourage local people to expand areas 
planted with fruit orchards. 
  Through a decade of efforts, the formerly sandy river course 
has become a "green wall", or China's longest fruit tree belt, 
and farmers benefit from it. 
  A survey shows that the average annual income of farmers in 
the 20 counties of the former river course rose from 60 yuan per 
person in 1978 to 800 yuan last year. Farmers who grow more 
fruit trees have earned more. 
  Instead of living in mud-and-straw cottages, more and more 
farmers have moved into newly-built two-storey brick flats. 
  Many of them have got rid of their limited worn-out 
hand-woven and made clothes and bought all sorts of clothes: 
shorts and skirts for summer, down-filled clothes for winter and 
woollen sweaters for spring and autumn. 
  Even the meals at their tables have changed, from only sweet 
potatoes every day to flour and rice together with vegetables, 
meat and fish. 
  A survey shows that every household has bicycles, one-fifth 
of them own tractors, and some have motorcycles and even motor 
vehicles.

  [Text] Hefei, February 19 (XINHUA) -- Tens of thousands of 
surplus rural laborers in East China's Anhui Province are being 
sent to work in coastal areas in a planned way soon after the 
spring festival, the traditional Chinese New Year earlier this 
month. 
  One of China's agricultural areas, the economically backward 
Anhui Province has more than 12 million surplus rural laborers. 
  "To help these farmers find new jobs is one way to help lift 
them to a well-off life," said a provincial official in charge 
of rural economic development. 
  Encouraged by the provincial government, all village 
committees, local governments and labor service departments have 
singed contacts with enterprises and organizations outside the 
province before sending surplus laborers. 
  A survey shows that more than 500,000 rural people from the 
province worked across the country last year. Many of them had 
received technical training before going out to their new jobs.

River Delta to match that of neighbouring Hong Kong by the time 
China resumes sovereignty over the territory in 1997. 
  To this end, the authorities have decided to invest 8 
billion 
yuan ($920 million) in its post and telecommunication industry 
in 1994. 
  Of the investment, 2.5 billion yuan ($287 million) will be 
used to develop mobile telephones. Half of China's 840,000 
mobile telephone users live in Guangdong. 
  By the end of this year, Guangdong will have raised 
installed 
capacity by 400,000 lines. And the number of customers is 
expected to rise to 180,000, bringing the province's total to 
600,000. 
  Guangdong will also add 2.5 million telephone lines, 
including 100,000 for international direct dial (IDD) and 50,000 
in the countryside. To do this the province is installing 28 
cables connecting Guangzhou with Shantou and Macao and 
undertaking several digital microwave projects. 
  Meanwhile, Guangdong will add 110 postal vans and build 200 
more post and telecommunication offices to meet growing demand. 
  Guangdong's post and telecommunications business is expected 
to amount to 14 billion yuan ($1.61 billion) this year. In 1993 
telecommunications alone earned the province 9.4 billion yuan 
($1.1 billion). 
  And by 2010 the post and telecommunication industry is 
expected to have fixed assets worth 270 billion yuan ($31 
billion). By then Guangdong will have enough installed capacity 
to provide telephone service to 45 of every 100 residents. 
  As of l993, 6 percent of Guangdong's residents had a 
telephone, compared with the national rate of 2.15 per cent. 
  It is expected that in the next two decades, Guangdong will 
add 2 million telephone users every year. Last year 1 million 
customers were added to push the total beyond 5 million, or 20 
per cent of the country's total. 
  To further promote the industry, Guangdong is considering 
more imports of advanced equipments this year.

  [Text] Nanjing, February 18 (XINHUA) -- Burgeoning 
multi-leveled labour markets in east China's Jiangsu Province 
have effectively alleviated the problem of unemployment and 
maintained social stability by affording regular work 
opportunities for many local people. 
  Last year, a total of 206,000 people found jobs through 
labour markets, reducing the unemployment rate of the province 
to two percent, lower than the country's average. 
  To answer the call of establishing a socialist market 
economy, Jiangsu labour departments have exerted themselves to 
foster development of labour markets in recent years. 
  By now, well-functioning profession-introduction 
institutions 
have been established in Jiangsu's 11 cities and 64 counties and 
more than 75 percent of its towns and villages have improved 
services involving employment. 
  Combining group recommendation with individual introduction, 
these labour markets manage to satisfy the fluctuating needs of 
enterprises and institutions for labour forces. 
  They also offer a series of services for employers, 
including 
delivering employment information, handling recruitment 
procedure and taking out employment insurance. 
  Apart from setting up labour markets all over the province, 
local labour departments have strictly implemented the relevant 
laws and regulations and strengthened supervision and direction 
for the operation of privately-owned profession-introduction 
institutions, to keep the development of labour markets sound. 
  Employment training programmes have been offered by labour 
departments at all levels. 
  However, as the improved labour markets have attracted not 
only those who are seeking employment but also those who want to 
change jobs for more lucrative ones, substantial changes have 
also occurred in employment training courses. 
  Now people from all walks of life can benefit from these 
courses by learning skills and knowledge, either to increase 
competitiveness in employment or just for interest. 
  Various employment training centers all over Jiangsu 
province 
now total 601, with more than 110,000 people having received 
technical training last year. 
  Jiangsu Province is abundant in labour forces. Surplus rural 
labour forces in northern Jiangsu used to be a headache for 
local people. 
  In past several years labour markets have effectively 
channeled surplus labour forces to other provinces or even 
foreign countries which are short of labour. 
  Along with a flourishing labour market, competition for 
employment has become more fierce. Local provincial government 
has accordingly attached much importance to the improvement of 
unemployment security. 
  Relief funds are extended to people who are out of work for 
less than two years. Some well-run large enterprises are chosen 
to provide temporary working opportunities for jobless people. 
  Jiangsu Province has also boosted the development of the 
service industries as part of the efforts to create more 
employment opportunities for unemployed people.

  [Text] Shanghai, February 18 (XINHUA) -- Expansion of 
opening-up and establishment of a modernized market system will 
be stressed this year to make more economic gains, stated Huang 
Ju, mayor of Shanghai, in his government work report to the 
second meeting of the tenth session of the Shanghai Municipal 
People's Congress. 
  The mayor called for exploration of new forms and channels 
in 
utilizing foreign capital and to attract foreign investment for 
large-scale urban construction projects to be implemented by the 
municipal government. 
  Forms like Sino-foreign joint investment and exploration, 
establishment of share-issuing joint ventures and BOT (building 
-- operating -- transferring) will be adopted to accelerate the 
steps of urban infrastructure constructions. 
  Sino-foreign jointly-funded companies for foreign trade, 
commercial wholesale enterprises and production/retail 
enterprises will be set up this year on a trial basis as part of 
the efforts to help local products enter international markets. 
  Shanghai also plans to develop overseas trust companies, 
common fund and share-holding companies and invite more foreign 
finance institutions and well known transnational group 
companies to establish regional headquarters in shanghai. 
  Large well-run enterprises are encouraged to use foreign 
funds and to seek technological cooperation with world-renowned 
overseas companies, especially in such fields as auto industry, 
communications, electronics industry, computers, petrochemical 
industry and metallurgical industry, the mayor said. 
  Apart from further boosting opening-up, Shanghai municipal 
government will also attach much importance to the establishment 
of a modernized market system in order to give the city full 
play as the country's center of resource allocation. 
  To be set up are a foreign currency exchange, a gold market, 
including gold ornaments, gold bullion and futures, and a 
national market for inter-bank lending. 
  Based on the existing discount business, a market of 
discount 
and rediscount will be improved. Security market and financial 
leasing market will also be opened up, according to Huang Ju. 
  The mayor encouraged various markets already existing to 
enhance the quality of management and operation in order to 
adapt to international market standards as soon as possible.

<F P=106> [By China editor Cary Huang] </F>
  [Text] Apparently denouncing Beijing's repeated warnings 
on economics in recent weeks, the leadership in Shanghai is set 
to continue fast-paced economic growth and push forward bold 
reform packages. The move emphasised a wide split between the 
local government of China's largest industrial city and the 
central authorities in the Chinese capital, according to 
Shanghai-based China analysts. 
  With support from paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, local 
authorities even dared to defy directives from their former 
bosses, the Chinese President and Communist Party chief Jiang 
Zemin and economic supremo Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, Shanghai 
sources told The Hongkong Standard yesterday. 
  Both Mr Jiang and Mr Zhu were Shanghai party chiefs and 
mayors before they were promoted to Beijing after a 1989 
military crackdown on nation-wide pro-democracy movements. 
  The municipal party authorities reached a consensus recently 
to seize the historic opportunity to continue its economic 
momentum despite the fact Mr Jiang and Mr Zhu recently warned 
the locality to sincerely implement Beijing's latest directives 
on economics. 
  Fearing social instability from increasingly inflationary 
pressure, Beijing has decided to suspend some sweeping reforms 
and slow down the growth in a bid to cool down the economic 
overheatings. Mr Zhu also ordered all reform packages and 
development plans that might spur inflation temporarily shelved 
until a more "favourable environment was created." 
  But in a municipal economic conference early this month, the 
secretary of Shanghai's Communist Party Municipal Committee, Wu 
Bangguo, assured local officials that the city was to maintain 
its pace in reform with its "three no's" policy. 
  The list promoted no changes to previous policies and plans; 
no withdrawal of economic power delegating to lower authorities 
under economic liberalisation; and no publicising what the city 
did. 
  Meanwhile, the party authorities have agreed on an ambitious 
development plan for 1994, revealed yesterday by mayor Huang Ju 
to the ongoing annual session of the municipal law-making body. 
Brushing aside problems of inflation and overheating, Mr Huang 
said Shanghai would continue to maintain high growth rates this 
year. Describing 1994 as a crucial year for reform in the city, 
Mr Huang said: "If we want to speed up development we must dare 
to face challenges." Mr Huang made no mention of Beijing's 
austere measures for creating credit and 'investment. The mayor 
called for a growth of 12 percent this year which is much higher 
than the national average of nine per cent set by Beijing. 
  Mr Huang's speech reflected all the priorities of paramount 
Chinese Ieader Dcng Xiaoping, who wanted the city to pioneer 
China's reforms and development in the 1990's and used the city 
as a platform to campaign for his ideas. 
  However, Mr Huang also warned of the danger of unemployment 
which, along with inflation, is the biggest worry for Chinese 
workers. 
  Many Shanghai factories have reduced working hours or are 
paying staff a minimum wage to stay at home.

  [Text] Shanghai, February 19 (CNS)--According to relevant 
municipal departments, Shanghai City is now busy making 
preparations for the establishment of markets for labour force 
coming from outside of the city. The move is considered helpful 
in introducing labourers into the city, the largest industrial 
base in the country, and beneficial to having this work done in 
an organized and ordered way and to the easing to a certain 
extent of the "labour wave" imposed upon the municipality. 
  The city has recently set up an office in charge of 
administration over such labourers employed by entities and 
units in the city. The markets designed for such labourers will 
be open to all places in the country and allow various places to 
export labourers to the city where the introduction of such 
workers will be subject to market competition. Those units 
needing such labourers, except in particular circumstances, will 
have to have approval from labour departments at the city's 
district or county level prior to recruiting such workers in 
designated markets of this kind, and a contract will be required 
to be signed between the employer and employee, becoming 
effective only after it is testified to and sealed by the market 
authorities.

  [Text] Shanghai, February 19 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai is 
pouring huge sums into a program of modernizing its production 
facilities, in a bid to restore its status as China's prime 
industrial center. 
  According to an official with the Shanghai Municipal 
Committee for Restructuring the Economy, a total of 9 billion 
yuan will go to 18 projects in their technological upgrading 
this year. 
  The investment and output value of all these projects reach 
200 million yuan and one billion yuan, respectively. 
  Scheduled to fulfill these projects at the end of this year, 
the city will have a capacity of 150,000 Santana sedans, 150,000 
videos, 2.1 million program-controlled switchboards and 400,000 
air compressors. That will result in an annual increase of 17.8 
billion yuan in output value and 3.5 billion yuan in taxes and 
profits. 
  Another 32 projects which exert great impact on the city's 
industrial restructuring can also get 5.5 billion yuan to renew 
their old facilities. When they are completed, their output 
value and taxes and profits will jump by 8.2 billion yuan and 
1.1 billion yuan, respectively. 
  The municipal government hopes that the projects will help 
Shanghai regain its leading position as a pilot in the country's 
industrial development and narrow the gap compared with 
developed countries. 
  The city has injected nearly 40 billion yuan into 
technological improvement of some 500 projects since 1988. As a 
result, the annual growth in these projects' output value and 
tax and profits has accounted for two-thirds of the city's total 
industrial output value and profits increments.

  [Text] Shanghai, February 21 (XINHUA) -- The population of 
China's biggest city, Shanghai, last year showed a negative 
growth rate for the first time. 
  Statistics from the Shanghai Statistics Bureau show that 
Shanghai's natural population growth rate stood at minus 0.8 per 
thousand in 1993, declining further from the rate of the 
previous year, 0.21 per thousand. 
  A governmental official says that the decline in population 
is due to the city's social and cultural development, as well as 
that of medicine and health care. 
  In contrast to the city's population decline, which is 
calculated from the number of citizens with permanent residence 
permits, the official said, the growth rate of the mobile 
population is alarmingly high. 
  The Shanghai government is going to take specific measures 
to 
tackle the problem, he said.

the zone. 
  Officials with the Chedun Economic and Technological 
Development Zone said they hoped to build the zone into a base 
for carrying out experimental application of newly-developed 
scientific and technological achievements and for industrial 
mass production. 
  The zone will offer a series of services to attract more 
returned Chinese students to launch businesses. The services 
include handling visas for the students, providing residential 
housing and workshops at perferential terms, offering legal 
consultancy, and helping find cooperation partners.

  This was stated at the work meeting of Shanghai overseas 
enterprises, which ended here yesterday. 
  As the representative of Shanghai municipal government for 
overseas investment and headquarters of all Shanghai's 
enterprises and companies in foreign countries, the Shanghai 
Overseas Company has decide to center its efforts on 
establishment of more overseas group companies this year. 
  By now, more than 420 enterprises belonging to Shanghai's 
Foreign Trade, Industry, Agriculture and Science Departments 
have been set up in 60-plus countries and regions of the world, 
managing to increase exports and primarily form an overseas 
marketing network. 
  To better organize these diverse enterprises and increase 
their competitiveness in international markets, Shanghai 
Overseas Company is now determined to shift them toward 
multi-functional transnational group companies. 
  Apart from the existing five overseas group companies in 
Oceania, America, CIS, Japan and Hong Kong, a new one will be 
set up in Europe. Branches will also be added in Singapore, the 
Republic of Korea, Africa and South-East Asia. 
  These group companies will carry out varied transnational 
business through share-purchasing, share-holding, annexing and 
joint management and marketing. 
  International standards will be adopted in the management of 
these group companies and decision-making powers in many aspects 
will be granted to the overseas companies themselves. 
  It is also expected that by taking advantage of existing 
overseas marketing networks, specialized talents, management 
experience and information on demand, the new group companies to 
be established will stimulate exports and foreign trade of 
domestic enterprises. 
  Shanghai Overseas Company also aims to establish a domestic 
trade network based on the 9,000-plus foreign trade enterprises 
in Shanghai to match its overseas network.

  [Text] The Guangxi Regional People's Government recently 
promulgated a decision on the implementation of a 
revenue-sharing system. The decision points out: The 
implementation of a revenue-sharing system is a major decision 
of the party Central Committee and the State Council and is an 
important element of economic structural reform. 
  The decision demands: Following the implementation a 
revenue- sharing system, first, it is necessary to strengthen 
graded budgetary management, and an additional expenditure 
should be borne by the relevant administrative level. The 
regional government will not bear expenditures which should be 
borne by a prefecture, city, or county, or vice versa. Second, 
it is necessary to strengthen management over administrative 
spending, to improve control over administrative expenditures, 
to exercise strict management over expenditure limits, and to 
encourage departments with the necessary conditions to increase 
their income. 
  Third, it is necessary to strengthen management over the 
collections of administrative charges and to put them under 
budgetary management so as to prevent the loss of revenue. 
Fourth, it is necessary to strengthen management over 
extrabudgetary funds. The administrative departments' budgetary 
and extrabudgetary revenue should be put in a uniform revenue 
and expenditure plan. Fifth, it is necessary to forge a balance 
between revenue and expenditures. Under the revenue-sharing 
system, prefectures and cities should work out their budgets in 
such a way that a balance between revenue and expenditures can 
be maintained with some surpluses. The regional financial 
department is not responsible for making up prefectures' or 
cities' deficits; in such cases, the prefectures and cities 
should make efforts to resolve them. 
  The decision stresses: The implementation of the 
revenue-sharing system is a major step in financial reform. All 
prefectural administrative offices and city governments should 
strengthen their leadership to ensure its smooth implementation.

  [Text] A provincial on-site meeting on spring wheat field 
management was held in Jiaozu City on 17 February. At present, 
the situation of wheat production in our province is grim. In 
more than 12 million mu of wheat fields across the province, the 
condition of wheat seedlings is generally poorer than that last 
year. The area of category-one seedlings has declined by 12.6 
percent over the same period last year, 10 million mu of wheat 
lack fertilizer, and the area of wheat hit by drought throughout 
the province has reached 40 million mu. If appropriate measures 
are not taken, a sharp decline in grain output will emerge in 
summer this year. 
  The meeting pointed out: Now is the crucial season for wheat 
field management, so various localities must seize this 
opportune moment, mobilize the masses, and rapidly set off an 
upsurge of wheat field management to bring about a change in the 
condition of wheat seedlings. The meeting also called for all 
localities to pay serious attention to major contradictions in 
light of the prominent problems that exist in various kinds of 
wheat fields. The fields that still need plowing, irrigating, 
and top-dressing should be done properly, the practice of rigid 
uniformity should be avoided, and efforts should concentrated on 
enhancing the efficiency of field management.

  [Text] A provincial judicial work meeting ended yesterday 
afternoon [19 February]. Provincial party Secretary Wang Maolin 
and Governor Chen Bangzhu attended and addressed the meeting. 
  Comrade Wang Maolin said: The year 1994 is an important and 
crucial one for deepening reform, and it is very important to do 
a good job in this year's judicial work. Departments at all 
levels should fully understand the importance of maintaining 
social stability in the new situation and should strengthen 
party leadership over judicial work so as to ensure political 
stability and social tranquility. In resolving social order 
problems, there is a need to look into their root cause and 
phenomena; to strengthen the formation of the judicial 
contingent; and to fully display judicial departments' functions 
in safeguarding party and state power, in preserving the 
people's interests, and in protecting reform, opening up, and 
economic development. 
  In his speech, Governor Chen Bangzhu pointed out: Following 
the deepening of reform and opening up, some new problems and 
situations will emerge which will add to the difficulties in 
maintaining social stability. Principal party and government 
leaders at all levels should pay full attention to this and do 
their best to help maintain social stability.

  [Text] Shortly after the Spring Festival in 1994, some 
enterprises in the province relaxed their efforts in production. 
Yesterday a provincial telephone meeting on industrial 
production and communications development was held to sound the 
alarm for these enterprises. 
  At yesterday's meeting, Governor Chen Bangzhu stressed: 
People throughout the province should seize the present 
favorable opportunity and concentrate their efforts on 
industrial production and communications development. Vice 
Governor Zhou Bohua and Xu Youfa, chairman of the Provincial 
Economic Commission, made arrangements for the next step in 
industrial production and communications development. 
  In January this year, staff members and workers on the 
industrial and communications front overcame their funding 
difficulties. The gross industrial output value at the township 
level and above amounted to 6.8 billion yuan, an increase of 
35.2 percent over the same period of last year, and their 
production and marketing rate increased by 3.2 percent over 
January of last year. Many cadres and staff members gave up 
their holidays for work. But quite a few enterprises allowed 
their staff members and workers to overstay their holidays, and 
a small number of enterprises have still not resumed production. 
As a result, more than 7 million kilowatt hours of electricity 
currently remain unused at the end of every day. 
  The future of the market looks bright; the metallurgical, 
building materials, and nonferrous metallic industries have 
continued to see a good marketing trend; and the textile, coal, 
chemical, and light industries are recovering from a depression, 
while some of their products have fallen short of supply. 
  Spring is a crucial time of year. Governor Chen Bangzhu 
asked the governments at all levels to strengthen their 
leadership over industrial production, to reduce unnecessary 
courtesy activities and travel, and to help enterprises with 
production. 
  Vice Governor Zhou Bohua encouraged enterprises to boost 
morale, to organize production, to ensure a 22.5 percent 
increase for the first quarter of this year, and to lay a good 
foundation for the fulfillment of the annual tasks in industrial 
production and communications development. He also issued 
detailed requirements for enterprises' stability and steady 
production.

  [Excerpts] Yesterday morning [19 February], the provincial 
party committee held a meeting to relay instructions from the 
Central Commission on Politics and Law concerning the 
maintenance of social stability. Provincial Party Secretary Yin 
Kesheng attended and addressed the meeting, saying: The 
instructions from the Central Commission on Politics and Law are 
important guidance for the province's work in maintaining social 
stability. These instructions give expression to the party 
Central Committee and State Council's care and concern for the 
people of Qinghai, and we should take effective meassures to 
implement them. 
  Yin Kesheng pointed out: The most important point in 
implementing the instructions from the Central Commission on 
Politics and Law is to unify our thinking and improve our 
understanding. The crucial point is to unify the ideas of party 
leaders at all levels and to improve their understanding. In 
this way, we will be able to maintain unanimity in action and 
make achievements in our work. He said: We should fully 
confirm our achievements in maintaining social stability since 
the beginning of last year, coolly analyze the present 
situation, and always remain sober-minded. For this reason, we 
should do two types of work simultaneously and lay equal stress 
on both. [passage omitted] 
  Yin Keshing continued: In maintaining social stability, we 
should abide by the mass line, and should firmly trust the 
masses and rely on them. He added: Whether or not a leading 
comrade does solid work is an important criterion by which to 
judge his sense of responsibility and his leadership ability. 
[passage omitted] 
  There is a need to encourage people to do their work 
creatively; to strengthen supervision over work; to work with 
one heart; and to do a better job in maintaining social 
stability, in expediting reform and opening up, in speeding up 
economic development, and in promoting Qinghai's economic 
construction to a new level.

<F P=106> [By reporters Li Dadong (7812 1129 2639) and Liu Tongqi </F>
(0491 0681 6386)] 
  [Text] Urumqi, 12 Feb (XINHUA) -- The Tajik nationality, 
who used to shy away from business undertakings, started to get 
involved in the commodity economy in just a few short years 
following reform and opening up. 
  During a recent trip to Taxkorgan County on the Pamirs 
Highland, reporters learned that none of the county's 22,000 
Tajik people was a trader in the mid-eighties. Herdsmen living 
on the Pamirs Highland toiled to raise livestock throughout the 
year and refused to sell them even as the animals grew old and 
died. They lived a poor but contented life. 
  In 1986, the county's Hongqilafu border port was formally 
opened to third countries. Later, a 420-km road linked it with 
border ports on the highland, making Hongqilafu one of the most 
important and busiest trading ports between our country's 
western region and Central Asian countries. The endless stream 
of visiting merchants broke the long-existing silence of the 
Pamirs Highland. Seeing that businessmen of the Uygur, Han, and 
Hui nationalities became well-off one after another, the Tajik 
people could no longer sit still. 
  By the end of 1993, some 150 Tajik individual households and 
private enterprises had emerged in Taxkorgan County. They 
opened shops, restaurants, hotels, and video shops in towns, 
border ports, as well as along the Sino-Pakistani highway. Some 
of them bought automobiles especially to transport goods between 
border ports and Kashi city, or directly engaged in 
transnational border trade. Some people even teamed up with 
Pakistani businessmen to open restaurants in towns which did a 
brisk business. Farmers and herdsmen living near towns changed 
their tradition of not engaging in vegetable farming, and 
started to grow vegetables extensively for market sales. 
Subsequently, a group of large vegetable farming households 
emerged. 
  Today, Taxkorgan has numerous shops and stores. As reporters 
went to remote villages, they frequently met Tajik merchants 
engaging in various trades as well as peasants and herdsmen 
engaging in precious stone mining. Some jewelers from Jiangsu, 
Zhejiang, and Sichuan buy precious stones in remote mountains 
and valleys here throughout the year. A group of previously 
poor peasants, such as Mairepu and Tayier, have now become 
specialized households and private mining enterprise owners with 
tens of thousands of yuan in assets. 
  The first border trade company in Taxkorgan County was 
established in 1992. The company actively linked peasants and 
herdsmen together to participate in border trade. The export 
and import value in the first year alone reached $900,000, 
making it the company in the county with the largest income. To 
cope with tens of thousands of visiting Chinese and foreign 
businessmen, the county invested in building the Pamirs Hotel as 
well as developed local tourist attractions, scenic spots, 
cultural relics, and historic sites to establish a tourist 
industry. In 1993, the county's income from the tourist trade 
reached 750,000 yuan. 
  County chief Mierzhayi told reporters that village and town 
enterprises have grown rapidly from nothing. The Tajik people 
have shaken off the restrictions of a pastoral life and 
established a group of village and town enterprises, such as a 
mineral water bottling plant, a precious stone plant, an iron 
mine, and a brickyard. The output value of the entire county's 
village and town enterprises was 330,000 yuan in 1992. However, 
in 1993, the output value of the Pamirs Mineral Water Bottling 
Plant and the brickyard alone exceeded 1.3 million yuan.

  [Text] The Mainland Affairs Council [MAC] on Thursday [17 
February] rejected the Economic Ministry's proposal to build 
direct shipping links across the Taiwan Strait. The Economic 
Ministry recently proposed that direct shipping links between 
specific ports in special zones in Taiwan and Mainland China be 
allowed, first to reduce transportation cost and time mainly for 
mainland-bound shipping from Taiwan and vice versa. But in a 
study report released Thursday, MAC said the cost of direct 
shipping links between specified ports or cities across the 
Strait is virtually the same as the cost of across-the-board 
direct shipping links between Taiwan and the mainland. The 
council argued that cross-Strait direct shipping links will be 
most likely accompanied by several major problems. These 
include Taiwan's greater reliance on Mainland China on the 
economic and trade front, a more rampant smuggling of Mainland 
Chinese products, and the illegal entry of mainlanders into 
Taiwan.

  [Text] The mainland's Association for Relations Across the 
Taiwan Straits [ARATS] yesterday [18 February] sent a message to 
the Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] in which it expressed the 
hope that private visits to the mainland by Taiwan officials can 
be arranged through the cooperation of the two organizations. 
This is the first time that ARATS has ever made such a request. 
It also shows that the Chinese Communists' departments in charge 
of work toward Taiwan is trying to use this as a tool for 
further strengthening official contacts across the Straits. 
  As the Chinese Communists do not recognize our country as a 
reciprocal political entity, it has been learned that they 
welcome Taiwan's high-ranking officials to visit the mainland as 
long as their visit is of a private nature. The Chinese 
Communist authorities have even openly indicated they welcome 
President Li Teng-hui to visit the mainland on a private trip. 
Moreover, after President Li Teng-hui paid an unofficial visit 
to the three Southeast Asian countries, the mainland side's 
suggestion, made through the ARATS, that intermediate 
organizations of the two sides make arrangements for officials 
of our side to visit the mainland on a private trip, affords 
much food for thought. 
  It has been learned that the message faxed by the ARATS 
yesterday was in the form of the script of talks by a person in 
charge of the ARATS. The SEF has noted that the ARATS' 
intention is to place Taiwan's officials' visit to the mainland 
under its overall management. Regarding out side's reply, the 
SEF said it will replay to ARATS after consulting with the 
Mainland Affairs Council.

  [Text] Yesterday [18 February], in view of another mainland 
airliner being hijacked to Taiwan, Wu Po-hsiung, interior 
minister and head of the group on handling matters related to 
hijacking under the Executive Yuan, reiterated the government's 
stand of strongly condemning hijackings. He also stressed that 
because of security considerations, Taiwan will continue to 
employ the principle of handling separately the hijackers and 
the airplane concerned, and the repatriation of the hijacked 
airplane. 
  Wu Po-hsiung said that the repeated hijackings of Communist 
China's civilian passenger planes to Taiwan has exposed 
Communist China's serious gaps in its security checks. He added 
that the fundamental way to solve the problem of hijackings lies 
in Communist China's strengthening its interior security 
measures. 
  Meanwhile, Kao Kung-lian, vice chairman of the Mainland 
Affairs Council and its spokesman, said that because of the 
repeated occurrences of the hijacking of mainland airliners to 
Taiwan, he hoped that the mainland authorities will show 
sincerity, hold follow-up working-level talks as soon as 
possible, and sign an agreement on the repatriation of hijackers 
as quickly as possible so that mainland hijackers can be 
repatriated according to the stipulations of the agreement. 
  Yesterday, the Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF], in 
addition 
to employing its channels for contacts with the mainland's 
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits [ARATS] and 
informing its counterpart about information concerning the 
hijacking, also called on the mainland authorities to adopt 
positive measures to effectively put a stop to hijackings. It 
also expressed the hope that the SEF-ARATS talks will quickly 
reach an agreement on the agenda concerning the repatriation of 
hijackers at the fourth working-level consultations meeting to 
be held in Beijing at the end of March.

during the tour and assign them to ministries for 
implementation. Yuan Tung has filed the following report: 
  [Begin Yuan recording] Foreign Minister Chien Fu; Hsiao 
Wan-chang, Chairman of the Council for Economic Planning 
Development [CEPD], and (?Tai Yue-ming), deputy secretary 
general and spokesman of the Presidential Office, made reports 
or offered explanations of President Li's unofficial visit at 
the 17 February regular meeting of the Executive Yuan. Premier 
Lien Chan said: The President's visit is indeed very fruitful. 
  (?Wu Chung-li), deputy director of the Government 
Information 
Office [GIO], relayed Premier Lien Chan's comments: 
  [Begin (?Wu) recording] Taiwan does not have official 
diplomatic ties with the three countries. The visit is, 
therefore, historic. This is particularly so in view of the 
deteriorating diplomatic situation our nation has faced in the 
past decade or more. The tour represents a rare feat. [end 
(?Wu) recording] 
  Premier Lien also pointed out: The themes of President Li's 
tour were peace, progress, and prosperity and its principal goal 
is to promote the common welfare in the region. It will have a 
positive impact on development in the Asian-Pacific region as a 
whole. 
  GIO deputy director (?Wu) relayed Premier Lien Chan's 
instructions: 
  [Begin (?Wu) recording] Our main goals are to promote the 
common interest and welfare of the region. Every country or 
individual that genuinely cares about that region should support 
such an idea. For this reason, Premier Lien commented, it is 
hard to understand why the Chinese Communists voiced objections. 
The premier said regional cooperation and ties of this kind are 
conducive to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and 
the world. Under the themes of peace, progress, and prosperity, 
the countries concerned in Southeast Asia can help one another 
and obtain many cooperation projects through bilateral or 
multilateral cooperation. Once the foreign ministry and CEPD 
compile the list of cooperation projects and sort out the 
opportunities and plans, the work can be divided up among the 
ministries and commissions concerned for implementation. [end 
(?Wu) recording] 
  Premier Lien also thanked the countries and heads of state 
that accorded hearty hospitality to President Li. He also 
thanked the personnel of the foreign ministry and CEPD for their 
hard work in connection with the trip. [end Yuan recording]

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 19 (CNA) -- The main purpose of 
President Li Teng-hui's recent informal visit to Southeast Asia 
was to demonstrate the Republic of China [ROC]'s desire to play 
an active and constructive role in the international community, 
a Presidential Office spokesman said Saturday. 
  "President Li expressed Taiwan's intention to share its 
experience in economic development with other countries during 
his three-country Southeast Asia tour," Raymond Tai, deputy 
secretary-general to the president, explained at a forum 
sponsored by the CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY. 
  Tai said Li's visit was also aimed at promoting trade and 
economic cooperation with Taiwan's neighboring countries. 
  "The president hoped to find new regional cooperation fields 
through his visit to The Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand," 
noted Tai who accompanied Li on his Feb. 9-16 visit, also billed 
as a "vacation trip." 
  Speaking on the same occasion, opposition legislator Lu 
Hsiu-yi praised Li's pragmatic attitude in expanding Taiwan's 
international presence. 
  "Albeit unofficial," Lu said, "the eight-day visit has 
spotlighted Taiwan's existence, which Beijing has persistently 
tried to ignore or deny." 
  "Li's effort to promote economic cooperation with Southeast 
Asian nations also complies with the post-Cold War world trend," 
Lu noted. Regional economic cooperation is the catchword in 
today's international relations. 
  "It is a correct strategy for Taiwan to strengthen economic 
ties with Southeast Asian nations as a way to balance its 
rapidly growing investment in Mainland China which remains 
hostile toward Taipei," Lu added. 
  Jeffrey Ku, chairman of Chinatrust Commercial Bank and a 
dollar-a-year adviser to the cabinet, said at the CNA forum that 
Li's Southeast Asia visit would help encourage more Taiwan 
industrialists to invest in the region. 
  Ku, also a member on Li's entourage, said Beijing had tried 
every possible means to block Li's unofficial visit. "We quietly 
swallowed all disgrace on many occasions in order to accomplish 
our task," Ku recalled. 
  "Li's low profile and sincerity have won him friendship and 
respect of political leaders in the three countries, including 
Philippine President Fidel Ramos, Indonesian President Suharto 
and Thai King Phumiphon Adunyadet," Ku observed. 
  The business tycoon added he believes that following Li's 
visit, the three countries will take gradual steps to improve 
services for Taiwan investors.

  [Text] Boston, Feb. 18 (CNA) -- A Ranking Republic of 
China [ROC] Government official said here Friday that Taiwan is 
willing to play a role in the maintenance of peace and security 
in Asia. 
  "As an Asia-Pacific nation, the Republic of China cannot 
stay 
outside regional development. We are prepared to make our 
contributions to Asia-Pacific security and economic 
cooperation," Jason Hu, director-general of the Government 
Information Office, said in a speech delivered at the Yen-Ching 
Library of Harvard University. 
  In the speech titled "The Prospects for a changing Asia: A 
Case for Open-Style Regionalism," Hu stressed that "we are 
willing to play an active and appropriate role under the more 
inclusive and dynamic political and economic framework that is 
taking shape in the Asia-Pacific region." 
  However, the government spokesman pointed out a minimum 
military balance across the Taiwan Strait must be sustained so 
that the 21 million people on Taiwan can live free from worry 
and devote themselves to economic development and political 
reform. 
  "It can also give us a sense of security in dealing with the 
People's Republic of China, and foster the confidence to promote 
positive interaction between the two sides," Hu said. 
  In his speech, Hu also pointed out that the number of 
potential crises in the region has fueled the desire for a 
Southeast Asia regional security system. 
  Hu quoted ROC President Li Teng-hui as saying that such a 
system should start with an informal ad hoc "security dialogue," 
and the ROC is more than willing to join the system. 
  Taiwan, located at a pivotal point between Northeast Asia 
and 
Southeast Asia, "surely would constitute an indispensable link 
in the Asian security system and among partners in the security 
dialogue." 
  Turning to the ROC's mainland policy, Hu said Taiwan is bent 
on maintaining non-official channels of communication, 
strengthening people-to-people exchanges, mapping out economic 
and investment activities, and increasing a bilateral "win-win" 
consensus.

<F P=106> ["Text" of President Li Teng-hui's 9 February greetings to </F>
the nation on the eve of Lunar New Year] 
  [Text] Dear elders, brothers and sisters: Peace to you 
all! 
  On the eve of the Lunar New Year, I would like to extend New 
Year's greetings to all compatriots at home and abroad, wishing 
you a happy New Year and every success. 
  The year end is a time for reviewing the past and looking to 
the future. Over the past year, thanks to the concerted efforts 
of all compatriots, we have achieved substantive progress and 
fruitful results in internal, economic, diplomatic and cultural 
affairs, as well as in cross-strait relations. 
  In internal affairs, our long-term endeavor to promote 
democracy has taken root and begun to blossom in the Taiwan, 
Penghu, Chinmen and Matzu areas. The elections of county 
magistrates and a city mayor held toward the end of 1993 and of 
county and city assemblymen two weeks ago came to successful 
conclusions, even though the styles of fierce campaigning still 
need much improvement through the joint efforts of all people. 
Obviously our countrymen have gradually become more familiar 
with the exercise of democracy and, while airing individual 
views, have also displayed the consensus of sharing a common 
destiny, thus enabling us to take a giant stride toward a 
rational, just society. 
  In economic affairs, despite the global depression our 
society, propelled by its enormous vitality, has seen a steady 
and continual expansion of the national economy, achieving a 6 
percent growth rate. The government's efforts to improve the 
investment environment and open up the market for free 
competition have also laid a sound foundation for Taiwan to 
become a business center of the Asia-Pacific region. 
  In diplomatic affairs, we have adhered to the pragmatic 
principle of working actively to return to the international 
community, thus arousing the attention of various countries to 
the existence of the Republic of China [ROC] as well as their 
awareness of the reality of China's separation and divided rule. 
Through participating in international organizations, attending 
international conferences, and strengthening cooperation with 
and providing humanitarian aid to foreign countries, we have won 
the affirmation of the international community and, even more, 
the respect and position we deserve. 
  In cultural affairs, we have integrated traditional with 
modern cultures to create the most dynamic new culture in 
Chinese history. Through popularizing cultural activities, we 
have incrementally achieved successes in enriching our 
countrymen's cultural life and fostered their awareness of 
individuals versus community and state. 
  In cross-strait relations, we have prudently carried out the 
policy toward the mainland in line with the timetable set in the 
"National Reunification Program." Since the Ku-Wang meeting, 
mutual understanding between the two sides of the strait has 
been further enhanced through consultations on routine affairs, 
exchange of visits by people of various circles, and continuous 
nongovernmental exchanges, thereby enabling the "Taiwan 
experience" to exert considerable influence in the Chinese 
Mainland. 
  Dear elders, brothers and sisters: The achievements over the 
past year have laid the foundation for future development. 
Looking into the future, we are confident and determined to 
once again open up a new situation in history. Meanwhile, we 
must thoroughly recognize the following: 
  -- The ROC's development will not lead to its alienation 
from 
the mainland. As a matter of fact, the fruitful results of our 
endeavor for political democratization and economic 
modernization have placed us in the van of a transformation 
period of Chinese culture; and our experience during the course 
of development is precisely what Mainland China will need in the 
future. 
  -- The ROC should not shut itself out of the international 
community, but should actively participate in international 
affairs and exert its utmost to the establishment of a new 
international order. Moreover, it should play a more active 
role in consolidating economic relations between Asia-Pacific 
nations and should become a major partner in promoting regional 
development. 
  -- The mainland, which should have maintained brotherly 
relations with Taiwan, must abandon its anachronistic ideology 
and structure and carry out economic modernization and political 
democratization with new knowledge, understanding, and 
strategies so as to work together with us in striving to 
rejuvenate the Chinese nation and assist each other with full 
pride in the international arena. 
  Another new year is around the corner. I hope all countrymen 
will continue to work concertedly and will dedicate themselves 
to the people of this land, striving to rejuvenating the Chinese 
nation and creating a brighter future. Finally, once again, 
best wishes and a happy New Year to you all. Thank you!

  [Text] The Agricultural Council under the Executive Yuan 
stated yesterday that it could not agree to lower all tariffs 
for individual agricultural products to below 20 percent and 
that Taiwan will not categorically refuse the [word indistinct] 
proposed by the United States, noting the need to wait until the 
major supplying countries and the final results of the 
negotiations [as heard]. The bilateral consultation meeting with 
the United States over Taiwan's joining the GATT will begin next 
Thursday [24 February]. 
  The Agricultural Council is said to be working out the 
bottom 
line in talks and the room for maneuver in lowering the tariffs 
in view of the United States' call for the lowering of tariffs 
on 387 items. It is said that the percentage for tariff 
reductions on 387 items is greater than that requested by the 
United States during the talks on tariff cuts in January, and 
that the United States wants Taiwan to slash tariffs on the 
majority of agricultural products by more than 50 percent. The 
United States also requested Taiwan not to set all tariffs on 
individual agricultural products at higher than 20 percent. 
  At the upcoming bilateral consultation meeting with the 
United States over Taiwan's joining GATT, the United States is 
expected to again call on Taiwan to further slash tariffs on the 
over 100 agricultural products on which Taiwan had earlier 
agreed in the talks in January to make cuts.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 21 (CNA) -- Taiwan will lift its import 
restrictions on apples in preparation for entry into the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Council of Agriculture (COA) 
said Sunday [20 February]. 
  However, imported apples will face even stricter quarantine 
measures after the restrictions are lifted, especially those 
from the United States, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and 
Chile, which have been declared codling moth regions, the COA 
added. 
  COA officials said that Taiwan currently limits the purchase 
of apples from the US and allows limited imports from Japan, 
Australia and New Zealand. 
  The officials said that after lifting the restrictions, 
apples from Japan and Korea will have the competitive edge here 
while apples from the US, Australia and New Zealand will not be 
allowed in if they do not meet the stricter quarantine measures. 
  COA officials said that the enhanced quarantine measures are 
necessary to protect domestic agriculture in the face of an 
expected flood of imported apples. 
  Australia and New Zealand have expressed concern about the 
new quarantine measures, Sun Ming-hsien, COA chairman, said upon 
his return home Sunday from a weeklong visit to New Zealand. 
  Sun said he has agreed to a New Zealand request for a 
meeting 
on the measures. The time of the meeting has yet to be set, he 
noted. 
  Australia is also expected to raise the issue of the new 
quarantine measures during a scheduled meeting with COA in March.

  [Text] Yesterday, Nintendo Corporation of America and some 
60 video game cartridge companies formally called on U.S. Trade 
Representative Office to keep Taiwan included on the special 301 
priority watchlist. 
  (Vansaw), legal adviser to Nintendo, pointed out that as 
Taiwan is still allowing the export of fake Nintendo video game 
products all over the world, Taiwan still remains the world's 
major source of fake products. 
  Yesterday, the Board of Foreign Trade under the Ministry of 
Economic Affairs lodged a strong protest over Nintendo 
Corporation of America's request of the U.S. Trade 
Representative Office to blacklist Taiwan on the special 301 
priority watchlist and over the release of a newsletter in which 
Nintendo accused Taiwan's manufacturers of heavy involvement in 
the production of counterfeit products. (Cai Nian-sen), head of 
the Third Division of the Board of Foreign Trade, pointed out 
that as Nintendo Corporation of America's charge against Taiwan 
is baseless and as Nintendo showed no sincerity in cooperating 
with Taiwan's practicing an export inspection system involving 
Taiwan's computer products, it has to bear the responsibility 
for the serious counterfeiting of its products.

  [Text] Even if the African National Congress [ANC] wins in 
the 27 April general election in South Africa, it cannot simply 
dictate Pretoria's foreign policy. The ANC, which is expected 
to win the first multiracial election in South Africa, has close 
ties with Mainland China. There have been indications that once 
the ANC heads the government, South Africa will switch its 
diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Peking. 
  According to visiting South African Justice Deputy Minister 
Shelia Camerer, the National Party would like to maintain close 
trade links with Taiwan. Since the government will be a 
government of national unity -- a coalition government -- 
Camerer said, the National Party, headed by the president after 
De Klerk, will still be a part of the government. She said the 
National Party will work hard to maintain South Africa's ties 
with the ROC [Republic of China], a position which the party 
will not give up easily. 
  South Africa is the only major country that has maintained 
diplomatic ties with the ROC.

  [Text] Beijing, February 19 (XINHUA) -- China and the 
United States will open the eighth round of talks on the 
restoration of China's signatory party status in the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) here next Monday [21 
February]. 
  A U.S. delegation led by assistant trade representative 
Dorothy Dwoskin will arrive in Beijing on February 20 to pay a 
four-day visit to China at the invitation of the Ministry of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC). 
  During their stay in Beijing, Dorothy and her party will 
talk 
with a Chinese delegation headed by Gu Yongjiang, vice minister 
of foreign trade and economic cooperation, on the restoration of 
China's signatory party status in GATT. 
  This will be the first round of talks between the two 
countries on the issue after the conclusion of the Uruguay Round 
of GATT. 
  An official with MOFTEC said that China attached great 
importance to this round of talks, and will exchange views with 
the U.S. delegation on issues of common concern as well as how 
to accelerate China's re-entry into GATT. 
  The official added that the two-day talks will also make 
preparation for the 16th meeting of the China working party on 
GATT scheduled to be launched in March in Geneva. 
  The first round of Sino-U.S. talks on China's re-entry into 
GATT was held in November, 1986.

central-controlled economy into a market-oriented one. Learning 
how to achieve this transfer is very important for Slovakia, he 
added. 
  He also said that there are great potentials yet to be 
developed in economic relations between the two countries, and 
that he will bring new proposals to China. 
  He said that Chinese entrepreneurs will have opportunities 
to 
invest and get profits in a Slovakia which is undergoing an 
economic privatization process. He also wished that financial 
and monetary exchanges and cooperation with China will attain a 
higher level.

  [Text] Hong Kong, February 18 (XINHUA) -- A senior Chinese 
official here today warned the British side that its 
un-cooperative stance on the Hong Kong issue will by no means 
hold back the progress of the wheel of history. 
  Speaking at a public occasion tonight, NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY 
[XINHUA] Hong Kong branch Director Zhou Nan said that the future 
of Hong Kong is after all in the hands of the great Chinese 
people including Hong Kong compatriots. 
  He reiterated that with the backing of the powerful 
motherland and the support of all the people in the country, we 
will surely overcome all the man-made obstacles on the course of 
progress to secure a smooth transition and guarantee long-term 
stability and prosperity in Hong Kong. 
  Zhou made the above remarks while reviewing the recent 
Sino-British relations in his speech. He said that we sincerely 
hoped that China and Britain could reach an agreement on the 
1994-95 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong on the basis of the 
"three conformities". 
  He said that the Chinese side had made its utmost efforts in 
order to reach an agreement with the British side. 
  However, the good will of the Chinese side and Hong Kong 
compatriots did not come true, he said, adding that the 
responsibility totally lies on the British side. 
  In his speech delivered at tonight's reception party held by 
the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong branch to celebrate the 
Lunar New Year, Zhou Nan also reviewed the recent development of 
the relations between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland. 
  He said that the relationship between the two areas in the 
past year had become ever closer, adding that the booming 
economy of the Chinese mainland had enabled Hong Kong to retain 
its continued economic growth at a fairly high rate. 
  This, he said, had fully revealed that the stability and 
development in the Chinese mainland is the most solid foundation 
for prosperity and stability in Hong Kong. 
  He expressed his firm belief that the economic and trade 
relationship between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, 
together with exchanges and cooperation in the other fields, 
will enter a new stage in the coming new year. 
  Over a thousand people including local public figures from 
all walks of life in the territory such as leading businessmen 
Ann Tse-kai and Henry Fok Ying-tung, both of whom are also 
vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference, attended tonight's grand meeting.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Zou Jiahua Issued Instruction on More </F>
Quickly Expanding the Hengyang Railway Station"] 
  [Text] Up to yesterday, the number of deaths in the 
Hengyang Railway Station tragedy on 15 February increased to 52, 
three more than the 49 deaths reported by MING PAO a few days 
ago. The three seriously wounded people were carried by their 
friends onto a train bound for Guangzhou and died during the 
journey. 
  The 15 February accident was the most serious railway 
accident since the founding of the PRC. 
  Shortly after the accident occurred, Zhu Rongji and Zou 
Jiahua, two vice premiers of the State Council, separately 
inspected the area where the accident occurred. Zou Jiahua went 
to the top floor of Hengyang's Jindu Hotel to look down at the 
railway station. After that, he told the authorities concerned 
to draw a serious lesson from the accident and properly arrange 
the spring passenger transportation every year. He also 
instructed Hengyang to more quickly complete the project of 
transforming and expanding the railway station. 
  After the accident, the investigation group formed by the 
city party committee, the city government, the railway station, 
and the public utilities department reached announced their 
initial conclusions, pointing out that the railway station's 
backward facilities and poor management caused the tragedy. The 
head of the transportation department concerned was detained and 
may be brought to justice. The railway station's party 
secretary, Zhu, and director, Yin, were both dismissed from 
office. Two to three years ago, the Guangzhou Railway Group 
Corporation formulated a plan for transforming the Hengyang 
Railway Station. In order to protect economic returns, however, 
the city party committee, the city government, and the railway 
station kept passing the buck, and the project made very slow 
progress. The city party committee and the city government 
leaders, therefore, had to bear certain responsibility for the 
tragedy. 
  The Hengyang Railway Station was built in the 1950's and 
1960's, and the facilities were rather substantial when it was 
completed. Along with the development of the mainland's reforms 
and opening up and after the economic changes of the past 30 to 
40 years, however, the railway station became rather outdated. 
Over the last few years, a large number of migrant rural 
laborers moved south to seek jobs, and, around the Chinese New 
Year, over 1 million migrant laborers returned home to hold 
family reunions and celebrate the festival. This added huge 
passenger transportation pressure to the Hengyang Railway 
Station. Therefore, expanding the railway station brooks no 
delay. 
  During last year's Spring Festival, this reporter visited 
the 
Hengyang Railway Station and found that, in addition to the 
backward facilities, the railway station was also poorly managed 
and was in a chaotic condition. It was very difficult for 
passengers to buy tickets, and many passengers had to wait one 
or two days standing in line before they could get any. The 
public security officers and military troops responsible for 
maintaining order often took bribes and bought tickets for 
bribe-givers by jumping the line. Last year, this reporter 
witnessed a fight between two groups of security guards and 
policemen. 
  Reportedly, there was also an economic factor behind the 
authorities' unwillingness to immediately expand the railway 
station -- they wanted to earn more money from the crowds of 
migrant laborers. Because a large number of migrant laborers 
were stranded in the railway station before and after the 
Chinese New Year, they had to get accommodation and food and 
might go shopping, and all such consumption would bring 
substantial income to the railway station. 
  After the accident occurred, the authorities sent more 
people 
to work in the railway station, and this shortened the waiting 
period and improved the order, but the railway station's 
economic returns decreased. 
  Some local residents told this reporter that, although the 
tragedy caused heavy casualties and this was unfortunate, the 
accident also had a positive effect, because the authorities 
learned a bloody lesson and decided to speed up the railway 
station's expansion.

  [Text] Nanjing, February 18 (XINHUA) -- State Councillor 
Song Jian stressed here this week that high-tech development 
zones should pay closer attention to commercializing, 
industrializing and internationalizing domestic research results 
while utilizing foreign funds and importing foreign technology. 
  Song, who is also minister in charge of the State Science 
and 
Technology Commission, made these remarks during an eight-day 
tour of Jiangsu Province, East China, which concluded today. 
  Accompanied by Yang Xiaotang, vice-governor of Jiangsu 
Province, Song Jian inspected the high-tech development zones at 
Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou, and some high-tech enterprises in 
Kunshan, Changshu, Zhangjiagang, Jiangyin, Wuxi and Yixing, 
which are all located in the Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou high-tech 
industrial belt. 
  Song said that a high-tech development zone should be 
different from an economic development zone. It should pay more 
attention to apply domestic research results and encourage and 
attract domestic large and medium-sized enterprises, research 
institutes and higher education colleges to establish 
enterprises in it to develop high- tech and new products for 
export. 
  Song noted that at present, China's high-tech industry is 
still in the embryonic stage and high-tech development zones 
should provide the embryonic industry with a base for 
development. 
  Efforts should be made to foster some big enterprise groups 
whose annual production output value would reach one billion to 
10 billion yuan each so that they can compete in the 
international market. 
  He said that it was necessary to attract some people with 
master's degree or a doctorate and some people who have studied 
abroad to work in the leading bodies and administrative bodies 
of high-tech development zones. 
  Remuneration should be divided into different levels, so as 
to improve the rewards for intellectuals, experts and 
management. Those enterprises with high productivity can raise 
the rewards for their workers and staff members before the 
others.

  [Text] Yinchuan, February 20 (XINHUA) -- More than 20 
criminals involved in gang fighting in Xiji County in northwest 
China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region have been punished and put 
behind bars with different imprisonment terms according to law, 
the "NINGXIA DAILY" reported today. 
  Ma Liesun, who was vice-chairman of the Ningxia Regional 
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference (CPPCC) and member of the Standing Committee of the 
CPPCC National Committee before being arrested, was sentenced to 
15 years' imprisonment and deprived of his political rights for 
four years for being guilty of intentional murder and unlawfully 
manufacturing and buying guns and ammunition in plotting gang 
fighting. 
  Ma Fuli, who was associate professor at the Ningxia 
Education 
College before being arrested, was sentenced to life 
imprisonment and deprived of his political rights for life for 
being guilty of intentional murder and unlawfully manufacturing 
guns and ammunition in plotting, organizing and commanding gang 
fighting. 
  Ma Jie, who was a lecturer at the Northwest No. 2 
Nationalities Institute before being arrested, was found guilty 
of intentional murder and unlawfully manufacturing and buying 
guns and ammunition in plotting, organizing and commanding gang 
fighting and was sentenced to 20 years in jail with his 
political rights deprived for five years. 
  And for the same crimes, Ma Rucheng, who was a farmer in 
Xiazhai Township in Xiji County before being arrested, was 
sentenced to life imprisonment with his political rights 
deprived for life. 
  Meanwhile, 18 other criminals were sentenced to three to 14 
years behind bars, and another one was released. 
  The gang fighting case in Xiji County was examined in open 
trial earlier this month by the Guyuan Prefectural Intermediate 
People's Court, which issued verdicts on February 3 and 6. 
  During the given period, the defendants did not appeal to 
the 
higher court and the procuratorial organs did not show 
disagreement with the court's judgments. Accordingly, by 
February 19, the verdicts became effective. 
  It was learned that from May 1992, Ma Liesun, Ma Rucheng, Ma 
Fuli, Ma Jie and others time and again organized gang fighting 
and revenge despite warnings from the local government and 
Communist Party committee. 
  As a result, 49 people died, two are still missing and 
another 30 were injured. 
  To prepare for gang fighting, they were also found 
unlawfully 
manufacturing and buying guns and ammunition. In the end, the 
police confiscated 5,442 guns, of which two were for military 
use, 7,362 bullets, of which 310 were for military use, 21 
self-made cannons and 118 self-made shells and bombs from the 
two sides involved in gang fighting. 
  During the trial, the defendants were found violating the 
criminal law and they pleaded guilty in front of evidences.

  [Text] Beijing, February 22 (XINHUA) -- Wu Yi, Chinese 
minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, said here 
this afternoon that China is ready to show flexibility on some 
issues concerning restoration of China's signatory party status 
in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  She made the remarks when meeting with Assistant Trade 
Representative for GATT Affairs Dorothy Dwoskin from the United 
States, who led a delegation here to attend the eighth round of 
Sino-U.S. talks on China's resumption of its GATT membership. 
  During the meeting with the U.S. delegation following the 
end 
of the two-day talks, Wu said that China has taken a series of 
major steps in reforming its economic and trade system, adding 
that China has made active efforts in its talks with the U.S. 
  "We are ready to show flexibility on some issues of concern 
by signatory parties," she said. However, she added, China 
sticks to the principle of balance between rights and 
obligations required of her before being allowed to re-enter 
GATT. 
  "It is impossible for us to accept excessive demands well 
above the level of China's economic development," she said. 
  Dwoskin expressed appreciation for the measures China has 
taken in reforming its economic and trade system, especially in 
reforming its foreign exchange system. 
  She also reiterated the firm support on the U.S. side for 
the 
resumption of China's signatory party status in GATT, pointing 
out that China should fully observe the obligations as a member 
of a World Trade Organization (WTO). 
  In the eighth round of the talks, both delegations agreed 
that negotiations on China's re-entry into GATT is multi-lateral 
work which demands efforts from all GATT members. 
  They held that this round of negotiations has made full 
preparation and provided a sound basis for the 16th meeting of 
the GATT working party on China, which is scheduled to open in 
Geneva in March, to achieve constructive results. 
  This is the first round of talks between the two countries 
on 
the issue after the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of GATT 
talks. 
  The two delegations exchanged in-depth views on a wide range 
of specific issues concerning China's re-entry into GATT.

<F P=106> [Unattributed "Roundup": "Russia's Mediation Vital to </F>
Settling Bosnian Crisis"] 
  [Text] Moscow, February 21 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Serbs' 
acceptance of Russia's advice to remove their big guns from 
around Sarajevo was a great relief to the world community. 
Russia should be given the greatest credit. 
  On February 9, NATO, while keeping Russia in the dark, sent 
an ultimatum to Bosnian Serbs, requesting them either to 
withdraw heavy weapons from the 20-kilometer exclusion zone or 
face air strikes. 
  Russia promptly responded to NATO's move. Moscow launched a 
strong media offensive against possible NATO air strikes, which 
it said could only help escalate the war and damage the peace 
process. It said NATO had no right to make any decision on the 
Bosnia issue on behalf of the U.N. Security Council. 
  On the other hand, Russia started an all-out diplomatic 
campaign to keep the ultimatum from being materialized. 
President Boris Yeltsin led the mission personally to explain 
to the leaders of the Western countries Russia's proposal: to 
demilitarize Sarajevo and put it under U.N. control. He also 
called for urgent U.N. meeting to cope with the worsening 
situation. 
  On February 17, three days before the deadline, Yeltsin sent 
his special envoy, Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, to 
Sarajevo with his letter. The special envoy promised the ethnic 
Serb forces that Russia will deploy peacekeepers in the Bosnian 
capital. In return, the Serb side agreed to implement the 
ultimatum. 
  The crisis was eased for a while, and everybody sighed a 
breath of relief. 
  Local news media commented favorably on Moscow's mediation, 
describing it as a good show of Russia's independent foreign 
policy, which might help Russia strengthen its position and its 
influence on the world stage. 
  The Balkan region had been a sphere of influence of the 
former Soviet Union. Russia, the legitimate heir of the Soviet 
empire, wants to keep it away from the finger of NATO, its 
flirting friend and hereditary foe. 
  Moreover, if NATO had launched air strikes, it would have 
been its first military action on territories under the tutelage 
of the former Soviet Union. 
  The Russian newspaper "PRAVDA" commented that it would have 
meant that NATO, the overpowering international military group 
of the time, was broadening its sphere of responsibility, and 
that it would harm Russia's strategic interests. 
  From the geopolitical point of view, Russia wants to retain 
its interests in the Balkan region and in the meantime 
strengthen its big-power image in the world. The Russian Army 
newspaper "KRASNAYA ZVEZDA" said that if the West really wants 
peace in the Balkans, it ought to treat Russia as a big power 
and an equal partner. Peace could be achieved in former 
Yugoslavia and Bosnia only when the interests of various sides, 
including Russia, have been taken into careful account, it said. 
  In Russia, political parties and government branches are 
unprecedentedly united in objecting to NATO's air strike threat. 
Yeltsin's tough stance on the issue will surely moderate the 
anti-air strike sentiment at home and strengthen his leadership. 
  Moscow's success in persuading ethnic Serbs to end their 
23-month siege of Sarajevo has pushed one step forward the 
process of politically settling the Bosnia conflict. Kremlin is 
winning in its diplomatic campaign. 
  On February 21, after the deadline passed peacefully, 
Yeltsin 
phoned German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, putting forward three 
major tasks for an ultimate solution to the Bosnia crisis: 
  -- Entrusting Sarajevo to U.N. management; 
  -- Taking measures to strengthen other "security zones" in 
Bosnia; and 
  -- Urging the three warring sides to sign an agreement on a 
peaceful settlement of the conflict. 
  Observers here predict that Russia will seek to play an 
increasingly independent role in the making of peace in the 
war-tattered former Yugoslavia.

  [Text] United Nations, February 20 (XINHUA) -- The 
American U.N. ambassador, Madeleine Albright, said today that 
the first thing NATO countries to do after the ultimatum 
deadline is to make an assessment of the situation about the 
compliance. 
  The ambassador made the remarks this evening when she was 
asked by the CNN about her understanding on U.S. Defense 
Minister William Perry's statement that there would be no air 
strikes against targets in and around Sarajevo on Monday [21 
February]. 
  "My understanding is that Perry said that he was optimistic 
about the direction in which the compliance was moving but he 
also made it very clear that the ultimatum stood and the 
deadline is in fact very clear." 
  She said that they were all encouraged by the pace of 
withdrawal of heavy weaponry from around Sarajevo, as set by the 
NATO ultimatum to be completed by midnight today. 
  The measure of success was not whether there were air 
strikes, she said, it was whether the Serbs had complied. 
  In Washington, a Pentagon official said what Perry had said 
was he was hopeful that there would be no air strikes on Monday, 
CNN reported.

  [Text] Washington, February 18 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. 
Commerce Department has formally lifted its ban against 
U.S.-registered ships and planes transporting goods or traveling 
to Vietnam. 
  The department made the decision Thursday [16 February] in 
response to President Bill Clinton's Feb. 3 move to end the 
19-year-old trade embargo against Vietnam. 
  Clinton said, "I have made the judgment that the best way to 
ensure cooperation from Vietnam and to continue getting the 
information Americans want on POWs and MIAs is to end the trade 
embargo." 
  The U.S. business community has hailed the President's 
decision, saying the move will open up a new venue for American 
goods and investment. 
  The U.S. United Airlines made a decision on February 3 to 
offer flights between Los Angeles and Ho Chi Minh City hours 
after the President announced the lifting of the trade embargo 
on Vietnam. 
  The airlines said it would begin service to Vietnam as soon 
as it could get government approval.

  [Text] Washington, February 22 (XINHUA) -- In what may be 
the most serious espionage case in U.S. history, a senior U.S. 
intelligence officer and his wife were arraigned today for 
spying for the former Soviet Union and later Russia since 1985. 
  President Bill Clinton described the case as a "very serious 
one and would lodge a strong protest with the Russians." 
  Aldrich Hazen Ames, 52, a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) 
employee for more than 31 years, was chief of the Soviet branch 
of the CIA's Counter Intelligence Group, before being arrested 
Monday [21 February] by the Federal Bureau of Investigations 
(FBI). 
  Ames and his wife, the 41-year-old Maria del Rosario Casas, 
allegedly received more than 1.5 million dollars from the former 
Soviet Union's KGB and its Russian successor for giving vital 
information on CIA's operations and personnel. 
  If convicted, the couple could be sentenced a maximum of 
life 
imprisonment and 250,000 dollars in fines. 
  According to Helen F. Fahey, U.S. attorney for the eastern 
district of Virginia, Ames also passed classified information 
to, and received cash from, the Russians through "dead drops" in 
the Washington, D.C. area. 
  A "dead drop" is a prearranged location where a foreign 
agent 
drops off or picks up material from his contact. 
  It is not clear for the time being if any Russian diplomats 
here would be pronounced as "persona non grata" as a result of 
the couple's arrest. 
  Attorney Fehey said in the complaint that Ames and his wife, 
native of Colombia and a naturalized U.S. citizen, used at least 
two Swiss bank accounts to store and transfer the money they got 
from the Russians. 
  The couple spent the money on, among other things, a 540,000 
dollars house, jaguar automobiles and more than 165,000 dollars 
in stocks and securities. 
  FBI agents have seized the couple's residence in Arlington, 
Virginia and frozen numerous bank accounts belonging to or 
controlled by the couple in the United States and abroad. 
  Ames' wife is a part-time student at the Georgetown 
University and previously acted as a paid source for the CIA in 
Mexico City, Mexico. 
  "FBI agents worked doggedly on this case -- not for months 
but for years -- with the CIA's unwavering assistance every stop 
of the way," FBI Director Louis Freeh said.

  [Text] Washington, February 22 (XINHUA) -- The United 
States today lodged a strong protest with Moscow over a Central 
Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer's allegedly spying for the 
former Soviet Union and later Russia since 1985. 
  Secretary of State Warren Christopher summoned Vladimir 
Chkhikvishvili, charge d'affaires of the local Russian Embassy, 
and registered "a formal diplomatic protest over circumstances" 
surrounding the arrest of the former chief of the Soviet Branch 
of the CIA's counter-intelligence group. 
  At the center of the latest diplomatic bickering is Aldrich 
Hazen Ames, 52, who was arrested Monday by the Federal Bureau of 
Investigations (FBI). 
  Christopher "protested the allegations of the Russian 
intelligence service in engaging in the alleged espionage 
activities at issue in this case," State Department Spokesman 
Michael McCurry said in a statement. 
  Clinton has directed National Security Advisor W. Anthony 
and 
others to gauge the damages caused by ames' selling of the CIA's 
vital operations and personnel information to Russia. 
  In Moscow, U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering also "raised 
this 
case with senior Russian officials," McCurry said. 
  A senior administration official was quoted as saying that 
Moscow had been told to take responsibility for the case to 
avoid damaging the U.S.-Russian relationships. 
  Washington was demanding that Russia recall their diplomats 
involved or, the anonymous official said, the U.S. would "take 
the actions ourselves." 
  During the past nine years until his arrest on Monday, the 
Justice Department said, Ames and his 41-year-old wife Maia del 
Rosario Casas received more than 1.5 million dollars from the 
former Soviet Union's KGB and its Russian successor for giving 
vital information on the CIA's operations and personnel. 
  If convicted, the couple could be sentenced a maximum of 
life 
imprisonment and 500,000 dollars in fines. 
  According to Helen F. Fahey, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern 
District of Virginia, Ames also passed classified information 
to, and received cash from, Russians through "dead drops" in the 
Washington, D.C. area. 
  A "dead drop" is a prearranged location where a foreign 
agent 
drops off or picks up material from his contact. 
  It is not clear for the time being if any Russian diplomats 
here would be pronounced as "persona non grata" as a result of 
the couple's arrest. 
  When telephoned for comments on the U.S. protest, a duty 
officer in the local Russian Embassy said nobody from the press 
office was available today. 
  Attorney Fahey said in the complaint that Ames and his wife, 
a native of Colombia and a naturalized U.S. citizen, used at 
least two Swiss bank accounts to store and transfer the money 
they got from the Russians. 
  The couple spent the money on, among other things, a 540,000

Virginia, and frozen numerous bank accounts belonging to or

City, Mexico.

but for years -- with the CIA's unwavering assistance every step

  [Text] Beijing, February 22 (XINHUA) -- The China Great 
Wall Industry Corporation (CGWIC) will launch two high-powered 
direct broadcast satellites for the United States' Echostar 
Satellite Corporation. 
  A contract was signed between the two sides here today. 
  The two satellites are expected to be placed in orbit over 
119 degrees west longitude. The launch of Echostar 1 is slated 
for late summer of 1995 and of Echostar 2, for mid-1996. Both 
satellites will be sent into space from the Xichang satellite 
launch center on China's 2-stage Long March 2e carrier rocket. 
CGWIC will also supply Echostar with a solid motor (epkm) 
[expansion unknown] for each launch. 
  Charlie Ergen, chairman of Echostar, said that the satellite 
manufacturer, Martin Marietta, anticipates receiving required 
satellite export licenses in the near future. 
  Ergen said that a major reason for Echostar's choosing to 
work with CGWIC is that the Long March 2e rocket can ensure a 
minimum life of 17 years for the satellites, a term which can 
not be provided by many Western space companies. In addition, 
CGWIC's competitive price, sincere cooperative spirit and 
experiences in successfully launching overseas satellites were 
also important considerations in making the decision. 
  Echostar 1 and 2 are Martin Marietta Astro Space Series 7000 
satellites, both with 16 transponders. Their successful launch 
would enable Echostar to provide over one hundred channels of 
video, audio and data communications services accessible to 
virtually every single-family household in the continental 
United States utilizing an 18-inch satellite dish. 
  Echostar's home receiver and antenna systems will 
incorporate 
digital compression technology with the potential to deliver 
programming including sports, popular cable services, 
pay-per-view movies, databases, educational services and hdtv 
[high definition television]. 
  At today's contract-signing ceremony, Vice President of 
CGWIC 
Liu Zhixiong said that in the next two years CGWIC will launch 
six overseas satellites. Starting from 1996, CGWIC will launch 
Echostar 2 and a series of iridium satellites for Motorola. At 
present a number of foreign satellite companies are negotiating 
satellite launch arrangements with CGWIC.

<F P=106> ["A Single Voice" column by dissident Wei Jingsheng: "Will </F>
the Wolf Ever See the Lamb's View?"] 
  [Text] Ordinary Americans don't really understand China, 
just as most Chinese don't really understand America. Because 
of this, the people of the two countries often misunderstand the 
actions taken by the government of the other side. Sino-US 
relations have recently been subject to just these kinds of 
misunderstandings. 
  The Chinese government does not believe America really cares 
about the fate of the Chinese people. As Beijing sees it, the 
US is using the human rights issue as an economic bargaining 
chip and a political tactic for attacking the Chinese Communist 
Party. 
  As a result, the Chinese government tries to deal with human 
rights as a problem in foreign relations. Its main rationale 
for resisting the mounting international pressure is that 
"interference in China's domestic politics is unacceptable". 
There is a tendency to treat political dissidents as human 
pawns in China-US trade negotiations. Beijing participates in 
this sordid trade because it does not understand US thinking. 
  Beijing does not believe the US will actually refuse to deal 
with the Chinese government because of human rights. Beijing 
does not believe the Americans are really willing to forego a 
chance to make some quick money, or that the Americans are 
applying these same moral judgments impartially to the policies 
of other countries. 
  Though perfectly well aware their own behaviour is wrong, 
Beijing's leaders are determined to hold out until the last 
minute in the belief that this will allow them to recover 
"face". In time, they believe, the "Yankees" will reveal the 
reality behind their feigned concern for human rights. This 
will result in greater freedom for the Chinese communist 
government--all the better to strip more freedoms from ordinary 
people. 
  It appears the US government also misunderstands the real 
thinking of the Chinese government. US leaders have the 
impression that the Chinese leadership are like the dimwitted, 
obtuse rulers of a backward people who do not understand that 
violating human rights is actually wrong. As a result, the 
Americans are considering abandoning the strategy of steadily 
increasing pressure on China and relying instead on "persuasion 
and education" in order to improve China's human rights. This 
is like Aesop's fable about the lamb that tried to reason with a 
wolf. 
  I fear any attempt to use reason and logic in this situation 
will prove abortive. It's not that the wolf doesn't understand 
reason, but rather that he isn't interested in discussing reason. 
  I'm not sure whether the American people understand the way 
the Sino-US relationship is changing, but the Chinese people's 
understanding of their own government is very clear. Before the 
communists took power, they were the group which clamoured most 
enthusiastically for human rights and democracy. It is 
impossible that they do not understand these concepts. But 
their autocratic rule has given them excessive power and they 
have no interest in honouring the promises they made to the 
masses. 
  The Chinese people's understanding of the US government's 
position, on the other hand, is not necessarily correct. The 
real effect of America's new China policies has been to convince 
the Chinese people that the image of the US the communist 
leadership has peddled to them for all these years is correct. 
The line is that the US government is a rich man's government 
controlled by capitalists and that--like the Japanese--the 
Americans do not care about violating their consciences to make 
a quick buck. 
  I do not believe this is the case, or rather I do not want 
to 
believe it. But when people disdainfully equate the democratic 
system of the United States with Japan's plutocratic system, 
what evidence can I offer against it?

  [Text] Talks on resolving the differences between Britain 
and China on financing the new airport will resume "very soon," 
according to the Chinese side. 
  China's chief representative on the Sino-British Joint 
Liaison Group, Guo Fengmin, said the two sides would set the 
date for the meeting next week. 
  Speaking at the Xinhua News Agency local office Lunar New 
Year banquet yesterday, Mr Guo said it would be difficult to 
hold the Airport Committee talks next week. 
  "There will be expert talks on security and defence land 
next 
week, and it would be difficult to hold the two sets of talks 
simultaneously," he said. 
  He said the date for resuming the Airport Committee talks 
would be arranged by the time the two sides' experts met next 
week. 
  The Chinese representative on the security and defence land 
committee, Luo Jiahuan, said he hoped next week's talks would 
lead to an agreement. "Although the issues are very complicated, 
there is still hope of reaching a resolution," Mr Luo said. 
  He was not sure if the British side would be able to resolve 
the differences. 
  He said the main argument would be on the garrison and 
redevelopment. 
  It was proposed that the British military hospital in Tsim 
Sha Tsui would be scaled down and Shek Kong garrison would be 
redeveloped. 
  Mr Luo said the Chinese and British sides would arrange a 
joint tour to the sites next week. 
  Meanwhile, another new airport contract has been awarded, 
despite the Sino-British impasse over funding. 
  The Provisional Airport Authority yesterday announced it had 
awarded the contract for the airport's baggage handling system 
to Swire Engineering Services, in conjunction with Van Der Lande 
Industries of the Netherlands and Siemens of Germany. 
  A political party yesterday urged the government to make 
contingency plans to relieve traffic in Kowloon in case the 
airport railway link was not completed by 1997. 
  "It seems to us the government is very optimistic about the 
financial arrangement and thinks that the railway will be 
completed," Leung Kwong-cheung of the Association for Democracy 
and People's Livelihood (ADPL) said. 
  "It (the government) says it has no special plans as it is 
optimistic." 
  But Mr Leung said in case the railway could not be completed 
as scheduled, the government should now start preparing measures 
to cope with extra transport demands in West Kowloon, Tsing Yi 
and the future No 3 route after the airport opened in 1997. 
  At a meeting with Principal Assistant Secretary for 
Transport 
Arthur Ng, the ADPL proposed four contingency plans, including 
extending the Kowloon-Canton Railway to Central.

  [Text] Yesterday, Guo Fengmin, chief Chinese 
representative China to the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group 
[JLG], pointed out that when the Sino-British talks on the 
arrangements for Hong Kong's 1994/95 elections began, it was 
made clear that the contents of the talks were confidential. If 
the British side unilaterally publicizes the content of the 
talks, the Chinese side will naturally take action accordingly. 
  Guo Fengmin made the above remarks when asked by a reporter 
what reaction the Chinese side will take if the British side 
publicizes the contents of talks at a spring party hosted by the 
Island Office [Hong Kong Island] of XINHUA News Agency Hong Kong 
Branch yesterday evening. 
  Guo Fengmin said: When China and Britain started the talks, 
they laid down the rule that the contents would be kept 
confidential. If the British side now takes unilateral action, 
the Chinese side of course will react accordingly. As to what 
reaction will be taken Guo Fengmin hopes the public will "wait 
and see." 
  Besides, Guo Fengmin also said that according to the 
provisions of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, at least three 
JLG meetings should be held each year. "I think there will be 
three meetings this year." He pointed out that there will be a 
experts panel meeting on the use of military land this week, 
after which other expert panel meetings will be considered.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus" page: "Perspective" column by Deputy </F>
Editor Terry Cheng: Beijing, London Must Allow Political Elite 
To Emerge"] 
  [Text] One of the most urgent issues facing Hong Kong's 
transition to Chinese sovereignty is to establish a political 
elite which commands the support and respect of the majority of 
the local people. Unfortunately, the reform package by Governor 
Chris Patten has further polarised the elite and the society, 
already split over the attitude towards Beijing. 
  Among local people, there have always been suspicions, 
resentments and fears against the communist rulers on the 
mainland due to political turmoil there. Military suppression 
of student-led demonstrations on 4 June, 1989, was the latest of 
these political turmoils. But the crackdown occurred at a 
particularly sensitive time to Hong Kong people as 1997 was only 
several years away, and it came after 10 years of reform and 
opening. 
  Before Mr Patten proposed his reform package in October 
1992, 
Hong Kong society and its political elite had somewhat contained 
their polarisation from the 4 June trauma. But in the course of 
the row over the political system triggered by the governor's 
move, public figures have had to take sides. And the political 
dispute has spilled over into other areas, such as the financial 
arrangement of the new airport. As a result, the society and 
elite have become further split. 
  Now both the Chinese and British are trying hard to woo Hong 
Kong people to their sides. As Beijing is stepping up to set up 
the "second stove" here, it is inviting new batches of people to 
become advisers to the territory-wide and regional affairs. On 
the part of the British, they are trying to hold people on their 
side. In this tug-of-war, people have to choose camps and risk 
being labelled as pro-Beijing or pro-London. 
  One of the most disturbed sectors is the civil service which 
should continue to play a crucial role in the government of the 
future Special Administrative Region. Beijing has taken to task 
some of the senior officials who have fervently promoted the 
governor's package. It is believed that the Chinese side is 
close to determining that certain Hong Kong officials will not 
serve beyond 1997. This will cost the territory some of its 
most capable hands. But as every government gives top priority 
to political reliability among its senior members, the Chinese 
side's stance is quite understandable. In this regard, Anson 
Chan, the first local to become Hong Kong's chief secretary, is 
likely to lose her top job after 1997. Mrs Chan probably knows 
this. In a recent interview with the HONGKONG STANDARD, she 
cast doubts about her own political future, saying she would 
find it difficult to preside over arrangements if China 
dismantled Hong Kong's three tiers government in 1997. Here, 
the chief secretary was actually saying that she could not 
continue her civil service career because of the political 
changes. 
  The fact remains that because of the row triggered by Mr 
Patten's package, the Chinese and British can't agree on 
political arrangements. The inability to establish a political 
elite which commands the support and respect of the majority of 
the local people will be harmful to the implementation of 
Beijing's pledge of "Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong". This 
may jeopardise the "one country two systems" scheme which needs 
local people to prop up Hong Kong's system of capitalism. In 
the worst scenario, the polarisation may lead to instability in 
the years leading up to, as well as the years after, transition. 
We need local people to be in responsible positions in every 
major sector so that after the British withdrawal, the local 
administration can still operate effectively and stability will 
be maintained. If we cannot do that, we risk the danger of 
Beijing sending the mainland cadres to help run the 
administration. This is a development which the local people do 
not want to see. 
  Much has to be done to redress the situation. Ideally, the 
Chinese and British sides should confine their clashes and 
prevent further splitting the society and its political elite. 
The two sides should stop politicising the civil service. The 
Chinese side should understand that since the officials are 
still under the British administration, they should by and large 
follow London's line. Let the civil servants perform their 
duties as usual. Actually, the society as a whole should be 
allowed to do its business as usual. If the governments of 
China and Britain and local political groups concerned 
themselves more with livelihood rather than political issues, 
Hong Kong would have a smoother transition. It would also be 
easier for a political elite, which commanded the support and 
respect of the majority of the local people, to emerge.

  [Text] More than one-third of senior civil servants will 
resign because of the change to Chinese sovereignty, according 
to a survey released yesterday. It also disclosed that up to 77 
per cent held foreign passports, increasing fears that an exodus 
of top officials is likely near the change-over. 
  The survey, conducted by Professor Joseph Cheng Yu-shek and 
Dr Jane Lee of the City Polytechnic, showed strong pessimism 
among the cream of the 1 90,000-strong civil service. As many 
as 35 per cent of the top-ranking officials said they would not 
remain in the civil service after 1997. And another 29 per cent 
said they were undecided whether they would continue to serve 
after that date. The survey was conducted between March and 
November and targeted about 1,000 most senior level staff. It 
contained interviews and was followed by a mailed survey with a 
response rate of 57 per cent. 
  "In the study, it is observed that the bureaucrats generally 
exhibit a strong sense of uncertainty and pessimism concerning 
their future career as well as their political role," the 
academics said in their paper. "Early retirement and 
resignation from the civil service may be the ways by which the 
bureaucrats express their negative feelings towards the future 
political system." 
  The survey showed that up to 37 per cent of respondents were 
pessimistic about their career. Among these, 13 per cent said 
they were "very worried", while the remaining 24 per cent were 
worried". The senior officials were also disturbed by the 
increasing interference by China in the run-up towards 1997. 
Twenty-one per cent said they were "very worried" about the 
involvement of Beijing government officials in Hong Kong's major 
policy decisions. And nearly half (46.9 per cent) of the 
respondents said they were "fairly worried" about China's 
involvement, compared with the 25.5 per cent who were "fairly 
unworried". Also, more than half (50.9 per cent) disagreed that 
the decisions of the Chinese Government should override those of 
the Hong Kong Government. More than 65 per cent of the 
respondents said they were holding full British passports, with 
another 11 per cent holding other foreign passports. 
  The survey found that a majority of the respondents agreed 
that the Government should be held accountable to the 
Legislative Council, compared with the 17.1 per cent who said 
the Government should be held accountable to the Chinese 
Government. This was despite the fact that many of those 
interviewed felt that politicians were "incompetent, senseless 
and inimical to the general interests". "The study finds that 
the bureaucrats are in the process of adjustment towards a more 
open and responsive government," the researchers said.

  [Text] The Immigration Department is facing crisis delays 
in phase two of its application procedures for British National 
Overseas (BNO) passports. With only 30 working days left until 
the cut-off date for applications, 250,000 of the 340,000 
eligible applicants have failed to lodge the necessary 
paperwork. Immigration Department assistant director, Chan 
Ching-bor, said more than 8,000 applications would have to be 
lodged every day before March 31 if people were to change their 
travel documents from British Dependent Territories Citizen to 
BNO passports in time. He said the outstanding applications 
would far exceed the capacity of staff processing claims for BNO 
passports. Only 3,500 applications can be processed per day. 
We would obviously like more staff to process these 
applications, but we just can't get the approval for funding." 
  Mr Chan urgently appealed for everyone eligible in phase two 
(those born from 1962 to 1966) to send in their applications. 
"It is only a two-page form and the best way is to post it to 
the Immigration Department. I urge everyone to act as quickly 
as possible on this," he said. 
  Mr Chan was unable to explain the delay in the procedure. 
"Phase two just seems to have been much slower than phase one." 
In phase one, 1,500 late applications were received and of the 
150 so far processed, all have satisfied the requirements and 
been confirmed for BNO passports. He said about 10 per cent of 
eligible applicants would probably not apply for BNO passports 
for a variety of reasons. "Some may have emigrated, may be 
living in countries that don't allow dual nationalities, or are 
people who don't think they will need such a passport after 
1997." 
  The phased programme for application is intended to help the 
3.5 million British Dependent Territories citizens in Hong Kong 
to retain British nationality by having a BNO passport valid 
beyond 1997. The programme aims to enable an orderly flow of 
applications. Those who fail to apply before the designated 
deadlines may lose their British nationality unless they have 
special reasons for their late applications. There have been 
complaints from people living overseas that they could not 
register in time because of difficulties in getting the right 
forms in embassies. Mr Chan said any late application would be 
assessed on the reasons provided by the applicant as to why it 
was lodged late.

  [Text] Mainland political dissident Han Dongfang has taken 
his first step towards establishing himself in Hong Kong, by 
taking a job. Yesterday the Hong Kong Christian Industrial 
Committee (CIC) announced Han had accepted a job for a year as a 
staff researcher, with a salary of about $10,000 a month. The 
committee said Han would be responsible for "research in trade 
unionism in support of CIC's long-standing programme of trade 
union education and the promotion of solidarity among workers in 
different parts of the world". The committee said Han's proven 
commitment to the labour movement and his Christian beliefs made 
him a valued addition to its staff. 
  Han led protests by nonofficial labour unions in Beijing 
during the stormy run-up to the violent government crackdown on 
June 4, 1989. After spending nearly a year in prison, he was 
allowed to leave China with his wife, to seek medical treatment 
in the United States in September 1992, for tuberculosis. In 
August Han attempted to return to China through Hong Kong, but 
was turned away by Chinese authorities. Subsequent attempts to 
go back have also failed. Han has remained in Hong Kong on a 
special one-month renewable visa for more than six months. A 
legislative councillor, Lau Chin-shek, and the director of Asia 
Watch, Robin Munro, have been his main supporters. Han says 
Hong Kong will be his base for now, as he continues his work for 
the Chinese labour movement. 
  A friend of Han's in Hong Kong said the committee would not 
forbid Han from making further attempts to return to China. Han 
applied for a work visa before the lunar new year, and was 
granted one on Monday. His wife and one-year-old son remain in 
the US. Han has no immediate plans to apply for them to come to 
Hong Kong.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" by Political Editor Chip Tsao and Sally Blyth] </F>
  [Text] Public opinion is almost equally divided over 
whether even the less controversial parts of Chris Patten's 
reform bill should be amended, a poll conducted for Eastern 
Express shows. The poll, prepared in time for today's 
Legislative Council [Legco] debate on the bill, casts doubt on 
claims by the Governor to have widespread support for his 
political reforms. Conducted on Monday and released yesterday, 
the poll also shows an overwhelming majority of people -- 78.8 
per cent -- either know "very little" or nothing at all about 
the bill before Legco today. According to the poll, a small 
majority of people support the retention of ex-officio seats in 
the Legislative Council for members of the Urban and Regional 
Councils and the district boards. 
  Yesterday the Executive Council gave the go-ahead for the 
publication of the second and more controversial stage of the 
political reform legislation. The bill, designed to widen the 
franchise, will be gazetted on Friday. 
  The first stage of the reforms, covering the less 
contentious 
issues, paves the way for the lowering of the voting age to 18, 
the scrapping of appointed seats on the district boards and the 
establishment of the single-seat single-vote system for the 
municipal and Legislative Council elections. This is expected 
to be passed into law today. 
  Legislators are braced for a marathon debate, likely to last 
late into the night. The Government is confident that any 
attempt by conservative forces to derail the bill will be 
defeated. According to today's Oriental Daily News [TUNG FANG 
JIH PAO], 256 district board councillors out of a total of 411 
are pressing the Governor to withdraw the bill from Legco. 
  Despite the vigour of the politicians' interest, the Eastern 
Express poll, undertaken by the Social Sciences Research Centre 
of the University of Hong Kong, shows most people have either 
lost interest, or have never been interested in the political 
reforms. Only 12.1 percent said they were either very clear or 
resonably clear about what was going on. The survey shows that 
neither of the amendments proposed by Liberal Party and the 
United Democrats has been well received by public. Only 21 
percent of those questioned agreed with the Liberal Party's 
amendment that arrangements for the 1995 Legco election should 
not be included in the bill, compared with 35.9 percent who did 
not agree. Only 32 percent supported the United Democrats' 
amendment to abolish all appointed or ex-officio seats of the 
Regional Council and district boards, compared with 38.8 percent 
who did not. There was an even split of opinion over the 
amendment raised by one legislator, Eric Li, who favoured a 
fixed ratio of one appointed seat to every three elected seats 
in the Urban and Regional councils and district boards. 
Fractionally more people supported than opposed the tabling and 
passage of the original version of the reform bill as proposed 
by Patten in autumn 1992 -- 27.6 percent against 26.9 percent. 
  According to Robert Chung, the research officer in charge of 
the survey, none of the bill's proposals commanded the support 
of more than half of those questioned. "It shows an 
overwhelming indifference by the public with what's going on 
between Beijing and the Governor," Chung said. "Most of those 
interviewed have either shown no interest or no opinion at all." 
The poll provides further evidence of an erosion in public 
support for political reform compared with the high ratings for 
it seen after the measures were introduced by the Governor in 
1992. 
  The Executive Council [Exco] yesterday endorsed the 
disclosure tomorrow of the Foreign Office's account of the 17 
rounds of fruitless talks with China on political reform. The 
disclosure will take the form of a United Kingdom White Paper. 
Yesterday, Zhang Junsheng, the deputy director of the New China 
News Agency (Xinhua), said China had never objected to the 
publication but stressed that it had to be done through 
diplomatic channels. Although Exco has approved publication, 
the final decision rests with Douglas Hurd, the Foreign 
Secretary. 
  There has been disagreement over whether the second 
political 
bill should be published in their original form or watered down 
as an olive branch to China.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Second Best Just Not Good Enough] </F>
  [Text] The moment of truth has finally arrived. Almost a 
year and a half after Governor Chris Patten outlined his plans 
for political reform, the Legislative Council [Legco] is faced 
with a real decision about whether to turn these reforms into 
law. It would be a great pity if the decision is stalled once 
again by the procedural manoeuvre which Councillor Elsie Tu has 
in mind. Tu, a bitter opponent of the Governor and his reform 
plans, is thinking about asking today's council meeting to 
postpone discussion of the first stage of the reform bill. She 
has every right to oppose, or indeed, amend the bill but she has 
no real grounds for suggesting yet another postponement of 
legislation. The uncertainty which swirls around the proposals 
must be brought to an end. Legco has a duty to not only pass 
legislation on the first stage of the reform bill but also on 
the more controversial second stage which contains plans for 
enlarging the franchise. 
  When the reforms were first proposed they appeared to 
command 
widespread public support. That, at any rate, was the verdict 
of countless public opinion polls. A significant new poll, 
published in today's paper, shows that support is ebbing. 
Opinion is now evenly divided on even the modest reforms under 
discussion in Legco today. We do not suggest that every new 
opinion poll should cause the Governor to dash out and alter his 
plans, nor that the members of Legco should respond like 
Pavlov's dogs to every new poll finding. 
  However, there are clear indications that support for reform 
is eroding. The reasons are probably complex but China's 
campaign of opposition is evidently having some effect. 
Previous polls have shown that even those who support the idea 
of more democracy as a matter of principle are reluctant to see 
it expanded in Hong Kong in the face of Chinese resistance. We 
can understand a reluctance to foster confrontation and 
increasingly sympathise with the Government's efforts to try to 
achieve a negotiated agreement with China, even though the 
negotiations disintegrated into something close to farce. 
  Nevertheless, the case for reform remains strong and the 
need 
for legislation to provide a framework for the coming elections 
is pressing. Our poll shows the Governor still has support for 
going ahead with plans for the 1995 Legco elections. However, a 
small majority of those questioned believe in the retention of 
ex-officio seats for members of the Regional Council [Regco] and 
the district boards and opinion is evenly divided on the idea of 
maintaining appointed seats in Legco. We find the reluctance to 
dispense with appointed seats particularly bizarre because even 
the Basic Law decreed that appointment to the legislature must 
end. We are also sceptical about the virtues of small cabals 
being empowered to elect members through Regco and district 
boards. In sum, it is hard to find much which is really 
objectionable in the bill before Legco today and we see few 
merits in the amendments being advanced. Yet it cannot be 
denied that the appetite for reform is fading. 
  If the public really want an electoral system riddled with 
undemocratic and unrepresentative practices, they are quite 
entitled to have precisely such a system. If they have taken 
the apparently pragmatic view that this is the best that can be 
achieved, given China's views on the subject, their assessment 
is reasonable. However, there comes a time when principles 
should be given precedence above pragmatism. People who pride 
themselves on their pragmatic views of affairs tend to see 
history as static. They argue that the realities of today will 
be the realities of tomorrow. History rarely works out quite 
like that. Chinese history, with its violent lurches from 
regime to regime, is a perfect illustration of this point. It 
therefore seems more realistic to start from a point of 
principle and work backwards from there. If it is right for 
Hong Kong to join other modern societies in having the ability 
to elect its law-makers in a fair and representative way, then 
Hong Kong should try to achieve such a system of elections. To 
settle for less is to accept that the territory should always 
settle for second best. Second best is not the Hong Kong way of 
doing things, nor should it become so.

  [Text] Guangdong's dream of becoming the fifth Asian 
economic dragon is inseparable from Hong Kong's prosperity, the 
province's Communist Party secretary, Xie Fei, said last night. 
Mr Xie underscored the close ties between the two neighbours 
after meeting a group of Hong Kong delegates to the Guangdong 
People's Congress. 
  But he stopped short of suggesting any high-level visits 
between the two governments to boost co-operation. Such visits 
have been seen as politically sensitive since Governor Chris 
Patten tabled his political reform package to the legislature. 
  In addressing the delegates, the party official gave an 
account of Guangdong's development blueprint from 1990 to 2010 
and admitted that the future might not be all that rosy. 
According to Mr Xie, Guangdong will have to establish a market 
economy, perfect its legal system, and improve its present 
people's congress system and anti- corruption work in the coming 
six years. "My view is that our targets in the first 10 years 
(1990 to 2000) are relatively easy to achieve but difficulties 
await us in the second (decade). "That's why we have to lay a 
very solid foundation... now." He said that Guangdong would 
pay extra attention to the development of agriculture, basic 
infrastructure and education, and science and technology in the 
run-up to 2000. 
  Meanwhile, the Government hopes to adjust the province's 
industry mix, clean up the environment and control population 
growth in that period. "Whether we can succeed in the second 10 
years will very much depend on how we fare in these areas," Mr 
Xie said. 
  He highlighted the role of Hong Kong in Guangdong's 
ambitious 
plans. "The realisation of these targets is closely linked with 
the prosperity of Hong Kong and Macao," he said. The territory 
could continue to contribute to Guangdong's economy by serving 
as a channel for "investment markets, management know how, and 
information."

  [Text] Beijing, 20 Feb (XINHUA) -- Vientiane: Lao President 
Nouhak Phoumsavan said on 18 February that the Lao party and 
Government are satisfied with the all-round, in-depth 
development of friendly and cooperative relations between the 
Lao and Chinese parties and countries. 
  He made the statement here in a meeting with outgoing 
Chinese 
ambassador Huang Guocai. 
  Nouhak pointed out: Lao and Chinese leaders have maintained 
close contacts with each other in recent years. Delegations 
from various departments at different levels have frequently 
visited each other. This has improved mutual trust and 
friendship. Cooperation in the economic and cultural fields 
have also developed rapidly and produced gratifying results. 
  He said: The two countries have satisfactorily resolved the 
border issue left over from history in a very short period. 
They have successively signed the "Sino-Lao Border Treaty" and 
the "Sino-Lao Border System Treaty." This has not only laid a 
stronger foundation for the good-neighborly and friendly 
relationship between the two countries but also established a 
model for peacefully resolving disputes between countries in 
this region. 
  Nouhak said: The Lao party and government follow with great 
interest the splendid achievements of China's in-depth reform 
and expanded opening up. They are pleased to see that China is 
more stable politically and socially, its economy prospers with 
each passing day, and its people's living standards further 
improve. He wished the Chinese people, under the leadership of 
the CPC headed by General Secretary Jiang Zemin, achieve even 
greater victories in building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics.

  [Text] Singapore, February 22 (XINHUA) -- Lee Kuan Yew, 
senior minister of Singapore will sign the agreement on 
development and transfer Singapore software to Suzhou industrial 
township. 
  Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and Chinese Premier 
Li 
Peng will attend the signing ceremony at the weekend. 
  Lee said that the prospects of the Suzhou project are 
"good", 
"a well planned township in Suzhou will proceed at a slower pace 
than Shenzhen, but the long-term results will be better." 
  His remarks were contained in an written interview with 
XINHUA here today. 
  Asked why Singapore chose Suzhou as the venue of the joint 
government project, Lee said because it is in the Chang Jiang 
delta and close to Shanghai, the dragon's head of the Chang 
Jiang valley. "It is a medium-size township, smaller than 
Singapore, and therefore its scale of work is what Singapore 
officials have handled before." 
  He underlined that the main feature of the project "will be 
on long term planning which takes into account the environment, 
aesthetics, the convenience of the residents who will live and 
work in it, and of the commercial and financial services that 
will cater to the industries and the residents." 
  In the Singapore-Suzhou industrial township, he said that 
industrial, residential and commercial facilities would be 
planned, implemented and administered as one integrated whole, 
as in Jurong town in Singapore. 
  Lee Kuan Yew is the initiator of the Suzhou project, which 
has been supported by the Chinese Government. Singapore will 
develop a industrial town with an area of 70 sq kilometres in 
Suzhou in the next 10-15 years and will transfer Singapore 
economic development and management experiences to Suzhou. 
  On "software", he said the hardware is the "tangibles", what 
people can see and feel in buildings, roads and physical 
infrastructure. But the software is "intangibles", which 
includes: drawing up and implementation of the plans, management 
of the township as well as creation of conditions which are 
attractive to investors and favorable to residents. 
  He also saw some difficulties in the procedures. "The 
difficulties lie in transferring the methods developed in 
Singapore into Suzhou, because these methods have to be adapted 
to fit into the system in China. Therefore Suzhou, Jiangsu and 
Beijing officials have to encourage creative adjustments and 
adaptations." 
  "It is like bud-grafting Singapore methods of urban and 
social organization on to a Chinese tree with roots in Chinese 
soil," he said. 
  Lee will leave here on February 24 to visit Beijing and 
Tianjin.

  [Text] Beijing, 23 Feb (XINHUA) -- While meeting with Nong 
Duc Manh, chairman of the National Assembly of Vietnam, this 
morning at Zhongnanhai, President Jiang Zemin expressed the 
belief that the China-Vietnam good-neighborly, friendly, and 
mutually-cooperative relationship will surely keep on developing 
on the basis of the five principles of peaceful co-existence. 
  The Nong Duc Manh-led Vietnamese National Assembly 
delegation 
is the first delegation of Vietnam's National Assembly to visit 
China since the normalization of diplomatic relations between 
China and Vietnam. Jiang Zemin welcomed the visit of Nong Duc 
Manh and his party. 
  Jiang Zemin said that the Sino-Vietnamese relationship has 
seen great development in recent years and that there have been 
frequent high-level exchanges between the two countries. During 
the recent visit of Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh to China, 
both sides exchanged views on bilateral relations and on 
international and regional issues and reached common 
understanding over many major issues. 
  Jiang Zemin added that further consolidation and enhancement 
of the good-neighborly, friendly, and mutually-cooperative 
relationship is not only in accord with the fundamental 
interests of the two countries and peoples, but also will be 
conducive to peace, stability, and development in the region. 
  During the meeting, Nong Duc Manh briefed Jiang Zemin on 
Vietnam's socio-economic development. He said as Vietnam is 
implementing the policy of reform and opening up, Vietnam can 
borrow from China's many successful experiences in the areas of 
reform and opening up. 
  Jiang Zemin also gave a short briefing to the Vietnamese 
guests on China's reform, opening up, and on building a 
socialist market economy. 
  During the meeting, Nong Duc Manh conveyed greetings to 
President Jiang Zemin from Do Muoi, general secretary of the 
Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee; President Le Duc 
Anh; and Premier Vo Van Kiet. Jiang Zemin asked Nong Duc Manh 
to convey his greetings to General Secretary Do Muoi, President 
Le Duc Anh, and Premier Vo Van Kiet. 
  Wang Hanbin, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the 
National People's Congress, was present at the meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, February 22 (XINHUA) -- China owes its 
stability and development to the reform and open policy that has 
been implemented over the past 15 years, top Chinese legislator 
Qiao Shi said here today. 
  Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National 
People's Congress (NPC) of China, made these remarks when he met 
with Nong Duc Manh, chairman of the National Assembly of 
Vietnam, here this afternoon. 
  Nong and his party arrived in China February 21 as guests of 
NPC's Standing Committee. This is the first Vietnamese 
parliamentary delegation to visit China after the normalization 
of ties between the two countries. 
  Qiao Shi appreciated the increasing exchange of visits by 
leaders of the two countries and the growing bilateral 
cooperation in political, economic and other spheres since the 
normalization of relations between the two countries, saying 
that that has laid a good foundation for the two countries to 
further their cooperation. 
  Qiao told the Vietnamese guest that political and social 
stability and economic development have enabled China to stand 
the tests of the drastically changing international situation. 
  The experience of Western countries in economic development 
is the creation of working peoples and is a common treasure of 
all mankind, Qiao said. "We should study these experiences and 
absorb those best suited to China's actual conditions." 
  Nong expressed the hope that the visit would enhance the 
mutual understanding and friendship between the people of the 
two countries and help to usher in a new phase of friendly 
cooperation between Vietnamese National Assembly and China's NPC. 
  "We would like to know more about China's reform and opening 
and further bilateral economic cooperation," he said. 
  With Vietnam now undergoing reforms, its National Assembly 
is 
faced with the heavy task of passing new laws, Nong said. 
  China's NPC has accumulated a lot of experience in this 
regard, which is worth learning, he said. 
  He suggested that the two parliaments should enhance their 
exchanges, especially the cooperation and exchanges between the 
two sides' special committees. 
  NPC Vice-Chairman Wang Hanbin was present at today's 
meeting.

  During his formal talks with Pakistan Foreign Minister 
Sardar 
Asif Ahmad Ali here today, Qian expressed the hope that Pakistan 
and India would make progress in resolving the Kashmir issue 
through dialogs.

  Pakistan Foreign Minister Asif briefed the Chinese guest 
about the Kashmir situation and Pakistan's efforts to bring

relations are sound and have made progress in all fields. 
  He expressed the hope that the two countries would further 
develop the friendly and mutually beneficial relations. 
  Qian Qichen said Sino-Pak friendship is time-tested and the 
bilateral relations have seen all-round development since the 
two countries established diplomatic ties over 40 years ago. 
  Such friendship is not only in the interests of the two 
countries but also conducive to the maintenance of peace and 
stability in this region and Asia as a whole, Qian said. 
  The two sides also exchanged views on mutually beneficial 
cooperation in all fields, on regional security and economic 
cooperation as well as on the international situation. 
  Qian also appreciated Pakistan's efforts for settling 
difference among various Afghan parties to restore peace and 
stability in war-torn Afghanistan.

Senate President Rene Monory here today, expressed the hope that 
Sino-French ties would be further developed. 
  Rong said that although there were at one time setbacks, 
Sino-French relations have been on a normal track in general 
since the two countries set up diplomatic ties 30 years ago. 
  He hoped that the two countries' relations will be further 
bolstered on the basis of non-interference in each other's 
internal affairs, mutual respect and mutual benefit. 
  Monory visited China in 1987 when he was French education 
minister. He said his current China tour is to strengthen the 
friendship and mutual understanding between the two countries. 
  The French Senate president also expressed the belief that 
the cooperation between the two countries will be enhanced. 
  Rong noted that the upcoming China visit by French Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur is very important in the development 
of Sino-French ties. 
  Monory said: "The new French Government is quite aware of 
the 
importance of its relations with China and Prime Minister 
Balladur attaches great importance to the cooperation with 
China." 
  He added: "I hope his China tour will be a success." 
  Chen Muhua, vice-chairperson of the Standing Committee of 
the 
Chinese National People's Congress, was present in the meeting.

  [Text] Pale, February 22 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic said today that Serbs want to achieve final 
peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina through political negotiations. 
  In an exclusive interview with XINHUA, he said that if the 
ceasefire accord between Serbs and Muslims is carefully observed 
by the warring sides, the 22-month-old civil war will come to an 
end "within four or five months". 
  The ceasefire accord was signed soon after the NATO 
ultimatum 
issued on February 9, following the bombing of a crowded 
Sarajevo marketplace on February 5, killing 68 people and 
injuring over 200. 
  Karadzic said the bloodshed in Sarajevo has damaged the 
process of peace talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. 
  Meanwhile, he accused NATO of issuing the ultimatum and 
threatening air strikes against Serb positions, saying that the 
West is playing power politics toward small nations by showing 
off their military forces. 
  Karadzic said the Bosnian war could be ended if the 
international community treats all sides equally. 
  He thanked the Chinese government for opposing foreign 
military intervention in Bosnia-Hercegovina and insisting on a 
political resolution to the conflict. 
  Karadzic said the three ethnics (Serbs, Croats and Muslims) 
would be good neighbors provided they become separate states. 
He added that the relations between Serbs and Croats "are good 
now". 
  He urged the United States and Germany to exert pressure on 
Muslims so that "a genuine peace can finally come". 
  The Bosnian war has so far claimed 200,000 lives and 
produced 
millions of refugees. The war has also inflicted heavy blows to 
the economy in the former Yugoslavia.

"Before the Deadline of NATO Ultimatum"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 19 Feb (XINHUA) -- As NATO's ultimatum to 
all warring parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina reaches the countdown 
moment, subtle changes have emerged in the stand of all 
Bosnian-Herzegovinan conflicting parties and relevant countries. 
  Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina on 17 February began massive 
removal of cannons and other heavy weaponry from Sarajevo. At a 
meeting with UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi on 18 February, 
Serbian leader Karadzic assured Akashi that the heavy weapons 
deployed around Sarajevo will be placed under the effective 
supervision of UN peacekeeping forces before midnight 19 
February. 
  Muslim forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina have also agreed to turn 
over heavy weaponry to the supervision of UN peacekeeping troops 
by the same deadline, and have already taken action to do so. 
  According to reports, the change in the Serbs' stand has to 
do with Russia's active mediation. After a meeting on 15 
February with visiting British Prime Minister Major, who had 
gone to Moscow on a "persuasion mission," President Yeltsin 
explicitly told reporters that Russia could not be excluded from 
mediation in the Bosnia-Herzegovina question. President 
Yeltsin's special envoy Churkin had over the past few days 
continuously conducted mediations among all conflicting parties. 
On 17 February, Churkin and Karadzic reached agreement that on 
the condition that Russia dispatch 800 blue-helmet troops to 
Bosnia-Herzewgovina, the Serbian armed forces would remove all 
heavy weaponry surrounding Sarajevo. 
  Russia has consistently taken a tough stance on NATO's 
ultimatum. A careful study yields three factors behind the 
Russian stance. First, Russia is extremely unhappy with the way 
the Western countries have bypassed the UN Security Council -- 
in fact, Russia -- in directly issuing the ultimatum to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Second, since Russia has always maintained 
traditional ties with the Slavic-speaking Serbs, abandoning the 
Serbs at a crucial moment is tantamount to forsaking Russian 
interests in the Balkan region. Third, a NATO air strike on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina would mean the first military operation 
conducted by the organization in the past 44 years since its 
inauguration; and to Russia, this is no different from 
recognizing the eastward thrust of NATO's defense line, which 
will seriously undermine Russia's strategic interests. 
  In the wake of the Serbs' 17 February announcement 
consenting 
to withdrawal of heavy weapons, German Chancellor Kohl has 
appealed to all concerned that before the deadline of NATO's 
ultimatum, every opportunity should be taken to seek a political 
settlement, which British Prime Minister Major has said may 
avert NATO's possible air strikes. Belgian Vice Prime Minister 
Claes has urged the United States and Russia to work together to 
seek a peaceful settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina question. 
France and the United States have expressed cautious optimism, 
while emphasizing that as far as the Serbs are concerned, it is 
necessary to "hear what they say and watch what they do" and to 
adopt a "wait-and-see" attitude. U.S. President Clinton has 
again sounded a warning 17 February that should the Serbs fail 
to hand over heavy weapons before the deadline, NATO will take 
its air raid plan "extremely seriously." French Foreign Ministry 
spokesman DeKay [name as published] stressed on the evening of 
17 February that the Serbs "should meet all the conditions set 
in the NATO ultimatum." 
  Reportedly the NATO ultimatum, which was proposed by France, 
is aimed at ending the war and bringing about peace through 
exerting pressure on France's neighbor as soon as possible to 
reverse the stalemate situation in spite of the EC states' 
energetic mediation; it is also aimed at paving the way for 
France to regain its status as a political power. To this end, 
France abandoned the UN banner, which it had consistently upheld 
in the past, and proposed a direct NATO ultimatum to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Meanwhile, France has also realized that 
armed settlement can only be the "last resort," and has strived 
to resolve the crisis and seek political settlement within the 
scope of a joint action by the EC, the United States, and Russia. 
  It is understood that the foreign ministers of Russia, 
Germany, Greece, and Belgium and EC officials concerned held a 
joint meeting in Athens 18 February to continue the search for a 
peaceful settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina question. 
  In another development, UN special envoy to former 
Yugoslavia 
Aikxy [name as published] held "useful talks" with Muslim leader 
Izetbegovic in Sarajevo 18 February. Beginning 19 February, UN 
peacekeeping forces will inspect the vicinity of Sarajevo and 
examine the removal of heavy weaponry by the Serbs and Muslims. 
A NATO spokesman declared on 18 February that before the 
complete withdrawal of the Serbs' heavy weaponry, NATO's 
determination to conduct air strikes on Bosnia-Herzegovina 
remains unchanged. It is understood that the defense ministers 
of the United States, Britain, France, Italy, and the 
Netherlands will meet at Italy's Aweiyanuo [name as published] 
Air Base 20 February to make the final decision on air strikes.

  [Excerpts] Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar, who is paying a 
three-day official visit to China, has ended the first day of 
his stay. 
  From the point of view of the talks this was a significant 
day. He met the highest representatives of this enormous state. 
Our correspondent Michal Michalcik telephoned from Beijing: 
  [Begin recording] [Michalcik] [passage omitted] The most 
important result is that both sides are interested in broadening 
and deepening mutual cooperation in power engineering, 
transport, telecommunications, and chemical and engineering 
industries. The agreement on trade and economic cooperation was 
signed at 1115 [local time]. Premier Vladimir Meciar said on 
this occasion: 
  [Meciar] This agreement creates a new legal basis. 
  [Michalcik] Does this mean that in comparison--for example, 
with Japan, Asian countries, or advanced West European 
countries--we have a chance to enter the Chinese market? 
  [Meciar] Let the figures speak for themselves. The turnover 
of the Slovak Republic for last year was $37 million, while the 
turnover of the Czech Republic was $370 million. So there is a 
markedly undervalued potential we can develop in the future and 
[words indistinct] where we can be successful. 
  [Michalcik] Regarding the agreement, within the framework of 
bilateral relations with China we signed the following 
documents: an agreement on prevention of double taxation, an 
agreement on support and protection of investments, and an 
agreement on technical and economic cooperation. [passage 
omitted on agenda and changing China]

  [Text] Beijing, February 22 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Slovak 
Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar expressed his belief that 
Slovakia-China cooperation in the fields of trade and economy 
will grow quickly. 
  He made the remark here this afternoon at a news conference. 
  "There are great potentials for cooperation between our two 
countries. The agreement on trade and economy signed by the two 
governments will provide a firm legal basis for our future 
cooperation," said Meciar. 
  "China has a huge market as well as great economic 
potential, 
which is sure to expand in the future. We are glad to have 
opportunities to cooperate with China." 
  Meciar emphasized:" the People's Republic of China is one of 
the first countries which recognized Slovakia's independence, 
and is also the first Asian country to set up an embassy in the 
capital of Slovakia." 
  Meciar said Slovak people attach great importance to such an 
attitude by China to Slovakia. 
  Replying to a question about Taiwan, Meciar said that the 
Government of People's Republic of China is the sole legal 
Government of China, and Slovakia does not support Taiwan's 
admission into the United Nations. 
  "The trade and commercial relations between Slovakia and 
Taiwan will never grow to the stage or level of political 
recognition," Meciar said. 
  He noted that the issue of Taiwan is China's internal 
affair, 
and it is only the Chinese people who can decide the arrangement 
concerning Taiwan. 
  Meciar also answered questions about regional issues in 
Europe. 
  Meciar and his party visited the Great Wall this morning and 
left for Shanghai, the biggest industrial city in China, this 
afternoon.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Song Defu, minister of personnel, </F>
by staff reporter Zhai Qiyun (5049 0796 6663); place and date 
not given: "Reform the Personnel System To Meet the Needs of 
the Market Economy"] 
  [Text] In the process of expediting building the socialist 
market economic system, the way in which personnel work adapts 
to this basic change is a problem which concerns the people very 
much and which they badly need to understand. For this reason, 
this reporter interviewed Minister of Personnel Song Defu, 
asking him to talk about the work in, and the idea behind, 
expediting reform of the personnel system. 
  Song Defu gave a briefing on the situation and said that, 
according to the needs of the socialist market economic system, 
the general idea behind the future reform of the personnel 
system in our country is: Increase the weight of the reform, 
quicken the pace of reform, and gradually establish a personnel 
management system which corresponds to the socialist market 
economic system. That is to say, establish a good personnel 
system for managing different types of establishments, a 
scientific and reasonable system to distribute wages, a 
multifold social insurance system, a macropersonnel management 
system, a system of personnel markets, and a system of personnel 
regulations. 
  Building and implementing a public service system is the key 
point in this year's reform of the personnel system. Song Defu 
said that in 1994 we must create a good beginning for 
implementing the public service system. This year also, on the 
foundation of the reform of government organs, various 
departments under the State Council and a majority of provincial 
government departments and the government departments of the 
separately listed cities, we must establish a rudimentary shape 
for the public service system and change the current personnel 
into public servants. Whether units carry out reform of organs 
or not, when they hire nonleading personnel below the rank of a 
presiding member of an administrative section, they must hold 
open examinations, judge qualifications strictly, and hire the 
best candidates. 
  Based on the: Needs of the market economy; nature, 
functions, duties, and characteristics of the institutions; and 
on the law of personnel growth, the reform of the personnel 
system in institutions must follow the road of "cutting links, 
dividing types, delegating power, and invigoration." 
  Based on the need to build a modern enterprise system, we 
must expedite reform of the personnel system in enterprises and 
develop steps to cancel the barriers between cadres and workers, 
between cadres under different ownership systems, and between 
cadres under different operational patterns within enterprises, 
to form employment mechanisms wherein personnel can go up and 
down and in and out, wherein choices are bilateral, and wherein 
personnel flow in a rational manner. We must also develop and 
groom a contingent of high quality and professional 
entrepreneurs. 
  Building a sound, scientific, and rational wages system is 
an 
issue which attracts the people's attention. Song Defu pointed 
out that we must further implement the principles of 
distribution according to labor, giving priority to efficiency 
and giving consideration to fairness. We must also introduce 
competitive and stimulating mechanisms, break egalitarianism, 
reasonably widen the gap, and establish corresponding wages 
systems and normal wage growth mechanisms based on the inherent 
characteristics of various government organs and institutions. 
The CPC Central Committee and State Council are paying a great 
deal of attention to this reform of the wages system and, under 
the condition that the state has a relatively difficult 
financial situation, they have done a great deal of work to 
increase wages and considered as much as possible the interests 
of the various quarters, enabling the new wages system to enter 
its track and operate. Because there are many contradictions 
which have been accumulated during distribution of wages, they 
cannot be solved by a single reform and the key is to enable it 
to get onto the track first and then gradually perfect it. 
  Building a social insurance system for government organs and 
institutions is a rather difficult issue. When talking about 
this, Song Defu said that because the funds in organs, 
institutions, and enterprises are from different sources, the 
ways of managing these funds are also different. Generally 
speaking, when raising and using the funds, we must uphold the 
principles of combining rights, obligations, and the compulsory 
nature; of sharing by the state, units, and individuals; and of 
social security administration being separate from social 
insurance funds operations. We must actively carry out 
experiments, implement the easier ones first, and reach targets 
step by step. We must first establish a system of overall 
planning for pension funds for contract workers in organs and 
institutions and the old-age insurance system in institutions 
should first be built in institutions which operate on their own 
incomes and expenditures. At the same time, work must be done 
to build a social insurance system for government organs, 
especially for state public servants, while the work in building 
an insurance system for the unemployed and disabled must also be 
stepped up. 
  The building of a socialist market economic system has 
increased the demand for capable personnel in society, so there 
is an urgent need to build a sound personnel market system. 
Song Defu said that building a personnel market system means 
"five changes." That is, the change from idle personnel and 
personnel shortages to market exchange, to regulation between 
too much and too few personnel, and to rational distribution; 
the change from ownership of personnel by units and organs to 
ownership of personnel by society, to meeting each other's 
needs, and to rational flow; the change from unilateral choices 
to bilateral choices in the flow of personnel; the change from 
"country markets" to "fixed markets" in the flow of personnel; 
and the change from the personnel resources distribution model 
characterized by "monopoly of supply and distribution," to the 
one wherein the personnel market plays a basic functional role 
in personnel resources distribution under the state's 
macromanagement. We must gradually establish sound regulations 
for personnel market operations and form a personnel market 
which is flexible, open, efficient, orderly, and characterized 
by fair competition; we must establish systems in areas such as 
personnel flow, arbitration, and contracts, to protect the 
legitimate rights of the units hiring personnel as well as those 
of the individuals, to guide the flow of personnel, and to 
control the volume and speed of flow, so that the personnel 
market operates in an orderly manner and within the limits of 
the law. We must also struggle to build, before 2000, a 
nationwide personnel market system which can perform a complete 
set of functions, has sound mechanisms, is supported by a legal 
system, and which can provide timely guidance and good services. 
  On the issue of establishing a system of sound personnel 
regulations, Song Defu said that 1994 will be a year of 
legislation for personnel work and that we must formulate, as 
soon as possible, regulations supporting the public service 
system, such as the: "Procedures for Carrying Out Classification 
of Positions of State Public Servants"; "Provisional Regulations 
on Employing State Public Servants"; and the "Provisional 
Regulations on Examinations for State Public Servants." We must 
try to formulate temporary regulations on awards, training, 
promotion and demotion, and on appointment or dismissal. We 
must speed up the work in formulating regulations governing 
personnel markets and regulations on arbitration of disputes in 
the areas of personnel market management and personnel flow. In 
the area of personnel regulations for enterprises and 
institutions, we must formulate, as soon as possible, the 
"Regulations on Personnel Management for State-Owned 
Enterprises," the "Regulations on Personnel Management for 
Joint-Venture Enterprises," and regulations on the old-age 
insurance system and wages in institutions. 
  Song Defu said that building a market economic system has 
brought many new problems to personnel work, requiring personnel 
workers to seriously learn from Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; seriously 
study the laws of market economy; adhere to the reform 
direction; and, when developing our excellent traditions, change 
the way of thinking which we have inherited from the planned 
economy, cast off the trammels of the old concepts which are not 
in accordance with the actual conditions of contemporary China, 
resolutely use the reform way of thinking to study the new 
situation, and use the reform method to solve new problems.

  [Text] Zhuhai, February 22 (CNS)--Civil aviation in China 
has to put an emphasis on security of air traffic and stop 
various kinds of incidents this year, the Deputy Director of the 
Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), Mr. Yan Zhixiang, 
said in a meeting on security work within national civil 
aviation. 
  Mr. Yan stressed that such security work this year would be 
carried out strictly with the stress being placed on technology, 
style of work and discipline in respect to flights, cabin 
service and air control. Such strict practice must be 
implemented by various entities and departments within CAAC. 
  Speaking of safety coming first with the stress being placed 
on prevention, Mr. Yan noted that attention should be paid not 
only to development of air services and its scope, production 
management and economic indicators especially under stiff market 
competition, but much more importantly to security, 
administration of air safety and to all safety indicators with 
an all-time emphasis on security work [sentence as received]. 
  Mr. Yan when talking of the system of responsibility for air 
safety stressed that the legal person of a particular enterprise 
had to be held responsible for safety and that the awareness of 
risk should be strengthened. Safety factors had to be given 
prominence and safety procedures had to be strictly carried out. 
Leading cadres had to take the lead in conducting strict 
procedures and no leniency should be given to air crews found 
culpable of wrongdoing during flights. Various relevant 
entities should be accountable for the performance of their 
duties. 
  The meeting was the largest of its kind ever held by the 
national civil aviation sector and was attended by personnel 
from local branches of CAAC, main airports, airliners under the 
direct control of CAAC as well as their branches, flight teams 
and air companies across the country.

  [Text] Beijing, February 22 (XINHUA) -- China's 
non-communist democratic parties have put forward a series of 
valuable suggestions regarding the country's economic 
construction and modernization in the past year and their 
suggestions have pushed forward the work by the Chinese 
Communist Party, a spokesman for the State Council said here 
today. 
  Their papers include calls for the earliest possible start 
of 
channelling of southern China's rich water resources into North 
China, strengthening of agricultural production and grass-roots 
education, opening up of a Euro-Asia economic zone, and ways to 
address the situation in Taiwan. 
  He said that the democratic parties' proposals have greatly 
helped the Chinese Communist Party's work, as they are the 
results of actual investigation and meet many of the needs of 
reform and opening. 
  He said that by offering such advice, the democratic parties 
have effectively given their roles full play in discussing and 
participating in the country's political affairs, and made new 
contribution to country's modernization drive.

  [Text] Paris, February 22 (CNS)--An increasing number of 
Chinese students are returning from France with their number 
outstripping for the first time the number of state-supported 
students going to France last year. Among 355 returned 
students, 81 are doctorate degree-holders, according to China's 
embassy in France. 
  Some 5,000 Chinese students have been sent to study in 
France 
at public expense since reform and opening to the outside world 
started. To date, over 3,000 of them have returned to China, 
constituting 60 percent of the total number. 
  The embassy's education counsellor in France said that the 
policy of the Chinese government on supporting students studying 
abroad, the encouragement of their returning to China and their 
free coming and going had won the understanding and cooperation 
of most of the Chinese students studying abroad. Those in 
France said that the policy indicated the state's kindness and 
trust in making it possible for them to choose various ways to 
serve their motherland. They also held that returning to China 
would fully exploit their talents in view of the new economic 
situation in China. 
  Compared with China, the ongoing depressed European economy 
and particularly the rapid increase in the number of unemployed 
in France made it difficult for Chinese students there to get 
suitable jobs while the immigration laws recently issued by the 
French government made such problems as residence and social 
insurance for foreign students there unsettling, adding another 
reason for the increase in the number of Chinese students 
returning home.

<F P=106> [Article by special correspondent in Hong Kong: "Recent </F>
Transfer of Military Brass Involved Some 100 Senior Officers"] 
  [Text] In mid-December last year, some 200 senior officers 
of the PRC military gathered at Beijing's Jingxi Guest House to 
participate in a secret meeting convened by the CPC Central 
Military Commission [CPCCMC] (said to be an enlarged session of 
the Central Military Commission.) At the meeting, CPCCMC First 
Vice Chairman Liu Huaqing announced an order that had been 
signed by CPCCMC Chairman Jiang Zemin: A transfer of the 
leadership tier of the PLA's seven military regions, as well as 
of the Navy and the Air Force was to be conducted in a big way. 
(Please refer to the attached table for the new list of senior 
officers.) 
  According to a well-informed figure, in the recent transfer 
of PRC military brass, some 100 PLA senior officers were 
involved, and both the scope of the reshuffle and the number of 
generals involved has been rare in the PRC military over the 
past 10 years. 
  Western military observers in Beijing believe that the 
recent 
reshuffle was the boldest action involving high-ranking militry 
personnel taken since Jiang Zemin succeeded Deng Xiaoping as the 
supreme commander of the Chinese military, and it was aimed at 
ensuring Jiang Zemin's firm control and command of military 
power from both the organizational and personnel framework. 
  The recent great change in the PRC high-ranking military 
personnel was quite unusual; it did not follow past practice, 
which was characterized by briefings beforehand. Jiang Zemin 
had no military background, and very few historical connections 
with the military; how could he be so bold on this most 
sensitive issue of the high-ranking tier of the military? It 
has been learned that Deng Xiaoping masterminded the scheme 
behind the scenes. 
  The Chinese people's army all along has been the pillar on 
which the CPC has maintained its rule. Since Jiang Zemin had 
become the CPCCMC chairman -- the No. 1 man of the Chinese 
military -- he had suffered from a lack of confidence in command 
and control over the Army. Under the pressure of the internal 
and external situations in September 1989, Deng Xiaoping 
resigned, and allowed Jiang Zemin to succeed him as "the supreme 
commander" of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. On 12 
November 1989, when Deng Xiaoping met the military brass 
participating in the enlarged session of the Central Military 
Commission, he expressed the hope that Jiang would "genuinely 
control the Army, and would do a good job of it, at that" in the 
presence of the commanders of the three services, whereas he 
required the Army -- especially intermediate- and senior-ranking 
officers -- to be subject to the command of the Central Military 
Commission with Jiang Zemin as the core. 
  Over the past few years, Jiang has been working hard at his 
office as CPCCMC chairman, doing his best to have a hand in Army 
affairs, and playing the role of the "supreme commander" to the 
three services, but it was not easy for Jiang Zemin to have 
genuine command and control over the Army, owing to his lack of 
experience and prestige. He was helpless and had to seek Deng 
Xiaoping's advice on running the Army on the eve of the 
convocation of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Central 
Committee. It has been learned that the experienced and astute 
Deng Xiaoping personally gave him the instruction that it was 
imperative to achieve a flow of military brass, and that none of 
them should stay too long at a post in the same locality, saying 
that Mao Zedong and Deng himself had resorted to this effective 
approach when they ran the Army. 
  In the wake of Jiang Zemin taking "the Central Military 
Commission" office, there was instability in the Army's thinking 
owing to the aftermath of the "4 June" incident; Jiang Zemin did 
not dare take any great action in the personnel framework. Even 
when Deng Xiaoping removed the Yangs from their military offices 
[Yang Shangkun, former president and formerly permanent vice 
chairman and secretary general of the CPCCMC; and his 
half-brother, Yang Baibing, former director of the PLA General 
Political Department and former member of the PRC Central 
Military Commission], Jiang Zemin resorted to comparatively mild 
methods to handle the cases of those senior officers who had 
followed the Yangs, and refrained from taking extreme measures. 
  Now it had been five years since Jiang Zemin took command of 
the three services, and Deng Xiaoping believed the time was ripe 
for Jiang to conduct a major reshuffle of high-level military 
leading bodies in a big way. At the same time, the measure also 
could be used to test whether or not the top echelon of the 
military was obedient to Jiang Zemin's leadership, and whether 
or not Jiang Zemin had "complete command over the whole Army." 
Jiang followed Deng Xiaoping's instructions. 
  To ensure the political stability in mainland China after 
Deng Xiaoping and to remove hidden dangers, the influences 
nurtured by the Yang brothers have been purged mercilessly 
during the recent military brass reshuffle. Yang Shangkun was 
in the office of Central Military Commission vice chairman and 
concurrently secretary-general for many years, and his brother 
Yang Baibing all along had had a grip on the power to appoint 
senior officers at and above the division level since he had 
taken office as director of the PLA's General Political 
Department in 1985. In the wake of the 4 June incident, one of 
the two brothers was first vice chairman of the Central Military 
Commission, and the other was the commission's secretary-general 
and concurrently PLA General Political Department director, 
responsible for the routine work of the Central Military 
Commission. The two brothers would hesitate at nothing, and 
they built up their own influence within the Army in a big way. 
  The recent transfers have resulted in eliminatng the Yangs' 
men through selection. For example, Lieutenant General Zhang 
Gong, former political commissar of the Beijing Military Region, 
first was transferred to the office of political commissar of 
the Chengdu Military Region -- a demotion after the 14th party 
congress; he was transferred again during the recent reshuffle, 
and was replaced by Lieutenant General Zhang Zhijian, former 
commander of the Beijing Garrison, who was chosed personally by 
Jiang Zemin. 
  The surfacing of some new faces among the PRC military brass 
in the recent reshuffle is another point that catches people's 
attention. For a long time, problems in the top echelon of the 
PRC military -- such as aging, low educational background, and 
making decisions on personnel affairs according to 
qualifications and seniority -- had been very difficult to 
change, and were not in conformity with the CPC goal of 
achieving army modernization. 
  In the wake of the recent transfer, at the military region, 
Navy, and Air Force leadership level, two or three deputies 
below the age of 50 have been equipped, and a number of new 
faces in the prime of life have come out in the open. For 
example, the deputy commander of the Air Force, who formerly was 
commander of the Wuhan Airborne Corps and who made his debut 
recently, is only 44 years old. These new faces at the top 
echelon of the military all have been regarded as absolutely 
reliable politically, and they have a tertiary educational 
background, as well as rich experience in commanding troops. 
They should be regarded as the Chinese military's "stars of 
tomorrow." In two or three years, they will be chief 
responsible persons of various military regions. 
  With Deng Xiaoping's behind-the-scenes backing, Jiang 
Zemin's 
recent transfer of the military brass has been completed 
already, and the military brass who participated in the secret 
meeting at the Jingxi Guest House had quietly accepted the 
accomplished fact of the "great change and transfer," while 
expressing their support for the decision by Jiang Zemin, "the 
Central Military Commission chairman," one after another. This 
has eased Jiang Zemin's mind.

  [Text] Lieutenant-General Zhang Gong, the military 
spokesman who claimed no students were killed in Tiananmen 
Square in the crushing of the 1989 pro democracy demonstrations, 
has been dismissed from his post. 
  He was the political commissar of the Chengdu military 
region. 
  Zhang, 59, has been transferred to the Academy of Military 
Sciences in what appears to be the only politically motivated 
transfer in a large scale reshuffle of personnel in the military 
regions and commands. 
  The other changes appear to be routine retirements based on 
age, despite expectations of some analysts that this occasion 
would be used to carry out a second purge of allies and 
associates of Yang Baibing, who was removed from his post as 
secretary general of the Central Military Commission in 1992. 
  The new wave of military personnel changes is the biggest 
since the reorganisation of the main military leadership in 
mid-1990. 
  In all, 80 military region and command positions have been 
changed, analysts said. Zhang was reviled by many Chinese for 
his role as political department director of the martial law 
enforcement troops during the 1989 crackdown. 
  In a televised news conference widely broadcast in China 
after June 4, Zhang claimed that no students had been killed in 
Tiananmen Square. His claim may have been technically true. 
  No student demonstrators are known to have died on the 
square 
in the early morning of 4 June, though there were several 
civilian casualties within a few metres of the square, and large 
numbers of soldiers and civilians were killed as the martial law 
forces pushed their way into the centre of the city from the 
west. Zhang's appearance on television cemented his image as an 
apologist for the crackdown. He is being replaced by Zhang 
Zhijian, deputy commander of Beijing military region. 
  Meanwhile, Deng Xiaoping appears to be taking a less active 
role in military affairs with the departure of his secretary, 
Wang Ruilin, who also acted as his eyes and ears on the Central 
Military Commission. Wang, secretary of the Commission for 
Discipline Inspection of the Party's Central Military 
Commission, is no longer active as Deng's secretary, having left 
Deng's personal office some months ago, according to Beijing 
sources. His importance at the military commission was enhanced 
after Deng's relationship with Yang Shangkun deteriorated over 
1991-92. At that time, Wang was responsible for arranging 
Deng's meetings and appointments, but that job has been taken by 
Deng's eldest daughter, Deng Rong. 
  The military reshuffle has not affected any seats on the 
Central Military Commission (CMC), but the post of 
secretary-general, which has been unfilled since Yang Baibing 
was dismissed from the post in 1992, may have a new occupant 
soon. General Chi Haotian and General Zhang Wannian are tipped 
as possible candidates to fill the long-standing vacancy, 
Beijing sources said. 
  The power base of the Chinese Communist Party general 
secretary, Jiang Zemin, is still considerably weaker than that 
of his predecessors, Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang. Some analysts 
believe that Chi's appointment as CMC secretary-general would 
strengthen Jiang's position in the military.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Over 10,000 Enterprises Have Been </F>
Merged in China"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 16 Feb (LIEN HO PAO) -- According to a 
department on the mainland, a national center for the 
transaction of property rights -- the China International 
Property Rights Transactions Center -- will be set up in Beijing. 
  The transactions center will be composed of 30 financial 
institutions and major enterprise groups on the mainland, 
including the China Economic Development, Trust, and Investment 
Corporation, the Hangzhou Bund Construction Joint-Stock Company 
Limited, the China Everbright International Trust and Investment 
Corporation, and the Shenzhen Baoan (Group) Corporation. Prior 
to this, there were already 25 property rights transaction 
markets set up in various parts of the country, including the 
regional markets in Henan, Shanghai, Nanjing, Shandong, Chengdu, 
Shenzhen, and Zhejiang. 
  To promote the rational flow and realignment of enterprise 
property rights so as to attain the best formation of resources 
and scale, the center will activate stock assets, improve the 
pattern of assets operation, make up for the shortfall in 
construction fund, and ensure that the value of state-owned 
assets can be preserved and increased. Since the early 1980's, 
transactions markets focusing on property rights have emerged on 
the Chinese mainland. After several years of development, 
property rights transactions brought notable results to China's 
national economy and increasingly became an important method of 
optimizing the allocation of state-owned assets under the 
socialist market economic conditions. According to statistics, 
in the whole of the 1980's, over 6,900 enterprises were merged 
across China, with over 8 billion yuan of stock assets 
transferred, and 4,090 enterprises reduced their losses by 522 
million yuan. In the 1990's property rights transactions have 
further developed. To date, over 10,000 enterprises have been 
merged. 
  With the emergence and ever-growing expansion of property 
rights transactions, a series of relevant laws and regulations 
have been established and perfected. So far, the Chinese 
mainland has promulgated and implemented the "Bankruptcy Law," 
"Company Law," "Interim Regulations on Merger of Enterprises," 
"Interim Regulations on Selling the Property Rights of Small 
State-Owned Enterprises," "Regulations on Managing the 
Evaluation of State-Owned Assets," "Regulations on Changing the 
Operational Mechanism of Industrial Enterprises Under Ownership 
by the Whole People," and other laws and regulations. Other 
laws and regulations, such as the "Securities Law," "Banking 
Law," and "Provisions on Unemployment Insurance for Workers and 
Staff Members of State-Owned Enterprises" are still being 
drafted.

  [Text] Beijing, February 22 (XINHUA) -- China's public 
ownership monopoly has been replaced by a brand-new ownership 
structure featuring the common development of diverse economic 
elements. 
  According to the latest survey done by the State Commission 
for Restructuring the Economy, the proportions taken up by the 
public economy in the national industrial output value and the 
national retail volume of consumer goods have both declined, 
while those of the non-public economy have increased steadily. 
  The survey shows that in the national industrial output 
value 
the proportion for state-owned industrial enterprises was 48.3 
percent in 1992, down from 77.6 percent in 1978, when China 
launched its reform and opening-up drive. 
  Meanwhile, the output value of collective industrial 
enterprises climbed from 22.4 percent to 38.2 percent during the 
same period. And the other 13.5 percent was accounted for by 
foreign-funded, private and individual undertakings, which made 
their debuts only after 1978. 
  In the national retail volume of consumer goods, the 
state-owned sector's share decreased from 54.6 percent in 1978 
to 41.3 percent in 1992. The share of the collective sector 
also dropped during the 1978-1992 period, from 43.3 percent to 
27.9 percent. But the share of other economic elements jumped 
from 2.1 percent to 30.8 percent during the same period. 
  The survey shows that in 1992 the output value of 
state-owned 
industries increased by 14.4 percent over the previous year, 
while that of collective and township enterprises and other 
industries, including foreign-funded enterprises, rose by 28.5 
percent, 40 percent and 48.8 percent, respectively. 
  In south China's Guangdong Province, the survey shows, 
non-public enterprises, employing more than 6.34 million people, 
make up 52.4 percent of the total registered capital. The 
proportions for state-owned enterprises and collective 
enterprises are 31.2 percent and 16.4 percent, respectively, the 
survey adds.

3668): "Highways--From 75,000 to Over 1 Million Miles"] 
  [Text] On 25 December 1954, people across the country 
warmly celebrated the official opening to traffic of the 
Sichuan-Tibet and the Qinghai-Tibet highways. RENMIN RIBAO 
published a special editorial extending congratulations on this 
success. The two highways, whose combined length totaled 4,355 
km were only paved with a low grade sand-and-pebble surface. 
Since reform and opening up, the Qinghai-Tibet highway has 
taken on a new look. In 1984, it was tarred and, in 1992, it 
was upgraded when frost-proofing materials were added. 
  Although old China claimed to have left behind 120,000 to 
130,000 km of highways, in fact, only 75,000 km could be used on 
the eve of the birth of New China. After more than 40 years of 
construction, China (excluding the province of Taiwan) had 
highways totaling 1.075 million km as of the end of 1993, 
representing an addition of exactly 1 million km. 
  Before the 1970's, China's highway construction rested 
mainly 
with the localities and the masses and was became popular. 
Between 1951 and 1956, an additional 100,000 km were built and, 
between 1956 and 1959, and average 100,000 km were added each 
year. One of the reasons for the rapid development was 
"popularization." Despite the comparatively low grade, what 
mattered was that they could be used. 
  Since reform and opening up, the principles that "the better 
the highway is, the richer one gets" and "the speedier one gets, 
the faster one becomes rich" have generally been accepted. 
Highway construction has integrated popularization and 
upgrading, with the emphasis on the latter. Of the added 1 
million km, expressways account for 1,145 km and first and 
second grade special highways account for 7,281 km. 
  Despite the glorious achievements made in China's highway 
construction over the past 40 years or more, and particularly 
during the past 15 years of reform and opening up, and the fact 
that all counties, 96 percent of towns and townships, and 74 
percent of administrative villages across the country are 
accessible by car, we still have a large gap compared with 
developed countries. They are few in number: Each square 
kilometer of land only has 11.2 m of highway. They are low in 
grade: Second grade highways or higher only account for 
approximately 6.2 percent of the total and village highways are 
in comparatively poor condition. 
  What is heartening, however, is that departments in charge 
of 
highway construction in China have already made plans 
accordingly. By the end of this century, the highway mileage 
will reach 1.25 million km. The formulation of the grand plan 
that four main state expressways and three important sections 
which form great routes linking east, west, south, and north is 
now being stepped up.

  [Text] Shijiazhuang, February 23 (XINHUA) -- China will ask 
for international tenders for the construction of the World 
Bank-funded Shijiazhuang-Anyang section of the Beijing-Shenzhen 
expressway. 
  According to officials with the Hebei Provincial Transport 
Bureau, preparations for the bidding have been completed and the 
offering of tenders will be officially opened next month. 
  The Shijiazhuang-Anyang expressway, at a length of 216 km, 
will involve a use of 240 million U.S. dollars in loans from the 
World Bank, the largest World Bank loans China has ever used. 
  Construction of the section from Beijing to Shijiazhuang, 
with a length of more than 280 km, has been completed and was 
put into use at the end of last year. 
  Construction of subsequent sections of the expressway 
southward from Anyang city, in central China's Henan Province, 
will be undertaken by the provinces through which the 
thoroughfare passes. 
  The officials said that they had completed the arrangements 
with the help of the China International Bidding Company and had 
already published tendering promotion materials on the world 
highway construction market. 
  According to the officials, more than 30 businessmen 
involved 
in contracting projects from all over the world have come and 
carried out on-the-spot investigations of the 
Shijiazhuang-Anyang section. 
  The officials added that construction of the 
Shijiazhuang-Anyang section would start in May, after the 
bidding is finished.

  [Text] Shanghai, February 23 (XINHUA) -- The Shanghai Stock 
Exchange (SSE) is to adopt a series of new measures this year, 
in a bid to integrate itself with the international market. 
  According to SSE sources, the measures include listing a 
batch of Shanghai enterprises, issuing their B-stocks on 
overseas bourses, providing agency services and establishing a 
system of B-stock terminal trading. 
  The SSE intends to enroll members from foreign securities 
companies, which will enjoy the same treatment as domestic ones. 
And a state bond market open to overseas investors is in the 
making. 
  Several big-name conglomerates, including Germany's 
Daimler-Benz Group, are holding discussions with the SSE, 
seeking to be listed on the Shanghai equity market. 
  In addition, the SSE is to improve its dealing system and 
communications network with hi-tech equipment. 
  Now it is negotiating with relevant companies on purchasing 
a 
special telecommunications satellite which may go into use in 
this year's third quarter. 
  The SSE will also connect its computerized dealing terminal 
with those in Hong Kong, the United States and Britain. 
  Experts hold that at the end of this year the SSE will meet 
international requirements for worldwide competition.

<F P=106> [Report of interview with Eastern Airlines Vice President </F>
Xiao Liyuan (5618 4539 0337) by staff reporter Chiu I (5941 
3015) in Shanghai on 21 February: "Eastern Airlines Plans To 
Have Its Shares Listed on the U.S. Stock Market"] 
  [Text] Shanghai, 21 Feb (WEN WEI PO) -- As one of the two 
aviation companies among the second batch of Chinese state 
enterprises which had their shares listed on the overseas stock 
market, China Eastern Airlines Inc. [CEA Inc.] will seek a 
listing on the U.S. stock market, hoping to raise nearly 1 
billion dollars. This move has attracted much attention. Today, 
this reporter interviewed CEA Inc. Vice President Xiao Liyuan, 
who is in charge of the reform oriented to the joint-stock 
system. He spoke about listing preparations and the company's 
profile. 
<H5>  An Appraisal of Property and Funds Has Been Completed </H5>
  Xiao Liyuan said: China Eastern Airlines [CEA] is a core 
enterprise of CEA Inc., the latter being one of the 55 large 
enterprise groups approved by the State Council. At the moment, 
a reform is going on toward a joint-stock system, focusing on 
the company's air transport services, and preparations are being 
made to seek an overseas listing. The company has completed its 
internal appraisal of property and funds and has contacted 
intermediary organizations abroad, one of which will be 
designated before the end of this month, and the asset appraisal 
required for the listing can be carried out immediately. Xiao 
Liyuan said that the preparations for the listing can be 
expected to complete within six months. 
<H5>  Total Assets of 11.5 Billion Yuan </H5>
  Xiao Liyuan said: CEA now has 69 passenger and cargo 
aircraft of world standard and the models include MD-11, MD-11F, 
A300-600R, A310-300, MD-82, and FK-100, most of which are on 
charter. It has opened over 100 air routes connecting such 
countries as the United States, Japan, Bahrain, Belgium, Spain, 
the ROK, Thailand, and Singapore; the Hong Kong region; and over 
50 cities within China. The total assets of the company amount 
to 11.5 billion yuan. In 1993, the company had over 7,000 
employees. At the moment, the CEA's Shanghai line has nearly 
400 pilots, mostly graduates of the Civil Aviation Flying School 
with subsequent training abroad. Each year, they go to Europe 
or the United States for retraining in flight simulators to keep 
up their professionalism. The total transportation turnover is 
850 million tonne-km; 5.5 million passengers have been handled; 
the cargo and postal volume amounts to 140,000 tonne; the 
average annual utilization ratio of the seating capacity is over 
70 percent; the income from mainline operations is 3.467 billion 
yuan; foreign exchange earnings are $374.88 million; and all its 
economic indexes measure up to the tradewide advanced levels 
within China. In the first half of last year, CEA Inc. came 
first on the Civil Aviation Administration of China's profit 
chart for all aviation companies in the country. 
<H5>  Focusing on Developing International Business </H5>
  Speaking on the distribution of air routes, Xiao Liyuan said 
that before the European and American routes were opened, the 
CEA focused on short-distance international and regional routes. 
But now, the company has completed its conversion into an 
international aviation company. In 1993, the income from 
international flights accounted for 65 percent of the company's 
total turnover, the corresponding figure in 1992 being 60 
percent. In the future, CEA will continue to expand its 
operations on international routes and strive to be an 
enterprise with a relatively high degree of competitiveness 
among international airlines and measures up to world advanced 
levels. 
  Xiao Liyuan said: Despite the fact that international 
aviation is in recession and the demand on China's domestic air 
market remains brisk, CEA is continuing to expand its 
international operations. Some other airlines in the world have 
found this hard to understand. Xiao Liyuan explained that 
first, the international routes that CEA covers are profitable 
and are in the ascendant. Second, as China's opening up to the 
outside world is continually expanding, the growth in 
international exchanges is bound to increase business volume. 
Moreover, Shanghai's strategic goal beyond this century is to 
become an international financial, trade, and economic center, 
which also requires a matching international aviation company 
and CEA is duty bound to contribute to it. In the meantime, 
CEA's measures on its domestic routes will focus on 
redistributing its transportation capacity, concentrating on the 
profitable ones rather than reducing the scope. 
  Facing the highly competitive international air transport 
market, Xiao Liyuan believes that the most competitive asset CEA 
has is its low operation cost. This is especially true with the 
cost of employees, which is merely one-tenth of that of some 
foreign airlines. The major cost outlays are for fuel and 
aircraft maintenance. Xiao Liyuan said that because the average 
service age of the CEA's fleet is under seven years, heavy 
repairs are not yet necessary. CEA is now able to carry out 
overhauls on the MD82 independently. To improve the company's 
aircraft maintenance capabilities, it is planning to build a new 
hangar, which will be the biggest in the Far East, and gradually 
enable itself to conduct independent D [in Roman script]-tests 
on all large aircraft. 
<H5>  Combining Exchange Rates Has No Major Impact </H5>
  Xiao Liyuan said: The funds CEA Inc. wants to raise by 
listing its shares on the U.S. stock market will mainly be used 
to: Buy new passenger jumbo jets suited to intercontinental 
flight; repay the interest for aircraft chartering and other 
liabilities; improve the company's aircraft servicing 
capabilities; and update its servicing equipment. Xiao Liyuan 
said: Two A300's will be delivered in 1994 and two more will be 
purchased in 1995. Besides, there is also a tentative plan to 
buy a certain number of A340's. Xiao believed that because the 
CEA has been successful in earning foreign exchange and adjusted 
the fares after the exchange rates were combined, the reform of 
the exchange rate system has not had much impact on it. However, 
he also said that the ongoing tax reform has set the income tax 
rate for all enterprises at a flat 3 percent, though the CEA's 
income tax rate used to be 18 percent. The company is still 
trying to keep the old rate.

news briefs: 
<H5>  Maanshan Iron and Steel Company </H5>
  Maanshan Iron and Steel Company in east China's Anhui 
Province has been ranked among the world most successful listing 
companies in 1993. 
  The selection was conducted by the authoritative 
"INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REVIEW" based in London. 
  The company raised 6.6 billion yuan, of which 4.2 billion 
yuan was from abroad, through stock issues in domestic and 
overseas markets last October. 
  Its H stock became a favorite in Hong Kong as soon as it was 
listed on the stock exchange. 
<H5>  Ship Inspection Simplified </H5>
  On February 21, Shanghai began to adopt simplified joint 
inspections on international cargo vessels. 
  It is stipulated that ships which are allowed to institute 
telecom quarantine can enter the port before going through 
formalities. Customs staff need not step on the ships to 
conduct procedures. 
  The rules shorten the time for a ship to enter the port, 
strengthen port management and make it convenient for 
international seamen to disembark.

yuan 
last year, up 50 percent over the previous year.

  [Text] Beijing, February 22 (XINHUA) -- China has so far 
opened 201 ports to the outside world, according to an official 
from the leading group for port administration under the State 
Council. 
  These include 22 state class ports opened in 1993. They are 
12 seaports, seven airports and three land ports. 
  The 201 ports include 108 seaports, 46 airports, 12 railway 
ports and 35 highway ports. 
  Before China implemented the reform and open policy, there 
were 51 ports open to the outside world. 
  These outlets have played an important role in Sino-foreign 
economic and cultural exchanges, Ye said. 
  Ye said more ports have been set up in inland areas in 
recent 
years. But a decade ago most open ports were scattered in 
border or coastal areas. 
  Besides state ports, some localities have also opened a 
number of provincial ports, which have greatly promoted local 
economic development. 
  He revealed that the country will open more ports this year

  [Text] Hangzhou, February 23 (XINHUA) -- The annexation of 
a loss-making enterprise is common in China's urban areas in the 
current efforts to develop the market economy. But, for the 
first time, a prosperous village has "annexed" a poor one. 
  Qiuer, an economically-developed village in Yinxian County, 
Zhejiang Province, took over the neighboring village of Sigang. 
  An official of Qiuer village admitted that Qiuer used to be 
a 
poor village, where penew weapoggled to make both ends meet. 
  But since the late 1970s, when China began its rural 
economic 
reform, the village leaders led the local farmers to develop a 
market economy with the focus on industry and service trades. 
  The village's gross output value exceeded 100 million yuan 
in 
1992, its collective property amounted to 72 million yuan and 
farmers' annual income averaged more than 3,000 yuan per capita. 
  At present, the village's 500 households have about 200 
directly- dial tnlephones and 15 private cars. 
  Visitors from other parts of the country and overseas stream 
into the village to learn from its experience in becoming 
well-off. 
  In contrast to Qiuer, neighboring Sigang village remained 
mired in poverty due to shortages of capital, technology and 
managerial workers. 
  To expand its economy and help its neighbor to become 
prosperous, Qiuer began to "annex" Sigang village in January 
last year. 
  With a bigger labor force and more cultivated land, the enl 
late Qiuer village has accelerated the expansion of its economy. 
  A survey shows that the village's gross product amounted to 
350 million yuan last year and its profits reached 25 million 
yuan, both increases of 150 percent. Farmers' annual income 
last year averaged 4,000 yuan per capita, more than twice that 
of the provincial average. 
  Soon after the "annexation", Qiuer spent more than one 
million yuan on helping the former Sigang village build roads, 
install running water and powerlast months, and improve its 
surroundings. All the villagers in the enlarged village enjoy 
the equal treatment. 
  One year later, the annual income of all the families has 
doubled, everyone enjoys co-operative medical treatment and 
retired farmers receive pensions. 
  "The change is way beyond our expectation," said Qiu Aiqing, 
a farmer in the former Sigang village. 
  Qiu has contracted to farm 1.3 ha of land, and his children 
are working in village-run enterprises. The annual income of 
the family averaged 3,100 yuan per capita last year, up from 
1,500 yuan in 1992. 
  According to Jin Haiteng, the head of Yinxian County, the 
"annexation" of a poor village by a rich one benefits both and 
leads to common prosperity. 
  "It is an inevitable result of the development of the 
socialist market economy and an optimum organization of 
resources," he said. 
  Although Zhejiang is located in China's 
economically-developed coastal area, some of its inland areas 
are still economically It isward. 
  With the encouragement of the provincial government, more 
and 
more rich areas are following the example of Qiuer village.

  [Text] Fuzhou, February 22 (XINHUA) -- South-east China's 
Fujian Province plans this year to lease out the rights to use 
300 hectares of land valued at 4 billion yuan (459 million U.S. 
dollars). 
  One of China's provinces piloting in the reform of the land 
use system, Fujian leased out the rights to use 450 plots of 
land with a combined area of more than 600 hectares, which were 
valued at 5.5 billion yuan (632 million U.S. dollars). 
  According to Ye Wenjian, director of the provincial land 
administration, the prices for land-leasing are becoming more 
and more scientific and rational; and the transactions of 
land-use rights are being undertaken according to law. 
  Ye noted that Fujian will adopt a series of measures to 
standardize the land property market this year. 
  The province will form a fair market competition mechanism 
to 
change the conventional government allocation of land to the 
paid transfer of land-use rights through bidding and auction.

  [Text] Fuzhou, February 22 (XINHUA) -- Foreign-funded 
enterprises in east China's Fujian Province generally report 
good economic returns. 
  According to statistics, some 80 percent of the province's 
12,778 foreign-funded firms are making profits, 15 percent 
maintain a balance and the other three percent to five percent 
are losing money. 
  The promising investment environment and profitable 
production spur foreign business people to expand their projects. 
  It is estimated that the increased amount of foreign 
investment so far this year is nearly 2 billion yuan. 
  Foreign-funded enterprises have become a major force in 
exports from the province. 
  Last year, foreign-funded companies achieved an export value 
of 3.004 billion dollars, constituting 52.9 percent of the total 
for Fujian. 
  Their exports include garments, shoes, electronic and 
chemical products and building materials. The markets are in 
Europe, the United States and Japan. 
  The average foreign investment in each foreign-funded 
project 
was 2.41 million U.S. dollars last year, much higher than the 
average for the country as a whole. 
  Overseas funds are increasing in infrastructure, the power 
industry and service sector. 
  A number of foreign-funded electric power projects have been 
approved by the province. The Meizhou Bay power plant is a 
solely foreign funded project. Its initial investment topped 
350 million U.S. dollars. 
  Foreign-funded firms have also started to conduct management 
based on Chinese monetary and taxation policies. 
  In addition, many of them have set up retirement insurance 
schemes for their employees.

  [Text] At the provincial sports work conference held on the 
morning of 21 February, Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the 
provincial party committee, called for efforts to fully 
understand the importance and necessity to strengthen sports 
work in the new situation, increase the dynamics of reform, 
achieve breakthroughs in key areas, and promote Shandong's 
sports undertakings as soon as possible. 
  The conference was held by the provincial party committee 
and 
government. Its major tasks were to summarize and introduce 
Shandong's experiences in sports work gained in the past few 
years and to discuss the major plans for developing Shandong's 
sports work in order to upgrade its level of competitive sports 
and build Shandong into an advanced province in sports as soon 
as possible. 
  Jiang Chunyun said in his speech: Like other work, 
Shandong's sports has also yielded notable results over the past 
few years. Compared with advanced provinces, however, there is 
still a large gap, which is manifested conspicuously in the slow 
pace in upgrading the level of competitive sports, the failure 
in emphasizing key sports, too small a number of outstanding 
athletes, especially first-rate ones, the small contributions to 
the state, the outdated concepts on sports, the weak sense of 
competition, the weak scientific and technological forces 
related to sports and the lack of personnel, inadequate 
investment in sports, and the lack of complete and extensive 
necessary sports facilities. We should give in-depth reflection 
over this issue, unify our thinking, and have great 
determination to promote our sports undertakings as soon as 
possible. 
  Jiang Chunyun pointed out: Developing sports is a 
long-cherished strong desire of the people of the province. 
Shandong totally has the conditions and ability to promote 
sports. It has no reasons, whatsoever, to fall behind. Based 
on the requirements on sports work put forward at the sixth 
provincial party congress, we have defined a strategic target of 
building Shandong into an advanced province in sports and 
ranking it among the strong provinces in sports in seven years. 
Shandong's sports work for the present and for some time to 
come should be dominated by reform, focused on competitive 
sports, and led by the endeavor to achieve technological 
progress. It should learn from the advanced experiences at home 
and abroad, seize the opportunity to bravely conduct 
explorations, go all out to catch up with others, and blaze a 
new road for sports development with Shandong's characteristics 
as soon as possible. 
  Jiang Chunyun emphasized: Strengthening leadership over 
sports work is the basic guarantee for attaining the strategic 
target of building Shandong into an advanced and strong province 
in sports. Party committees and governments at all levels across 
the province should regard sports as an important component of 
the socialist modernization drive, include it on their agenda, 
and study and resolve the issues on sports reform and 
development. The province, as well as prefectures and counties, 
should establish the leadership responsibility system at every 
level, enhance their work, implement specific measures, and 
promote sports work in a realistic manner. Leaders should be 
held responsible in the localities where sports cannot be 
promoted for long periods. From now on, achievements in sports 
work should be taken as a criterion for appraising party and 
government leaders at all levels. We should be willing to send 
competent personnel to work in sports departments, increase 
investment in sports undertakings, formulate and implement 
sports standards and plans, and strive to build Shandong into an 
advanced province in sports and rank it among the strong 
provinces in sports. 
  Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee and governor of the province, also spoke at the 
conference. Vice Governor Wu Aiying read the decision to 
commend the personnel who had made contributions to the seventh 
national games and advanced units. Responsible persons of the 
provincial trade union council, the provincial women's 
federation, the provincial commission for physical culture and 
sports, and the work committee of the organs of the provincial 
government also read the decisions to commend the personnel and 
units who had achieved outstanding results at the seventh 
national games. 
  Han Xikai, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee, chaired the conference. Attending were Lu Maozeng, 
chairman of the provincial committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference; Ma Zhongcai and Miao Fenglin, 
vice chairmen of the provincial people's congress standing 
committee; and Ma Changgui, special adviser to the provincial 
government.

  [Text] In deliberating the municipal government's work 
report during a panel discussion with people's congress deputies 
from Nanshi District yesterday afternoon [19 February], Deputy 
Wu Bangguo, member of the CPC Central Committee's Political 
Bureau and secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, 
once again reiterated: We must cherish and firmly seize 
opportunities. Our comrades should always bear in mind Comrade 
Xiaoping's dictum that development is the last word. In 
discussing this year's work, deputies asked whether 
deficit-ridden, district-owned collective enterprises should be 
allowed to declare bankruptcy. Wu Bangguo noted: Some small 
district-owned enterprises may be sold to individuals in a 
step-by-step manner, whereas enterprises incurring substantial 
losses may be allowed to go bankrupt. We must, however, 
approach this matter very prudently. 
  When deputies from educational circles discussed educational 
issues, Wu Bangguo said: It is not easy to undertake 
educational service. Shanghai now suffers an acute shortage of 
skilled personnel; the training of skilled personnel in demand 
brooks no delay. 
  Wu Bangguo exhorted: While maintaining Shanghai's strong 
momentum for economic development, we should earnestly solve 
several problems of concern to the people. First, we should 
ensure that shopping baskets are filled, stabilize and develop 
production bases of nonstaple foodstuffs, actively develop 
agriculture with distinctive features, and improve commodity 
distribution. Second, we should heed issues relating to 
state-owned enterprises, especially those pertaining to 
deficit-ridden enterprises. Properly dealing with enterprises 
making meager profits or incurring losses not only affects 
Shanghai's economic development but also the vital interests of 
many workers. We should be determined to solve these problems. 
Third, we should resettle [words indistinct]. Fourth, we 
should show concern for people's lives and earnestly solve the 
problems of low-wage workers regarding their livelihoods.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhou Yongnan (0719 0737 0589) and correspondent </F>
Xiao Shan (2556 1424): "Chai Songgue Addresses a Provincial 
Conference on State Security, Urges the Whole Party and People 
To Pay Great Attention to State Security Work"] 
  [Text] "The whole party and the whole people must pay great 
attention to state security work. It is even more important for 
state security organs to remain sober-minded, to have a clear 
understanding of the situation, to be mindful of possible danger 
in times of peace, to heighten our vigilance, to enhance their 
sense of urgency and responsibility, to always give prominence 
to efforts to maintain political and social stability, to 
strengthen the role of democratic dictatorship, and to actively 
prevent and crack down on various kinds of unlawful practices 
and criminal activities that jeopardize state security." These 
were the demands made by Chai Songyue, deputy secretary of the 
provincial party committee and executive vice governor, at a 
provincial conference on state security work held in Hangzhou on 
26 January. 
  On behalf of the provincial party committee and government, 
Chai Songyue highly praised the efforts made by the state 
security organs at all levels in the province to safeguard state 
security and social stability in the past year, and their 
contributions to promoting the economic development of Zhejiang 
Province. He said: On the whole, the current international 
situation is extremely favorable to us; however, we must clearly 
discern that the world is still not peaceful, because the 
underlying struggles between espionage and counterespionage, 
infiltration and counterintelligence, and attempts to steal 
secret information and efforts to combat such attempts have 
become increasingly complex and acute. Therefore, the more we 
carry out reform and the opening policy, and the more we 
accelerate economic development, the more we must beef up state 
security work. State security work is a strategic undertaking 
that has a bearing on the safety and well-being and on the 
survival or collapse of a country. It occupies a highly 
important place and plays a vital role in the political and 
social lives of a country. The provincial party committee and 
government have attached great importance to state security 
work. From now on, we still have to vigorously enhance our 
leadership over state security work and give our leaders greater 
support and help in their bid to eliminate worries and surmount 
difficulties. Party committees and governments at all levels 
must earnestly implement the instructions and guidelines of the 
CPC Central Committee, as well as the provincial party 
committee, with a great sense of political responsibility and a 
serious attitude, and must give practical help and support to 
state security organs. Various departments and units must also 
actively support and coordinate with state security organs while 
carrying out various tasks. At the same time, he pointed out: 
The work on the secret front is of a special nature, and this 
special nature calls for steadfast party spirit, a firm 
political stand, strict discipline, high professionalism, 
absolute loyalty, great skill and expertise among comrades on 
this front. He urged state security organs at all levels 
throughout the province to step up efforts to improve themselves 
and improve the combat effectiveness of their contingents, to 
train cadres and policemen to establish a concept to serve the 
people wholeheartedly, a concept of hard struggle and selfless 
dedication; to promote the spirit of "prudence and independence" 
[fayang shendu jingshen -- 4099 2254 1957 3747 4737 4377], to be 
good at resisting various types of degenerate thinking and at 
resisting the decadence and temptations of the seamy side of 
things, and to actively dedicate themselves to state security 
undertakings. 
  Si Daxiao, member of the Standing Committee of the 
provincial 
party committee and secretary of the provincial Political 
Science and Law Commission, was present at the meeting. 
  The meeting relayed the guidelines of the national state 
security conference. Zhu Ziru, director of the provincial state 
security department, presented a work report, and leaders at 
various levels under the provincial state security system 
attended the meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, February 22 (XINHUA) -- China will 
complete the construction of its largest commercial base for 
petroleum at Zhoushan Port, Zhejiang Province, in the first 
quarter of this year. 
  According to the "PEOPLE'S DAILY" [RENMIN RIBAO] (overseas 
edition) today, the feasibility study of the second phase of the 
project at Aoshan has passed a technical appraisal. 
  With an investment of 29.96 million U.S. dollars, the phase 
consists of oil tanks, with a combined storage capacity of 
500,000 cu m, and supportive facilities. 
  The base will have an annual handling capacity of more than 
10 million tons upon completion. 
  Zhoushan is a harbor with a lengthy coastline suitable for 
building docks; along 164 km the water is as deep as 10 m. It 
has a 1,000-sq-km inshore area, about the same size as that of 
Rotterdam Harbor in the Netherlands. 
  The paper noted that the Zhoushan City Government has 
decided 
to develop the port with foreign investment and cooperation. 
  At present, Zhoushan is speeding up the construction of 
infrastructure facilities to pave the way for the overall 
development of the port. An airport is expected to open to 
domestic routes in 1995, the paper reported.

  [Text] Guangdong has again squeaked through -- but at a 
price. In spite of the cold wind from the north over the need to 
march in step with Beijing -- and competition posed by Shanghai, 
Pudong and myriad upstarts -- Hong Kong's favourite province 
looks set to preserve what American economics guru Ezra Vogel 
calls its No. 1 status. In return for a relatively free hand to 
experiment with quasi-capitalistic market tools, however, 
Guangzhou has to make concessions to the cadre mandarins in the 
capital in economic, and particularly, political matters. 
  At the current Guangdong People's Congress, provincial 
leaders have unveiled a growth target for this year of 15 per 
cent, well above the national average of nine per cent. Local 
economists say this is an underestimation aimed at allaying 
Beijing's fears for hyperinflation and runaway capital 
construction. Individual cities, however, have openly vowed to 
maintain if not better their fantastic development clips of 
1993. These range from 23 per cent for Guangzhou and an 
incredible 96.9 per cent for Huadu, where the new Guangzhou 
International Airport would be located. 
  Equally important, Guangdong leaders have obliged Beijing to 
tone down tax policies -- mainly the "dual tax system" and the 
Value-Added Tax (VAT) -- aimed at boosting contributions to 
central coffers. When the fiscal reforms were promulgated late 
last year, Beijing was unequivocal about the fact they would be 
implemented on January 1, and that provincial authorities would 
have no autonomy to make local variations. In a briefing to a 
group of Hong Kong editors last weekend, however, Guangzhou 
mayor Li Ziliu hinted that Beijing had vouchsafed the province a 
"stable transition" of at least two years from the original 
"financial contract responsibility system" (FCRS) to the dual 
tax system. Under the old regime, Guangdong made a mutually 
agreed-upon contribution to Beijing, which took into 
consideration its need to retain more of its profits for 
re-investment. The new system, which will carve out tax bases 
for the centre and the localities, will give Guangdong no such 
edge. Mr Li claimed that the synthesis between the FCRS and the 
new tax regime will result in both central and local coffers 
getting more. 
  Guangdong officials have also assured Hong Kong and other 
overseas developers that, Beijing's strictures notwithstanding, 
there will be subtle regional variations to the VAT to be 
imposed on property deals. Mayor Li had this to say about the 
much-feared VAT on real estate: "Guangzhou will take into 
account practical realities and pay attention to dovetailing the 
new taxes with the old ones with a view to safeguarding the 
interests of investors." Translation: Guangdong officials will 
ally themselves with foreign investors in lobbying Beijing to 
acquiesce in modifications that will benefit all parties. 
  In spite of Beijing's recent emphasis on "boosting 
macro-level adjustment and control," Guangdong has made new 
strides in quasi-privatisation. Last year, exports from 
enterprises with foreign participation overtook those from state 
concerns. Mayor Li disclosed that all government-owned business 
units in his city will be converted into "Western-style" 
corporations within two years. Most of Guangzhou's money-losing 
state enterprises, which have assets amounting to 8 billion 
yuan, will be overhauled through means including their 
conversion into shareholding companies where workers and 
overseas investors can hold large stakes. 
  With its aggressive strategies of attracting foreign funds 
to 
hitherto taboo areas including airport construction, Guangdong's 
lead over the rest of country in the creative utilisation of 
non-Chinese capital is widening. Perhaps most important to the 
long-term prosperity of the "before-the-times" province, 
Guangdong has undertaken a number of relatively sensitive 
political reforms. For example, the legislative session this 
week is open to a record number of citizens, including the 
bosses of private businesses. The congress is also set to pass 
a landmark Law of Supervision that will vest powers in the 
provincial and municipal legislatures to "oversee and supervise" 
the work of the government, the courts and the procuratorates. 
For the first time, the congresses can summon officials to 
explain policies or account for dereliction of duty. Guangdong 
is also a pace-setter in the fight against graft. A number of 
cities have established anti-corruption or clean-government 
organs that are partially modelled on Hong Kong's Independent 
Commission Against Corruption. 
  Pronouncements by provincial leaders this past week have 
also 
made it clear, however, that Guangzhou has made major 
accommodations with Beijing. In deference to Beijing's revival 
of the old ideal of "taking grain as the key link", Guangdong 
will follow the national trend by laying down specific targets 
for the production of rice and wheat. To preserve arable land, 
the area of new industrial development will be cut by at least 
10 per cent this year. Investment in agriculture will also 
increase substantially. 
  It is unlikely Guangzhou can succeed in persuading Beijing 
to 
let it assume overall responsibility for "national-level" 
projects like the new airport. Beijing has foisted more serious 
political baggage on Guangdong with the imperative of building 
"spiritual civilisation," a tattered euphemism for strengthening 
one-party dictatorship and weeding out "all-out Westernisation". 
In his report to the congress, Governor Zhu Senlin toed the 
harsh line by reiterating the "firm with both hands" policy 
meaning that political control will be boosted in tandem with 
economic liberalisation. 
  Largely following Beijing's initiative, ideological police 
in 
the province have since late last year launched a ruthless 
crackdown on a dozen-odd publications for propagating "bourgeois 
liberalisation". Reports in the Hong Kong and Taiwan press said 
that punishments had been meted out to the media including the 
Nanfang Weekend [NANFANG ZHOUMO SUPPLEMENT of NANFANG RIBAO], 
Tourism Trend, Hope, Culture Square, the Dongfang Evening News 
[DONGFANG WANBAO], the Star [English-language newspaper 
published in Shanghai], the Guangdong-Hong Kong Information 
Daily [YUEGANG XINXI BAO] and the Guangzhou Youth Paper. The 
new war against "Western spiritual pollution" contradicts not 
only the nascent spirit of political reform but also Guangzhou's 
commitment to integrate its economy with the capitalistic world.

<F P=106> [By Daniel Kwan in Guangzhou and Chris Yeung] </F>
  [Text] Guangdong, the most economically dynamic region in 
China, is likely to actually benefit from the controversial tax 
revamp, this year's budget plan has revealed. The provincial 
budget as well as a Government Work Report by Governor Zhu 
Senlin will be tabled at a provincial People's Congress which 
opens in Guangzhou today. 
  In his work report, Mr Zhu is to swear allegiance to the 
central Government by pledging to implement Beijing's tax reform 
programme. He will also stick to calls for "sustained, high 
speed, and healthy" growth of the economy this year, avoiding 
phrases such as "fast-track growth". 
  The Government will reduce fixed asset investments by 10 per 
cent and cut down re-investment by enterprises by about 30 per 
cent, Mr Zhu says in his report. But he vowed to take all means 
to ensure Guangdong is one step ahead of other provinces in 
marching towards a market economy. 
  About 800 delegates arrived in Guangzhou yesterday to attend 
the Second Session of the Eighth Guangdong People's Congress. 
Although no major personnel changes are expected at the 
congress, the week-long conclave has been seen as significant as 
the drastic tax reform, which was considered the centre-piece of 
this year's economic reform, will face the test. For instance, 
delegates will be asked to endorse the controversial value-added 
tax (VAT). 
  According to conference documents, Guangdong and Beijing 
agreed to a formula on the share of revenue from VAT. Beijing 
will get 75 per cent while the remaining one-quarter goes to 
local funds. However, Guangdong will receive a yearly increase 
of rebate from Beijing to guarantee the local treasury will not 
suffer under the new package. Moreover, Beijing has also agreed 
to allow Guangdong to keep its annual increase of financial 
contribution to the central [authorities] to nine per cent. 
This was despite the fact that Guangdong achieved a 56.42 per 
cent increase of government revenue last year. 
  The tax arrangements have been seen as concessions made by 
the central authorities to the southern province, which had 
earlier been widely seen as the worst-hit region under the tax 
reform. According to the Governmenl Work Report, the economic 
growth rate for 1994 has been set at 15 per cent. The national 
target adopted by the central Government for this year is nine 
per cent. Industrial output is expected to rise 21 per cent 
while the province's agriculture will grow at five per cent. 
  While Guangdong's social retail index--a key indicator of 
inflation--jumped 18.2 per cent last year, the Governor is 
hoping to keep the figure below 12 per cent this year. Mr Zhu 
will also give a rundown of the glowing success of his province 
last year and ask the delegates for their support in pushing 
ahead the reform agenda, especially the new tax reform package. 
  Three areas--runaway fixed investment, neglect of 
agriculture 
by the government, and inflation have been singled out for 
concern this year. The report says fixed assets investments 
increased 58.5 per cent reaching a staggering 146.1 billion yuan 
(about HK$130 billion) last year. 
  Damages by deluge and typhoon also cost the province as much 
as 1 billion yuan last year. "The third [problem] is a 
relatively large increase of inflation. The social retail price 
index rose 18.2 per cent over the previous year," the report 
says. 
  However, Mr Zhu's report made no mention of a series of 
industrial accidents in Shenzhen last year, killing more than 
100 people. The report also has little to say on the chronic 
problem of inflation. Prices of grain went up by more than 40 
per cent in Guangzhou last November. The surge of prices has 
prompted the central Government to re-impose price control in 
major cities. 
  Last night the China News Service reported that the State 
Planning Commission and the State Administration of Taxation had 
recently issued a joint directive ordering the authorities to 
maintain stable prices following the implementation of tax 
reform. 
  Meanwhile, a tight budget is to be delivered by top finance 
official at the Guangdong conclave. According to a report to be 
tabled by head of the Bureau of Finance, Zeng Bingsheng, total 
revenue for the Government last year reached 34.6 billion yuan, 
11.1 billion up from the previous year. That represented a 56.4 
per cent increase. 
  Mr Zeng is to tell delegates that Guangdong is unlikely to 
suffer under the new tax scheme. The provincial Government is 
expected to have a 9.89 per cent real increase of revenue this 
year.

  [Text] Guangzhou, February 22 (CNS)--The Guangdong 
procuratorial organs have listed the cracking down on bribery 
and corruption as their main task in dealing with economic 
crimes and have concentrated their forces on the investigation 
of and dealing with big and serious cases of such kind, making 
great achievements in this sector. 
  Chief Procurator of the Guangdong Provincial People's 
Procuratorate, Mr. Wang Jun, speaking this morning at the 
provincial people's congress being held here, said that some 
4,246 economic cases including those of bribery and corruption 
were filed in the procuratorial organs at various levels in the 
province last year with 1,670 of them investigated and 1,249 of 
these involving sums of RMB 10,000 [renminbi] or more, making up 
74 percent of the total and 27.7 percent up over the year before. 
  From August to December last year, there were 905 such 
economic cases in the province involving 1,036 persons and 677 
cases involving sums of RMB 10,000 or more, 20 percent up over 
that seen in the previous seven months while those involving RMB 
one million or more were put at 29. 
  Of the cases discovered in the latter five months of last 
year, 373 were committed by party and government officials 
working in such departments as legislation, administrative 
law-enforcement and economic management, involving 394 people of 
which 19 were cadres of county or division ranks. 
  In a related development, according to the report by the 
president of the provincial higher people's court, Mr. Mai 
Chongkai, to the provincial people's congress, the people's 
courts in the province last year handled 2,400 foreign-related 
cases involving foreigners, overseas Chinese and people from 
Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan with these cases covering civilian, 
economic, marine and administrative affairs. 
  With the widening of opening to the outside world, the 
foreign-related cases in the province have been increasing 
annually with a 4.2 percent growth last year over that seen in 
the year before. 
  According to Mr. Mai, the province last year handled over 
900 
cases regarding claims of returning housing property rights by 
owners of overseas Chinese and compatriots in Hong Kong and 
Macao with all these cases being properly handled in line with 
relevant regulations and policies. 
  In order to meet the needs of opening to the outside world, 
the provincial people's court last year set up an economic court 
dealing with foreign-related cases while middle-level as well as 
grass-roots people's courts which face a relatively greater 
number of such cases also set up their corresponding organs to 
deal with such cases.

  [Text] Guangzhou, February 23 (XINHUA) -- The interests of 
workers in all enterprises in Guangdong Province, south China, 
are expected to be better protected when a new law goes into 
effect March 1. 
  Chen Bing, director of the Guangdong Federation of Trade 
Unions, said that the local law is applicable to all workers, in 
both regular and temporary employment, in enterprises of 
different ownerships under the province's administration. 
  The law will put special emphasis on workers' interests, and 
it states clearly for the first time that victims should get 
compensation, instead of merely punishing those infringing 
workers' interests, Chen said. 
  In the course of changes in the economic pattern, some 
problems concerning the relations between labor and capital have 
popped up -- basically problems concerning working time, 
payment, safety and health care, insurance and welfare, 
government officials said. 
  A random sample survey conducted by the provincial 
federation 
of trade unions among 1,500 workers indicates that 39 percent of 
the workers enter factories without signing contracts, and the 
payment in two-thirds of foreign-funded enterprises is lower 
than the yearly local average pay. 
  The survey also shows that as many as 61 percent of 
employees 
work seven days a week, and 42 percent of them work ten hours or 
more a day.

  [Text] Guangzhou, February 19 (XINHUA) -- A multi-form 
education network for compulsory, professional and adult 
education has been set up in the rural areas of Guangdong 
Province as a result of a reform program. 
  To raise the quality of rural laborers, Guangdong, a rising 
area in South China, has exerted big efforts to popularize 
nine-year compulsory education and promote anti-illiteracy 
programs among adults. 
  By the end of 1993, nine-year compulsory education was 
implemented in the province's 48 counties and prefectures. In 
the 17 pilot counties and cities for rural education reform, the 
enrollment rate of middle school students reached 95 percent in 
1992. 
  In rural education, priority is given to technical training 
in rural primary and middle schools so that the students can put 
their knowledge immediately into use. 
  Some 134 vocational schools have been set up in the 17 pilot 
counties and cities, which have helped trained 60 percent of the 
rural enterprises' employees. 
  Rural education has always stressed the combination of 
education, production and scientific research. 
  The ten vocational schools of Shunde Counties have opened 18 
courses in line with the needs in the development of rural 
enterprises and agricultural modernization. 
  In the past ten years, the schools have trained more than 
8,000 students who have become an important force in 
agricultural production and rural industry.

<F P=106> [By Daniel Kwan in Guangzhou] </F>
  [Text] Shenzhen is the best qualified Chinese city to be 
the "second Hong Kong" on the mainland, Shenzhen and Guangdong 
officials said yesterday. Li Haidong, director of Shenzhen 
People's Congress, said the congress would speed up its work so 
that Shenzhen could be the first Chinese city to establish a 
legal framework to serve the development of the "socialist 
market economy". The whole legislative process should take 
three to five years. At least 25 new laws will be introduced 
this year and many are considered unprecedented in China. 
  The director, who is in Guangzhou to attend the eighth 
Guangdong People's Congress, said these new legal codes would 
not contradict those passed by the Central and provincial 
authorities. They include a property transaction law, laws on 
partnership companies and companies with unlimited liabilities, 
social insurance law and a statue on state owned properties. 
  And Lin Ruo, chairman of Guangdong People's Congress, said 
the Shenzhen experience would soon be spread to other cities of 
Guangdong. "This is natural. Cities which have the conditions 
can soon follow Shenzhen," Mr Lin said. Building more Hong 
Kongs on the mainland was first suggested by patriarch Deng 
Xiaoping to push ahead his quasi-capitalist reform experiment. 
  According to Mr Li, the Shenzhen Congress will step up its 
supervision over the Government to make sure that all these new 
laws would be implemented. In addition, Shenzhen would also 
encourage more lawyers to set up law firms in the city to 
provide the necessary service to the public. While Mr Li 
admitted that many government officials only paid lip-service to 
the statue book, he said changes needed time. When asked about 
the industrial accidents that happened in Shenzhen last year Mr 
Li agreed they occurred because many city government officials 
lacked a "crisis consciousness". "(We've) learned a very deep 
lesson (last year)," he said. "This has helped our leaders to 
understand that on the one hand they must do a good job in 
reform and opening up, but on the other hand they have to do 
better in their management." He added the most important point 
was that administration should be anchored on a body of laws 
that is, the realisation of the rule of law. 
  Meanwhile, Mr Li said Shenzhen had had difficulties in 
maintaining social order because it was an open city. He said 
although the majority of mobile population in Shenzhen were 
law-abiding, some were bad elements. 
  Speaking on another occasion, Shenzhen Mayor, Li Youwei, 
indicated Shenzhen was the "best qualified" city in China to be 
come the second Hong Kong because it had accumulated rich 
experience in its experiment with the market system.

<F P=106> [From the "Opinion" page: "Shenzhen's New Income Allocation </F>
Is Good Example"] 
  [Text] The Shenzhen Special Zone is trying to distribute 
individuals' income in line with their investments in 
production, according to Shenzhen Special Zone Daily [SHENZHEN 
TEQU BAO]. 
  It is something new in China's mainland, which has been 
following the principle of "to each according to his work" since 
the founding of the People's Republic in 1949. 
  Today, this guideline for income distribution remains the 
mainstay in the country. 
  Under Shenzhen's new distribution system, investors shoulder 
the risks, as well as profits, of their investments. 
  No doubt, the newspaper points out, the new system does not 
repel the principle of "to each according to his work," since 
the labour force is still one of the key productive factors 
among labour, land and funds. 
  With the deepening of the market-oriented reforms, more 
Chinese people are not only aware that they can increase 
earnings with more manual and mental work, but also they are 
entitled to larger profits with more investment. 
  These investments include both money and properties. 
<H5>  Migrants </H5>
  According to the Shenzhen Special Zone Daily, local farmers 
used to have the highest income, followed by immigrant farmers, 
self-employed businessmen, enterprise employees, government 
functionaries and temporary migrants. 
  The income gaps among these groups can be mainly traced to 
their different amount of investments, says the newspaper. 
  In addition to the income earned through farmwork and 
sideline production, farmers can get interests from bank 
deposits, rent from let houses and profits from land lease. 
  By contrast, temporary migrants are only paid for manual 
labour. 
  Shenzhen's experiment is conducive to developing a market 
economy, says the daily. 
  Under the socialist market economy, the distribution of 
income is based on a market mechanism instead of the government 
monopoly; otherwise it would be hard to guarantee the fairness 
of distribution. 
  During past reforms, Shenzhen has rejected many traditional 
norms and adapted to new systems practical in a market economy. 
The new income distribution system is another step forward. 
  Many new companies in Shenzhen are foreign-funded, with the 
Chinese partners providing the land for workshops. In this way, 
the Chinese side can profit by investing capital and land. 
  This is a concrete example of the new distribution system 
and 
should be encouraged, says the newspaper. 
  It can encourage individuals to invest their surplus funds, 
land and houses into production, increasing the efficiency of 
resource allocation, improving productivity, boosting social 
wealth and creating more job opportunities, says the newspaper. 
  Also the State coffer can benefit. 
  Self-employed businesses in Shenzhen paid taxes of 314 
million yuan ($36.1 million) in 1992. 
  Encouraged by the new income distribution system, the 
region's private economy, as an engine of the local economy, has 
been advancing robustly. 
  And personal savings soared to a record high of 17.5 billion 
yuan ($2 billion) last year, the newspaper said. Meanwhile, 
more and more people lease out their houses and invest in 
industries such as securities. 
<H5>  Fortune </H5>
  Although the new system can avoid egalitarianism, efforts 
must be paid to fight against smuggling, tax dodging and 
graft-taking. 
  Policies and regulations must be enforced to guard against 
social and political chaos triggered by the ever-widening income 
disparations in the fierce market competition. 
  Since different economic sectors have increased co-operation 
and infiltration, and people's income comes from various 
sources, the management of distribution should target 
controlling the scale of individual income. 
  The sources from which people earn their income should be 
overlooked. 
  It is important to improve the management of individual 
income tax, by issuing and seriously enforcing laws on taxation, 
says the newspaper. 
  The government, aiming to bring universal prosperity to the 
Chinese, should encourage different economic sectors to boom, as 
long as they are operated within State regulations and laws, 
says the newspaper.

  [Text] Shenzhen, February 21 (XINHUA) -- An intellectual 
property rights division of Shenzhen intermediate people's court 
has recently been set up here. 
  The government of Shenzhen, one of the country's five 
special 
economic zones, has in recent years brought in a series of 
reform measures in the field of intellectual property rights. 
  The pioneering auction of new technologies and inventions 
has 
effectively promoted the application of technological and 
scientific achievements to production. 
  More and more local enterprises have stipulated that holders 
of new technology or inventors of new products can become 
shareholders of the enterprises in return. 
  However, the economic boom has also given rise to disputes 
involving intellectual property rights. 
  Shenzhen intermediate people's court handled 18 cases last 
year involving intellectual property rights. Disputes about 
industrial property rights and patent rights of foreign trade 
marks accounted for the majority. 
  The newly-founded court will strengthen protection of 
intellectual property rights more effectively, according to the 
president of Shenzhen intermediate people's court.

  [Text] Guangzhou, February 22 (XINHUA) -- The economy of 
Shantou City is now placed on a steady track, along with the 
city government's promotion of high-tech and infrastructure 
facilities, according to Mayor Zhou Rifang. 
  Last year the local gross domestic product and total 
industrial and agricultural output value reached 11.6 billion 
yuan (about 1.33 billion U.S. dollars) and 22.9 billion yuan, 
respectively, in this coastal special economic zone in south 
China's Guangdong Province, both doubling the figures for 1990. 
  The city has set up a special industrial development 
foundation to foster new and high-tech industries, backbone 
enterprises and the production of quality products. In the 
year, it completed 92 scientific and technological promotion 
projects, which are expected to turn out an added output value 
of two billion yuan. 
  With some 10,000 new township, foreign-funded, private and 
individual enterprises starting business last year, the city's 
total industrial output exceeded 20 billion yuan, up by 39 
percent over the previous year. 
  As an ancestral home of overseas Chinese, the city approved 
the setting up of 1,343 foreign-funded enterprises last year 
involving a total of 1.37 billion U.S. dollars in foreign funds. 
  With nearly 40 percent of industrial products exported, the 
city's export volume reached 1.687 billion U.S. dollars last 
year. 
  Shantou also boosted three investment areas last year, 
namely 
the Shantou Free Trade Zone, the Shantou new and high-tech 
industrial development zone and the Nanao Island experiment zone. 
  The high-tech zone introduced 65 projects involving a total 
investment of 3.1 billion yuan. 
  The city also put three billion yuan last year into the 
construction of infrastructure facilities covering airport 
expansion, docks, railway lines, highways and bridges, electric 
power, telephones and residential housing. 
  This year the city plans to put another 5.6 billion yuan 
into 
further improving its investment environment, the mayor said.

  [Text] Zhuhai has put up a wire fence to prevent migrant 
workers from pouring into the special economic zone. The 
so-called second boundary, which separates the booming zone from 
neighbouring rural counties, is 40 kilometres long and three 
metres high. 
  "There have been more migrant workers here than ever 
before," 
Zhuhai Mayor Liang Guangda said yesterday. He said more than 75 
per cent of the city's crime could be linked to such workers. 
Last year more than 240,000 migrant workers flooded into 
Zhuhai, straining the city's limited police department and 
social services, Mr Liang said. 
  However, officials in Guangdong province have indicated the 
influx of workers into the Pearl River Estuary area has been 
brought under control. A cadre at the provincial Labour Bureau 
said yesterday "things are in order" in Guangzhou. The official 
refused to give an estimate of the size of the influx, but the 
director of the province's Communications and Transport Bureau, 
Li Peiwu, said this week the number of job seekers province-wide 
was about eight per cent less than last year's figure. 
Congestion on trains had decreased because an increasing number 
of migrant workers were using special coaches chartered by their 
employers, he said. Guangdong has reached arrangements with 
nine other provinces, including Sichuan, Yunnan, Hunan and 
Henan, since last year to better control the flow of workers 
from these areas. Workers moving to Guangdong need to hold 
three types of identification before they can be employed. 
  The semi-official China News Service reported yesterday that 
eight people were killed and six injured in a collision between 
a coach and a car on the busy highway between Guangzhou and the 
special economic zone of Shantou in southern Guangdong province.

  [Text] Nanning, February 23 (XINHUA) -- The posts and 
telecommunications service of southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang 
Autonomous Region is achieving rapid progress along with the 
local economic development. 
  In 1993 the sector's turnover was 780 million yuan (over 90 
million U.S. dollars), 70 percent up over the previous year and 
ranking among the top performers in the country. 
  Last year the booming economy of Guangxi provided a 
profitable market for posts and telecommunications. 
  The business volume of the postal service increased by 22 
percent over 1992. International and domestic express mails 
were up 45.6 percent and 202 percent, respectively, over the 
previous year. 
  Postal savings bank deposits amounted to 1.5 billion yuan 
(nearly 200 million U.S. dollars)-worth by the end of the year. 
  The business volume of telecommunications services increased 
by 103 percent, which was 34 percentage points higher than the 
national average. 
  In 1993 Guangxi telephone subscribers in urban areas 
increased by 83,000, bringing the total number to 240,000. 
  Mobile phone carriers in the region reached 13,000 in 1993, 
6.2 times more than in the previous year. The total number is 
now 15,000. 
  In 1993 Guangxi invested 1.25 billion yuan in 368 
fixed-assets projects for posts and telecommunication, four 
times more than 1992. 
  Five optical-fiber cable lines have been put into operation, 
including ones from the regional capital of Nanning to 
Guangzhou, Pingxiang and Beihai. 
  The telephone operation capacity of the region's 46 cities 
and counties has been upgraded. More lines were added to 
long-distance telephone exchanges in the regional network. 
  The region has made efforts to attract foreign funds in 
developing posts and telecommunication facilities. More than 80 
million U.S. dollars in government loans from foreign countries, 
including Germany, Belgium and Finland, have been used. 
  It also signed 60 import contracts with Sweden, the United 
States, the Republic of Korea, Japan and Hong Kong, with the 
total contract value amounting to 100 million U.S. dollars. 
  Meanwhile, the region plans to invest two billion yuan this 
year in over 400 projects, including construction of a 
600,000-line program-controlled telephone exchange project, 
3,000 km of optical-fiber cable lines, and 60 mobile telephone 
stations.

  [Text] On 28 [as heard] February, the provincial personnel 
and labor department issued a circular on controlling the 
employment of migrant workers from outside Hainan. To improve 
management over recruitment of migrant workers, the circular 
stipulates the following: 
  First, until the end of March this year, no unit is allowed 
to recruit new migrant workers from outside the province. In 
cases where a unit really needs to employ migrant workers, it 
must report this to the provincial employment service center for 
approval; if a unit employs migrant workers from outside the 
province without approval, the provincial labor supervisory 
organization will, in accordance with the provincial 
government's Decree No. 4, impose a fine of 2,000 yuan on the 
employing unit per one migrant worker employed. 
  Second, the employing unit must register with the local 
labor 
department by the end of March for the migrant workers already 
working in the unit and must obtain approval for migrant 
workers' entry into Hainan for employment. As of 1 April, all 
levels of labor supervisory organizations in the province will 
conduct overall inspections. Migrant workers who do not possess 
employment approval certificates will be fined according to the 
regulations. 
  Third, in accordance with the Document No. 15, issued 
jointly 
by the provincial personnel and labor department and the 
provincial public security department this year, after migrant 
workers' employment approval certificates come into effect the 
previous employment approval certificates issued by the 
provincial personnel and labor department will be revoked on 24 
February.

  [Text] Yesterday Governor Ma Zhongchen chaired a 
provincial government executive meeting to analyze the 
province's economic situation and discuss policies. All 
departments directly under the provincial authorities were asked 
to send cadres to grass-roots units to help resolve practical 
problems. The provincial planning and economic commission, the 
provincial finance department, the provincial taxation bureau, 
and the provincial agricultural and animal husbandry department 
reported to the meeting on industrial production, revenue, and 
wheat production. 
  Since the beginning of this year, the province has 
registered 
a speedy growth in industrial production, the market has been 
brisk, and revenue has been better than expected. But there are 
also some problems, such as unideal economic results of 
enterprises, an increase in nonoperational enterprises, some 
localities' failure to issue wages, and wheat production being 
inferior to last year. 
  Governor Ma Zhongchen pointed out: There is a need to make 
great efforts to deepen reform and overcome the above 
difficulties. 
  Governor Ma Zhongchen continued: The guiding principle for 
this year's economic work is to comprehensively carry out the 
decisions of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the 
instructions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Fifth 
Provincial Henan CPC Committee, to speed up the establishment of 
the socialist market economic structure, to seize the 
opportunity, to deepen reform, to widen the scope of opening up, 
to promote development, and to maintain stability. In 
accordance with this guiding principle, an important task facing 
all levels of government is to thoroughly understand the 
situation at the grass-roots level, to bring focal points into 
prominence, and to ensure the implementation of policies. In 
the field of reform, this year all kinds of reforms will develop 
simultaneously and break through focal points, with a powerful 
reform impetus and heavy reform tasks. Now plans and proposals 
have been worked out for reforms of the enterprise system, the 
taxation and revenue system, the financial system, the 
investment system, and the foreign trade system. The most 
important thing is to seriously implement them. The provincial 
economic structural reform commission, the provincial planning 
and economic commission, and other relevant departments should 
carry out reform experiments on the establishment of a modern 
enterprise system in 100 enterprises throughout the province, 
form several guidance teams to be sent to enterprises to ensure 
the establishment of a modern enterprise system. The provincial 
finance department and the provincial taxation bureau should 
send their office personnel to different cities and prefectures 
to help with the implementation of the new taxation and 
financial system, to form a convergence between the new and old 
taxation systems, and to ensure the fulfillment of taxation and 
financial tasks. Provincial people's banks and professional 
banks should send personnel to grass-roots units for 
investigation and should raise funds through various channels to 
alleviate fund shortages. Other relevant departments should 
resolve new problems in reform in light of their specific 
conditions and promote reform in a down-to-earth manner. 
  In industrial production, we should seriously implement the 
instructions of the provincial economic work meeting, 
meticulously organize all kinds of work, and make coordinated 
efforts to resolve contradictions in work. It is necessary to 
uphold the principle of production being guided by market 
demands, to frequently adjust the product mix, to produce 
marketable products, and to improve the economic results of 
industrial products. It is necessary to guide enterprises in 
such a manner that they pay attention to their internal 
operation and strengthen management over production and 
operation. Comprehensive coordination of industrial economic 
operation should be strengthened so as to gradually form a 
coordination system and method which correspond with socialist 
market economic demands. In addition, efforts should be made to 
make up deficits and increase surpluses and to send personnel to 
major loss-incurring enterprises to help resolve their problems. 
In agriculture, localities should strengthen their management 
over wheat fields. All levels of governments should assign 
principal leaders to take charge of wheat fields. They should 
regard wheat field management as the central task in rural work 
and concentrate human and material resources on this task. It 
is necessary to resolve the peasants' difficulties in spring 
farming, to provide material service for combat against drought 
and plant diseases, as well as for wheat field management and 
drinking water supply. The departments of electric power, 
cooking oil, seeds, chemical fertilizers, and finance should 
also consider the peasants' interests and take the initiative in 
resolving the peasants' practical problems. 
  In conclusion, Governor Ma Zhongchen asked leading comrades 
at all levels to change their work style, to go to grass-roots 
units and enterprises, to stay among the masses, to go wherever 
there are difficulties to find out about their demands, to help 
resolve their problems, and to think out methods to resolve the 
difficulties in life and arrears of wages for staff members and 
workers in enterprises which have stopped production. 
  All vice governors attended and addressed the meeting.

  [Text] Financial departments in the province have taken 
measures to introuce financial structural reform, with the aim 
of strengthening People's Bank management over financial 
departments' daily operations, turning the People's Bank into a 
genuine central bank, and strengthening People's Bank management 
and supervision over financial work and foreign exchange. 
[words indistinct] They are seeking ways to turn professional 
banks into state-owned commercial banks and carrying out an 
experiment in Zhengzhou this year, after which they will 
popularize their experience in other parts of the province. 
They will separate rural credit cooperatives from agricultural 
banks. On this basis, rural cooperative banks will be built at 
the county level and above. 
  Insurance companies will be turned into insurance

  [Text] The Hubei Provincial CPC Committee held a political 
consultation meeting in Wuchang this morning to solicit the 
views of some well known non-CPC personages on a series of 
proposed personnel arrangements regarding the forthcoming Second 
Session of the Seventh Hubei Provincial Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] Committee. 
  Provincial party committee Secretary Guan Guangfu attended 
and delivered a speech at the meeting chaired by Hui Liangyu, 
provincial party committee deputy secretary and provincial CPPCC 
committee chairman. 
  On behalf of the provincial party committee, Comrade Wang 
Zhongnong, provincial party committee standing committee member, 
briefed the participants on a series of proposed personnel 
arrangements concerning the provincial CPPCC committee 
leadership. 
  Also attending and speaking at this morning's consultation 
meeting were provincial CPPCC committee leaders, provincial 
industry and commerce federation leaders, as well as some well 
known personalities without party affiliation, including Shen 
Kechang, Shi Quan, Zeng Zhonglang, Liu Jiankang, Zhou Zibai, Liu 
Zhong, Xu Guangdu, Liu Zhuqing, Xie Baoshan, Tao Yinyue, Zheng 
Longfei, Yang Zaikui, Jin Linkong, Luo Jinlian, Chen Liangcai, 
Cai Shaozhi, Wu Daihua, Tao Jinshi, Li Jishao, Zhang Huimin, 
Zhou Yunquan, and others. 
  By developing the spirit of showing utter devotion to each 
other and sharing honor and disgrace, all participants at the 
meeting exchanged frank and candid views on the proposed 
personnel arrangements in accordance with the spirit of the CPC 
Central Committee and the spirit of the Hubei Provincial CPC 
Committee. They held unanimously that the Hubei Provincial CPC 
Committee convening such a consultation meeting is undoubtedly 
of great significance in uniting all forces that can be united, 
mobilizing all positive factors that can be mobilized, and 
successfully furthering all types of work in Hubei. 
  Secretary Guan Guangfu also delivered a speech in which he 
explained to the non-CPC personages a series of work 
arrangements made by the Hubei Provincial CPC Committee for this 
year; spelt out specific requirements on the forthcoming 
provincial people's congress session and CPPCC committee 
session; and also gave an account of some relevant personnel 
arrangements. 
  Guan Guangfu said: Since the end of last year, the 
provincial party committee and people's government have made a 
series of work arrangements and worked out a number of grand 
plans for both 1994 and the next few years. The whole province 
should now strive to arrive at the following unnanimous 
understanding: It is necessary to persist in reform and carry 
on development in light of Hubei's actual conditions, under the 
guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, and in accordance with the spirit 
of the CPC Central Committee and the spirit of the Hubei 
Provincial CPC Committee. 
  Guan Guangfu pointed out: Since Comrade Deng Xiaoping made a 
series of important speeches during his south China tour last 
year, Hubei has enjoyed faster economic growth and an excellent 
momentum in economic growth. Thus, we should make every 
possible endeavor to safeguard, with one heart and one mind, 
such an excellent situation; carry on development; maintain the 
current excellent momentum of economic growth; and open up new 
vistas for, and successfully further and accelerate, Hubei's 
economic growth with an eye on further raising Hubei's economic 
efficiency. 
  Guan Guangfu noted: In order to maintain an excellent 
momentum in economic growth, it is imperative to implement to 
the letter all relevant reform measures and properly handle 
relations between reform, development, and stability. In order 
to maintain stability, it is imperative to tackle all new 
situations and new problems in a timely manner and press ahead 
with development. Reform and opening up constitute the motive 
force for development. We should strive to persist in reform 
and expand opening up this year. I hope that all democratic 
party members will join hands with us in pushing forward Hubei's 
reform and opening up. 
  Speaking of the upcoming provincial people's congress 
session 
and CPPCC committee session, Guan Guangfu asserted: This year, 
we're going to hold these two important sessions earlier than 
usual because we need to make work arrangements for this year 
ahead of schedule. The two upcoming sessions will abide by all 
the relevant legislative procedures when arranging Hubei's work 
in 1994. I hope that all the provincial people's congress 
deputies and CPPCC committee members will be able to 
conscientiously deliberate and discuss the forthcoming 
provincial government work report and work hard to turn the 
upcoming two sessions into two successful sessions marked by 
solidarity. The provincial CPPCC committee leadership will, as 
expected, be further perfected, thereby becoming more capable of 
catering to the growing needs of Hubei's CPPCC work. I hope 
that all comrades concerned will make concerted and unreserved 
efforts to attain this goal. 
  Wang Qigang and Meng Meilu, provincial CPPCC committee vice 
chairmen and some others also attended this morning's political 
consultation meeting.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Local Party Punishes Officials in </F>
Concert Con"] 
  [Text] The Party has punished two officials for 
withholding more than 1 million yuan ($114,942) raised at two 
concerts to relieve floods which claimed 33 lives and made 
thousands homeless last year. 
  Liu Jing was sacked from his post as deputy director of 
Hunan 
Province's Economic Research and Information Centre and thrown 
off the centre's Party committee. 
  Lan Jun, former manager of the Hunan Southern Commodity 
Company, was expelled from the Party. 
  A third official, Zhao Xinsheng, a deputy manager with the 
commodity company, got a severe warning from the Party. 
  However, an official with the provincial discipline 
inspection committee said yesterday they were unlikely to face 
criminal charges. 
  Liu was secretary general of the committee organizing the 
`93 
Flood and Disaster Relief Concerts held in Changsha, on last 
July 13 and 14 which were sponsored by Liu's centre, the 
commodity company and Hunan Economic News. 
  They were set up after horrific floods took a terrible toll 
of lives and property throughout the province last summer. 
  The concerts starred Hong Kong pop singers Sally Yeh and 
George Lam Chi-cheong. 
  However, newspaper reports said Liu and Lan, together with 
several of their employees, violated culture management rules by 
setting up what were actually commercial concerts and selling 
them as charity events. They drove the price of a pair of 
tickets as high as 880 yuan ($101) then persuaded various units 
to buy them. 
  The concerts made 1,384,000 yuan ($159,080). 
  However, Liu and Lan failed to hand 1.150,000 yuan 
($132,000) 
over to the provincial Civil Affairs Bureau as they had promised 
in contracts. 
  For the commodity company had previously paid 2,290,000 yuan 
($263,218), 68 percent of which came from bank loans, to a Hong 
Kong company to organize the pop stars performances. 
  The sum was well above the concerts' profits and the local 
government was left to make up the difference. 
  The provincial Auditing Bureau has extracted 810,000 yuan 
($93,103) from the Economic Research Centre's account to pay the 
provincial Civil Affairs Bureau. But another 340,000 yuan 
($39,080) has still to be recovered. 
  Since the events, the central government has decided to 
tighten regulations governing charity performances.

  [Text] Guiyang, February 22 (XINHUA)-- Mountainous Guizhou 
Province, in south-west China, has made huge strides in building 
up a comprehensive land and air transport network. 
  Yang Shouyue, director of the transportation department of 
Guizhou Province, said that it will have established a full 
transport network connecting other parts of the country by the 
end of this century. 
  The length of highways in service in the province had 
reached 
32,100 kilometers by the end of 1993, and railways had risen to 
1,481 kilometers. 
  The province is top of the league in China in terms of 
railway electrification, in part thanks to the completion of 
electrification of railroads in the province coming from 
Sichuan, Yunnan and Hunan Provinces. 
  Local air companies have opened 30 domestic services and a 
direct charter flight from Guiyang to Hong Kong. 
  The development of transport has spurred the booming of 
other 
industries. 
  The gross product of Guizhou Province increased at an 
average 
annual rate of nine percent between 1980 and 1993. 
  Rich in natural and tourist resources, Guizhou has verified 
reserves of 74 different minerals, 29 of which rank in the top 
five in China. 
  Located on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, with complex 
geographic conditions, Guizhou's economic and social progress 
had been hindered by its poor transportation facilities. 
  A survey shows that the province had only 1,950 kilometers 
of 
roads and highways when New China was founded in 1949, and even 
sparser railway, water-borne and air transport facilities. 
  The government has made great efforts to improve transport 
facilities since 1949, especially since 1978 when China began 
its national reform and opening-up policy. 
  Investment in road-building during the past 15 years topped 
1.5 billion yuan, 7.5 times the total in the previous 30 years. 
  In addition to the 8,000 kilometers of highways built during 
the past few years, construction of an international airport, 
three highways and four rail lines are under way in the province.

  [Text] Facing a good macroeconomic environment at the 
beginning of this year, the province's industry began to develop 
rapidly. By the end of January, the gross output value of 
industrial enterprises at the township level and above totaled 
23.8 billion yuan, an increase of 27 percent over the same 
period last year. Their industrial marketing value amounted to 
12.5 billion yuan, an increase of 21 percent over the same 
period of last year, and their production and marketing rate was 
90.34 percent. In January, industrial development was 
characterized by five aspects: 1) Heavy industrial development 
was good, and light industry saw a turn for the better; 2) all 
kinds of ownership developed rapidly; 3) large, medium, and 
small industrial enterprises basically materialized [words 
indistinct]; 4) most of the major industrial products direct 
accounted for by the province continued to increase; and 5) the 
production of some industrial products in the province 
accelerated, particularly the production of regional industrial 
products. 
  In January, of the 23 prefectures and cities in the 
province, 
the number of those which registered a decrease in industrial 
production reduced by six as compared with the same period of 
last year. Today, apart from Guangyuan and Aba, which has 
registered a decrease in industrial production, the industrial 
production in other areas is optimistic. For example, Chengdu's 
industrial production has increased by 37 percent and 
Panzhihua's by 29.57 percent. 
  In addition, the increase in sales of industrial products in 
all parts of the province have remained commensurate with the 
growth of their industrial production.

  [Text] Chongqing, February 21 (CNS)--According to the 
Director of the Chongqing Municipal Land Administration, Mr Gao 
Qun, Chongqing, an industrial city in Sichuan Province, has in 
recent years greatly promoted reform of its land utilization 
system with the land market developing at a considerable scale. 
  The real estate has become a newly rising industry in 
Chongqing, attracting a large number of domestic and foreign 
investors to enter into this sector. The municipal government 
on the one hand has implemented a number of favourable policies 
to stimulate and support the development of this industry and on 
the other hand, prevented and stopped the speculative activities 
in this sector through adopting effective measures with the aim 
of enabling the real estate market to operate in a normal way 
and on a standardized basis. 
  Mr. Gao said that the city had seen an increasing range of 
development for the transferring of land utilization rights and 
the utilization rights of land for business purposes had been 
transferred on the basis of payment and limited terms of 
utilization. Last year saw 111 pieces of land transferred with 
payment with a total area of 1.47 million square metres and to 
date, there have been 227 pieces of land transferred in the city 
with a total area of 5.08 million square metres, earning RMB 1.3 
billion [renminbi]. 
  The city has at the same time based the work of transferring 
and leasing of land utilization rights on legislation with the 
management over this business strengthened and the income 
recovered from land transferred in illegal ways in the past 
gradually bringing in to the government RMB 30 million collected 
in this way in the past two years. 
  In addition, the city has tightened its administration over 
the sites of the three type foreign-funded enterprises there 
with such places being used by these entities brought under 
control in an overall way with some 196 foreign-funded 
enterprises now having signed contracts with the city 
authorities on the utilization of their sites.

  [Text] Lhasa, February 18 (XINHUA) -- All temples in Tibet 
today started the annual Buddhist service of Moinlam Qenmo, the 
biggest religious festival in Tibet. 
  Today is January 8 in the Tibetan Lunar Calendar. 
  Hundreds of thousands of people from the urban Lhasa and its 
outskirts came by foot, taxi or tractors to monasteries such as 
Zhebung, Gandain, Sera and Johkang to give alms and pray. 
  At the Zhebung Monastery, over 500 monks sat in the hall of 
the temple to recite the Buddhist sutra. There were huge crowds 
of Buddhists, many of whom went among the monks to give them 
money as alms. 
  A worker from the Tibetan autonomous regional oil company 
gave the monks a huge sum of money and told XINHUA that he came 
with two wishes: namely a wish for good luck for all the members 
of his family and a wish for God's protection of the soul of his 
late father. 
  Leading members of various departments of the Tibetan 
autonomous regional government also went to the temples to 
prepare food for the lama monks and the Buddhists. The regional 
government allocated a total of 150,000 yuan for the event, 
according to a government official. 
  Moinlam Qenmo, meaning summons ceremony, dates back to 1409, 
the year Tsong Kapa, founder of the Yellow Sect of Tibetan 
Lamaism, sponsored the first such event. The Buddhist service 
will reach its peak in a week's time, on January 15 of the 
Tibetan calendar.

  [Text] Yunnan Province's animal husbandry has developed to 
a certain scale. Now there are more than 60,000 households 
specialized in animal husbandry, of which 44,000 households each 
can produce more than 10 head of cattle annually. Last year the 
province's total output value for animal husbandry amounted to 
6.6 billion yuan, a major industry, second only to the planting 
of crops. 
  In the last few years, price increases in animal husbandry 
products, as well as market demand, have encouraged peasants to 
develop animal husbandry. They have broken away from old 
conventions, expanded the breeding scale, reduced production 
costs, and improved product quality. Governments at all levels 
also have formulated preferential policies and measures, built a 
large number of animal husbandry production bases, and provided 
priority treatment for specialized households, thus creating 
conditions for the development of animal husbandry. 
  Animal husbandry scientific and technological departments 
have exercised an economic contract responsibility system and 
other methods. In the rural areas, they have introduced good 
breeds of livestock, mixed fodder, medical treatment, and 
preventive medicine. They have introduced a fine breed of pigs 
to pig breeding bases, as well as grass planting methods and 
refined fodder to mountainous areas, thus increasing livestock 
production and improving economic results.

Li Xinnian (2621 2450 1628): "Leaders of the Beijing Municipal 
CPC Committee Talk With 10 Outstanding Communist Party Members"] 
  [Excerpts] A few days ago, Chen Xitong, secretary of the 
municipal party committee; and Chen Guangwen, deputy secretary 
of the municipal party committee, invited the municipality's 10 
outstanding communist party members to a forum to carefully 
listen to their opinions and suggestions and to discuss with 
them the great matters of how to strengthen and improve party 
building in the course of developing the socialist market 
economy and of how to promote reform and development. [passage 
omitted] 
  At the forum, in line with their working, ideological, and 
social reality, the 10 outstanding communist party members set 
forth their opinions and suggestions on bringing into play the 
communist party members' exemplary role in the new situation, 
strengthening the party organizational work, improving spiritual 
civilization, strengthening the ideological and educational 
work, and fostering an accurate world outlook and an accurate

members. The selection of 10 outstanding communist party 
members from among one million members is a great matter of 
Beijing. By disseminating the excellent deeds of the 10 
outstanding party members, we have educated the party members 
and promoted party building. So, we should also continue to 
disseminate the advanced thinking and deeds of the 10 
outstanding party members; the lofty ideals, sentiment, and 
morality of communist party members; an accurate world outlook; 
and an accurate outlook on life so as to further foster a new 
brilliant image for communist party members. 
  Chen Xitong said: Today, we invite you to this forum to 
mainly discuss the great matter of strengthening party building 
in the new situation and the great matter of promoting reform 
and development. Your opinions are conducive to the work of the 
municipal party committee and the improvement and enhancement of 
party building. While talking about the building of party 
grass-roots branches, some comrades maintained that the party is 
likened to a big tree and the grass-roots party organizations 
are likened to the root of the tree. So long as the grass-roots 
organizations are well built will the party have powerful 
vitality and combat effectiveness. This opinion is very good. 
We should realistically strengthen the building of grass-roots 
party organizations, including those in such new spheres as high 
scientific and technological units and three types of 
foreign-funded enterprises; and bring into better play the 
functions of grass-roots party organizations. After election of 
new leading bodies, the districts and counties in the 
municipality should strengthen the building of grass-roots party 
organizations, particularly backward party branches. 
  Chen Xitong said: Under the present situation that the 
planned economic system is being replaced by the socialist 
market economic system, we should continue to persist in the 
principle of "taking a two-hand approach and being sure that 
both hands are tough," further upgrade our understanding, adopt 
effective measures, strengthen the improvement of spiritual 
civilization, and strengthen the ideological education. We 
should adopt various forms, that the masses are likely to see 
and hear, to strengthen the ideological and political work. It 
is necessary to disseminate an accurate world outlook and an 
accurate outlook on life. We should learn from the 10 
outstanding communist party members, foster a great lofty ideal, 
give no thoughts to personal gains and losses, persistently 
serve the people wholeheartedly, and fight for making the 
country strong and building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. 
  Chen Xitong urged that in the new year, the 10 outstanding 
communist party members should do their jobs well, bring the 
communist party members' exemplary role into play, and make new 
progress in various spheres. 
  Chen Guangwen praised that the 10 outstanding communist 
party 
members are the banners and models of the municipal party member 
contingent. He urged that the 10 outstanding communist party 
members should cherish their glory, accept trials, set more 
strict demands on themselves, bring their exemplary vanguard 
role into better play, and make greater contributions to the 
setup of the socialist market economic system and the 
improvement of the spiritual and material civilizations.

<F P=106> [By reporter Mao Jing (3029 0079): "Beijing Holds Meeting </F>
of Leading Cadres of Institutions of Higher Learning"] 
  [Excerpts] The municipal meeting of leading cadres of 
institutions of higher learning concluded on 3 February. The 
meeting set forth that in 1994 the institutions of higher 
learning should emancipate the mind, firmly grasp favorable 
opportunities, accelerate the pace of reform, make positive 
development, and maintain stability. This year, the 
institutions of higher learning in the municipality should 
comprehensively carry out reform; make a breakthrough in 
cooperatively running schools, developing higher vocational and 
technical education, reforming the enrollment and employment 
systems, and socializing the reserve service work; and further 
strengthen and improve party building and the ideological and 
political work. 
  Li Lanqing, vice premier of the State Council, was present 
at 
the meeting. He extended Spring Festival greetings to all 
teaching and administrative staff members of the institutions of 
higher learning in the municipality. He said: The Beijing 
Municipal party committee and government have paid high 
attention to the educational work and have also completed a lot 
of concrete deeds. I express my heartfelt thanks to them. In 
regard to the development of moral education, he said that we 
should strengthen the reform and improvement of the classes on 
Marxist theory and particularly study Comrade Mao Zedong's 
several philosophic works and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. It is 
necessary to strengthen education on patriotism, socialism, 
collectivism, modern history, and contemporary history. In the 
course of conducting education on the national situation, we 
should stress education on the current situation. It is 
necessary to conduct education on the traditional virtues of 
China, moral education, and education on the legal system. 
  Chen Xitong, secretary of the municipal party committee, 
stressed that the institutions of higher learning should 
strengthen party building and ideological and political work. 
He said: Institutions of higher learning should rely on the 
leadership of the party to achieve their work. Only when party 
building is strengthened will we be able to strengthen the work 
of teachers and students and to overcome the situation of firmly 
grasping one aspect while neglecting the other. Although the 
construction of spiritual civilization is strengthened, we have 
not done enough in this regard. It is dangerous if we do not 
continue to strengthen the construction of spiritual 
civilization. We should particularly strengthen the leadership 
of the party. Universities and colleges should strengthen the 
construction of the leading bodies at various levels and 
ideological and theoretical work. We will possibly come across 
many difficulties in the course of strengthening party building 
and ideological and political work. The municipal party 
committee and the municipal government will continue to award 
the institutions of higher learning advanced in party building 
and ideological and political work and continue to help 
institutions of higher learning eliminate difficulties. Chen 
Xitong also extend festive greetings to the teaching and 
administrative staff of the institutions of higher learning in 
the municipality. [passage omitted] 
  Li Zhijian, deputy secretary of the municipal party 
committee, chaired and addressed the meeting. Zhang Xiaowen, 
vice minister of the state education commission, introduced the 
participants to the reform situation of the institutions of 
higher learning in the country. Hu Zhaoguang, vice mayor of the 
municipality, introduced the municipality's general ideas for 
the development and reform of higher education and declared the 
municipal party committee and government's preparations for 
doing concrete deeds for the development and reform of higher 
education. On behalf of the educational work committee of the 
municipal party committee and the municipal higher education 
bureau, Chen Dabai, vice chairman of the municipal committee of 
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, made a 
speech at the meeting. Sun Yongfu, vice minister at the 
Ministry of Railways; and Tao Xiping, vice chairman of the 
municipal people's congress standing committee, were also 
present at the meeting. During the meeting, the leading cadres 
of the institutions of higher learning also visited Tongxian 
County, one of the country's 100 economically powerful counties, 
to understand the rural economic reform and development 
situation.

  [Text] Beijing, February 23 (CNS) -- The total number of 
labourers pouring into Beijing from elsewhere in the country is 
close to one million and Beijing Railway Station is seeing 
60,000 to 70,000 of them arriving from all directions every day 
in recent times, according to the municipal public security 
bureau. 
  As long ago as 1986, a large number of labourers from 25 
provinces and cities in China began pouring into the capital in 
search of work in such industries as construction, environmental 
work and coal. Of the 1.5 million [figure as received] 
labourers coming from elsewhere, nearly one million of them live 
in the capital on a more or less permanent basis. Some 800,000 
of them are engaged in various kinds of economic activities with 
300,000 of them working in construction on such projects as the 
construction of buildings, 81 flyovers and 3,000 kilometres of 
roads. Such labourers from outside the capital are also engaged 
in production, processing and repair services. 
  Apart from those engaged in the urban area, there are yet 
another 200,000 of them in the suburban areas engaged in 
agriculture, hand-finished products and domestic service.

  [Text] At present, the situation of honesty among party 
members and cadres has been greatly improved and the condition 
is better than that of the previous years. On 29 January, after 
listening to briefings given by the provincial Discipline 
Inspection Commission and relevant departments on keeping 
themselves honest and clean during the Spring Festival and on 
consolidating the achievements in anticorruption struggle, Cheng 
Weigao, secretary of the provincial party committee, pointed 
out: Although expected achievements have been made in the 
anticorruption struggle, we still need to do lots of work to 
consolidate and develop this hard-earned achievements. Although 
some passive and corrupt phenomena and unhealthy trends have 
been screened and straightened out, they will reappear if we 
slightly slacken our efforts in this aspect. Particularly, the 
unhealthy trends of using public funds to entertain guests and 
send gifts, giving money or coupons as gifts, and arbitrarily 
issuing bonuses or articles will occur very easily during the 
Spring Festival period. Party committees and governments at all 
levels must never lower their guard. 
  Li Zhanshu, member of the standing committee of the 
provincial party committee and secretary general, also listened 
to the briefings. 
  Cheng Weigao stressed: This year is for carrying out package 
reform with breakthroughs in key areas, and all reform tasks 
will be very complicated and heavy. If leading cadres at all 
levels can keep themselves honest and clean, maintain close ties 
with the masses, and have profound affection towards the masses, 
all reform measures that issued will be supported by the masses, 
and the problems that appeared will be easily solved, the 
political situation will be stable, and reform will be smoothly 
carried out. Party committees and governments at all levels 
should always attend to the work of combating corruption and 
maintaining honesty and grasp it as a political task. 
Currently, it is necessary to attend to honesty work during the 
Spring Festival period. 
  Cheng Weigao reaffirmed: Leading cadres at all levels should 
strictly implement the five stipulations of the party Central 
Committee on keeping clean and self-disciplined and the "10 
prohibitions" proposed by the provincial party committee. 
During the Spring Festival period, all localities, departments, 
and units are not allowed to send native or speical products, 
purchasing certificates, money or all sorts of gifts to the 
higher organs or leading cadres; higher organs or leading cadres 
should decline the offer of gifts or money from the lower 
levels, and should not ask for gifts from them. All units are 
not allowed to use public funds for lavish dining and wining or 
to engage in extravagance and waste; and during the Spring 
Festival period, all tea parties, receptions, forums, and 
gatherings must be held in frugal way. All localities, 
departments, and units must not violate the stipulations and 
issue bonuses, subsidies, purchasing certificates, and articles 
under any pretext or forms. All people are not permitted to use 
public funds for holding recreation activities that spend lots 
of money. Appropriate entertainments may be held during the 
festive period, but we must guard against the appearance of 
unhealthy influence. Party members and cadres, particularly the 
leading cadres, should not be allowed to participate in any kind 
of gambling, to engage in feudal or superstitious activities, or 
to drink excessively. 
  Cheng Weigao called on leading cadres at all levels to set 
examples with their own conduct, take the lead in maintaining 
honesty, realistically attend to the honest administration of 
their respective localities, departments, and units during the 
festive period, establish the responsibility system, and enable 
one level to take charge of the work of the next level and 
assume responsibility. If serious problems emerge in a 
locaility, a department, or a unit, we should first pursue the 
responsibility of the principal leading cadres. 
  Cheng Weigao said in conclusion: Even though the demands we 
have set forth are very clear and definite, some cadres who are 
unaware of them will still engage in unhealthy practice because 
the legal system is not perfect and there are loopholes in 
management. The discipline inspection and supervision 
departments at all levels should strengthen supervision and 
inspection, immediately organize strength to investigate the 
problems reported by the masses and the problems discovered, and 
deal with them strictly in a timely manner.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Zhedong (1728 0772 2767): "Strengthen </F>
Macroeconomic Control, and Deepen Structural Reform"] 
  [Text] We should accelerate and deepen the reform of 
planning and investment systems, positively and steadily press 
forward the reform of pricing system, and strengthen and improve 
the macroeconomic control. This is the central topic of the 
regional planning work conference held on 26 January. Qian 
Fenyong, Liu Zhen, and Song Zhimin attended the conference. 
Song Zhimin, vice chairman of the region, made a speech at the 
conference, urging for efforts to appropriately handle the 
relations in the following five aspects in terms of 
macroeconomic control. 
  The relations among reform, development, and stability. 
Development constitutes the foundation of social stability, 
reform instills vitality to development, and only by maintaining 
a stable social environment can we concentrate our energy on 
pressing forward reform, opening up, and economic development. 
When making arrangements for economic work, all leagues, 
cities, and departments should pay attention to the linking of 
the relations between reform and stability and relations between 
reform and development. 
  The relations between speed and efficiency. The rapid 
development of the economy must be founded on the basis of 
having a good sale and efficiency and being permitted by 
financial and material resources. Both when initiating new 
projects and renovating old enterprises, we should give top 
priority to good market and efficiency. If successfully 
transformed, the natural resources advantages may be turned into 
economic advantages; and if poorly transformed, the natural 
resources advantages may become burdens. In addition, we should 
also correctly handle the relations between the newly initiated 
projects and the endeavor of tapping the potential of existing 
projects. We should pay attention to the major projects that 
exert great influence on economic development, and should, 
moreover, pay attention to the projects that consume less 
investment, need short construction period, and yield quick 
results. This year, the capital construction investment can 
only be made in the projects that are at the winding-up stage 
and will soon be put into production in the right order of 
importance and urgency. 
  The relations between the whole and the part. The 
enhancement of the macroeconomic control capacity of the state 
is conducive to the minority nationalities areas in the region, 
and, similarly, the enhancement of the macroeconomic control 
capacity of our region is also conducive to various leagues, 
cities, banners, and counties. Therefore, we hope that all 
localities and all departments will take the overall situation 
into account and will subject themselves to the overall 
situation when their partial interests are contradictory to the 
overall interest. 
  The relations between economic development and social 
development. In the course of accelerating the region's 
economic development, we must make overall arrangements for and 
give all-round consideration to the development of such social 
undertakings as education, culture, and social security. 
  The relations between economic construction and people's 
livelihood. On the basis of developing the economy and 
increasing labor productivity, we should continuously increase 
the income of urban and rural residents. This is the only way 
to better mobilize the initiative of the numerous people in 
production, to reinforce the unity among the people of all 
nationalities, to enhance the cohesive force to develop the 
economy, and to effect an even faster and better development of 
the economy. In particular, we should show concern for the 
lives of the masses in the localities and units that have 
difficulties and should work out methods to solve problems for 
them. 
  Song Zhimin stressed: We should re-fix the position of 
planning work, readjust functions of planning work, shift work 
priorities, improve planning forms and methods, and enable 
planning work to play an even important, positive, and effective 
role. First, we should actually attend to the reform of 
planning and investment structures. We should shift, as quickly 
as possible, the plan management functions to researching 
strategies, formulating plans, exercising macroeconomic control, 
maintaining the aggregate economic balance, working out 
industrial policies, cultivating markets, building key projects, 
and giving coordinated service. With market as the foundation, 
we should give full play to the fundamental role of the market 
in allocating natural resources, strengthen the research and 
comprehensive coordination of the macroeconomic policies, give 
full play to the important role of the planning means in the 
macroeconomic control, emancipate the mind to broaden the field 
of vision, positively pioneer the new sphere of the planning 
work that is commensurate with the development of market 
economy, and establish scientific planning system. Second, we 
should rapidly draw up the medium- and long-term plan for 
development of the region in line with the regional party 
committee's strategic demand for "joining the country's 
forefront." This year, planning commissions at all levels, 
together with departments concerned, should concentrate their 
energy on researching and drawing up the Ninth Five-Year Plan, 
the medium- and long-term plan for the region's economic and 
social development in 2010, the plan for making the people 
relatively better-off, the plan for supporting and developing 
the poor areas, the plan on development of guiding industries, 
the plan on development of regional economy, and the plan on 
conservation of national territories. Third, we should pay 
attention to the work concerning the aggregate economic balance. 
We should emphatically arrange for the production and supply of 
means of agricultural production, for the linking of the growing 
scale of major cash crops with the production ability of light 
industrial enterprises, and for the balance between railway 
transportation and power supply capacities and the demands of 
the production of various trades. Fourth, we should 
successfully control and guide the key links of economic 
development and make good pre-phase preparations for major 
projects in order to promote the smooth construction of key 
projects.

<F P=106> [By reporters De Bin (1795 2430) and Jian Jun (1696 6511) </F>
and Correspondent Wei Manchang (7279 3341 2490): "Inner 
Mongolia Defines Principles for Guiding 1994 Financial Work"] 
  [Text] "Deepen reform of the financial system, intensify 
supervision over financial work, and further improve efficiency 
in using and managing capital." This is the general principle 
for guiding the 1994 financial work as set forth at the regional 
financial work conference on 27 January. Qian Fenyong and Song 
Zhimin, leaders of the region, attended the conference. Song 
Zhimin gave a speech at the conference. 
  According to the financial work principles as set forth at 
the national financial work conference and in line with actual 
regional conditions, the regional financial department should 
carry out its work in line with the following work priorities: 
  Strictly control aggregate credits. The state-owned 
commercial banks should engage in the management of the 
proportions of assets and liabilities according to the amounts 
of loans, control the targets for the management of the 
proportions of liabilities, and check on legal persons, that are 
mainly regarded as a unit. Policy-lending banks should strictly 
handle the defined policy-lending business. In regard to the 
management of credits, the policy- lending banks should carry 
out the principle of "planned management, credits for fixed 
targets, management on the premise of maintenance of capital, 
and self-balance;" and grant loans according to the state-fixed 
targets. Except for the temporary use of capital, the central 
bank must not offer funds. It is necessary to cut the 
relationship between policy-lending loans and the basic currency 
of the central bank, carry out the management of the proportions 
of assets and liabilities among the non-banking financial 
organizations according to different actual conditions, continue 
to strictly control the aggregate foreign exchange loans, and 
simultaneously readjust the proportions of the foreign exchange 
structure and the property structure. 
  Try every possible means to increase bank savings and strive 
to expand credit resources. All banks and urban and rural 
credit cooperatives should continue to adopt various kinds of 
positive measures to organize and assimilate bank savings, 
strive to increase both urban and rural savings deposits over 
1993, and increase at least 5 billion yuan of savings deposits 
this year. The situation that enterprises registered a negative 
increase in savings deposits should be changed. We should exert 
efforts to improve service to assimilate savings deposit but 
must not adopt the improper means, such as wantonly and 
perfunctorily raising interest rates to attract savings 
deposits. Various levels of people's banks and specialized 
banks should strengthen the management and examination of 
interest rates. Those violating regulations governing the 
management of interest rates should sternly be investigated and 
handled. At the time of firmly organizing forces to increase 
savings deposits, we should exert great efforts to flexibly use 
existing credits and increase usable capital. 
  Optimize the structure of loans and ensure the supply of 
capital for key items. When assimilating savings deposits and 
flexibly using existing capital, we should use the newly 
increased portion of loans to meet the needs of key projects for 
the region's economic development. We should positively support 
agricultural and livestock production, ensure the supply of 
funds for purchasing farm and livestock products, and positively 
support the development of energy resources and transportation 
service and the production of major raw materials for industrial 
use. It is necessary to support the supply of funds for state 
key construction projects; the development of high value-added 
products, readily marketable products, and the industries and 
products with high capability to create foreign exchange; the 
supply of the funds for the state-owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises with good economic results and the foreign export 
trade enterprises; and the implementation of the 
support-the-poor plan in the Eighth Five-Year Plan period. 
Enterprises should be guided to enter markets and join 
competition. We should concentrate funds and select a group of 
town and township enterprises and key projects to accelerate 
their technological transformation. To ensure the fulfillment 
of the above targets, we should continue to carry out the 
principle of supporting the good, controlling the bad, and 
having both guarantee and control. 
  Continuously consolidate the financial order and 
realistically strengthen supervision and control over financial 
work. Last year, the region made positive achievements in 
straightening out financial order. On the basis of the 
achievements made last year, this year, we should continue to 
expand achievements. It is necessary to continuously implement 
the regulations on consolidating financial order as stipulated 
last year. It is necessary to resolutely ferret out inter-bank 
loans that were granted in violation of regulations. Loans that 
cannot be withdrawn should clearly be investigated and the 
responsible persons should be called to account. Economic 
entities run by the banks themselves should be separated from 
the banks. Under the unified leadership of the local party 
committees and governments, the people's banks at various levels 
should conscientiously and resolutely eliminate the problems of 
arbitrarily collecting funds. 
  Positively support enterprises to transform the managerial 
mechanisms and to conscientiously return the credits to the 
banks. The financial departments should adopt a positive 
attitude to help enterprises change their managerial mechanisms 
and engage in reform and also pay attention to analyzing and 
grasping the new situation and new problems cropping up in the 
course of replacing the old system with the new in an effort to 
avoid losing state credits and assets. 
  Strictly control loans for fixed assets. It is necessary to 
continuously carry out mandatory plans for granting loans for 
fixed assets. No one is allowed to grant loans for fixed assets 
without approvals. People's banks at various levels should 
strengthen the examination and auditing of loans for fixed 
assets. Banking units and leaders of units that violate 
policies should be called to account.

  [Text] On the morning of 22 February, Gao Dezhan, 
secretary of the municipal party committee, inspected (Baiyang) 
Tianjin Steel Product Wholesale Market to conduct investigation 
and study for accelerating the cultivation and development of 
Tianjin's market system. Comrade Gao Dezhan stressed: We 
should exert great efforts in accelerating the cultivation and 
development of the market system, and build, through endeavors 
in this and the next few years, 10 commodity and key elements 
markets that are influential in northern China and even all over 
the country in Tianjin in order to make Tianjin truly become the 
commercial, trading, and banking center of northern China. 
  Together with Zheng Zhiying, standing committee member and 
secretary general of the municipal party committee, and with 
responsible persons of pertinent departments, commissions, and 
bureaus under the municipal party committee and the municipal 
government, Gao Dezhan inspected the situation of wholesales at 
spot prices and the national spot market network of this 
wholesale market. Gao Dezhan spoke highly of the work of this 
wholesale market and happily beat gongs to mark the opening of 
the 128th business day of the market. Then, Gao Dezhan listened 
to the work reports made by responsible comrades of materials 
and goods groups, the wholesale market, and other pertinent 
departments. 
  Gao Dezhan stressed: Accelerating reform of structures in 
the circulation sphere and cultivating and developing a market 
system constitutes the basic link of the establishment of the 
socialist market economic structure, the major manifestation of 
omnidirectional opening to domestic places and the outside 
world, and an extremely important work to build Tianjin into the 
commercial, trading, and banking center of northern China and to 
give full play to the role of the municipality as the city 
directly under the jurisdiction of the central authorities. 
  Gao Dezhan definitely pointed out: Through the endeavor in 
this and the next years, Tianjin should build 10 commodity and 
key elements markets that are influential in northern China and 
throughout the country. This should be considered the major 
objective that is to be attained through hard work in the fields 
of reform, opening up, and economic development of the whole 
municipality. 
  Gao Dezhan pointed out: To attain this objective, we must 
pay attention to the work in the following three aspects: 
  First, we should successfully build markets. We should 
perfect commodity markets, vigorously develop key elements 
markets, pay attention to building both hardware and software 
items, and positively develop the professional intermediate 
organizations that facilitate the cultivation of markets. 
  Second, we should make good use of markets. We should have 
commodities on every market, increase the turnover of goods, 
increase transaction volume, and engage in large-scale 
transaction in flexible manner, extend business to northern 
China and even the whole country in order to attract traders 
from all over the country. 
  Third, we should successfully manage markets. We should 
perfect market rules and regulations, protect fair competition, 
establish good order, strengthen control over markets, and 
ensure normal operations. In sum, Tianjin should run as many 
markets as possible, run large-scale and high-level markets, 
strive to make itself the center of northern China and the first 
class municipality of the country, and link itself with the 
international markets. 
  According to another source, on the morning of 22 February, 
Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, beat the 
gong at the transaction hall of Beiyang Tianjin Steel Product 
Wholesale Market to mark the start of the 128th business day of 
this market. Since its opening, this market, the largest steel 
product market in the municipality which supplies the whole 
country, had transactions totaling 6.19 million tonnes of steel 
products and 21.1 billion yuan in renmenbi. Gao Dezhan wished 
the market increasingly brisk business this year.

  [Text] The provincial on-the-spot forum on the 
implementation of the strategy for becoming rich ahead of others 
was held on 19 February. 
  Some provincial leaders, including Ma Guoliang, Wang 
Xianmin, 
and Sun Kuiwen, were present at the forum. Leaders of the 
cities of Shangzhi, Suihua, Zhaodong, Shuangcheng, Nehe, Fujin, 
Acheng, and Hailin; Mulin and Hulan Counties; and 
provincial-level departments concerned introduced the 
experiences in becoming rich ahead of others and the situation 
of supporting the rich counties to seek wealth. Sun Weiben, 
secretary of the provincial party committee, made a speech at 
the forum. Ma Guoliang, deputy secretary of the provincial 
party committee, also made a speech. 
  Sun Weiben pointed out in his speech that the nine counties 
and cities should lose no opportunities to quicken the pace of 
industrialization and regard it as a strategic priority of 
development. 
  The strategy of being the first to become rich was set forth 
by the provincial party committee and the provincial government 
at the beginning of 1993 with a view to promoting the 
development of the county-level economy. Over the past, these 
nine cities and counties have firmly implemented the strategic 
arrangements of the provincial party committee and the 
provincial government, worked in line with their different 
actual conditions, fruitfully carried out their work, and 
rapidly promoted the economic development. Their overall 
economic development level is higher than the national average. 
These nine cities' and counties' GNP in 1993 rose by 20.7 
percent over 1992 and was 15.8 percent higher than the 
provincial growth rate. Hulan County, which had not been put on 
the list of nine rich counties, also made sustained and fast 
increases in the rural economy and industrial production. So, 
this county was listed as one of the rich counties at this forum. 
  Comrade Sun Weiben pointed out: Viewing the provincial 
situation, we know that industry is a weak link in the 
development of the county-level economy. When compared with the 
national average level, these nine rich cities and counties 
still have such problems as industry accounts for a small 
proportion, the development speed is slow, and the economic 
results are poor. If they do not rapidly make up the deficiency 
in industry, it will be difficult for them to take the lead in 
becoming rich and the pace of stepping toward the target of 
becoming fairly well-off will slow down. Therefore, in line 
with the thinking of the socialist market economy, the rich 
counties should accelerate the pace of industrializing the 
county-level economy and concentrate their energy on vigorously 
developing town and township enterprises. In regard to the 
selection of projects, we should persistently link the projects 
with less investment, fast efficiency, and short construction 
periods with key large-scale and export-oriented projects with 
high starting points. In regard to the construction of 
projects, we should carry out the legal person responsibility 
system. Simultaneously, we should attend to the reform and 
reconstruction of the existing enterprises. Persistently in 
line with the principle of appropriate concentration, we should 
pay equal attention to the construction of key projects, small 
industrial zones, and small towns. 
  He said: To ensure the sound development of the county-level 
economy, we should take the path of making trade, science, 
agriculture, and industry a coordinate process. In regard to 
the organizational leadership, we should eliminate the division 
of administrative work, break the barriers between different 
regions and between different departments, and exercise 
organizational leadership according to the principle of systems 
engineering. In regard to the distribution of benefits, we 
should organize and set up a community of benefits in line with 
the principle of equally sharing benefits and risks. Key 
enterprises should concentrate efforts on reforming the property 
right system, conducting the technological transformation, 
improving management, and offering serialized service. 
  Ma Guoliang, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee, urged that the rich counties should thoroughly 
understand the situation, firmly attend to work, unswervingly 
implement the strategies of becoming rich ahead of others, take 
the readjustment of the economic structure as a priority to map 
out a new pattern for county-level economic development, deepen 
the reform of the county- level economy, quicken the pace of 
entering the market economy, increase the dynamics of 
introducing businessmen and capital, support the fast 
development of the county-level economy, and accurately handle 
the relationship between reform and development and stability, 
and concentrate energy to make development.

  [Text] At the provincial on-the-spot forum on carrying 
forward the strategy of helping poor counties shake off poverty 
which ended yesterday, Sun Weiben, secretary of the provincial 
party committee, said: To end poverty, poor counties must turn 
their eyes inward, stand on their own feet to become stronger, 
give a free hand to grass roots, enterprises, and peasants, 
rapidly guide them to the market, and strengthen the ability of 
markets to survive and develop themselves in the course of 
competition. 
  Attending this forum were provincial leaders, including Ma 
Guoliang and Sun Kuiwen, leaders of the province's 11 poor 
counties and the cities and districts in these counties, and 
responsible persons of provincial level departments concerned. 
  Comrade Sun Weiben pointed out: In the process of acquiring 
the new market economic structure, the policies, and scope and 
degree of economic benefits, such as reducing or remitting 
taxes, increasing loans, and striving for parity-price means of 
production, will be gradually reduced. If the ideas of helping 
poor counties shake off poverty and become prosperous still 
remain in the stage of asking for money, materials, and policies 
from the higher authorities, it will be very difficult to carry 
out the work of enabling poor counties to shake off poverty and 
become prosperous. The establishment of the new market economic 
structure has brought new opportunity for this work. If we 
promptly adjust our ideology and shift the planned economy to a 
market economy, we will be able to more rapidly attain the aim 
of enabling poor counties to end poverty and become prosperous. 
He said: The key to success is to do a good job in the two 
aspects of decontrolling and invigorating the markets and 
guiding enterprises to enter the market. To invigorate the 
markets, we must eliminate the obstacles. If we decontrol the 
management of thousands upon thousands of markets and enable 
them to develop production and create wealth independently, we 
will have no problem in helping poor counties end poverty. The 
problem now is that the traditional leadership concepts and 
management system have tied the hands of peasants and 
enterprises. When carrying out work, peasants and enterprises 
have to ask for favors from various departments, and if they 
fail to do so, they will be unable to carry out their work. 
There are too many official procedures and shackles. The way 
to solve this is to deepen reform, change government functions, 
and streamline and reorganize organs. Government departments 
should not manage things that are within the framework of the 
decision-making power of enterprises and laborers. Departments 
which have no work to do after changing functions and delegating 
powers should be merged into other organs or abolished. Those 
who extort money from enterprises and peasants or create 
difficulties for them should be investigated and handled upon 
discovery. He said: We must pave the road and build bridges 
for enterprises and peasants to enter the market. Since 
peasants have engaged in the natural economy and enterprises in 
the product economy for a long time, they cannot adapt 
themselves to the market as soon as it is decontrolled. 
Particularly, the quality of enterprises and peasants are 
relatively lower in poor counties. The contradictions between 
the scattered small production units and large markets are very 
prominent. It does not mean that the governments have nothing 
to do or that they have taken on an attitude of noninterference 
after creating benefits for the markets. They should guide 
thousands and thousands of peasant households and enterprises 
into the market and give prominence to the intermediate service 
work for peasants and enterprises. Comrade Sun Weiben noted: 
To help poor counties, we should adopt permanent measures, 
focus the work on supporting poor counties by carrying out 
explorative work and enhancing their ability to survive and 
develop under market conditions, relatively concentrate efforts 
on helping poor counties carry out some explorative pillar items 
in agricultural and industrial production, and enhance their 
self- development function. In addition to studying and 
formulating regular policies to help and support poor counties, 
we should also issue some relatively supportive policies in line 
with the explorative pillar industries and projects they have 
carried out. In formulating policies to help and support poor 
counties, the general guideline is to try to the utmost to 
decontrol enterprises. 
  At the forum, Vice Governor Sun Kuiwen summed up the 
situation of carrying out the strategy of helping poor counties 
across the province shake off poverty and become prosperous and 
set forth demands on future work. He said: Since the 
convocation of the provincial on-the-spot meeting on helping 
poor counties shake off poverty held in Lindian County last 
year, the strategy of helping poor counties shake off poverty 
has been carried out in an all-round manner. Last year, the 
total output value of 11 poor counties increased 13.7 percent 
over that of the previous year, higher than the provincial 
average by 8.8 percentage point; their financial revenue 
increased 13.4 percent, higher than the province's county 
average level; and the average per-capita income of people in 
the rural areas increased 25.5 percent, higher than the 
provincial average by 17.1 percentage point. He called on poor 
counties across the province to strengthen confidence in shaking 
off poverty and becoming prosperous, deeply carry out the 
strategy of helping them shake off poverty, fully and rationally 
develop and use land resources, steadily develop large-scale 
agriculture, unceasingly raise the income of peasants, actively 
develop county-run industry, and continue to expand local 
financial resources. He called for efforts to further enhance 
consciousness and initiative in carrying out the strategy of 
helping poor counties shake off poverty, continue to support 
poor counties with policies, organize social efforts to jointly 
carry out this strategy, and strive to fundamentally change the 
outlook of poor counties after several years of efforts.

  [Text] Harbin, February 19 (XINHUA) -- Northeast China's 
Heilongjiang Province recorded a remarkable growth in its export 
of farm and sideline products last year, which amounted to over 
500 million U.S. dollars, accounting for 27.4 percent of its 
total export volume. 
  Among the 21 major kinds of export commodities that earned 
at 
least 10 million U.S. dollars each in 1993, 14 were farm and 
sideline products. 
  And, over 90 percent of the soybean exports of the whole 
country came from Heilongjiang. 
  Experts here attributed the fast growth in farm exports of 
the province to growing border trade with Russia in recent years. 
  Along the 3,000-km borderline, 70 percent of the townships 
and 30 percent of the villages have built their processing 
industries, while inland cities have set up many export farm 
bases in the province. 
  To boost the development of an export-oriented economy, the 
province has invested about 120 million yuan to build more than 
170 farm production bases itself over the past few years. 
  It has also set up economic ties with over 30 countries and 
regions throughout the world, using foreign funds to build 
modern farms and processing industries.

  [Text] The Second Session of the Eighth Jilin Provincial 
People's Congress held its second plenary meeting on the 
afternoon of 22 February to hear a report on implementation of 
Jilin's 1993 national economic and social development plan and 
its 1994 draft plan given by Liu Jisheng, director of the 
provincial planning and economic commission; and a report on 
implementation of Jilin's 1993 budget and its 1994 draft budget 
given by Li Naijie, director of the provincial finance 
department. 
  Chen Zhenkang, executive chairman of the session, presided 
over the meeting. Other executive chairmen were Zhang Dejiang, 
Shang Zhenling, Yuan Baixiong, Zhou Zaikang, Zhang Mingyuan, Li 
Shixue, and Sun Youmin. 
  In his report, Liu Jisheng reviewed how Jilin's 1993 
national 
economic and social development plan was implemented, saying: 
In 1993, Jilin's agricultural output value totaled 22.3 billion 
yuan, up 5.5 percent from the preceding year; grain output 19.01 
billion kg, second highest in our history; industrial output 
value 105.16 billion yuan, up 18.8 percent; fixed asset 
investment of the entire society 23.21 billion yuan, up 53.6 
percent; and the increased value of the tertiary industry 16.74 
billion yuan, up 17.3 percent from the preceding year and up 7.6 
percentage points from the national average. 
  Speaking on arrangements for Jilin's 1994 national economic 
and social development plan, Liu Jisheng said: With the focus 
on comprehensively fulfilling the targets and tasks of promoting 
the economy to a new height, we should accelerate the reform 
designed to establish the socialist market economy system, open 
wider to the outside world, strengthen and improve macroeconomic 
regulation and control, achieve a balance between total supply 
and total demand, make great efforts to restructure the economy, 
strengthen enterprise management, strive to improve economic 
efficiency, and maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy economic 
development. 
  Li Naijie gave a report on implementation of Jilin's 1993 
budget and its 1994 draft budget. He said: In 1993, Jilin's 
revenue totaled 7.98 billion yuan, equivalent to 130 percent of 
the province's budgetary revenue of the year and showing an 
increase of 40.1 percent over the preceding year. Thanks to 
rapid economic development, Jilin overfulfilled its revenue 
target, and its budgetary expenditure by and large ensured the 
funds needed in reform, opening up, economic construction, and 
improvement of living standard. 
  He pointed out: The guiding thoughts for the arrangements of 
Jilin's 1994 budget are to thoroughly implement the guidelines 
of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Party Central Committee 
and the Second Plenary Session of the Sixth Provincial Party 
Committee, to actively promote the financial reform focusing on 
the tax assignment system, to establish a standard financial 
operation mechanism, to bring distribution into better balance, 
to greatly cultivate and open up new financial resources, to 
improve economic efficiency, to make the revenue increase 
compatible with economic development, to restructure the 
expenditure, to properly increase the investment in agriculture, 
education, science, and technology, and the funds for public 
security, procuratorial, and judicial organs, to properly reduce 
the expenses on ordinary purposes, and to persist in keeping the 
expenses within the limits of income and a balance between the 
revenue and the expenditure to promote sustained and rapid 
economic development.

  [Text] Beijing, Feb 21 (AFP)--The authorities in the far 
northeastern Chinese province of Jilin have sentenced seven 
people to death in an ongoing crackdown on economic crime, the 
People's Court News said Monday. 
  Three of the seven were executed immediately, while three 
more had their sentences suspended for two years, the newspaper 
said. 
  Among those executed were two banking accountants, Shi 
Yuqing 
and Zheng Xiaojie, who embezzled 189,000 yuan (22,000 dollars) 
and 990,000 yuan (114,000) from their respective bank branches. 
  A further 23 people were given prison sentences ranging from 
three years to life for a variety of crimes, including 
embezzlement, bribery, fraud and graft. 
  In a separate report, the newspaper said eight people were 
sentenced to death -- suspended in six cases -- for 
masterminding a series of robberies at an oil field in 
northeastern Hebei province. 
  On three separate occasions, they entered the oil field and 
stole hundreds of barrels of oil which they then sold on the 
black market. During one robbery, a dropped cigarette sparked a 
serious fire that raged for 21 days, the newspaper said.

propaganda and ideological work, consider the adherence to the 
theory of building a socialism with Chinese characteristics as 
the fundamental principle, implement the party's basic line in 
all fields, and further strengthen and improve the provincial 
propaganda and ideological work under the new situation. 
  Attending the conference were leaders Yue Qifeng, Wang 
Huaiyuan, Zhang Guoguang, Shang Wen, Wang Conglu, Li Guozhong, 
Xu Wencai, Wen Shizhen, Yu Junbo, Liu Zhenhua, Xiao Zuofu, Gao 
Diancheng, and Zhang Rongming. 
  In his speech, Gu Jinchi said: The national propaganda and 
ideological work conference, held not long ago, was an important 
conference of overall significance at the critical moment of 
establishing the socialist market economic structure and 
carrying out the modernization drive. We must conscientiously 
study the documents of this conference, profoundly understand 
and master the basic guidelines of the conference, and 
comprehensively implement the guidelines in line with the 
reality of Liaoning. 
  Gu Jinchi pointed out: Propaganda and ideological front has 
always been an extremely important front. Without the guiding, 
encouraging, and guaranteeing role of propaganda and ideological 
work, it is hard to establish the socialist market economic 
structure. 
  He emphatically pointed out: Our province is now at the key 
period of reform and development. It is of specially important 
and regent significance to strengthen and improve propaganda and 
ideological work. New situations and tasks have set new and 
even higher demands on propaganda and ideological work. To 
fulfill these tasks, the whole party must pay attention to 
further carrying out the principle of taking a two-handed 
approach and being tough with both hands. 
  Gu Jinchi pointed out: Propaganda and ideological work must 
be oriented to the fundamental principle of the theory of 
building the socialism with Chinese characteristics and must be 
subjected and geared to the overall situation of the work of the 
whole party. In line with the overall arrangements and the 
strategic ideology for propaganda and ideological work during 
the new situation, set forth by the central authorities, we 
should exert efforts in the following six aspects: 
  First, we should persistently arm the whole party with the 
theory of building a socialism with Chinese characteristics, 
control the overall situation, and guide all the work on 
propaganda and ideological front. Second, by closely centering 
on economic construction, we should make great effort to give 
rise to a public opinion atmosphere of the whole party paying 
attention to economic construction and should concentrate the 
attention of all fields at higher and lower levels on the 
central task of economic construction. All departments on 
propaganda and ideological front should make full use of their 
respective advantages to carry forward their role in theoretical 
guidance, public opinion guidance, spiritual encouragement, 
cultural appeal, and external propaganda with a view to adding 
vigor to the province's economic development. Third, we should 
give prominence to reform, increase the dynamics of propaganda, 
and support reform in a clear-cut manner. Fourth, by closely 
seizing the key link of emancipating the mind, in line with the 
province's situation and the realities of respective localities, 
we should guide the people with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory 
on the essence of socialism and the theory of socialist market 
economy to truly make clear what is socialism, to foster a new 
concept suiting the socialist market economy, and to make 
innovations boldly and make progress positively. Fifth, we 
should energetically advocate the main melody, improve the 
quality of the people, and enhance the people's pioneering 
spirit to create a good social environment for reform, 
development, and stability. At present, we should particularly 
exert great efforts in straightening out cultural market and 
further perfecting the province's systems, rules, and 
regulations on management of cultural market so as to orient the 
management of cultural market to the orbit of 
institutionalization and regularization as early as possible. 
Sixth, we should always conduct propaganda and ideological work, 
with the people as the mainstay, and with the purpose of 
training new persons with lofty ideals, moral integrity, 
education, and a sense of discipline. Currently, centering on 
reform, construction, and social stability of the province, we 
should strengthen ideological and moral education with 
patriotism, collectivism, and socialism as the key contents and 
should guide the people, young people in particular, to foster 
correct ideals, belief, the outlooks on world, on life, and on 
value. Propaganda and ideological departments as well as the 
vast numbers of propaganda and ideological workers should fully 
understand their important duties, strive to arm their brains 
with the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, correctly make explorations and improvements 
for the methods of propaganda and ideological work under the new 
situation, and constantly improve the level of propaganda and 
ideological work in order to suit the demand of building two 
civilizations. 
  Attending the conference were responsible secretaries of 
party committees and directors of propaganda departments of 
railway bureaus of Shenyang and various other cities, Liaohe 
Petroleum Prospecting Bureau, Northeast China Oil Transmission 
Management Bureau, and Northeast Management Bureau of the civil 
aviation administration of China. Also attending were 
responsible comrades of various departments, commissions, 
offices, and bureaus directly under the provincial authorities 
as well as various units on propaganda and cultural fronts.

  [Text] Shenyang, February 21 (XINHUA) -- The 
non-state-owned economic sector is becoming the "most vigorous" 
sector in Liaoning Province, a heavy industrial production 
center in China, according to the provincial government. 
  An official from the provincial statistics bureau said that 
non-state-owned manufacturers -- collectively-owned firms, 
private companies and Sino-foreign joint ventures -- turned out 
166 billion yuan worth of goods in 1993, up 50 percent over the 
previous year. 
  As a result, these manufacturers now account for nearly 48 
percent of the province's total industrial output value, an 
increase of four percentage points, the official said. 
  In contrast, output value of state-owned manufacturers rose 
just 5.3 percent last year, he said. 
  Production growth of collectively-owned businesses in both 
urban and suburban areas is the most impressive, with output 
value topping 100 billion yuan for the first time in 1993, he 
said. 
  The figure represented an increase of 68 percent over 1992, 
he added. 
  Meanwhile, output value of foreign-funded companies shot up 
by 40 percent and that of private firms by 50 percent, he said. 
  Local economists agreed that non-state-owned companies are 
now playing an increasingly significant role in circulation. 
  They cited the change in market shares as an example. Retail 
sales of state-run companies rose 10.4 percent in 1993, while 
those of collectively-owned firms climbed by 15 percent, those 
of private businesses by 43 percent and those of foreign-funded 
enterprises by 70 percent. 
  As a result, non-state-owned companies accounted for 63 
percent of Liaoning's retail sales in 1993, up by four 
percentage points. 
  Moreover, non-state-run research institutes are mushrooming 
throughout Liaoning, the economists said. 
  The province had 5,180 such institutes in 1993, 4,100 more 
than in 1992, according to the provincial statistics bureau. 
These institutes employed 70,000 people last year, 55,000 more 
than in 1992. 
  Moreover, these institutes generated a total of 170 million 
yuan in profits and taxes in 1993, ten times the amount in the 
previous year. 
  According to economists, the non-state-owned sector is also 
becoming a major source of revenue for Liaoning Province. 
  For example, collectively-owned township-run enterprises 
paid 
five billion yuan in taxes to the government last year, a 
quarter of Liaoning's revenue.

  [Text] Shenyang, February 21 (XINHUA) -- Sulphur dioxide in 
the air of Shenyang, capital of northeast China's Liaoning 
Province, will be reduced to two-thirds the current content in 
1996. 
  This is the predicted outcome of a facilities upgrading 
project in the Shenyang Smeltery, which emits up to 40 percent 
of the city's sulphur dioxide. 
  The project, scheduled to be completed in 1996, will slash 
sulphur dioxide emissions from the smeltery by 80 percent. 
Density of emissions will be far below limits set by the state. 
  The project recently received a loan of 5.89 million U.S. 
dollars from the Canadian Government through the Shenyang branch 
of the Bank of Communications. 
  The pollutant is mainly discharged by the smeltery's 
out-of-date purifying equipment, used in the preparation of 
sulphuric acid. 
  In 1994, this industrial city is reportedly to improve 70 
percent of its combustion and dust removing installments to meet 
state requirements.

  [Text] According to a high-ranking government official, 
the talks on Taiwan-Hong Kong air rights have entered a stage 
where a showdown is likely. The Communist Chinese insist on 
defining the Taiwan-Hong Kong air route as a direct, 
cross-strait route after 1997. Using this as a premise, they 
have expressed a willingness to grant new Taiwan-Hong Kong air 
rights that will remain in force after 1997, with Mandarin 
Airlines, Eva Airways Corporation, and Hong Kong's Cathay 
Pacific Airways jointly operating the route. However, we 
continue to define this air route as an international one. 
  According to the official, Communist China recently informed 
us through certain channels that it had no objection to the 
contents of an agreement proposed by Taiwan regarding new 
Taiwan-Hong Kong air rights. It signaled its willingness to 
allow the new aviation agreement to remain valid beyond Hong 
Kong's great threshold of 1997, by extending the term of the new 
aviation agreement until the year 2000. Additionally, Communist 
China did not take issue with Eva Airways Corporation's role in 
operating the Taiwan-Hong Kong air route, in order to satisfy 
our demand for "designating several airlines" to operate the 
route. 
  A precondition for Communist China's acceptance of the 
aforementioned terms, however, is that we must view the 
Taiwan-Hong Kong route as a direct route across the Taiwan 
Strait, or a "domestic route" within China's boundaries, after 
1997; that Taiwan may not use aircraft bearing the characters 
"Republic of China" [ROC] or painted with the ROC's emblem or 
flag on the Taiwan-Hong Kong air route; and that Taiwan may not 
take advantage of the air route to implement the policy of "two 
China's." In other words, China Airlines may not join in the 
operation of the Taiwan-Hong Kong air route. 
  Currently, we have a substantial difference of opinion with 
Communist China regarding the definition of the Taiwan-Hong Kong 
air route after 1997. The official noted: Our position is that 
although Communist China will retake Hong Kong after 1997, we 
will define and juristically proclaim Hong Kong and Macao as 
special regions different from Mainland China, and that 
continuing flights to those regions by Taiwan's aircraft after 
1997 will not be taken as direct flights across the Taiwan 
Strait. 
  The policy-making official stated: Although we will not 
challenge Communist China's definition of the Taiwan-Hong Kong 
air route as a domestic one, we will continue to view it as an 
international route. This will allow the two sides to define 
the route differently. With regard to China Airlines' 
withdrawal from the Taiwan-Hong Kong air route, the official 
said: The flexible practice of replacing China Airlines with 
Mandarin Airlines is not without precedent; this is our current 
mode of air services with Vietnam and Europe. There should be 
no serious problem provided China Airlines agrees to the 
arrangement. 
  The official stated: Some people recently proposed that 
Taiwan, Communist China, and a foreign country jointly finance 
and establish a new international airline company, which will 
allow Taiwan, Communist China, and Hong Kong to make use of this 
joint venture's ambiguous status to diminish the sensitivity of 
trilateral politics. After 1997, the company will be allowed to 
operate the Taiwan-Hong Kong air route exclusively.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 21 (CNA) -- The establishment of a 
Taiwan industrial park in Subic Bay marks a new era of economic 
cooperation between the Republic of China and the Philippines, 
Economics Minister P.K. Chiang said Sunday [20 February]. 
  Chiang made the remarks upon returning from Subic where he 
and Philippine Trade Secretary Rizalino Navarro jointly presided 
over a groundbreaking ceremony for the Taiwan-invested 
industrial park. 
  During the ceremony, Richard Gordon, chairman of the Subic 
Bay metropolitan authority, and M.H. Huang, chairman of Taiwan's 
United Development Corp. signed an agreement for joint 
development of the industrial park. 
  A number of high-ranking Philippine officials and a 
140-member Taiwan business delegation also attended the ceremony. 
  The Taiwan industrial park will be developed over a 325 
hectare area in three stages using a US$23.5 million soft loan 
from Taiwan. 
  The park is only one kilometer from a port and 10 minutes 
from an international airport. Because of its easy 
transportation access, Chiang has suggested that Subic Bay be 
developed into Taiwan's fourth export processing zone. 
  Subic Bay is an ideal choice for Taiwan investors, he added. 
It boasts almost-free rent, a free-market economic system and 
abundant, low priced, English-speaking labor. 
  The Philippine Government turned the former US Navy base at 
Subic, 80 km northwest of Manila, into a free port and 
industrial zone after US forces left in 1992. 
  Since then, a great number of Taiwan companies have shown 
interest in investing in the area and 51 more this time said 
they would jump on the bandwagon. 
  Taiwan investment is expected to pour US$1 billion into the 
industrial park and create 100,000 jobs, delivering a boost to 
the slumbering Philippine economy, the Manila-based Taipei 
Economic and Cultural Office said.

  [Text] Ottawa, Feb. 17 (CNA) -- Two-way trade between 
Canada and Taiwan registered a small increase last year, with 
Canada still suffering a big deficit, statistics Canada 
officials said Thursday. 
  Canada imported C$2.6 billion [Canadian dollars] (U.S.$1.93 
billion) in commodities from Taiwan in 1993, compared with C$2.5 
billion (U.S.$1.86 billion) the previous year, the officials

  [Text] Madrid, Feb. 19 (CNA) -- Trade between Taiwan and 
Spain dropped sharply to U.S.$884 million in 1993 from the 
record high of U.S.$1 billion in 1992. 
  Taiwan exports to Spain totaled U.S.$553 million in 1993, 
down 32.1 percent from the previous year, while imports from 
Spain registered U.S.$291 million, up 52.9 percent, Spanish 
customs tallies revealed. 
  The increase in Spanish imports and drop in Taiwan exports 
help cut Spain's trade deficit with Taiwan. Spain's trade 
deficit was U.S.$262 million in 1993, down 138 percent from 
U.S.$624 million in 1992.

  [Text] Geneva, Feb 23 (AFP) -- China has angrily rejected 
criticism of its human rights record issued by two international 
organizations, charging that they remain imprisoned in a "Cold 
War mentality." 
  Sources with the United Nations Commission on Human Rights 
said Tuesday that the Chinese delegate had denounced Amnesty 
International and Human Rights Watch the previous day. 
  "Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have not 
changed their mentality since the Cold War," he declared. "How 
can they assess the human rights situation in China without 
prejudice?" 
  He accused them of ignoring the progress made in China since 
1949, notably its victory over famine. 
  Amnesty, in a report submitted last week to UN human rights 
officials, charged that "hundreds of people (in China), 
including political dissidents and members of ethnic and 
religious groups, have been arbitrarily detained for peaceful 
exercise of their fundamental human rights." 
  "Torture, which is prohibited by law, continues to be 
widespread, sometimes resulting in death. 
  "In the past two years the death penalty has been 
increasingly used for non-violent offenses," according to 
Amnesty, which said it had received reports on the execution of 
1,250 people from January to November 1993. 
  Human Rights Watch issued findings similar to those of 
Amnesty. 
  Western countries are currently holding private discussions 
on a draft resolution on the human rights situation in China, 
which will also make reference to Tibet.

  [Text] Beijing, February 23 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin said here today that development and peace remain 
the two major issues to be resolved by the world. 
  Jiang made the remarks when meeting with Lawrence 
Eagleburger, former U.S. secretary of state, here this morning 
in Zhongnanhai, headquarters of the Central Committee of the 
Chinese Communist Party and the State Council. 
  Eagleburger is here as a guest of the Chinese Foreign 
Ministry, leading a U.S. "China investment and trade" delegation. 
  During the meeting, Jiang said that the current 
international 
situation is still changing in a complicated and profound way. 
The world is developing in the direction of multi-polarization, 
and the regionalization and conglomeration of the world economy 
are tending to accelerate. 
  However, the president said that various contradictions and 
conflicts concealed by the Cold War are gradually being 
uncovered, leading to disturbances, clashes and even the 
spilling of blood in some areas. 
  Jiang said that China has always attached much importance to 
developing relations with the United States. 
  More mutual trust and cooperation between China and the 
United States will make the two countries play a more active 
role in handling international affairs. 
  Sino-U.S. relations have seen positive development since the 
Seattle meeting between the presidents of the two countries last 
November, Jiang said, and since then, exchanges of visits at 
high-ranking level had been frequent and bilateral trade and 
economic cooperation strengthened. 
  "All these are helpful to promoting mutual understanding and 
solving disputes," he added. 
  As long as both sides have their eyes on the over-all 
situation and the next century, observe the principles of the 
three joint communiques between the two governments, respect the 
facts, increase consultations, and seek common ground while 
reserving differences, Sino-U.S. relations will be able to 
maintain a constant development on a normal track. 
  Eagleburger agreed with Jiang, saying that the changes that 
have taken place in China are very impressive, and all those who 
are concerned about stability in the next century should agree 
on the importance of proper u.s.-China relations, because a 
sound Sino-U.S. relationship is beneficial not only to the two 
countries, but to world stability and peace as well. 
  Eagleburger and his party arrived in Beijing on Monday [21 
February] evening. In addition to Beijing, they are scheduled 
to visit Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen.

<F P=106> [By political editor Mary Binks] </F>
  [Text] Britain's door to negotiation with China on 
arrangements for Hong Kong's final elections under British rule 
officially closed yesterday with the acknowledgement that co- 
operation was no longer possible. Until now, Britain and the 
Hong Kong administration had adamantly declared the door 
remained open to negotiation with China and that the British 
side was ready to fly to Beijing at short notice to resume 
talks. But yesterday, Chief Secretary Anson Chan conceded the 
time for negotiation on constitutional reform was over because 
of time constraints governing arrangements for the final 
elections under British rule. 
  Mrs Chan also, for the first time, conceded the possibility 
that China might dismantle Hong Kong's political system in 1997. 
  Mrs Chan cast doubts over her own political future saying 
she 
would find it difficult to preside over electoral arrangements 
which she did not consider fair and open if China dismantled 
Hong Kong's three tiers of government in 1997. "We've tried to 
give as much time as possible to reach agreement with the 
Chinese, that is the reason we decided to push ahead with the 
first stage first," Mrs Chan told The Hongkong Standard. 
  "The first stage dealt with very simple issues which we did 
not think the Chinese should have too much diffi culty with and 
the whole purpose of that was to buy ourselves more time so we 
could continue talks with the Chinese on more complex issues. 
"At the moment there is a considerable gap between the Chinese 
view and the British Hong Kong view. It is unfortunate that 
there has been no agreement but now we have no choice but to 
push ahead." 
  The Executive Council will on Tuesday endorse Governor Chris 
Patten's decision to push ahead with the remainder of his 
constitutional reform package, to be gazetted as early as next 
Friday and tabled on 9 March. 
  While Mr Patten has called China's bluff over its threats to 
disband the three tiers of government in 1997, Mrs Chan is more 
pragmatic. She warned Beijing that continuity in Hong Kong was 
crucial to the transfer of sovereignty, both politically and 
economically. "I would hope that if we had in place 
arrangements that would ensure fair, open elections that in the 
interests of preserving Hong Kong's prosperity and stability 
they would not be dismantled after the 1st July 1997." 
  Mrs Chan said she would personally find it difficult to 
remain in a government which presided over "unfair" electoral 
arrangements. However she stated, she was not expecting that to 
occur. 
  Mrs Chan hoped she would not be regarded by the Chinese 
leadership as a subversive for supporting political reform which 
although enshrined in the Joint Declaration was implemented 
without Beijing's consent. "I find it very difficult to read 
the thoughts of the Chinese," she said. "I hope they will 
regard every single member of the civil service as doing what 
they regard as in the best interests of Hong Kong." 
  She intended to serve in government until her retirement at 
60 in the year 2,000. "According to the Joint Declaration, 
provided that we uphold the Basic Law and swear allegiance to 
the future Special Administrative Region (SAR) government, I 
can't see any reason why serving civil servants could not 
continue after 1997. We don't want to see a wholesale 
replacement of senior officials on 1 July 1997." 
  Mrs Chan however did not discount being a candidate for the 
position of Chief Executive of the post-1997 SAR.

<F P=106> [By reporter Liang Guihe (2733 6311 0735)] </F>
  [Text] Paris, 16 Feb (XINHUA) -- During an interview with 
a Xinhua News Agency reporter today, French Senate President 
Rene Monory pointed out: As permanent members of the UN 
Security Council, France and China should continue to coordinate 
their actions in political affairs. The two countries are 
highly supplementary to each other in economic activities, 
science and technology, and culture. They should keep 
developing in-depth, equal, mutually beneficial, and friendly 
cooperation. 
  Senate President Monory is scheduled to arrive in China on 
22 
February for a formal, friendly visit at the invitation of Qiao 
Shi, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's 
Congress. He will be the first French Senate president to visit 
China since the two countries established diplomatic ties 30 
years ago. Monory told the reporter that, during his visit, he 
will meet with Chinese leaders for discussions on ways to 
improve and strengthen political, economic, cultural, and 
scientific and technological cooperation between the two 
countries. 
  Monory expressed admiration of the success China has 
achieved 
in economic construction. He said: China is a big country with 
a population of more than 1 billion. The economy enjoys very 
rapid development at an annual growth rate of more than 10 
percent. He continued: "It is a major event to which people 
cannot but attach importance." "Everyone in Europe and 
particularly in France is talking about China now." 
  Touching on relations between the two countries, Monory 
said: 
In the past few months, the French Government issued several 
statements, "unequivocally" guaranteeing that France will no 
longer sell arms to Taiwan. "It clearly indicates that the 
French Government is willing to develop friendly economic and 
political relations with China." He continued: "I completely 
agree with the Government's stand" on the issue. He said that 
the main purpose of his visit to China is to further improve and 
promote friendly Sino-French cooperation. He stressed that, as 
a major country in Western Europe, France should play an active 
role in promoting the development of political and economic 
relations between China and Western Europe. 
  Monory held: The potential for France and China to expand 
cooperation is tremendous. The two countries are highly 
supplementary to each other in economic cooperation and trade. 
China's rapid economic development is in the interests of 
Europe. He maintained: The development of economic and 
technical cooperation between the two countries should not be 
limited to only large enterprises and large construction 
projects. They should bring into full play the role of medium 
and small-sized enterprises and strengthen exchanges between 
provinces and municipalities. France may take advantage of its 
scientific and technological superiority to participate in 
China's economic development. 
  In his capacity as minister of national education, Monory 
visited China in 1988. Looking back on the visit, he said that, 
during his meeting with Li Peng and other Chinese leaders then, 
they focused discussions on developing cooperation between the 
two countries in culture, education, and personnel training. He 
said long-term friendship should be established between France 
and China, and bilateral cooperation should be expanded to all 
fields of endeavor.

<F P=106> [By special correspondent Chang Chun (4545 0689) from </F>
Shanghai: "At Deng Xiaoping's Suggestion, Zhang Zhen and Wang 
Ruilin Take Charge of Major Reshuffle of Generals"] 
  [Text] The Central Military Commission held an enlarged 
meeting of the military commission in mid-December last year to 
carry out a major reorganization among generals at the level of 
military region. Reorganization among army-level generals is 
still going on now. 
  Involving seven military regions, the Navy, the Air Force, 
and academies under the Central Military Commission, the current 
reorganization covers the widest scope and the largest number of 
high-ranking military officers in the past decade. 
  The theoretical basis for the current major changes is to 
make the ranks of military cadres younger in average age and 
more professional competent. 
  Zhang Zhen, vice chairman of the Central Military 
Commission, 
and Wang Ruilin (director of Deng Xiaoping Office), first deputy 
director of the General Political Department, have taken charge 
of the operation at Deng Xiaoping's suggestion. 
  As envisaged by the current military leaders, with all 
leaders of the Central Military Commission having been or soon 
to be overage, the leading bodies of the new military commission 
and three general departments will be composed of principal 
officers of the Navy, the Air Force, and the military regions in 
1996, with generals newly promoted to the deputy posts in 
military regions and principal officers of group armies serving 
as principal officers of the military regions and armed 
services. Moreover, a number of younger division-level military 
officers will be selected in preparation for the gradual 
takeover. 
  This is precisely the "echelon takeover" arrangement which 
Deng Xiaoping earlier assigned to Zhang Zhen, who is responsible 
for personnel matters in the military, and it is being 
officially implemented.

Commission for Restructuring Economic System: "Speed up 
Fostering and Developing the Market System"] 
  [Text] The section "Fostering and Developing the Market 
System" in the "Decision by the CPC Central Committee Concerning 
Certain Issues on Building the Socialist Market Economic System" 
clarifies six interrelated issues. To study conscientiously and 
understand profoundly these important expositions in the 
"Decision" is of important guiding significance to promoting the 
growth of China's market system and speeding up the building of 
the new socialist market economic system. 
<H3>  The Market System -- The Core of the Socialist Market 
Economic System </H3>
  To foster and develop the market system is the essential 
requirement for building the socialist market economic system. 
The essence of the new system is to enable the market to play a 
basic role in allocating resources under state macroeconomic 
regulation and control. An improved market system is the 
operational carrier and operational basis for the market to play 
a basic role in allocating resources. The extent of the growth 
of the market system shows the extent of the role played by the 
market in allocating resources, and also marks the maturity of 
the market economic system. In this sense, the market system 
and its operational mechanism is the core of the socialist 
market economic system. 
  To foster and develop market economy is an important pillar 
in constructing the basic framework of the new system. The 
"Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee depicts the basic framework of the socialist market 
economic system, including: A modern enterprise system, a 
developed market system, an improved macroeconomic regulation 
and control system, a rational personal income and distribution 
system, and a multilevel social insurance system. These five 
major pillars, interrelated and interconstrained, together 
constitute the basic framework of the new system, maintain in 
common the normal operation of the new system, and realize 
jointly the basic role of the market in allocating resources 
under macroeconomic regulation and control. To build up a 
modern enterprise system, and enable enterprises to truly manage 
to "look for the market and not the mayor," it is necessary to 
take building a developed market system as the prerequisite. 
The macroeconomic regulation and control system is mainly 
applying economic levers and economic policies to guide 
enterprises by market regulation and control, and one cannot 
depart from an improved market system to exercise indirect 
management of enterprises. 
  The goal of fostering and developing the socialist market 
economic system is to realize the change in the circulation of 
commodities and productive factors from planned distribution 
relations to market exchange relations; to build up a unified, 
open, competitive, orderly, complete, and developed big market; 
and to ensure that the market mechanism plays a basic role in 
allocating resources. Here, the first thing I want to talk 
about is the essence of the new market system; the second is its 
content and characteristics; and the third is its purpose. 
These three together constitute the goal of the new market 
system. 
  At a superficial level, the market refers to sites of 
transactions, and essentially speaking it is the sum total of 
the exchange relations between commodities and money. 
Therefore, to foster and develop the market system is not 
simply to build so many market places, more importantly it is to 
build new-type market exchange relations, and to change the 
administrative distribution relations of commodities and factors 
under the planned economic system into market exchange relations 
built on the basis of equal opportunity, independent 
transactions, fair competition, and equal exchange. 
  A modern market system that meets the requirements of a 
socialist market economy must have at least six characteristics: 
First, it must be unified, and not divided. It breaks regional 
blockades, departmental monopolies, and barriers between 
departments and regions. It encourages free circulation of 
commodities and factors, and removes artificial restrictions, 
thus creating a nationwide unified market. Second, it must be 
open and not closed. It is open at home, open to other cities 
(counties) and provinces; and it is also open to foreign 
countries, and achieves links between domestic and foreign 
markets. Third, it must be competitive and not monopolistic. 
It should have full and fair competition, and oppose monopoly, 
especially administrative monopoly. Both commodity prices and 
factor prices should be formed through market competition. 
Fourth, it must be orderly and not chaotic. The market 
principals are correct in their behavior, and their transaction 
activities standardized and legalized. They carry out open 
transactions under fair competition, with laws to abide by and 
rules to follow, and a fine market order is built up. Fifth, it 
must be complete and not fragmentary. It should have both a 
consumer goods market and a means of production market, and it 
should have a commodity market and a productive factors market; 
it should have a spot market as well as a futures market; it 
should create a visible market and attach importance to the 
invisible market; it should have low-level markets and 
high-level markets; it should have regional markets and a 
nationwide market; it should develop domestic as well as foreign 
markets. Sixth, it must be developed and not backward. On the 
one hand, it should have a developed hardware system, including 
market facilities, communications, telecommunications, banking, 
godowns and storage, processing, and facilities for keeping food 
fresh; on the other hand, it should have a developed software 
system, including management, information, and rules and 
regulations. Market operations are highly efficient, and 
business costs are low. 
  We are not fostering the market for the sake of fostering 
the market. The fundamental purpose of fostering the market is 
to create necessary conditions for the market to play a basic 
role in allocating resources. As for the flow of commodities 
and factors, only when the change from administrative 
distribution relations to market exchange relations is 
completed, and an improved and developed big market is built up 
can a socialist market economy be operated normally and its role 
be effectively brought into play. 
<H5>  Pricing Reform -- The Key to Developing the Market System </H5>
  The core of market economy is the market, and the core of 
the 
market is prices. The basic role played by the market in 
allocating resources is realized with the aid of the formation 
mechanism and operational mechanism of market prices. Price 
reform and market growth constrain and promote each other. 
Freeing prices and changes in the price formation mechanism are 
basic prerequisites for developing the market, because where 
prices are set administratively, there can be no competition; 
without competition, you cannot begin to talk about developing a 
true market. Practice since reform has also proved that the 
commodities for which prices are freed earlier are the 
commodities for which the market develops faster; conversely, 
the commodities for which prices are kept under tight control 
are the commodities for which the market is not developed. 
  Before reform, China implemented a highly centralized system 
of administrative setting of prices, which brought about a 
distorted pricing structure over a long period of time, thus 
playing a reverse regulatory role in allocating resources. 
After 15 years of reform, price reform has made substantial 
progress, fundamental changes have taken place in the 
overcentralized planned price structure, and prices of the great 
majority of commodities and labor have been released. It can be 
said that in the sphere of commodities and labor, the mechanism 
under which prices are formed by the market occupies a leading 
position. However, the task of price reform is not yet 
finished; some prices suitable for freeing have not been freed; 
there is still a two-tier price system for certain basic 
products; prices within the plan are still somewhat low; the 
reform of the price regulation and control system is relatively 
delayed; in particular, the market does not yet play a dominant 
role in the formation of interest rates, exchange rates, wages, 
and land costs, and prices of productive factors do not yet 
truly reflect their degree of scarcity. 
  For a period of time to come, price reform will mainly 
include three interrelated tasks: 
  --To build up a price mechanism that takes prices 
formed by the market as the dominant factor. This is the 
core of price reform, and is also the basis on which the price 
structure can constantly tend to be and continue being 
relatively rational. It is necessary to continue expanding the 
range in which prices are regulated by the market, strive to 
create conditions before too long to basically free prices in 
the sphere of commodities and labor suitable for freeing, and 
abolish as soon as possible the two-tier price system for the 
means of production; and moreover stress pushing forward the 
reform of prices of productive factors, gradually strengthen the 
role of market regulation in the formation of interest rates, 
exchange rates, land costs, enterprise wages, and the cost of 
other factors, and finally realize the mechanism of factor 
prices formed by the market under government macroeconomic 
regulation and control. 
  --The purpose of pricing reform is to build up a 
pricing structure that can constantly tend to be and continue 
being relatively rational, so as to guide continuously the 
rational allocation of resources. For some time to come, 
it is necessary to basically solve the problem of price 
structure distortion in commodities and labor by combining 
regulation with freeing. Lay emphasis on pushing forward reform 
in three aspects: First, reform of the prices of agricultural 
products, with rationalizing the purchase and marketing prices 
of grain as the center. Release the purchase and marketing 
prices of grain, and correspondingly build up and improve a 
multilevel grain reserve system from the central authorities to 
localities, a grain risk regulatory fund system, and a system of 
a minimum purchase price for the protection of producers and, 
when necessary, a maximum selling price. For prices of cotton, 
flue-cured tobacco, silkworm cocoons, and other agricultural 
products which are at present still under state control, it is 
also necessary to judge the hour and size up the situation, and 
actively push forward reform. Second, the reform of prices of 
the means of production and of communications and transportation 
with solving the problem of somewhat low energy prices as the 
dragon-head. It is necessary to continue solving the problem of 
somewhat low prices of coal, oil, and other basic industries 
under state monopolistic distribution and the problem of 
enterprise losses of a policy nature by increasing prices or 
enlarging the proportion of price release year by year. Third, 
the reform of prices of consumer goods, with increasing the cost 
of publicly owned housing as the focal point. It is necessary to 
quicken the pace of housing merchandization, and increase year 
by year the rent for civilian housing owned by the government to 
a rational level, and various localities may decide separately 
on their own, and achieve this situation in different steps 
according to their own circumstances. For charges for publicly 
run medical services, publicly run vocational education, and 
higher educational undertakings, it is also necessary to make 
timely and rational readjustment. 
  --To build up an improved, complete, and effective 
price regulation and control system. This is an important 
guarantee for the normal operation of the market price formation 
mechanism and rationalizing of the pricing structure. It is 
necessary to build up and improve an effective overall price 
level monitoring, warning, and regulation and control system, 
continue to include control of the overall price level in the 
plans for the national economy, and realize this mainly by 
currency control and regulation of total supply and demand; 
build up and improve a government reserve system for important 
commodities, including grain, cotton, oil, and important raw and 
processed materials, as well as gold and foreign exchange, with 
which to regulate the market and curb prices; build up and 
improve a price regulation fund system, to be used as economic 
backing for supporting production, fostering the market, and 
putting into effect government price limits when necessary; and 
build up and improve the system of price rules and regulations, 
work out as soon as possible the "Prices Law" and complementary 
rules and regulations, and correspondingly improve the price 
supervision system. 
<H5>  The Commodity Market -- the Basis of the Market System </H5>
  The commodity market is the foundation of the whole market 
system edifice. In the 15 years since reform, there have been 
tremendous changes in the commodity market. For about 80 
percent of industrial and agricultural products there has been a 
change from planned appropriation and distribution to allocation 
through market circulation, the pattern of monopoly by 
state-owned commercial and materials departments has been 
broken, and a commodity market network of diversified economic 
sectors, multiple forms of operation, multiple circulation 
channels, and multiple levels has been initially built up, but 
compared with the goal put forward in the "Decision" made at the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, China 
still has quite a long way to go. It is necessary to continue 
carrying out in-depth reform of the circulation system, and 
developing the commodity market in seven aspects around market 
principals, market carriers [shi chang zai ti 1579 1034 6528 
7555], the market mechanism, market rules and regulations, 
market regulation and control, market supervision, and market 
links. 
  It is necessary to create qualified market circulation 
principals, and continue in-depth reform of circulation 
enterprises. It is necessary to carry out transformation of some 
of the state-owned circulation enterprises, such as those of 
commerce, grain, materials, foreign trade, tobacco, medicine, 
and aquatic products according to a modern enterprises system. 
Those enterprises with the conditions may develop in the 
directions of groups and conglomerate business corporations; 
others may withdraw from the state-owned and state-operated 
pattern, to be "shifted to other lines of production, leased, 
operated on a contract basis, or sold." It is necessary to carry 
out reform of supply and marketing cooperatives according to a 
collective and cooperative nature. Moreover, it is necessary to 
further develop circulation enterprises of diversified economic 
sectors and multiple forms of operation. 
  It is necessary to improve the organizational system of the 
commodity market. Improve the commodity market network with 
complete functions, in which large, small, and medium-sized 
organizations are combined, and in which various economic forms 
and methods of operation exist simultaneously, with primary 
markets as the foundation, regional wholesale markets as the 
backbone, and a nationwide standardized wholesale market as the 
dragon-head. What requires special attention is that when there 
is a certain degree of market building, we should all the more 
attach importance to raising quality, heightening service level, 
strengthening service functions, and increasing operational 
efficiency. As for the futures market, we should make clear 
that it is still in an experimental stage at present. It is 
necessary to uphold the principle of "starting according to 
standards, and everything undergoing experiment," control 
strictly, grasp seriously, guard against blind development, and 
promote the healthy development of futures transactions. 
  It should be especially pointed out that the government 
undertakes the important responsibility of fostering the 
commodity market. However, in the course of promoting the 
growth of the commodity market, various government departments 
should first of all have their eyes on ending departmental 
separation, regional blockades, trade monopolies and various 
other restrictions that hamper the formation of a unified 
market; make efforts to foster new market exchange relations 
that conform to the principles of a socialist market economy; 
and create an environment of equal competition for the market to 
play a regulatory role. They must not proceed from the narrow 
interests of their own departments and regions, blindly scramble 
for markets and compete for comparisons of scale, and pursue 
market "grade" one-sidedly according to the will of government 
officials or in disregard of need; or compel enterprises to 
enter the market or restrict them from entering by 
administrative means, and artificially restrict the flow of 
commodities into or out of localities. These methods, 
incompatible with the principles of the market economy, must be 
resolutely corrected. 
<H3>  The Productive Factors Market -- The Focal Point of 
Fostering the Market System </H3>
  The "Decision" points out clearly that the focal point of 
fostering the market system at present should be developing the 
productive factors market. This is a very important theme. If 
the commodity market is the basis of the market system, then the 
productive factors market is its core. To allocate resources by 
the market, in the final analysis, is to allocate productive 
factors to the links that yield good performance. Productive 
factors entering the market for circulation is the essential 
requirement and necessary condition for the market mechanism to 
play a basic role in resource allocation. When there is a 
certain degree of growth of the commodity market system, to 
speed up developing the productive factors market becomes a 
pressing requirement for developing a socialist market economy. 
In the whole process of the market allocation of resources, if 
there is ample competition in the commodity market and the 
commodity price signal changes with supply and demand, without a 
corresponding productive factors market, and with funds, labor, 
land, and other productive factors unable to flow in and out 
freely and flexibly between trades and enterprises, then it is 
difficult for the market to realize the function of resource 
allocation. Moreover, without an improved productive factors 
market, it would be impossible to create rational prices for 
productive factors. And if the prices of various productive 
factors are distorted and cannot truly reflect their degree of 
scarcity, you cannot begin to talk about rational utilization 
and optimum allocation of productive factors. At present, to 
develop the productive factors market, we should pay special 
attention to building the financial market, land market, and 
labor market, and further develop the markets of technology, 
information, and property rights. 
--To develop and improve the financial market with bank 
financing as the key link. In a market economy which is a 
money economy, funds are the most important resource. The 
financial market is the pivot of the whole market system. 
However, there is a very big gap between the building of the 
financial market and the requirements of a socialist market 
economy. The main problem lies in low degree of growth of the 
financial market, lack of effective supervision and control, and 
chaotic market order. The basic goal of developing and 
improving the financial market is to build up a unified and 
open, competitive and orderly financial market system under 
strict control. Specifically: In the money market, it is 
necessary to standardize the interbank borrowing market, so as 
to make it truly become a money market, and so various types of 
financial organizations can accommodate funds and make up one 
another's money deficiencies from their own surpluses in the 
overnight borrowing market, but there must be a strict time 
limit. It is necessary to promote the development of the note 
market, make great efforts to develop the note discount 
business, and allow banks to discount each other's notes and 
make up others' funds deficiencies from their own surpluses. 
The key to developing the financial market is to push forward 
actively and safely the reform of the interest rate formation 
mechanism. The People's Bank works out a standard interest rate 
for deposits and loans, and the upper and lower intervention 
limits that allow fluctuation; and various interest rates should 
reflect differences in time limit, cost, and risk, and maintain 
a rational profit difference. Gradually build up a market 
interest rate system with the interest rate of the central bank 
as the basis to enable interest rates to change flexibly and 
truly reflect the supply and demand situation in the funds 
market. In the capital market, it is necessary to develop 
actively and safely the bond market and the stock market. It is 
necessary to improve the national debt market, and legislate to 
prevent the financial sector from borrowing from the central 
bank, and financial deficits should be covered by issuing 
national bonds. Banks of a policy nature may issue financial 
bonds. National commercial banks may accommodate funds from the 
central bank with national bonds and financial bonds as 
mortgages, and other financial organizations may also 
accommodate funds from each other with bonds as mortgages, thus 
creating conditions for the central bank to develop open market 
business. It is necessary to improve the stock market, 
standardize the issue and listing of stocks, and gradually 
expand its scale; and improve the stock exchange and the 
management of the exchange departments and affiliated 
organizations. 
  --Reform the labor system, and gradually build up the 
labor market. Labor is the only dynamic factor among the 
productive factors. The development of the market economy 
requires that such an important productive factor as labor 
should also be brought into the operational track of the market 
economy. The goal of the new labor market is to build up a new 
labor market pattern in which, under state macroeconomic 
regulation and control, labor can flow freely, wages are mainly 
decided by labor productivity and the supply and demand of the 
labor market, and the market mechanism plays a basic role in 
labor resources allocation. Specifically: First, it is 
necessary to speed up the reform of the labor and personnel 
system, the graduate assignment system, and the personnel system 
of government organizations and public undertakings. Gradually 
abolish the management system of planned assignment of labor, 
the state no longer being the principal employer of labor, 
implement the decisionmaking power of enterprises in the use of 
labor, and build up a competitive employment mechanism in which 
staff and workers can enter and leave enterprises freely, a 
two-way selection by staff and workers and by organizations that 
use labor is carried out, and there is a rational flow of labor. 
Implement the public servant system in government 
organizations; and universally popularize the recruitment system 
in public undertakings. Gradually change the system of overall 
assignment of university graduates by the state, and implement a 
new assignment system of two-way selection by organizations that 
use labor and by university graduates. Moreover, speed up the 
reform of the wage system and realize remuneration for labor by 
money and wages being mainly decided by labor productivity and 
the supply and demand of the labor market. The state regulates 
primarily by legislating for minimum wages and by tax 
collection. Moreover, it is also necessary to reform the 
household register management system. These reforms are 
prerequisites for developing the labor market. Second, build up 
and improve a multilevel and multiform labor market. China's 
labor force is multilevel, and its labor market should also be 
multilevel and multiform. There should be a nationwide as well 
as regional, an urban as well as a rural labor market; there 
should be general employment service centers, as well as a 
market for senior scientists and technicians. It is also 
necessary to build up a labor export market. Third, develop an 
employment service system. It is necessary to make vigorous 
efforts to develop intermediary organizations and service 
entities that serve the flow and allocation of labor; strengthen 
the employment services system, such as occupational 
recommendation, employment training, and labor arbitration; and 
build up a nationwide and unified labor supply and demand 
information network. Fourth, speed up the reform of the housing 
system, and build up and improve a social insurance system. This 
is an important guarantee of whether or not the labor market can 
develop and operate normally. If housing of staff and workers 
is still assigned by work units and not obtained through the 
market, and if medical care, pensions, and social insurance rely 
mainly on work units with a very low degree of socialization, 
then the flow of labor will meet with enormous obstacles, and it 
will be difficult for the labor market to develop. Fifth, it is 
necessary to build up and improve various labor rules and 
regulations, gradually standardize the labor market, increase 
the degree of civilization of the market, and protect the 
legitimate rights and interests of laborers and the 
organizations that use them. 
--Standardize and develop the real estate market. Land is 
a scarce and nonrenewable resource. With little arable land and 
a large population, China must treasure land resources highly 
and use them rationally. The core of reform of the land system 
in cities and towns is to foster and develop the land market and 
change the administrative appropriation system, under which land 
is free, is used indefinitely, and cannot flow, into a market 
allocation system under which land is paid for, is used for a 
limited duration, and can flow. In the city and town land 
market system, the Grade I land market is monopolized by the 
state, and the Grade II land market is released, but under 
regulation and control. The Grade I market, that is, the market 
for the sale of the right to use land, is under unified 
management by the state, and no one has the right to sell it. 
However, the method of sale by the state should be reformed, 
and the market mechanism introduced. According to the principle 
of separation of land ownership from the right to use land, 
under the premise that the state maintains land ownership, the 
right to use land is pushed into the market, thus widening the 
range of market allocation. All operational land is provided by 
the method of sale, and land ownership is sold by auction and 
public bidding to users at particular prices, for fixed numbers 
of years, and for fixed uses. In the Grade II land market, that 
is, the market where the right to use land is transferred, the 
land sold by the state can be re-transferred, rented, and 
mortgaged between users with prices regulated by the market and 
created through competition. However, the state should 
strengthen regulation and control and management. For instance, 
the nature of the use of land should be planned during land 
transfer, land registration formalities should be completed, the 
transferred amount declared, and value-added tax paid to guard 
against the loss of state land income in the transfers and 
transactions in the sale of the right to use land, and to crack 
down on illegal activities of land speculation, raising land 
costs by cheating, and seeking exorbitant profits. In rural 
areas, it is necessary to explore actively the reform of the 
land system. At present, it is necessary to appropriately 
lengthen the land contract period, stabilize land contract 
relations, encourage the peasants to increase input, and raise 
land productivity. Moreover, it is necessary to improve 
gradually the circulation mechanism of the right to use land 
and, under the premise of upholding collective land ownership 
without changing the use of land, the compensated transference 
of the right to use land is allowed with the consent of the 
contracting parties. It is necessary to protect cultivated land 
conscientiously, and strictly control the transfer of land for 
agricultural use to nonagricultural use. 
  In addition, it is necessary to further develop the 
technology market, introduce the competition mechanism, protect 
intellectual property rights, and put into practice the 
compensated transfer of technological results; further develop 
the information market, realize the merchandization and 
industrialization of information, and raise the extent of social 
enjoyment of information; further develop the property rights 
market; and promote the flow, reorganization, and optimum 
allocation of assets in stock. 
<H5>  Intermediary Organizations -- The Links of the Market System </H5>
  In market economy operations, as ties that link the 
government, the market, and enterprises, intermediary 
organizations play a role that cannot be replaced by government 
administrative management, and developed intermediary 
organizations are important expressions of a mature market 
system and a developed market economy. 
  Market intermediary organizations have four main functions: 
First, services, to provide market principals with information 
service, advisory service, distribution and delivery service, 
training service, brokerage service, and legal service. Second, 
communications, to link up the ties between various types of 
market principals, including between enterprises, between 
enterprises and the government, and between international 
activities. Third, notarization, to ensure fair market 
competition and impartial transactions; to develop financial 
accounting and auditing, assessment of assets and credibility, 
and quantity and quality inspection; and to arbitrate market 
disputes. Fourth, supervision, to work out pledges or trade 
rules for self-restraint according to market regulations, and 
supervise market transaction behavior. 
  Judged by the types of market intermediary organizations, 
the 
stress should be placed on developing the following types: 
First, self-disciplinary organizations for coordinating and 
constraining market principal behavior, such as various trade 
associations, trade councils, and chambers of commerce; second, 
notary organizations to ensure impartial transactions and fair 
competition, such as accountants' offices, lawyers' offices, 
auditors' offices, and assets and credibility assessment 
organizations; third, service organizations for promoting market 
growth and reducing transaction costs, such as information 
centers, advisory and research organizations, quotation systems, 
settlements centers, materials distribution and delivery 
centers, and warehouses; fourth, "bridge" organizations that 
render market direct services, such as various kinds of brokers, 
the pawn trade, the auction trade, occupation recommendation 
offices, human resources exchange centers, etc; and fifth, 
inspection and attestation organizations for supervising market 
activities and maintaining normal market order, such as quantity 
and quality control, production inspection, and other production 
service organizations. 
  Intermediary organizations should undergo qualification 
approval and be established according to law; a competition 
mechanism should be built up among market intermediary 
organizations, with the superior winning out and the inferior 
being eliminated; and intermediary organizations should 
undertake corresponding legal and economic responsibility for 
the consequences of their behavior, and accept management and 
supervision by the government departments concerned. 
<H3>  Legal and Supervisory and Management Systems--the Guarantee 
of Normal Operation of the Market System </H3>
  The core of the market legal system is to protect fair 
competition and enable market transactions to proceed in good 
order in an open, fair, and impartial competitive environment, 
thereby bringing into full play the basic functions of the 
market in allocating resources under legal protection and 
standardization. A complete market legal system should include 
at least the following aspects: Laws and regulations on market 
aspects, including laws and regulations that standardize 
different market aspects, such as a "company law," a "bank law," 
a "broker law," etc; laws and regulations on market 
organizations, such as regulations regarding open markets and 
wholesale markets, and stock exchanges and futures exchanges; 
laws and regulations on market entry, such as an "enterprise 
registration law" and certain special laws and regulations on 
market admission (such as on securities, futures, catering, and 
special trades); laws and regulations on market transactions, 
mainly a "law against illegitimate competition," a prices law, 
laws on commodity quality, etc; laws and regulations on 
protection of rights and interests to protect the legitimate 
rights and interests of producers, operators, and consumers, 
such as a "law on protection of the rights and interests of 
consumers," a "patent law," a "trademark law," and antidumping 
and antisubsidy laws and regulations regarding foreign economic 
relations; laws and regulations on market regulation and 
control, such as establishing laws and regulations on a reserve 
system, a market regulation funds system, and a state order 
system; and laws and regulations concerning market mediation, 
arbitration, and market supervision and management. 
  While paying special attention to improving the system of 
market laws and regulations, it is also necessary to build up an 
effective market supervisory and management system to ensure the 
implementation of various laws and regulations. A new market 
supervisory and management system should be one that operates in 
all directions, at different levels, and with a clear-cut 
division of labor. First, it is necessary to create and improve 
a self- supervisory and management system, including improvement 
in the management system within enterprises, strengthening 
occupational morality and legal system education, 
conscientiously observing discipline and abiding by the law, and 
self-disciplinary management within trades and places of various 
kinds of centralized transactions, such as open markets, 
commodity wholesale markets, stock exchanges, occupation 
exchanges, and technology exchange markets. It is also 
necessary to work out rules and regulations within organizations 
to standardize transaction behavior and constrain market 
principals to carry out operations according to law. Second, 
create and improve a social and public supervisory system. 
Bring into play the masses' supervisory functions of consumer 
associations and staff and worker price supervision 
organizations, and bring into play the public opinion 
supervisory functions of the mass media. Third, create and 
improve an administrative and judicial supervisory and 
management system. It is necessary to build up an authoritative 
market law enforcement and supervisory organization to carry out 
inspection and supervision of various types of market behavior, 
protect legitimate operations, ban illegal operations, maintain 
open, impartial and fair transactions, and protect the 
legitimate rights and interest of operators and consumers, so 
that laws shall be abided by and transgression of laws shall be 
punished. Criminal behavior that sabotages market order shall 
be dealt with by judicial departments according to law. 
Resolutely punish lawbreaking behavior of producing and selling 
forged and inferior commodities and despots that lord it over 
trades and market.

1837): "Chen Kaizhi Stresses No More "Funds Will Be Injected" 
into Stated-Owned Enterprises; Bankrupt State-Owned Enterprises 
Will Experience `Euthanasia'"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou 18 Feb (TA KUNG PAO)--Guangzhou Vice Mayor 
Chen Kaizhi acknowledged that "[Guangzhou authorities] have 
eventually come around to the issue of ownership of the 
enterprise's assets," and decided against injecting more funds 
to save those perishing state-owned enterprises on the brink of 
bankruptcy, but would urge them to close like the process of 
"euthanasia." "Matchmaking" would be conducted for those 
enterprises in puberty [qing chun qi 7230 2504 2601] so that 
they might be "married" as early as possible, with "the market, 
interests and privileges as well as equity" boldly conceded to 
foreign businessmen. 
  He indicated that Guangzhou would take major action in the 
transformation of enterprises in the share-holding system; a 
specialized trade center for property rights would be set up. 
Regarding those state-owned enterprises in poor condition, an 
asset evaluation would be conducted rationally by a state-owned 
asset management company; at the same time some enterprises 
would be founded to purchase those "perishing" enterprises, 
which would revive them through special packaging, 
transformation, repair and maintenance, then they will be sold 
at higher prices. In a nutshell, those "perishing" enterprises 
would no longer be salvaged through bank loans at discounted 
interest rates and assured power supplies to linger out a meager 
existence, but would implement a measure likened to "euthanasia." 
  In addition, he stated that Guangzhou would complete the 
transformation of enterprises to companies within two or three 
years, with the shaping of an operational pattern of multiple 
economic factors. An enterprise might form a board comprising 
many aspects with several bosses. Should the shares of these 
enterprises be transferred, they could be sold to state-owned 
enterprises which were rich, or be listed by the company, while 
allowing share-holders to buy the shares. In addition, foreign 
businessmen could buy those shares, too. 
  Today, Guangzhou boasts some 20,000 enterprises in various 
categories, of which some 4,000 are industrial enterprises. 
Take the large-type Zhujiang cement work for example. Earlier, 
it sold half of its equity to some foreign businessman, and 
managed to transfer its loans; consequently, the enterprise is 
developing "without any burden." 
  Through defining enterprise property rights and asset 
evaluation, said Chen Kaizhi, from now on dynamic control would 
be implemented regarding state-owned assets, so that state-owned 
enterprises might appreciate in management. He believed that 
the reform of property rights would be an impetus to bring along 
the further deepening of enterprise reform in China.

<F P=106> ["Chen Xitong, secretary of the Beijing Municipal CPC </F>
Committee, Continues His Investigations in Mountain Areas"] 
  [Text] On 21 January, Chen Xitong, secretary of the 
municipal party committee; and Yang Chaoshi and Duan Bingren, 
members of the Standing Committee of the municipal party 
committee, went deep to Shidu Town and Jiudu Village of Fangshan 
District to understand the local situation, called on veteran 
party members and several specialized households engaged in 
breeding industry, and also inspected the kiwi production bases 
in Xibaidai Village of Zhangfang Town. 
  On 25 January, Chen Xitong and his party went to Mengtougou 
District and met with the newly elected district party committee 
standing committee members. They also went to Sanggu Village of 
Junxiang Township, an old revolutionary area, to understand the 
situation and called on the veteran party members who had joined 
the early stage of revolution and some households with 
difficulties. 
  These two districts have shared the common characteristics 
as 
follows: Emancipate the mind; proceed from reality; base on the 
local natural resources; develop, on a large scale, economic 
forests and building materials; and quicken the pace of seeking 
wealth and stepping toward the target of becoming fairly 
well-off. 
  Song Xiyou, newly elected secretary of the Mengtougou 
District Party Committee, said: The newly elected members of 
the leading body are at an average age of 43.5 years. The 
youngest standing committee member is only 29 years old. Thus, 
the leading body is basically "installed in the shape of 
ladder." Except that only one person is graduated from the 
secondary specialized school, the rest have an educational level 
of university or higher. It can be said that the new leading 
body is full of vitality, is able to realize the target of 
becoming fairly well-off, and enjoys the support of the broad 
masses of party members and veteran cadres. We maintain that 
this is a strategic measure for strengthening the building of 
leading bodies. Song Xiyou also reported on the district's 
strategic idea for becoming fairly well-off in 1997 and the plan 
for relying on the natural resources of the mountain areas to 
build Shilong small industrial zone and five major bases engaged 
in the production of building materials, coal, and fruit 
products and the development of tourist trade. He said: 
Practice showed that it is accurate to persist in the new ideas 
of "relying on the mountain areas to making a living, going out 
of the mountain areas to build mountain areas, entering markets 
to seek wealth, and make the mountain areas wealthy by opening 
to the outside world and development; and it is right to persist 
in the work methods of conducting investigations and study on a 
large scale and proceeding from reality. Mengtougou, a district 
with mountains, changes itself from "having no ways to make 
development" into "having methods to make development" because 
it has persisted in the accurate development ideas and work 
methods. 
  Chen Xitong congratulated Mengtougou District on the 
successful convocation of the party congress, praised that 
representatives of party members and veteran cadres have 
strategic foresight to support the election of younger leading 
body members, and fully affirmed the district's strategic ideas 
of conducting investigations and study, proceeding from reality, 
and becoming fairly well-off ahead of schedule. He stressed: 
The new leading body's tasks are to work under the guidance of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, to conscientiously implement the 
guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Party 
Central Committee, to work in line with the work guiding 
principles of the municipal party committee and the municipal 
government and in reliance on the district's party members and 
people, to proceed from the reality of the mountain areas, and 
to make the work be submitted to and serve the target of 
quickening the pace of becoming wealthy and the target of 
becoming fairly well-off. 
  On the basis of the local natural resources, Fangshan 
District with rich natural resources has vigorously developed 
the fruit tree planting industry, the household-based breeding 
industry, and the tourist trade. So, the peasants in the 
district start to take on the path of seeking wealth. Last 
year, the total product of the district reached 7.9 billion 
yuan, an increase of 60 percent over 1992. This year, this 
district further eliminated the thinking of small-scale 
development; set forth, according to the local actual 
conditions, a plan for building a 10,000-mu kiwi production 
garden, a 10,000-mu apricot production garden, a 10,000-mu 
Chinese toon production garden, and a 10,000-mu chestnut 
production garden; and also started to implement the plan. So 
far, Xibaidai Village of Zhangfang Town has sown kiwis on 1,000 
mu of land and has a good marketing prospect. Jiudu Village has 
also gained benefits from developing the breeding industry. Of 
160 households, 130 households are engaged in the breeding of 
coypus. Last year, the village's revenues netted 800,000 yuan 
and the village's savings deposits increased by a big margin. 
  Chen Xitong fully affirmed Fangshan District's practice of 
emancipating the mind, using the local advantages to develop the 
economy, and guiding the peasants to step toward the target of 
becoming fairly well-off. He especially pointed out that in the 
past, the mountains and rivers in Shidu scenic spot were of no 
use; but now, the people there have emancipated the mind, opened 
the mountain areas to the outside world, and thought out 
methods. With these methods, the mountains and rivers have been 
changed into wealth. 
  When calling on veteran party members and households with 
difficulties, Chen Xitong urged again and again that districts 
and villages should give more concerns and support to them and 
have them experience the concerns of the party and the warmth of 
the socialist society. He especially praised Mengtougou 
District and the townships and villages of the district for 
giving monthly living subsidies to veteran party members and 
giving temporary and special subsidies to those with 
difficulties. He also told the cadres that the old 
revolutionary areas have many old party members, fighters, and 
comrades. They made sacrifice and contributions to the 
revolution. We must never forget them. So, we should do more 
good and concrete deeds for them and have them spend a good 
Spring Festival. In Jiudu Village of Fangshan District, Chen 
Xitong especially urged that the comrades in the district should 
help Veteran Party Member Liu Xianfu and help cure his eye 
diseases. It was informed that the No. 1 hospital of the 
district has diagnosed his illness and worked out a treatment 
program for him.

levels across the province have held aloft the banners of 
patriotism and socialism, united with all democratic parties and 
mass organizations, and the people of various nationalities and 
various circles, conscientiously studied Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, 
comprehensively implemented the party's basic line, 
realistically exercised the basic functions of political 
consultation and democratic supervision in line with the party's

establishing the modern enterprise system and invigorating the 
state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises; second, 
optimizing the economic structure and raising the level of 
industries; third, developing high-yield, fine-quality and 
highly-efficient farming and township enterprises, and 
unceasingly raising the income of peasants; fourth, 
strengthening the building of international economic and trade

standardized political consultation and democratic supervision, 
strengthened the work on nationalities, religions, cultural and 
historical materials, and overseas contacts, and strengthened 
ties with and guidance for CPPCC Committees in various cities 
and counties. The second part is to define the 1994 guiding 
ideology and major tasks of the provincial CPPCC work, which 
include the efforts to take the theory on building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics as the guidance, comprehensively 
and deeply implement the guidelines of the 14th party congress 
and of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee, submit ourselves to and serve the overall situation 
of the party's work focusing on seizing the opportunity,

and maintaining stability, act in close connection with the 1994 
work priorities of the provincial party committee, give play to 
the political and personnel advantages of the CPPCC, 
conscientiously exercise the functions of political consultation 
and democratic supervision, further open up a new situation in 
the CPPCC work, and make new contributions to our province's 
reform, opening up, economic development, and social stability.

<F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>
  [Text] After a comprehensive test and inspection, all the 
F-104 fighters which had been grounded due to their long service 
life joined once again the ranks of the Air Force's fighters 
safeguarding the territorial space over the Taiwan Strait. It 
is estimated that the F-104 fighters will continue their service 
for three to four more years to make up for the inadequacy of 
combat effectiveness during this period before the F-16 and 
Mirage-2000 fighters purchased from the United States and 
France, respectively, are delivered. The following is a report 
filed by Liu Yu-mei: 
  [Begin recording] [Liu Yu-mei] Separated by a distance of 
merely 70 plus miles from the mainland, the Air Base in Hsinchu 
occupies an important strategic position. While undertaking the 
all-weather air defense mission, fighters at the base are 
standing by for immediate takeoff within 3, 5, or 15 minutes 
after orders are received to intercept intruding enemy aircraft, 
because it will take three to four more years before the F-16 
fighters purchased from the United States and the Mirage-2000 
fighters purchased from France can be successively delivered. 
All the F-104 fighters had been grounded due to their long 
service life but, after their control system's hydraulic pipes 
and electronic circuits were completely replaced with new ones 
and after improvements were made in their fuselages, the Air 
Force has by now completed the inspection and repair of some of 
the fighers to let them undertake the necessary mission of being 
on the alert and intercepting any intruding enemy aircraft. The 
499th Wing of the Air Force recently conducted a Spring Festival 
combat readiness exercise at the Hsinchu Air Base. The F-104 
fighter squadron under the 2d Wing sent four F-104 fighters 
whose test and inspection had just been completed plus four 
(?F-5E/F) and four AT-3 trainers and fighters to conduct combat 
exercises. Lieutenant General Sun An-kuo, director of the Air 
Force's General Political Warfare Department, said that Air 
Force flyers deem it their highest honor to be able to sacrifice 
their holidays to undertake the air patrol mission. 
  [Sun An-kuo] All Air Force officers and men will make great 
efforts, such as undertaking the missions of being on the alert, 
on patrol, and so forth, to protect the safety of the treasured 
island [Taiwan] during the Spring Festival every year. We wish 
all the civilians of the country a very good time during the 
Chinese Lunar New Year holidays. Though we sacrifice our 
holidays, we feel it is our greatest honor. 
  [Liu] Due to the important strategic position occupied by 
the Hsinchu Air Base, most of the Mirage-2000 fighters will be 
deployed there after they are delivered in the future. At 
present, the Air Force already selected more than a dozen 
language and technical experts and sent them to France for 
training to become certified instructors. It is estimated that 
overall equipment replacement [of the fighters] will be 
completed by the end of the century. [end recording] 
  The above report was filed by Liu Yu-mei, reporter of the 
Broadcasting Corporation of China, at the Hsinchu Air Base.

  [Text] Moscow, February 23 (XINHUA) -- Moscow would expose 
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agents in Russia in 
retaliation for the U.S. judicial proceedings against a couple 
of Russian spies, the Russian independent NTV company reported 
on Wednesday [23 February]. 
  It quoted an unidentified "high-ranking Russian official" as 
saying that "given the wish, it is possible to spotlight 
American diplomats working for the CIA and Russians 
collaborating with the secret service." 
  The U.S. Government has instituted judicial proceedings 
against Aldrich Hazen Ames, the former chief of the CIA's Soviet 
Counter-Intelligence Branch, and his wife Maria, charging them 
with spying for the former Soviet Union and Russia. 
  Ames, 52, a CIA employee for more than 31 years, and his 
wife, Maria Del Rosario Casa Ames, 41, a Colombian-born 
naturalized U.S. citizen, were arrested on Monday by CIA and FBI 
agents. 
  According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the Ames couple 
have been spying against the U.S. since 1985 and received more 
than 1.5 million U.S. dollars in payoff money and deposited the 
money on accounts in U.S. and foreign banks. 
  The investigation of the case started 10 months ago. U.S. 
President Bill Clinton described it as "a very serious case" and 
ordered the State Department to lodge an official protest to the 
Russian Government. 
  Yuri Kobaladze, spokesman for the Russian Foreign 
Intelligence Service, said on Wednesday that the spy scandal 
over the Ames couple might has been revealed to discredit the 
success of the Russian foreign policy in resolving the Sarajevo 
crisis. 
  Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Grigoriy Karashin stated, 
meanwhile, that "much has to be cleared up." 
  In a statement delivered earlier Wednesday, Russian 
Presidential Spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov said, "a return to 
the psychology of the Cold War, mounting mistrust, and a new 
wave of spy mania would contradict the ideas of international 
partnership for peace."

  [Text] Sarajevo, February 23 (XINHUA) -- A commander of the 
Russian peacekeeping forces in Bosnia-Hercegovina said today 
that his forces would remain neutral while conducting 
peacekeeping operations and observing the ceasefire. 
  He told XINHUA reporters that the Russian troops will not be 
on the side of the Bosnian Serbs, but will treat all sides 
equally. 
  He said his forces have not yet begun their mission, and 
were 
now familiarizing themselves with the complicated situation and 
environment in the Serb-held areas. 
  The commander said that the peacekeeping forces, as well as 
the civilian population, require security guarantees. 
  He added that his battalion would stay as long as the UN 
peacekeeping force commander in Sarajevo and the Russian 
Government so desire. 
  Russia, a traditional ally of the Serbs, intervened in the 
Bosnian crisis on the eve of the NATO ultimatum deadline 
threatening air strikes against the Serbs. 
  Some 400 Russian troops stationed in Croatia arrived in 
Sarajevo Sunday evening to enforce and monitor the cease-fire. 
  The Russian troops, along with French forces, are deployed 
along the dividing line between Serbs and Muslims, and are led 
by French Brigadier General Andre Soubirou, the commander of UN 
forces in Sarajevo. 
  The commander said his forces will continue to carrying out 
their peacekeeping mission and monitor the cease-fire. 
  Since the cease-fire agreement signed two weeks ago the 
22-month-old war has subsided, as local people try to resume a 
normal life. 
  A Sarajevo resident told XINHUA reporters that he felt much 
safer now than ten days ago, and sees a gleam of hope for 
Sarajevo "after Russia's efforts to solve the Bosnian conflict".

  [Text] Warsaw, feburary 23 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev proposed today a "new 
partnership for the whole of Europe." 
  He said that the partnership should be based on cooperation 
within the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe 
(CSCE), adding that the CSCE should become an efficient 
political organization. 
  Under the partnership, Kozyrev said in the southern Polish 
city of Krakow, Russia and its western partners will ensure the 
security of central and Eastern European nations. 
  As to the application of the VISEGRAD group (Poland, the 
Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia) to join the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), he noted that this could 
result in new political demarcations if NATO accepts the four 
countries, adding that this action could isolate Russia.

  [Text] Moscow, February 23 (XINHUA) -- Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin confirmed today that he had proposed a one-day 
summit meeting with leaders of four big NATO nations to "put a 
full end" to the conflicts in former Yugoslavia. 
  Yeltsin said he believes it is possible to sign a joint 
agreement between leaders of Russia, the United States, Britain, 
France and Germany on "ending the bloodshed" in former 
Yugoslavia. 
  After laying a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier at 
the Kremlin wall on the occasion of the day of motherland 
defenders, Yeltsin said he had proposed that the leaders of 
Russia and the four major NATO member states meet in Moscow, 
Geneva or some other capital city for a day of talks and signing 
of "a document of historic significance." 
  He stressed that Russia must take part in resolving any 
major 
international issues and accused the west of attempting to 
deprive Moscow of any role in finding solutions to these issues. 
  "Attempts of certain leaders (of NATO) to keep Russia away 
from solving international security issues is a discrimination. 
Russia has to and will participate in all major international 
events as a permanent member of the UN Security council," the 
Russian president pointed out. 
  Yeltsin said Russia was outraged by the NATO ultimatum to 
Bosnian Serbs. 
  NATO's decision, he said, "without asking Russia, to bomb 
the 
Sarajevo region had made not only Russian diplomats but all 
Russian citizens indignant." 
  Yeltsin reiterated that Russia's efforts, including the trip 
of his special envoy Vitaliy Churkin to Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
averted the catastrophe. 
  Churkin negotiated a deal with Bosnian Serb leaders, under 
which the Serbs began pulling back their heavy weapons from 
around Sarajevo before the NATO deadline expired on February 20 
and Russia's 400 peacekeepers moved from Croatia to the besieged 
city to contribute to a peacekeeping force there.

  [Text] Belgrade, February 23 (XINHUA) -- The Bosnian Serb 
chief of staff, Manojlo Milovanovic, today denied that his 
troops had fired at the UN peacekeepers near Tuzla in 
northeastern Bosnia. 
  A UN spokesman said in New York today that it was the Muslim 
side who attacked the UN troops. But he did not denounce the 
Muslims. 
  The UN peacekeeping forces were reportedly attacked with 
mortars on Tuesday at Ribnica, some 20 kms southwest of Tuzla, 
with two military vehicles being hit and five Swedish soldiers 
wounded. 
  The chief of staff of the Nordic battalion in Tuzla said the 
fire "came from the area that is held by the Bosnian Serb army". 
  But Milovanovic said it was impossible for the Serb forces 
to 
bomb the place from their positions 22 kilometers away. 
  The Belgrade headquarters of UN peacekeeping forces in 
Bosnia 
said Croats and Muslims were fighting each other around Ribnica. 
  It remains unclear who shot at the UN peacekeepers. 
  The chief of staff of UN forces in Bosnia Angus Ramsay 
threatened air strikes against the Serb forces. 
  However, the commander of the UN forces in Bosnia, Michael 
Rose, ordered a careful investigation into the incident. 
  After the attack, the United Nations discussed the 
possibility of NATO air strikes against Tuzla area. 
  The UN has sent four fighter planes to fly over the area of 
northeastern Bosnia to investigate. 
  UN secretary-general's special envoy Yasushi Akashi refused 
the request for air strikes because "targets for strikes are 
unclear". 
  Since the UN peacekeeping forces were sent to the former 
Yugoslavia, 76 UN soldiers have been killed and 830 injured. 
  The western nations have recently asked to reopen the Tuzla 
airport by force to guarantee the convey of humanitarian aid. 
  They warned that if Serbs opposed the plan, NATO would 
launch 
air strikes against the Serb positions. 
  Observers said that attacks on the UN troops might become an 
excuse for NATO air strikes on Serb-held positions near the 
Tuzla airport.

  [Text] United Nations, February 22 (XINHUA) -- Participants 
of the Bonn meeting on Bosnia will concentrate on how to achieve 
a lasting peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina quickly, according to the 
press guidelines for the meeting today. 
  Urging the warring parties in bosnia to grasp the chance for 
peace now, diplomats from the European Union, Canada, the 
Russian Federation and the United States as well as a U.N. 
representative decided to use the current momentum deriving from 
the success in Sarajevo to work closely together to promote an 
early negotiated settlement between them, said the guidelines 
released here. 
  "The participants proceed from the basis that the parties 
have already agreed to the quantitative territorial aspects of a 
settlement, as outlined in the European Union action plan, but 
that the quality and viability of territory for the Bosnian 
Government needs to be improved," the guidelines said. 
  In Sarajevo, efforts will be made to stabilize the ceasefire 
by effective disengagement of forces, ensure free access to 
Sarajevo by land for humanitarian aid convoys and restore normal 
life to the city with the assistance of the United Nations, said 
the guidelines. 
  To create necessary conditions to facilitate a peaceful 
solution and to alleviate the suffering of the civilians until a 
settlement is achieved, efforts also include rapid rotation of 
U.N. forces into Srebrenica and Zepa and rapid opening of the 
Tuzla airport for humanitarian aid deliveries, the guidelines 
added. 
  The participants in the one-day meeting welcomed the recent 
developments in and around Sarajevo as an important step towards 
ending the war throughout the former Yugoslav republic.

  [Text] London, February 19 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton will take British Prime Minister John Major on a visit 
to Pittsburgh and invite him to sleep at the White House in an 
attempt to ease strained relations between the two leaders, 
REUTER NEWS AGENCY reported today. 
  The visit, on February 28, "follows a suggestion made by the 
President last year after learning that the prime minister's 
father and grandfather had lived and worked in the Pittsburgh 
area," White House Spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said in a statement. 
  Following a "working evening and dinner" in the Pennsylvania 
city, northwest of Washington, the two leaders will return to 
the White House, where Major will spend the night as Clinton's 
guest. 
  It marks the first time Clinton has travelled outside 
Washington with foreign head of state and the first time he has 
invited a foreign leader to sleep at the White House. 
  Major will leave for a four-day visit to Washington on 
February 27. He met Clinton in Washington last February shortly 
after Clinton took office. 
  However, the traditional "special relationship" between the 
United States and Britain has become cool after Major's 
conservative government support Former President George Bush 
during 1992 presidential campaign. 
  Last month, Clinton offended Britain by allowing the leader 
of the IRA's [Irish Republican Army] political wing Sinn Fein, 
Gerry Adams, to enter America for the first time in the past 20 
years. 
  There was still differences between the two countries on 
Bosnia as London urged Washington to play a more active role in 
the peace process and contribute troops to the U.N. peacekeeping 
operations.

  [Text] Washington, February 18 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President 
Bill Clinton talked by telephone with African National Congress 
(ANC) President Nelson Mandela today and welcomed his steps to 
push all groups participate in South African's first all-race 
elections. 
  White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers told reporters 
that 
Mandela initiated the 10-minute call to Clinton to discuss the 
steps that the ANC has taken in recent days to facilitate the 
participation of all parties in the April 27-28 elections. 
  "Mandela said that these measures included proposals for a 
constitutional principle respecting the right of 
self-determination, safeguards for the powers of regional 
governments and extension of the deadline for parties to 
register for the election," Myers said. 
  Clinton welcomed the steps and told Mandela that he and 
other 
parties had gone "the extra mile to accommodate the concerns of 
all the parties in South Africa," she said. 
  Clinton also told Mandela that the United States "will 
continue to work to persuade all groups in South Africa that 
participation in the upcoming elections is the best route for 
them to influence the future course of their country.

2052): "U.S.-Japanese Trade Conflict Sharpens"] 
  [Text] Washington, 13 Feb (RENMIN RIBAO)--Between 10 and 
12 February, Japanese Prime Minister Morihito Hosokawa made a 
three-day visit to the United States and held talks with U.S. 
President Clinton on bilateral trade relations. Because neither 
side made concessions, no agreement was reached. This shows 
that after the end of the Cold War, economic and trade 
contradictions between the two countries have become sharper. 
  Japan is the second largest trade partner of the United 
States. Trade frictions have continuously existed between the 
two countries for a long time, and the main problem is the 
increasingly serious imbalance in bilateral trade. According to 
statistics from the U.S. side, Japan's trade surplus with the 
United States has increased year after year, and amounted to $54 
billion between January and November 1993. In order to solve 
the trade imbalance issue, Clinton reached a "framework 
agreement" last July in Tokyo with former Japanese Prime 
Minister Miyazawa to make Japan open its markets wider and to 
reduce its trade surplus with the United States. In the 
agreement, the Japanese side promised to adopt measures to 
stimulate economic growth, increase imports, and reduce its 
trade surplus. In more concrete terms, Japan agreed to increase 
imports of autos and auto parts, telecommunications equipment, 
medical equipment, and services from the United States. The 
framework agreement stipulated that the leaders of the two 
countries would hold talks twice a year. The two sides planned 
to reach concrete agreements on implementing the "framework 
agreement" at the recent summit meeting. 
  At the meeting, the positions of the two sides were distant. 
Hosokawa put forth his plan to stimulate economic growth in 
Japan. The plan will cost $140 billion, and it includes such 
measures as reducing individual income taxes, stimulating 
consumer purchasing power, and increasing imports. However, the 
U.S. Government was not satisfied with this and held that the 
plan was not effective enough to bring about substantial changes 
in the Japanese economy and did not guarantee an expansion of 
imports from the United States. The U.S. side insisted that 
Japan should have "objective standards" for expanding the 
openness of its market and should lay down "quantitative 
targets" for imports. Japan refused to accept this, holding 
that this would be de facto "managed trade," which goes against 
the principle of free trade. As the two leaders held tough 
positions, the talks inevitably broke down. Observers here held 
that the U.S.-Japanese trade conflict can mainly be attributed 
to the following factors. First, after the end of the Cold War, 
the Untied States gave top priority to correcting its trade 
imbalance with Japan in its Japanese policy, and it is 
impossible for Japan to require the United States to make 
concessions on the grounds of "strengthening global cooperation 
between Japan and the United States." Before Hosokawa visited 
the United States this time, the Japanese foreign minister 
arrived in Washington one day earlier and met with a lot of key 
diplomats and security officials on the U.S. side in the hope 
that U.S. officials would persuade American business circles, as 
they had done before, and would thus make concessions. However, 
he found that the U.S. officials held the same position and in 
turn required the Japanese side to make concessions. Second, 
the Clinton administration has found it harder to endure the 
increasing trade deficits incurred by its country, and resolved 
to adopt tough measures to reduce the trade deficit with Japan 
for the sake of the U.S. economy and employment prospects. 
  At the summit meeting, the Japanese side did not give an 
impression of weakness. Japan opposed the adoption of 
quantitative targets. On the one hand, it does not want to 
subject itself to U.S. controls; on the other hand, Japan has 
not yet recovered from its most serious economic recession since 
the end of World War II and is finding it hard to increase 
imports. As both the United States and Japan have to proceed 
from their respective interests, it will be hard for them to 
actually solve their trade frictions.

2052): "Japanese-U.S. Relations Viewed From Breakdown of Trade 
Talks"] 
  [Text] Tokyo, Feb 13 (RENMIN RIBAO)--When discussing the 
recent Japanese-U.S. trade summit meeting, Japanese public 
opinion paid more attention to the impact of the event on 
Japanese-U.S. relations. 
  Japanese-U.S. trade frictions have lasted for 30 years. In 
this period, the two countries continued to hold talks and 
continued to work out new programs in an attempt to solve or 
mitigate frictions. The latest round of such talks began after 
the G-7 summit meeting in Tokyo last July. 
  An interesting fact was that the breakdown of the talks this 
time did not cause the host and the guest to leave each other 
unhappily. At the news conference, the two leaders made rather 
frank speeches which were benign on their overall relations. 
After admitting that the talks had broken down, Clinton said 
that it was better to have reached no agreement than to have 
reached an empty agreement. Hosokawa said that frankly admitting 
things that could not be done was a demonstration of the 
maturity of bilateral relations. The two leaders both agreed 
that the breakdown of their economic talks would not affect the 
cooperative Japanese-U.S. relationship in global affairs. 
  Public opinion here pointed out that all the previous 
economic talks between the Japan and the United States ended 
with Japanese concessions. This time, Japan explicitly said 
"no," and this was also the first time Japan had done this. 
After the breakdown of the talks, both sides frankly admitted 
the fact of the breakdown and said that this would not affect 
bilateral relations. This was also an unprecedented event. 
Therefore, public opinion in Japan was rather elated at this 
result. Japanese commentators said that although the talks did 
not succeed, a new relationship of "being able to speak frankly" 
between Japan and the United States had been established beyond 
expectations. This was of great significance to Japan. 
  The dissolution of the Cold War-oriented world pattern has 
weakened the binding force among Western countries, which have 
attached greater importance to their respective national 
interests in approaching their mutual relations. Among the 
three major pillars of their relations, namely, political, 
security, and economic pillars, the first two have become less 
and less important, while the economic factor has become the 
main factor deciding relations between the Western countries. 
  While major changes have occurred in the international 
situation, the status of the United States is also becoming much 
weaker than before, and Japan is adopting a much stronger sense 
of being a big power. Such an objective situation has forced 
the United States to attach importance to the principle of 
"reaching agreement through consultations" in approaching its 
relations with other Western countries. Eventually, Japan dared 
to say "no" in the talks, and this could only appear in a book 
rather than in reality a few years ago. 
  After the recent talks, will Japan really be able to stand 
on 
an equal footing with the United States? While expressing its 
happiness, Japanese public opinion also paid attention to the 
fact that after the breakdown of the talks, the hawk faction on 
the U.S. side demanded that "Super 301" should be applied to 
impose sanctions against Japan; they also noted that the U.S. 
side this time was unconcerned mainly because it had confidence 
derived from the beginning of its economic recovery. Therefore, 
Japanese commentators said that while saying "no," Japan should 
still take some initiatives in the economic field. Under the 
current changeable and complicated international situation, the 
development of Japanese-U.S. relations after the recent summit 
meeting will become more significant.

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Chen Jinjun: "NZ, U.S. Still Differ on </F>
Nuclear Issue"] 
  [Text] Wellington, February 22 (XINHUA) -- New Zealand's 
anti-nuclear legislation still remains as a hinderer to closer 
relations with the United States despite the U.S. decision to 
lift the restraints on senior-level contacts between the two 
countries. 
  The U.S. decision, announced last Friday [18 February], was 
welcomed by NZ Prime Minister Jim Bolger as a "positive step" 
taken by President Bill Clinton. 
  Bolger said the resumption of senior-level contacts will 
"enable us to have the kind of dialogue commensurate with our 
shared interest and values, on both bilateral and broader 
strategic issues." 
  He even suggested that the move could open the way to joint 
military exercises run by a third country. 
  However, the U.S. thinks otherwise. Announcing the decision, 
the State Department said the decision does not signify a 
restoration of the United States' defense obligations to New 
Zealand. 
  It said the U.S. Administration, while recognizing that the 
two countries have important business to conduct outside the 
area of defense relations, agreed to continue to press for a 
change in New Zealand's anti-nuclear legislation. 
  The NZ [New Zealand]-U.S. relations soured in 1985 after New 
Zealand refused entry to its ports by the U.S. Navy ship 
"Buchanan" for fear that the ship might be equipped with nuclear 
weapons. In 1987, it passed the anti-nuclear legislation 
banning visits by warships and military planes suspected of 
carrying nuclear arms. 
  Washington retaliated by imposing the restraints on 
high-level contacts with New Zealand, and later suspended its 
obligations under the ANZUS (Australia, New Zealand, the United 
States) treaty. 
  Although tactical nuclear weapons are said to have been 
removed from U.S. vessels, the U.S. military still insists on 
neither confirming nor denying the presence of nuclear weapons 
on U.S. warships. 
  Observers here believed that despite the resumption of 
senior-level contacts, the nuclear issue is still essential to 
closer ties between the two countries [as received], 
particularly in the area of defense. 
  The New Zealand Government is unlikely to take any move 
toward modifying its anti-nuclear stance in view of its one-vote 
majority in the parliament. Bolger has made it clear that there 
will be no change to New Zealand's anti-nuclear legislation to 
accommodate the U.S. position.

<F P=106> [Article by Sheng Baoliang (4141 1405 5328): "An Important </F>
Change in the International Multilateral Trade System--From GATT 
to the World Trade Organization"] 
  [Text] GATT, which has represented the global 
multinational trade system for a long time, will soon be 
replaced by a new world trade organization. 
  This is an important decision made at the GATT Uruguay Round 
talks as well as an important change in the international 
multilateral trade system. According to the schedule in the 
wake of the Uruguay Round, the World Trade Organization will 
probably take effect on 1 July 1995, but the exact date will be 
finally fixed at the Uruguay Round ministerial meeting in 
Morocco this April. 
  The idea and proposal of establishing a world trade 
organization was put forward by the EC and Canada in the later 
stages of the Uruguay Round talks. However, they called it a 
multilateral trade organization which was intended to 
effectively implement the results of the Uruguay Round talks, 
expand the scope of GATT, and include the results of the Uruguay 
Round talks on the three new areas of intellectual property 
rights, investment measures, and service trade in the legal 
framework of the multilateral trade system and make GATT an 
official international trade organization and a permanent 
international trade agreement. 
  The basic principles and goals of the World Trade 
Organization are basically the same as those of GATT, that is, 
to promote the achievement of the goal of liberalizing world 
trade through implementing the principles of market opening, 
nondiscrimination, and fair trade. However, the former 
represents world trade in a wider scope, is more formal in 
organizational structure and legally, and has a much wider scope 
of functions. This is concretely embodied in the following 
aspects: 
  The World Trade Organization is very wide-ranging in 
content. 
It not only includes the goods trading rules which are 
traditional and which were amended in the Uruguay Round, but 
extends the world trade rules to such new areas as farm 
products, which have long been excluded from GATT, and 
investment measures, intellectual property rights, and the 
service trade. As an official international trade organization, 
it makes up for the shortcomings of GATT and is legally on an 
equal footing with other international organizations. It has a 
larger scope of functions. In addition to GATT's original 
functions of organizing the implementation of multilateral and 
submultilateral [ci duo bian 2945 1122 6708] trade agreements, 
offering an arena for multilateral trade talks, and acting as a 
forum, it will also be responsible for periodically examining 
the trade policies of its members, handle trade disputes between 
members, and be responsible for strengthening cooperation with 
the IMF, the World Bank, and their subsidiary organizations so 
as to achieve uniformity in global economic policy. All 
agreements (excluding several submultilateral agreements such as 
government purchase agreements) will be a unified agreement and 
a basket of agreements and will not allow for optional signing. 
It will considerably amend the mutually inapplicable GATT 
clauses and allow its members to negotiate with a new joining 
party on tariff reductions and concessions. But upon the entry 
of the new joining party, the two sides have the right to 
determine that their clauses are mutually inapplicable to each 
other. 
  Unlike GATT, since the World Trade Organization will be an 
official international organization, all joining parties will be 
called "members." The World Trade Organization will have two 
types of membership status, namely founding member and new 
joining member. 
  Founding members must possess the following qualifications, 
neither of which are dispensable: They must be GATT members 
when the World Trade Organization takes effect; they must sign a 
basket of Uruguay Round agreements; they must make tariff and 
nontariff reductions and concessions, and reductions and 
concessions in the area of the service trade in the Uruguay 
Round and make these reductions and concessions part of the 
Uruguay Round reductions and concessions list and the reductions 
and concessions list of the service trade general agreement. 
  New joining member of the World Trade Organization refers to 
a country or an independent tariff region which possesses full 
rights over foreign trade that has become a member after 
negotiating joining conditions with the World Trade Organization 
after the World Trade Organization agreement takes effect. A 
decision of the World Trade Organization regarding acceptance of 
a new member must be approved by a two-thirds majority at a 
ministerial meeting. 
  The establishment of the World Trade Organization will have 
a 
huge and far-reaching influence on standardizing and managing 
the future world economy and trade and on promoting the 
liberalization of global trade to a much greater extent and in a 
much wider scope. The World Trade Organization has inherited and 
developed the open and cooperative multilateral trade system 
represented by GATT, and thus greatly enhances people's 
confidence in the multilateral trade system. This is the motive 
power for the multilateral trade system to be long-lasting. The 
series of agreements under its jurisdiction will become new 
"traffic rules" for future world trade and will help ensure that 
international trade proceeds under normal order. 
  Since the Uruguay Round trade liberalization measures 
concretely organized for implementation by the World Trade 
Organization will make all markets around the world more open 
and enable them to gradually benefit from this, it is 
undoubtedly very conducive to promoting international trade and 
economic growth and to increasing the employment opportunities 
of all countries. Its unified dispute resolution mechanism will 
mediate international trade disputes much more quickly and 
effectively and will to some extent reduce the unilateral 
retaliative acts of some big trading nations. 
  Nevertheless, as a product of the Uruguay Round, the World 
Trade Organization has some shortcomings due to the limitations 
of the Uruguay Round. It does not take into sufficient 
consideration the interests of developing countries, in 
particular. It has not resolved all problems in the sphere of 
international trade, such as the issues of trade and the 
environment and the issue of restrictive commercial practices. 
  The Uruguay Round has only temporarily balanced the 
international trade interests of some Western powers. Following 
the implementation of a basket of Uruguay Round agreements, they 
will unavoidably have new contradictions and conflicts of 
interests and will need the World Trade Organization to 
coordinate and resolve them. Therefore, the tasks faced by the 
World Trade Organization will be very heavy.

  [Text] Beijing, 24 Feb (XINHUA) -- A Sino-U.S. seminar on 
legislation on intellectual property rights [IPR] was held in 
Beijing yesterday. 
  Since 1992, China has promulgated and implemented the 
"Patent 
Law," the "Trademark Law," the "Copyright Law," the "Law Against 
Unfair Competition," and other laws and statutes; and has joined 
the world IPR organization, the Paris Convention for protecting 
industrial property rights, the World Copyright Convention, and 
the Patent Cooperation Agreement; thereby establishing a 
world-class system for protecting IPR. At the seminar, 
officials from the U.S. Justice Department and Customs explained 
the enforcement of U.S. legislation to protect IPR, and offered 
suggestions on how China could protect IPR. The seminar was 
attended by representatives from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign 
Trade and Economic Cooperation, the State Science and Technology 
Commission, and other ministries and commissions concerned. 
Officials from the State Copyright Bureau and Trademark Bureau 
gave briefings on the protection of copyright and the 
implementation of the trademark law in China, as well as 
measures being taken in these areas.

  [Text] Beijing, February 23 (XINHUA) -- China's 
Vice-Premier Li Lanqing met here this afternoon with Lawrence S. 
Eagleburger, former U.S. secretary of state, and his party. 
  Li said that Sino-U.S. relations do not only concern the 
fundamental interests of the two peoples, but also is of vital 
importance to world peace and stability. 
  He said that Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations are a 
very important part of overall Sino-U.S. relations and China's 
policy of reform and opening to the outside is irreversible and 
would develop n further. 
  He noted that the two economies are strongly complementary, 
each having its own characteristics and advantages, and the two 
countries should seize the opportunity to expand exchanges and 
cooperation in the fields of economy, trade, science and 
technology in the interests of the two peoples. 
  Eagleburger said that economic and trade relations between 
China and the U.S. are as important as bilateral political 
relations. 
  He said that there are some difficulties in bilateral 
relations at present but these can be overcome. The bilateral 
relations must be improved. 
  U.S. ambassador to China J. Stapleton Roy was present at the 
meeting.

  [Text] Washington, February 23 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President 
Bill Clinton said today the United States will pursue 
aggressively the case of CIA officer working for the former 
Soviet Union and Russia since 1985. 
  While waiting fro a formal response from the Russians, 
Clinton stressed the seriousness of the case but said Washington 
would continue to pursue its supportive policy toward President 
Boris Yeltsin. 
  Clinton said he had already had a preliminary assessment of 
the damage caused by Aldrich Ames's selling of vital CIA 
operations and personnel information to the Russians. 
  On the capitol, secretary of state Warren Christopher said, 
"the extent of the effect of this incident on our relationship 
with Russia will depend upon Russian actions in the days ahead." 
  "Events in Russia over the past few weeks have revived our 
fears about the future," Christopher said. 
  "Let me emphasize the United States will take every measure 
to protect the United States and prevent such activities from 
being carried out in the future," Christopher told a Senate 
hearing on U.S. foreign policy. 
  Ames, 52, had been worked for the CIA for 31 years before 
arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigations on Monday [21 
February]. He is allegedly to have provided Moscow with vital 
information in return for more than 1.5 million dollars. 
  Ames' wife, a 41-year-old Colombian native who worked for 
the 
CIA as a Colombian Embassy employee in Mexico City, Mexico, also 
was arrested, she is now a naturalized U.S. citizen. 
  She is said to be cooperating with the authorities, even 
before Monday's arrest, partly because of concerns over her 
young son, reports said. 
  As Washington gauges the extent of the damage done to its 
national security, reports are emerging that at least two Soviet 
citizens spying for CIA were killed shortly after Ames disclosed 
their identities to Russian intelligence agencies. 
  Ames and his wife face a maximum penalty of life 
imprisonment 
and a fine of 250,000 million dollars for each.

  [Text] Washington, feburary 22 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. Senate 
confirmed today well-known journalist Strobe Talbott as deputy 
secretary of state. 
  Talbott was named to replace Clifton Wharton, Clinton's 
highest-ranking black official, who resigned on November 8 last 
year under pressure after eight months of intense criticism of 
Clinton's foreign policy team for the handling of the Bosnia, 
Somalia and Haiti issues. 
  The vote to confirm Talbott was 66-31. 
  After the confirmation, Talbott will enter a key 
policy-making circle at the U.S. State department, responsible 
for overall management of the department. 
  An expert on Russia and a longtime friend of President 
Clinton, Talbott was named last April as an ambassador-at-large 
to the former Soviet Union. 
  Talbott, a native of Dayton, Ohio state of mid-west U.S., 
graduated from Yale University in 1968, and began his journalist 
career in 1971 when he was assigned to Eastern Europe as a 
correspondent for the U.S. "TIME" magazine. 
  Among the most famous works he has done is the translation 
and editing of the three-volume memoir of the late Soviet leader 
Nikita Khrushchev.

  [Text] Beijing, 16 Feb (XINHUA) -- China's Animal and Plant 
Quarantine Department recently decided that it would agree on 
the conditional importing of apples from Washington state. For 
this purpose, the State General Institute of Animal and Plant 
Quarantine and the Animal and the Plant Health Inspection 
Service under the U.S. Department of Agriculture recently signed 
the "Plant Hygiene Conditions for the Export to China of Apples 
From Washington State in the United States." 
  In recent years, domestic demands for imported fruit have 
been growing steadily. To enhance bilateral trade between China 
and the United States and to meet the demands of the domestic 
market, China's animal and plant quarantine organ has, on the 
basis of widely collected relevant information, formed a 
specific group to carry out a study of the destructive nature of 
insect pests which might be present in apples imported from the 
United States. Based on their scientific analysis, experts hold 
that Washington state is not included in the area infested by 
the Mediterranean fruit fly, and that apples produced by this 
state may be exported to China with conditions. According to 
the agreement signed between China and the United States 
governing the plant-hygiene condition of apples to be imported 
from Washington state, the apples to be exported to China must 
be produced by orchards designated by the Chinese State General 
Institute of Animal and Plant Quarantine, and must be packed, 
frozen, and stored by designated factories. During the process 
of packing and prior to export, they must be strictly inspected 
by the U.S. animal and plant quarantine organ and it must be 
guaranteed that they meet the quarantine requirements as imposed 
by China. Moreover, upon their arrival in China, the apples 
exported to China must enter the country through designated 
ports and must be quarantined and cleared by a Chinese animal 
and plant quarantine organ before they are allowed to be put on 
sale. 
  The Mediterranean fruit fly is a destructive pest to fruit, 
one from which China is free. To prevent it from entering 
China, and to safeguard China's fruit production, China has 
banned the import of fruit from the United States and other 
countries affected by the pest. The current lifting of the ban 
is confined to apples produced by Washington state and shipped 
directly to China.

  [Text] Moscow, February 23 (XINHUA) -- Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin said in a written statement today that Russia 
would always have a role in resolving major international 
issues, and that no one should ever attempt to discriminate 
against Russia. 
  The statement was published in leaflets handed out by 
Yeltsin's Press Secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov here today, 
ITAR-TASS reported. 
  Following Russia's diplomatic success in persuading Serb 
forces to pull back their big guns from around Sarajevo, NATO 
officials and some senior Western diplomats made various 
statements which seemed to express some "feeling of 
disappointment", the statement said. 
  This sentiment reflects the position that NATO desired to 
"restore order" itself, and did not appreciate the role played 
by Russia, the statement said. Some people apparently wished to 
stifle Russia's bid to settle the conflict through diplomatic 
means, it added. 
  As a result, some have the impression that NATO still clings 
to the old Cold War ideology, and that psychologically it is 
difficult for NATO to adapt to political realities in Russia, 
which have undergone drastic changes in recent years, the 
statement continued. 
  Russia opposes ultimatums and prefers mediation, the 
statement said, adding that any attempt to restore the Cold War 
mentality, distrust, and spy wars run counter to the spirit of 
partnership for peace. 
  The Russian president said in his statement that he believes 
there are more reasons for peace than for war in Europe. He 
again called on Western leaders to sit down at the negotiating 
table to work out a final settlement of the Bosnian conflict.

  [Text] Washington, February 20 (XINHUA) -- President Bill 
Clinton agreed today with Russian leader Boris Yeltsin that 
experts of the U.S., Russia, France, Britain and Germany on 
Bosnia will meet on Bosnia in Bonn, Germany, on Tuesday [22 
February]. 
  During a 20-minute telephone conversation, Clinton and 
Yeltsin exchanged their views on the current Bosnian situation 
and agreed that the Bosnian parties were moving in a right 
direction. 
  Clinton, who also talked to NATO Secretary-General Manfred 
Woerner by phone in the afternoon, will call French President 
Francois Mitterrand later in the day, the CABLE NEWS NETWORK 
(CNN) reported. 
  Senior administration officials said that developments in 
the 
Bosnian capital were encouraging and the likelihood of NATO air 
strikes appeared diminishing. 
  Clinton will dispatch his envoy on Bosnia Charles Redman and 
Assistant Secretary of European Affairs Steven Oxman to the Bonn 
meeting on how to urge the Bosnian warring sides to move further 
toward a peaceful settlement, cnn said. 
  According to a NATO ultimatum issued on February 9, the 
Bosnian Serbs have to move all their heavy weapons from Sarajevo 
or put them under U.N. control by midnight today, Greenwich Mean 
Time. 
  Despite the encouraging signs, U.S. officials said, there 
were still less than 20 Bosnian Serb gun sites not yet secured 
by U.N. forces. 
  In Moscow, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has 
already 
ruled out the possibility of NATO air strikes against the 
Bosnian Serbs. 
  Grachev, appearing in a Russian television program, said 
U.S. 
Secretary of Defense William Perry called him earlier today and 
made certain on his assessment. 
  "No air-strikes on positions of Bosnian Serbs provided for 
by 
the ultimatum of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will be 
made by the NATO aviation today," Grachev said.

  [Text] Bonn, February 22 (XINHUA) -- Russia opposes the 
extension of the Sarajevo cease-fire model to other besieged 
areas in Bosnia, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin 
said here today. 
  Russia "firmly rules out" the possibility of extending the 
Sarajevo cease-fire model and rejects "any repetition of the 
NATO ultimatum in other parts of Bosnia," Churkin said after a 
meeting with diplomats from other nations on peace in Bosnia. 
  In a joint statement, ranking officials from the U.S., 
Canada, the UN and European Union member states, said the latest 
developments in Sarajevo represent a "major step toward an end 
to the whole Bosnian war." 
  The participants expressed grave concerns about the serious 
situation in other parts of Bosnia and their readiness to 
cooperate closely, by taking advantage of the current positive 
factors, to bring about a settlement to the conflict through 
negotiations. 
  The participants also said in the statement that they would 
seek to improve the humanitarian situation in Serb-encircled 
enclaves and pressure Muslims and Croats for a cease-fire in 
central Bosnia and the southern city of Mostar. 
  Meanwhile, they warned the serbs not to move to other war 
fronts any of the artillery they had pulled back from around 
Sarajevo before the deadline of the NATO ultimatum which expired 
peacefully on February 20. 
  Churkin, who is also Russia's special envoy for former 
Yugoslavia, said the participants discussed measures for peace 
that can all be achieved without the use of force. 
  "There was no attempt to resort to strong language at this 
meeting because we're acting together," he said. 
  The final step of the Serb withdrawal over the weekend in 
accordance with NATO's demands was negotiated by Russia, which 
has traditionally maintained close ties with the Serbs. 
  Russia has sent 400 troops as UN peacekeepers to Sarajevo to 
help monitor the cease-fire. 
  Therefore, Churkin said, Russia's message to Europe and the 
United States was, "when you get in trouble with the Serbs, 
before raising hell please turn to us. Maybe we can resolve it 
without any difficulties." 
  He agreed to use Russian influence with the Serbs to get 
Tuzla airport re-opened, a long-time demand of Western 
governments. 
  Tuzla is the eastern Bosnian base for aid agencies to send 
emergency relief supplies to the local people. Its airport lies 
within the range of Serb artillery. 
  The Russian envoy also urged U.S. President Bill Clinton to 
send American soldiers to Sarajevo. But Clinton has offered to 
send troops only after a peace agreement. 
  During the meeting, the participants agreed with Russia's 
proposal to use the momentum from the Sarajevo cease-fire to 
push for political progress in the war-torn republic as a whole.

  [Text] Moscow, February 23 (XINHUA) -- Russia failed to 
brake its economic decline in 1993 and is facing a deteriorating 
situation this year. 
  According to a report on the economic development in 1993 
and 
the outlook for 1994 issued by the Economic Ministry and the 
State Statistical Committee to the State Duma members, the 
country's gross national product (GNP) in 1993 dropped by 12 
percent from 1992, while the industrial production decreased by 
16 percent. 
  The country's industrial production has gone down sharply 
since the beginning of 1994, with a 23.1-percent drop in January 
over the same period of 1992, the report said. 
  Unemployment was increasing rapidly and had reached 7.7 
million by the end of last year, the report added. 
  The country's inflation also remained high last year. All 
prices for consumer goods were soaring by 8.4 times while those 
for manufactured goods went up by nine times. 
  Russia also faces a grim situation in regard to its foreign 
economic relations and foreign exchange which the country badly 
needs for investment in some projects and for support for 
ongoing economic reform. 
  Meanwhile, the funds allocated by the government in the 
budget to the country's science and technology also decreased in 
1993.

  [Text] Beijing, Feb. 23 KYODO -- Vice Premier Zhu Rongji 
said Wednesday [23 February] he will continue his dual role as 
governor of the People's Bank of China and reiterated that 
China's economy will not become overheated. 
  "Since we started implementing macroeconomic adjustment and 
controls last year it has become apparent that the position of 
governor of China's central bank is not a popular post," Zhu 
told reporters at Beijing Airport before leaving on a nine-day 
visit to Japan. 
  "There are not many people who want the post of governor of 
the Central Bank of China, so I have to continue to work in this 
capacity," he said. 
  Zhu, who is seen as the main architect of China's 
far-reaching economic reform, has been the center of rumors that 
he would give up his banking post after next month's session of 
the National People's Congress, or China's legislature. 
  "As a matter of fact the work of the central bank is now the 
responsibility of vice governors like Zhou Zhengqing and Wu 
Xiangwen... My function is only one of a shield and it seems 
that I'll continue to play this role," he said. 
  Zhu also dismissed reports that recent macroeconomic 
controls 
were failing and the economy was in danger of overheating, while 
reiterating that this year's growth rate would be around 9 
percent and could rise in the future. 
  "At present the economic growth rate is rather high. That is 
because judging from the economic realities in China, we do not 
want to see big ups and downs," he said. 
  "Therefore what we want is to keep a speed that is 
sustainable and healthy. If the speed is brought down quickly, 
artificially, that will lead to social instability," he said. 
  Zhu also dismissed worries over the tightening and relaxing 
of controls over the money supply, saying the intensification of 
such controls would depend on the "realities of the national 
economy."

  [Text] Tokyo, February 23 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice Premier 
Zhu Rongji today told a group of Japanese business leaders that 
China has been carrying out its far-reaching reform program 
smoothly since the beginning of this year when a package of 
important reform bills took effect. 
  Zhu, who arrived in Japan this afternoon for a nine-day 
official visit, made the remark during a dinner given in his 
honor by Gaishi Hiraiwa, head of the powerful Federation of 
Economic Organizations (Keidanren). 
  "The smooth implementation of reform policies has 
consolidated our resolve to move further ahead with them," a 
senior Chinese Foreign Ministry official quoted him as saying. 
  The vice premier praised the Keidanren for having made a 
"precious contribution" to the promotion of bilateral trade and 
economic cooperation between China and Japan. 
  Hiraiwa said that he is interested in China's economy 
building program and told Zhu that the Keidanren set up its 
China committee last may in order to further speed up economic 
ties between the two nations, the Foreign Ministry official said. 
  Earlier in the day, in a meeting with Kosaku Inaba, chairman 
of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Zhu said that 
this year is crucial for China to implement its economic reforms. 
  He told Inaba that the current economic situation in China 
is 
good and according to the ministry official the vice premier 
said: "markets and prices in China are stable as are people's 
lives."

  [Text] Tokyo, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
Zhu Rongji said today relations between China and Japan have 
made "a positive impact" on peace and stability in the 
Asian-Pacific region and the world at large. 
  The year of 1992 marked the entry of the bilateral 
relationship into a new phase of development, Zhu, here on a 
nine-day official visit, said in a speech titled "China's Reform 
and Development in 1994." 
  In 1992, Chinese Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin visited 
Tokyo while Japanese Emperor Akihito traveled to Beijing in 
celebration of the 20th anniversary of the normalization of 
diplomatic ties, he explained. 
  "The Chinese Government and people attach great importance 
to 
their good neighborly relations with Japan," he said. 
  He said China shares much in common with Japan and the two 
countries complement each other economically. 
  Bilateral trade totaled 39 billion U.S. dollars last year, 
an increase of 54 percent over the previous year, the 
vice-premier noted.

  [Text] Tokyo, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Chinese 
Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji said today that China has not changed 
and will not change its preferential policies it has promised to 
all foreign firms despite recent reforms on taxation and 
enterprises. 
  "You can rest assured that China will never change its fixed 
policy of opening the door to the outside world," Zhu said in a 
speech titled "China's Reform and Development in 1994." 
  Zhu, who arrived here Wednesday for a nine-day visit, said 
China will instead open wider to the outside world and 
positively participate in competition and economic cooperation. 
  The recent reform measures taken by the government are 
designed to adapt China to the laws of the international economy 
and create a better environment for foreign investment in China, 
he said. 
  He admitted that some government institutions' failure to 
link up the work during the early stage of promulgations of the 
reform laws has caused concerns among foreign investors over the 
preferential policies.

  [Text] Tokyo, February 24 (XINHUA) -- China's Vice-Premier 
Zhu Rongji today renewed the government's resolve to push 
forward the reform drive this year in a bid to lay a solid 
groundwork for a socialist market economy. 
  In a speech to a gathering of 1,000 leading Japanese 
businessmen, Zhu warned that China's economic development would 
lag much behind and the nation would miss a chance to modernize 
itself if the reform efforts failed. 
  China made "brilliant achievements" in its economic reform 
and modernization program during 1993, which saw a growth of 13 
percent in its gross national product (GNP) after a continuously 
speedy rise for more than 10 years, he said. 
  The GNP in 1993 trippled that in 1978 when China began to 
pursue its policy of opening up, Zhu said in his speech entitled 
"China's Reform and Development in 1994." 
  During the last 15 years, China has achieved great progress 
in carrying out reform and developing the economy. 
  "We have successfully avoided radical ups and downs and 
maintained social and political stability while great changes 
have taken place in the country's economic system and social 
structure," Zhu said. 
  He dispelled concerns that China's economy would overheat 
and 
the current development speed would not last long. 
  While admitting some overheating symptoms caused by derailed 
stock deals, real estate speculation and an overabundance of 
investment projects during the first half of last year, Zhu 
stressed that the Chinese Government had taken effective 
macro-economic control measures since last June to maintain a 
sustained, speedy and healthy development of the national 
economy. 
  "The trend of a possible economic overheating has been now 
brought under control, the monetary supply order and the 
circulation order have been improved, and some exciting 
achievements have been achieved," he said. 
  He dismissed overseas reports that China's credit policy had 
failed and explained that the government's decision to tighten 
credit made last year was designed to orient investment to the 
needs of key state construction projects. 
  "In short, we took macro-economic control measures in 
accordance with the reality of the Chinese economy. This is in 
keeping with the laws of market economy as well as the actual 
situation in China," he said. 
  One of the successes in macro management, he said, was a 
rise 
in the country's foreign currency reserves last year despite the 
registration of a 10-billion U.S. dollar trade deficit. 
  Zhu told the gathering that this year was a crucial stage 
for 
China in transforming the economic system while keeping the 
current development momentum. 
  To this end, the Chinese Government launched complex reforms 
at the beginning of this year on finance, taxation, monetary 
supply, exchange rates and state enterprises and has been 
implementing them smoothly since then. 
  Zhu, however, pointed to some problems that could undermine 
the reform efforts if not solved. 
  He cited last November's steep rise in grain prices, and 
panic buying of electronic appliances triggered by 
misunderstanding of the reform bills and fears of a possible 
rekindling of the high inflation that prevailed in 1988 and 1989. 
  "The price turbulence signaled clearly that we still need to 
keep vigilance on the economic situation, for reform embraces 
risks," he said. 
  Dismissing arguments that it is immature to proceed with 
all-round reforms at this moment, Zhu said, "I believe it is 
the very right time to completely push forward the drive." 
  The vice-premier explained that this was because the 
government's reform policy was deeply rooted within the hearts 
of the Chinese people. 
  Secondly, he said, the government had accumulated 
experiences 
on reform over the past 15 years and had already mapped out a 
blueprint and an action program on reform for the next few years 
in line with a consensus arrived at among Chinese leaders. 
  Thirdly, the rapid economic development and the resulting 
improvements in the living standard had enabled the Chinese 
people to bear, both economically and psychologically, possible 
pain brought about by reform, he said. 
  "If we fail to overcome difficulties in the economic 
restructuring in the next few years and well solve all kinds of 
problems that will crop up on way of development, we might delay 
the proceeding of the modernization of our nation and miss a 
historical opportunity of enlivening the nation and making the 
state powerful," he said. 
  He said he was confident that China would manage to tide 
over 
the hardship in the years to come. He predicted that China 
would establish a socialist market economy by the end of 1996. 
  The Chinese reform, which he called "a great, new 
century-oriented reform project," would promote the economic 
prosperity and social stability not only in China, but also in 
East Asia and the Asia-Pacific region, he said. 
  The prospect for China's economic growth would remain bright 
because the Chinese Government would never weaken its 
determination to build up the nation and improve the living 
standard of the people, Zhu said in conclusion.

  [Text] Beijing, February 22 (CNS)--With the continuously 
deepening of political, economic and cultural exchanges between 
China and Japan, foreign trade between the two countries has 
been developing in an unprecedented way. According to 
statistics from customs, last year saw a Sino-Japanese trade 
value of U.S.$39 billion, 53.9 percent up over the year before, 
enabling the country to surpass Hong Kong and become the biggest 
trade partner of China. 
  According to statistics, China's exports to Japan last year 
was valued at U.S.$15.78 billion, 35.1 percent up with the main 
export commodities being garments, footwear, textile products, 
toys, video recorders, Hi Fi sets and plastic products. China's 
imports from Japan were valued at U.S.$23.25 billion, 70 percent 
up, contributing to an unfavorable balance of U.S.$7.44 billion. 
The imports were mainly steel products, cars, machinery 
equipment of various kinds, processing machine tools, integrated 
circuits, micro-electrical parts, telephones and telegraphic 
equipment. 
  From 1983 to 1993, Sino-Japanese trade grew by 14.6 percent 
on average annually. Trade between the two countries is mainly 
focused on general trade with the export value earned from 
general trade last year reaching U.S.$9 billion and the import 
value U.S.$8.24 billion while the processing trade between the 
two sides has been developing very rapidly with the export value 
from this sector amounting to U.S.$6.71 billion and the import 
value U.S.$8.22 billion.

  [Text] Beijing, 23 Feb (XINHUA) -- While meeting with Nong 
Duc Manh, chairman of the National Assembly of Vietnam, this 
morning at Zhongnanhai, President Jiang Zemin expressed the 
belief that the China-Vietnam good-neighborly, friendly, and 
mutually cooperative relationship will surely keep on developing 
on the basis of the five principles of peaceful co-existence. 
  The Nong Duc Manh-led Vietnamese National Assembly 
delegation 
is the first delegation of Vietnam's National Assembly to visit 
China since the normalization of diplomatic relations between 
China and Vietnam. Jiang Zemin welcomed the visit of Nong Duc 
Manh and his party. 
  Jiang Zemin said that the Sino-Vietnamese relationship has 
seen great development in recent years and that there have been 
frequent high-level exchanges between the two countries. During 
the recent visit of Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh to China, 
both sides exchanged views on bilateral relations and on 
international and regional issues and reached common 
understanding over many major issues. 
  Jiang Zemin added that further consolidation and enhancement 
of the good-neighborly, friendly, and mutually cooperative 
relationship is not only in accord with the fundamental 
interests of the two countries and peoples, but also will be 
conducive to peace, stability, and development in the region. 
  During the meeting, Nong Duc Manh briefed Jiang Zemin on 
Vietnam's socio-economic development. He said as Vietnam is 
implementing the policy of reform and opening up, Vietnam can 
borrow from China's many successful experiences in the areas of 
reform and opening up. 
  Jiang Zemin also gave a short briefing to the Vietnamese 
guests on China's reform, opening up, and on building a 
socialist market economy. 
  During the meeting, Nong Duc Manh conveyed greetings to 
President Jiang Zemin from Do Muoi, general secretary of the 
Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee; President Le Duc 
Anh; and Premier Vo Van Kiet. Jiang Zemin asked Nong Duc Manh 
to convey his greetings to General Secretary Do Muoi, President 
Le Duc Anh, and Premier Vo Van Kiet. 
  Wang Hanbin, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the 
National People's Congress, was present at the meeting.

  [Text] Guangzhou, February 18 (CNS)--The Guangdong 
Department of Public Security successfully cracked a big 
drug-trafficking ring composed of drug traffickers from Hong 
Kong, Guangdong, Yunnan and Guangxi with the arrest of 26 
suspects including three Hong Kong persons, seizing 17,400 grams 
of heroin, RMB [renminbi] 1.2 million in cash and a number of 
instruments for the processing of drugs. 
  Police in Zhaoqing carried out an undercover action on 
November 2 last year after learning that drug traffickers from 
Hong Kong had gone there with a big amount of money for trading 
drugs with a local drug-dealer at his luxury residence. The 
police launched a raid on the drug-traffickers early the 
following early morning when the four suspects appeared outside 
the house carrying bulging bags. They were arrested and 7,500 
grams of heroin were found in the bags. The police also 
captured three other suspects inside the house and discovered 
RMB 620,000 in cash which had been brought there by the Hong 
Kong suspects as well as 8,700 grams of heroin. 
  The police went on the same day to arrest two other suspects 
who had sneaked into Shenzhen from Hong Kong and were found to 
be accomplices in the drug-trafficking. Two more hideouts for 
the drug trade were smashed in the urban area of Zhaoqing with 
five drug-traffickers arrested. 
  Further raids were later carried out in Yunnan, Guangxi and 
Luoding in Guangdong with the ring-leader together with six 
suspects being captured. The drug ring was wiped out with the 
elimination of the drug route by which the drugs were first 
brought in from Yunnan and transported to Zhaoqing in Guangdong 
via Guangxi for later shipment to Hong Kong drug dealers.

  [Text] Hong Kong, 17 Feb (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Shenzhen 
Vice Mayor Li Chuanfang said on a public occasion in Hong Kong 
this morning that the Sino-British row on Hong Kong's 
constitutional affairs will not affect British consortia's 
bidding for economic projects in Shenzhen. 
  Li Chuanfang said that to further improve transportation 
facilities and meet the need of economic development, Shenzhen 
has thoroughly begun preparation for building a subway system. 
Because the subway system is a huge project which needs a large 
amount of funds and technology, Shenzhen City Government 
welcomes domestic and overseas consortia in bidding for the 
projects of the subway. 
  A reporter asked whether the Sino-British row over Hong 
Kong's constitutional affairs will affect British firms' bids 
for those projects. 
  Li Chuanfang said that Shenzhen City Government will give 
equal treatment to domestic and overseas consortia which are 
interested in bidding for those as well as other construction 
projects. She said that as far as she understands, economic and 
political issues cannot be lumped together for discussion, and 
that so long as the consortia meet the bidding requirements, 
they may win the tenders.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Depressed Man Who Failed to Buy Train </F>
Ticket Ignited Grenade in Nanning Railway Station, Injuring 24 
Persons"] 
  [Text] After the recent tragedy in Hunan's Hengyang 
Railway Station, in which several dozen workers were trampled to 
death as a result of overcrowding, Guangxi's Nanning Railway 
Station, another transit point for the tides of job seekers in 
the southwest, witnessed a grenade explosion which injured 24 
persons. 
  A senior government official from the Guangxi Autonomous 
Region told this newspaper that the explosion took place at 8:35 
yesterday morning in the rain shelter outside Nanning Railway 
Station, and that the man involved was Liu Yong, a 44-year old 
native of Jiangsu. He wanted to buy a ticket to return to 
Jiangsu that day but failed to get one and thus became 
depressed. With the very crowded conditions of Nanning Railway 
Station, he became very annoyed, subsequently "lost control of 
his faculties," and ignited a grenade which he had been carrying 
with him, injuring 23 individuals and himself. 
  A witness on the scene, Wei Yanhua, a cleaning woman working 
for the train station, was quoted as saying that, before the 
explosion, she saw Liu Yong take a rusty grenade out of his 
brown bag and begin to play with it, and she approached him to 
ask him to stop. Liu Yong said that it was only a toy and would 
not explode. As Wei Yanhua was on her way to report the case to 
the police, the grenade exploded. 
  According to the Nanning police, they still have no idea as 
to where Liu Yong got the grenade. Liu Yong himself was hurt 
rather seriously but all the others suffered only minor or 
slight injuries. 
  Nanning police said that Liu Yong was a "person who had 
sneaked in from outside," who "might suffered from mental 
illness." 
  The senior official from the Guangxi Autonomous Region 
Government said that, after the incident took place, the Liuzhou 
Railway Station Public Security Department and the relevant 
departments of Guangxi Region and Nanning City have already 
strengthened the measures to divert passengers in the big 
railway stations such as Nanning and Liuzhou. At present, 
Liuzhou and Nanning Railway Stations are very crowded. These 
railways are the only travel option for the "Sichuan army," 
"Guizhou army," and "Yunnan army" as they flock to Guangdong and 
Guangxi to "work." 
  More than 10,000 passengers currently depart from Nanning 
Railway Station every day. In addition, the regional 
transportation department organizes buses to help divert the 
passengers. 
  The senior official said that, since the spring festival, 
passenger trains coming in and out of Guangxi have been 
seriously overloaded. A great number of workers have traveled a 
great distance, and compartments which according to the 
regulations can only accommodate 200 people have often squeezed 
in 500-600. This has made the air inside the compartment very 
dirty, to the extent that some passengers have became distraught 
and some have even jumped out of the train in order to breathe. 
(According to statistics, from 1 to 6 February, 19 passengers in 
Guangxi became distraught, three passengers died, one passenger 
was injured, and five passengers disappeared. It is believed 
that the number of passengers who became distraught at other 
times but failed to be counted would exceed this number.) 
  This leading official also said that they have heard nothing 
about the tragedy in Hunan's Hengyang Railway Station, in which 
people were trampled to death on the sixth day of the Lunar New 
Year, and that they have not received any circulars from the 
relevant quarter.

  [Text] Prior to his presence at the Second Session of the 
Eighth Provincial People's Congress this afternoon, Governor Zhu 
Senlin told reporters that Guangdong will build a second nuclear 
power station in the Daya Bay. Zhu Senlin said: The 
first-phase project of the Daya Bay nuclear power station has 
been completed; the second nuclear power station possibly may 
comprise four generating units. In addition, a third nuclear 
power station possibly will be built in Yangjiang, which will 
comprise four to six generating units. The Daya Bay and 
Yangjiang nuclear power stations will have an installed capacity 
of almost 10 million kilowatts. 
  Zhu Senlin also explicitly explained the safety of the Daya 
Bay nuclear power station -- a question asked by a Hong Kong 
reporter. He said: There is a full set of emergency measures 
within the radius of five to 50 km of the Daya Bay nuclear power 
station. These measures are quite perfect and everyone may rest 
assured.

<F P=106> [By Daniel Kwan in Guangzhou and Elisabeth Tacey] </F>
  [Text] Guangdong Governor Zhu Senlin confirmed yesterday 
that at least two more nuclear power plants, much bigger than 
the existing station at Daya Bay, would be built to meet the 
province's electricity demand. The Government had already 
decided to add four more reactors at Daya Bay, Mr Zhu said 
before a session of the Guangdong People's Congress. "Yes. 
That's right. The second nuclear plant will be at Daya Bay," 
he said. The third, which will have six generating units will 
be at Yangjiang City 226 kilometres west of Hong Kong. Each 
generator will produce 1,000 megawatts. "We would like to build 
more according to our plans, but it is still difficult to say 
when we will build the fourth and the fifth." 
  It is believed Guangdong wants the second Daya Bay station, 
to be built about five kilometres away at the village of Lingao, 
to come on stream within four years. Confirmation of many more 
nuclear facilities so close to Hong Kong could deal a severe 
blow to confidence in the territory where many people still have 
doubts over the safety of the first reactors, which went into 
operation last month. Hong Kong's environmentalists and 
legislators fear poorer safety standards and cost-cutting will 
make the new power plants more dangerous than the existing Daya 
Bay plant. Although Daya Bay has already started operation, the 
Hong Kong Government still had difficulties reaching a full 
agreement with Guangdong on how to deal with nuclear accidents. 
  It was understood that Prime Minister Li Peng had given his 
consent to the construction of the second plant at Daya Bay. 
Each reactor will have a power generation capacity of 900 
megawatts. Liang Zhenyuan, party secretary of Yangjiang, 
confirmed that road construction and site surveys for the third 
nuclear plant had been completed. The mayor of Yangjiang city, 
Wen Paotian, said the plant would cost about 100 billion yuan 
(HK$88.8 billion) and would be financed mainly by foreign 
investment. Mr Liang insisted nuclear plants built in China 
would be safe as did Mr Zhu. "There is no need to worry about 
safety. We have very secure safety measures. Many Hong Kong 
representatives have visited (Daya Bay)," Mr Zhu said. "We have 
a very comprehensive set of safety measures for areas located 
five or 30 km from the Daya Bay nuclear plant. "On this point, 
put your heart at ease," he said. 
  Executive Vice-Governor Lu Ruihua confirmed Guangdong was 
awaiting final approval from Beijing for the expansion of 
nuclear generation facilities. Mr Lu said nuclear energy was 
preferred because it was "pollution free". "We still have a 
power shortage even if we add all our existing energy resources 
together," he said. The nuclear plants would be financed by the 
Central and provincial governments. When asked whether 
Guangdong would consider foreign investment, Mr Lu said: "We 
will make that decision when the time comes." 
  However, Legislative Councillor the Reverend Fung Chi-wood 
said the Chinese Government decided in its 1980s feasibility 
study that Lingao, five kilometres northeast of Daya Bay and 
about 55 km from Hong Kong, was a less suitable site than Daya 
Bay for a nuclear plant because it was more prone to 
earthquakes. Because Hong Kong is unlikely to need any 
electricity from the plant after the Black Point power station 
comes on line, the territory's companies might be less 
interested in playing a role. Daya Bay provides 70 per cent of 
its output to Hong Kong. China Light and Power which owns 25 
per cent of the Daya Bay plant through its subsidiary Hong Kong 
Nuclear Investment Co, said that it had yet to consider becoming 
involved. But spokesman Dominic Tai Kwan-kuen said that "the 
theory is correct" that the company's interest might be reduced 
because it would not want to buy the electricity. 
  Mr Fung and colleague Emily Lau Wai-hing said they thought 
China would try to use the little knowledge learned from the 
Daya Bay plant to cut out foreign firms. Ms Lau said that 
considering how jittery Hong Kong people were about Daya Bay: 
"Why can't they build it somewhere else; why do they need to 
provoke the situation?" But Ms Lau and Christine Loh Kung-wai 
cautioned against trying to tell the Chinese what to do. It was 
none of Hong Kong's business where the mainland chose to build 
its power plants. 
  Friends of the Earth representative Lisa Hopkinson said it 
was "the height of foolhardiness" to go ahead with another plant 
before any disposal programme had been worked out for the waste 
that would be generated. She also said the probability of 
accidents increased with the number of plants built. And 
without any idea how to decommission old plants, China was 
building up a huge liability for the future.

<F P=106> [By Sun Shangwu: "Satellite Land Station Launched"] </F>
  [Text] A new satellite earth station was put into official 
operation in Beijing's northwest suburbs yesterday. 
  It is designed to provide mobile communications links 
between 
ships on the Indian and Pacific oceans and people on any 
continent. 
  The Beijing Marine Communication and Navigation Company a 
member of the International Maritime Satellite Organization 
(Inmarsat), has invested in the station. 
  The Beijing Inmarsat station which started trials in June 
1991 was set up with $2.44 million in loans from the Norwegian 
Government. 
  During the trials, the station helped customers at sea to 
put 
through domestic and international telephone calls, faxes and 
telexes. 
  The station can also provide help with news reporting and 
geological prospecting and has commercial and safety 
applications on land sea and air. 
  Inmarsat is based in London and was founded in 1979 to serve 
the maritime community. China was one of the first members.

  [Text] A foreign tourist illegally carrying more than 120 
grams of marijuana was arrested at the Shoudu Airport's security 
inspection station. This is the first time that the station has 
cracked a case of a passenger carrying marijuana. 
  At about 1930 on 28 January, when this passenger was 
receiving the security inspection, the exit alarm bell went off. 
Li Jianhua, an inspector at the second section of the security 
inspection, found that the cigarette cases that the passenger 
carried were full of a solid yellow material and another 
cigarette case had six cigarettes without tobacco inside. 
Through the laboratory test, the customhouse maintained that 
the solid yellow substance is marijuana. 
  This passenger is from Canada and his name is Bhagg. He is a 
foreign teacher at a certain institute in Beijing. He carried 
the marijuana and attempted to take it himself. 
  On 1719 on 31 January, the security inspection station of 
the 
Shoudu International airport discovered another passenger 
illegally carrying marijuana. 
  The alarm went off when the passenger went through the 
international personal safety inspection section. Inspector 
Gong Fanying found 20 grams of marijuana in his socks. This 
passenger was from Xinjiang. He planned to take flight No. TK 
753 on the same evening to Turkey via Pakistan. It was reported 
that this is the fourth case [as published] of illegal 
possession of narcotics discovered at the security inspection 
station of the Shoudu International Airport.

  [Text] Beijing, February 23 (CNS) -- The total number of 
labourers pouring into Beijing from elsewhere in the country is 
close to one million and Beijing Railway Station is seeing 
60,000 to 70,000 of them arriving from all directions every day 
in recent times, according to the municipal public security 
bureau. 
  As long ago as 1986, a large number of labourers from 25 
provinces and cities in China began pouring into the capital in 
search of work in such industries as construction, environmental 
work and coal. Of the 1.5 million [figure as received] 
labourers coming from elsewhere, nearly one million of them live 
in the capital on a more or less permanent basis. Some 800,000 
of them are engaged in various kinds of economic activities with 
300,000 of them working in construction on such projects as the 
construction of buildings, 81 flyovers and 3,000 kilometres of 
roads. Such labourers from outside the capital are also engaged 
in production, processing and repair services. 
  Apart from those engaged in the urban area, there are yet 
another 200,000 of them in the suburban areas engaged in 
agriculture, hand-finished products and domestic service.

  [Text] Beijing, February 21 (CNS)--There has been a drop 
in the number of Beijing students of college-level and above 
going abroad to study at their own expense with 2,800 of them 
being approved last year down by 1,063 last year from the number 
in 1992 and by 2,031 from the number in 1991, according to the 
municipal Higher Education Bureau. 
  One of the reasons for this fall is the deepeening of reform 
and the widening of opening to the outside world which has lead 
to a number of students seeing their ability to earn money in 
the Mainland and chances to fully exploit their talents there. 
In past years, some people felt that there was no role for them 
in the Mainland and that intellectuals were not adequately 
rewarded. Going abroad, therefore, was seen as a way out of 
this situation. Now, many people originally planning to go 
abroad question why they need to do so since there are now ways 
to employ their talents at home. 
  Another reason for the drop is the increasing rise of 
expenses involved in going abroad to study and the difficulties 
faced by foreign countries in taking so many Chinese students. 
Some of the foreign countries which in the past had taken in 
many Chinese students have now adopted restrictive measures in 
light of depressed economies and social problems. 
  Despite the fall in the number of students going abroad at 
their own expense, students with post-graduate qualifications 
constituted 27 percent of such students. In 1993, however, the 
ratio increased to 36 percent and in the first half of last 
year, among the students going abroad from Beijing University, 
Qinghua University and the Beijing Medical Sciences University, 
those with post-graduate qualifications made up over 40 percent.

delivered to all homes in the capital, and about three million 
Beijing citizens can read their daily newspaper one or two hours 
earlier than the previous year. 
  That is part of the achievements of the Beijing Postal 
Administration last year. Officials said that Beijing's postal 
services were greatly updated during 1993. 
  Eight new post offices were built and another 23 enlarged 
and 
renovated, expanding the number of post offices to 447. 
  In addition, an in-city express mail service, an instant 
telegraph service and a system of ordering newspapers by 
telephone were all added to the list of services available in 
Beijing. 
  Registered mail has been able to reach Taiwan since last 
year 
after years of trying to arrange this. 
  Officials said that fixed assets investment totalled 260 
million yuan last year in such projects as a postal hub capable 
of handling 110,000 pieces of mail each day, which was completed 
last year. 
  Zhou Huan, director of the Beijing Postal Bureau, told 
XINHUA 
that this year Beijing will build more postal outlets and other 
working sites with government funds and capital scheduled to be 
imported from abroad.

  [Text] Beijing, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Beijing has made 
much headway in reform of the housing system, on the basis of a 
four-year experiment. 
  The reform, begun in 1988, involves millions of citizens in 
the capital, including people in government departments and army 
units here. 
  The reform includes housing funds collection both by the 
government and work units, setting up accumulation funds by 
employees, raising house rents, putting houses on sale, and 
building houses with cooperative funds. 
  Its main aim is to step up commercialization of housing. 
  By the end of 1993, this capital city had sold 150,000 
apartments with floor space of 9 million square [sq] meters. 
Some 100,000 of these were sold last year -- four times more 
than the total of the previous four years. 
  The city has received 1.7 billion yuan (about 200 million 
U.S. dollars) in all from the sales. 
  It has also reaped 400 million yuan (about 47 million U.S. 
dollars) from raising house rents, some 120 million yuan (over 
14 million U.S. dollars) of this increases being received in 
1993. 
  The rent of houses is usually raised by over 0.4 yuan per 
square meter per month, or 0.55 yuan per sq m. in suburbs and 
one yuan per sq m. for new houses. 
  In addition, 1.5 million people in Beijing have joined a 
housing accumulation fund which has collected 80 million yuan 
(nearly 10 million U.S. dollars). 
  The city plans to further expand the housing reform in the 
fields of establishment of housing accumulation funds, house 
sales and rent raising in line with the cost of house building 
and increases of people's incomes.

  [Text] Beijing, February 23 (XINHUA) -- China's capital has 
for the first time more public-run cultural and performing art 
troupes than governmental ones, according to officials of the 
municipality. 
  By the end of last year the number of nongovernmental 
cultural and art troupes in Beijing exceeded 20. 
  The nongovernmental troupes are run by diverse entities, 
ranging from state industrial enterprises, institutions, 
collective troupes and individual actors and actresses. 
  Such cultural and art troupes, staffed by 30 to 60 people 
each, specialize in different art forms, such as music, dance, 
opera and folk arts. 
  Three of the major enterprises that manage cultural and art 
troupes of their own are the Capital Iron and Steel Corporation, 
Beijing Yanshan Petrochemicals Corporation and Beijing 
International Art and Literature, a culture and art-oriented 
enterprise. 
  Such enterprise-run cultural and art troupes, known for 
their 
flexible management system, have appeal for graduates of art 
schools as well as noted actors and actresses such as Hu 
Xiaoqin, Yang Jiuhong and Zhang Zhenfu. 
  The new types of cultural and art troupes, by exercising 
self-autonomy, have cut to the minimum red tape and rigidity in 
management, which plague government-run cultural and art troupes. 
  Meanwhile there has emerged a surge of marriages between 
enterprises and cultural and art troupes, the two parties 
sharing equally profits and losses. 
  An official from the local culture bureau said that that the 
public-run cultural and art troupes have ended the state 
monopoly in this sphere and will help enrich the cultural life 
of the capital, as the practice better taps the initiative and 
creativeness of the public. 
  But he also said that the overall artistic level of the 
nongovernmental cultural and art troupes is still inferior to 
that of those run by the government.

  [Text] Shijiazhuang, February 22 (XINHUA) -- Water from the 
Yellow River [Huang He] is now flowing into Cangzhou and 
Hengshui cities in the thirsty North China province of Hebei. 
  This is part of the water diversion project to quench the 
thirst of industries and agriculture in this water short 
province. 
  According to the decision by the State Council, pending the 
water diversion project from Chang Jiang, an estimated 500 
million cubic meters of Yellow River water would be diverted to 
Hebei for the next 15 years. 
  To date, the project has progressed smoothly. More than 100 
million cu m of water have been diverted from the Yellow River 
into the cities of Cangzhou and Hengshui on the vast "North 
China" plain. 
  The water diversion project was proposed jointly by the 
Ministry of Water Resources of China and the provincial 
governments of Hebei and Shandong. 
  Seriously suffering from water shortages, most of the 
farmland on the plain averages an output of only slightly more 
than 1,500 kg of wheat per ha. 
  Moreover, the over-exploitation of groundwater resources has 
lowered the water quality and has seriously hindered the 
development of both industry and agriculture. 
  Ye Liansong, governor of hebei, pointed out that the water 
diversion project from the Yellow River to Hebei could yet not 
solve the problem thoroughly, as the rate of flow of the Yellow 
River has decreased year-by-year. 
  He said that the only way to supply enough water for arid 
Hebei is to divert water from the lower reaches of the Chang 
Jiang River.

<F P=106> [By Li Guirong (2621 2710 2837): "Our Region Achieved Great </F>
Progress in Last Year's Reform, Opening Up, and Economic 
Construction"] 
  [Text] Reporter learned from the new briefing held by the 
regional government on 25 January that last year our region 
persisted in regarding economic construction as the central 
task, conscientiously implemented the central authorities' 
series of major policy decisions and plans on strengthening and 
improving macroeconomic regulation and control, seized the 
opportunity to deepen reform and accelerate development, and 
achieved major progress in reform, opening up, and economic 
construction. 
  In 1993, the major characteristics in our region's national 
economic development were: 
  1. The total social supply increased comprehensively, and 
the 
primary, secondary, and tertiary industries steadily developed. 
According to initial estimates, the gross domestic product of 
the whole year was valued at 45.516 billion yuan (calculated in 
terms of the prices of that year and the rate is calculated in 
terms of constant prices, similarly hereafter), up 10.6 percent 
over the previous year, of which, the increased value of the 
primary industry may reach 14.77 billion yuan, up 5 percent over 
the previous year, and the rate of increase was quicker than the 
national average by 1.3 percentage point; the increased value of 
the secondary industry may reach 18.8 billion yuan, up 16.4 
percent over the previous year; and the increased value of the 
tertiary industry may reach 11.946 billion yuan, up 9.7 percent 
over the previous year. A bumper agricultural harvest was 
reaped despite the year of serious disasters, the total output 
value of agriculture amounted to 19.5 billion yuan, up 6 percent 
over the previous year, and the total grain output registered an 
all-time record to reach 11.08 billion kg, up 5.9 percent over 
the bumper harvest year of 1992; the total number of livestock 
during the year was 55.777 million, the highest record in 
history, and the number of livestock in stock at the end of the 
year reached 42.47 million, an increase of 786,000 over the 
year-end figure of the previous year. Fairly rapid increases 
were made in industrial production, with the total industrial 
output value reaching 50.5 billion yuan, up 12.78 percent over 
the previous year, and the production of the nonstate industrial 
sector, in particular, developed speedily and increased by 26.64 
percent over the previous year, which was quicker than the rate 
of increase of the state-owned industrial sector by 21.8 percent. 
  2. Social demands increased rapidly, particularly investment 
demands increased speedily, and consumer demands were steady and 
active. Based on initial statistics, the region's total 
investments in fixed assets amounted to 21.056 billion yuan, up 
41.09 percent over the previous year. Of these investments, 
13.136 billion yuan were used for state-owned capital 
construction projects, up 43.83 percent, and 4.107 billion yuan 
were for equipment replacement and technical updating, up 58.33 
percent, all setting the best record in history. The domestic 
markets were stable and invigorated. The annual retail sales of 
commodities in society totaled 21.968 billion yuan, up 17.5 
percent over the previous year. Of this, the retail sales of 
consumer goods increased 19.56 percent. 
  3. Foreign economic relations were further expanded and the 
use of foreign capital increased by 100 percent. Based on 
initial statistics, the whole region's volume of foreign import 
and export trades totalled $1.2 billion, up 28.29 percent over 
the previous year, an all-time record. Of this, the volume of 
imports totalled $550 million, up 59.42 percent; and the volume 
of exports totalled $650 million, up 9.95 percent. Newly 
registered "three types of foreign-funded enterprises" numbered 
416, an increase of 1.25 percent over the previous year. 
  4. Financial revenue rapidly increased and the financial 
order improved noticeably. The whole region's 1993 financial 
revenue from the localities is expected to reach 5.5 billion 
yuan, up 41.02 percent; and financial expenditures, 8.76 billion 
yuan, an increase of 21.6 percent over the previous year, shows 
that the growth of financial revenue is quicker than the growth 
of financial expenditures by 19.42 percent. Financial order 
improved noticeably, the phenomenon of arbitrarily collecting 
unwarranted funds and lending loans was checked, and the total 
urban and rural savings deposits amounted to 23.214 billion 
yuan, up 29.64 percent over the previous year. 
  5. The incomes of urban and rural residents steadily 
increased, and their living standards were further enhanced. 
Based on initial statistics, the total payroll of workers across 
the region in 1993 amounted to 10.971 billion yuan, up 21.34 
percent over the previous year. Of this, the wages of workers 
of state-owned units increased 22.76 percent. The average wage 
of workers was 2,772 yuan, an increase of 19.59 percent over the 
previous year. The average per-capita income for living 
expenses of urban residents throughout the region was 1,712 
yuan, up 27.3 percent over the previous year. After price 
factors were deducted, the actual increase was 11.6 percent. 
The average per-capita net income of peasants and herdsmen 
reached 829.1 percent, up 15.3 percent. When the price 
increases were factored in, the actual increase was 3.6 percent. 
Of this, the average per-capita net income of peasants was 
777.9 yuan, up 15.7 percent; showing an actual increase of 3.8 
percent when the price factors were excluded; and that of 
herdsmen, 1,164.1 yuan, up 13.9 percent, showing an actual 
increase of 3 percent when the price factors were deducted. 
  6. Definite achievements were made in family planning work, 
and population growth was effectively brought under control. 
Based on calculations made in the sample survey on the changes 
in population, the whole region's birth rate in 1993 was 18.48 
per thousand, the mortality rate was 6.83 per thousand, the 
natural population growth rate was 11.65 per thousand, and the 
region's year-end population figure was 22,324,100, an increase 
of 258,600 people, or 1.17 percent, over the year-end figure of 
the previous year. 
  In 1993, our region's economic situation was good on the 
whole. However, prominent problems still existed in the economic 
life, which were mainly manifested in the economic development 
gap between our region and the whole country and the existing 
problems, namely, the shortage of funds, the management 
difficulties of enterprises, poor economic efficiency, 
irrational structure, and the high commodity prices on the 
market.

<F P=106> [By reporter Wang Dongmei (3769 0392 2734) and correspondent </F>
Wang Yongping (3769 3057 1627): "Resolutely Try Major and 
Appalling Cases and Actually Safeguard Social Stability"] 
  [Text] For now and the foreseeable future, people's courts 
at all levels in the region should consciously uphold the 
principle of "taking a two-handed approach and being tough with 
both hands" and actually safeguard social stability in order to 
provide an effective legal guarantee for accelerating the 
region's reform and opening up. This was stressed by Qian 
Fenyong, deputy secretary of the regional party committee, at 
the 24 January regional meeting of presidents of intermediate 
people's courts. 
  The fundamental tasks on the judicial work of people's 
courts 
in 1994 are: Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee, people's courts should continue to deal 
strict blows to criminal offenses, make greater efforts to try 
major and appalling cases, particularly major economic cases, 
energetically regulate the relations between different economic 
sectors, actually safeguard the legitimate rights and interests 
of citizens, legal entities, and other organizations, strict 
enforce laws, enhance the level of judicial work, help safeguard 
social stability, help strengthen administrative honesty, and 
help accelerate the establishment of the socialist market 
economic structure. 
  Qian Fenyong said in his speech: This year, reform, opening 
up, and economic construction will enter a new stage of 
all-round acceleration. The more reform and opening up is 
deepened, the faster the economy will develop, and the more 
important the endeavor of safeguarding social stability will 
become. Establishing the socialist market economic structure 
constitutes a large-scale readjustment of economic interests in 
the whole society. Along with the increase in the dynamics of 
reform, some new contradictions and problems will emerge, and 
the factors affecting social stability will probably increase in 
a certain period. To successfully safeguard social stability, 
people's courts must successfully exploit all their functions of 
dealing blows to crimes, regulating the relations between 
different sectors of the economy, and protecting the legitimate 
rights and interests of the people. In the course of dealing 
strict blows to crimes, people's courts at all levels should 
make greater efforts to try economic cases, civil cases, 
administrative cases, accusations, and appeals and should 
consciously apply the legal means to standardize market 
behaviors, to regulate the relations between different sectors 
of the economy, and to appropriately tackle all sorts of 
contradictions in society. People's courts should successfully 
safeguard social stability in basic and essential fields. 
  He said: Success or failure in the anticorruption campaign 
has a direct bearing on the success or failure in building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. For now and and in the 
foreseeable future, a number of lawsuits on major and appalling 
economic cases are and will soon be soon brought to people's 
courts for lawsuit. Successfully trying these cases and strictly 
punishing a number of corrupt elements according to the law 
constitutes an important sign of the in-depth launching of the 
region's anticorruption campaign as well as a hot spot closely 
related to the masses. People's courts at all levels must now 
pay attention to trying economic cases, major and appalling ones 
in particular, by regarding it as a key task. Moreover, major 
and appalling cases which have strong repercussions in society 
and which concern the masses must be handled and punished 
resolutely, no matter what interferences arise. 
  Attending the meeting were Wang Xiumei, vice chairman of the 
regional people's congress standing committee; Yun Bulong, vice 
chairman of the region; and other pertinent leaders.

  [Summary] On 17 January, the Baotou city intermediate court 
held a rally to publicly sentence Zhang Wu and Deng Cunjun to 
death according to the laws. Major thefts were perpetrated by 
Zhang Wu, Zhao Waixin, and Wang Sheng, who used to be laborers 
at the Communist Youth farm of Baotou city's suburban district. 
From October 1992 to February 1993, they successively hired 
small four-wheeled tractors to steal 53.23 tons of steel 
products, such as square steel and skelp, from the seamless 
steel tube plant under Baotou Iron and Steel Company. The value 
of these stolen goods totaled 114,600 yuan. They earned more 
than 87,990 yuan from selling the stolen goods. 
  Deng Cunyun, Yao Guangli, and Li Aijun, identified as 
robbers 
and murderers, ganged up with one another in Datong of Shanxi 
Province. They took a taxi run by with a driver near the No. 3 
hospital of Datong city on 29 April 1993. They caught the 
driver off guard, strangled him with a nylon rope, killed him, 
and robbed him of 1,550 yuan in cash and other items. They also 
pushed the taxi with the corpse inside into a hole, poured 
petroleum on it, and burned it down. On 26 September, they fled 
to Baotou city. They murdered a taxi driver in front of Golden 
Eagle Hotel at the city's Kun District. They robbed the taxi 
driver 150 yuan in cash and some other items. They threw the 
corpse in a fruit garden and ran away. 
  The Baotou city intermediate court sentenced them to death 
after the first ruling. The second ruling by the regional 
higher court dismissed the appeals filed by the defendants and 
upheld the decision of the original trial. Zhang Wu, Zhao 
Waixin, Wang Sheng Deng Cunjun, and Yao Guangli were executed on 
the morning of 17 January.

  [Text] The Hohhot City Intermediate People's Court held an 
open trial on 26 January sentencing Liu Jianjun, a thief, and 
Cao Yukuan, intentional murderer, to death according to law. 
  Liu Jianjun, Wang Wenzhi, Li Wansen, Li Suanlao, Gao 
Baguang, 
and Yang Heping, who were guilty of stealing, are all peasants. 
From August 1989 to April 1990, these persons committed crimes 
alone or in a group on 54 occasions. They broke into the 
warehouses of 47 residences, taking seven motorcycles, seven 
bicycles, and a large quantity of articles for daily use, 
including sheep, flour, rice, and clothes, totaling over 52,900 
yuan. Of these cases, 45 cases were committed by Liu Jianjun 
independently or jointly, and stolen money and property came to 
a total of 51,100 yuan. 
  Cao Yukuan, who committed intentional murder, was a 
temporary 
worker at the Hohhot City Construction Engineering Corporation. 
On the night of 19 July 1993, Cao Yukuan, in collusion with 
another criminal, Guo Yongdong, attempted to seek revenge by 
killing the manager of the corporation, named Shi. Carrying 
military bayonets, these two criminals went to Manager Shi's 
house. Seeing that Manager Shi was not at home, they broke into 
the warehouse to stab the daughter to death, with over 10 stabs 
to her chest, stomach, and legs. They also stabbed and wounded 
Shi's wife named Guo and a neighbor by the name of Shi, who 
rushed to the scene to save Shi's daughter after hearing her 
cries for help. 
  Upon pronouncement of the court decision in the first ruling 
of the Hohhot City Intermediate People's Court, the accused 
refused to accept the referee's ruling and lodged an appeal. In 
the second ruling by the regional higher people's court, the 
appeal was rejected, and the first court's decision was upheld. 
  An additional 22 criminals were respectively sentenced on 26 
January to death with a two-year reprieve or to life 
imprisonment.

  [Text] Taiyuan, February 24 (XINHUA) -- The rampant spread 
of endemic diseases in north China's Shanxi Province has now 
been brought under control thanks to the joint efforts of the 
local government and people. 
  The province is one of those blighted by a high incidence of 
endemic diseases such as Kaschin-Beck, Keshan, undulant fever, 
fluorine poisoning and iodine deficiency. 
  A recent survey conducted by the provincial endemic disease 
prevention and cure group shows that out of 118 cities and 
counties of the province, 107 suffer from such diseases and that 
in some counties the incidence of endemic disease has picked up 
sharply over the past few years. 
  It also shows that in Heshong and Qinyuan counties, the 
number of patients suffering from iodine deficiency, gas 
fluorine poisoning and Kaschin-Beck disease reached 120,000, 
accounting for 42 percent of the total population of these 
counties. 
  Analysts here attribute local poverty and economic 
underdevelopment partly to the spread of endemic diseases. Over 
30 percent of poor families had fallen on hard times due to 
chronic diseases, endemic diseases in particular. 
  Analysts say that endemic diseases here mainly attack the 
bones, joints and hearts of children and women of child-bearing 
age. 
  The survey indicates that among 2,853 primary and high 
school 
students in Heshong county who took physical examinations, the 
incidence of goiter was as high as 23.87 percent. 
  And in one village, some 8.8 percent of school-age children 
were deprived of going to school and 9.4 percent of primary 
school students were unable to graduate due to mental 
retardation caused by Keshan disease. 
  Figures show that of 7,172 children aged between seven and 
14 
in 24 counties heavily hit by undulant fever, the incidence rate 
of goiter due to iodine deficiency amounted to 32.94 percent. 
  Despite efforts to improve drinking water quality and 
heating 
facilities in the province, about two million people still live 
in high gas and fluorine poisoning areas. 
  The provincial government and party committee have paid ever 
closer attention to the prevention and control of endemic 
diseases and a range of forceful measures have been adopted 
since last year. 
  The move aims to curb the further spread of the diseases and 
bring the incidence rate under control at a level stipulated by 
the state. 
  Prevention and cure of endemic diseases has now been focused 
on strengthening the leadership and active participation of the 
whole society, according to local officials. 
  In May 1993, a provincial conference on controlling endemic 
diseases was called, and relevant rules and regulations were 
framed to reduce transmissions of the diseases among local 
people. 
  The leading bodies and offices in charge of prevention and 
cure of endemic diseases have now been reorganized in 11 
prefectures and cities, and a sound responsibility system has 
also been set up. 
  The local government at the same time has set aside hundreds 
of millions of yuan to boost the fight against endemic diseases 
from the beginning of 1994. 
  Starting from 1994, it will add one million yuan each year 
to 
the special 1.4 million yuan disease prevention fund. It will 
provide 100 million yuan in the coming three years to improve 
the drinking water in poverty-stricken areas. 
  Another six million yuan will be channeled toward updating 
the research equipment and facilities for preventing the 
diseases. A pharmaceuticals production center and a foundation 
are expected to be built and go into operation within the year. 
  An ample contingent of medical workers specially trained for 
prevention of endemic diseases is being built in the province 
and preferential policies have been formulated for promotion and 
pay for endemic disease specialists and medical workers. 
  Emphasis is being placed on spreading knowledge of endemic 
disease prevention and control and mobilizing the masses to 
fight against the diseases. 
  A book on prevention and cure of the endemic diseases was 
published by the provincial medical department and educational 
commission and will be used for teaching in primary and high 
schools throughout the province this year.

  [Text] Yesterday, municipal leading comrades, including Gao 
Dezhan, Zhang Lichang, and Li Shenglin travelled separately to 
visit enterprises and salute the families of workers with 
difficulties in the municipality and to send the warmth and 
concern of the party and the government to the masses of people 
on behalf of the municipal party committee and government so 
that all workers will have a happy and harmonious Spring 
Festival. 
  On that morning, Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal 
party 
committee, Zheng Zhiying, member of the standing committee of 
the municipal party committee, and Pan Yiqing, vice chairman of 
the municipal people's congress standing committee, travelled to 
a timepiece plant and held a forum with the plant leaders and 
workers' representatives. Gao Dezhan attentively listened to 
the enterprise production situation and asked in detail about 
the income and housing of workers and the educational situation 
of their children. Affected by some factors, such as the market, 
this timepiece plant, which was once a major profit and tax 
delivery plant of the municipality, experienced a slide in 
economic returns and suffered losses for many years. The 
enterprise leaders led the workers to deeply carry out reform, 
worked hard, and enabled the plant to witness an upturn. The 
average per capita income of workers rose from 2,200 yuan in 
1991 to 3,400 yuan in 1993. In the form of chatting domestic 
trivia, Gao Dezhan held cordial talks with the workers. He 
said: We are pleased to hear that you have increased your 
income. The Spring Festival will come soon. The municipal 
party committee and the municipal government have been concerned 
about the quality of life of the people throughout the 
municipality, particularly those enterprises and workers with 
temporary difficulties. Our purpose of coming here to see you 
today is to manage this matter of prime importance to you and to 
let the broad masses of workers across the municipality to have 
ease of mind and spend the Spring Festival happily. Your plant 
is an enterprise with difficulties, but it is an enterprise with 
hopes which will have a favorable turn for the better. From 
your experience, we have gained this enlightenment: Some 
enterprises with temporary difficulties may have a turn for the 
better, and may free themselves from difficulties, and 
revitalize as long as their higher and lower levels make 
concerted efforts and unceasingly deepen reform. During this 
year, all enterprises should regard deepening reform as the main 
task, do well in all aspects, and enable more enterprises to 
vitalize and more workers to become prosperous. Gao Dezhan 
said: Each and every enterprise, unit, and department, and all 
sectors across the municipalities should consciously submit 
themselves to and serve the overall situation of the whole 
party's work. That is to seize the opportunity, deepen reform, 
expand opening up, promote development, and maintain stability. 
We must firmly foster the ideology of relying on reform to 
promote development, correctly handle the relations of reform, 
development, and stability, promote the practice of doing solid 
work, speaking the truth, boosting enthusiasm for work, and 
achieving actual results in an effort to maintain and promote a 
sustained, speedy, and sound economic development, and social 
and political stability and unity in our municipality. 
  Gao Dezhan said: Recently, Comrade Jiang Zemin and Li Peng 
stressed repeatedly: "Things that have a bearing on the people's 
basic life and immediate interests are major matters of prime 
importance." Party committees and governments at all levels 
across the municipality and all working departments should 
conscientiously implement this directive, attach prime 
importance to these major matters, pay close attention to 
solving the issue on the immediate interests of the broad masses 
of people with a high sense of responsibility and great energy, 
and allow no carelessness or dereliction of duty of any kind. 
At present, it is necessary to realistically attend to the work 
of caring for the well-being and doing practical things for the 
masses during the Spring Festival period and concentrate energy 
on managing well all things we should manage. We should give 
special care to the living of resigned and retired cadres, 
workers, families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen, 
people enjoying government subsidies, urban and rural workers 
with difficulties, households taking relief, and childless old 
people and guarantee that no household will have great 
difficulties in living. Around the Spring Festival period, we 
should attend to the issue of "nonstaple foods," guarantee 
market supply, strengthen price management, and stabilize the 
market prices. Leading cadres at all levels should step up 
efforts to make this work a success with a sense of great 
responsibility and initiative. Leaders of departments, 
localities, units, and enterprises that fail to do this work 
well should be held responsible for the consequences and called 
to account if problems arise. 
  Gao Dezhan also went to see Zhang Fenglin, a worker of 
Tianjin Canvas Plant. Zhang Fenglin has been elected municipal 
model worker for the third time. Serving as a lathe operator for 
more than 20 years, he never took sick leave until he sprained 
his back recently. Gao Dezhan held his hands firmly and said: 
Our Tianjin's working class has made tremendous contributions 
to the whole country and Tianjin's development. The party and 
government will never forget you. The working class is the main 
force in deepening reform and developing the economy. Model 
workers are also the same. We should give them greater 
attention and good care. Gao Dezhan hoped that Zhang Fenglin 
would feel at ease while taking rest and nourishment to regain 
his health and wished him a happy Spring Festival. Gao Dezan 
urged the plant leaders to arrange work for Zhang Fenglin after 
his recovery and take more care of his quality of life. 
  At 0900 in the morning, Mayor Zhang Lichang and Zhang 
Guangwen, secretary general of the municipal government, 
traveled to the municipal woolen sliver plant. As soon as they 
got out of the car, they went directly to the workshop to visit 
workers at the forefront of production. Zhang Lichang cordially 
shook hands and held talks with the workers. He asked in detail 
about their living conditions, particularly about the issuance 
of their Spring Festival subsidies. On hearing an affirmative 
rely, Zhang Lichang was very pleased and smiled. Zhang Lichang 
also held a forum with the plant workers and directly listened 
to their opinions about the municipal government. Zhang Lichang 
said: Our party's fundamental purpose is to serve the people 
wholeheartedly and the final aim is to improve the living 
standards of the masses. Leading cadres at all levels should 
always care for the hardships of the masses and unceasingly 
enhance awareness in serving the people. In doing our work, we 
should begin with caring for the living of the masses and end at 
raising the masses' living standards. All our leading cadres 
came from the masses. There is no reason for them to forget or 
cut themselves off from the masses. They should always keep the 
well-being of the massed in mind, speak for them, and support 
them. Leading cadres at all levels, particularly enterprise 
leading cadres, should emancipate the mind, change ideas, expand 
the degree of reform, do a good job in enterprise grafting, 
readjustment, and transformation, raise economic efficiency, and 
improve their living standards. Enterprises running at half 
capacity or brought to a standstill should use their brain, try 
by all possible means to find work for their workers, guarantee 
their basic income, let them feel ease of mind and have 
enthusiasm for work, and make contributions to promoting 
Tianjin's development. 
  On hearing that although the woolen sliver plant suffered 
deficits, its workers still have an unyielding spirit, Zhang 
Lichang praised them repeatedly and said: The Tianjin people 
have the spirit of acknowledging their disparities but never 
admitting that they have been defeated. The people of Tianjin 
are not stupid and the level of cadres across the board are not 
low. As long as we mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, 
Tianjin will have great hope in development. 
  Zhang Lichang also travelled to home of Xing Songshi, a 
retired model worker of Dongfeng Building Materials Plant, to 
give him a salute. He sincerely asked Xing Songshi about his 
living conditions, income, health, and application for medical 
expenses after his retirement. He said: Tianjin has a great 
number of model workers who worked quietly and made 
contributions at their ordinary posts. Although they have 
retired, the party and the people will not forget them. Cadres 
at all levels should show concern for and give them great care. 
On hearing that Xing Songshi is not in good health, Zhang 
Lichang said to him with great concern: You should see a doctor 
quickly and take care of yourself. Executive Vice Mayor Li 
Shenglin saluted workers at the state-run Tianjin printing and 
dyeing plant. He said: Developing production, solving the 
difficulties of workers, improving their living conditions, and 
raising the living standards are our urgent tasks. We should 
take advantage of this opportunity to send warmth to all 
households, further mobilize all workers to follow the path of 
reform, and urge them to improve themselves with their own 
efforts. Li Shenglin also visited Ma Fengqian, a worker of 
quartz watch plant with difficulties.

  [Excerpt] On 26 January, the municipal government held a 
meeting on urban collective economic work. The meeting 
profoundly implemented the guidelines of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the Second Plenary 
Session of the Sixth Municipal Party Committee and arranged for 
the urban collective economic work for this year in line with 
the demands set by the municipal economic work conference. 
  Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, made 
an important speech at the meeting. Vice Mayor Zhang Haosheng 
made a work report. 
  Gao Dezhan pointed out in his speech: We should further 
enhance our ideological understanding and strengthen the sense 
of urgency and the sense of responsibility for accelerating the 
development of the collective sector of the economy. Going all 
out to develop an urban collective economy constitutes not only 
an important move to accelerate China's economic development, 
but also plays a positive role in promoting the development of 
the socialist market economy. Since the third plenary session of 
the 11th CPC Central Committee, particularly over the past 
several years, Tianjin's collective economy has developed 
greatly, and the economic strength of districts and 
neighborhoods has been enhanced. Practice shows that urban 
collective economy has already become an important component 
part of Tianjin's national economy. It should be noted, 
however, that the development of Tianjin's urban collective 
economy is not good enough. We should keep sober-minded, 
further enhance our sense of urgency and our sense of 
responsibility, pioneer new ideological trains, and adopt 
energetic measures and every possible means to create a new 
situation in urban collective economy. We should fully 
understand the importance of accelerating urban collective 
economy under the new situation. First, urban collective 
economy constitutes the major force of Tianjin's national 
economy, plays an irreplaceable role in invigorating the economy 
and accelerating the development, and has already become one of 
the new important economic growth points of the municipality. 
Second, accelerating the development of the urban collective 
economy is conducive to improving the living standards of urban 
residents. Third, accelerating the development of the urban 
collective economy may greatly increase the financial revenues 
of districts and neighborhoods. 
  Gao Dezhan said: This year is critical to accelerating the 
reform, opening up, and modernization drive of the municipality. 
As a new important growth point to accelerate the municipal 
economic development, the urban collective economy must develop 
rapidly. In the course of efficiently running state-owned 
enterprises, we should allow the people to freely develop 
township enterprises, foreign- invested enterprises of the three 
types, urban collective economy, individual economy, and private 
economy, and should allow the simultaneous development of these 
enterprises and these sectors of the economy. In developing 
urban collective economy, we must further emancipate our mind, 
open up our train of thought, and go all out to accelerate the 
pace of development. Those that have a good market and 
efficiency may develop actively. 
  Gao Dezhan stressed: We must foster the idea of depending on 
reform to accelerate development in order to expedite 
development with reform. The general guiding ideology for the 
reform of collective enterprises is to emancipate the mind in a 
way more vigorous than that of state-owned enterprises and to 
carry out reform in an even more flexible and energetic manner. 
The reform programs of collective enterprises may include 
diverse forms based on free choice in line with their respective 
conditions, such as the shareholding cooperative system, the 
system of being owned by the state but run by the people, the 
system of being owned publicly but run privately, partnership 
management, management on a leasing basis, and management on a 
contract basis. Enterprises should adopt what most conforms to 
the conditions of enterprises; what is most conducive to 
liberating productive forces, to increasing the accumulation of 
the state, to increasing the momentum for development of 
enterprises, and to improving the living standards of workers 
and staff. Enterprises should continue to increase the income 
of workers and staff members on the premise of developing 
production, improving management, and increasing economic 
returns. 
  Gao Dezhan stressed in conclusion: We should actually 
strengthen leadership over the work concerning urban collective 
economy, list the work as an important item on the daily agenda, 
and conscientiously study how to solve the problems in reform 
and development. The government should actually transform 
functions and further lift restrictions on collective 
enterprises in an effort to administer enterprises as little as 
possible and do as many tangible things as possible for 
enterprises. All the districts, bureaus, and units that 
undertake the function of managing the urban collective economy 
should exert great efforts and adopt bold measures to accelerate 
the development of the collective economy. The urban collective 
economic office under the municipal government should strengthen 
guidance, coordination, and service to the development of the 
collective economy in order to create favorable conditions for 
developing this economy. Tianjin has a great potential and 
bright prospects in developing the urban collective economy. 
Thus, Tianjin should make great efforts to overcome 
difficulties with a view to developing the urban collective 
economy in an even better and faster way and making new 
contributions to invigorating the economy. 
  Vice Mayor Zhang Haosheng summarized, in his speech, the 
municipality's urban collective economic work in 1993 and made 
arrangements for this year's work. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The municipal foreign affairs work conference was 
held at the southern building of the cadres club on 26 January. 
Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, made a 
speech at the conference. He stressed that we should 
conscientiously understand the situation, grasp favorable 
opportunities, exert great efforts to attend to the local 
foreign affairs work, promote the opening of the municipality to 
the outside world, and quicken the development of Tianjin's 
economy. 
  In his speech, Gao Dezhan first extended regards to the 
comrades who have diligently been working on the foreign affairs 
front. He said: The work relating to foreign affairs is of 
extreme importance and influences the overall situation. We 
should conscientiously implement the guidelines of the sixth 
national meeting of foreign affairs office directors, further 
strengthen the local foreign affairs work in the new year, 
promote the opening of the municipality to all directions, 
promote economic development, and ensure the smooth progress of 
work relating to foreign economic relations and trade. He 
pointed out: At present, Tianjin has further expanded the scale 
of opening to the outside world, improved the investment 
environment, and quickened the pace of using foreign capital. 
Therefore, the comrades engaged in the work relating to foreign 
affairs must undertake important duties. This year, we should 
extensively expand the scale of opening to all directions; 
expand contacts with foreign countries; make foreign friends 
extensively; strengthen external propaganda; improve the 
investment environment; attract increasingly more foreign 
businessmen, personages of banking circles, and entrepreneurs to 
come to Tianjin to invest, conduct cooperation, make trips, and 
pay visits; introduce international human, material, and 
financial resources to Tianjin; and promote the acceleration of 
Tianjin's economy. 
  Gao Dezhan pointed out: We should pay high attention to 
foreign affairs work and strive to create a new situation in 
Tianjin's foreign affairs work. The local foreign affairs work 
is an important component part of the whole country's overall 
foreign affairs work. The leaders at various levels and all 
departments should further improve the understanding about 
foreign affairs, pay high attention to the foreign affairs work, 
and strive to achieve local foreign affairs work in the new 
situation. He stressed: The foreign affairs departments should 
persistently take economic construction as a key link. 
Simultaneously, the foreign affairs work has its own special 
features and tasks. We should grasp foreign affairs policies, 
strengthen macroeconomic management, and serve the expansion of 
opening up and economic development. While related to foreign 
economic relations and trade, foreign affairs work is also 
different. Both supplement and promote each other. We should 
unite with all forces, form cohesive power, and achieve foreign 
affairs work. In doing foreign affairs work, we should pioneer 
new ways of thinking, suit the demands of the situation of 
reform and opening up, and make new breakthroughs in the new 
year. 
  Gao Dezhan urged: We should strengthen the macroeconomic 
management of foreign affairs work and exercise centralized and 
unified leadership over foreign affairs work. Different 
departments should assume different responsibilities and make 
concerted efforts to bring their functions into better play. We 
should realistically strengthen the foreign affairs work and 
ensure the smooth progress of foreign contacts. It is necessary 
to further strengthen the construction of foreign affairs 
workers contingents, strengthen training and education, and 
comprehensively upgrade the quality of contingents. We should 
strictly conduct education on the discipline governing foreign 
affairs, foster a good image of foreign affairs cadres, achieve 
the foreign affairs work, and make contributions to further 
expanding the opening of Tianjin to the outside world and 
developing the economy. 
  In his speech, Ye Disheng, vice mayor of the municipality, 
delineated expectations on foreign affairs work departments in 
the municipality. Geng Jianhua, chairman of the foreign affairs 
office of the municipal government, relayed the guidelines of 
the national meeting of foreign affairs office directors, summed 
up the 1993 foreign affairs work, and arranged the work tasks 
for 1994.

  [Text] Tianjin, February 21 (XINHUA) -- This port city has 
become a golden channel for foreign trade in north China, 
according to the municipal government. 
  In 1993, the handling capacity of Tianjin port topped 37 
million tons, up 27 percent over the previous year, or eight 
million tons more than in 1992. 
  More than 22 million tons of it, or some 60 percent, was for 
imports and exports, a rise of 15 percent from a year earlier, 
the highest increase rate among the country's large ports. 
  Latest statistics show that foreign trade through Tianjin 
port were worth 12.5 billion U.S. dollars last year, and about 
70 percent of the trade volume resulted from imports and exports 
via the port by other parts of the country. [sentence as 
received] 
  The port now has business ties with all the provinces and 
regions of the country, as well as more than 160 countries and 
regions across the world. 
  Situated on Bohai Bay, Tianjin is economically important to 
north China, whose imports and exports are conducted mainly 
through the port. But the port's annual volume of two-way trade 
remained at around seven million tons before the country's drive 
of reform and opening-up was launched 15 years ago, owing to the 
lack of berths and limited storage capacity. 
  This year, Tianjin port became one of the first in China to 
exercise autonomy in collecting funds and expanding cooperation 
with overseas. The port's infrastructure has consequently much 
improved. 
  The port has built the country's largest wharf for 
containers, with annual handling capacity reaching 700,000 
standard containers. 
  Tianjin port has also introduced advanced loading and 
unloading equipment to enable it to handle 3.5 million and 3.2 
million tons of bulk grain and salt a year, respectively. 
  Meanwhile, the installation of some modern packing equipment 
has helped Tianjin port become one of China's three largest 
centres for packing bulk fertilizers. 
  Tianjin port is also home to the country's first 10,000-ton 
three-sided freight berth and the first oil berth exclusively 
for shipping oil from southern Xinjiang, a remote region in 
northwest China. 
  Tianjin port now has more than 130 berths, 44 of which are 
10,000-ton ones. 
  Tianjin has now ten ports engaged in foreign trade. 
  The expanded Tianjin airport has an apron of 155,000 square 
meters, capable of accommodating the parking of 17 large and 
medium-sized planes at the same time. The 3,200-meter-long and 
50-meter-wide runway allows landing and taking-off of all sorts 
of planes below 300 tons. 
  Designed to allow 90,000 landings and take-offs a year, the 
airport is among China's six largest. It saw a throughput of 
380,000 passengers and 270,000 tons of cargo in 1993. 
  Tianjin has also built China's first port for the shipment 
of 
liquefied sulphur and set up the country's first cross-border 
truck transportation corps. 
  Sources said that the annual handling capacity of Tianjin 
has 
increased by 30 million tons in the past 15 years. During that 
period, the port city handled a total of 290 million tons of 
cargo, worth more than 100 billion U.S. dollars.

Ruihuan Inspects Zhuhai's Development, Praises Its Super-Normal 
Plan, Grand Structure"] 
  [Text] Zhuhai, 16 Feb (WEN WEI PO)--During the Spring 
Festival period, Li Ruihuan, memeber of the CPC Central 
Committee Politburo Standing Committee and chairman of the CPPCC 
National Committee, went to Zhuhai on an inspection tour. He 
said that Zhuhai has followed a course featuring a high starting 
point and a high level and has taken into account both long-term 
and immediate developments in city planning and economic 
construction, adding that Zhuhai has rosy prospects. 
  Accompanied by Xie Fei, CPC Central Committee Politburo 
member and Guangdong CPC Committee secretary; Liang Guangda, 
Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee Standing Committee member, 
Zhuhai City CPC Committee secretary, and Zhuhai mayor; and 
others, Chairman Li visited the terminal which can handle 20,000 
tonnes of cargo at Zhuhai port in western Zhuhai; a coal 
terminal under construction, which can handle 100,000 tonnes of 
coal; Zhuhai airport; Doumen County; and the construction site 
of the Qiao bridge, which is the advance project of the 
Lingdingyang bridge. He also toured the city. 
  While at Zhuhai port, after listening to a report on 
development of the port, Chairman Li inquired in detail about 
the plan and construction of support facilities for the port. 
Standing in Gaolan Island and looking at the natural haven 
hemmed in by mountains on three sides, he said happily: You 
built a port and turned a deserted beach into a treasured place, 
killing two birds with one stone. 
  At the Zhuhai airport, after listening to an account of the 
development of the airport, Chairman Li was concerned about the 
support facilities at the airport and asked whether aviation and 
ground management could meet the demands of emergency take off 
and landing. Xie Fei added: The construction of the Zhuhai 
airport provided new experiences in many respects. Guangzhou 
will follow the example of Zhuhai if it decides to build more 
airports. 
  At the construction site of the Qiao bridge, Mayor Liang 
Guangda briefed Chairman Li on the planning and preparations for 
the building of the bridge spanning the sea and on the social 
benefits and experiences which will be created from real estate 
development following the completion of the bridge. 
  While in Zhuhai, Chairman Li also heard reports on work done 
by the city party committee and government. He fully affirmed 
the unusual courage displayed by Zhuhai in carrying out the 
reform and opening policy and in making experiments as well as 
the achievements made by Zhuhai in city planning, economic 
development, environmental protection, and birth control. Based 
on thorough investigations, the chairman said: Zhuhai has 
acquitted itself splendidly and has a broad vision in planning. 
Zhuhai not only took into account its own development, but also 
put itself in economic relationships with South China and even 
Southeast Asia, so it could forge far-sighted plans for its city 
construction. It really deserves praise for its excellent 
performance. Major projects in coordination with the city 
construction, such as Zhuhai port, Zhuhai airport, and the 
Zhuhai bridge have got under way in succession and the patterns 
of a major port and large-scale industry have been outlined. In 
a few years' time, Zhuhai's development will make it difficult 
for other cities in the country to bear comparison. Chairman Li 
was very appreciative of the way land had been developed, used, 
and managed in Zhuhai. He said: Since the reform and open 
policy were introduced, many cities in the country have been 
exploring means of land development, but Zhuhai's experiments 
have proven most successful. Zhuhai displayed boldness in 
making huge investments in infrastructural development with the 
result that land values have been raised. The government has 
made money through land development and has in turn used the 
money to expand construction, thus enabling economic growth to 
follow a steady upward course. In addition, the government 
formulated a complete set of laws and regulations for 
management. Zhuhai's experience is worth learning from. 
Chairman Li fully affirmed a course featuring a high starting 
point and a high level followed by Zhuhai in economic 
development. He said: Zhuhai's policy-makers had their eyes on 
the next 10 or 20 years rather than on setting up an additional 
one or two enterprises in planning economic development, so 
their major construction projects had high starting points and 
were of a fundamental nature. This allowed Zhuhai to catch its 
rivals at an advantage in future competition. He also 
maintained: Economic development should be promoted in line 
with local conditions. Given necessary conditions, some places 
should press ahead faster. We must not impose rigid uniformity.

<F P=106> [Article by Ren Jianxin: "Strengthen Procuratorial and </F>
Judicial Work To Guarantee Reform, Opening Up, and Stability"] 
  [Text] In the past year, under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the guidelines of the 14th National Party 
Congress, the people of all nationalities in China have seized 
opportunities and deepened reform. As a result, the national 
economy has been growing vigorously, social and political 
stability has continued, and major progress has been made in the 
modernization drive. Under the leadership of party committees 
at all levels, procuratorial and judicial departments across the 
country have safeguarded the stable social environment required 
for China's reform and development by further improving their 
work, effectively thwarting the sabotage of hostile forces at 
home and abroad, dealing appropriately with some emergencies 
that could have a great impact on their work, ceaselessly 
carrying out various forms of struggle against crime, 
concentrating on investigating and handling major economic 
crimes such as embezzlement and bribery, seriously implementing 
measures for consolidating public security and order, and 
improving law enforcement and legal services in the economic 
sphere. 
  This year is a very important and crucial year for deepening 
the reform. Many major measures will be comprehensively taken 
to establish a socialist market economic structure on the basis 
of the blueprint drawn up by the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee, and our reform will enter a critical 
stage in which wholesale advances and breakthroughs in major 
areas will be sought simultaneously. Some new contradictions 
and problems will emerge along with the deepening of reform and 
the adjustment of relations of interest. We must remain sober, 
analyze and judge the situation correctly, be prepared for 
danger in times of peace, provide for a rainy day, and do a 
better job of safeguarding social and political stability. 
  The main tasks for the procuratorial and judicial front in 
1994 are implementing the guidelines of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, adhering to the 
strategic principle of "grasping two links at the same time and 
paying attention to both," meeting the requirements for 
establishing a socialist market economic structure, further 
strengthening and reforming procuratorial and judicial work, 
enhancing the functions of the people's democratic dictatorship, 
safeguarding national security, cracking down on criminal 
activities, improving the handling of major cases in the 
struggle against corruption, vigorously and comprehensively 
improving public security and order, and providing better legal 
protection and legal services for the socialist market economy. 
  1. Correctly Understand the Dialectical Relationship 
Between Reform, Opening Up, and Economic Development on the One 
Hand and Social Stability on the Other -- That Is, Reform and 
Opening Up, and Economic Development and Social Stability 
Promote One Another and Form a Single Entity -- and Doing 
Everything Possible To Maintain Political Stability 
  Deepening the reform, opening wider to the outside world, 
and 
accelerating development constitute a solid foundation for 
consolidating political stability and unity, and the 
prerequisite for reform and development is to maintain political 
stability. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has said: "Reform requires a 
stable political environment. Without this, nothing can 
succeed." Only by upholding the four cardinal principles, 
grasping the two links simultaneously, and preserving social and 
political stability can we effectively guarantee the smooth 
progress of reform, opening up, and economic construction. In 
the current situation in which reform and opening to the outside 
world are being accelerated, there has been a noticeable 
increase in the number of factors leading to instability for 
various reasons. Therefore, safeguarding stability has become 
even more important and urgent. The more we accelerate the pace 
of establishing the socialist market economy, the more we should 
strengthen the state apparatus of the people's democratic 
dictatorship and the more we should pay attention to 
safeguarding social and political stability. 
  Safeguarding political stability is the important 
responsibility of party committees, governments, and departments 
at all levels and of party and government leaders of various 
units. It is a task of all comrades in the party and of the 
people of all nationalities across the country, and is also the 
bounden duty of the procuratorial and judicial departments. 
Party and government leaders at all levels must adhere to the 
strategic principle of "grasping the two links at the same time 
and paying attention to both." While grasping reform and 
development, they should pay attention to the building of 
spiritual civilization, strengthen party building, consolidate 
work on the ideological and cultural front, and carry out 
effectively their responsibility for safeguarding political 
stability. They should study, plan, guide, and check, in a 
timely manner, the work of safeguarding stability, promptly 
eliminate factors leading to instability, properly handle 
emergencies, and pay attention to solving the outstanding 
problems of the masses to ensure social stability. The cadres 
and workers of various departments and units should also enhance 
their sense of political responsibility in safeguarding 
stability, bear in mind that safeguarding stability is 
everyone's responsibility, plug loopholes in work, improve 
systems of work, and consciously make contributions to 
eliminating factors leading to instability. 
2. Correctly and Properly Handle the Contradictions Among 
the People Arising From the New Situation 
  A host of contradictions among the people are bound to 
surface in the course of deepening reform, opening wider to the 
outside world, and developing a socialist market economy. Party 
and government leaders at all levels must seriously study the 
characteristics, forms of expression, aggravating factors, 
preventive measures, and methods of dealing with the 
contradictions among the people that emerge under the new 
situation; take practical steps to change the work style, 
overcome bureaucracy and formalism; go deep into the midst of 
the people and help solve their actual difficulties; attach 
importance to properly attending to their grievances aired 
through personal visits or letters; make efforts to go to the 
masses to resolve their contradictions, and take active steps to 
prevent the contradictions from becoming more acute. At the 
same time, we must also strive to introduce and perfect a 
complete set of key measures for implementing the reforms, 
intensify publicity through the media before introducing the 
various measures of reform, enhance the tolerance level of the 
masses, and accelerate the establishment of various mechanisms 
designed to ensure social security. Party committees and 
governments in various localities must shoulder leadership 
responsibility, improve their ability to distinguish and handle 
the two types of contradictions amid complex situations, and 
promptly nip in the bud problems at the grass-roots level. 
  3. Strengthen and Improve Party and State Leadership 
and Management Over Religious Work Among Nationalities 
  Party committees and governments at all levels, particularly 
those in minority nationality areas, must consistently hold high 
the banner of promoting economic development and national unity, 
earnestly implement the "Law Governing Autonomous Regions of 
Minority Nationalities," comprehensively carry out the various 
policies and measures formulated by the party and the state for 
minority nationality regions, and strive to foster and 
consolidate national unity while accelerating economic 
development as well as ideological and cultural construction. 
We must step up education to publicize the Marxist concepts on 
nationalities and the legal system so that the minority peoples 
will learn how to safeguard their own legitimate rights and 
interests through legal proceedings, thereby gradually bringing 
the readjustment of relations between various nationalities into 
line with the legal system. We must take a clear-cut stand, 
justly and forcefully oppose ethnic splittism, and punish 
according to law those involved in illegal and criminal 
activities in creating separatism among nationalities. We must 
strengthen management over religious affairs according to the 
law, comprehensively and correctly implement the policy on 
religion set out by the party and the state, protect the normal 
religious activates and the legitimate rights and interests of 
religious circles in accordance with the law, and firmly punish 
those who take advantage of religion to interfere in political 
affairs or violate the law and commit crimes. At the same time, 
we must comprehensively promote among those who follow religions 
the Marxist concepts on religion, patriotism, and the legal 
system and rally the broad masses of followers under the banner 
of economic development and bringing prosperity to the 
motherland, guiding them in carrying out religious activities in 
accordance with the Constitution and the law. 
4. Actively Participating in the Struggle Against 
Corruption and Concentrating on Investigating and Hanlding Major 
Cases of Economic Crime Such As Embezzlement and Bribery 
  Strengthening clean government and combating corruption 
constitute the necessary condition and important guarantee for 
establishing the socialist market economic structure and are 
keys to safeguarding stability. Procuratorial and judicial 
departments at all levels and the entire police force should 
conscientiously study and implement the party Central 
Committee's instructions on launching the struggle against 
corruption and, under the leadership of party committees and 
governments, successfully push forward the struggle. 
  It is necessary to rely on education and law to combat 
corruption and promote honesty. The important thing is that 
party and government leaders at all levels must enhance their 
understanding and be determined to work hard to implement 
policies. Procuratorial and judicial departments should take 
the initiative in participating in combating corruption, enforce 
law strictly, be serious in handling cases, concentrate on 
investigating and handling major cases involving crimes 
committed by law-enforcement personnel, and strictly carry out 
their legal responsibility. Party committees at all levels and 
their political and legal commissions must provide better 
leadership, seriously supervise the handling of major cases, 
support procuratorial and judicial departments in strictly 
enforcing laws, overcome resistance, and eliminate interference 
in all forms. The leadership of relevant procuratorial and 
judicial departments should strengthen guidance and supervision 
over investigation and prosecution of major cases and institute 
a responsibility system for handling cases to increase work 
efficiency and law-enforcement quality. Investigations must be 
pursued to the end no matter who is involved or what resistance 
is encountered. Anyone who hinders the prosecution of cases and 
protects corrupt elements must be given severe punishment 
according to party discipline and state laws. In prosecuting 
cases, it is necessary to pay attention to the political, 
economic, and social impact. In combating corruption and 
promoting honesty, it is important to go to the root of the 
problem. Education in law and professional ethics, with emphasis 
on building a clean government as the special topic, should be 
conducted in party and government offices and other key 
departments, so as to prevent and reduce, to the greatest 
extent, economic crimes such as embezzlement and bribery. 
  5. Adopting Forceful Meassures To Strengthen the 
Struggle Against Crime and Meting Out Timely Severe Punishment 
to Criminal Elements 
  Resolutely changing the situation in which insufficient 
efforts have been made to crack down on crime, effectively 
upgrading the results of cracking down on crime, and creating a 
social environment in which people can live and work in peace 
and contentment constitute the major responsibilities of 
procuratorial and judicial departments and the requirements for 
these departments set by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee. In 1994, in launching the struggle 
against crime, it is necessary to concentrate on cracking major 
cases, dismantling organized crime groups, and going after 
escaped criminals. To cope with their outstanding problems, 
various localities should adopt forceful measures and organize 
people to crack down on crime or tackle special types of crime. 
They should also strengthen investigation, prosecution, trial, 
and reform on a regular basis; check the steady rise in the 
number of major and serious cases; step up the anti-theft 
struggle; mobilize the masses to strengthen crime-prevention 
measures; eliminate breeding grounds for crime; resolutely ban 
prostitution and other related activities; resolutely eliminate 
social evils; round up all local criminal gangs; and exterminate 
all organized crime groups once they are discovered, never 
allowing them to exist. 
6. Further Mobilize Social Forces To Implement Various 
Measures for Comprehensively Improving Public Security and Order 
Under the New Circumstances 
  Efforts to comprehensively improve public security and order 
were emphasized many times in the decision of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and in speeches made 
by Jiang Zemin. In the new situation of developing the 
socialist market economy, it is necessary to work harder to 
improve public security and order in an all-round way. Not the 
slightest slackening of efforts in this respect is permitted. 
The focus of this work for this year is the following: First, 
great efforts should be made to introduce a responsibility 
system for leaders to implement the principle that the "persons 
in charge shall be responsible." Committees for comprehensive 
management of public security at all levels should work with 
relevant departments to draw up, as quickly as possible, rules 
for implementing "Some Provisions for Introducing the Leaders' 
Responsibility System for the Comprehensive Management of Public 
Security," promulgated by the five ministries and commissions of 
the central government. In the process of changing their 
operating mechanisms and establishing a modern enterprise 
system, enterprises and institutions should aggressively take 
the initiative in "guarding their gates, managing their 
personnel, and doing their work." It is necessary to conduct 
education in the legal system among the people, do a good job in 
spreading legal knowledge, and enhance the people's awareness of 
the law. It is necessary to strengthen networks for soldiers, 
the police, and the masses to jointly participate in crime 
prevention and efforts to improve public security and order. 
Second, making continued efforts to improve public security and 
order in key areas. While focusing on the requirements for 
developing the socialist market economy, it is necessary to take 
into full account the people's views, determine key areas to be 
tackled in line with local conditions, improve public security 
and order, and advance the comprehensive improvement of public 
security and order by concentrating on key areas. Third, 
special efforts should be made to resolve the problem of public 
security and order in rural areas. Agriculture, rural areas, 
and the peasants constitute the fundemantal issues in China's 
economic development and modernization drive. Solution of the 
current serious problem of public security in rural areas 
remains an urgent task. It is necessary to concentrate on 
villages and towns and areas adjacent to communication lines 
where public security is in a state of chaos, focusing on 
cracking down on hooligans and other serious criminals who 
undermine agricultural production. It is necessary to 
conscientiously study ways for the rational and orderly transfer 
of surplus laborers in rural areas and popularize the experience 
in governing villages according to law. It is necessary to 
enhance the role of the basic-level people's mediation 
committees so as to reduce the number of civil disputes and 
prevent contradictions from worsening. It is necessary to 
implement the guidelines of the central conference on rural work 
and reorganize grassroots party organizations, whose core 
consists of party branches, and consolidate autonomous mass 
organizations in stages within three to five years. It is 
necessary to consolidate and strengthen the number of rural 
people engaged in joint crime prevention and joint efforts to 
improve public security. In some localities the masses are 
willing to voluntarily pay for the hiring of personnel to 
safeguard public security. This should not be regarded as 
indiscriminate collection of charges. Fourth, it is necessary 
to conduct education in the legal system among young people, 
focusing on systematically educating middle school students in 
the legal system on a regular basis. It is necessary to 
strengthen control over the market for cultural products and 
over places where videos are shown in order to purify the public 
environment in which young people grow. Fifth, it is necessary 
to implement measures for resettling and educating convicts who 
have been released at the end of their prison term, as well as 
the personnel freed from centers for educating juvenile 
delinquents through labor. In particular, in dealing with those 
who refuse to work and give up bad habits and who may commit new 
crimes, it is necessary to draw up a package of control, 
management, and education measures. 
  7. Accelerating Reform of Procuratorial and judical 
Work So As To Provide Better Service to Development of the 
Socialist Market Economy 
  The establishment of a socialist market economic structure 
urgently requires a corresponding reform of procuratorial and 
judicial work. In accordance with the relevant guidelines of 
the party Central Committee, procuratorial and judicial 
departments should implement positive and yet discreet 
principles; persist in taking "conducive to three causes" -- 
developing the productive forces of our socialist society, 
increasing the overall strength of our socialist country, 
improving living standards -- as their fundamental criterion; 
and, guided by the correct principle of "perfecting the legal 
system, guaranteeing democracy, strengthening dictatorship, 
providing highly efficient service, and improving supervision," 
accelerate the pace of reform and opening to the outside world. 
In particular, mature reform measures must be introduced in a 
timely manner. 
  Procuratorial and judicial departments are urgently required 
to study a series of reform measures to support the 
establishment of a socialist market economic structure by the 
end of this century. For example, reforming and perfecting the 
judicial system and the administrative law-enforcement 
mechanism; establishing an integrated people's police structure 
and judicial structure to upgrade the quality of judicial work 
and administrative law-enforcement; establishing a sound 
self-restraint mechanism and law-enforcement supervisory 
meachanism in procuratorial and judicial departments; in 
conjunction with major economic reform measures and in 
accordance with the law governing the operation of the socialist 
market economy, studying the revision of economic laws and 
statutes and judicial interpretations, and improving and 
tightening the administration of economic laws so as to create a 
favorable legal environment for fair competition; in accordance 
with the principle of separating government administration and 
enterprise management, reforming the public security structure 
and public order management in enterprises and institutions; in 
accordance with changes in the economic structure in urban and 
rural areas, reforming the family registration system to bring 
about a rational transfer of surplus labor; increasing 
intermediate market organizations such as law and notary 
offices, reforming their operating mechanisms, and strengthening 
unified management of legal service organizations; simplifying 
administrative organs, reforming cadre and personnel 
administrative systems, and establishing a sound system for 
handling cases and guaranteeing expenditures; and so on and so 
forth. Policy decisions on reform should go hand in hand with 
those on legislation. It is necessary to step up efforts to 
draft and revise the "Police Law," "Regulations on Judges," 
"Regulations on Procurators," "Law on Lawyers," "Prison Law," 
"Notary Law," and "Compensation Law." It is also necessary to 
accelerate revision of the Criminal Law and the Criminal 
Procedure Law. These laws should be used to guide, promote, and 
guarantee the smooth progress of reform in procuratorial and 
judicial work. 
  8. Combating Corruption, Promoting Honesty, Tightening 
Discipline Among Procuratorial and Judicial Personnel, and 
Improving Their Work Style 
  As the main force and also one of the main sectors in the 
fight against corruption, procuratorial and judicial 
departments, while actively participating in the struggle 
against corruption, should first set an example in combating 
corruption and promoting honesty, allowing these two activities 
to promote one another. In combating corruption and promoting 
honesty, emphasis should be placed on educating the masses of 
cadres and the police rank and file. We must conscientiously 
organize them to study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping and arm them with the theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. All cadres and police 
rank and file should conscientiously study relevant central 
documents and regulations, serve as an exemplary servant and 
defender of the people, and consciously render service to 
reform, opening up, and economic construction. It is necessary 
to adopt resolute measures to correct unhealthy practices and 
strictly investigate cases involving corruption. At the same 
time, we must commend the advanced, promote healthy practices, 
and closely integrate combating corruption with promoting 
honesty. More importantly, it is necessary to learn from 
experiences and lessons, both past and recent, Chinese and 
foreign, improve the law-enforcement system, strengthen 
supervision mechanisms, and institutionalize and standardize 
strict law enforcement and the struggle to combat corruption and 
promote honesty. 
  In 1994 we must launch an education and rectification 
campaign in procuratorial and judicial departments and among the 
police force and conduct thoroughgoing education in the reasons 
for serving the people, the importance of being honest and 
hardworking, and the legal system. At the same, it is necessary 
to rely on the masses in investigating and strictly handling 
cases involving violations of discipline and the law. No 
indulgence toward wrongdoing shall be permitted. We must focus 
on investigating and handling major cases involving bribes, 
bending the law for personal gain, extortion, illegal 
detainment, and extorting confession by torture, and put a stop 
to chaotic lending, fund-raising, and establishment of financial 
institutions -- three chaotic phenomena. Cadres and police from 
public security, procuratorial, and judicial departments must 
strictly abide by the requirements concerning honesty and 
self-discipline set by the Central Committee, the circular on 
the "10 Prohibitions" issued by the Central Commission on 
Politics and Law, and the rules of discipline for building a 
clean government drawn up by procuratorial and judicial 
departments. We must work toward establishing strict discipline 
and clean workstyle as quickly as possible. 
9. Strengthening and Improving Party Leadership Over 
Political and Legal Work 
  In the period of transition to a socialist market economic 
system, those who are involved in political and legal work face 
a new situation, new problems, and more demanding tasks, thus 
making further enhancement of party leadership over this work 
all the more necessary. Party committees at all levels are 
urged to constantly study and resolve major problems in 
political and legal work, providing guidance, supervision, and 
support to political and legal departments to remove obstacles 
and enhance strict law enforcement in line with the requirements 
of maintaining, stabilizing, and enhancing law and order in a 
socialist market economic system. Party committees and 
governments at all levels should attach importance to resolving 
the practical problems of serious shortages of funds and 
outdated technology and equipment at political and legal 
departments, ensuring the normal operation of various 
undertakings by the state organs of dictatorship. 
  The committees on politics and law under the various levels 
of party committees are a form of organization that the party 
uses to enhance its leadership over political and legal work. 
It is necessary to strengthen these committees under various 
levels of party committees and give full play to their roles and 
functions. Committees on politics and law at all levels are 
called upon to carry out investigation and study in depth, 
become good advisers to party committees, offer more political 
guidance to politics and law departments, coordinate and promote 
closer cooperation among various politics and law departments, 
work out a system of legal restraints, and give full play their 
functions and roles. 
  Building socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
developing a socialist market economy is an unprecedented and 
great undertaking. Therefore, the tasks confronting political 
and legal departments are arduous yet glorious. Let us rally 
closely behind the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang 
Zemin at its core, adhere to the party's basic line, fulfil our 
duties, make bold explorations, work with one heart and one 
mind, accomplish various tasks, and make fresh contributions to 
maintaining stability and promoting reform, opening up, and 
socialist modernization!

  [Text] Beijing, February 23 (CNS) -- A sample survey shows 
that 89.3 percent of young respondents involved in this survey 
were convinced that corruption at present appearing in China was 
very serious or rather serious. Repulsive phenomena considered 
by young people are ranked in descending order as bureaucracy, 
seeking profit through the abuse of power, bribe-taking and 
corruption, dissipated living and other unspecific items. 
  The survey was conducted by a teenage research centre and an 
institute on politics for the youth and took the form of 
questionnaire between October, 1992, and May, 1993. The 
respondents were aged between 18 and 35 years and were from 
Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shandong, Liaoning, Sichuan and 
Guangxi. 
  When comparing the process of reform of the political system 
and that of the economic system, about 57.7 percent of the 
respondents said that political reform lagged behind economic 
reform. A total of 50.3 percent of the youth considered the key 
to political reform lay in the elimination of corruption and the 
establishment of decision-making and a supervision mechanism 
based on democracy. 
  A mere 7.7 percent of respondents said they had a solid 
belief in socialism while 14.2 percent gave a "no" answer. Most 
of the young people believed in socialism but were also puzzled 
with it. Items the youth feel worried about the most were in 
descending order too little income, lack of housing, poor 
inter-personal relations, inability to use one's learning in 
one's career, love and marriage problems, no chance to use one's 
talents and difficulties in going abroad.

<F P=106> [Dispatch by reporter Ren Weidong (0117 4850 2637): "Yunnan </F>
Province Severely Punishes Economic Crimes"] 
  [Text] Pu Chaozhu, secretary of the Yunnan Provincial CPC 
Committee, pointed out at a recent meeting to exchange 
information on the antigraft campaign to deal harsh blows to 
serious economic crimes: "The general situation of the 
anticorruption campaign is good and healthy. The three tasks 
set by the central authorities have been successfully carried 
out to various extents. Negative and decadent phenomena have 
been somewhat restrained; the masses have been initially aroused 
to action; the number of corruption cases reported by the people 
has increased sharply; and several activists daring to fight 
corruption and good party members and good cadres serving the 
people industriously and honestly performing their official 
duties have come to the fore." 
  The meeting, which was called by the Yunnan Provincial CPC 
Committee, was designed to sum up experiences to further carry 
out the antigraft campaign successfully. The provincial 
procuratorate and higher people's court briefed the meeting on 
how cases had been investigated and dealt with. 
  According to the statistics, procuratorial organs across the 
province last year placed on file for investigation and 
prosecution 1,348 economic cases, including corruption and 
bribery, of which 749 were serious and important cases. Of all 
the cases placed on file, 13 involved 1 million yuan each, and 
12 involved cadres at the county or section level and above. A 
total of 1,285 cases involving 1,524 people have been closed. 
Through trials, illicit money and stolen goods totally worth 
39.07 million yuan have been recovered. 
  The anticorruption campaign has won the wholehearted support 
of the broad masses of the people. Last year, the procuratorial 
organs heard 3,248 cases reported by the masses, and the number 
of cases reported in the August-December period was 2.4 times 
that of the previous seven months. Of all the cases placed on 
file for investigation by the procuratorial organs, 53 percent 
were reported by the masses. 
  A number of serious and important cases were made public at 
the meeting. The most spectacular cases were against the former 
deputy chief of the provincial personnel department who took a 
bribe of 200,000 yuan and a certain person called He, the former 
chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference of the Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, who 
embezzled 2 million yuan in public funds. In commenting on the 
successes, people here are saying that the provincial government 
meant what it said this time. 
  Provincial Party Committee Secretary Pu Chaozhu emphasized: 
"We must not overestimate the achievements made in the recent 
anticorruption drive and must not be content with these initial 
successes. We must be ready to carry out the struggle for a 
long time. We must, in accordance with the law and discipline, 
resolutely handle and promptly close those cases for which we 
have conclusive evidence, regardless of who is involved and in 
spite of any interference.

<F P=106> [Report by Bruce Gilley] </F>
  [Text] Six men have been charged in Wuhan, capital of 
Hubei Province, with the beating last month of a lawyer 
representing Taiwan investors in the city. The severe drubbing 
of Zhang Tao, which left him with a broken nose and leg, set off 
alarm bells in Beijing after it was revealed in the Taiwan media 
in mid-January. 
  Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation called for a full 
investigation, fearing it could mark a new trend of violence 
against Taiwanese bosses on the mainland. 
  Chinese officials connected with the case said Zhang's 
aggressive work on behalf of his Taiwanese clients appeared 
unrelated to the incident. "This was a civil dispute which had 
nothing to do with Zhang's supposed work for Taiwan," said Wang 
Guoyao, head of Hubei's Taiwan Affairs Offce, from Wuhan. "It 
was stirred up into a lot of nonsense in Taiwan." 
  On January 7, six men, armed with knives and sticks, forced 
their way into the Taiwan-owned Hansheng Computer Company, where 
Zhang worked as personnel manager. A scuffle ensued, which left 
Zhang and two company security guards in hospital. 
  The police did not begin investigating the case until the 
Wuhan Taiwan Business Association issued a statement that 
asserted: "There is no way the beating is related solely to 
Zhang's private affairs." 
  On orders from Beijing, Hubei's Governor, Jia Zhijie, 
demanded the police catch the six in order to prevent the case 
becoming a serious cross strait issue, sources said. The 
suspects were detained shortly before the lunar new year and had 
been charged, although none had been sentenced yet, Wang said. 
  Questioning of the men revealed they had beaten Zhang 
because 
he had agreed to pay only 280 renminbi (HK$246) to cover the 
hospital expenses of an old woman who herself had been beaten by 
a female driver of the firm, Wang said. The old woman, a nearby 
resident, had complained about the noise the driver made with 
the car horn every time she drove in and out of the factory gate. 
  "The actual hospital expenses were probably many times [the 
amount offered by Zhang]," Wang said. The old woman's godson 
had organised the men to "avenge the remaining expenses" from 
the stingy Zhang, he said. "The driver shouldn't have beaten 
the old woman and the godson and his friends shouldn't have 
beaten Zhang." 
  The head of the Wuhan Taiwan Business Association, Chen 
Fengrong, admitted the beating of Zhang did not concern his work 
for association members. "We thought this was the case at 
first, but since the arrests it has become clear this was an 
internal company matter," he said from Wuhan. "Since the lunar 
new year break I've been to visit Wang and we've basically 
agreed to put this matter behind us."

  [Text] Chinese civil aviation officials have reaffirmed 
their intention to ban the basic training of pilots abroad after 
1995, even though the country is facing a severe shortage of 
pilots. An official at the Civil Aviation Administration of 
China (CAAC) in Beijing said that lower costs and national pride 
were key factors behind the move. 
  However, Western aviation analysts have raised questions 
about the quality of the CAAC's Chengdu Flying College, 
especially if it is expanded too rapidly. 
  The official said a recent contract with Northwest Airlines 
to train 250 mainland pilots in the United States this year 
would not be affected as it mainly involved refresher courses 
for pilots of five Chinese airlines rather than basic training.

  [Text] Beijing, 18 Feb (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Today, 
Qian Qichen, member of the CPC Central Political Bureau and vice 
premier of the State Council, said that overseas exchanges 
should serve the central task of economic construction and serve 
China's foreign relations and China's reunification. 
  Qian Qichen said this in a speech to the Second Plenary 
Meeting of the Executive Council of the Overseas Exchanges 
Association of China. 
  Qian Qichen said: "In the four years since the founding of 
the Overseas Exchange Association of China, it has played a 
positive role in giving publicity to China's achievements in its 
reform, opening, and economic construction, in promoting unity 
and friendship with Overseas Chinese and foreign citizens of 
Chinese descent, and in developing cooperation and exchanges 
with overseas Chinese communities and foreign citizens of 
Chinese origin. I hope that the association will continue to 
play a better role in these aspects in the future." 
  Qian Qichen held: The new situation requires further 
expansion of China's overseas exchanges so that China may better 
understand the world and the world may also better understand 
China. This will thus set higher requirements for the work of 
the Overseas Exchange Association of China and will also create 
a broader scope of activity for the association. 
  When talking about the concrete hopes pinned on the Overseas 
Exchange Association, Qian Qichen said: Economic construction 
is the central task of the CPC and the Chinese Government. Our 
work in all trades should be closely tied to this central task. 
The work of the Overseas Exchange Association and its local 
branches at all levels should also be conducted closely around 
the central task. Only thus will they play an effective role as 
they should. After analyzing China's economic situation in the 
last two years, he said: When the world economy remained in a 
recession, there was sustained, rapid, and healthy economic 
development in China. The 1.2 billion Chinese people display 
broad market prospects, which have aroused interest and 
attention from more and more countries in the world and are 
greatly attractive to overseas investors and entrepreneurs, 
including overseas Chinese investors and entrepreneurs. This 
provides a favorable environment for the Overseas Exchange 
Association to conduct its work in order to serve our country's 
economic construction. 
  Qian Qichen said: In the development of foreign relations, 
mass organizations involved in foreign activities constitute an 
indispensable force, and their role should be brought into full 
play. Such organizations may have different characters and 
perform different functions, but they share one common point. 
That is, they are doing the work of making friends, building up 
friendship, promoting communication, increasing exchanges, and 
seeking common ground. The Overseas Exchange Association is 
oriented to Overseas Chinese and foreign citizens of Chinese 
origin. It has a large number of contacts among overseas 
Chinese in various social strata and has built up a rather 
profound friendship with some of them. Being mass organizations 
in some specific communities, the local branches of the Overseas 
Exchanges Association at all levels keep natural blood relations 
and fellow countryman fraternity with overseas Chinese and 
foreign citizens of Chinese origin. With these favorable 
conditions, they may more naturally and more flexibly make 
friends in a broad scope. 
  At the same time, Qian Qichen also hoped that overseas 
Chinese and foreign citizens of Chinese origin will settle down 
and take root in the foreign countries where they are living, 
and will get along in good terms with local people and make 
contributions to local economic development. 
  When talking about the role of the Overseas Exchanges 
Association of China in promoting the motherland's peaceful 
reunification, Qian Qichen said: To resume the exercise of 
sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao and to realize "peaceful 
reunification" between the two sides of the straits, we not only 
need cooperation between the Chinese and British Governments and 
between the Chinese and Portuguese Governments and pin hopes on 
the Taiwan authorities, but also need to rely on an increasing 
patriotic and reunification-upholding force among the 
compatriots in all social strata in Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan 
and rely on the joint efforts of all Chinese people and people 
of Chinese origin at home and abroad who support China's 
reunification. Because the local branches of the Overseas 
Exchange Association have broad and close connections with 
overseas Chinese, foreign citizens of Chinese origin, and the 
business communities and people in all social strata of Hong 
Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, they should actively give publicity to 
the policy of "one country, two systems" and other guidelines, 
principles, and policies for realizing China's peaceful 
reunification through their connections among Overseas Chinese 
and foreign citizens of Chinese origin. This will certainly be 
conducive to increasing exchanges, understanding, and common 
ground between the mainland on the one side and Hong Kong, 
Macao, and Taiwan on the other side, thus promoting the smooth 
return of Hong Kong and Macao and speeding up the process of 
peaceful reunification between the two sides of the strait. 
  Today's plenary meeting of the Second Executive Council of 
the Overseas Exchange Association of China was chaired by Qian 
Weichang, chairman of the association. Liao Hui, vice chairman 
of the association, delivered a work report in which he reviewed 
the association's work in 1993 and outlined the 1994 work plan. 
  At today's meeting, 46 new members headed by Chen Ziying 
were 
added to the Executive Council, and 16 new members were added to 
the Standing Committee of the Executive Council. Zhu Youjun, 
director of ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE, was appointed to be new 
secretary general for the association.

Statistical Work"] 
  [Text] Today, the national statistics work conference will 
open. The main task of this meeting is to sum up the main 
experiences in statistical work since Comrade Deng Xiaoping made 
his important talks during the inspection tour to the south and 
since the 14th party congress and to deeply study reform of the 
statistical system according to the requirements of establishing 
a socialist market economy, thus further enhancing the level of 
statistical work and promoting the sustained, rapid, and healthy 
[chi xu kuai su jian kang 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660] 
development of the national economy. 
  Statistics is an important part of the basic work of the 
state in exercising scientific policy-making and management. 
The party central leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the 
core attaches great importance to statistical work and cares 
deeply about it. Recently, to mark the 10th anniversary of the 
promulgation and enforcement of the "PRC Statistics Law," 
Premier Li Peng wrote: "Keeping accurate and timely statistics 
according to the law." Practice shows that only by keeping 
statistics according to the law can we ensure that statistics 
are accurate and timely; and only by ensuring the accuracy and 
timeliness of statistics can we guarantee the effectiveness of 
the information, consulting, and supervisory functions of 
statistics and guarantees the correctness of policies and their 
effective implementation. 
  Accuracy requires us to adhere to the principle of being 
realistic. That is, we must authentically record facts and must 
resolutely oppose any exaggeration and concealment. If we are 
not careful and rigorous in handling statistics or even practice 
fraud, then it is very likely that incorrect policies will be 
formulated and incalculable losses may be caused to economic 
construction. There have been extremely profound negative 
experiences in the past, and we should bear this in mind. 
  The value of information lies in its timeliness. That is, 
the transmission of information must be speeded up, and the work 
of monitoring, forecasting, and anticipating trends in the 
operation of the national economy must be strengthened. We 
should strive to provide the necessary information before 
leaders make policy decisions so that problems can be solved as 
soon as they appear. 
  Through reform and development in the past 10 or more years, 
the statistical work in our country has gradually moved onto a 
path specified by the legal system, and statistics organs have 
gradually expanded their functions from merely providing 
information to offering consulting services to the leading 
organs of the party and government and exercising effective 
supervision over economic operations. Under the current 
situation of speeding up the process of establishing the 
socialist market economic structure, our statistical work is 
also facing some new and stern challenges. On the one hand, due 
to changes in the economic base, changes have also occurred in 
those institutions subject to statistical investigation. Not 
only has the number of such institutions been increasing 
continuously, but they have become more and more complicated as 
a variety of economic elements, business organizational forms, 
and distribution patterns now coexist side by side. This will 
make it more difficult to conduct statistical investigations. 
On the other hand, due to changes in the pattern of interests, 
the phenomena of exaggeration, concealment, deliberately 
delaying reports, and refusing to submit reports have arisen in 
some localities and units, thus affecting the accuracy and 
timeliness of statistics. Therefore, it is necessary to 
positively advance reform of the statistical management system 
and statistical investigation methods, make great efforts to 
consolidate the legal system related to statistics, and ensure 
that statistics are actually handled, managed, and developed 
according to the law. 
  The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee 
pointed out: "The establishment and improvement of the 
socialist market economic structure must have standards and 
guarantees from a perfect legal system." This requirement is 
also applicable to statistical work. The Statistics Law in our 
country was formulated 10 years ago, and some provisions of the 
law may not be suited to the requirements of the establishment 
of the socialist market economic structure. Therefore, we 
should make revisions without delay and improve the law as soon 
as possible. Statistical legislation must give expression to 
the spirit of reform. It is necessary to seriously sum up 
practical domestic experience, boldly adopt successful foreign 
practices, and use the law to guide, promote, and guarantee the 
smooth development of reform in statistical work so that it will 
play a greater role in the state's scientific policy-making and 
macrocontrol. 
  Leading organs and leading cadres at all levels should 
firmly 
support the efforts of statistical organs to fulfill their task 
according to the law. It is necessary to further popularize 
legal knowledge related to statistics. All people related to 
the statistical work should study and understand the relevant 
law and should be conscious in abiding by the law and applying 
the law. All localities, institutions, and individuals must not 
impede statistical organs and personnel from collecting and 
reporting statistics to the upper authorities according to the 
law. Those who refuse to perform their statistical duty, 
deliberately evade or undermine the state's statistical 
supervision, practice fraud with statistics, or impede 
statistical organs and personnel from independently performing 
their duties specified by law must be investigated and punished 
according to the law. A small number of cases which have had a 
major impact should be exposed by the mass media. Thus, the 
handling of one case may educate a large number of people and 
may ensure the smooth conduct of statistical work.

  [Text] Beijing, February 22 (CNS)--There is an urgent need 
for a fundamental change to China's statistical and survey 
system, because the system no longer meets the increasingly 
complicated economic structure and diversified patterns involved 
by bodies subject to the current statistical system, the 
Director of the State Statistical Bureau, Mr Zhang Sai, said at 
a national statistical work meeting held today here. 
  The bureau sees the pattern for restructuring of the 
statistical system in such a way that a new statistical system 
had to be set up by which periodical general surveys would be 
staged centering on a regular sampling survey and helped by a 
comprehensive statistical graph, key investigation and 
scientific projection. The new system is aimed at ensuring the 
gathering of evidence for accurate, timely and comprehensive 
statistical figures for reference by the government in its 
decision-making. 
  Starting this year, the bureau will adopt a new statistical 
system in which collection of information will be made on a 
regular basis from the grass roots which can effectively reflect 
the market economy, marking a change from the planned economy to 
the market economy. Mr Zhang pointed out that some significant 
statistics collected in recent years showed trends and changes 
in the economy. As contradictions are growing prominent between 
partial and overall interests, regional and central interests 
and between individuals as well as collective interests and the 
state interests, the possibility of distortion of statistics is 
becoming greater. The original statistical system in line with 
the planned economy no longer meets the needs of the new 
situation and it is yet to be restructured. 
  The bureau has warned against falsification of statistics 
aimed at showing inaccurate results. Such statistics would have 
an adverse impact on decision-making regarding the economy made 
by the government and in turn result in damage to the national 
economy. It has to be seriously dealt with. 
  A large overhaul of national statistical practical will be 
jointly held by the Financial and Economic Committee of the 
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the 
Ministry of Supervision, the Bureau of Legislative Affairs of 
the State Council and the State Statistical Bureau in the second 
half of this year. Entities and officials found guilty of 
malpractice in statistical practice will be seriously dealt with 
and punished.

  [Text] Beijing, February 23 (XINHUA) -- China has reported 
a fairly good economic performance in the first month of 1994, 
with a steady rise of industrial production and a stable 
domestic market. 
  In January this year, China's industrial output value 
chalked 
up 290 billion yuan (about 32.3 billion U.S. dollars), up 33.2 
percent over the same month last year, according to the State 
Statistics Bureau (SSB). 
  The first month of 1994 also saw a 22 percent increase in 
retail sales, with total volume topping 120 billion yuan. 
  China's imports and exports were worth 10.5 billion U.S. 
dollars in January this year. The exports were 4.8 billion 
dollars, up 43.1 percent over the same month last year. 
  The SSB figures show that state revenue went up 86.2 percent 
in January, which means a relatively comfortable balance of 
revenue and expenditure. 
  However, officials of the SSB said that inflation, 
continuing 
for several months, still posed a threat to the sustainable and 
healthy growth of the national economy. The situation facing 
state-owned enterprises was also tough, they said. 
  Economists here called on the government to continue 
strengthening macro-economic control so that inflation and fixed 
assets investment could be kept under check.

  [Text] Beijing, February 23 (CNS)--According to a report 
by the State Statistical Bureau, the economic situation last 
month in China was on the whole normal. The new tax system 
which became effective early this year has seen its results with 
the financial revenue in the country increasing by 86 percent 
last month. The balance between revenue and expenditure in the 
month was RMB 5.1 billion [renminbi]. 
  Such sharp growth in financial revenue is mainly attributed 
to a lower base figure for January last year on which the 
calculation was based and the early submission to the state 
coffers of proceeds from national bonds in addition to 
continuous rapid economic growth. The national economy for last 
January showed some points worth nothing. 
  Industrial production maintained its quick growth with a 
sound balance between production and marketing. The industrial 
output value rose by 33.2 percent last January, a daily gain of 
19.9 [as received] percent on average when taking into 
consideration holidays. The sales rate increased by 1.3 
percentage points over the same month last year. 
  The domestic market was relatively stable last month when 
the 
retail value of consumer goods rose by 22 percent over the same 
month last year, showing a 5 percent growth after taking into 
consideration the price factor. 
  Consumers tended to buy products of high grade with various 
kinds of famous brand and high-quality products seeing the best 
sales. The rural market took a turn for the better with the 
retail value there last January keeping pace with that in the 
urban market. 
  Imports showed a rapid gain and exports registered a rebound 
with a rise in foreign exchange earnings. Imports increased by 
78 percent in January and exports by 43.1 percent with imports 
surpassing exports by U.S.$900 million. 
  The State Statistical Bureau said that the economy was 
proceeding at a steady pace at present while at the same time 
some problems concerning the economic life remained. Market 
prices, already at a high level, continued to climb last 
January. Consumption prices in 35 main cities rose by 23.3 
percent in January over the same month last year. Various kinds 
of items saw their prices rise to various extents with food, 
clothing, medical health care and leisure-time activities as 
well as education showing a higher gain of price ranging between 
4 and 6.4 percent over January last year. 
  The current economy is generally regarded as an extension of 
that in the fourth quarter last year. It showed quick growth on 
the one hand while on the other some problems were still 
prominent and macro-economic regulation needed to be kept in 
place. 
  Authoritative sources were convinced that a rather tight 
policy on the macro-economy should be maintained. Fixed assets 
investment underway should be kept under control in terms of 
size and direction while the gross loan volume and financial 
order should be maintained with a timely adjustment necessary in 
order to keep a balance between supply and demand.

<F P=106> [Report by P.N. Kandinsky] </F>
  [Text] Professor Li of the Shanghai Academy of Social 
Sciences wasn't impressed when a Communist Party newspaper 
invited him to write an article on the "socialist market 
economy" in late 1992. 
  "Those people have gone on preaching about their kind of 
socialism for the last three years," he said. "Who knew what 
they really wanted?" Li didn't write anything for it, but he 
continued to publish articles about his market theories in other 
media. "Publications on the lower levels of the official 
hierarchy have a better reputation," he said. "Intellectuals of 
my generation no longer have any hope of working with this 
regime." 
  But the newspaper kept asking him, most recently late last 
year, shortly after the party's central committee held its 
annual plenary session which adopted a decision to embrace more 
economic reforms. "I finally agreed, thinking this time it might 
be different," he said. "But once again, I was being stupid." 
  The editor of the newspaper called Li not long after the 
article had been submitted. "I'm sorry, but we can't use your 
piece," he said. "Why?" Li asked. The editor explained: 
"Didn't you recently write an article for a Hong Kong 
newspaper? According to the responsible authorities, you did 
and that article raised some problematic points." 
  And so, the professor's article was killed. "Every time the 
government fails, it is because it has refused to listen to its 
best critics," Li said. 
  China's best-trained economists, including those in the 
government think-tanks, are predicting the regime's single 
minded pursuit of high growth will have disastrous consequences, 
according to Li. But Chinese leaders have yet to mend their 
relations with the intellectuals, which were rent asunder after 
the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989. 
  The party's "policy on intellectuals" is still one of deep 
distrust. Soon after Tiananmen, the regime convened a series of 
meetings to "sum up the experience" of how the party had won 
that "historical victory." The central issue was explaining the 
spread of "bourgeois liberalism" which had almost toppled the 
communist regime. Their conclusion: It was still necessary to 
continue the class struggle in the Stalinist and Maoist sense. 
Class analysis, not economic development, should remain the 
"lifeline of the party". 
  The class enemy, the party ideologues declared, was the 
middle class represented by troublemakers among the 
intellectuals. Their theory, according to Li, is that 
intellectuals know how much more their counterparts in the West 
are paid. Their resentment has corrupted them into refusing to 
work for the party and attacking the proletarian state. 
  "Examine the speeches and articles by people like Deng 
Liqun--the party's leading hardline ideologue--or Wang Renzhi, 
who was director of the party's propaganda department after the 
1989 crackdown," said Li. "From their speeches, you can see 
clearly that the middle class is the enemy and intellectuals are 
its representatives." 
  There were open clashes between party bosses and 
intellectuals at the meetings to sum up the lessons of 1989, he 
said. At one session, he recalled, Wu Jinglian--one of China's 
leading economists--challenged the party speaker by saying that 
no government could hold itself up without support from 
intellectuals, nor could society become stable without a large, 
middle income population. "Of course, they rejected this kind 
of criticism," he said. "They don't believe that a middle class 
is necessary to sustain stability. They think because they have 
the Army their guns and tanks will be enough for them to rule 
China forever." 
  Since the mid-1980s, economists have been strenuously 
advocating many of the reform ideas which the regime is now 
tentatively considering. The proposal for a genuinely 
independent central bank, for instance, was rejected by the 
Premier, Li Peng, many times. At one State Council meeting in 
1991, Li became furious when banking reform was mentioned. "The 
People's Bank [China's nominal central bank] is nearly the last 
bit of power that I have left," Li yelled at the proponent. "If 
you want to rob me of this too, why don't you just proclaim 
yourself premier?" It may not be coincidental that the new 
banking reforms were only approved while Li was on sick leave 
after a heart attack last year. 
  "I no longer care whether they use my ideas or not," a 
professor at Beijing University said. "These are the same ideas 
we put forward back in the mid-1980s and which they condemned as 
"bourgeois liberalism"--if they don't use my ideas, they 
themselves will pay the price." 
  Relations between the regime and intellectuals were 
different, he said, from the time "when we were enthusiastic 
about the reform and optimistic about its success. Now, it is 
more like a business relationship: You place an order, and I'll 
deliver the goods--if I feel like it." 
  There were several thousand Chinese graduate students with 
economics majors in Western countries. But the regime had never 
listened to their opinions, he said. "This is a terrible waste 
of human resources at a time when China is faced by all sorts of 
dangers." 
  As one cultural critic said: "China fall apart. But if it 
reaches that point, it will be because of the regime's policy 
blunders. The worst mistake is to label those whose help is 
most needed as the enemy."

  [Text] Yan Zhixiang, deputy director of the Civil Aviation 
General Administration of China, today called on the civil 
aviation industry to bring about an improvement in safety in 
1994 and to put a stop to serious flight accidents. 
  Yan Zhixiang made the above remarks at today's national work 
conference on civil aviation's flight safety. He said this year 
the character "strictness" will be emphasized in civil 
aviation's safety work. He called for practising strict 
management, for formulating strict rules and standards, for 
strict enforcement of discipline, and for applying the character 
of "strictness" in all areas of the civil aviation work. Under 
the condition of a fierce market competition, he called on all 
to guard against the tendency of only paying attention to 
development to the neglect of safety; to overcome the tendency 
of stressing production management to the neglect of safety; to 
overcome the tendency of stressing efficiency to the neglect of 
safety; and to give safety top priority at all time. 
  Yan Zhixiang pointed out the need to adopt resolute 
organizational measures against units which are poorly managed, 
which are poorly led, and which are beset with serious safety 
problems and to sternly call to account the leaders of those 
units. In the future, he said, one of the main criteria for 
evaluating and promoting cadres should be made to evaluate their 
attaching importance to the safety work and to their ability to 
do a good safety work.

<F P=106> [By reporter Shao Ling (6730 7227): "Mainland China Plans </F>
to Open Its Gold Market to the Outside World"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 16 Feb (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--When 
Shanghai and Guangzhou actively seek central government approval 
for setting up gold exchanges, the relevant department in China 
plans to offer tenders to foreign firms for exploring gold mines 
in various areas on the mainland. According to information that 
we have received, Beijing has already established a special 
office to oversee the organization and coordination of importing 
overseas funds and technology to develop gold resources. As of 
this moment, more than 10 companies from the countries and 
regions such as the United States, Canada, South Africa, and 
Australia have expressed interest. 
  In recent years, along with the improvement in the people's 
living standard, more and more people have begun to pay 
attention to fashion and appearance, so gold jewelry has become 
popular in various areas on the mainland. Shanghai has many 
gold jewelry shops and has become an important gold market; like 
Guangzhou and Shenzhen, it has already proposed the 
establishment of a standardized gold exchange. In the 1930's, 
Shanghai was the largest gold trading center in the Far East, 
and its transaction volume ranked it third in the world, just 
behind London and New York. After the 1950's, for various 
reasons, Shanghai's gold market ceased operating, but since 
1982, when the mainland restored internal sales of gold jewelry, 
the number of gold jewelry shops in Shanghai rose to over 250. 
In 1992, Shanghai sold 15 tonnes of gold jewelry, and the money 
involved was about 1.7 billion yuan, a 50 percent increase over 
1991; in the first half of 1993, it sold 14.5 tonnes of gold 
jewelry (the volume of sales in the whole country was 250 
tonnes), and the money involved was 1.87 billion yuan, ranking 
Shanghai first in the country in terms of sales volume and 
making it the largest gold market in China. 
  For the past four decades, however, gold production 
activities and operations in China has always been under 
centralized state control, and the People's Bank of China has 
set the buying and selling prices of gold and has monopolized 
purchase activities and operations. Judging from the year of 
the lowest purchase price of gold on the mainland in the past 
decade, the price was less than 50 percent of the gold price in 
the international community, but the bank's selling price was 
30-40 percent higher than the international gold price. The 
distorted gold price on the mainland has led to an increase in 
the industrial production cost of gold, as well as a decrease in 
returns; thus, gold mines and factories have lost money year 
after year and the problems of gold smuggling and the drain on 
gold resources have become quite serious. Because the black 
market price of gold is 120-140 yuan per gram, the amount of 
gold smuggled in accounts for two-thirds of the nongovernmental 
output of gold in the whole country, whereas the gold purchased 
by the state accounts for less than one-third of the output in 
the nongovernmental sector. 
  For example, in the first half of 1993, due to the state's 
low purchasing price for gold as well as the effect of black 
market gold transactions, the state's purchased volume of gold 
dropped sharply, representing a 57 percent decrease from the 
same period in 1992. 
  In order to revitalize the gold market on the mainland, last 
August the People's Bank of China once again announced an 
adjustment of the purchase price for gold, basing it on the 
price of gold in London. Customers may use yuan, which is 
calculated according to the exchange rate at the foreign 
exchange swap center at any specific moment, to pay for gold 
jewelry. At the same time, the purchase price of gold was 
increased from 54 yuan per gram to 96 yuan per gram; the 
corresponding dealer price of gold was increased to 107.68 yuan 
per gram, and it was made clear that the price would be flexibly 
adjusted in the future according to changes in the international 
price of gold and the exchange rate of the yuan. As a result, 
the gold output volume in the second half of the year rebounded, 
and annual output increased 7.5 percent over that of 1992. 
  China has not officially announced its gold output, which 
has 
only been revealed by newspapers and magazines. Over the past 
14 years, output has increased five times, among which the gold 
excavation volume in the nongovernmental sector was 400,000 
liang [one liang equals 50 grams] last year. People believe that 
the output of state-run gold mines should exceed this number. 
At present, the government's gold reserve is 400 tonnes, and 
the gold volume in the nongovernmental sector also comes close 
to 400 tonnes; thus, it suffices to form a gold market with some 
scale. According to information we have received, in recent 
years, the southern parts of Shandong Peninsula have discovered 
26 gold mines, which have commercial exploration potential. If 
advanced technology can be brought in from the United States, 
Canada, and South Africa, gold production on the mainland has 
great prospects. Guangzhou and Shanghai are fighting for the 
establishment of gold exchanges, to carry out gold futures 
trading, and this will promote convergence of the mainland's 
gold market with the international gold market, so that 
gradually the gold price will be commercialized, and the market 
will be internationalized.

  [Text] At the provincial overseas enterprise work 
conference that concluded today, Vice Governor Wang Zongzhang 
put forward the medium- and long-term targets of overseas 
investment. These targets include completely restructuring and 
optimizing the overall layout of overseas investment by the end 
of this century to establish an initial network of overseas 
enterprises that cover the major markets of the six continents, 
are based on complementary economies, are of a fairly large 
scale, and have substantial strength and their own 
characteristics; to gradually transform the existing overseas 
enterprises into conglomerations or shareholding enterprises on 
the premise of voluntary participation and mutual benefits and 
turn them into modern enterprises developing diverse business 
while emphasizing a major trade; and to continuously expand the 
channels of foreign economic relations and trade, transmit, and 
exchange the information on the markets at home and abroad; and 
expand the economic strength and the scale to serve 
Heilongjiang's development of an open economy. 
  Since 1984 when Heilongjiang established its first overseas 
enterprise in Hong Kong, the province had established 450 
various types of enterprises overseas by the end of 1993, thus 
enabling its export commodities to enjoy a long and stable share 
in the world market and to promote the implementation of the 
strategy of diversifying the market. Due to a lack of 
understanding and overall guidance, however, the overseas 
enterprises have yet to fully develop their role. In view of 
this, Wang Zongzhang pointed out: To attain the medium- and 
long-term targets of overseas investment, the investment to be 
made overseas in the near future should be rearranged and 
distributed in a rational way and group companies or outlets 
with substantial strength should be established. In the next 
two to three years, about 10 large group companies should be 
established to develop transnational business and gradually 
achieve internationalization in business. The group companies 
established in developed countries should focus on imports of 
funds, technology, equipment, and modern managerial expertise 
and mastery of the trends in the international market and the 
world economy to provide favorable conditions for Heilongjiang 
to optimize the mix and the quality of its export commodities 
and achieve a larger share in the world market. The group 
companies established in developing countries should focus on 
the sectors that these countries and Heilongjiang can use to 
supplement and suit each other to expand the channels for the 
sales of Heilongjiang's export commodities. Enterprises 
established overseas should be integrated with the international 
practice and establish a managerial mechanism that meets the 
need of the modern market economy. Shareholding companies 
should be established on the basis of voluntary participation 
and mutual benefits. They should not only encourage the 
existing overseas enterprises to buy shares but also absorb the 
domestic and foreign funds, as well as the funds from in and 
outside the province. The enterprises established overseas 
should diversify their business while emphasizing a major trade. 
Guided by the demand of the international market and relying on 
Heilongjiang's advantages in resources, industries, and 
geographical position, they should develop production, trade, 
banking, technology, and service businesses to gradually become 
large multi-purpose industrial groups. Meanwhile, they should 
build bonded warehouses in the key areas of international 
transportation, as long as they are economical and convenient 
and help promote sales.

  [Text] On 23 February, the Fuxin City Intermediate 
People's Court passed judgment on a bribery case involving (Wang 
Yunling), former director of the Fuxin City Goods and Materials 
Bureau. (Wang Yunling) was sentenced to death with a two-year 
reprieve and was deprived of his political rights for life. 
  As announced by the Fuxin City Intermediate People's Court, 
the accused (Wang Yunling) took advantage of the preparations by 
the Fuxin City Goods and Materials Bureau and the agency of the 
Hong Kong Transportation and Trade Corporation in Guangzhou to 
extablish a joint corporation to accept bribes of 150,000 yuan 
in Renminbi and 15,000 yuan in Hong Kong dollars on four 
occasions from April to November 1992. In another instance, 
when the Fuxin City Goods and Materials Bureau was compensated 
for the the right to use state-owned land, (Wang Yunling) 
accepted bribes of 100,000 yuan in Renminbi from Shenyang 
(Mulan) Corporation in March 1993. 
  In October 1993, when details of the case were revealed, 
(Wang Yunling) showed repentance for his crime, frankly 
confessed to details that had not been ferreted out by judicial 
organizations, and returned all the illicit money.

  [Text] Dhaka, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier

the political, economic and cultural fields have developed 
steadily under the guidance of the five principles of peaceful 
co-existence thanks to the joint efforts made by both 
governments and peoples. 
  It is the set policy of the Chinese Government to strengthen 
the existing friendly ties with Bangladesh, the Chinese foreign 
minister said. 
  "I am looking forward to exchanging views with leaders of 
Bangladesh on bilateral relations and international issues of 
mutual interest so as to increase mutual understanding, deepen 
friendship, expand cooperation and promote the further 
consolidation and development of the friendly relations existing 
between Bangladesh and China", he added.

Teng-hui with unidentified correspondents at Taoyuan Chiang 
Kai-shek International Airport on 16 February; first two 
paragraphs are editor's note] 
  [Text] Upon returning from eight-day unofficial visits to 
three Southeast Asian nations on 16 February, President Li 
Teng-hui immediately held a news conference at the CKS [Chiang 
Kai-shek] International Airport. During a span of 80 minutes, 
President Li answered 30 questions from Chinese and foreign 
correspondents in a tone of optimism and firmness coupled with 
plenty of gestures and vivid comparisons. In answering 
questions, President Li stressed that the world has moved toward 
a new era of regional cooperation and economic sovereignty after 
the Cold War and that the Republic of China [ROC] would make 
efforts in the three directions of peace, cooperation, and 
prosperity to strive for the development and stability of Asia 
as a whole. 
  The following is the full text of President Li's opening 
address, as well as his answers at the news conference: 
  President Li said: This unofficial trip served several main 
purposes. We deeply understand that at present, after the end 
of the Cold War, the international situation, especially the 
international economic situation, has gradually shifted toward 
regional cooperation. The further establishment of regional 
economic relations under these circumstances is a matter of 
great importance. There should be an exchange of views between 
the leaders of countries in the Asian region and the Republic of 
China [ROC] with regard to the various countries' conditions and 
their attitudes toward what the ROC thinks and does. This will 
be a great help to us. During my eight-day vacation trip, there 
were many difficulties caused by the absence of diplomatic 
relations. Despite these circumstances, after talking with and 
hearing the officials' views, especially from the leaders of the 
three countries, my conclusion is that the visit has yielded 
fairly good results. It is very important for our efforts to 
further establish relations of multilateral economic cooperation 
in the Asian region in the future. 
  Through our current visit, we can see that all countries' 
views, sentiments, and respects to the ROC in Taiwan are more 
than we can imagine at home. This is a very happy thing. We 
should be grateful to the three leaders for their hospitality. 
  One thing for which I feel sorry about this trip is my not 
being able to call on Chinese residents in each country, as we 
had to respect the host countries' arrangements. In Indonesia, 
I, in an unofficial manner, invited representatives of local 
Chinese residents to the place where we stayed to exchange views 
with them and understand their problems, hoping that we could 
find a way to solve the problems. In Bangkok, however, we were 
unable to listen to the local Chinese residents' problems. Here 
I would like to express our regret to the Chinese residents of 
these three countries. 
  Our country's further development must be separated from 
ideology, with efforts being made in the directions of peace, 
cooperation, and prosperity. Although we met with uncalled for 
disturbances during our trip to the three countries, we did not 
consider them as very serious problems. We are convinced that 
the whole world will gradually understand that the ROC is a 
progressive country, a country which helps other countries, and 
a peace-loving country. Our endeavors do not reflect different 
opinions toward any region or country, including Communist 
China. Our efforts to help the mainland's development and our 
efforts to help the progress and development of Southeast Asia 
are all the same. We are ready to help the Asian region achieve 
development with Taiwan's experience. This is our wish and 
expectation. 
  I am really grateful to you, ladies and gentlemen, for 
attending this news conference at such a late hour. I hope all 
of you will raise as many questions as you can. I will make my 
answers short so that everyone will have a chance to ask 
questions. I thank you all, thank you. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, you have repeatedly mentioned 
and stressed pragmatic diplomacy, that existence would bring 
development, and that the ROC should have its own place in the 
international community before reunification. In your visits to 
the three countries this time, have you achieved indirect 
results in realizing pragmatic diplomacy and fundamentally 
facilitating return to the United Nations? 

    [Li] Pragmatic diplomacy is completely based on discussions 
on economic cooperation. This trip prompted the Chinese 
Communists' protests against many countries, but these countries 
are all very pragmatic. In spite of the Chinese Communists' 
repeated protests, they, being ready to make friends with the 
ROC, maintained an unequivocal attitude, knowing the ROC is a 
peace-loving and free nation. 
  As to the question of what actual benefits would pragmatic 
diplomacy bring to our foreign affairs, I think that the 
benefits to foreign relations through the current visit cannot 
be seen in the short term. We must take a long-term view and 
make contacts with many countries. Only then will we be able to 
see results. 
  [Correspondent] In your opinion, in what way should Chinese 
all over the world look at your trip? 
  [Li] We don't have a political agenda for my visits to the 
three countries this time. Everyone should realize that the ROC 
on Taiwan must develop. It is safe to say that the ROC is a 
country of a divided China [zhong hua min guo zai tai wan shi 
zhong guo fen lie zhong de guo jia 0022 5478 3046 0948 0961 0669 
3494 2508 0022 0948 0433 5933 0022 4104 0948 1367]. The whole 
world should realize that a unified China is a goal we will 
attain in the future. However, at present the reality is that 
China is divided. As a divided country under separate rule, we 
should set the direction for our own development. This will 
create greater room for reunification across the strait in the 
future. Chinese all over the world should not approach this 
visit from a political point of view, regarding it as something 
that was intended to create one China, one Taiwan, or two 
Chinas. There is no need to see the visit in this way, and 
quite obviously, that was impossible. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, your trip to Southeast Asia 
this time could be described as quite successful and very 
fruitful. Will you make further overseas trips in the same 
manner in the future? What countries or regions will be under 
consideration should there be any similar trips? 
  [Li] As I have mentioned in my speeches on New Year's Day 
and on Lunar New Year's eve, this may be a year the ROC will 
develop a new direction for its international relations. 
Besides, I feel that it is necessary to somehow make the 
mainland understand this issue so that they can deal with it 
more pragmatically. Today is just 16 February, there is so much 
time left in the year. I think I will visit countries with 
which we have formal diplomatic ties and countries with which we 
do not have formal diplomatic ties. It is too early now to say 
which countries I plan to visit. We will let you know after 
every preparation has been made. This is the way such matters 
should be handled. 
  [Correspondent] Your meetings during this overseas trip with 
the heads of state of the three countries without diplomatic 
ties with us constitutes a major diplomatic breakthrough, but 
the Indonesian foreign minister said today that the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation [APEC] conference scheduled to be held in 
that country this year will follow the Seattle model established 
in the United States last year, meaning that you may not be able 
to attend the conference in person. How are we going to resolve 
this long-standing diplomatic situation on our side? 
  [Li] The United States established a model at the APEC 
conference in Seattle last November, but it is hard to say 
whether this model will be followed in the future. Therefore, 
although the foreign minister of this year's host country, 
Indonesia, wants to keep the model, future developments remain 
to be seen. Provided we keep on trying hard again and again in 
the future, the host country's attitude should eventually 
change. Moreover, clearly put, are there other people who 
understand the development of the Asian economic situation more 
than the ROC does? This is not an issue that can be solved 
within a short period of time, but I believe the future will be 
very bright. 

    [Correspondent] Hsu Chia-tun [Xu Jiatun], former director of 
Communist China's XINHUA Hong Kong branch, said in his memoirs 
that the Communist Chinese leaders will not approve of Taiwan's 
recent active maneuver for international recognition, which they 
consider an action for independence in disguise. Such an 
attitude on the part of Communist Chinese leaders is bound to 
affect your unofficial trips abroad. What are your 
countermeasures for dealing with the attitude of Communist 
Chinese hierarchy? 
  [Li] Is this the attitude of the leaders on the mainland? 
How are their unity and cooperation as compared to ours? As is 
known to all, the communists sometimes use very strong rhetoric 
in speeches targeted at others, which actually does not reflect 
the internal view. 
  Moreover, what is Hsu Chia-tun's status? In my opinion, he 
belonged to the third-generation leaders, about the same age as 
Hu Yao-pang [Hu Yaobang] and Chao Tzu-yang [Zhao Ziyang]. Since 
he went to the United States later, what category of people does 
his mentality and view represent? How reliable is he? It is 
very difficult to judge the trend on the mainland based on his 
memoirs? His memoirs may reflect the view of some Communist 
Chinese leaders, especially those of the older generation with a 
strong ideology. Is this the consensus among the Chinese 
Communists? We do not quite understand his view. 
  [Correspondent] Economic cooperation is the development 
trend of all Asian countries today. When you met the heads of 
states of the three nations, did you mention any plans for 
economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region, such as 
cooperation with the ASEAN and Malaysia? 
  [Li] Despite different national conditions and demands, all 
Asian countries will ultimately depend on foreign countries for 
markets. Japan and the four small dragons are currently the 
economically better off countries in Asia. However, assistance 
from a few foreign countries will not be adequate for helping 
one become well off. This is an all-inclusive issue. 
Cooperation with every foreign country will be helpful and our 
assistance to others will also be useful. 
  Discussions with these three countries about mutual 
assistance did take place. For example, we discussed with the 
Philippines the question of signing an agreement on establishing 
free trade zones. ASEAN states are maneuvering to establish free 
trade zones. However, it remains difficult to predict the 
outcome. Ramos and I talked about this question and viewed it 
beneficial to both countries. Further discussions will be needed 
to decide whether this question should involve the ASEAN states. 
As for Indonesia and Thailand, we also discussed the question 
of developing bilateral trade. The ROC's experiences will be 
helpful for these countries. We view this quesion with an 
all-inclusive approach. 
  [Correspondent] Despite Communist China's strong protests 
against your trip, the Philippines and two other countries have 
emphasized that it does not violate their "One-China" policy. 
Will this become a new diplomatic pattern, and how will it 
affect the future development of cross-strait relations? 
  [Li] It will not have any effect. I believe that Communist 
China arbitrarily lodged protests time and again, probably 
because some of its functionaries, who are ignorant of world 
trends, wanted to win praises from their State Council by 
lodging protests to prevent Li Teng-hui's visit to these 
countries. However, such a way of doing things is very immature 
and childish. 
  In my view, there is no need to worry about this issue. We 
will continue to maintain relations with the mainland. The focus 
of cross-strait relations in the future should be laid on 
searching for ways to strengthen mutual trust, so as to let the 
Chinese Communists understand what is beneficial to them, and we 
will not do what is not beneficial to them. I urge all of you 
not to take this issue too seriously. The ROC is a mature 
country. 

    [Correspondent] You visited many places during your 
eight-day tour of Southeast Asia. Which of them left the most 
profound impression on you? Which of them is worth our using 
its experience as a reference? 
  [Li] Whenever I visited a country, I paid close attention to 
its conditions, people's living standards, markets, houses, 
farmland, and the availability of water. I am very much 
concerned about these matters. We must not look down upon the 
developing countries as backward just because the ROC has 
achieved considerable successes on Taiwan over the past four 
decades or so. Each ASEAN member has its own strong points and 
shortcomings. For instance, having taken a look at Indonesia's 
plan for the cultivation of mangrove woods, I found we are much 
backward than others in this field of endeavor. Groundwater in 
many of our localities has a high saline content. To date, no 
one has come up with a very good plan to make improvement. 
However, Indonesia has already made efforts to plant mangrove 
woods and to use them to absorb saline content and to prevent 
the increase of saline content in groundwater. It may look like 
an insignificant matter, but it shows there are quite a lot that 
we must learn. 
  In fact, due to different environments and problems, the 
people in many places have their own methods of struggle. Many 
of them are worth our learning. Instead of offering what one 
has onsidedly, the so-called cooperation should have both sides 
learn from and coordinate with each other. This is real 
cooperation. Likewise, we should look upon a number of 
countries in a "relative," instead of "absolute," attitude, and 
should thus learn from each other. 
  [Correspondent] During your foreign visit, there were 
different reports on the so-called "westward" and "southward" 
overseas investment. What is your attitude toward our country's 
investment policy? 
  [Li] The ROC's future economic development depends on its 
overseas investment. This is because Taiwan itself does not 
have enough economic resources. We are one of Asia's "four 
little dragons." Statistics on our investment in ASEAN 
countries, Mainland China, and North Korea -- countries which 
are less developed than the ROC -- reveal an interesting 
phenomenon: the more our businesses invest in a country, the 
greater the volume of trade we have with it. Thus, investment 
increases trade. We touched many of these issues in a 
conference on Asia's trade prospects last year. 
  We believe we should not approach things with a suspicious 
glance. This includes the so-called "westward" and "southward" 
policies. The most important thing for the ROC is to increase 
its international investment; economic relations and trade are 
vitally important to us. From this point of view, the 
government has no problem with the so-called "westward" and 
"southward" policies. 
  [Correspondent] Your unofficial visit to the three Southeast 
Asian countries, called ice-breaking journey by some people, was 
quite successful. Our country's status and your prestige and 
achievements in agricultural and economic areas have been 
affirmed in those countries. It is believed that the trip will 
contribute considerably to advancing our diplomacy, particularly 
economic and trade diplomacy. How will the visit affect your 
political life? Could you describe your state of mind and the 
changes it has gone through? 
  [Li] During my visit to the three countries, particularly 
Indonesia, many people called me Dr. Li or Prof. Li. This was 
simply because many people, whether government ministers or 
business leaders, knew that Li Teng-hui accomplished something 
in the academic world and in agricultural reform. They knew 
what I did was quite successful. 
  These countries hope that we will offer them good advice and 
help them in this regard. I am quite willing to do so, because 
it is a meaningful thing to do. Further, this will help us 
forge closer ties with them. 
  In my talks with Indonesian President Suharto, for example, 
70 percent of the questions he raised were on the issue of 
dealing with high unemployment rate in a country where the 
population is growing at 2.5 percent a year and on ways to 
provide appropriate jobs to the unemployed. Seeing that 
President Suharto showed great concern about this issue and was 
pleased with my answers, I immediately called Taipei by phone to 
send two sets of my three books to him to read. 
  I feel it is very significant that my work in the academic 
work is respected by people. Whether it is an achievement or 
not, I will be very happy if anything I did is beneficial to the 
country. 
  My state of mind has not changed. I would feel very good if 
I, at my age and with the last flames of a burning candle, could 
help improve the life of ordinary citizens and enable them to 
live peacefully in the country. 

    [Correspondent] What is the biggest gain of your current 
trip? What is your mood now? How many points have you scored 
in your current trip? 
  [Li] It is not nice for me to grade myself. Right now I am 
very happy. Before my trip to Bangkok, the mass media 
speculated whether I would meet with the king of Thailand. In 
fact, my meeting with the Thai king had been arranged in advance. 
  Leaders in the whole world have a common view. Politically, 
it is necessary to have democracy; and economically, it is 
necessary to practice market economy, centering on the market. 
The communist and socialist countries also advocate market 
economy and freedom of market. Since leaders of the whole world 
have this view, it is quite easy to promote mutual understanding 
among leaders of the world. If leaders of the world hold more 
meetings and talks, there will be only some small-scale 
conflicts and a world war will not happen. Therefore, I am 
convinced that the civil war in Yugoslavia will not touch off a 
world war. 
  [Correspondent] Would you tell us whether you have another 
plan to go abroad within one or two years? If you go abroad 
again, where do you want to go the most. 
  [Li] The country I would like to visit most is the United 
States. As I just said, this is a secret which does not need to 
be mentioned. Whether the United States or the United Kingdom, 
France, Germany, and Japan, I think I want to visit all those 
countries. If there are opportunities, the U.S. President, the 
Japanese prime minister, the British prime minister, and the 
French president may all come to hold talks. Although Taiwan is 
very small, the talks may offer some help to the world. There 
are many people with whom I want to talk to. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, you have met with heads of 
states of the three countries in your trip. Are we going to set 
up a trans-ministerial organization to promote the development 
of bilateral economic relations with those countries? How will 
investment in those countries by plants and enterprises of our 
country be protected? 
  [Li] In fact, the issue of investment in the Philippines and 
Indonesia is well known at home. What the public has not 
noticed are plans for rural development. As to how we will use 
our experience of agricultural development to economically help 
those countries, we have also made plans. We will examine this 
matter later and I will ask Secretary General Tsiang Yien-shi to 
take charge of the matter. When public and private enterprises 
make investment in the three countries in the future, our 
government will encourage and do its best to assist them. 

    [Correspondent] Having visited the Philippines and 
Indonesia, 
do you find their investment environments truly suitable to 
Taiwan businesses? Do you not feel it is more important to 
improve our domestic investment environment than helping our 
businesses invest abroad? 
  [Li] There are no conflicts between improving our domestic 
investment environment and investing overseas. The only problem 
is where to spend the money. For the nongovernmental sector, 
this is a question of capital distribution. Investment 
direction differs from one country to another. Financially, we 
have not yet reached the difficult stage of choosing between the 
two. 
  We should realize why many businesses have invested in 
public 
undertakings in Indonesia. Indonesia produces a lot of energy. 
The ROC cannot advance and develop if it does not have a 
guaranteed source of energy supplies. Investing in Indonesia is 
a long-term national policy and absolutely necessary. Investing 
in that country is out of the need of our long-term national 
development. It is not the same thing as setting up a few small 
plants, like some other countries did. In the nongovernment 
sector, labor-intensive industries in our country will be 
replaced by investment in hi-tech industries. Therefore, there 
will be no problems of capital distribution. 
  [Correspondent] The academic circles generally feel our 
foreign policy and mainland policy should complement each other. 
In your view, how can the two supplement each other? 
  [Li] Our foreign policy proceeds from pragmatic diplomacy. 
Our mainland policy aims at promoting mutual trust across the 
strait. The two have no conflicts with each other. It is not 
necessary to view many issues, such as negotiations with the 
mainland, from an ideological perspective. The mainland should 
realize that it must not approach ideological issues with a 
"fatherly" mentality. 
  I must reiterate that the pursuit of peace, progress, and 
prosperity is a worldwide trend. A successful diplomacy will 
become an important chip in our mainland policy. The two can 
supplement each other. 
  [Correspondent] Did you discuss the question of Afro-Asian 
economic and security system with leaders of the three countries 
during your Southeast Asian tour? 
  [Li] The question of Asian regional security system was not 
discussed. It does not help things to talk about how to fight 
as soon as you meet someone whom you have not come to know too 
well. The establishment of a specific security system should 
proceed from economic cooperation. Exchange of views on this 
will come next. The military aspect should not be made an 
important element. 
  [Correspondent] In your view, has your vacationing journey 
helped upgrade our relations with the ASEAN countries, the 
principle goal of your trip? When you attend the APEC summit 
next time, will you be as relaxed and confident as you play golf? 
  [Li] I am not confident of that. Making friends is not that 
easy, nor is it that fast. We must go slow in making friends. 
Take last year's APEC summit in the United States for example. 
The U.S. President and other people all hoped I would not 
attend. What would the outcome have been if I had insisted on 
attending it? We must not let others misunderstand. We must 
make all countries and people in the world respect the ROC. We 
must make them view the ROC as an extraordinary country. This 
was why I said then that I did not want to attend, lest people 
blame us for destroying the summit's atmosphere. 
  Making friends requires five or six get-togethers to become 
truly good friends. This is also true in the case of countries. 
Between friends, some of the things must be done in an 
appropriate environment. For example, in an appropriate 
environment, I will ask the good friend: If you all can attend, 
why can't I? In this way, many things can be resolved at the 
right time. 

    [Correspondent] Mr. President, what is your impression of 
the leaders of the three countries you visited? 
  [Li] The leaders of the three countries I visited this time, 
including the king of Thailand, are all very intelligent and 
wise. They all have deep understanding of the local situations 
of their respective countries. For instance, Indonesian 
President Suharto has been president for 25 years and people 
think he always lives in his villa; but he knows the countryside 
very well and also has a clear understanding of the Republic of 
China. 
  Our current trip has enabled us to understand that many 
leaders in the world not only understand their domestic issues 
but also show concern for international issues. The leaders of 
the three countries have seen many good points of our Republic 
of China. I respect them very much and our talks were very 
harmonious. They understood what I said and I also understood 
what they said. I admired them very much. 
  [Correspondent] Following your visit to Singapore five years 
ago as "President Li from Taiwan," you made a famous remark: 
"Although not satisfactory but acceptable." During the current 
visit to the ASEAN countries, some people addressed you as 
Professor Li or Doctor Li although you represented the Republic 
of China in going abroad. In promoting pragmatic diplomacy in 
the future, how do you plan to make the Republic of China more 
dignified? Besides, since you can happily hold talks with 
leaders of the ASEAN countries, why can't the leaders of the two 
sides of the strait sit down to talk in a calm manner? 
  [Li] This is a very difficult question. I am not 
criticizing them, but I think, among leaders of the whole world, 
the leaders of Communist China are most stubborn and ideological. 
  It is impossible for us to ask Communist China to forsake 
one 
country and two systems. Under such circumstances, the best way 
is to act and they will naturally recognize the fact. 
  China is in a situation of split. It is no mistake that a 
country needs respect. Some people invited me to dinner and 
addressed me as "Professor Li" and "Doctor Li." They were very 
innocent and I would not scold them. I think they have their 
difficulty in their stand toward the Republic of China. 
However, we should understand that the dignity of a country 
does not rest with addressing me "His Excellency the Eighth 
President of the Republic of China." Whether others think 
highly or not of the circumstances and position of our country 
-- this is the area, I believe, on which we should focus our 
efforts. We should be more united and work harder, and not 
think too highly of ourselves. Don't engage in "promiscuous" 
and improper acts just because we have tens of billions of 
dollars in our hands. We should win others' respect with our 
culture and moral standards. 
  I am very willing to do more things for the country if there 
is an opportunity. However, things between our side and the 
mainland are very difficult before the time is ripe, and 
according to our judgment the situation on the mainland is not 
very satisfactory. I will study the question you mentioned in 
the future. 
  [Correspondent] At present foreign policy lays stress on 
economic affairs. Mr. President, how shall we assist our 
domestic enterprises to develop transnational enterprises? 
  [Li] I have discussed this question with Minister Chien. As 
conditions differ from country to country, the approach we take 
should also be different. In the future, we should examine more 
carefully the repesentatives and personnel we send to those 
countries, for it is not helpful if the personnel we send do not 
understand the conditions of those countries. 
  Now, in addition to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
other 
units, even the Academia Sinica will actively discuss those 
issues. I will ask the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to make an 
overall examination. 

    [Correspondent] Taiwan's businesses have made considerable 
investment in Southeast Asia. Mr. President, are there any 
specific guarantees or measures for encouraging Taiwan's 
business circles to invest there? 
  [Li] The number one concern among Taiwan businessmen in 
Indonesia and other areas is, I believe, their children's 
education, including how to build schools, hiring of teachers 
and principals, and curriculum. While in Indonesia, I invited 
four representatives of a friendship association. The 
government will address the questions they raised. They all 
hold ROC passports and we should help them solve their 
difficulties. 
  We have $15 billion investment in Southeast Asia. This 
amount of money has been put into circulation, but we don't have 
a financial center to provide assistance. How goods flow into 
Southeast Asia and back to our country? We will ask Chairman 
Hsiao of the Council for Economic Planning and Development to 
study these issues. In short, we will simultaneously formulate 
measures in regard to education, banking services, freight 
trade, and so forth. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, during your trip to Southeast 
Asia, did you invite, face to face, the leaders of the 
Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand to visit our country? Will 
exchange of high-level visits with Southeast Asian countries 
become a regular, routine event in the future? 
  [Li] I did not raise this question during the meeting with 
Thai King Phumiphon. As for the two other leaders, I officially 
invited them and their responses were very good. They certainly 
responded, by nodding their heads. We were extending an 
invitation; it certainly would look awful if they did not make 
any response, like nodding their heads. (laughter burst out 
throughout the hall) 
  [Correspondent] During the trip, you emphasized promoting 
regional peace and economic prosperity in Southeast Asia on the 
basis of progress, prosperity, and peace. Some countries in 
Southeast Asia are set against one another over the issue of 
sovereignty of South China Sea. In your talks with the leaders 
of Southeast Asian nations, did you raise the possibility of 
using Taiwan's southern policy as a basis for a peaceful 
solution to the East China Sea sovereignty issue among the 
Southeast Asian nations so that they can jointly develop the 
resources of South China Sea? 
  [Li] Your question coincides with my long-term view. I 
plan to raise this issue during my second or third meeting with 
them. I tried as much as possible not to raise sensitive issues 
during the first meetings. Because the meeting time was 
limited, sensitive issues would have made them uneasy and not 
want to see me again. I certainly would raise this issue at a 
second or third meeting. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, you care about the aviation 
and space industries a lot. During the trip, you visited the 
aircraft plant in Bandung, Indonesia. Are we going to cooperate 
with Indonesia or are we going to jointly develop aircraft with 
Indonesia, Europe, and the United States? Will our country's 
Hanhsiang Company take part in such a cooperation arrangement? 
What is your assessment? 
  [Li] I asked a lot of questions when I visited the aircraft 
plant in Bandung. I asked questions about the plant's 
operations, management, and sales. But I did not suggest 
cooperation. Why? I know the problems we have. They did not 
say anything about their problems, but I can understand. 
  As for whether cooperation with Indonesia is possible, 
because all the planes they produce are for commercial use. 
[sentence as published] Indonesia has over 17,000 islands, 
planes are needed for transportation. The plant's monthly 
output of planes is about 170. Buying a plane is different 
from buying a car. It takes a lot of money to purchase a plane. 
Where will the money come from? Problems like these are many. 
  For this reason, I have asked Mr. Ku Lien-sung of the China 
Trust Corporation to make an assessment, to examine all those 
relevant issues including operations, management, loans, and so 
forth. The Hanhsiang Company has not been officially founded 
yet. There are still difficulties in this regard. We will try 
to get a better understanding of the situation. I boarded one 
of their helicopters. It wasn't bad at all. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, in your opinion, will your 
unofficial visits to the three Southeast Asian countries help in 
the ROC's bid to join the United Nations? 
  [Li] If the road to the United Nations is 100-km long, we 
have covered only one meter. So we have to continue working 
harder and harder. If we do not try harder, no country would 
help us. If we work hard, even some big countries will help us 
in the future.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 23 (CNA) -- A three-member American 
delegation headed by Dorothy Dwoskin, an assistant U.S. trade 
representative [USTR], arrived in Taipei Wednesday for tariff 
reduction talks with Taiwan officials. 
  Dwoskin made no statement at Chiang Kai-shek International 
Airport. 
  Progress in the talks, which will begin Thursday at the head 
office of the state-run Taiwan Power Company, is expected to 
help Taiwan's bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT), government sources said. 
  The talks will focus on Taiwan's tariff rates on 699 
industrial and agricultural products, which U.S. negotiators 
hope to see slashed in half. The U.S. is also seeking caps on 
tariffs to keep them at or below 10 percent for industrial 
products and 20 percent for agricultural goods. 
  The two sides failed to reach an agreement on tariff cuts 
during talks in Washington last month. Vice Economic Affairs 
Minister Sheu Ke-sheng said earlier this month that the 
government will first cut tariffs on 252 industrial items by an 
average of 17.5 percent and on 154 agricultural products by an 
average of 12.5 percent. 
  Sheu will head the Taiwan delegation for this round of 
talks, 
which will last through Saturday. 
  Trade officials said discussions will include bringing 
tariffs on more than 8,000 items in line with GATT requirements. 
  Taiwan applied to join GATT in 1990 as a separate customs 
territory and is expected to be admitted to the Geneva-based 
world trade requlatory body by the end of this year.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 24 (CNA) -- The Taoyuan District 
prosecutors' office Wednesday [23 February] indicted a Mainland 
Chinese couple for hijacking a mainland civil airliner to Taiwan 
late last year. 
  In his indictment, the prosecutor recommended a 12-year 
sentence for Luo Changhua, 38, and eight years for his wife Wang 
Yuying, 34, for violations of the Civil Aviation Law. 
  The couple, along with their 11-year-old child Luo Wanghuan, 
hijacked a Fujian Airlines airliner to Taiwan on its way from 
Ganzhou to Chengdu on Dec. 28, 1993. The child was placed in 
the care of Luo's relatives in Taiwan. 
  The prosecutor said he recommended shorter sentences because 
they had surrendered themselves upon landing at the Chiang 
Kai-shek International Airport. 
  Ten civil air flights from Mainland China were hijacked to 
Taiwan in 1993.

  [Text] Hong Kong, February 23 (XINHUA) -- Nearly 60 percent 
of the members of Hong Kong's 19 district boards (DB) issued a 
joint statement Tuesday [22 February], calling on Governor Chris 
Patten to withdraw his political bill already tabled to the 
Legislative Council. 
  The statement was signed by 256 of the 441 members of the 19 
district boards, including the chairmen of 18 district boards. 
  The signatories said in the statement, "we sincerely ask the 
governor to take back his political bill already tabled to the 
Legislative Council so that the Sino-British talks can be 
resumed." 
  As a result of the termination of the Sino-British talks, 
they said, the membership of the three-tier councils can not 
straddle 1997. "This would harm Hong Kong's stable transition 
and the smooth transfer of power in 1997, we are deeply 
concerned about that," they said. 
  "For the sake of stability and prosperity of Hong Kong in 
the 
future," the DB members said, "we hope for an early resumption 
of Sino-British talks to reach an agreement." 
  The origin of the statement is to be presented to Governor 
Chris Patten, while its copies will be submitted to Chinese Vice 
Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and his British 
counterpart Douglas Richard HUrd as well as other Chinese and 
British officials concerned.

<F P=106> [By Louis Ng, So Lai-fun, and Linda Choy] </F>
  [Text] The Legislative Council early this morning approved 
the first part of Governor Chris Patten's proposals for 
electoral reform, changing only the title of the bill but 
fending off two attempts to block it. The final vote was taken 
at 0120, at the end of more than nine hours of debate and a 
marathon session of voting forced by the council's complicated 
Standing Orders. 
  Councillors overwhelmingly approved, with only a few 
dissenting voices, granting Hong Kong's 18-year-olds the vote, 
adopt the single-seat, single-vote system for all elections, put 
an end to the system of appointing members in district boards 
and municipal councils, and allow local members of the Chinese 
National People's Congress to stand for election here. 
  There was a 100 percent attendance by councillors for what 
was deemed to be the legislature's toughest session, given 
China's strident opposition to the Patten proposals and warnings 
that anything that was decided would be scrapped in 1997 anyway. 
  Chief Secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang said she was pleased 
with the result. Mrs Chan said she hoped China would accept the 
system which has been decided by a legislature capable of making 
a judgment for the vast majority of Hong Kong people. "I hope 
China will appreciate we have the wider interests of Hong Kong 
at heart and we will do our very best to seek cooperation with 
China," she said. 
  The first attempt to block the bill was launched by veteran 
legislator and Patten adversary, Elsie Tu, but she was defeated 
36 to 23 after three hours of debate. Mrs Tu was supported by 
the 15 Liberal Party members and seven pro-China legislators and 
independents. 
  Later in the evening, the Liberal Party tried again to stall 
the more controversial part of the election law -- the 
single-seat, single-vote system for the 1995 election of the 
legislature -- but was defeated after another three hours of 
debate. The amendment tabled by party chief Allen Lee Peng-fei 
was rejected 35-15. 
  Independent legislator Eric Li Ka-cheung, who sought to 
restore the appointment seats to the district boards and the 
municipal councils, was opposed by 41 members. Only eight 
legislators voted for Mr Li's motion, most of his supporters 
being independents. 
  Mrs Tu warned Hong Kong people would be victimised if China 
and Britain failed to co-operate. She said: "Let me make clear 
at the outset that I believe in democracy if that means finding 
ways to improve the livelihood of the people. But I do not 
believe in a political power struggle that leads the community 
into a state of fear and anxiety about the future." 
Disappointed with the fact that there would be no further talks 
because the reforms had gone through, Mrs Tu said: "If I were 
asked to be an adviser (to China), I would feel this time I must 
do it." 
  But independent legislator Christine Loh Kung-wai said the 
proposals carried in the bill were very moderate. If such 
proposals were to be rejected, it meant that Hong Kong would 
only capitulate to China's wishes, she said. 
  Standing Orders required 12 rounds of voting on the 
amendments before a final decision could be reached. The 
original proposals got through with only the slight adjustment 
to the title suggested by independent legislator Andrew Wong 
Wang-fat. 
  The voting, which will fuel the Chinese anger, came only 10 
hours before Mr Patten is to start another dispute by publishing 
the British version of what went on during the 17 rounds of 
talks about political reforms. The Governor will explain to 
Legco at the question time session beginning at 1430 why he had 
decided to go ahead with publishing a White Paper. 
  A total of 100,000 copies of the White Paper, 70,000 in 
Chinese and 30,000 in English, will be released at 1700 and will 
be available to the public tomorrow morning. 
  Secretary for Constitutional Affairs Nicholas Ng Wing-fui 
said at the end of the debate on Mrs Tu's motion that the 
Government was now left with no alternative but to proceed with 
the bill. "We have now come to the point where we simply have 
no other alternative but to get on with the legislative 
process," he said. "The Chinese side has made it known on 
numerous occasions that there would be no more talks unless we 
first withdrew the current bill. Surely, this is a demand which 
neither the community nor this council will find acceptable." 
  Mr Ng said the bill was needed for the orderly preparation 
of 
elections in 1994/95.

  [Text] Beijing, February 24 (XINHUA) -- A spokesman of the 
Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council 
(HKMAOSC) of China made a statement to XINHUA here today after 
the Legislative Council (Legco) of Hong Kong passed this morning 
the partial electoral bill submitted by Chris Patten, governor 
of Hong Kong. 
  Following is the full text of the statement: 
  After the 17th round of the Sino-British talks on the 
arrangements for the 1994/95 election in Hong Kong was held, the 
British side walked away first from the negotiating table and 
submitted the electoral bill to the Legco despite the earlier 
statement made by the Chinese side, thus, terminating the talks. 
  Even so, we made it clear repeatedly that for the Chinese 
side the door for negotiations was open under the prerequisite 
that the British side must withdraw the submitted partial bill 
from the Legco. However, the British side has ignored this and 
clung obstinately on its own course. It has not only had the 
partial bill passed at the Legco, but also decided unilaterally 
to make public the contents of the 17 rounds of the Sino-British 
talks and to submit the rest of the electoral bill to the Legco, 
thus closing completely the door for resuming the talks. 
Therefore, the British side should be held fully responsible 
for ruining the talks. 
  The Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law 
stipulate that the British administration of Hong Kong will 
terminate on June 30, 1997 and the Chinese Government will 
resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong as of July 1, 
1997. In accordance with these provisions, the Chinese side 
reiterates that as component parts of the British political body 
administrating Hong Kong, the last British-Hong Kong district 
boards, the two municipal polls and the Legislative Council will 
definitely be terminated together with the end of the British 
administration of Hong Kong. Before the Chinese and British 
sides reach an agreement on the arrangements for the 1994/95 
elections, the three-level bodies produced on the basis of the 
partial electoral bill passed by the British-Hong Kong Legco or 
any other electoral bill possibly to be passed by the Legco 
cannot stand over the year of 1997. By that time, the political 
body of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will be 
formed according to the decisions of the Chinese National 
People's Congress and the relevant provisions of the Basic Law.

  [Text] Beijing, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Chinese 
Vice-President Rong Yiren said that the current difficulties on 
the Hong Kong issue have been created by the non-cooperative 
approach of the British side. 
  Rong made the remarks when meeting here today with Sir 
Adrian 
Swire, chairman of the British firm of John Swire and Sons Ltd, 
and his party. 
  He said that Hong Kong is a very important region of 
finance, 
trade and transportation and China is very interested in the 
development of Hong Kong. 
  Touching on the construction of Hong Kong's new airport, 
Rong 
noted that there is a memorandum of understanding on the issue 
between China and Britain whose principles should be followed by 
the two countries. The British side should adopt a sincere and 
fair attitude. 
  He pointed out that the current troubles on the Hong Kong 
issue have been created by the non-cooperative approach of the 
British side. The responsibility does not lie with the Chinese 
side. 
  The vice-president stressed that China is full of confidence 
in the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. 
  Rong also briefed the guest on the current situation of 
China's reform and opening up drive, adding that the purpose of 
the Chinese Government is to give the economy a sustained, fast 
and healthy development through reforms. 
  The reform process of the first two months of this year had 
been smooth, Rong said. 
  Sir Adrian Swire said that his company has been confident in 
Hong Kong and Chinese Mainland and it has been enlarging its 
business in the region, adding that it would continue to do so 
in the future. 
  He noted that his current China tour is aimed at learning 
more about China's reform process and getting acquainted with 
China's idea on Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability. 
  He also expressed the willingness and confidence of his 
company to conduct long-term investment in Hong Kong and China. 
  Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing also met with Sir Adrian 
Swire and his party today.

<F P=106> [By M.Y. Sung in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] Britain yesterday accused China of leaking the 
contents of the Sino-British talks on electoral arrangements. 
The British said the Chinese leak had led to the decision to 
reveal the contents of the 17 rounds of talks. British 
Ambassador to China, Sir Robin McLaren said Britain was aware 
that much of the talks' contents had been leaked by the Chinese 
side. 
  Governor Chris Patten is to release a White Paper today, 
setting out the British side's account of the failed 
negotiations. "This is, of course, against the background of a 
great deal of leaking of the contents of talks from the other 
side," Sir Robin said. "It was necessary to make the contents 
of the talks available before the second stage of Mr Patten's 
reform bill was tabled," he said. 
  He refused to confirm whether a copy of the White Paper had 
been sent to China, but he said he was in regular touch with the 
Chinese side. He did not agree that the disclosure would lead 
to a total termination of Sino-British cooperation. "For our 
part, we are very concerned cooperation should be maintained to 
the maximum extent possible. Concerning the new airport, all 
details and technical matters being discussed in the JLG (Joint 
Liaison Group) need cooperation." 
  Meanwhile, members of a Chinese think-tank expected that 
China would reveal its own version of the contents of the talks. 
Member of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) Tsang 
Yok-sing said the Chinese side would have no obligation to keep 
the promise of confidentiality if the British side unilaterally 
revealed the contents of the talks. He believed the Chinese 
side would also soon reveal their view of the talks as it now 
made no sense to withhold the facts. 
  Former senior Executive Councillor, Sir Sze-yuen Chung 
opposed unilateral disclosure. He said there should be joint 
disclosure, as it was likely the two sides would give two 
different versions. "I do not agree that Britain and China 
should each separately reveal their own version," Sir Sze-yuen 
said. A new battle between the two sides could arise if there 
were two different versions. The people of Hong Kong would be 
puzzled about which version was true, he said. 
  Former Basic Law drafter Simon Li said a unilateral 
disclosure could be misleading. It could polarise the views of 
the Hong Kong public. "Some people will take the British side's 
version if they have more confidence in the British, while other 
people will take the Chinese side," Mr Li said. "But this is 
the way politics is."

<F P=106> [Report by Chip Tsao in Hong Kong and Rain Ren in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] A senior Chinese official in Hong Kong has told 
EASTERN EXPRESS the real sticking point in the protracted 
Sino-British talks was the issue of appointed seats on the 
district boards after 1997. The official spoke as the Governor, 
Chris Patten, was preparing to disclose the contents of the 
secret Sino-British talks on political reform in Hong Kong later 
today. 
  In Beijing, an official said the Chinese Government would be 
publishing its own account of how the talks failed after 
assessing the Hong Kong government's White Paper. The Beijing 
official said: "We would like to see what Mr Patten wants to say 
about the breakdown of the talks before we release our side of 
the story." 
  It is understood the Chinese account will focus on its 
concessions during the negotiations. 
  The Chinese official in Hong Kong said that technically 
there 
was "no 17th [final] round of talks" because Peter Lai, the 
deputy secretary of constitutional affairs, rejected China's 
compromise proposal during a preliminary discussion with the 
Chinese team leader, Jiang Enzhu. The Chinese compromise 
proposal was to give Hong Kong fully elected district boards 
before 1997. After the transfer of sovereignty the new 
government would add 100 appointed district board members to the 
338 directly elected members. 
  He said that, as the talks drew to a close, there was 
tentative agreement on three of the five key issues. They were: 
The lowering of the voting age to 18; the affirmation that 
district boards were to be given no executive powers; and the 
right of members of the National People's Congress to take part 
in Legislative Council elections. 
  The issues where there was no sign of an agreement were: The 
abolition of appointed seats on the district boards; and whether 
the single vote, single seat method should be applied to all 
three echelons of election. 
  A Hong Kong government official said the British side could 
not accept China's compromise proposals because the number of 
seats for the district boards was a matter to be decided by the 
future Special Adminstrative Region (SAR) government. He 
believed the Chinese compromise proposal amounted to "an 
undermining of the SAR's autonomy". 
  On his arrival in Beijing for the Preliminary Working 
Committee meeting, a PWC member, Tsang Yok-shing, said he hoped 
the Chinese side would release its document on the talks as soon 
as possible.

  [Text] Zhou Nan, director of the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, 
yesterday clarified the rumor that he was to be transferred to 
Beijing. According to Zhou Nan, a rumor of this kind appears 
about once a year and may reappear in the future. He said the 
principle for coping with it was very simple -- "just ignore it." 
  In addition, Deputy Director Zhang Junsheng said that the 
news was untrue and inaccurate.

<F P=106> [By reporter Wen Jie (5113 1240): "Zhou Nan Calls For </F>
Common Efforts To Ensure China's Resumption of Sovereignty Over 
Hong Kong in 1997 and the Implementation of the `One Country, 
Two Systems' Policy"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 18 Feb (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--This 
afternoon, the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY hosted 
a Spring Festival cocktail party in the Maxim Palace Restaurant 
in Causeway Bay's World Trade Center. Several Hong Kong 
celebrities were invited and the atmosphere was warm. 
  In his speech, Director Zhou Nan said: Over the past year, 
under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the instructions of 
the 14th CPC National Congress, China has made world-renowned 
achievements in its reform, opening up, and modernization. Its 
GNP has grown by 13 percent, ranking it first in the world. In 
the past year, China has witnessed sensible policies, harmonious 
human relations, political tranquility, and stability in popular 
sentiment; the country's comprehensive strength has increased, 
and its international position has improved. In the New Year, 
we will continue to seize the opportunity, deepen reform, widen 
opening up, promote development, maintain stability, make an 
important step forward in establishing the socialist market 
economic structure, implement a number of major reform measures, 
and bring about sustained, rapid, and healthy [as received] 
national economic development. We will usher in the 45th 
founding anniversary of the PRC with more brilliant achievements 
in our modernization drive. 
  Over the past year, Hong Kong's economy has further merged 
with the motherland's economy. The mainland's vigorous 
development has enabled Hong Kong to overcome all kinds of 
negative factors and to maintain a comparatively high economic 
growth rate, which stands at appropriately 5.5 percent. This 
fully suggests that the motherland's stability and development 
serve as the most solid foundation for Hong Kong's prosperity 
and stability. We are completely convinced that, in the New 
Year, exchanges and cooperation in the economic, trade, and 
other fields between Hong Kong and the mainland will further 
develop and move a step higher. 
  Over the past year, we have sincerely hoped that China and 
Britain would reach agreement on Hong Kong's 1994-1995 electoral 
arrangements on the basis of "three conformities," and we have 
done our utmost toward this end. The British side, however, has 
obstinately persisted in the erroneous stance of the "three 
violations" and brazenly submitted parts of its constitutional 
reform package to the Legislative Council at a time when no 
agreement had been reached between the two sides. As a result, 
the Sino-British talks have ruptured, and the good wishes of the 
Chinese side and the Hong Kong compatriots have completely 
fallen through. Now people can understand more explicitly that 
the British side is completely responsible for the breakdown of 
the talks. However, Hong Kong's destiny is, after all, 
controlled by the great Chinese people, including the Hong Kong 
compatriots. In no way can the British side's uncooperative 
attitude stop the wheel of history from moving forward. In the 
future, alongside the Hong Kong compatriots, we will actively 
make all kinds of preparations for the establishment of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region firmly in accordance with the 
"one country, two systems" policy and the provisions of the 
Basic Law. We enjoy the backing of the powerful motherland and 
the effective support of the Chinese people. We possess all the 
necessary conditions to overcome all sorts of obstacles to our 
progress, to bring about a steady transition in 1997, and to 
ensure Hong Kong's long-term stability and prosperity. 
  There is only a little more than three years until the 
historic moment of Hong Kong's return to the motherland. Let us 
unite as one, work with one heart and one mind, remove all 
obstacles, ensure China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong 
Kong in 1997 and the comprehensive implementation of the "one 
country, two systems" policy, and work hard for the fulfillment 
of this great and glorious mission entrusted to us by history. 
The future of our great motherland and Hong Kong is infinitely 
bright.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Zhang Junsheng Comments on Chris </F>
Patten's Trip to Australia, Saying That It Is of No Use for Him 
To Play the `International Card'"] 
  [Text] Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the XINHUA Hong 
Kong Branch, said on 17 February that the Hong Kong issue is a 
matter between China and Britain and that no other country has 
the right to comment on the Hong Kong issue and still less the 
right to intervene in Hong Kong's affairs. 
  Asked whether the Hong Kong governor's trip to Australia was 
intended to play the "international card," Zhang Junsheng, who 
was attending a Spring Festival party hosted by the General 
Chinese Chamber of Commerce yesterday, said: It is not just now 
that the Hong Kong governor is beginning to do this. He did it 
as early as 1992. But it is of no use to play the international 
card. As for the fact that some officials of other countries 
chime in and agree with the governor's words, Zhang Junsheng 
stressed: They do not have much of an understanding of Hong 
Kong's affairs. Moreover, Hong Kong's affairs should only be 
studied and discussed between the Chinese and British 
Governments. A third country has no right whatsoever to 
intervene in Hong Kong's affairs nor any right to say this or 
that about the Hong Kong issue. 
  Regarding the Hong Kong governor's affirmation that his 
"political reform proposal" does not violate the "three 
principles," Zhang Junsheng said: If the Hong Kong governor 
were honest, he should have a very good understanding whether or 
not his so-called political reform proposal violates the Joint 
Declaration, the Basic Law, and the understandings and 
agreements reached between China and Britain because it has been 
more than one and a half years now since October 1992. 
Moreover, with so many views expressed by all sectors of Hong 
Kong and the many views advanced by the Chinese side which have 
been published in many newspapers and which have even been 
compiled into booklets, how then can he take them as if he did 
not see them. 
  He added: Even now, he still insists that his proposal does 
not violate the Joint Declaration, the Basic Law, and the 
understandings and agreements reached between China and Britain. 
In fact, it is very difficult to understand why, as a governor 
of Hong Kong, he can say this irrespective of any facts. 
  Regarding the second reading of the first portion of the 
political reform proposal in the Legislative Council [Legco] 
next Wednesday, Zhang Junsheng reiterated: The Chinese side had 
favored that China and Britain could make good arrangements for 
some affairs during the transition period with good cooperation, 
particularly some questions including the electoral system. But 
the fact that the British side does not cooperate has led to the 
breakdown of the Sino-British talks over the arrangements for 
the 1994-1995 elections. Therefore, given no cooperation and no 
agreement between China and Britain, it is very clear that the 
three-tier councils will all cease to be and will be reorganized 
on 30 June 1997. 
  He pointed out: Under these circumstances, whatever things 
or bills the Legco may pass and whatever a Legco is to be 
established, which will only last for 20 months, are the own 
affairs of the British Hong Kong Government, while the Chinese 
side will attend to things properly, together with Hong Kong 
residents, for Hong Kong's transition in keeping with the Basic 
Law and the Joint Declaration and will set up a government and a 
legislature for the special administrative region. 
  As for the fact that the British side stated the need to 
publicize the contents of the talks, Zhang Junsheng said: The 
Chinese side will not be opposed to this at all as long as the 
British side does this through the diplomatic channel. However, 
I hope the British side should not "curtail the context" as it 
did when it publicized the seven letters exchanged between the 
Chinese and British foreign ministers.

<F P=106> [Report: "Zhang Junsheng Stresses That If British Side </F>
Publishes Contents of Talks, Chinese Side Will Make 
Corresponding Response"] 
  [Text] If the British side unilaterally releases details 
of the Sino-British talks, the Chinese side will definitely 
respond accordingly, Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the 
XINHUA News Agency Hong Kong Branch, said today. Releasing the 
records of the Sino-British talks will do no credit to Chris 
Patten, he noted. 
  Present at the 1994 International Calligraphy Exhibition 
yesterday, Zhang Junsheng said: We never objected to any 
arrangement to release the records of the 17 rounds of talks 
between China and Britain on the arrangements for the 1994-95 
elections in Hong Kong. But, at the beginning of the talks, the 
Chinese and British sides agreed to keep the contents of the 
talks secret, and if the contents are to be released, this 
should only be done after prior consent is reached between the 
two sides through diplomatic channels. The British side first 
said that the contents of the talks would be released by the 
British Hong Kong Government. But now they say that they will 
be jointly released by the British Government and the British 
Hong Kong Government. This move that the British Hong Kong 
Government is going to make indicates that they has gone farther 
and farther on the road against cooperation. 
  Zhang Junsheng added that it was a natural outcome for the 
British side to take this step. Chris Patten provoked disputes 
as soon as the talks started. During the talks, the British 
side played many little tricks to interfere in and undermine the 
talks. Finally, the British side unilaterally terminated the 
talks, and tabled the so-called constitutional reform package in 
the Legislative Council [Legco]. Thus the talks terminated and 
broke down. 
  Zhang Junsheng said: We never hoped to see disputes break 
out. During the talks, we upheld the principle of the "three 
conformities" and we hoped to reach an agreement with the 
British side. However, the British side unilaterally terminated 
the talks and quit the negotiating table. In spite of this, we 
still wish to see the British side return to the negotiating 
table, of course, on condition that the part of the 
constitutional reform package that has already been tabled to 
Legco is withdrawn before talks are resumed according to the 
principle of the "three conformities." It is a pity that the 
British side has now gone farther and farther.

<F P=106> [Report by Jim Cheung] </F>
  [Text] Britain and China remained deadlocked over the size 
of the new Stonecutters Island naval base after the second day 
of talks yesterday. Experts from the Sino-British Joint Liaison 
Group (JLG), will resume negotiations tomorrow in a bid to break 
the eight-year impasse over the disposal of military land in the 
territory before 1997. 
  Emerging from the second of four scheduled days of talks, 
Chinese team leader Luo Jiahuan said the Chinese side remained 
dissatisfied over the size of the military base for the People's 
Liberation Army on Stonecutters Island after the changeover. 
"We insist on a naval base as big as the present HMS Tamar 
headquarters," Mr Luo said. 
  But he rejected claims that a sizeable naval base in the 
future Special Administrative Region (SAR) was needed because it 
would be used as a strategic defence base for southern China 
after 1997. 
  The Chinese side also raised new proposals on the future 
disposal of military land during the four hours of talks 
yesterday. "But the British side failed to give a response on 
the spot," Mr Luo said. 
  British team leader Alan Paul said he would carefully 
consider the proposals raised by the Chinese. Mr Paul 
maintained the two sides would try to reach agreement in the 
remaining two days of discussion. He also revealed that the two 
sides had already discussed the construction costs of the future 
naval base and the disposal of married quarters for the British 
garrison in Central. The Chinese have stipulated that the 
married quarters should be kept for PLA officers.

<F P=106> [Special dispatch: "Beijing Orders Reduction in </F>
Outside-the-Border Activities To Invite Investment"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 16 February (LIEN HO PAO) -- This year, 
the number of large-scale investment promotion exhibitions held 
outside of China by various localities will be significantly 
reduced. 
  The relevant department in the State Council has issued an 
order that all the plans of provinces, autonomous regions, and 
municipalities for holding investment attraction activities in 
Hong Kong and other places abroad must be submitted to the 
relevant authorities in the State Council for examination and 
approval. Such examination will be even stricter with 
applications filed by counties, cities (at the county level), 
and individual enterprises. Besides reporting to the government 
immediately above them for examination, they must also seek 
approval from the relevant authorities in the State Council. 
This injunction emphasizes that all kinds of investment 
attraction activities must put practical results first. 
  In the meantime, the relevant authorities in the State 
Council also stated that all forms of investment attraction 
activities and all kinds of festivals that let "economic and 
trade activities steal the show on the stage of cultural events" 
conducted by various localities must be brought under overall 
planning. 
  This measure is taken because the excessive amount of 
investment attraction activities in the past have caused many 
negative consequences. 
  One is that there are too many "sham foreign investors." 
Many investments supposedly made by foreign investors and 
foreign-funded enterprises are actually the funds of mainland 
organizations that have returned after being taken outside the 
border to get a different signature. The purpose is to avoid 
profit delivery and to enjoy the preferential policies 
applicable to foreign investments in such areas as taxation and 
goods import and export. The other result is that the 
percentage of foreign investments that were actually fed into 
the projects when required is extremely low. The flooding 
investment attraction activities have led to an unhealthy 
tendency of boasting, exaggeration, and lying. As a result, 
letters of intent and agreements involving huge investments that 
cannot be materialized are all over the place. The third 
consequence is the appalling waste of money in organizing such 
activities. 
  At some investment attraction events outside the country (or 
border), the size of the delegations is getting bigger and 
bigger and they are going in for escalating ostentation and 
extravagance. Some of them enjoy sightseeing abroad at public 
expense under the pretext of inviting investments and even go so 
far as to resort to fraud and deception. 
  In view of this, in order to put an end to the corrupt 
tendencies in economic activities, the State Council, in good 
time, issued to all localities in the country a "red-letterhead 
document" containing stern measures, putting a firm check on 
investment attraction activities held in Hong Kong and other 
places abroad. Whoever disobeys the order will be prosecuted.

  [Text] Beijing, February 24 (XINHUA) -- The responsibility 
for the disruption of cooperation between China and Britain on 
Hong Kong's political system rests entirely on the British side, 
said a Foreign Ministry spokesman at a weekly news conference 
here this afternoon. 
  The Hong Kong Legislative Council [Legco] today passed the 
first-phase draft legislation on the 1994-95 election 
arrangements. The Hong Kong Government will also submit the 
second-phase draft legislation to the Legco for discussion. 
  The Foreign Ministry spokesman said that last December, 
before the Chinese and the British sides had reached any 
agreement on the district board election arrangements, the 
British side submitted the first-phase draft of legislation to 
the Hong Kong Legislative Council, thus directly causing the 
termination of the talks between China and Britain. 
  Now, in disregard of repeated dissuasion by China, and the 
aspirations of all the social strata in Hong Kong for a 
settlement of the question concerning the 1994-1995 election 
arrangements through negotiations, the British side has had the 
first-phase draft legislation on the 1994-95 election 
arrangements passed by the Hong Kong Legco and also decided to 
submit the second-phase draft legislation to the Legco for 
discussion. 
  The spokesman said: "This fully shows that the British side 
does not have sincerity to solve the question through 
cooperation with the Chinese side, and is bent on moving further 
on this erroneous path. 
  "The door of negotiation has been closed by the British 
side," he said. 
  "The responsibility for the disruption of cooperation 
between 
China and Britain on Hong Kong's political system rests entirely 
with the British side," he said. 
  He noted that the Chinese side reiterates that without an 
agreement between China and Britain, the framework of the 
three-tiered political system established through British Hong 
Kong authorities legislation cannot last beyond June 30, 1997. 
  The British side today published a white paper to disclose 
the detailed contents of last year's Sino-British talks. 
  An understanding not to disclose to the public the contents 
of the negotiations was reached between China and Britain before 
the talks began last year, he said. 
  Today's act by Britain "is against the understanding," he 
said. "The Chinese side cannot but make due reactions," he added. 
  Asked about Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans, in a 
recent TV interview in Australia, expressing strong support for 
the political package of Chris Patten, the spokesman said that 
what was now at issue between China and Britain on Hong Kong "is 
not whether Hong Kong should have democracy, but whether 
commitment is to be honored." 
  He said that there were a series of agreements and 
understandings between the two countries on the evolution of 
Hong Kong's political system. "But the British side is now 
trying to repudiate them and have its own way. This is 
absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese side," he said. 
  "In the more than one hundred years during the British rule, 
there has been no democracy at all in Hong Kong," he said. "It 
is with ulterior motives that Britain pushes a Chris Patten 
package in Hong Kong before it leaves. It will be futile to 
defend the package. 
  "The maintenance of Hong Kong's social stability and 
economic 
prosperity is not only in the interests of China and Britain, 
but also of those countries that have economic interests in Hong 
Kong," he said. 
  "The question of Hong Kong is a matter between China and 
Britain before June 30, 1997, and from July 1, 1997, it will be 
purely an internal affair of China," he said. "It is 
inappropriate to make irresponsible remarks on the political 
affairs of Hong Kong."

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Yijun (1728 4135 0193)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 23 Feb (XINHUA) -- While meeting with 
former U.S. Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger this morning 
at Zhongnanhai, Chinese President Jiang Zemin said that 
development and peace remain the two issues confronting the 
world. 
  Jiang Zemin said: The current international situation is 
still changing in a complicated and profound way. The world is 
developing in the direction of multipolarization, and 
regionalization and conglomeration of the world economy are 
tending to accelerate. However, the various contradictions and 
conflicts concealed by the Cold War are gradually being 
uncovered, leading to disturbances, clashes, and even the 
spilling of blood in some areas. 
  On Sino-U.S. relations, Jiang Zemin said: China has always 
attached much importance to developing relations with the United 
States. More mutual trust and cooperation between China and the 
United States will help the two countries to play a more active 
role in handling international affairs. 
  He said: Sino-U.S. relations have seen some positive 
developments since the meeting between the presidents of the two 
countries last year. Exchanges of high-level visits have 
increased, and bilateral trade and economic cooperation have 
been strengthened. All these are helpful in promoting mutual 
understanding and solving differences. 
  Jiang Zemin believed: As long as both sides have their eyes 
on the over-all situation and the next century, grasp [ba wo 
2116 2250] the long-term interests of the two countries, 
strictly observe the principles of the three joint communiques 
between the two governments, respect the facts, increase 
consultations, and seek common ground while reserving 
differences, Sino-U.S. relations will be able to maintain 
constant development on a normal track. 
  During the meeting, Eagleburger said the changes that have 
taken place in China are very impressive, and all those who are 
concerned about stability in the next century must be aware of 
the importance of correctly handling U.S.-Chinese relations, 
because a sound Sino-U.S. relationship is beneficial not only to 
the two countries, but to world stability, and peace as well. 
  Eagleburger is here as a guest of the Chinese Foreign 
Ministry, leading a U.S. "China investment and trade" 
delegation. The delegation arrived in Beijing on 21 February 
for a goodwill visit to China.

  [Text] Vienna, February 23 (XINHUA) -- The International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today urged the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea (DPRK) to issue visas allowing inspectors to 
check its nuclear facilities. 
  On the last day of a three-day regular session of the 
Vienna-based UN organization, Ronald Walker, the chairman of the 
IAEA's board of governors, said that the IAEA also welcomes 
DPRK's February 15 agreement to let IAEA inspect seven of its 
nine nuclear facilities. 
  Meanwhile, a DPRK spokesman told the press here that DPRK's 
agreement on nuclear inspections has pre-conditions, and that 
his country definitely rejects inspection of the other two 
nuclear facilities located in Yongbyon. 
  The DPRK has delayed the issuing of visas to IAEA inspectors 
because of what it called position shifting by the United States. 
  The DPRK and the United States have been holding talks on 
DPRK's nuclear issues in New York.

<F P=106> [By reporter Li Xiuqing (2621 4423 3237)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 22 Feb (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng and Liu 
Huaqing, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission [CMC], 
sent letters to the first working conference of the China 
Aerospace Industry Corporation [CAIC], which opened on 21 
February, expressing the hope that the aerospace front will 
seize the opportunity, make persistent efforts, and step up 
reform to bring about greater development in China's aerospace 
industry by the end of this century. 
  Li Peng stated in his letter: The aerospace industry 
occupies a very important position in China's economic 
construction and construction of national defense. It has been 
the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the CMC's 
consistent principle to maintain a momentum for developing 
China's aerospace industry and to step up the transfer of 
aerospace technology to the national economic construction. In 
the past 30 years or so, you have scored great achievements in 
and made contributions to the development of China's aerospace 
industry through unremitting efforts. I earnestly hope that, 
through this conference, you will further unify your thinking, 
change your concepts, seize the opportunity, deepen reform, and 
step up development on the basis of Comrade Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics to make new 
contributions to enhancing China's defense capability, promoting 
national economic development, and increasing China's overall 
national strength. 
  Liu Huaqing said in his letter: Now China has turned a new 
page in the aerospace industry to carry forward its development 
and forge ahead into the future. I hope you will keep your 
sacred missions firmly in mind, start from the world strategy 
and supreme interests of the state, greet challenges, keenly 
engage in reform, and bravely scale new heights in your industry 
to create a brighter future for the Chinese aerospace industry. 
  State Councillor Song Jian attended and addressed the 
conference. He also expressed his ardent expectations of further 
developing the aerospace industry. 
  The CAIC was established last year by reorganizing a former 
government organ, according to the decision of the CPC Central 
Committee and the State Council, to meet the need to establish a 
socialist market economic system. In his report to the 
conference, President Liu Jiyuan said: During over one year of 
intense work, the aerospace front has smoothly completed 
institutional transformation and has brought many new reform 
measures into practice. Organs at various levels were 
streamlined, their work style changed moderately, and their 
efficiency rose to some extent. The industry has made great 
achievements in the fields of scientific research, production, 
development of civilian products, export, and separate 
management of military goods and civilian products, and has thus 
laid a foundation for further development. 
  The new ideas for developing the aerospace industry are: 
"developing aerospace industry, stressing civilian products, 
improving economic returns, and marching toward the world." The 
industry's objectives of development by the year 2000 are: 
"making great developments in applied satellites and the 
application of satellites and industrializing them in earnest by 
successfully developing and manufacturing a new generation of 
telecommunications satellites, meteorological satellites, 
resource satellites, and new aerospace engineering; further 
modernizing weaponry; developing the CAIC into a high-tech and 
large-scale transnational conglomerate; marketing Chinese-made 
satellites and their parts and other civilian goods on the 
international market, after consolidating and strengthening the 
existing position of China's carrier rockets on the 
international market, to better serve people of the world; and, 
from now on, setting the average annual growth rate of this 
industry's total output value at 20 percent and its annual per 
capita productivity over 100,000 yuan, so that the aerospace 
industry will truly become one of the attractive industries.

  [Text] On 29 January, the municipal intermediate people's 
court tested and verified, according to laws, five criminals who 
premeditatedly killed persons and two criminals who 
premeditatedly hurt others. These criminals were escorted to 
the execution ground and were shot. 
  These seven criminal offenders were as follows: Zhou 
Tonglun, a temporary worker at Dazhong electrical appliance 
plant of Fengtai District, attempted to kill, but seriously 
maimed, a young woman. Xie Gongran, a peasant at Zhuangnian 
Village of Baoshanshi Township of Huairou County, raped and 
killed a woman. Zhang Jinchao, a worker at Xinhua printing 
house, killed his sister-in-law due to household dispute. Ge 
Yanyu, an unemployed person in the municipality, killed a young 
woman. Zhang Jianguo, a worker at the No. 5 pharmaceutical 
plant of Beijing, killed two persons and hurt two persons. Wang 
Chengke, a worker of No. 1 installation team of the boiler and 
freezing company under the equipment installation company of 
Beijing Municipality, created disturbances and killed a person 
after getting drunk. Ma Yongge, an employee of Shuanghe farm of 
Gannan County of Heilongjiang Province, beat to death a citizen 
who tried to stop Ma from engaging in illegal activities. 
  While working as a temporary worker at the electrical 
appliance plant, Zhou Tonglun, 22, attempted to pay court to a 
young woman, 22, called Wei who was also working at the plant 
and was rejected. So, Criminal Zhou premeditatedly killed Wei 
and her boyfriend called Feng. On 10 February 1993 at Dazhong 
electrical appliance plant of Fengtai District, Criminal Zhou 
caught Wei off guard and used a kitchen knife to stab Wei in the 
head 10 times. He later chased Feng, but failed to catch up 
with him. After being given emergency treatment, the young 
woman was fortunately free from danger, but became seriously 
maimed. 
  Xie Gongran, 33, committed adultery with his sister-in-law 
called Zheng for a long period of time. Xie was not happy when 
Zheng became estranged. On 13 June in 1993, Xie rushed into 
Zheng's house, damaged Zheng's television set and video 
recorder, and beat Zheng to death with an iron tube. 
  The municipal intermediate court maintained: The above seven 
criminals killed and hurt persons with tools and seriously 
damaged the social order of the capital. The evil criminal 
nature and the serious consequences of the cases have brought 
extreme damage to the society and have made the people feel 
aggrieved.

<F P=106> [By Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Liu </F>
Zhenmin (0491 2182 2404) and XINHUA reporter Zhu Youdi (2612 
1635 2769)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 24 Feb (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng 
recently invited scientists, educators, and writers and artists 
to three forums in Zhongnanhai to solicit their views on 
revising the government work report (for the solicitation of 
opinions) to be delivered to the Second Session of the Eighth 
National People's Congress for deliberation. 
  Many of the scientists, educators, and writers were invited 
to air views on the revision of the government work report in 
Zhongnanhai for the first time. The forums were permeated with 
a cheerful and animated atmosphere. Among those who spoke were 
He Zuoxiu, member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [CAS]; Yu 
Changyou, director of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry 
[MMI] Automation Research Institute; Cai Rang, deputy director 
of the MMI Iron and Steel Academy; Wang Sihong, head of the 
Beijing High and New Technology Development Experimental Zone; 
Duan Yongji, president of the Stone Group Company; Lu Liangshu, 
chairman of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences 
Academic Committee; Sun Shu, vice chairman of the CAS Division 
of Earth Science; Chen Zhangliang, director of Beijing 
University Life Science Institute; Beijing University president 
Wu Shuqing; Fang Huijian, party secretary of Qinghua University; 
Huang Tiecheng, vice president of Beijing Agriculture 
University; Nankai University president Mu Guoguang; Xie Xingui, 
president of the Central Radio and TV University; Tian Yutan, 
principal of the Beijing No. 1 Experimental Primary School; Shen 
Decai, principal of the Tianjin No. 1 Middle School; Ou 
Xueguang, principal of the Beijing Changping Agricultural 
Vocational School; Qin Shaode, party secretary of the Shanghai 
Municipal Education and Health Commission; performing artists 
Ying Ruocheng, Liu Changyu, Bai Shuxiang, and Yu Lan; writer 
Malaxinfu; writer Pan Xia and cultural relic expert Wang 
Shixiang of the China TV Drama Production Center; director Yang 
Weiguang of the Central Television Station; Lin Erwei, general 
manager and concurrently editor-in-chief of the Commercial 
Press; and director Ren Jiyu of the Beijing Library. 
  They agreed: The government work report (for the 
solicitation of opinions) has given a factual summation of 
China's remarkable achievements in science and technology, 
education, and culture in 1993, which once again bear testimony 
to the correct principles behind various structural reforms in 
the country. After reading the report, they have increased 
their confidence in this year's work. 
  Discussing the section dealing with science and technology, 
scientists suggested that the policy of "holding fast to one end 
and leaving the whole field open" should include some areas of 
applied sciences that cannot be immediately put to production 
use. They also suggested that leading scientific research 
institutes and academies should play a significant role in 
national economic construction by gearing their work to meeting 
the needs of the main front of economic development; that more 
effective measures be taken to promote the development of high 
and new technology; and that the State Council promptly 
formulate detailed rules for the implementation of the law 
governing scientific and technological progress. They also made 
suggestions on increasing government appropriations for science 
and technology, on combining science and technology with 
economic construction, on cultivating new industries, on 
building large modern enterprises, on adopting policies 
regarding high and new technology development zones, on 
developing agricultural science and technology, and on training 
young scientist and researchers. 
  While fully affirming the continuous advance of educational 
undertakings in the course of reform in 1993, educators said 
they were greatly inspired by the report's emphasis on "giving 
strategic priority to the development of education." Meanwhile, 
in view of the lack of urgency shown in developing education in 
some localities and departments, some educators proposed that 
the government attach importance to improving radio and 
television education, vocational education, normal education, 
and compulsory education; and should strengthen the intensity of 
educational reform; they added that efforts must be made to 
ensure that cultural education helps the healthy development of 
youngsters. Other educators suggested increasing government 
appropriations for education and stabilizing the contingent of 
teachers. 
  In their speeches, celebrities from literary and artistic 
circles said: The government work report's discussion on the 
need to bring about a "flourishing of socialist culture" means 
encouraging all writers and artists. They shall always adhere 
to the principles of serving the people and socialism, and of 
letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought 
contend. 
  Some comrades suggested reform of the system under which 
literature and art are produced was needed; that the state 
should support and finance the creation of literary and artistic 
masterpieces; and that, to make progress, the reading public and 
audiences needed more excellent works containing positive 
messages, though in keeping with the spirit of the times, if the 
nation wanted to encourage elegant art and develop its cultural 
tradition. 
  A number of comrades suggested greater cultural opening up 
through the improvement of exchanges with foreign countries and 
by intensifying research in basic culture. 
  Li Peng frankly exchanged views with everyone present. He 
said: Science and technology play an important role in enhancing 
comprehensive national power. We must depend on joint efforts 
by the government, enterprises, and all trades and professions 
in society to increase input in science and technology. 
Scientific research institutions must further strengthen their 
own vitality through deepening reform and integrate science and 
technology thoroughly with economic construction through 
competition. The future of China's science and technology still 
relies on its youth. We must attach importance to young 
scientists and make the most of the strong points of China's 
scientific and technological personnel. 
  Li Peng affirmed the practice of showing a hundred films on 
patriotism in middle and primary schools last year. He also 
said: Television education is mobile and flexible. It can be 
conducted among a vast number of students. We must increase 
television education in the future. 
  Li Peng said: We live in a great era. We face very good 
opportunities for development. It should be a splendid era in 
which culture and art will enjoy a high degree of development. 
The development of culture and art is closely bound up with 
this era. I hope writers and artists can produce works worthy 
of a great era. 
  Li Peng stressed the importance of the role of public 
opinion. He said: We must guide the masses of the people to 
encourage the spirit of patriotism and collectivism and to 
advocate our traditional virtues so as to inspire enthusiasm 
among the people for progress. Meanwhile, we must also expose 
abominable phenomena in society. While attaching importance to 
the social benefit of spiritual products, we must take into 
consideration their economic results. We must pay attention to 
providing guidance for various cultural phenomena in a bid to 
improve the cultural quality of our nation. 
  Li Peng thanked all present for having put forward very good 
opinions. He instructed the drafting group to properly sum up 
their speeches and to incorporate them in the government work 
report so as to pool the wisdom of the masses, better represent 
the will of the people, and do a further good job in conducting 
government work. 
  Among those who attended the forum at the invitation of Li 
Peng were Wang Dazhong, president of the Qinghua University; 
Wang Chengwei, permanent member of the Science and Technology 
Committee of the Commission of Science, Technology, and Industry 
for National Defense; Zhang Guangdou, professor of Qinghua 
University; Huang Da, president of the People's University of 
China; Xu Jialu, vice president of Beijing Normal University; 
Yang Guozhen, director of the Institute of Physics at the 
Chinese Academy of Sciences; Liang Shoupan, senior technical 
adviser of the China Aerospace Industry Corporation; Gu Songfen,

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of speech by Sun Weiben, secretary of the </F>
provincial party committee, at the report meeting on studying 
Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping on 18 
December; place not given: "A Scientific Guide to the 
Establishment of Socialism With Chinese Characteristics"] 
  [Text] Not long ago, I attended the theoretical study 
class held by the Central Party School for principal leading 
cadres at the provincial and ministerial levels. Then, I spent 
a month wholeheartedly studying Volume 3 of the Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping. Together with Volume 2 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping that was published 10 
years ago, this book is the foundation for the theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics--the Marxism of 
contemporary China; are the best teaching material and glorious 
banner to educate the people, to seek unity of thought, and to 
create a new situation in socialist cause; and are a scientific 
guide for us to march triumphantly. These books are rich, 
extensive, and profound in contents, are filled with a clear-cut 
spirit of our times and spirit of nationalities, and are 
illuminated with splendid light. In as short as a month, it is 
impossible for us to comprehensively and profoundly understand 
this book, the "true scripture" of the Marxist theoretical 
literature of our times. Hereafter, I will report to you on how 
Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping was 
compiled and relay the superficial understanding and experience 
gained from my first reading of this book. 
<H3>  Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping 
Inherits and Develops Marxism With New Ideas and Viewpoints </H3>
  Proceeding from the reality of China and by upholding the 
principle of combining Marxism with China's reality, Comrade 
Xiaoping has keenly throbbed with the pulse of our times, 
emancipated the mind, pioneered the road, blazed new trials, and 
led the party and the people create new and earth-shaking causes 
since the commencement of reform and opening up, thus changing 
the outlook of China and affecting the world. Just as pointed 
out by the report of the 14th CPC Congress: "We have inherited 
and developed Marxism with new ideas and viewpoints." The 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping is Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
overall understanding of the law of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, while Volume 3 of the Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping is a representative work of Marxist 
theory that enters a new state and attains new heights in 
contemporary China. To put it briefly, Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping has primarily set 
forth the following new ideas, new viewpoints, and new concepts: 
  1. The essence and fundamental task of socialism. Comrade 
Xiaoping said: "The essence of socialism is to liberate 
productive forces, develop productive forces, abolish 
exploitation, eliminate polarization, and finally achieve common 
prosperity." This points out that the fundamental task of 
socialism is to develop productive forces and the fundamental 
purpose is to eventually achieve common prosperity. This new 
viewpoint breaks away from the past fixed mode of thinking in 
which the essence of socialism was understood from the angle of 
production relations and superstructure, has set up a new mode 
of thinking in which the essence of socialism is understood from 
the standpoint of combining productive forces with production 
relations, thus completely placing the understanding of the 
essence of socialism on a scientific foundation of historical 
materialism. This new viewpoint has broken with the past 
limitations of regarding revolution as the liberation of 
productive forces only and has set up the new thinking mode of 
liberating and developing productive forces and constantly 
changing and perfecting socialism through reform, thus 
completely putting the understanding of the essence of socialism 
on a scientific foundation of dialectical materialism. This new 
viewpoint has set up the new thinking mode of "abolishing 
exploitation, eliminating polarization, and finally achieving 
common prosperity," thus making a clean break not only with the 
traditional socialism of "simultaneous prosperity" but also with 
capitalism characterized by exploitation and polarization. 
Then, this new viewpoint laid a completely new theoretical 
foundation stone for the establishment of socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, and this viewpoint can be considered a 
programmatic viewpoint commanding the whole book. 
  2. The criterion with regard to judging the "three 
advantages". Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "In the final 
analysis, not taking a full step in reform and opening up and 
not boldly pioneering a road means the fear of accumulation of 
more capitalist things and of taking a capitalist road. The 
crucial point in this regard is "being capitalist" or "being 
socialist." In following the criterion of judging these 
advantages, we should chiefly determine whether they are 
favorable for the development of productive forces; for 
enhancing the comprehensive strength of socialist countries; and 
for upgrading the people's living standard." This is a 
fundamental standard of judging all gains and losses in line 
with the socialist essence, which has been raised by Comrade 
Xiaoping after his several inferences of "practice being a sole 
criterion in testing the truth;" of freeing the entire party 
from the serious fetter of two whateverism; and of realizing the 
shifting of work emphasis. The criterion is also to free the 
entire party from the serious fetter of "being capitalist or 
socialist" and to orient reform and opening up into the new 
historic period of establishing the systems of socialist market 
economy. 
  3. The initial stage of socialism. Comrade Xiaoping pointed 
out: "The 13th congress of our party has clarified the initial 
stage in which China's socialism is and socialism practiced by 
China belongs to the initial stage. Socialism itself is in the 
initial stage of communism. However, China is still at the 
initial stage of practicing socialism. This means that China is 
staying in an undeveloped period. Therefore, we should 
formulate plans based on this theory and according to it." The 
theory of socialism's initial stage represents an important 
conclusion made by Comrade Xiaoping in understanding socialism 
over again. It has done away with the traditional socialist 
concept of "bigger in size, a more developed socialist nature, 
pure socialist essence." The theory has also placed the 
changes of the relations between ownership and distribution on 
the undeveloped level of productive forces. All of these have 
been the theoretical basis and fundamental starting points for 
the party to formulate its basic line and all principles or 
policies. 
  4. The economic development strategy with three steps. 
Comrade Xiaoping said: "We should take three steps in 
developing the economy. By the end of this century, we should 
accomplish the work of two steps by having people dress warmly 
and eat their fill as well as finally become better-off. We 
will spend 30 or 50 years in the next century on reaching the 
level of medium-developed countries. This is our strategic 
target as well as our lofty aspiration and great ideals." 
Realizing the target of modernizations step by step and in line 
with the periodical goals has not only reflected the spirit of 
respecting the economic law, seeking truth from facts, and 
stably making progress; but also drawn up a blueprint for 
Chinese nation to join in the strong nationalities in the world 
and to make socialism and itself prosperous. It also represents 
a grand program of uniting with the entire party and the people 
throughout the country to wage arduous struggles, to make 
unswerving efforts, and to head for the 21st century. 
  5. The seizure of opportunity, the acceleration of 
development, and efforts to improve the national economy to a 
new level every several years. While holding talks with several 
central comrades in 1991, Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "It is 
right for us to stress stability, however, it is possible for us 
to lose the opportunity if we overly stress it." "The large 
turn in the world at present just means opportunity." "All 
people are saying: What position we will be in the `century of 
Asia and Pacific'?" "If we fail to seize the opportunity and to 
improve the economy to a new level, other people will surpass us 
much faster and we will lag behind." 
  In his speeches given during his 1992 south China 
inspection tour, Comrade Xiaoping also said: "The key to seizing 
the opportunity to develop ourselves lies in developing the 
economy," "in their process of development, some countries also 
have had the period or stage of high-speed development," "in 
developing the economy, China should strive to reach a new 
height every few years," and "judging from our experiences in 
the past few years, it is possible for us to reach a new height 
in economic development every few years." The viewpoints 
Comrade Xiaoping has put forward not only seize the opportunity 
provided to China's economic development by the abrupt changes 
in the situation of the world, but they also conform to the 
objective law governing the periodic and wave upon wave of 
development and set forth an important historical responsibility 
for the entire party and people across the country to build a 
strong country amid the intense competition in the world. 
  6. Poverty is not socialism, nor is too sluggish a 
development. In his article "Learning From Historical 
Experiences and Preventing Erroneous Tendencies," Comrade 
Xiaoping said: "Many strange things emerged during the 10 years 
(meaning the 10 years of the Great Cultural Revolution). People 
were asked to be content with poverty and backwardness and to 
have impoverished socialism and communism rather than affluent 
capitalism. This was what the gang of four advocated. How can 
we have impoverished socialism and impoverished communism!" He 
emphasized repeatedly: "Socialism cannot hold its ground if it 
is always poverty-stricken," "socialism should eliminate 
poverty, and poverty is not socialism, still less communism," 
and "sluggish development is not socialism, either." The 
viewpoints Comrade Xiaoping repeatedly emphasized have clarified 
the long-standing serious chaos created by the "leftist" 
ideological trend and conformed to the basic requirements of the 
socialist system and the common desires of the millions of 
people. 
  7. Reform is China's second revolution. Comrade Xiaoping 
said: "Revolution is meant to liberate productive forces, and so 
is reform. It was a revolution to overthrow the reactionary 
rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism to 
liberate the productive forces of the Chinese people. 
Therefore, revolution is to liberate the productive forces. 
After the establishment of the socialist basic system, we 
should still fundamentally change the economic system that 
fetters the development of productive fores and establish a 
socialist economic system that is full of vigor and vitality to 
promote the development of productive forces. This is reform. 
Therefore, reform is also to liberate productive forces." 
Judging from China's practice, reform has effected and is 
effecting profound changes in the economic, political, social, 
scientific and technological, and cultural fields and major 
changes in people's standard of behavior, lifestyle, mind-set, 
concept on value, and criteria for right and wrong. Comrade 
Xiaoping's expositions indicate that the nature of the 
revolution is not an amendment to the minor details of the 
original economic system but a fundamental transformation of the 
economic system and a thorough change of the mechanism for 
economic operation. This has ideologically and theoretically 
mobilized our party to effectively promote reform. 
  8. China's development cannot be apart from the rest of the 
world. Self-blockade and self-isolation must be opposed. 
Comrade Xiaoping sets forth: "Now, the world is open. 
Following the industrial revolution of the Western countries, 
China became backward. One of the important reasons for this 
was that China closed itself to the international arena. After 
the founding of the PRC, they blockaded us and to a certain 
extent we closed ourselves to the international arena even more. 
All this has brought us some difficulties. Experience and the 
lessons of the past 30 years or so told us that construction 
could not be developed if the door is closed." "China's 
development cannot be apart from the world." Comrade Xiaoping's 
viewpoint deeply sums up China's experience and lessons in being 
reduced from a secondary powerful country to a backward one in 
the 100 years or so, conforms to the historical trend of 
internationalizing the world economy and making the world 
economy an organic whole, and sets forth a strategic issue of 
rejuvenating the Chinese nation. 
  9. Science and technology are the first productive forces. 
Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "Marx said that science and 
technology are productive forces. This is very accurate. Now, 
it seems that this saying is not enough. I think that science 
and technology are the first productive forces." This is the 
distillation of the theory on the current economic development 
and the practical experience in scientific and technological 
progress as well as the new development in Marxism. 
  10. Socialism and the market economy have no fundamental 
contradictions. Comrade Xiaoping said on several occasions: 
"The difference between capitalism and socialism does not hinge 
on planning or the market. Socialism has the market economy and 
capitalism has the control by planning." "There is no 
fundamental contradiction between socialism and the market 
economy." "The market economy can be developed under 
socialism." Comrade Xiaoping's inference has laid a theoretical 
foundation for setting up the socialist market economic system. 
If we say that encircling the cities from the rural areas is 
the only way to win the victory in China's first revolution, 
building the socialist market economic system is the only way to 
win the second victory in China's second revolution. 
  11. The reform of the political system must suit the reform 
of the economic system. Comrade Xiaoping said: "It will be 
difficult to reform the economic system if we do not reform the 
political system." "Along with the development of reform, we 
will inevitably come across obstacles." "What is more important 
is that the political system cannot suit the requirements for 
the reform of the economic system." "Whenever we make a step to 
promote the reform of the economic system, we deeply experience 
the necessity for reforming the political system. Without the 
political structural reform, there will be no guarantee for 
making achievements in reforming the economic system. If we 
cannot continuously promote the reform of the economic system, 
the development of the productive forces and the realization of 
the four modernizations will be obstructed." Comrade Xiaoping's 
inference brings to light the obstacles for deepening the reform 
of the economic system, develops the basic Marxist principle 
that the superstructure should suit the economic foundation, and 
clearly points out the orientation of reform. 
  12. Grasp with two hands and be tough with both hands. This 
is Comrade Xiaoping's consistent idea. In Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Comrade Xiaoping 
repeatedly pointed out: "We should grasp with two hands. One 
hand is the economic policy on opening to the outside world and 
enlivening the domestic economy. The other hand is to 
resolutely deal blows to various kinds of economic criminal 
activities." "There must be two hands in promoting the four 
modernizations. The four modernizations cannot be realized with 
only one hand. The two hands indicate that we should grasp 
construction with one hand and grasp the legal system with the 
other." "We should grasp reform and opening up with one hand 
and grasp the struggle against various criminal activities with 
the other. These two hands must be tough." This indicates that 
"Grasping with two hands has become a key strategic principle 
and task for building socialism with Chinese characteristics." 
  13. One country, two systems. This is an idea put forward 
to resolve the Taiwan and Hong Kong issues. Comrade Xiaoping 
pointed out: "One country, two systems, specifically means in 
the PRC, to implement the socialist system in the mainland with 
a population of 1 billion and to implement the capitalist system 
in Hong Kong and Taiwan." The idea of "one country, two 
systems" is an example of Comrade Xiaoping's creative 
development of Marxism and an important development of the 
theory of the state--the political and theoretical core of 
Marxism. His pioneering work will not only create a new 
situation for China's great cause of reunification but also 
exert a far-reaching historical influence on the peaceful 
undertakings of the entire world. 
  14. Check turmoil and prevent peaceful evolution. Comrade 
Xiaoping pointed out: "China's four modernizations will not 
succeed without a stable political environment," "all the things 
that oppose and hinder our taking the socialist road and all the 
factors leading to chaos and even turmoil in China should be 
eliminated," and "a need for stability is an issue above all 
other issues in China, and, without a stable environment, 
nothing will be accomplished, and the achievements already won 
will also be lost." Comrade Xiaoping also pointed out: "The 
Western countries are fighting a third world war without the 
smoke of gunpowder, meaning the peaceful evolution of socialist 
countries," and "therefore, we should educate well our Army, our 
organs of dictatorship, Communist party members, the masses, and 
youths." As time goes by, the lessons in the disturbance of 
some countries, China's political and social stability, and the 
development experiences in people's living and working in peace 
and contentment have all the more proved Comrade Xiaoping's 
viewpoints to be scientific and truthful. 
  15. Be on the alert against right tendencies, but mainly 
guard against left tendencies. Comrade Xiaoping said during the 
past 10 years: "We should oppose both `leftism' and rightism 
when emancipating the mind," "but the largest danger comes from 
`left' tendencies," and "right tendencies may ruin socialism, 
and so may `left' tendencies; and China should be on the alert 
against right tendencies but should mainly guard against `left' 
tendencies." Comrade Xiaoping's theory summarizes the historical 
experiences and lessons of China's revolution and construction, 
exposes the extremely great danger of the "left" tendencies that 
are seemingly revolutionary, and clearly points out the major 
tendencies we should guard against in the process of reform, 
opening up, and the modernization drive. It pinpoints the 
current problems and has a far-reaching guiding significance. 
  16. Adhere to the party's basic line without wavering for 
100 
years. Comrade Xiaoping repeatedly emphasized during the past 
10 years: "We should tell the world that no one can change the 
principles, policies, and strategies that we have now 
formulated," "the basic line, principles, and policies we have 
formulated should be continued and unswervingly carried on," 
"not only should the current leaders adhere to them, but also 
the leaders to serve the next terms of office should adhere to 
them," and "the basic line should take charge for 100 years 
without wavering." The party's basic line represents the 
precious experience gained by the CPC by summarizing both the 
positive and negative experiences and lessons during the decades 
of practice in the revolution it led millions of people to 
carried out. It is the lifeline of our party and is where the 
basic interests of Chinese people lie. Comrade Xiaoping's call 
for keeping the party's basic line unchanged for 100 years which 
he issued after careful consideration is an immediate need in 
China's reform and development and also a need in China's 
marching toward the 21st century. 
  17. Peace and development are two major topics of the 
present world. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "One of the really 
big issues of the present world which are of global strategic 
importance is the issue of peace and the other is the economic 
issue or we may call it the development issue. The issue of 
peace is one concerning the East and the West and the issue of 
development is one concerning the South and the North. We can 
summarize them into four words-- East, West, South and North." 
This figurative summation of Comrade Xiaoping has great 
foresight, scientifically analyzed the development and changes 
in the world situation after the war, promptly made theoretical 
analysis that conforms with the objective trend of the 
development situation, provided a reliable guarantee for our 
country to develop foreign relations and to seize the 
opportunity to develop itself, and it is becoming a common 
understanding of the whole world and the common task facing the 
whole world. 
  18. We should view the international situation soberly, try 
to maintain our position, and cope with it calmly. In September 
1989, in face of the sudden changes in the world pattern, such 
as the great changes in East Europe, the disintegration of the 
Soviet Union, and the reunification of East and West Germany, 
Comrade Xiaoping said earnestly to several central responsible 
comrades: "Regarding the international situation, we can 
summarize it into three sentences. The first is to view it 
soberly; second, try to maintain our position; and third, cope 
with it calmly. We must not be impatient because impatience may 
lead to failure. We must be calm, quietly immerse ourselves in 
practical work, and accomplish one affair, our own affair." 
This is one of the important aspects of the political briefing 
which Comrade Deng Xiaoping gave to leaders of the new 
generation of our country after he accumulated the experiences 
gained during scores of years of domestic and international 
struggles, and is a basic stand which our country should uphold 
during a considerable long period of external struggle, and has 
been proven by practice over recent years that it is a correct 
foreign principle. 
  19. The crucial issue of China is to internationally improve 
the Communist party. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "China's 
problem will come from inside the Communist party. We must 
approach this issue soberly, pay attention to training 
personnel, and select people of ability and political integrity 
into the leading bodies in line with the criterion of selecting 
revolutionary, young, well- educated and vocationally proficient 
cadres. We should rely on this point if we want to uphold the 
basic line the party has kept for 100 years and maintain a long 
period of peace and stability. This is an affair that really 
affects the overall situation." "In the final analysis, the 
crucial issue is to improve the Communist party inside. If 
nothing happens we may sleep at ease." Comrade Xiaoping's 
directives have exposed where the key and the vital part of the 
problems of China lie, and provided a major task for party 
building. 
  20. We should strengthen the building of politics and fight 
corruption. During recent years, Comrade Xiaoping unceasingly 
stressed: "We should do several things that satisfy the people. 
There are two aspects. One is to boldly conduct reform and 
opening up, and the other is to step up efforts to fight 
corruption." "To rectify our party and realize our strategic 
objective, there will really be the danger of failure if we fail 
to fight corruption, in particular, the corrupt phenomena in the 
upper layer of the party." "Facts show that the Communist party 
is capable of eliminating repulsive things. We should fight 
corruption during the whole course of reform and opening up. 
As far as cadres and Communist party members are concerned, 
they should grasp the building of clean politics as a major 
affair." Comrade Xiaoping expounded the major significance of 
conducting anticorruption struggle from the perspective of the 
party's life and death, which is a new development of the 
Marxist theory on party building. 
  Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping 
has many new ideas and new viewpoints which I will no longer 
list here one by one. 
<H3>  In Studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, We Should Have a Good Command of and Make Clear 
Some Major Issues </H3>
  In studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, we should give prominence to focal points, grasp 
the essentials, and make clear some major issues in line with 
realities. What major issues on earth should we center in 
conducting study and discussion and how should we combine the 
study and discussion with the realities of ideology and work? 
For this, Comrade Shan Rongfan will set forth demands on behalf 
of the provincial party committee. Here, I will only make a 
report on my personal experience in study. 
  1. Emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts 
constitute the quintessence of all theoretical viewpoints of 
Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. 
When meeting with foreign guests, Comrade Xiaoping appraised 
himself as the "group of seeking truth from facts." In the 
beginning chapter of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping, Comrade Xiaoping demanded us for the first 
time to "take our own road and to build socialism with China's 
own characteristics." From the very beginning of this book, he 
expounded the ideological line of "seeking truth from facts and 
proceeding from reality in doing everything," that was always 
advocated by him. In the concluding chapter, namely, the 
world-famous important speeches made during his south China 
trip, he repeatedly stressed: "Seeking truth from facts 
constitutes the quintessence of Marxism." "I have not read many 
books. But, I have always believed what Chairman Mao said is 
realistic." "Without a little spirit of being fearless and 
without a little spirit of rush advance, we will be unable to 
beat a good and new path and to pioneer a new cause." This has 
again gone back to the quintessence of "emancipating the mind 
and seeking truth from facts," that runs through the whole book. 
  Comrade Xiaoping is the pioneer of the emancipation of the 
mind. He pointed out: "What we are engaged in now is a new 
cause. It has not been mentioned by Marx, has not been engaged 
in by our ancestors, and has not been engaged in by other 
socialist countries. Therefore, there are no ready experiences 
for us to learn from." "Marxism should develop, and socialism 
should also develop, developing along with the development of 
the practice of human society and with the development of 
science." In his guidance to the great practice of reform, 
opening up, and modernization drive, he stressed: "We should 
not only refrain from copying the methods of Western capitalist 
countries but also refrain from copying the methods of other 
socialist countries;" "many problems cannot be tackled with old 
methods;" and "we should boldly try a thing and go ahead." 
Otherwise, "daring not to emancipate the mind and daring not to 
untie our hands will result in missing opportunity, just like 
the saying "a boat sailing against the current must forth ahead 
or it will be driven back." When the household output-related 
contract system displayed its advantages for the first time, 
Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "Becoming rich is not a sin. It 
can be affirmed as a very good policy. When the individual and 
private sectors of the economy and the three types of 
foreign-funded enterprises met with reproach for competing with 
state-owned enterprises, Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: 
"Developing a little individual sector of the economy and 
attracting foreign enterprises to run plants in China constitute 
the complement to the socialist economy." When the economy of 
special zones was much debated by the people, Comrade Xiaoping 
solemnly answered: "Special zones constitute the window, the 
window of technology, the window of management, the window of 
knowledge, and the window of opening up policy." "Special zones 
are the new thing of socialism. Special zones are of socialism 
but not of capitalism." When some people and some localities 
became rich ahead of others and some people could not accept 
them, Comrade Xiaoping stressed: "We stress on common wealth 
but also allow differences." It is impossible to develop 
equally. The thing will be easier if we let some localities 
become rich first and then make them help the poor." With a 
profound understanding of the interest and aspirations of the 
people, with a correct command of the law of the development of 
things, and with a flexible application of the 
Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Though, Comrade Xiaoping gave a 
clear and correct answer to the major questions concerning the 
overall situation of reform, opening up, and economic 
construction, and greatly promoted the emancipation of the mind 
throughout the party. 
  Comrade Xiaoping is a model in seeking truth from facts. He 
pointed out: To emancipate the mind, we should have our ideas 
conform to the objective reality, seek truth from facts, proceed 
from reality to do everything, and proceed from the actual 
conditions of China and the world. Comrade Xiaoping thoroughly 
analyzed the actual conditions of China and the world. He 
pointed out that the greatest reality of China is that China is 
in the initial stage of socialism where the productive forces 
are not well developed and that the great reality of the world 
is that peace and development become the main subjects, there 
will be no world war in a longer period of time, and we can 
strive for a peaceful international environment that is 
conducive to the domestic construction. Just in line with these 
two greatest realities, Comrade Xiaoping set forth the 
"political line of boldly, wholeheartedly, and perfectly 
developing the four modernization;" the key policy on grasping 
favorable opportunities and making self-development; and the 
basic state policy on reform and opening up. In regard to the 
unprecedented reform undertaking, Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: 
"Our policy is to be bold enough, make stable steps, and take 
one step and look around before taking another." "The key is to 
be good at summing up experiences and avoid making big 
mistakes." Whenever reform has been developed for a period of 
time, Comrade Xiaoping constantly exhorts the whole party: 
"Now, it is time to look back. We have to see what has been 
done right and what has been done wrong so as to decide the 
next-step reform work." Here, Comrade Xiaoping organically 
combined emancipating the mind and boldly blazing new trails 
with seeking truth from facts and respecting the objective law 
and fostered a brilliant example for the whole party to persist 
in the ideological line of "emancipating the mind and seeking 
truth from facts." 
  Proceeding from the reality of the province and using 
Xiaoping's theory to arm our heads, emancipate the mind, and 
renew our ideas in the historical turn of setting up the 
socialist market economic system is of prominent necessity and 
urgency. Our productive force development level lags behind 
that of the advanced areas. Therefore, we must eliminate the 
fixed ideas of doing everything according to books and 
proceeding from the traditional socialist ideas and principles 
and foster the new idea that emancipating and developing 
productive forces is the essential characteristics, fundamental 
purpose, and fundamental standard of socialism. The state-owned 
sector of the economy accounts for an excessive large proportion 
of the economy in the province. Thus, the existing managerial 
forms lack vitality. We must eliminate the traditional public 
ownership idea characterized by state ownership and state 
management; define various kinds of ownership forms 
characterized by state ownership, collective ownership, 
cooperative ownership, and various sectors of ownership; define 
various kinds of property organizational forms characterized by 
independent investment, shareholding system, and shareholding 
cooperative system; and define the public ownership idea where 
ownership is separated from the property right of legal persons. 
Along with the promulgation of the state key reform measures in 
1994, we must change the existing forms to regulate and control 
the administrative distribution of loans, tax reduction and 
exemption, and the readjustment of contract base figures; and 
define the regulation and control ideas of separating government 
functions from enterprise management, capital, and business 
dominated by indirect means. Under the circumstances where 
reform measures should be standardized by laws, we must change 
the policy idea characterized by a policy for a piece of land 
and a policy for a plant and the policy idea of development in 
reliance on reducing taxes, conceding profits, and special 
preferential policies; and define the policy idea of creating 
equal competition conditions to enliven the mainstay of markets. 
Under the new situation of carrying out the market economic 
system, we must eliminate the inherent ideas that land is not a 
commodity, labor forces are not able to enter markets, and 
socialism does not have capital category and foster a market 
idea that all production factors, such as land, labor forces, 
capital, and property rights, can be circulated and exchanged. 
Under the new situation of further opening to the outside 
world, we must eliminate the managerial form, method, and 
traditional idea of totalling excluding capitalism and define 
the open idea of handling affairs according to the general 
market economic laws and the international practice. 
  2. What socialism is and how socialism with Chinese 
characteristics should be built are the theme of the third 
volume of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping." In the 
eighties, Comrade Xiaoping took the overall situation, the 
reality, and the future into consideration and meditated, in 
retrospect, why the Soviet Union's pattern was not desirable, 
why there was evolution and disintegration later, and why 
Comrade Mao Zedong encountered setbacks one after another during 
his later years in his exploration on the practice of the "three 
red banners" and the continued revolution under the dictatorship 
of the proletariat. In his speeches given when meeting with 
foreign guests, Comrade Xiaoping repeatedly said: "Even the 
Soviet Union failed to completely clarify what socialism is like 
after many years' of efforts," "the Soviet Union's pattern later 
became ossified," "our past understanding of what socialism and 
Marxism are was not totally clear," "it is all right to decide 
to take the socialist road, but we should first understand what 
socialism is," "a problem in understanding Marxism and socialism 
has existed for many years," "we have not clarified how to 
understand and develop Marxism in changing conditions," and 
"people who do not inherit and develop Marxism with new ideas 
and new viewpoints are not true Marxists." When talking with 
some central responsible comrades before the 13th party 
congress, he once again pointed out: "The report to the 13th 
party congress should provide a theoretical exposition on what 
socialism is and should clearly explain whether our reform is 
socialist." We can see that Volume 3 of the Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping, where the theme of what socialism 
is and how socialism with Chinese characteristics should be 
built appears repeatedly from the beginning to the end, is 
continuously developed in content and deepened in ideology and 
shows ever enhanced understanding of laws. According to my 
understanding, the reason why Comrade Xiaoping painstakingly 
considered and repeatedly emphasized this theme was that the 
detours and mistakes we had experienced before reform and 
opening up started and the misgivings and doubts we experienced 
after reform and opening up started, in the final analysis, 
resulted from our failure to thoroughly clarify this question. 
After the initial study of the third volume, I feel that, to 
clearly understand this theme, we should clarify the following 
basic theoretical questions: 
  Why do we develop socialism? This question concerns the 
origin and non-origin of change in the socialist system. 
Historical materialism holds that productive forces are the 
ultimate decisive force in the development of human society. 
The reason the socialist system will unavoidably replace the 
capitalist system lies not in its conformity to "eternal truth 
and justice." The reason is, just as Marx said, that the 
capitalist system has become the "shackles of production forms 
that were developed, that the concentration of the means of 
production and the socialization of labor have reached an extent 
incompatible with their capitalist shell, and that the shell 
will soon blow up." (Das Kapital, Vol 3) This is to 
say that the development of productive forces is the original, 
first, and ultimate decisive factor, and socialism, as a social 
system, is the non-original and second factor decided by the 
development productive forces. It is just like Engels pointed 
out that socialism is an inevitable demand when the development 
of productive forces has reached a certain stage. In addition, 
"it is possible to develop socialism only when the development 
of productive forces has reached a certain stage and when the 
practical conditions for realizing it are all ready (from 
socialist ideal to scientific development). Comrade Xiaoping 
has profoundly understood this historical dialectical 
quintessence and pointed out: "Although we have conducted 
socialism, actually we are not up to standard. Only when we 
enter the middle part of the next century and reach the level of 
a moderately developed country can we say that we have really 
conducted socialism." When he met with presidents of Tanzania 
and Uganda, he said: "According to your own conditions, 
perhaps, you should not be too anxious to engage in socialism 
right now." He said that we are "actually not up to standard" to 
carry out socialism at present, and that we should not be "too 
anxious to carry out socialism." This is implied to the fact 
that our conditions are not ready for developing the productive 
forces. This has clearly told us that our purpose of carrying 
out socialism is to develop the productive forces and that we 
should not develop the productive forces for the sake of 
socialism. In terms of the objective law of the development of 
human society, this has strategically and thoroughly solved the 
most basic issue of why we engage in socialism. 
  What is socialism? There is an issue of the essential and 
nonessential aspects of socialism. For a long time, the people 
have believed that the essence of socialism is public ownership, 
planned economy, distribution according to work, and later, the 
dictatorship of the proletariat, the party's leadership and 
spiritual civilization. From the perspective of the times, 
Comrade Xiaoping introduced for the first time the idea of 
productive forces to the essence of socialism in the history of 
development of Marxism, explicitly proposed that the essence of 
socialism is to "emancipate and develop the productive forces, 
eliminate exploitation and polarization and finally lead to 
common prosperity." This thesis has ended all kinds of 
distortion and erroneous understanding of the essence of 
socialism, eliminated some principles, forms, and methods that 
do not belong to the essence of socialism. Of this, the 
principles of public ownership and distribution according to 
work are determined and served by the essence of socialism, and 
are essential to the essence of socialism, and therefore, they 
are correct and must be upheld; there are also some principles, 
forms, and methods, such as the planned economy, are not needed 
by the essence of socialism, and, therefore, they are not 
necessary to be upheld. In addition, some principles, forms and 
methods, such as the commodity economy, the market economy, and 
the shareholding system, that conform with the demands of the 
essence of socialism or cause no harms to the essence of 
socialism must be used for reference and be applied. For a long 
time, we have been used to regarding some things that are not 
the essence of socialism as the essence of socialism and upheld 
them, and regarding things that meet the demands of the essence 
of socialism, such as the family-based contracting system and 
reform of property right system, as "heretical beliefs," and 
opposed them. The reason for this is that we have failed to 
completely clarify the essence of socialism. The thesis of 
Comrade Xiaoping on the essence of socialism has scientifically 
answered the basic question of what is socialism. This is a big 
emancipation of the ideology of the communist people and a major 
breakthrough of the scientific socialist theory. 
  How should socialism be developed? This question concerns 
the purpose and means of socialism. According to Comrade 
Xiaoping's thesis on the nature of socialism, the purpose of 
socialism is to "ultimately achieve common prosperity," and all 
others are the means. This idea of Comrade Xiaoping's took 
shape as early as the 1960's. His famous talk on "cat," namely 
"regarding the best form of production relation, we should have 
an attitude of adopting whatever forms that can fairly easily 
and rapidly restore and develop agricultural production in a 
locality," and "all cats, white or black, are good cats as long 
as they catch mice," profoundly brought to light in extremely 
simple language the relations between the purpose and means of 
socialism. That is, we may adopt whatever means that helps 
develop productive forces and ultimately achieve common 
prosperity. In Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, Comrade Xiaoping repeatedly emphasized that the 
ultimate purpose of socialism is common prosperity, "poverty is 
not socialism, nor is too sluggish a development," "we adopt all 
methods that help develop productive forces, including bringing 
in capital and advanced technology from abroad," and "many 
operating forms are the means and methods for developing 
productive forces, which can be adopted by both capitalism and 
socialism, and they serve those who use them well." After 
studying Comrade Xiaoping's theses, I feel that we should truly 
break with the outdated concept of persisting in means by 
regarding it as the purpose and sticking to the means at the 
expense of the purpose and should never again do such a silly 
thing as "pursuing the weed of socialism rather than the 
seedlings of capitalism." We should truly take development as 
the essential criterion ad proceed from and aim at developing 
Heilongjiang and making the people prosper in doing everything. 
  3. Introducing the market economy system to the socialist 
society is a major breakthrough and innovation of the theory of 
scientific socialism that Volume 3 of the Selected Works 
of Deng Xiaoping has made, and it blazes a road for China's 
socialist modernization that conforms to the objective law 
governing socialized large-scale production. The traditional 
concept on socialism held that the market economy was the basic 
characteristic of capitalism and only the planned economy is the 
intrinsic attribute of socialism, and, therefore, the market 
economy was not for socialism. With the dauntless courage and 
insight of a proletarian revolutionary, Comrade Xiaoping 
challenged the traditional concept on the relationship between 
planning and the market. He pointed out as early as 1979 that 
"the market economy may also be developed in socialism." In 
Volume 3, he again spoke on the issue of market on seven or 
eight occasions: "There is no basic contradictions between 
socialism and the market economy," "to have more planning or to 
have more market force is not the basic difference between 
socialism and capitalism," "planning and the market are all 
economic means," and "it is necessary to persistently combine 
the planned economy with the market economy." Comrade 
Xiaoping's theses have laid a theoretical foundation for the 
socialist market economy. 
  Engaging in the socialist market economy is an essential 
demand in socialized mass production. Comrade Xiaoping 
maintained: "Marxism stresses development of productive forces 
the most." Attempting to "build all state organizations into a 
large machine and into an economic organism whereby hundreds of 
millions of people work in accordance with a single plan," 
(Lenin) has made enterprises become "dead spare parts" of this 
"large machine" and restrained the source of social wealth under 
the conditions of modernized and socialized mass production, has 
given rise to unwieldy, overstaffed, and low-efficiency 
managerial organizations and skewed the proportion in various 
economic sectors off balance; and affected by interests of 
respective localities and departments, has caused serious 
barriers between different regions and different departments, 
hampered the rational flow and optimum organization of 
production elements, and caused sharp contradictions to the 
socialist mass production. After summarizing the experiences 
and lessons gained from history, Comrade Xiaoping repeatedly 
stressed that the planned economy was no longer workable. "In 
the past, we copied the modes of other countries, thus hampering 
the development of productive forces." "Old methods have been 
proven ineffective by practice in the past tens of years." 
Then, he pointed out: "Combining the planned economy with the 
market economy will be conducive to liberating productive forces 
and accelerating the development of productive forces." 
  Engaging in the socialist market economy conforms to the 
aspirations of the people and the demand of the essence of 
socialism. Comrade Xiaoping has always combined the people's 
aspirations with the essence of socialism. He maintained that 
only liberating and developing productive forces and achieving 
common prosperity conform to the fundamental interests of the 
people. He also maintained that only by fully mobilizing the 
initiative of the people could we liberate and develop 
productive forces. Therefore, in approaching a thing, Comrade 
Xiaoping has always considered "whether the people support it," 
"whether the people agree to it," "whether the people are 
happy," and "whether the people favor it." In the past, we 
continuously propagated that laborers were masters of the means 
of production. However, under the highly centralized planned 
system, enterprises were the accessories of party and government 
organs, staff and workers were passive executors of the 
mandatory targets of production, staff and workers ate from the 
"common big pot" of enterprises, and enterprises ate from the 
"common big pot" of the state. As a result, enterprises could 
not feel that they were the mainstay of management, laborers 
also could not feel that they were masters of their enterprises, 
and thus their enthusiasm was seriously dampened. In the light 
of this situation, Comrade Xiaoping sharply pointed out: 
"Refusing to delegate powers to enterprises, enterprises will 
have no autonomy and will no responsibilities to assume, and the 
state must assume responsibilities for both success and failure. 
If the state takes on everything, how can we do our work well 
and mobilize initiative? Implementation of the socialist market 
economy will give rise to a pattern characterized by diverse 
investment mainstays, diverse ownership forms, diverse 
distribution forms, and diverse asset management forms. Under 
this pattern, laborers are either owners of individual and 
private enterprises or shareholders of shareholding enterprises 
and shareholding cooperative enterprises, or staff and workers, 
who are closely linked with the destiny of their enterprises, of 
the wholly state-funded enterprises that enjoy the property 
right of legal persons. Under any circumstance, all laborers 
will become masters of their enterprises in gaining property 
right and in sharing personal interest, and then we will enhance 
the labor productive forces to the maximum and accelerate the 
speed of marching towards common prosperity. From this, we can 
see that only by developing the socialist market economy can we 
meet the demand of the essence of socialism. 
  Developing the socialist market economy is the inexorable 
direction of reform and opening up. A basic idea dominating the 
third volume is to break with the closed economy and open to the 
outside world. When considering the issue of reform, Comrade 
Xiaoping also proceeded from the idea of opening up. He said: 
"Reform is meant to invigorate the economy, and invigorating 
the domestic economy means to open to other localities of the 
country, and this is, in reality, called the open policy," and 
"the basic content and basic experience of both the rural reform 
and the urban reform are to open up." He also repeatedly 
emphasized: "Courage is needed to raise the banner of further 
opening up." How should we open further? The situation is very 
clear -- over 90 percent of the countries and regions in the 
world are enforcing the market economy system. If we become an 
"isolated island" of planned economy, it will be very difficult 
for us to further march toward the world. Only when we develop 
the market economy and act according to international practice, 
can we "connect" with the market economy which is universally 
implemented in the current world and coordinate China's economy 
with the economy of the world. 
  4. Attending to two tasks simultaneously and being competent 
in both constitute the basic principle repeatedly emphasized in 
Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. 
Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "We should pay close attention to 
and never, even on a single day, slacken efforts in building the 
spiritual civilization and improving party style and social 
conduct," and "what is the sense of succeeding in economic 
development if social conduct deteriorates? Deterioration in 
the other area will lead to the deterioration of the entire 
economy." He repeatedly emphasized that in building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, it is necessary to develop reform 
and opening up on the one hand and punish corruption on the 
other, develop economic construction on the one hand and improve 
democracy and the legal system on the other, and build the 
material civilization on the one hand and develop the spiritual 
civilization on the other; and that "not only should the economy 
be developed, but social order and social conduct should also be 
improved and the two civilizations should surpass those in the 
capitalist countries. Only this is socialism with Chinese 
characteristics." Only when we use patriotism and socialism to 
unite the Chinese nation, uplift our national spirit, and 
enhance all the people's national self-respect, self-confidence, 
and self-pride, can we develop our country and our nation. 
  To understand Comrade Xiaoping's idea of attending to two 
tasks simultaneously, we should strengthen party building and 
the spiritual civilization in line with reality, bring about a 
turn for the better in public security and social conduct, unite 
the people throughout the country, raise spirits, work hard, and 
develop Heilongjiang.

<F P=106> [Statement by Hong Kong Governor Christopher Patten to </F>
members of the Legislative Council at the Legislative Council 
Chamber in Hong Kong--live] 
  [Text] Mr. President [Legislative Council President John 
Swaine], I would like to begin my reporting to members on my 
recent visit to Australia. I paid an official visit to 
Australia at the invitation of the Australian Government from 
13-19 February. I am very grateful to the Australian Government 
for the invitation and for arranging the visit so well and so 
generously. 
  Australia is an important trading partner for Hong Kong. 
Three hundred Australian companies operate here, employing 
70,000 Hong Kong people. Total trade between us rose 12 percent 
last year. Hong Kong is Australia's seventh largest export 
market and tenth largest trading partner overall. There are 
growing human contacts between our communities. Almost 10,000 
Hong Kong students are studying in Australia, with a large 
number of Australians teaching at our own universities. Twenty 
thousand Australians live and work in Hong Kong, and some 80,000 
people from Hong Kong now live and work in Australia. Over 
300,000 Australians visited Hong Kong last year and over 120,000 
Hong Kong people visited Australia. My visit took in Sydney, 
Canberra, and Melbourne. I had good meetings with Prime 
Minister Keating in Sydney and the minister for foreign affairs, 
Senator Evans, in Canberra. I also had meetings with the 
governor general, Mr. Hayden, the governors of the states of New 
South Wales and Victoria, as well as with the premier of New 
South Wales and the deputy premier of Victoria. I made four 
public speeches and I visited a number of companies doing 
considerable business with us here in Hong Kong. I encouraged 
firms not already active here to consider using Hong Kong as a 
regional base. Equally, I was able to provide reassurances to 
those firms that are here that Hong Kong would continue to be an 
excellent place to do business. Everywhere I went I found 
enormous warmth and understanding among Australians, in 
government and outside it, for Hong Kong. And I found as well a 
great deal of goodwill for Hong Kong's future. Australia is a 
good friend to Hong Kong. We warmly appreciate and value the 
ties of friendship and trade that link our communities. I hope 
those ties will grow in the months and years ahead. 
  Turning now to developments closer to home, I was very 
pleased to see that this Council last night passed the 
legislation dealing with the less controversial elements 
relating to the arrangements for the elections in 1994 and 1995. 
This was the second bill relating to the 1994 and 1995 
elections, which the Legislative Council has now passed. After 
we first put forward proposals in October 1992, we made it clear 
that we were keen to discuss them with the Chinese side. 
Unfortunately, talks did not begin before we had to legislate 
on the Boundary and Election Commission. That body is now 
established and doing very good work. 
  Talks did begin in April 1993, but regrettably it was not 
possible to reach agreement before time pressure meant we had to 
press on with the next stage of legislation, which the Council 
has just passed. The voting age and voting method for all three 
tiers of elections are now agreed, so too the abolition of 
appointed membership of district boards and municipal councils. 
This means that we now have a proportion of the necessary 
legislation in place, and we are ready to move on to the next 
stage. The fact that this legislation, the less controversial 
part, has taken some two and a half months to pass through this 
Council, underlines how fine we have been cutting things. 
  We now have only four months left in which to pass the 
remaining legislation. We need to have that through by the time 
this Council rises in July. It is our firm aim to do so. We 
had hoped that it would be possible for the talks with China to 
resume. We have since last November, repeatedly asked the 
Chinese to continue talks on the outstanding issues. There have 
been innumerable such requests on diplomatic channels, including 
a message from the British prime minister to the Chinese 
premier. As you know, China was only willing to do so on 
condition that the first stage bill was withdrawn. That was not 
possible. Time is now pressing. If we are to have the 
legislation through in time to enable us to hold elections in 
good order and on schedule, we therefore need now to proceed 
with the third bill without delay. We intend to gazette the 
remaining legislation, that dealing with the arrangements for 
the Election Committee and functional constituencies, tomorrow, 
25 February, and to introduce it to this Council on 9 March. 
This decision has been taken following full consultations with 
the Executive Council and with ministers, who agree with this 
approach. 
  The legislation which we will publish tomorrow will contain 
in, legislative form, the proposals which I put forward in 
October 1992 for the functional constituencies and the election 
committee. It will propose an election committee composed of 
members of district boards. It will propose that the nine new 
functional constituencies envisaged under the Basic Law should 
be made up of members of the entire work force. And it will 
propose the abolition of corporate voting in existing functional 
constituencies. Members will recall that I have promised on many 
occasions that if it became necessary for us to proceed with the 
remaining legislation without Chinese agreement, Hong Kong 
people would be entitled to expect an explanation of why that 
was necessary and why we believe it to be in the best interests 
of Hong Kong. The British Government will, therefore, today be 
publishing a White Paper, setting out the background to the 
present position, the approach which the British side took in 
the negotiations with China, and the modifications which we were 
prepared to make to the Hong Kong Government's 1992 proposals as 
part of an overall agreement, including on the through train. 
It is a thorough, factual account. The White Paper will be 
published at 5:00 pm this afternoon. Its publication is 
essential to informed debate in Parliament, in this Legislative 
Council, and in the community. 
  Let me say a word about why we have chosen to recommend to 
this Council, the Government's original 1992 proposals. We 
believed then, and we still believe, that these proposals are 
the best ones on the table. They have been debated at length 
and already endorsed in general terms on three occasions by this 
Council. These proposals have enjoyed widespread and consistent 
support amongst most sections of the community. We continue to 
regard them as the best way to secure our objective of open and 
fair elections. We were prepared to offer during the 
negotiations, modifications to our 1992 proposals to secure an 
overall agreement with China, including on the through train. 
Although it is has not proved possible to reach such an 
agreement, we obviously stand by those modified proposals as a 
way to produce open and fair elections, albeit a less attractive 
way in our view than our original proposals. Plainly the 
judgment on these matters now lies with the Legislative Council. 
That has always been the constitutional position. For our part, 
we shall argue strongly for the legislation we are now putting 
forward. The proposals it contains were deliberately framed to 
be consistent with the Joint Declaration, the Basic Law, and the 
relevant agreements and understandings between the two sides. 
We firmly believe that they are, and we are supported in that 
view by the overwhelming majority of independent legal opinion. 
  I want to say to this Council and to the community how much 
I 
regret that we have not managed to reach agreement with China on 
these very difficult electoral issues. I fervently wish we 
could have done so. But I equally fervently believe that it 
would have been wrong to abandon the principles we have set out 
for the sake of an agreement which would not have been in the 
best interests of Hong Kong. 
  The White Paper sets out clearly the issues which were, and 
which are, at stake here. I regard it as my overriding 
responsibility, faithfully to implement the terms of the Joint 
Declaration on which the concept of one country, two systems is 
based. The Joint Declaration promises a legislature constituted 
by elections to which the executive shall be accountable. I 
take that to mean real elections in which Hong Kong people have 
a genuine choice. As I have explained many times before, it is 
upon a credible Legislative Council, openly and fairly elected, 
that so many of our other freedoms and institutions depend. So 
we differ with China on this important point about the 
elections. But it does not follow that we have to argue with 
China about everything. Let us try to draw a line under this 
dispute and cooperate together in other areas in the interests 
of the people of Hong Kong. We now have less than three and a 
half years left before the transition, and there is a great deal 
of work to do. For our part, for Britain's, and for Hong 
Kong's, we stand willing and able to work together with China in 
Hong Kong's interests on other matters, even if on this 
admittedly important one, it has unfortunately not proved 
possible to do so.

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Lu Yansong (0712 1484 2646): "Russia </F>
Takes Active Part in Mediation in Bosnia Conflict"] 
  [Text] In the early morning of 21 February, NATO announced 
that it would temporarily stop the execution of its planned air 
strikes against Serb positions around Sarajevo. A tense 
situation that lasted more than 10 days was eventually 
mitigated, and people might be able to relax a little. Public 
opinion holds that Russia played an important role in settling 
the Sarajevo crisis. 
  On 9 February, NATO issued an ultimatum demanding that the 
Bosnian Serbs withdraw their heavy weapons from areas around 
Sarajevo before the deadline; otherwise, NATO would launch air 
strikes against their positions. After NATO issued the 
ultimatum, Russia reacted rapidly. Foreign Minister Kozyrev 
sent a letter to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, explicitly 
expressing Russia's opposition to the NATO action. Then, Russia 
carried out a series of diplomatic activities, and reiterated 
again and again its position on peacefully settling the conflict 
in Bosnia and Herzegovina within the ambit of the United 
Nations. On 15 February, Russian President Yeltsin pointed out 
after meeting with British Prime Minister Major that Russia must 
not be excluded from the process of settling the conflict in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. On 16 February, Russian Vice Foreign 
Minister Churkin, as the Russian president's special envoy, flew 
to Belgrade and continued to influence the Serb leaders and 
conveyed to them President Yeltsin's new proposal on settling 
the Bosnia crisis. The proposal not only satisfied the 
requirements of the NATO ultimatum, but also gave a sense of 
security to the Serbs and was acceptable to them. Russia's 
mediation broke the impasse between the Serbs and NATO. On 17 
February, Bosnian Serb leader Karadzic announced that they had 
accepted Russia's new proposals on settling the crisis, and had 
begun to withdraw their heavy weaponry in large quantities from 
positions around Sarajevo. At the same time, Russia dispatched 
400 troops stationed in Croatia to Sarajevo to participate in 
the peacekeeping mission and to help supervise the Serb 
withdrawal. On 20 February, President Yeltsin and President 
Clinton reached an agreement in principle in a telephone 
conversation, thus avoiding imminent air strikes. 
  Public opinion held that Russia opposed air strikes against 
the Bosnian Serbs and played an active mediating role in the 
Bosnia conflicts mainly due to the following considerations. 
First, Russia held that the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
could only be solved by political means, and air strikes would 
only intensify the military conflict and damage the Bosnian 
peace process. Second, air strikes would be NATO's first 
military action outside its defensive sphere since its founding. 
As the new European pattern has not yet taken form since the 
end of the Cold War, Russia held that this event would be 
extremely unfavorable to itself in strategic terms. Third, in 
history, Russia has had its own interests in the Balkan 
Peninsula. Russians and the Serbs are both Slavs, and both hold 
the religious beliefs of the Eastern Orthodox Church. The two 
nations have traditionally had close ties. If Russia sat idly 
by and did not care about the Serbs mired in a predicament, its 
influence in the Balkan Peninsula would be greatly weakened. 
  In the last two years, Russia has always tried to coordinate 
its position with the Western countries in the course of 
approaching problems in former Yugoslavia, and has sometimes 
even made concessions. In May last year, the "Russian program" 
for settling the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina was turned into 
a "five-nation program" of Russia, the United States, Britain, 
France, and Spain through consultations and compromises. This 
was clear evidence of Russia's position. However, this time, 
Russia resolutely opposed NATO's planned air strikes. The 
foreign press held that this reflected Russia's new diplomatic 
tendency. 
  After NATO set aside its air-strike plan, the Sarajevo 
crisis 
has temporarily eased, but the overall situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina remains extremely serious. However, people 
have noticed that Russia and the United States have been more 
deeply involved in mediating efforts, and Western European 
countries such as Britain and France had also adjusted their own 
policies to various degrees in the hope that Russia and the 
United States would exert their influence on the Serbs and 
Muslims. Therefore, it seems that a new ray of hope for the 
prospect of a peaceful settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
problem has appeared in people's minds after the end of the 
Sarajevo crisis.

  [Text] Belgrade, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Serb 
military leader Ratko Mladic today accused the west of playing 
power politics against the Serbs by demanding the opening of 
Tuzla airport. 
  The commander of Bosnian Serb armed forces described this 
demand as an attempt to deprive the Serbs of their right to 
self-defense. 
  He told the "Krajina soliders" monthly that Western 
countries 
want the use of Tuzla airport because they intend to provide the 
Bosnian Muslims with large supplies of weapons, ammunition, and 
mercenary troops. 
  At the same time, the military leader said, Serbs are banned 
from transporting the wounded, the elderly, and pregnant women. 
  He pointed out that as a matter of fact, the west does not 
need the use of the airport because they are daily shipping in 
everything the Muslims need over land routes. 
  The West's demand that the Tuzla airport be opened is meant 
to put pressure on the Serbs, he added. 
  The Tuzla airport opening can be put on the agenda only when 
the opening of a Serbian airport is also discussed, he stressed. 
  Mladic views the West as trying to shape the world only in 
ways that comply with their own interests, saying "they have 
torn apart (the former) Yugoslavia, and have been taking every 
repressive measure against the resistance of our people. " 
  On the Sarajevo crisis, the military commander emphasized 
that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had no right to 
issue the ultimatum against the Serbs, who have not launched war 
against anybody. 
  He criticized Western countries for authorizing themselves 
to 
decide which country can survive and how long it can live. 
  Mladic said Serbs will defend themselves if attacked even 
though their heavy weapons are under United Nations control.

  [Text] Almaty, February 24 (XINHUA) -- The Kazakh-U.S 
"partnership for democracy" charter states that if Kazakhstan 
suffers threats to its territorial integrity, political 
independence, or national security, the United States will step 
in to assist in solving the problem. 
  The charter also says the two countries will solve all 
problems peacefully by adopting measures that are in keeping 
with international law and the principles of the "partnership 
for peace" plan of the conference on security and cooperation in 
Europe and NATO. 
  If Kazakhstan is threatened by invasion or nuclear weapons, 
the United States is obliged to appeal to the UN Security 
Council for emergency measures to provide aid for Kazakhstan. 
  The charter also provides for regular talks between 
Kazakhstan and the United States on security, cooperation in 
defense, and increased military exchanges. The United States 
will also assist in Kazakhstan's military training. 
  The charter, signed during Kazakh President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev's visit to the United States February 13-17, 
symbolizes an important step for the two countries toward 
establishing a strategic partnership.

  [Text] Washington, February 24 (XINHUA) -- The United 
States should avoid military confrontation with the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), a U.S. congressionally funded 
think tank said here today. 
  "A negotiating strategy is the most effective approach to 
mobilizing U.S. and allied strengths in dealing with Pyongyang," 
the United States institute of peace said in a report released 
today. 
  The institute, comprised of former senior U.S. officials, 
suggested that at the current time diplomacy represented the 
best option for handling the DPRK nuclear issue. 
  The DPRK has accepted the inspection activities requested by 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in its seven 
nuclear facilities. 
  The DPRK said early inspections by the IAEA depends on 
whether the United States carries its commitment made earlier, 
that is, the U.S. should cancel its annual military exercise 
with South Korea and issue a joint decision with the DPRK on the 
timing of the third round of meetings. 
  Members of the institute said they believe the DPRK's 
success 
in assembling a nuclear weapon had been overblown. 
  The think thank advised the Clinton administration to name a 
senior coordinator to act as the focal point for all dealings 
related to negotiations with the DPRK.

  [Text] Beijing, February 24 (XINHUA) -- The current visit 
of French Senate President Rene Monory to Beijing is seen as a 
good demonstration of China's busy parliamentary diplomacy in 
the past year. 
  Monory, the highest French leader to visit China since the 
normalization of Sino-French relations last month, is the 24th 
foreign parliamentary leader which the National People's 
Congress (NPC), the Chinese version of parliament, has received 
since last March, when the Eighth NPC Standing Committee was 
formed. 
  Also touring China at present are the Italian Senate 
President, the chairman of the Turkmenistan Grand National 
Assembly and the chairman of the Vietnamese National Assembly. 
  It is rare for so many foreign parliamentary leaders to 
converge on China at a time just before the NPC annual session. 
  Involved in the policy of expanding influence and making 
friends, the NPC Standing Committee has carried out considerable 
contacts and exchanges with its foreign counterparts, which have 
led to its busy diplomacy, said Yin Zuojin, an official of the 
NPC General Office in Charge of Foreign Affairs. 
  In the past year, the standing committee sent out 17 
delegations to visit 27 countries and regions and attend seven 
international conferences, while receiving 37 groups from 
foreign parliaments, including 24 headed by parliamentary 
speakers or chairmen. 
  According to Yin, the number of delegations -- sent out and 
received -- is larger than any previous year. 
  Observers here said that 1993 saw the congress's diplomacy 
with four characteristics. 
  First, as a part of the country's diplomacy, the congress 
paid much attention to strengthening relations with parliaments 
of neighbouring countries. 
  NPC Chairman Qiao Shi's visit last July to the five 
Southeast 
Asian countries marks the first trip there by a Chinese NPC 
chairman. Meanwhile, other senior NPC leaders toured the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea, 
five countries in middle Asia and Japan. 
  Parliamentary leaders from Russia, Japan, Thailand, the 
Philippines, India, the Republic of Korea and other neighbouring 
countries came to China at the same time. 
  Second, the congress exerted more efforts to increase its 
contacts with parliaments of Western countries. 
  In January, 1994, Qiao Shi became the first Chinese NPC 
chairman to make a trip to Germany, Switzerland and Austria. 
Other NPC delegations' visits to Sweden, Norway and Denmark, 
restored China's association with these countries' parliaments. 
  In the past year, the NPC received five delegations from the 
U.S. Congress, more than it did in any previous year. 
  Last year also found the speaker of the European Parliament, 
the delegation of 19 members from nine countries of the European 
Parliament and a delegation of the French National Assembly as 
well as parliament delegations from eastern European countries 
treated as guests in China. 
  Increasing exchanges with parliaments in the Third World 
countries was another feature of the NPC's diplomacy in 1993. 
  The NPC's delegations visited Mexico, Cyprus, Syria, Egypt 
and other Third World countries, including Paraguay, which has 
no formal diplomatic ties with China. 
  The congress was also active in taking part in multilateral 
diplomacy, with several delegations attending various 
international conferences. 
  Yin pointed out that the parliamentary diplomacy not only 
built closer relations between China's national congress and 
foreign parliaments and promoted friendship and cooperation, but 
also provided foreign experiences for China to learn in its 
economic construction and legislation. 
  He expected that with further reform and opening-up, the 
congress's diplomacy will gain even stronger momentum in future.

  [Text] Beijing, February 25 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng said here today that China will adopt a series of laws and 
regulations to protect the legal rights of foreign investors. 
  He made the remark when meeting with John Mike, president of 
the U.S. firm Morgan Stanley, and his party. 
  Li said that with the development of the economy, China's 
requirement in such fields as oil, electricity, transportation 
and communication will be growing, adding that his country 
welcomes foreign businessmen to invest in these infrastructure 
projects . 
  He noted that China will pool more construction funds 
through 
securities markets as well as continuing to make use of capital 
from the international financial institutions, government loans, 
export loans and commercial loans. 
  Morgan Stanley, which was founded in 1935, is one of the 
world's biggest firms managing global securities and investment. 
  During the meeting, Li said that China is willing to set up 
and strengthen relations with strong, world-renowned companies 
which have a good name, hoping that Morgan Stanley will play a 
more important role to this end. 
  China's investment environment is getting better and a 
series 
of laws and regulations will be passed to protect the legal 
rights of foreign investors, he said. 
  John Mike, briefing Li on the management of Morgan Stanley, 
said that his company attaches major importance to the markets 
in China's mainland and Hong Kong. 
  He added that Hong Kong's development depends on China's 
mainland while Hong Kong acts as a bridge of cooperation with 
the Chinese Mainland for Morgan Stanley. 
  He said that Morgan Stanley, with experience in pooling 
funds 
for large construction projects, is willing to contribute to the 
construction of China's Three Gorges project and other 
infrastructure factors. 
  Shi Dazhen, Chinese minister of electricity, and Liu Hongru, 
president of China's State Securities Supervision Committee, 
took part in the meeting.

<F P=106> [By Zhong Yan (6988 1693): "Setting a Fire and Lighting a </F>
Lamp"] 
  [Text] On 9 February, the U.S. CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR 
carried an article entitled "U.S. Exports of Prison Goods." The 
article says: "Just when the Clinton administration continues 
to criticize China for exporting prison goods to the United 
States, California and Oregon are stepping up efforts to export 
their prison-made clothing to Asia." The article specifically 
exposed the following fact: "Oregon will export $3 million 
worth of prison-made jeans and shirts this year to Japan, Italy, 
and other countries," "while California has sent selling offers 
to Japan and Malaysia." 
  The U.S. export of prison-made products is no longer news. 
What merits people's attention is that although the U.S. export 
of prison goods is an open secret, some people in the United 
States do not feel ashamed of it. They continue to castigate 
others on the issue while posing themselves as persons of high 
morals. This cannot help but arouse dissatisfaction from many 
people, including some honest Americans. The article in THE 
CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR precisely represents the sentiments of 
these honest people. 
  Some people in the United States, however, put a label on 
China for the so-called export of prison goods and the alleged 
"violation of human rights." Why, then, does the United States 
not violate human rights by exporting its prison goods? China 
has issued explicit orders and taken practical measures to ban 
exports of such goods, and why has the United States continued 
sending its selling offers to market and export prison goods 
everywhere? These people have made irresponsible criticisms of 
China for compelling prison inmates to work and "produce export 
goods without pay." Perhaps this is the reason why prison goods 
exported by the United States are different from those exported 
by other countries. However, the article in THE CHRISTIAN 
SCIENCE MONITOR points out: "In California prison workshops 
prisoners are forced to work like slaves. If they do not work, 
they are at risk of losing some preferential treatments and 
serving longer sentences." "The U.S. authorities exploit 
prisoners." "The net pay of prison inmates is much lower than 
the official minimum wage. California's prisoners sewing shirts 
receive $0.35 an hour. Although Oregon prisons pay inmates $6 
to $8 an hour, they take back 80 percent as charges of board and 
lodging." 
  There is no wonder that the article quoted some Americans as 
saying: "The U.S. Administration often criticizes other 
countries for infringing upon human rights, but it turns a blind 
eye to the domestic phenomena of human rights violations." Some 
people even said indignantly: "The practice of two different 
kinds of policies on prison goods may smack of old-fashioned 
imperialism." It seems unnecessary to say anything else as the 
foregoing is clear enough, but this writer cannot help thinking 
of an ancient Chinese saying that reads: "The magistrate is 
free to burn down houses while the common people are forbidden 
even to light lamps." This indicates that the magistrate's 
tyranny has developed to such a point that his policies "may" 
not just "smack of" something.

  [Text] Washington, February 24 (XINHUA) -- The Emergency 
Committee for American Trade (ECAT) today urged the U.S. 
Government and Congress to continue to extend the most-favored 
nation (MFN) trade status for China. 
  Kenneth Williams, vice-president of McDonnel Douglas 
Aircraft 
Company (MD), made the statement while testifying on behalf of 
the ECAT at a hearing of the subcommittee on trade of the U.S. 
House Ways and Means Committee beginning this afternoon. 
  He also said that all the 60 ECAT members "strongly support 
the continuation of MFN trade status for China, which is a 
requisite for U.S. participation in the explosive growth in 
China's economy." 
  Williams said that MD and the rest ECAT members are large 
U.S. firms with substantial overseas operations, which are among 
the country's largest exporters and employers. Worldwide annual 
sales of ECAT members are nearly one trillion U.S. dollars and 
ECAT members employ about five million workers, he said. 
  "Increasing numbers of ECAT member companies are 
establishing 
business relations in China. It is a market of huge potential 
and prospective huge benefits for U.S. firms and workers," he 
said. 
  He urged the Clinton administration and the U.S. Congress to 
review the Jackson-Vanik Amendment enacted 20 years ago as part 
of the trade pact of 1974, which links trade with human rights 
in socialist countries. 
  "For several years ECAT has recommended in testimony to 
Congress that the Jackson-Vanik Amendment be reviewed for the 
purpose of either eliminating it altogether or amending it to 
provide authority for long-term extensions of MFN trade status 
for periods of up to five years," he said. "Annual reviews of 
MFN create uncertainty for prospective investors." 
  "Annual debates over MFN for China are increasingly 
contentious and pose serious long-term risks for American 
investors," he stressed. 
  After recalling MD's cooperation with China, Williams said 
that "the withdrawal of MFN for China would fundamentally alter 
the U.S. economic and political position in China. There would 
be very substantial diminution in bilateral trade and in 
existing and future U.S. investments in China." 
  He said American businesses "need the cooperation of our 
government" in meeting and beating global economic challenges." 
  "Denying us the opportunity to play a meaningful role in 
competing for the enormous business opportunities in China will 
very much redound to the disadvantage of the United States," he 
said.
