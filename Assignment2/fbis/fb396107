  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- Compromise proposals were 
presented on Thursday [3 February] at a meeting of leaders of 
the seven coalition parties over a new tax plan proposed by 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to break a deadlock resulting 
from opposition by the largest party in the government, 
coalition sources said. 
  The proposals include nullifying the rate of 7 percent set 
by 
Hosokawa for the tax to be imposed on sales of most goods and 
services, they said. 
  Instead, the Hosokawa administration should set up a 
consultative body to enable the coalition partners to debate a 
new rate for the tax, the sources said. 
  The compromise calls for part of the revenues from the new 
tax to be put into a special account, instead of the general 
account, they said. 
  The new proposals emerged after the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] threatened to withdraw its six 
ministers from the cabinet unless the coalition upheld the 
demand to legislate a provision that would funnel all the 
revenue from the new tax to finance welfare policy measures. 
  Hosokawa had earlier rejected the SDP's demand to insert 
into 
the new tax legislation wording that would obligate the 
government to spend all the revenue form the tax on welfare. 
  On Wednesday, the SDP responded sharply to Hosokawa's plan 
to 
replace the current 3 percent consumption tax with the "national 
welfare tax." 
  Prior to the meeting, SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo and 
his Democratic Socialist Party Counterpart Takashi Yonezawa 
agreed that it is the best way to nullify the new 7 percent tax, 
coalition officials said. Yonezawa conveyed the accord to 
Hosokawa by telephone and urged renewed talks on the tax.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- The ruling coalition parties 
failed to narrow their differences Thursday over a new indirect 
tax plan proposed by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and 
decided to resume discussions on the issue Friday morning. 
  Representatives from the seven coalition parties held tough 
negotiations throughout the day. 
  A compromise emerged during the talks that revenues from the 
"national welfare tax" proposed by Hosokawa be solely spent to 
finance welfare-related expenditures and the rate for the new 
tax be discussed by parties at a consultative body, coalition 
sources said. 
  However, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [SDPJ], which 
threatened to withdraw its six ministers from the cabinet unless 
its demands for amendments to the new tax are met, urged that 
discussions on the issue last two years, while the government 
insisted on one year, the sources said. 
  The Finance Ministry stuck to its demand that the rate for 
the tax be specified in a tax bill, they said. 
  Hosokawa announced early Thursday morning the creation of 
the 
7 percent "national welfare tax" on goods and services, to be 
introduced in April 1997, to finance 6 trillion yen in proposed 
tax cuts in place of the current 3 percent consumption tax.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura indicated Thursday [3 February] the 
government may not announce the long-awaited economic relief 
package within the day as planned. Takemura told a press 
conference, "it may be difficult for the government to decide on 
the contents of the package by the end of the day." 
  The ruling coalition is split over whether or not to 
introduce a new national welfare tax to finance the planned tax 
reduction, the focus of the economic pump-primer reportedly 
worth 15 trillion yen, the largest ever. 
  The Social Democratic Party (SDP), the largest force in the 
coalition, is dead-set against the proposal and has threatened 
to withdraw its officials from the cabinet if the government 
pushes ahead with the plan. 
  Takemura also said the Democratic Socialist Party, another 
component of the coalition, urged Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa to give up the new tax idea and give further debate to 
the issue on how to offset the tax cut. 
  A government source said Hosokawa is unlikely to rethink his 
decision on the proposal. "The prime minister is determined. I 
don't think he will change his mind," said the source.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- The government of Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa faced the possibility of collapse on 
Thursday [3 February] after the largest coalition partner 
threatened to quit the cabinet over his new tax plan. 
  The crisis delayed the announcement of a long-awaited 
economic stimulus package because the new "national welfare tax" 
is designed to finance a planned 6 trillion yen reduction in 
income and residential tax, the focus of the economic 
pump-primer reportedly totaling some 15 trillion yen. 
  Representatives of the seven coalition parties continued 
last- ditch negotiations to try to break the deadlock Thursday 
night. 
  Hosokawa expressed willingness to modify the new tax plan 
following a threat from the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of 
Japan -- SDPJ], the largest force in the coalition, that it 
would withdraw its six cabinet ministers unless Hosokawa drops 
the new tax plan. 
  The premier said the SDP is "important" for the coalition, 
adding, "If the ruling coalition tells me to do something, I am 
not concerned about saving face," according to Akio Nakajima, a 
House of Representatives member of Hosokawa's Japan New Party 
[JNP]. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news 
conference the government is ready to change the details of the 
new indirect tax. 
  The chief cabinet spokesman said the administration is ready 
"to correct the wrong" if it helps to ensure the unity of the 
coalition and alleviate public distaste for the new tax proposal. 
  Hosokawa announced early Thursday without getting consent 
from the SDP that his coalition government has decided to 
introduce the 7 percent "national welfare tax" to finance the 
planned 6 trillion yen tax cut in place of the consumption tax. 
  Hosokawa said the government wants to introduce the new tax 
on goods and services on April 1, 1997. 
  The SDP said the "welfare tax" is nothing more than the 
renaming of the 3 percent consumption tax because its mechanism 
is almost identical to that of the consumption tax. 
  The SDP, which has insisted on the abolition of the 
consumption tax, bolstered its parliamentary strength in a 1989 
House of Councillors election shortly after then Prime Minister 
Noboru Takeshita introduced the tax. 
  In the negotiations the SDP demanded nullifying the rate of 
7 
percent and the timing of implementation of the new tax and 
setting up a consultative body to discuss the tax. 
  But the talks stalled because the Finance Ministry stuck to 
the rate of 7 percent, coalition sources said. 
  Aside from the SDP, opposition to the new tax was voiced by 
the JNP and Sakigake (Harbinger), both coalition partners, at a 
meeting of their legislators. 
  SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo and his Democratic 
Socialist Party counterpart Takashi Yonezawa agreed that it 
would be best to nullify the new 7 percent tax, coalition 
officials said. 
  Yonezawa conveyed the accord to Hosokawa by telephone and 
urged renewed talks on the tax plan. 
  Shinseito, a key party in the coalition, and Komeito took 
the 
leadership in formulating the new tax, and the subsequent row 
has revealed a power struggle within the coalition, political 
analysts said. 
  The political crisis came after the six-month-old fragile 
Hosokawa government overcame another crisis over political 
reform last week. 
  Hosokawa managed last Saturday to hang onto power by 
reaching 
a last-ditch deal over the government's political reform bills 
with the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party. 
  The prime minister told reporters after the passage of the 
bills that he had no intention of raising the consumption tax. 
  Hosokawa scored high public approval ratings following his 
success in enacting the political reform bills in late January. 
  Some political analysts attributed the crisis to his 
arrogance. 
  The SDP has been frustrated after being forced to accept 
compromises over key issues such as the opening of Japan's rice 
market last year and political reform in January since joining 
the seven-party coalition last August. 
  The party said in December that it opposed a GATT compromise 
proposal on partially opening the rice market, but had no choice 
but to abide by Hosokawa's decision to accept the plan. 
  The party was forced to accept a compromise plan on 
political 
reform bills reached between Hosokawa and LDP President Yohei 
Kono for fear that SDP opposition might bring about the collapse 
of the coalition government.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- The Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] said Thursday [3 February] it has 
notified the Secretariat of the House of Councillors of the 
departure of two nonparty members of its parliamentary group. 
  The defection of the two, Hideo Den and Masao Kunihiro, who 
voted against the SDP when an upper house plenary session 
approved the government's package of political reform bills on 
Saturday, reduces the parliamentary group's membership from 73 
to 71. 
  The party has yet to decide how to deal with a group of 
other 
SDP members who rebelled against SDP policy during the vote and 
opposed the package. 
  Also on Thursday, former Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) 
upper 
house member Chinpei Nozue, now an independent, joined another 
parliamentary group composed of governing coalition members of 
the Japan New Party, Shinseito, and the Reform Coalition Party, 
increasing the group's membership from 26 to 27. 
  Nozue's defection leaves the LDP with 95 members in the 
upper 
house.

  [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in 
Japanese at 2311 GMT on 29 January, in its regularly scheduled 
"News 2001" program, carries a 41-minute interview with former 
Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP). The interview is held at an Asahi Television studio in 
Tokyo and moderated by newscasters Yuji Kuroiwa and Kaori 
Matsuyama. Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan (SDPJ), joins the interview through remote 
hookup. The interview is also joined by regular guest 
commentators columnist Kenichi Takemura and Keio University 
Professor Yoshiaki Kobayashi. 
  At 2311 GMT, Kuroiwa asks what Watanabe, who was against 
approval of the political reform bills, thinks of the compromise 
between Prime Minister Hosokawa and LDP President Kono on the 
political reform package. Watanabe says: "They (coalition 
parties) made a compromise and accepted the LDP's proposals with 
minor changes. I think the LDP deserves 90 points out of 100 if 
the single-seat constituency system is eventually approved." He 
admits that he is satisfied with the outcome. 
  On the LDP executives' performances in dealing with the 
political reform bills, Watanabe says LDP President Kono and 
Secretary General Mori have done well. He flatly denies that 
the LDP became weak- kneed at a crucial moment and made a 
compromise with the coalition because of the rumor that the 
public prosecutors office might search offices of some LDP 
lawmakers on 30 January for their possible involvement in a 
series of recent construction scandals. 
  Asked if LDP factions will cease to exist after introduction 
of the single-seat electoral system, Watanabe says: 
"Theoretically, factions will disappear if the single-seat 
electoral system is introduced because there will be no need for 
the LDP members to compete against each other in elections." 
Regarding a rumor that Watanabe may secede from the LDP and 
form a new party, he says that he was just joking when he 
commented on that matter. 
  Pointing out that LDP President Kono have moved closer to 
Prime Minister Hosokawa over the political reform bills, Kuroiwa 
asks what Watanabe thinks of apparent new movement to settle 
various issues through policy cooperation between the LDP and 
the Hosokawa administration. Watanabe explains: "I think this 
is a very good sign. We are not saying no to everything. We 
have been saying that the LDP is a responsible opposition party. 
Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) is playing the central role in 
the coalition government. Komeito and the SDPJ joined the 
coalition of Shinseito, Japan New Party, and Sakigake (Harbinger 
Party). They said that they would maintain the fundamental 
policies that the LDP had kept for 38 years. It is quite fine 
and we can cooperate with them." 
  Saying that the Hosokawa administration's next major task is 
to tackle the issue of raising the consumption tax rate, Kuroiwa 
asks Watanabe if the LDP can cooperate with the Hosokawa 
administration on this matter. Watanabe says: "It is 
impossible to implement policies by ignoring the opposition 
party, which is a major party and has seats close to a majority 
in the Diet. When the LDP had 300 seats, we gave due 
considerations to the intentions of the SDPJ, which had only 
130-140 seats then. Needless to say, considerations should be 
given to the intentions of the LDP, which has seats close to a 
majority. There is no need to fight because they are saying 
that their fundamental policies are the same as ours." 
  At 2330 GMT, Matsuyama asks SDPJ Chairman Murayama, who just 
joined the interview, why his party gave way to the LDP on the 
issue of corporate donations. Murayama says: "The greatest 
goal of the recent political reform was to eliminate corporate 
donations, which are a cause of political corruption. Everybody 
knows that. Therefore, we intensely devoted ourselves to the 
pursuit of getting rid of the root of corruption. It would have 
been nice if our demands were accepted 100 percent. However, 
cooperation and conciliation are needed in politics. Therefore, 
we decided to accept it on condition that we will continue to 
make further efforts to improve it in the future." 
  Saying that the SDPJ -- which was against the introduction 
of 
the electoral system combining single-seat constituencies with 
proportional representation and liberalization of Japan's rice 
market -- gave up many things and made compromises one after 
another after it joined the coalition, Kobayashi asks Murayama 
if the SDPJ will give up its resistance to a consumption tax 
hike as well. Murayama says: "I think it is necessary for us to 
remain in the coalition to exert efforts to make improvements, 
even a step or two, while reflecting our opinions in policy 
matters." Kuroiwa asks: "What is the SDPJ's intention regarding 
remaining in the coalition government even at the risk of giving 
up a fundamental part, which the SDPJ thinks is the most 
important? Murayama explains: "As I said earlier, it is our 
task to exert our efforts while remaining in the coalition to 
respond to the people's expectations by realizing our demands." 
  Kuroiwa asks Murayama to comment on the fact that the 
coalition ultimately had to accept the LDP proposal on corporate 
donations due to the SDPJ rebels, who voted against the 
political reform bills in the upper house. Murayama answers: 
"Originally, those who voted against the political reform bills 
were opposing an introduction of the electoral system combining 
single- seat constituencies with proportional representation. 
They were not talking about the corporate donations alone, but 
saying that it was their fundamental stance not to approve the 
bills. They had their own individual beliefs. I think the 
problem was that they continued to stick to their beliefs. As 
you all know, the SDPJ was originally against the single-seat 
electoral system. After the general election in July, however, 
the SDPJ finally took action and joined the coalition to answer 
to the expectations of the people, who wanted us to change the 
politics. Although we had a heated debate at the party 
convention, we had no other choice but to accept the combination 
of single-seat constituencies with proportional representation. 
Therefore, I was hoping that they would abide by the party 
decision." 
  Asked if the SDPJ executive department will bear the 
responsibility for the recent series of events, Murayama 
responds: "The party will have many chances, such as an 
emergency party convention and central committee meetings, to 
talk about the executive department's responsibility." 
Matsuyama asks if Murayama will resign from the post of SDPJ 
chairman to take responsibility, Murayama says: "No, I am not 
thinking of that." 
  At 2341 GMT, Kurosawa asks Watanabe what he thinks of 
increasing the consumption tax rate. Watanabe explains that the 
government should increase the consumption tax to cover a 
financial shortfall that is inevitable should the income tax be 
reduced. He continues to explain short-term economic merits of 
a decision to increase the consumption tax. 
  As for a positive impact of approving the political reform 
bills, Watanabe says: "It is true that it gave the people a 
sense of relief."

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 2 KYODO -- Payments by the 
government-backed mutual aid funds to farmers to compensate for 
damage by natural disasters hit a record 439.42 billion yen last 
year due to the extremely poor rice harvest, government 
officials said Wednesday [2 February]. The previous record was 
248.39 billion yen in 1980, the officials at the Agriculture, 
Forestry and Fisheries Ministry said. 
  Under the mutual aid system, farmers pay premiums to a 
governmental agricultural insurance body and in case of disaster 
receive insurance money depending on the extent of the damage 
suffered. 
  In 1993, Japan's rice crops were the poorest in the postwar 
period, with the rice crop index remaining at 74, meaning 
extremely poor. The unseasonably cool, wet summer damaged the 
growth of rice plants across the nation. 
  The officials said the ministry has so far paid the money to 
1,366,000 farmers, about half the contracted farmers. Per 
capita payments averaged 321,600 yen, they said. 
  Damage was most severe in Hokkaido, Miyagi and Aomori 
Prefectures, they added. 
  For the payments, the ministry used part of revenue it 
gained 
from sales of imported rice, the officials said. The government 
made a profit by selling imported rice, which is far cheaper 
than the sum the government pays domestic producers, at the 
government sale price for domestic rice to protect Japanese 
farmers.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 2 KYODO -- Prices for domestically 
produced rice are rising sharply in jiyu-mai dealings, or a grey 
market outside government channels, due to growing speculation 
that consumers would prefer to buy domestic rice even at higher 
prices, industry sources said Wednesday [2 February]. 
  Also contributing to the uptrend of rice prices is the fact 
that the pace of importing rice from such countries as China and 
Australia has been slower than initially expected, causing 
concern about the amount of rice available, they said. Rice 
dealers want to build up their stocks of domestic rice 
regardless of the rising prices, they added. 
  In Japan, the government buys about 20 percent of the rice 
crop and oversees the independent distribution of a further 40 
percent. 
  There is also a grey market supported by rice growers and 
distributors outside the government's control. 
  According to the sources, prices for popular domestic rice 
brands on the black market have shot up since the previous week 
by an average of 1,000 yen or more for 60 kilograms. 
  Koshihikari rice, a product of Niigata Prefecture and one of 
the most popular brands, is now sold for about 41,000 yen per 
bag. Akita Komachi of Akita Prefecture is 38,000 yen and 
Sasanishiki of Miyagi Prefecture is 36,000 yen. 
  The inflation in the grey market will inevitably affect 
retail prices of rice, they said. 
  A supermarket in Tokyo's Setagaya Ward is selling 
Koshihikari 
for 11,900 yen per 10 kilograms. 
  "It is selling all right at the price. I suppose consumers 
do not mind paying a little more for tasty rice," a clerk at the 
supermarket said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 2 KYODO -- Japanese rice wholesalers 
will start delivering imported rice to retailers in 
mid-February, mostly without blending the imports with domestic 
rice, industry sources said Wednesday [2 February]. Japan is 
expected to import as much as two million tons of rice, 
including supplies from the United States and Thailand, to make 
up for a shortage resulting from the worst postwar harvest in 
1993. 
  A major rice wholesaler in Yokohama said Thai rice will be 
sold at 300 to 320 yen per kilogram, about half the price of 
domestic rice. Californian rice will sell for about 408 yen per 
kilogram. 
  The government is expected to start delivering Californian 
rice to wholesalers around February 10. 
  Yamatane Corp., a leading rice wholesaler, said it will sell 
imported rice without blending it with domestic rice, giving 
consumers a chance to taste a variety of rice.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 2 KYODO -- Japan's electric power 
industry revealed plans Wednesday [2 February] to upgrade the 
country's boiling water reactors (BWRs) to minimize damage in 
case of a serious accident. The power industry had previously 
maintained that technical modifications for the sake of safety 
were unnecessary because there was very little chance of such an 
accident with Japanese reactors. 
  The containers of all BWRs, the reactor type used in the 
majority of the country's nuclear power plants, will be 
furnished with pressure valves, which, in case of an accident, 
would allow surplus radioactive gas to escape to prevent the 
container from bursting, power industry sources said. Before 
release into the atmosphere, the gas would go through filters 
designed to retain its radioactive components, they said. 
  To prevent damage from a buildup of pressure in pressurized 
water reactors (PWRs), this reactor type will be equipped with a 
device that will burn surplus hydrogen gas originating from the 
reactions in the reactor core. 
  The safety measures, which will cost several hundred million 
yen, will be carried out after being approved by the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry (MITI) and the nuclear safety 
commission, but not earlier than next year, the sources said. 
The power companies will officially submit their upgrading 
proposals to MITI in March. 
  France, Germany and other industrialized countries have 
taken 
similar measures following major nuclear disasters such as the 
near meltdown of a nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island in the 
United States in March 1979, and the Chernobyl disaster in the 
Ukraine, at that time in the Soviet Union, in April 1986. 
  In a 1992 report, the Nuclear Safety Commission, under 
pressure to reassure the public after an accident at Kansai 
Electric Power Co.'s nuclear power plant at Mihama, Fukui 
Prefecture, in February 1991 triggered the reactor's emergency 
core cooling system, urged the Japanese power industry to 
improve reactor safety. After thorough examination of the 
commission report the nuclear power suppliers decided to take 
preventive measures such as improving the coolant capacity of 
reactors to minimize the risk of a serious accident, the sources 
said.

  [Text] The large-scale H-2 rocket, developed solely with 
Japanese technology, was schedued to be launched at 0700 [2200 
GMT] this morning [3 February] at the Tanegashima Space Center 
in Kagoshima Prefecture. But because it was found during 
all-night inspection work that an airduct attached to the rocket 
had developed trouble, the launch was again postponed until 0700 
tomorrow morning. 
  The Tanegashima Space Center, from where the H-2 rocket is 
to 
be launched, had carried on all-night work since yesterday for 
the launch of the rocket at 0700 this morning. However, when 
the doors of the launch pad, where the rocket was installed, 
were opened a little after 2200 [1300 GMT] last night, it was 
found that the airduct attached on the top of the rocket was 
diconnected. Because it takes a long time to reattach the 
airduct to the rocket, the National Space Development Agency 
[NASDA] of Japan decided to postpone the launch until 0700 
tomorrow morning. According to NASDA, the airduct became 
disconnected because of a gust of wind. Because it is expected 
that a soft wind will blow tomorrow, NASDA plans to resume 
preparation work this evening. 
  The launch of the H-2 was initially scheduled for 1 
February, 
but because of bad weather the launch had been postponed until 
today.

<F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 3 February commentary: "We Do Not Utter </F>
Empty Words"] 
  [Text] The process of peacefully resolving the nuclear 
issue on the Korean peninsula is now facing a grave challenge. 
We are at a crossroads as to whether the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula will be resolved peacefully through talks or 
whether it will develop into a factor that aggravates tension. 
This entire situation is fully related to a mean act of 
betrayal by the United States. 
  A DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman released a statement on 31 
January and made clear its position on the current crisis. In 
the statement, we made it clear that if the United States 
overturns its promise to us after all, we will no longer be 
bound to our promise to the United States; that if the United 
States does not intend to hold DPRK-U.S. talks, we have no 
intention of going through all the trouble [kutaeyo] of holding 
talks; and that if the United States intends to choose another 
way, we would choose a countermeasure commensurate with it [kue 
sangunghan taeung pangdo]. This position of ours stems from the 
unshakable will and faith of the Korean people, who consider 
national dignity and sovereignty to be their lives, and defend 
them to the end, and do not yield to any pressure or blackmail. 
  The mean act by the United States of having broken faith 
leads us to make only one choice [uriro hayogum tallinun halsu 
opke mandulgo itta]. In the two rounds of DPRK-U.S. talks, the 
United States promised not to use nuclear forces or any other 
forces or resort to threats to use them. In the 18th contact, 
the United States publicly expressed its intention of 
discontinuing the Team Spirit joint military exercises as part 
of its measure to remove its nuclear threat against us and 
agreed to open the third round of talks and resolve, in a 
package deal, the problematic issues concerning fundamentally 
resolving the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. The United 
States also promised us that inspections would be conducted to 
purely guarantee the continuity of safeguards [sunsu tamboui 
yonsoksong pojangul wihan]. However, shamefully, the United 
States overturned its promise to us. The United States tries to 
conduct the Team Spirit joint military exercise and other 
large-scale nuclear war exercises against our Republic at all 
costs and tries, foolishly, to conduct full-scope inspections 
[chonmyon sachal] tantamount to a return to the treaty [Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty], not inspections to purely guarantee 
the continuity of safeguards. 
  If the United States intends to overturn its promise to us, 
we will no longer be bound by our promise to the United States. 
It is a gangster-like logic that one side may go back on its 
promise and the other side must keep it. We cannot sit back and 
watch the maneuvers of the United States to isolate and stifle 
[korip apsal] us. 
  If the United States sticks to its attitude as today, we 
cannot but reconsider our promises to the United States, such as 
the unilateral suspension of the effectuation of the withdrawal 
from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT], freeze of all 
the nuclear activities, and renunciation of the 
graphite-moderated reactor system. 
  The United States, more than anyone else, will be well 
aware of what the abandonment of such a promise signifies. We 
have never thought, even for a moment, that the DPRK-U.S. talks 
is a gift to us by the United States. We have never wanted 
anything from the United States. Also, we were not ignorant of 
the ulterior motive of the United States. All we hoped was that 
the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula would be resolved 
peacefully in accordance with the expectation of our people and 
the world's peace-loving people. This is why we consistently 
insisted on negotiations with the United States. 
  If the United States does not have the will to resolve the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through talks, then we 
have no intention of going out of our way to hold the talks. We 
are not indebted to the United States at all, and we will 
continue to live without being indebted to the United States. 
  It is a very foolish calculation, if the United States 
thinks 
that we will beg for the talks. Currently, the United States 
even set a time limit and said that it will be inevitable to 
move toward the road of taking sanctions if we do not receive 
the International Atomic Energy Agency's demand to accept a 
full-scope [chonmyon] inspection. The United States is trying 
to frighten someone. The United States is not the only one that 
has measures. The right of choice is not only limited to big 
powers either. We have ways for countermeasures against any 
other option by the United States. 
  What we are saying is not empty talk. We do not like to make 
empty talk. In reality, when the United States and the 
international reactionary forces set about to infringe upon the 
nation's dignity and the country's sovereign right, we answered 
them by announcing to withdraw from the NPT. When the United 
States and the South Korean puppets launched the Team Spirit-93 
joint military exercise, we took a resolute measure by 
announcing a semi-state of war. 
  Our unchanging will is that we do what we say we do. 
Defending to the end the country's sovereign right and the 
nation's dignity is the firm determination of our people and the 
People's Army. We are completely prepared politically, 
ideologically, militarily, and materially to cope with any kind 
of unexpected situation. 
  The United States must not miscalculate our will and 
determination, and must not underestimate our might. If the 
United States comes forward with the attitude of putting 
pressure on us, our attitude for taking a countermeasure will be 
a hundred times stronger, and this will be carried out into 
practical action. 
  It will be good for the United States to have a correct 
understanding of our Republic, our people, and the People's 
Army, and act with discretion. There will only be shameful 
defeat for those who are acting rashly and thoughtlessly.

  [Excerpts] Senior General Than Shwe, chairman of the State 
Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC] and commander in chief 
of the defense services, attended and delivered an address at 
the 1993 third four-monthly coordination meeting between the 
SLORC and state and division law and order restoration councils 
[LORC] which was held this morning at 0900 at the meeting hall 
of the office of the Army commander in chief. [passage omitted] 
  Sr. Gen. Than Shwe noted that this 1993 third four-monthly 
coordination meeting is an important one and it is time to 
review 1993 and to draw plans for the first four months of 1994. 
He expressed the need to review the achievements truthfully 
when presenting reports. Successes and failures should be 
presented realistically. Continuing, he explained that if 
success is not yet realized, new correct methods should be 
implemented to achieve it. If honest presentations are not made 
there will be many errors in the activities and this will hinder 
the progress of the country. 
  He then noted that in this present era there are many 
development works according to the areas and regions. He said 
there are three classifications -- work activities purely on a 
self-help basis, work activities jointly on a self-help basis 
with government support, and government funded activities 
jointly with regional support. He remarked that in implementing 
regional development activities one could not rely on the 
government for everything and they should not be neglected by 
the central organizations also. He then explained since 
regional authorities have been delegated with the power to act, 
they should choose their priorities in implementing development 
projects. Basically, it must be on a self-help basis. If it is 
not feasible, then government support should be acquired. He 
reminded that after taking the responsibilities of the state 
according to historical changes, work should be carried out with 
determination and commitment for the benefit of the country and 
the people. He explained that this opportunity should not be 
utilized for personal gain, but to work with the intent to 
benefit the country. 
  He stressed that after a long time activities tend to become 
routine and responsible personnel need to adopt an active and 
alert motivation to work for the betterment of the state. 
Finally, Than Shwe reminded responsible personnel not to be 
satisfied with the achievements but to work for the better in 
1994 based on past successes and failures. [passage omitted]

  [Text] PHNOM PENH, Feb 3 (AFP) -- Government troops have 
captured a major Khmer Rouge base at Anlung Veng in northwest 
Cambodia, co-premier Hun Sen said Thursday. Hun Sen told AFP by 
phone that government troops were successful in a three-pronged 
attack on the radical faction's headquarters and the logistics 
base for guerrilla operations in north and central Cambodia. Hun 
Sen said ten government soldiers were killed and more than ten 
wounded in the operation, most by mines. 
  "One of the prongs moved very fast and had to wait for the 
other two. But today, the three met together and shook hands in 
Anlung Veng," Hun Sen said. 
  Other government and diplomatic sources, however, said they 
were not sure whether the military had captured the base. But 
Hun Sen said the Khmer Rouge did not put up much resistance, but 
dispersed and escaped. The guerrillas were pushed 15 kilometers 
(10 miles) north of the base and were occasionally firing 
mortars at the government troops, Hun Sen said. 
  A high ranking officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, 
said he thought government troops had occupied part of Anlung 
Veng. "But we are not sure whether Anlung Veng is 100 per cent 
liberated or not," the officer said. A Western diplomat said 
that, while he believed the government was close, he thought the 
troops were moving slowly because of booby traps and mines.

  [Text] MANILA, Feb 3 (AFP) -- Communist assassins have 
threatened to target representatives of the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the Philippine 
government's Energy Regulatory Board (ERB) unless a recent hike 
in oil prices is reversed, newspapers reported here Thursday. 
  The newspapers quoted spokesmen of the Alex Boncayo Brigade 
(ABB), the urban assassination squad of the insurgent New 
People's Army (NPA), that they would target representatives of 
these three groups unless President Fidel Ramos reversed a 22 
percent increase in the prices of fuel products. 
  The formerly-dormant ABB, which killed over 200 soldiers, 
policemen and civilians in Manila from 1987-90, earlier claimed 
responsibility for the bombing of the offices of three oil 
companies in this city on Tuesday. The ABB said the bombings 
were intended to protest the oil price hike imposed last Friday. 
The ABB added that if the government agreed to reverse the oil 
price hike, they in return would agree to open peace talks with 
the government. 
  The Communist Party of the Philippines, the political 
leadership of the NPA, is already considering peace negotiations 
with the Ramos government, but talks have been stalled by 
numerous conditions imposed by the insurgents. 
  Meanwhile, an anti-Ramos newspaper, in an editorial 
published 
Thursday, called on the assassins to target local officials and 
not foreigners. The Today, a broadsheet which began publishing 
just last month, in reaction to the ABB's threat said: "Do we 
have to remind the ABB that native insurgencies are supposed to 
kill native officials, not foreign civilians or diplomatic 
personnel?" The newspaper said that attacking foreigners would 
only scare away foreign investment and would only give the Ramos 
government justification to crack down on civil liberties, "so 
it can steal in peace and stay in power." 
  The newspaper also said that the ABB "doesn't have the 
discrimination and the balls to tackle its proper enemy -- the 
government and its officials." "What a pity. Yet another golden 
opportunity to prove the ABB's usefulness thrown out the 
window," the editorial concluded.

  [Text] Senior officials in the U.S. Government have been 
quoted in media predicting President Clinton is to sign a decree 
putting an end to the 30-year-long economic sanction against 
Vietnam. During a meeting with the U.S. President, political 
leaders have given support for the lifting of the embargo. 
  Meanwhile in Hanoi, American businessmen are hoping the 
embargo will lift soon. Thirty American companies have set up 
representative offices in Hanoi and waiting for permission to 
operate. 
  The spokeswoman of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry Ms. Ho 
The 
Lan said she welcomed the lifting of the embargo against Vietnam 
by U.S. President Clinton on Friday 4th February as rumors said. 
Answering questions by correspondents of Reuter, KYODO, and of 
Australia at the regular press conference in Hanoi on Thursday, 
Ms. Ho The Lan said: The abovesaid event is suitable with the 
reality, aspirations of peoples of the two countries, and the 
world community, and is awaited by public opinions in recent 
days. 
  Ms. Ho The Lan said Vietnam always welcomes all companies 
from the United States as well as from other countries to invest 
in Vietnam on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. She 
said at present, both American and Vietnamese experts were now 
reviewing the results of the 27th joint search of the American 
servicemen missing in action. They are now preparing to return 
the remains to the U.S. side on 7 February. The 28th search 
will be carried out next week in the North, Central, and South 
Vietnam. Vietnam and the U.S. are now arranging for the coming 
meeting between the two countries to settle the property of both 
sides. The meeting will be held in Hanoi on 15-16 February. 
Ms. Ho The Lan pointed out that this would be a necessary step 
on the road to broaden contact towards the normalization of 
relations between the two countries. 
  [Hong Kong AFP in English at 0934 GMT on 3 Feb in a similar 
Hanoi-datelined report adds: "But Vietnamese Foreign Ministry 
spokeswoman Ho The Lan did not welcome a State Department report 
criticizing Vietnam's human rights record, telling a regular 
press briefing that the report was `not objective.' 
  "`I will applaud if President (Bill) Clinton decides to lift 
the embargo,' Lan said. `It will be good not only for Vietnam 
and the United States, but for the whole international 
community.' 
  "`We always welcome companies of the US and other countries 
to invest and do business in Vietnam on the basis of equality 
and mutual benefit,' Lan said. 
  "In another sign of progress toward normal relations, Lan 
said a US-Vietnamese meeting to discuss the restitution of 
assets seized by the two sides at the end of the war had been 
tentatively scheduled for February 15-16 in Hanoi. 
  "`Washington and Hanoi still appear to remain far apart on 
human rights, however, with Lan making clear that Vietnam 
considered the issue its own business. Despite untold 
difficulties, the Vietnamese government has made great efforts 
in better facilitating citizens to better exercise their 
economic, social and cultural rights as well as civil and 
political rights,' she said. 
  "`Against the background of such efforts, the annual report 
by the State Department issued February 1 is not objective.'"]

  [Text] The Australian Government has declared it would 
support United Nations sanctions against North Korea if 
Pyongyang remains intransigent on the nuclear issue. 
Australia's prime minister, Paul Keating, has described the 
matter as of the highest security significance to Australia and 
the region, renewing an appeal to North Korea to cooperate with 
international inspection requirements to nuclear facilities. 
  In the national Parliament in Canberra, Mr. Keating said 
Australia had been most concerned by North Korea's statement 
last Monday threatening to set aside an earlier promise not to 
withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. He said any 
proliferation of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula would 
pose a grave threat to the security of the Asia-Pacific region. 
It would also profoundly complicate Australia's security 
planning and that of other countries in the region, Mr. Keating 
said, adding it also risked the spread of such weapons to other 
presently nonnuclear states: 
  [Begin Keating recording] Australia remains committed to 
dialogue and negotiation to resolve this problem, Mr. Speaker, 
but the international community cannot permit continuing North 
Korean intransigence. If no agreement is reached before the 
meeting of the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] Board 
of Governors later this month, the matter is likely to be 
referred to the United Nations Security Council. It should be 
clear that under those circumstances, Australia would support 
any action imposed by the Security Council, including sanctions.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
remain apart after talks Thursday [3 February] between U.S. 
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii, a senior Japanese official said. 
  "There are some differences," the official told KYODO news 
service, but declined to say whether progress was made. 
  The official described the talks, which stuck to their 
30-minute schedule, as "short and friendly." A finance ministry 
official, briefing reporters, described them as "serious." 
  Kantor called the discussions "interesting" as he left the 
ministry, but declined further comment. 
  The briefer said both sides agreed to instruct their 
negotiators to put more "efforts" into successfully concluding 
the bilateral trade framework talks before a February 11 summit 
between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill 
Clinton. 
  But he said Kantor made no demands for politicians to 
override the Japanese bureaucracy to forge an agreement. The 
briefer said both sides decided not to disclose further details 
of the talks. 
  White house aide Bowman Cutter, who participated in the 
talks 
with Fujii, has publicly called for a decision on the thorny 
trade talks from someone with political responsibility. 
  As Fujii greeted Kantor [words indistinct] early Thursday, 
Kantor responded, "We all welcome this as a step in the right 
direction." The U.S. Government has not had a chance to review 
all the details of the plan, he said, but added that Washington 
expects "continued steps" by Japan to boost domestic demand and 
promote global growth. 
  Fujii said he expects the government will be able to 
formally 
announce its economic stimulus plan Thursday night, 
incorporating the tax plan, which links the cuts with a new 7 
percent "national welfare tax" to replace the current 3 percent 
consumption tax. 
  But the timing of the stimulus package appeared in doubt as 
the governing coalition's biggest member, the Social Democratic 
Party, has threatened to quit the coalition unless the tax plan 
is revised. 
  Socialist officials said the party would decide whether to 
quit the coalition by the end of the day. 
  Fujii laughingly noted to Kantor that the "political weather 
is bad" after Kantor mentioned Thursday's clear weather in Tokyo. 
  Kantor responded that "the political weather is always 
difficult." 
  During their meeting, the two did not discuss the Japanese 
political situation, the ministry briefer said.

<F P=106> [Statement by Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social </F>
Democratic Party of Japan, at a news conference in the Diet -- 
live] 
  [Text] There earlier was a joint meeting of the heads of 
the ruling parties, the Economic Council, and the 
representatives of the five floor groups. At the meeting, the 
prime minister gave an explanation. 
  Following the explanation, I did my best to make it clear 
that the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] cannot agree 
[to what the prime minister said]. The prime minister insisted 
that the SDPJ should cooperate. The budget formulation is the 
responsibility of the cabinet, and the prime minister is in 
charge of it. As such, I told him clearly that while I am not 
referring to the budget formulation per se, I cannot agree to 
the substance of his explanation. Based on that stand, I am now 
announcing a statement by the party. 
  Prime Minister Hosokawa today announced the government's 
basic policy on a tax system reform which will become the basis 
for formulating the 1994 budget. The policy proposes 
instituting, in lieu of the consumption tax, a 7-percent public 
welfare tax in 1997 as a measure to follow 6 trillion yen in tax 
cuts -- including 5.3 trillion yen to be cut from the income tax 
and residential tax. Our party is unable to agree to this. 
  While the tax hike plan is proposed as being the 
introduction 
of a public welfare tax, there is virtually no difference 
between it and the consumption tax. Now that the government is 
being urged to cut taxes as an immediate measure to stimulate 
the economy, it is wrong to attach a much bigger tax increase, 
even if it is imposed three years later. The unpopular effects 
of the consumption tax would not be corrected by the public 
welfare tax. 
  Our party has proposed that a specific tax whose revenues 
would be earmarked for welfare be instituted and further 
discussions be carried out on the tax rate and on when it should 
take effect, but our proposal has not been accepted. It is 
truly regrettable that Prime Minister Hosokawa persisted with 
the Finance Ministry-led tax reform proposal. Our party 
believes that a tax system reform must be premised on the 
assumption that the people agree to it, and it must be one that 
takes a balance of income, assets, and consumption into account 
and that is appropriate for the era of the aged population and 
internationalization. 
  As far as the consumption tax is concerned, in view of the 
history of how the system came to be adopted in the first place 
and of its defects, we have pointed out the need to carry out 
another review of it -- including the possibility of abolishing 
it altogether -- concerning a reform. As for its bearing on the 
income tax cut, the proposal to raise the rate is not a wise 
alternative even when considering the existing poor level of 
consumption. 
  The policy on a tax system reform announced by Prime 
Minister 
Hosokawa does not accept this stand of our party, which is a 
member of the ruling coalition. The process of reaching an 
agreement on it has been very inadequate as well. If Prime 
Minister Hosokawa incorporates the tax hike plan in the budget 
plan to be introduced at the cabinet meeting, SDPJ cabinet 
members will not support it. Moreover, it would become extremely 
difficult for our party to cooperate with the government as a 
coalition member.

<F P=106> [Report on Foreign Ministry spokesman's news conference in </F>
Hanoi on 3 February] 
  [Text] In Hanoi on 3 February, the SRV Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Mrs. Ho The Lan held a regular news conference with 
the participation of a large group of domestic and foreign 
reporters. 
  Regarding the rumor that the U.S. will lift its trade 
embargo 
on Vietnam, Mrs. Ho The Lan said: 
  [Begin Ho The Lan recording] A REUTER correspondent asked: 
Does Vietnam expect the United States to lift the embargo in the 
near future? And does Vietnam want President Clinton to take 
action in line with the 27 January U.S. Senate vote in favor of 
lifting the embargo? Moreover, correspondents from the 
Australian ABC, ITAR-TASS, and KYODO asked about Vietnam's 
reaction to the CBS and CNN reports on 1 February that President 
Clinton has decided to lift the embargo against Vietnam and that 
an official announcement will be made on 4 February. In answer 
to these questions, I would like to repeat that in recent days 
there were many rumors about the United States planning to lift 
the embargo soon. I would like to say that I would welcome 
President Clinton's decision to lift the embargo on Vietnam 
because it is a decision that suits the actual situation and the 
aspirations of the two peoples and the world community, and it 
is a decision that is expected by world public opinion. I also 
received a telophone call from a NEW YORK TIMES correspondent 
asking whether lifting of the U.S. embargo would be good news to 
Vietnam and the United States. I answered that it would be good 
news, because it is not only good news for both Vietnam and the 
United States but for the entire world community, too. The same 
correspondent further asked if, following the lifting of the 
embargo, U.S. companies would be welcomed in Vietnam. I 
answered that Vietnam always welcomes U.S. companies and those 
from other countries to do business and invest in Vietnam on the 
basis of equality and mutual interests. [end recording] 
  At the same news conference, correspondents from AFP, 
REUTER, 
and ITAR-TASS asked about Vietnam's reaction on the U.S. State 
Department report on human rights dated 1 February. The 
Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said that to ensure 
human rights in each nation is the authority and responsibility 
of that country. In Vietnam, although the country is facing 
numerous difficulties, the Vietnamese Government has made great 
efforts to satisfactorily ensure the Vietnamese citizens' rights 
in the economic, social, cultural, civil, and political domains. 
Based on our efforts, I may say that the 1 February U.S. State 
Department report on human rights was not objective enough. 
  Correspondents from ITAR-TASS and the VIETNAM INTERNATIONAL 
RELATIONS journal asked for comments on the news report that 
China and Taiwan are cooperating in exploring areas around the 
Spratly Islands and that Taiwan has planned to build an airport, 
a seaport, and a lighthouse in area of these islands; our 
Foreign Ministry spokesperson said: The Spratly and Paracel 
Islands belong to Vietnam, and as a result, Taiwan's bilateral 
act has violated Vietnam's sovereignty and has further 
complicated the situation in the region.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA Feb. 2 -- It's time to launch a 
nation-wide campaign for practising thrift and fighting public 
property embezzlement, and wastefulness, says Prime Minister Vo 
Van Kiet in a recent interview to VIETNAM NEWS AGENCY. 
  Premier Kiet recalled the Vietnamese people's tradition of 
industry and thrift. He stressed that to practise thrift and 
fight against public property embezzlement and wastefulness have 
become ever more urgent in Vietnam, a poor country which is 
fighting against the danger of lagging behind others in the 
region, and which needs economic accumulation for its own 
industrialization and modernization. 
  The prime minister said he himself and many others worried 
about the situation such as capital construction whose wasteful 
expenditures and losses accounted for at least 10-20 per cent of 
its capital. He called for stepping up the on-going nationwide 
a campaign for practising economy and fight against public 
property embezzlement. 
  He also recalled the government's responsibility in working 
out, and guiding the implementation of policies encouraging 
thrift practice and embezzlement prevention. The authorities at 
all levels should work out concrete and practical plans of 
action for thrift practice and embezzlement prevention in state 
institutions, enterprises and in society as a whole, the prime 
minister stressed.

<F P=106> [Letter of greetings from Minister of National Defense Doan </F>
Khue to the Sao Do Air Force regiment on its 30th anniversary; 
date not given -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Dear comrades: On the occasion of the 30th 
glorious anniversary of the Sao Do [Red Star] Air Force 
regiment, the first jet fighter unit of the Vietnamese People's 
Air Force, on 3 February, I cordially extend my solicitous 
regards and warmest greetings to all personnel of the regiment, 
including cadres, combatants, civilian national defense 
employees, war invalids, sick soldiers, families of fallen 
heroes, retired comrades, and those comrades who have been on 
detached service to civilian sectors. 
  After 30 years of unit building, growth, combat, and 
glorious 
victory led by the glorious Communist Party of Vietnam, 
solicitously cared for by esteemed Uncle Ho and helped and 
assisted by the people, various generations of cadres, 
combatants, and civilian national defense employees of the 
regiment have constantly developed the character and glorious 
tradition of the Vietnam People's Army as well as the tradition 
of the heroic Vietnamese Air Force. They have always remained 
united and singleminded and have resourcefully and bravely 
overcome all difficulties, hardships, and tough ordeals. 
  They are noted for having invented many wise and audacious 
combat tactics and for having defeated the enemy right from the 
first battle, shooting down many of their modern airplanes and 
scoring countless outstanding combat expoits during aerial 
battles, thus contributing duly to the causes of national 
liberation and unification and of building a socialist 
Vietnamese fatherland. 
  In whatever conditions, junctures, and situations the cadres 
and combatants of the regiment have always strived to display 
the lofty qualities of Uncle Ho's soldiers. The regiment 
therefore deserves the title of Heroic Unit of the People's 
Armed Forces and the many other lofty awards given to it by the 
state and the Armed Forces. 
  I would like to avail myself of this opportuniry to commend 
the regiment for the many achievements it has scored over the 
past 30 years. 
  I wish you, comrades, good health and more outstanding 
achievements in the new revolutionary stage so as to eternally 
deserve the trust and love of the party, the people, and the 
Armed Forces. 
  My cordial and determined-to-win salutations.

make every effort to pressure America to maintain its support: 
  [Begin Evans recording] But after the lessons of Somalia and 
the lessons we are still seeing working themselves out in the

States should join the international authority as a whole in 
making a thorough review of how the UN decides and manages

step away from the organization. [end recording]

  [Text] Suva, Feb 3 (AFP) -- Fiji's mercurial prime minister 
Sitiveni Rabuka appears to have reversed his opposition to any 
future political alliance with ethnic Indians, announcing here 
that he now wants to work closely with them. Launching his 
Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT) party campaign in English 
before an audience of about 40 people late Wednesday, he said he 
wanted to promote national unity. Observers said this could mean 
bringing Indians into his cabinet if he emerged the winner in 
the upcoming election. 
  "On the promotion of national unity, we will build on the 
very successful start we have made on inviting the participation 
of the Parliamentary Opposition in the work of the Cabinet 
sub-committee on the review of the constitution," he said. 
  He promised a future Rabuka government would extend this to 
the Agriculture Land and Tenant Act (ALTA) which makes decisions 
about Fijian-owned land leased to predominantly Indian 
canegrowers. 
  One of the demands of the Indian opposition groups is for 
scrapping the racially-based 1990 constitution which gives 
indigenous Fijians a permanent majority of 37 in the 70-seat 
House of Representatives. Rabuka told an SVT political rally 
here Monday that he would not form a coalition with an Indian 
party if the SVT won a majority the Fijian seats. However, he 
reportedly told local reporters Tuesday he would keep the door 
open to alliances with other political parties to keep alive his 
concept of a government of national unity proposed in November 
1992. 
  The ALTA, established in 1966, is a sensitive issue here. 
Fijians want it abolished so they can get their land back when 
leases expires, but Indians favour it because it protects their 
rights to the land. The land issue has become a political 
football because Indian cane farmers do not own their own land 
but have to lease it from indigenous Fijians who own 83 percent 
of the land. Sugar is the backbone of the economy earning about 
260 million Fijian dollars (170 million US) annually in foreign 
exchange. It is exceeded only by tourism which brings in more 
than 328 million Fijian dollars. 
  Rabuka said he would work with the opposition to establish 
parliamentary select committees to look into problems faced by 
the Indians, outlining an eight-point plan which he said a 
Rabuka government would implement. 
  Among other measures, cabinet ministers would not be 
appointed on a provincial basis but on merit, the government 
would proceed with a promised review of valued added tax (VAT). 
  It would also weigh the relative advantages of deregulation 
to consumers of free and open importation with the need to 
protect local producers and manufacturers.

still encountering rough sailing. The government plans to swap 
the microeconomic individual sectors for macroeconomic stimulus 
measures by announcing a package of stimulus measures prior to 
the prime minister's visit to the United States. The U.S. 
Government's pressure on Japan, however, is moving in the 
direction of increasing. ASAHI SHIMBUN has analyzed the future 
of the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks using three 
scenarios. 
<H5>  Failure </H5>
  What most concerns a senior Foreign Ministry official is 
having the working-level negotiations end after failing to 
hammer out any agreement, with this inconclusive finish leaving 
both sides unable to find ways to resume the negotiations at the 
summit talks. 
  The most contentious point in the Japanese-U.S. negotiations 
on individual sectors is setting "objective criteria" to measure 
the openness of the Japanese market. The United States has 
pressed Japan to set targets designed to increase the share of 
foreign goods on the Japanese market to the level of the rest of 
the G-7 industrialized nations. In response, Japan has rejected 
the U.S. demand by saying, "We cannot accept the U.S. demand for 
setting numerical targets." In this way, the two countries have 
been locked in a showdown over the question of setting numerical 
targets. 
  A high-ranking U.S. Government official has attacked 
Japanese 
bureaucrats by saying, "Japanese bureaucrats do not understand 
the Hosokawa government's aims in reform." The same 
high-ranking U.S. Government official also has urged Prime 
Minister Hosokawa to make a political decision. During a 29 
January meeting, however, Prime Minister Hosokawa and Hiroshi 
Kumagai, minister of the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry, confirmed anew the principle that "matters to be 
discussed at the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks should 
be confined to what the government can do using its authority, 
and Japan will not set any numerical targets." 
  If President Clinton sticks to the U.S. demand for setting 
numerical targets against the backdrop of mounting congressional 
pressure on Japan, it is highly possible that the Japanese-U.S. 
economic framework talks will end in failure. An end to the 
Hosokawa-Clinton honeymoon could cast a shadow on the future of 
the Hosokawa government. 
<H5>  Compromise </H5>
  The second case is: An agreement cannot be reached at the 
working-level negotiations on how to handle "objective 
criteria," and the unresolved proposals of both sides are 
included in the agenda of the summit talks. A compromise then 
will have to be formulated "based on the relationship of trust 
between Bill and Mori." They will probably decide on some 
specific "objective criteria," while with regard to the 
interpretation of such criteria, Clinton will say, "even if 
numerical targets are not met, there will not be any sanctions," 
and Hosokawa will use an expression such as "we will make 
efforts so that reforms to open the Japanese market will be 
reflected in the numerical objective criteria," thus reaching an 
accommodation. 
  In that case, the United States can tell its citizens, 
"Japan 
accepted numerical objective criteria," while Japan can explain 
that "we were able to avoid setting numerical targets." 
  Even in this case, however, the deadlocked automobile 
negotiations would be very difficult to resolve. While the 
United States demands that the Japanese automobile industry 
extend its commitment to purchase U.S.-made auto parts under a 
plan covering up to fiscal year 1994, Japan refuses to include 
this in the negotiating agenda, claiming "this should be left to 
a cooperative approach between the private sectors." 
<H5>  Agreement </H5>
  There are also rumors about a "small package" agreement 
covering only issues where agreement can be reached, and 
shelving conflicting points. The new economic framework talks 
will continue up to summer 1995, and during this period, summit 
meetings are to be held every six months. Therefore, it is not 
impossible to set aside some issues for future discussion. 
  This will depend on whether the economic-stimulation 
measures 
to be drawn up this week will receive highly favorable marks 
from the United States. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen has 
pressed the Japanese Government by saying that "income tax cuts 
will have to be of a very considerable scale, and if they 
precede a consumption tax increase for only a short period, then 
this will not be effective." In this regard, it will be 
necessary for Hosokawa to overrule the Finance Ministry's 
"principle of fiscal balance." 
  In this case, numerical targets can be shelved, while on the 
other hand, an action program for government procurement, 
covering not only the present areas under negotiation but also 
extending to the liberalization of the market as a whole, will 
be compiled to win U.S. approval. 
  Which scenario comes to pass depends not only on the 
substance of the upcoming pump-priming measures but also on how 
the United States looks at the future of the Hosokawa 
administration. Because both sides by all means would like to 
avoid a breakdown in the negotiations, it is expected that 
efforts to reach an internal consensus -- and that negotiations 
between Japan and the United States -- will continue up to the 
last minute to achieve, at least, a precarious compromise or a 
small package agreement.

  [Text] It was learned on 1 February that the United States 
plans to accept the "bidirectional" concept in the Japanese-U.S. 
framework trade talks on the issue of insurance market access in 
both nations. The United States apparently has begun to soften 
its position in a bid to break the deadlocked situation as the 
upcoming Japanese-U.S. summit meeting lies just ahead. During 
the vice- ministerial talks held in Washington last week, the 
United States expressed its understanding for holding 
discussions in a bidirectional manner, according to an 
international financial source. Japan and the United States are 
to exchange views on matters they are concerned about. They are 
currently "at a stage where work is being done vigorously to 
determine how to incorporate this (in the reports)" (as stated 
by a senior Finance Ministry official). 
  As for the "bidirectional" idea, it was expressly stated in 
the joint statement announced at the Japanese-U.S. summit 
meeting last July that "consultations will take place under the 
basic principle of a two-way dialogue (between Japan and the 
United States)." However, the United States has so far refused 
to alter its position that the purpose of the framework trade 
talks is to correct the closed nature of Japanese markets, not 
to discuss the problems of the United States. As a result, this 
has stalled the trade talks in general. 
  Meanwhile, the United States has also demanded that 
objective 
criteria be designated to help increase foreign insurance 
companies' share of the Japanese market to the level of that of 
the markets of other major industrialized nations (G-7). Japan, 
however, has refused to change its attitude of a complete 
rejection of this, saying, "Objective criteria could become 
numerical targets" (as stated by a Finance Ministry official). 
Consequently, the talks on insurance issue are expected to 
remain entangled until the final moments before the bilateral 
summit meeting.

  [Text] Honda Motor Co, (Nobuhiko Kawamoto, president) and 
Ovonic Battery Co. (OBC, headquartered in Michigan), a U.S. 
venture company that produces electronic and electrical parts, 
have agreed on the joint development of a next-generation 
battery for electric vehicles [EV] and concluded a development 
contract. This is the first time automobile-related Japanese 
and U.S. corporations have joined hands to develop a 
next-generation battery for electric vehicles. Based on this 
contract, Honda will begin development of a practical battery 
based on the nickel-hydrogen one that OBC has developed. 
Because the nickel-hydrogen battery on which OBC has been 
conducting research and development has over twice the storage 
capacity and durability of conventional batteries, development 
of a low-cost battery is envisioned at the time of its placement 
on board electric vehicles. 
  In addition, because the battery does not include any lead 
or 
cadmium components, it is said to have the merit of being able 
to avoid secondary environmental pollution. The contract 
specifies that OBC will devise the design specs--based on the 
next-generation battery that the company has developed--for 
mounting in the electric vehicles that Honda is currently 
developing, then develop a prototype. Honda will mount the 
battery in its electric vehicles currently under development, 
undertaking to change the specifications for practical use. 
Regarding the contract, Honda, in addition to procuring a 
prototype battery from OBC for research, test production, and 
testing, will pursue technology exchange. Honda is paying OBC 
approximately &yen;150 million for the next-generation battery 
technology. With California--due to the problem of 
environmental protection--introducing regulations by 1998 
mandating that two percent of all vehicles sold there emit no 
exhaust gases, the development of electric vehicles is becoming 
hurried. But the development of high-performance batteries has 
become the major prerequisite for that. Amidst such 
developments, Honda is strengthening its development 
capabilities in environmental-protection vehicles by joining 
hands with a U.S. venture company with strength in a future 
field of technology. OBC, a venture company that excels in new 
materials development and chemical synthesis R&amp;D, is a 
member of 
the Energy Conversion Devices (ECD) group of companies. With 
former General Motors chairman and chief executive officer 
Stempel recently becoming chairman of ECD, the parent company, 
the group is said to be strengthening its capabilities related 
to automobiles.

  [Text] On 2 February, the government confirmed its 
diplomatic itinerary, according to which Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa will visit the PRC on 19-21 March and Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata will visit Russia on 19-20 March. It has started 
working out the details of the planned visits with the 
governments of the respective nations. 
  A while ago, Prime Minister Hosokawa frankly stated that the 
pre-World War II Japanese invasion of Asian countries "was a war 
of aggression." China, which highly acclaimed the prime 
minister's remarks, has requested he visit the country soon. 
However, political uncertainties in Japan have delayed 
coordinating the schedule.

<F P=106> [Interview with Shunji Yanai, director of the newly created </F>
Foreign Policy Bureau of the Foreign Ministry, by unidentified 
GAIKO FORUM correspondent; place and date not given: "Japanese 
Diplomatic Role in Changing Times: On the Occasion of the 
Creation of the Foreign Policy Bureau"] 
  [Text]Experience and Reflection of Gulf Crisis Are in 
Background 
  [GAIKO FORUM] Would you tell us from the beginning how the 
Foreign Policy Bureau came about. 
  [Yanai] When the Cold War ended, the international situation 
became fluid and complicated. Japan was confronted with the 
question of how to maintain its security, stability, and 
prosperity as well as the task of building a post-Cold War new 
international order; hence the need to create an organization in 
the Foreign Ministry which could properly respond to such 
situations. During the Cold War, one diplomatic policy was to 
belong to either the East or West camp. But a new world order 
has not yet been formed in place of the Cold War, and it demands 
Japan deal with the new era in a positive manner. 
  In the report of the third Council for Administrative 
Reform, 
an opinion was expressed that the Foreign Ministry needs to have 
an organization which can deal with such situations. In 
response, the Consultation Group for Consolidated Diplomacy was 
formed with Ryuzo Segawa as its chairman. More concrete views 
on reorganizing the ministry were exchanged at the meeting, and 
a report was compiled in December 1991. The report recommended 
the ministry create two bureaus -- a consolidated policies 
bureau and an international information bureau, although names 
were not specified. 
  In the background were such concrete realities as the 
experience and reflections of the Persian Gulf crisis which took 
place in August 1990. In the sense that the war erupted in the 
Persian Gulf, the Middle East and African Affairs Bureau was in 
charge of the affair, but the initial diplomatic efforts to deal 
with the situation were made at the United Nations and the 
Security Council. In the meantime, the coalition forces were 
organized with the United States as its main component, joined 
by the United Kingdom, France, and other countries. The Middle 
East and African Affairs Bureau alone could not handle such a 
situation. The matter of transporting refugees of Asian origin 
was related to the Asian Affairs Bureau. When situations arose 
in which periphery countries were seriously affected by the war 
and needed assistance, the Economic Cooperation Bureau had to 
step in. 
  Therefore, crisis management was required for wider spheres 
and more subjects than in the past, and this could not be 
properly handled by the existing organizations. It was keenly 
felt that an overall organization such as the Foreign Policy 
Bureau was necessary. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] As a matter of fact, the United Nations Bureau 
was reorganized, was it not? 
  [Yanai] Most functions of the United Nations Bureau were 
taken over, and the Policy Planning Division of the Information 
Analysis, Research, and Planning Bureau was added. In addition, 
the General Affairs Section was newly created in the Foreign 
Policy Bureau. Simply speaking, the United Nations Bureau was 
dissolved for a better setup with additional functions. By 
nature, the United Nations deals with everything in the 
universe. In that sense, the United Nations and what the 
Foreign Policy Bureau plans to contend with are closely related. 
Therefore, the bureau took over such functions. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] Were there rearrangements with other bureaus? 
  [Yanai] There were some, but they were not limited to mere 
adjustments. The new bureau is in charge of planning and 
framing foreign policies which are across-the-board, 
comprehensive, and long-range in nature. In the past, no 
bureaus existed to handle such matters. 
  Adjustments with other bureaus were then needed to deal with 
various problems in a more concrete manner. This did not mean 
replacing other bureaus, but working out an overall policy by 
coordinating the matters under other bureaus' jurisdiction. 
<H5>  Comprehensively Coordinating Multinational Matters </H5>
  [GAIKO FORUM] Matters which cannot be solved by one nation, 
such as problems of displaced persons and human rights, have 
taken place in record numbers in recent days, have they not? 
  [Yanai] The Global Issues Division is in charge of matters 
on a global scale. As a whole, the bureau consists of nine 
divisions [ka] and five sections [shitsu].

  The deputy director-general of the bureau is a councilor, 
and 
the councilor of the Arms Control and Scientific Affairs 
Department as well as the director of the International 
Cooperation Department have counselors under them. Basically, 
the organization of the Arms Control and Scientific Affairs 
Department and the International Cooperation Department are 
headed by persons with director-general's rank. Therefore, you 
may construe they are almost independent organizations even 
though they fall within the Foreign Policy Bureau. These days 
there are matters which cannot be solved by a nation, and many 
things which are beyond the abilities of a superpower such as 
the United States. The organization was formed with this in 
mind. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] In order to practically strengthen foreign 
policy, coordination with the cabinet and Foreign Ministry, or 
with other ministries or civilian needs, is necessary. What do 
you think about this? 
  [Yanai] The cabinet is in charge of ironing out differences 
of opinion between the ministries and coming up with a 
conclusion as a whole. But in the process of drawing up and 
working out foreign policy, it is naturally required to 
coordinate and cooperate with other government agencies and 
private organizations, including the mass media and the Diet. 
Such work is not monopolized on by my bureau, for other bureaus 
do the same work as well. For domestic coordination and 
negotiations with foreign countries, it is convenient in many 
ways for the Foreign Ministry as a whole to have a general 
policy. That point is different from past practices. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] Your bureau practically came into being with 
the inauguration of the Hosokawa cabinet. Did you make 
preparations for the Japan-U.S. talks between Prime Minister 
Hosokawa and President Clinton? 
  [Yanai] Japan-U.S. relations are handled by the North 
American Affairs Bureau. The Japan-U.S. talks took place in 
September of 1993 when the prime minister attended the United 
Nations General Assembly. My bureau was directly involved in 
the preparations for the prime minister's attendance at the UN 
General Assembly and in working out the contents of his speech. 
Not confined just to Japan-U.S. relations -- for example, 
President Yeltsin's visit to Japan -- direct bilateral 
negotiations are handled by either the North American Affairs 
Bureau or the European and Oceanic Affairs Bureau. But in such 
bilateral talks, there arises matters of global scale as well as 
multinational matters. My bureau will be involved in such 
matters in order to coordinate them comprehensively. 
<H3>  On Japan's Becoming a Permanent Member of the Security 
Council </H3>
  [GAIKO FORUM] Newspaper reports had it that the cabinet and 
Foreign Ministry maintained opposing views on Japan's becoming a 
permanent member of the UN Security Council. 
  [Yanai] Delivering an address at the UN General Assembly was 
the first opportunity for the Hosokawa cabinet to manifest its 
foreign policy. Domestically, there was an address at the Diet 
as well as news conferences, but externally that was the first 
official speech. 
  The most essential problem in the making of an organization 
for the new world is how to reorganize the Security Council. In 
his address, the prime minister touched on this. As a matter of 
fact, the Japanese view was made public in a proposal to the 
United Nations secretary-general in early July near the end of 
the Miyazawa cabinet. Since the basic foreign policy of the 
Hosokawa cabinet was to succeed the former cabinet's, 
fundamentally there were no problems. 
  Since it was an address designed for the General Assembly, 
the expression sounded naturally different from the proposal. 
Frankly speaking, it is only natural that the nuance become 
different to reflect various opinions in the coalition. In that 
sense, it cannot be denied there were controversies in the 
process of drafting the manuscript for the General Assembly. 
The mass media exaggerated it to sound as if there were basic 
changes in their way of thinking, but I do not agree with that. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] It was reported the Foreign Ministry 
positively favored Japan's becoming a permanent member, and that 
Prime Minister Hosokawa was reluctant to be so hasty. 
  [Yanai] I do not understand the intention of that kind of 
report. It is an important problem, but the nation as a whole 
does not correctly comprehend the advantages or responsibilities 
once Japan becomes a permanent member of the Security Council. 
In that sense, I am of the opinion the matter should be 
thoroughly debated domestically. 
  Internationally, the reorganization of the Security Council 
has become a potential reality in a hurry. In the process, 
international opinion is conspicuously gaining force that Japan 
and Germany should be made permanent members. More than 20 
nations are in favor of the idea. A great number of countries 
which have not made their views public are wishing Japan and 
Germany would contribute by becoming permanent members in view 
of their present power status in the world. However, 
representatives of developing nations have to be considered for 
the position if Japan and Germany are to be members. Such 
adjustments require time. 
  There is a consensus that several new nations should be 
added 
to the permanent membership, and that the permanent membership 
itself should be expanded. While there is the need to 
thoroughly discuss the matter domestically, there are risks in 
being left behind internationally if Japan indulges in domestic 
discussion because international movements are gaining speed. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] With reference to the dispatch of the Japanese 
Self-Defense Forces to foreign countries in relation to 
peacekeeping operations [PKO], there seems to be apprehension 
about Japan becoming a permanent member because it may 
contribute to increased military burdens. What is your opinion? 
  [Yanai] There are no United Nations forces as such provided 
for in the UN Charter, and becoming a permanent member does not 
immediately cause a nation to make its armed forces available. 
As for present permanent member nations, they bear the 
responsibility of providing troops or other facilities to the 
United Nations only after they work out special agreements with 
the UN. So long as there are no commitments, no differences 
exist among permanent or nonpermanent member nations of the 
Security Council and ordinary UN member nations. 
  Japan's Constitution has no provisions for the PKO. Member 
nations have discretion as to whether they participate, using 
their own judgment. A permanent member nation has no obligation 
to participate. Until recently it was the rule that the five 
major powers -- all permanent members -- did not participate in 
the PKO. It was only in recent days that they began to 
participate. 
  As another example, let me cite the coalition forces 
during the Gulf war. At the time, use of force was authorized 
by a UN Security Council resolution which Russia [then the 
Soviet Union] supported, with China abstaining. Although their 
standpoints were different, the Soviet Union and China did not 
send troops. Therefore, in compliance with the UN Charter, an 
obligation to provide military cooperation does not come about 
based merely on grounds of a nation being a permanent member of 
the Security Council. 
  Since all problems of international importance related to 
peace and security are debated at the Security Council, 
overwhelmingly voluminous information can be gathered. Being 
present at all times will be advantageous for Japan which seeks 
the right to speak on such matters as promoting peace and 
disarmament. 
  Another point I have to make is that Japan is the second 
largest contributing nation to the upkeep of the UN, only after 
the United States. Furthermore, Japan is paying its share on 
time in comparison to the United States which has a major amount 
in arrears. Thus, Japan is the best financial contributor. In 
view of the democratic principle of "no taxation without 
representation," it is a problem for Japan to pay for decisions 
made without Japan's participation. 
<H5>  Task of Positively Working for Peace </H5>
  [GAIKO FORUM] What sort of diplomatic tasks do you have in 
mind for Japan to deal with in the future? 
  [Yanai] Maintaining peace is a vital problem, although it is 
difficult to decide what problems should be given priority. 
After World War II, Japan enjoyed peace, even though there was 
no guarantee it would last forever. Pacifism thus has taken 
root. Japan would never engage in aggression nor become a 
military power. However, I do not think a majority of Japanese 
have ever thought of such pacifism when Japan actively 
contributed to creating organizations or engaged in activities 
to ensure world peace. But the Persian Gulf crisis was 
instrumental in initiating earnest talks about such matters and 
in creating in the Japanese such a consciousness. Therefore, 
Japan's major task is to make positive efforts for the cause of 
peace. Then there are problems of freedom, democracy, and human 
rights which are not heeded in many countries of the world, thus 
destroying peace. In addition, there are problems of poverty 
and maintaining standards of living, which could be defined as 
the foundation or infrastructure of peace. Fortunately, Japan 
has the strength to contribute to many countries in such fields, 
creating such foundations of peace as human rights, humanity, or 
economic development. Japan has made considerable contributions 
so far in economic cooperation, and such contributions will 
continue to be necessary in the future. 
  There is still the long-range problem of the environment. It 
is further deteriorating toward the end of this century, and 
Japan has to make more contributions since it has the ability to 
do so. In close relation with the problem of peace, Japan has 
to make parallel efforts in dealing with such problems as 
disarmament and nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
These are major subjects to be dealt with. 
<H5>  Methods of Propelling Asia-Pacific Cooperation </H5>
  [GAIKO FORUM] In retrospect as regards Japanese diplomacy, 
the problems of the Meiji era were said to be amendments to 
unequal treaties and problems related to the Korean peninsula. 
Presently, although the Soviet Union has collapsed, the 
existence of Russia poses great concern for Japan. Some 
American journalists are said to have predicted Japan's going 
nuclear once North Korea [DPRK] possessed nuclear arms. There 
are also many things to be apprehensive about as regards 
post-Deng Xiaoping China. In brief, East Asia -- which is 
closely related to Japan -- seems to be an unpredictable area. 
  [Yanai] As you said, security and peace in Northeast Asia 
has been one of the most vital aspects for present as well as 
past Japanese diplomacy. 
  After the Soviet Union collapsed, a considerably large 
portion of it was inherited by Russia, and Russia itself has 
created many unstable factors during its process of change. Of 
course, it has not gone back to the times of czars; rather, it 
is making efforts to become a democracy and a market economy. 
For the sake of stability in that region, Russia wished to make 
headway in that direction by all means, and Japan is determined 
to assist in any way it can. At the same time, Japan will 
attempt to settle territorial disputes revolving around the 
so-called northern territories in order to expand equilibrium. 
  China has been pursuing reform and modernization, and seems 
to have achieved considerable success in improving its economy. 
It is most desirable for regional stability that China becomes 
more open and modernized; Japan may be able to assist in that 
direction. 
  The Japan-ROK relationship has greatly improved, but it 
deserves more in view of our grueling historical past. The 
North Korean regime and its economy is isolated and closed to 
the outside world; it should be made a member of the 
international community so the security of this area can be 
greatly enhanced. Presently North Korea is suspected of 
developing nuclear weapons; that question should be solved by 
all means so that North Korea can become an ordinary member of 
northeast Asia. It necessary to do everything possible in order 
to attain that goal. 
  Unlike in Europe, there is little regional cooperation in 
this area, much to our regret. It is true Europe worked a 
considerably long time to achieve what it has today. Asian 
nations need time to cooperate with other nations in the 
Asia-Pacific region in a broad sense, and to establish 
cooperative relations in East Asia or Northeast Asia in a 
narrower sense. This is considered one of the tasks of the 
Foreign Policy Bureau. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] Asia seems to have antipathy against the human 
rights diplomacy of the United States, harboring the concept 
that a dictatorship is tolerable for the sake of development. 
Is it not Japan's vital role to act as go-between for the human 
rights ideology of the United States and the realities of 
developing nations? 
  [Yanai] Attitudes in Asia about human rights certainly 
differ from those of the United States and Europe, nor are they 
the same between the United States and Europe. It is important 
to respect basic human rights, of course; peace cannot be 
maintained without it. On the other hand, it is self-evident 
that human rights problems in places where overcoming poverty is 
the burning question are different from those in countries 
enjoying a relatively high standard of living. 
  Therefore, as regards world standards of respecting human 
rights, there is naturally a limit to which a country can 
intervene by praising or condemning another country's human 
rights record based on its own standards. It is better to a 
certain degree to deal realistically with the problem of human 
rights in order not to come into conflict with the sovereignty 
of those countries in question. Asia covers a broad area, and to 
a certain degree the way of thinking in some Asian countries is 
comparatively moderate with respect to human rights. 
<H5>  Necessity of Sharing International Information </H5>
  [GAIKO FORUM] Today diplomacy and internal affairs are 
closely related and inseparable as in no other time in the past. 
Have you anything to add in relation to domestic society? 
  [Yanai] In the past, diplomacy found points of contact with 
domestic affairs in relation to war and peace, and in rare cases 
with trade. Economic and social affairs between Japan and 
foreign countries allowed them to have contacts. Contrarily, 
today almost every element of both domestic and foreign 
communities is interrelated. For that reason, it is necessary 
to coordinate with internal affairs in order to execute good 
diplomacy. Diplomacy will never succeed without the support of 
the people. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] Other government agencies are closely related 
to private enterprise or regional communities because they have 
the right to authorization or licenses. However, it is pointed 
out that the Foreign Ministry does not have such a domestic 
foothold. Do you have any countermeasures? 
  [Yanai] Domestic information is not automatically gathered, 
and problems related to internal affairs are not easy to 
understand. In order to gather and absorb domestic information 
or demands, efforts are necessary to contact other government 
agencies, politicians, the mass media, and private enterprises 
within the country. The Foreign Ministry has networks in 
foreign countries which provide access to local feelings. But 
these feelings are not necessarily understood at home. Therein 
lies the difficulty, and it is necessary to make available 
domestically the information gathered abroad, and not keep it in 
the ministry. It has become more and more necessary to gather 
information rapidly and correctly, and to share it with others. 
  So far I have talked mainly about the Foreign Policy Bureau 
in relation to the recent reorganization of the Foreign 
Ministry. But the International Information Bureau was created 
at the same time. This means functions not related to 
information are transferred to the Foreign Policy Bureau, and 
the International Information Bureau is to exert more effort in 
gathering and analyzing information. Organizational changes were 
made simultaneously in order to make the information gathered 
available domestically. 
  One of the tasks of the Foreign Policy Bureau is to become 
the center of crisis management in the event of large-scale 
emergencies. The Foreign Policy Bureau has the General Affairs 
Division as part of its main body; this division will become the 
center of the entire Foreign Ministry and will deal with large 
emergencies such as the Persian Gulf war. In the past, such 
functions did not exist. When emergencies arose, task forces 
were quickly formed, but they were not permanent. Now that the 
General Affairs Division exists under the Foreign Policy Bureau, 
emergencies will be dealt with at all times. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] Thank you very much.

Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission: "With 
Inspections, To Watch With Impartial Stance and Handle 
Infractions Resolutely; Year's Activities of Securities and 
Exchange Surveillance Commission"] 
  [Text] More than a year has passed since the 
Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission was established 
on 20 July 1992. Ever since, the surveillance commission has 
worked to get itself set up in various respects, such as firming 
up the organization and in-service training for its staff, 
endeavoring to put its operations into effect quickly and 
concretely, and so far, it has conducted its assigned duties in 
a generally orderly manner. The surveillance commission is 
required by law to report publicly its business affairs. 
Responding to that on last 15 October, it pulled together the 
situation of its activities to date and published it as 
"Activities and Other Affairs of the Securities and Exchange 
Surveillance Commission." In the following, I wish to report on 
the year's activities since the surveillance commission started 
out, based on the contents of the report. 
<H5>  Report's Significance </H5>
  Under laws establishing the Ministry of Finance, the 
surveillance commission "must annually publish the situation of 
its business affairs." 
  Amidst the soul-searching on the so-called security scandals 
of 1991 and the study of countermeasures to that, the 
surveillance commission was set up as part of the measures to 
review the inspection and surveillance setup. For the 
securities market and other institutions to discharge their 
functions smoothly, it is essential that investor trust be 
sustained that fairness of trading in the market is guaranteed 
and that the market is fair. In that sense, if the surveillance 
commission--having ensured fairness in securities trading and so 
on--handles its functions properly and lets such activity be 
widely known, it can contribute much to upholding investor trust 
in market fairness. From such a viewpoint, reporting on the 
activities of the surveillance commission is considered 
obligatory; and, giving consideration to the objectives of the 
laws, we have concretely considered the substance and 
methodology of the report. 
<H5>  Report Methodology </H5>
  The report of the surveillance commission pulls together 
business affairs that the surveillance commission handled during 
the year and in its contents considers a fair amount of the 
things it had to do. It was prepared in the form of a pamphlet 
and mailed to those concerned so that it might also be offered 
for perusal at outlets of the surveillance commission, financial 
authorities, and institutions with voluntary controls. Also, a 
summary of the report was carried in the official gazette. 
  We thought that putting out the report in this manner would 
make it possible to have a wide sector of the public know about 
the surveillance commission's activities. 
<H5>  Gist of Report </H5>
  In the "Activities and Other Affairs of the Securities and 
Exchange Surveillance Commission" pulled together this time we 
covered activities which the surveillance commission engaged in 
from 20 July 1992, when it was set up, through 30 June 1993. The 
"Activities and Other Affairs of the Securities and Exchange 
Surveillance Commission" consists of an introduction and main 
text. The introduction describes the details of setting up the 
surveillance commission, its organization, and a summary of the 
surveillance commission's business, while the main text 
separately describes the chief duties of the surveillance 
commission: Chapter 1. "Inspections"; Chapter 2. "Examinations"; 
Chapter 3. "Investigating Infractions"; Chapter 4. "Advisories"; 
Chapter 5. "Inspections of Financial Institutions by Minister of 
Finance"; Chapter 6. "Institutions With Voluntary Controls"; and 
Chapter 7. "Other Activities." 
  Based on the report's contents, the following sets forth the 
surveillance commission's activities for the year. 
<H5>  Inspections </H5>
  1. Based on the inspection authority granted by the minister 
of finance, the surveillance commission conducts on-site 
inspections of securities firms and other financial institutions 
with permits for security business from the standpoint of 
ensuring fairness in things like securities trading. 
  2. For conducting inspections, the surveillance commission 
laid down a basic inspection policy and basic inspection plan in 
August 1992 for the 1992 business year (July 1992 through June 
1993). 
  In this basic inspection plan for conducting inspections of 
securities firms, et al., we set out to conduct accurate 
inspections using the following points of emphasis: 
  a) Many-sided checking on observance of the various market 
rules from the standpoint of ensuring fairness in securities 
dealing. 
  b) From the standpoint of sustaining a healthy managerial 
posture by securities firms and others, fully checking on such 
aspects of their business posture as the facts on their 
encouraging investments. 
  c) From the standpoint of ensuring reliability in the 
securities business, reviewing and getting a grasp of the 
circumstances of the internal management setup so as to fully 
check on whether it is functioning effectively. 
  3. In the 1992 business year for inspections, the 
surveillance commission and financial authorities undertook 84 
inspections of securities firms and 11 inspections of financial 
institutions with permits for handling securities business. 
  Of the inspections begun in this period, inspection findings 
had been delivered by 30 June 1993 to inspected institutions and 
inspections completed on 49 securities firms and seven financial 
institutions with permits to conduct securities business. 
  4. To consolidate the results of inspecting securities 
firms, 
et al., according to the points of inspection emphasis: a) As to 
their observance of trading rules, we found such problems as 
inducements promising to provide special profits (so-called 
"stock shuffling" [tobashi]), entrusting improper trading deals 
in transferred company debentures and entrusting transaction 
cleanup deals; b) as to their business posture, we found the 
problems of placing excessive trust in clients and excessive 
switched sales of investment trusts; and c) in their internal 
managerial setups we found such things as corruption and client 
disputes, leaking reports of corruption cases, and taking and 
transferring orders with persons other than clients. 
  As for findings of major regulatory infractions as a result 
of inspections, as stated below we sent advisories to the 
minister of finance, contacted administrative authorities about 
problems found in the inspections, and had instructions for 
improvements sent from the said authorities to the parties 
inspected. 
<H5>  Examination of Transactions </H5>
  1. As for examining transactions, based on authority granted 
by the minister of finance under securities trading laws to 
collect reports and data, we do daily market observations by 
collecting reports and data from securities firms and financial 
institutions with permits to conduct securities business. 
  2. In the period for this report, a total of 170 
examinations 
were conducted. Breaking these down by content, 154 examined 
price structure, 12 examined insider trading, and four examined 
other areas. 
  3. As to characteristics of the cases that were subjects of 
examinations, due to the fact that, compared to earlier periods, 
the activities of so-called "speculators" in buying up stocks in 
volume have subsided amid the general stagnation of the 
securities market, large and long-term cases were few and small 
cases became more numerous. 
  As for the work of transaction examinations, although we 
found that in many cases there was no problem, the examination 
activity itself is functioning as a direct and indirect 
deterrent to the kinds of transactions that become problems. 
<H5>  Investigating Infractions </H5>
  1. When it was necessary for the surveillance commission 
staff to investigate infractions injurious to fairness in 
dealing, they can do discretionary investigations by conducting 
interrogations, inspections, custodial detainment, etc., as 
well as mandatory investigations by spot inspections, searches, 
and seizures under warrants issued by a judge. 
  The surveillance commission receives reports of 
investigation 
findings from its staff and, when it gets proof of an 
infraction, issues an indictment. 
  The authority to investigate infractions is a newly created 
power attendant to the surveillance commission's creation. By 
bringing to light the truth about pernicious acts injurious to 
fairness in dealing and by seeking criminal prosecution from 
indictments, we hope it will play a major role in securing 
fairness and health in the market. 
  2. In the period of this report, because of suspicions of 
market manipulation of Tokyo Stock Exchange First Section listed 
stock, in December 1992 the homes and offices of those suspected 
of infractions were raided, searched,items seized in an enforced 
investigation, and the needed investigation was conducted. 
  3. As a result of such investigation, on 21 May 1993, given 
the fact of market manipulations by the two persons suspected 
of the infractions, they were indicted by the Tokyo District 
Public Prosecutor's Office for violating the securities trading 
law. 
  (Note: With the surveillance commission's indictment, an 
arraignment was effected 16 August by the Tokyo District 
Prosecutor's Office against the two suspected of an infraction.) 
<H5>  Advisories </H5>
  1. When it has conducted inspections or investigations of 
infractions and found it necessary, the surveillance commission 
can advise the minister of finance, based on its findings, on 
administrative punishment or other measures that should be taken 
to ensure fairness in securities trading, etc. 
  2. In the period of this report, it provided the minister of 
finance with the two following advisories on the outcome of its 
inspections. Receiving these, the minister of finance effected 
specific punishments. 
  a) With securities firm A, a violation having been found of 
the regulations (inviting investments by promising to provide 
special profits and entrusting improper dealing) by officers and 
staff of the securities firm, an advisory was issued to seek 
administrative punishment and other appropriate measures. 
  Based on this advisory, the minister of finance applied such 
punishment as suspending the business of the involved section of 
the securities firm. Also, receiving notification from the 
Ministry of Finance, the Japan Association of Securities Dealers 
levied the punishment of canceling its canvasser's registration. 
  b) With securities firm B, an infraction of relevant 
regulations by an employee (concluding a contract for entrusting 
a transaction cleanup deal) having been found, we issued an 
advisory requesting suitable measures. 
  Based on the advisory and having received notification from 
the minister of finance, the Japan Association of Securities 
Dealers carried out the punishment of suspending the work of the 
canvasser. 
<H5>  Inspections of Financial Institutions by Minister of Finance </H5>
  1. For basic items relating to the inspections it conducts 
of 
financial institutions, the minister of finance must heed the 
views of the surveillance commission and must report to the 
surveillance commission each quarter on the status of 
inspections under way. 
  Furthermore, for inspections of financial institutions 
conducted by the minister of finance, the surveillance 
commission can make recommendations; but during the 1992 
inspection year, it found no situations for which 
recommendations were deemed necessary. 
  2. As to the inspections the minister of finance conducts, 
the surveillance commission stated its opinion in August 1992 
that, "based on current financial conditions, in inspecting 
financial institutions, we should seek to understand precisely 
the details of their assets, grasp the status of each financial 
institution's rethinking of its internal office management, 
etc., and by checking on whether that is functioning 
effectively, should seek to conduct effective inspections in 
carrying out our inspections. 
  3. According to a report from the minister of finance, in 
the 
1992 inspection year it initiated 249 inspections of financial 
institutions, 54 inspections of foreign exchange institutions, 
and 191 inspections of securities firms. Of these, as of 30 June 
1993, it had completed the inspections of and sent instructions 
to 158 inspected financial institutions, 32 inspected foreign 
exchange institutions, and 134 inspected securities firms. 
<H5>  Other Matters </H5>
  Besides what has been stated above, in this report we 
describe in detail the activities of such voluntary control 
institutions as the Securities Dealers Association and 
securities exchanges. Also, concerning the activities of the 
surveillance commission, it touches upon 1) the fact that, 
within the period of this report, the surveillance commission 
did not find conditions on which it should make recommendations 
on policies the Minister of Finance should adopt; 2) information 
received from all sources during the period of this report came 
to 497 items; and 3) to build links with authorities regulating 
securities in other countries, we are applying for membership in 
the International Organization of Securities Control Officers 
(abbreviated IOSCO). 
  (Note: At the committee meeting of IOSCO representatives in 
Mexico City on 25 October, the surveillance commission was 
formally admitted.) 
  As indicated, we believe the surveillance commission has so 
far faithfully carried out its expected role. Henceforth, in 
doing inspections and other work we will be watching 
transactions on the securities markets in accordance with laws 
and regulations and with an impartial stance, while following a 
course of resolutely dealing with infractions. 
  As for the surveillance commission, we will be pleased if 
through such activities we can ensure fairness and transparency 
of the market and contribute to the healthful manifestation of 
its functioning.

  [Text] The main points of the ruling coalition parties' 
proposal package for an outline of the tax system revision for 
fiscal 1994 were revealed on 30 January. Among the main points 
are: 1) To study a reduction of land value tax on land for 
public use; 2) to postpone a plan to ease conditions for a 
special tax break for selling one's residential property to buy 
a more expensive one; and 3) to postpone implementation of an 
increase in liquor and tobacco taxes. Moreover, the package 
includes plans to maintain special corporate tax and to change 
delayed payment of inheritance tax into payment in kind. The 
ruling parties are scheduled to reach a conclusion on income tax 
reduction and revenue sources for the reduction, at their 
representative meeting. Subsequently, in combining the 
currently-revealed package with the conclusion on income tax 
cuts, they intend to compile the ruling parties' outline for 
revision of the tax system for fiscal year 1994 on 8 February. 
  The centerpiece of the proposal package is the land tax 
system. The ruling parties have advocated the need to study a 
reduction of land value tax on land which "is used for public 
purposes." Moreover, in view of demands among the ruling parties 
for the abolition of land value tax, the package indicates: "The 
role of land tax value should be replaced with that of property 
taxes from a medium-to-long term point of view." At the same 
time, regarding alteration or abolition of land value tax, it 
stipulates the principle of "continuing the system itself for 
the time being." 
  Regarding the issue of increasing taxes on profits from 
transfer of corporations, the ruling parties have demanded that 
the present limit for a holding period be abolished and the tax 
rate be set at 10 percent in all cases. On this issue, the 
Ministry of Finance has already worked out its proposal: "The 
basic points of the tax such as the tax rate remain untouched 
and the scope of tax reduction for the sellers be expanded." 
However, the ruling parties' proposal package mentions "the 
current situation in which even if companies try to tackle 
restructuring in a bid to overcome the economic recession, they 
have to give up the plan due to the lack of financial 
resources." Thus, the package reflects demands made by 
Shinseito, Komeito, and other parties on the issue. 
  Regarding a special tax break for selling one's residential 
property to buy a more expensive one, the idea of easing 
conditions concerning transfer prices has now cropped up within 
the ruling coalition. However, the package points out: "The tax 
break system was already revised in 1993," and demands the 
current limit of "100 million yen" be maintained. Meanwhile, 
regarding a tax break for selling business property, the package 
proposes the introduction of special measures for selling 
depreciation assets from the viewpoint of promoting the 
restructuring of companies. 
  As for indirect taxes, the package clearly indicates a 
critical view of the growing demand within the government for 
increased liquor and tobacco taxes, saying: "It is difficult to 
seek public understanding of such an increase which may be 
regarded as an increase in the general public's tax burden." 
Regarding the issue of how taxes ought to be put on 
public-service corporations -- the issue is now being discussed 
as an example of the preferential taxation treatment -- the 
package stresses: "It is necessary to see that there are many 
cases where the preferential system of taxation is used badly 
and such cases should not be overlooked." Stating that "some 
measures should be taken to remedy the situation," the package 
proposes such measures as lowering limits of taxation on 
profit-making business to improve the taxation system.

<F P=106> [Article by Raisuke Miyawaki, Dentsu adviser, former cabinet </F>
Public Relations Office director: "The Structure of the Gang 
Recession About Which No One Writes: The Heisei Recession Is `a 
Gangster Recession'"] 
  [Text] The bubble has been cruelly burst and a 
two-stage bottoming out is expected for the economy, but 
gangsters have deeply penetrated corporations and stocked up a 
huge mountain of material for threats in that process. 
Full-scale extrication from the recession will be impossible 
without a countermeasure for this. 
  Over a year has past since the new gang law came into 
effect. 
It is believed that the new law is steadily taking root in 
Japanese society, but it cannot be said that corporate society, 
which has been on the verge of crisis, has been resuscitated 
because of it. Just by reviewing newspaper reports for the past 
several months, one can see an incident where five masked gang 
members fired five shots into the home of a bank president in 
Nagoya in September, and the vice president of a bank in 
Wakayama Prefecture was shot with a gun and died in August. From 
February to May, a series of fire bombs were thrown at the homes 
of branch offices of life insurance, bank, and real estate heads 
affiliated with a former zaibatsu. My true feeling is that "the 
crisis of corporate society" is still not over. 
  The current gang force is 90,600 people in 3,490 gangs. 
Among 
these are 56,600 full-fledged members, and the remaining 34,000 
are quasi-members. The big three, the Yamaguchi-gumi, 
Inagawa-kai, and Sumiyoshi-kai respectively have 37,200 people 
(41.4 percent), 9,800 people (10.8 percent), and 11,400 people 
(12.6 percent), and the aggregate total of the three gangs 
accounts for about 65 percent. 
  The National Police Agency [NPA] estimates the income for 
all 
these gangs at 1.3 trillion yen in 1989 figures. However, this 
is a very low estimate; it is probably several times that, 
certainly about 5 trillion yen, since it is a figure from before 
the bubble economy. Incidentally, the Mafia of the United States 
has a core of 5,000 people in 26 families, and their income is 
about 10 trillion yen. The Mafia of Italy is said to have an 
income between 2 trillion to 4 trillion yen. 
  The breakdown of the income of Japanese gangs, also in NPA 
estimates, is 34.4 percent or 450 billion yen in income from 
stimulant drugs; about three tons a year are smuggled in. Since 
about 33 shots can be made with one gram, it is an amount that 
reaches 100 million shots. Gambling, bucket shop operations, 
bodyguard fees, violent intervention in civic affairs, and 
violence against corporations are also big income sources. 
  In an investigation by the NPA, besides the aforementioned 
illegal income, 20 percent of the whole is considered to be 
income other than illegal such as corporate activities. However, 
this part of the income, which is not illegal, is much greater 
and has been estimated to be about equal to the illegal income. 
It is believed that the weight of this was especially high 
during the bubble period. 
<H5>  Transformation of Gangs </H5>
  There have been four characteristic changes in gangs in 
recent years. The first is oligopolization. The number of big 
three gang members was 24.6 percent of the whole in 1983. Since 
it currently is 65 percent, it calculates to a share increase of 
about 40 percent in the 10-year period. What the gangsters call 
"the force of the substitute family crest" and what the police 
call "the force of organization intimidation" is the motive 
force for oligopolization. 
  The Mafia in the United States and Italy have "an invisible 
existence." However, Japanese gangs, far from being invisible, 
are "visible gangs," and threaten by showing themselves openly. 
In order to threaten by showing themselves, it is more 
convenient to have great organizational backing. Profits are 
quite different when one can present a business card to show 
great organizational backing. Therefore, weak gangs all get 
under the umbrella of big gangs. A brake finally has begun to be 
put to that trend recently, but that is because the substitute 
family crest charge, or in other words, the payment to those in 
charge has become high and payment has become difficult. 
  The second change is infiltration into civic life and 
economic activities for fund resource activities. Before the new 
gang law was put into force in March 1992, there was "the 
principle of nonintervention in civic affairs" among the police 
and, speaking in extremes, gangs intervening in civic affairs 
were left alone in a situation close to noninterference. In the 
meantime, violent intervention in civic matters ballooned into a 
large income source for gangs. 
  Furthermore, there is violence targeted at corporations. Not 
only have gangs that have become political associations, 
including sokaiya [gangsters who promise not to 
disrupt shareholders' general meetings in return for payoffs or 
who work for companies in shouting down dissenting shareholders 
at such meetings], rapidly increased, but gangs of racketeers 
specializing in banks called "bank racketeers" have also 
appeared. Banks are overly concerned about appearances and 
easily become targets. 
  Furthermore, they have become active in dummy corporations. 
There are companies that supply oshibori [steamed 
towels to freshen hands] to bars and clubs, or lease paintings. 
Many have also advanced into civil engineering and construction 
or the financial business. A gang source calls these "legitimate 
businesses," but they are backed by the force of organization 
intimidation and the police do not view them as legitimate 
businesses so long as the groups are not disbanded. 
  The third change is armament. For about the past 10 years 
except for 1990, over 1,000 guns a year have been confiscated. 
Last year, it numbered 1,450, the highest in history. It is said 
that one gun has already been distributed to each gang member. 
  The fourth change is the advance of Japanese gangs overseas 
and the advance of foreign gangs into Japan, that is, the 
problem of the internationalization of gangs. The United States 
has two concerns about this. One is that it will be disastrous 
if those with good brains such as the Japanese come and form 
violent organizations. The Mafia in the United States originally 
was created by local people who were apt to be viewed lowly in 
American society, but in reality that group has seized the neck 
of the United States. Who is to say what would happen if 
Japanese who are said to have good brains came in. 
  The other is rooted in the so-called "Japanese uniqueness 
theory" advocated by revisionists. In other words, the viewpoint 
is rapidly spreading that Japan is a unique country that cannot 
get along without the association of gangsters. 
  In any case, their flashy actions overseas have been 
conspicuous such as purchasing golf courses in order to launder 
money earned during the bubble era. Contacts seeking a smuggling 
route for drugs are also becoming active and caution is 
necessary. 
  On the other hand, inroads into Japan by foreign gang 
organizations have become active along with the rapid increase 
in foreign workers. There are also activities organized by 
illegal residents and persons smuggled into the country. 
Organized crime groups from Taiwan and Hong Kong have already 
landed and situations where they are conspiring with Japanese or 
feuding with each other have become a reality. 
<H5>  Infiltration Into Corporate Society </H5>
  With the bubble economy sandwiched in between, the 
infiltration of gangs into corporations has become serious. 
  The first crisis when Japanese corporate society was 
infiltrated by gangs was about the time of revision of the 
Commercial Code in 1982. It is common knowledge that the 
sokaiya of the ruling party had the role of 
suppressing the sokaiya of the opposition parties in 
addition to being thoroughly familiar with the intimate details 
of corporations. The employment of gangs by those 
sokaiya to demonstrate power at general stockholder 
meetings was an opportunity for sokaiya inroads by 
gangs. At first, gangs came in cautiously, but they found that 
there was no other such profitable business. While in gangs, 
they had been treated as if they had no human rights by 
detectives of the Metropolitan Police Department, for instance, 
but as soon as they became sokaiya, they came to be 
called "sensei" [title of respect for teachers, doctors, etc.]. 
Prior to the 1982 revision of the Commercial Code, it is 
estimated that from 100 billion yen to 200 billion yen flowed to 
sokaiya. By gangs taking the place of 
sokaiya, the intimate details of corporations were 
grasped by the gangs. 
  Therefore, the Commercial Code was hastily revised. It 
prohibited provision of profits to sokaiya. In 
addition, the authority of the chairman at general stockholder 
meetings was strengthened, and the unit stock system was also 
introduced. By this, laws were prepared to eliminate 
sokaiya, and the existence of sokaiya was 
no longer necessary if there were resolute managers. Problems no 
longer occurred so long as they kept an attentive eye on 
management. 
  Nevertheless, they were not able to eliminate 
sokaiya entirely. When general meetings of the 
stockholders neared, some managers even become cross with the 
general affairs staff, demanding to know why they had to study 
such a thing, and sokaiya came to shake up such 
companies. Such a thing was solely a problem of manager 
attitude. 
  Although there was some decrease in sokaiya, they 
did not disappear completely because there were some companies 
giving profits to sokaiya. Then, the bubble economy 
occurred and the situation completely changed. 
<H5>  Greatest Shackle to Economic Recovery </H5>
  I say that the current Heisei recession is "a gangster 
recession," and many managers would agree and say, "That is 
right." The economists, however, do not seem to see the 
connection between gangs and the current recession. I believe 
that extrication from the recession will be impossible without 
this viewpoint. 
  There are three reasons for that. 
  First, some corporations transferred the excess money in the 
bubble era to stock, and moreover, some corporations rode the 
wave of urban redevelopment and invested in office buildings and 
planned for the construction of golf courses and leisure 
facilities. Land speculators were necessary for that, and many 
gangs were involved with land speculators. Initially, there was 
a middleman, but it soon became troublesome. Moreover, gangs 
always sought acquaintance with corporate officers. Cases of 
gang members and corporate employees drinking with each other 
increased, and the things they said, snide remarks about 
superiors, and other corporate gossip that was unintentionally 
revealed, looking at it now, are all becoming the material for 
their threats. 
  Moreover, although they depended on land speculators, there 
were many projects that collapsed midway. If that happened, the 
gangs learned how much loss was incurred by whose responsibility 
within the corporation. They also knew how much embellishment 
was made in the March 1992 settlement of accounts when the 
bubble burst, and how much coverup was made in the stockholders 
general meeting. 
  Even worse, gossip about the plans of corporation heads, 
starting with the creation of condos for when they retire and 
shifting company money to compensate for those losses, was also 
snared in the net of considerable information of the gangs. 
  The gangs believe that it will be to their advantage not to 
make threats immediately, but to intimidate them after corporate 
performance improves a little more. When the economy has begun 
to recover, there will be an increase in the corporations that 
cannot refuse if they propose to do new work jointly. By this, 
even if there is somewhat of an upturn in the economy, there 
will be no frame of mind for facilities investment. 
  Second, there is the problem of bad debts. As economists 
have 
also pointed out, a considerable portion of the bad debts, which 
some say amount to 40 trillion yen in financial institutions 
alone, are said to be related to gangs. There are some managers 
who seek help from gangs in disposing of bad debts, although 
they are not related to gangs. The relationship between bad 
debts and gangs is proceeding in a rather bad direction and 
there will be no resolution of the bad debt problem by ignoring 
gang countermeasures. 
  Third, the amassing of public works projects is being 
conducted as a recession countermeasure. However, from 1 percent 
to 3 percent of the public works expenditures have flowed to 
gangs under the pretext of periphery countermeasure expenses or 
cooperation money. Some say that if they don't pay money to 
gangs, they will not be allowed to go through the streets. That 
is because some gangs are involved in ready mixed concrete, 
gravel, and waste disposal businesses. In some areas gangs 
control dump trucks and the structure is such that projects are 
impossible without paying cooperation money. 
  Thus, gangs are incorporated into the basic structure of the 
Japanese economy. Even if the official rate is lowered, and even 
if public works projects are amassed, there is one more big 
factor why a clear response does not appear, and that is 
because we close our eyes to gangs. The media also has a 
serious responsibility for the gang problem. Even if illegal 
activities of bank branch managers occur, gang involvement is 
not reported until an announcement by the police. Before that, 
hardly anything is written about the bad parts of corporations, 
perhaps the result of corporate public relations 
countermeasures. It is said that "beat reporters" have made 
politics worse, but what about economic journalists? I believe 
that grave reflection is called for on the way journalists 
report about coporations. 
  Of course, it goes without saying that a strengthening of 
controls on underground money with the systematic cooperation of 
the police, National Tax Administration, and public prosecutors 
offices is necessary for extrication from the recession, but 
more than anything, self-awareness by managers is most 
important. They must have self-awareness that having 
relationships with gangs as a corporation and as an individual 
is itself a crime and keep in mind that gangs are organized 
criminal groups that will do anything for money. Extrication 
from the "gangster recession" will be impossible without a 
resolute attitude.

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] plans to set up "multimedia information centers" in 
several parts of Japan in a bid to nurture the multimedia 
industry, which deals with combined technologies for computers, 
communications devices, and home electric appliances. The 
centers will collect various kinds of information in the form of 
images, voice, and letters, and provide them to local businesses 
and schools. Moreover, they will help nurture information 
specialists and will be the pillar of a new social 
infrastructure. MITI also plans to improve information networks 
in government offices and public research institutes at the same 
time as the establishment of the information centers. It has 
demanded that 30 billion yen [Y] be allocated in the third 
supplementary budget for establishing the centers and Y50 
billion for improving information networks. 
  Multimedia technology makes it possible for computers to 
process, send, and receive several kinds of data such as 
letters, figures, still images, and moving images at one time. 
The technology is expected to be used widely in such areas as 
education, information searches, and entertainment. 
  MITI is to set up several multimedia information centers. 
Each center will collect information on regional culture and 
local businesses in the form of images and save them in the data 
base. It will be equipped with a device to search for the 
necessary information and project it onto a screen. 
  The centers will also have a device to composite and edit 
images and voice information. This device will enable teachers 
to make their own teaching materials for such purposes as 
scientific experiments and English conversation, and enable 
businesses to produce image software such as advertisement 
pictures. They will also give lectures regarding multimedia as 
a means to nurture information specialists. 
  Last year the government decided to establish a "multimedia 
support center." The decision, made as a measure to give 
all-around support to the development of multimedia software, 
was included in the government pump-priming package announced 
last year. The Information Technology Promotion Agency (IPA), a 
MITI-affiliated organization, is currently in the course of 
selecting a location where the multimdea support center is to be 
built. 
  The support center is to retain data amassed by the IPA. In 
the future, MITI will establish an information network 
connecting the multimedia support center and multimedia 
information centers so that localities will be able to make 
effective use of information from Tokyo. 
  MITI has demanded the government appropriate Y5 billion in 
the third supplementary budget for expanding the functions of 
the support center. Moreover, it has demanded: 1) Y5 billion 
for creating a research data base for the New Energy and 
Industrial Development Organization (NEDO); 2) about Y4 billion 
for establishing LAN (local area network) in public research 
institutes; and 3) Y3 billion for developing educational-use 
software. 
  According to some calculations, the domestic information and 
communications market will expand and be worth approximately Y67 
trillion at the highest estimate by the year 2000. The figure 
is about three times larger than the current market value. MITI 
has concluded that to encourage recession-plagued private firms 
to invest in the new business, it is necessary to create 
circumstances favorable for the information-related business.

<F P=106> [Report on exclusive interview with Yi Tong-pok, former </F>
special assistant at the Agency for National Security Planning, 
by SANKEI SHIMBUN reporter Katsuhiro Kuroda; place and date not 
given; first two paragraphs are introduction] 
  [Text] Seoul, 31 Jan -- Negotiations on the nuclear issue 
of the DPRK (North Korea) is now under way between North Korea 
and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) following 
U.S.-North Korea contacts. However, North Korea still refuses 
to accept nuclear inspections, leaving the issue unresolved. 
SANKEI SHIMBUN reporter Katsuhiro Kuroda has exclusively 
interviewed Yi Tong-pok, former special assistant at the Agency 
for National Security Planning, to ask about the prospects for 
the nuclear issue. Mr. Yi is said to have had profound 
experiences in negotiating with North Korea at the North-South 
talks since 1970. He is also known to have been South Korea's 
toughest negotiator with North Korea. 
  Mr. Yi resigned as the special assistant in late 1993 
following an incident involving his ignoring a presidential 
directive to South Korean negotiators at the North-South talks. 
It is said that the incident occurred because of a discord 
within the South Korean Government. In the exclusive interview, 
Mr. Yi said: 
<H5>  Concession Means Weakness </H5>
  It is said that I resigned because of a confrontation 
between 
hard- and moderate-liners [in the South Korean Government], but 
it is not true. It is better to say that I resigned because of 
differences between professionals and amateurs on North Korea. 
The Kim Yong-sam government's attitude toward North Korea 
appeared to be reconciliatory at first, but its attitude has now 
become tough after experiencing reality. There is no need to 
worry about the government's attitude toward North Korea. 
  There are some lessons for negotiating with communists. For 
example, in principle, no "agreement" should be reached with 
them that leaves room for them to interpret things their way. 
The agreement would be scrapped because of differences over the 
interpretation or the communists would press their counterpart 
to make concessions. The agreement must be phrased 
unequivocally and specifically. 
  A book entitled "Tactics for Negotiating With Communists," 
written by U.S. Admiral Joy [name as published] who was a chief 
delegate to truce talks with North Korea during the Korean war 
(1950-53) pointed out that North Korea used the tactic to 
tenaciously repeat its assertions and prolong the truce talks 
with the aim of getting its counterpart tired. North Korea is 
invariably using the same tactic. 
  In his book, Admiral Joy pointed out that 1) we must not 
ease 
our pressure; 2) we must not be impatient, but we must conclude 
talks with communists in a short period; 3) we must not make any 
concessions to which they do not reciprocate; 4) we must not 
step back from our original political aims; and 5) we must 
indicate that we will not hesitate to go to war with them if 
talks are broken off. I agree with his suggestions. 
<H5>  North Korea Has the Capability To Build Two Atomic Bombs </H5>
  It is wrong to view that North Korea has simply used the 
nuclear issue as a diplomatic card. Given the nature of the 
present North Korean system, North Korea is firmly determined to 
develop nuclear weapons. If North Korea has extracted plutonium 
from the operation of a 5-megawatt reactor since 1986, that 
country could now have about 15 kg of plutonium. This plutonium 
is enough to manufacture two Nagasaki-type atomic bombs. 
  If international nuclear inspections are put back on track, 
North Korea would no longer extract the plutonium. Fuel samples 
should be checked to determine how much plutonium North Korea 
has extracted and at the same time, international nuclear 
inspections need to be undertaken at North Korea's undeclared 
nuclear waste disposal sites. 
  For now, the United States and the IAEA appear to be 
intending to keep North Korea from extracting additional 
plutonium by having North Korea accept the international nuclear 
inspections on its declared nuclear facilities and to deal 
tenaciously with plutonium in the hands of North Korea with the 
determination of risking North Korea's manufacturing nuclear 
weapons. As a precedent, South Africa has dismantled its 
nuclear weapons after developing them. 
<H5>  Economic Sanctions in Near Future </H5>
  In negotiations with the IAEA, North Korea has accepted only 
one-time inspections of its undeclared nuclear sites. The third 
round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks may be held, but the 
talks will face an impasse because of North Korea's continued 
opposition to both special and normal inspections. 
  North Korea will try to negotiate at every stage of 
inspections and to buy time. In response, argument for imposing 
economic sanctions against North Korea will grow and the 
argument may lead the UN Security Council to decide on economic 
sanctions against North Korea. 
  How long will the IAEA and the United States be patient with 
North Korea's suspected nuclear development? In the near 
future, North Korea will stand at a crossroad of making a hard 
choice between its renunciation of nuclear development and its 
formal withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  Since the nuclear issue has arisen from North Korea's 
system, 
the issue cannot be resolved fundamentally without a qualitative 
change in the system. 
  The United States is moving in the direction of increasing 
its pressure on North Korea with the aim of causing the 
qualitative change in the system.

  [Text] The last military operation of the puppets and the 
two-headed government at Anlung Veng area has been completely 
defeated. 
  1. On 31 January, the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea 
[NADK] and the local people routed the military operation of the 
communist Vietnam's puppets and the two-headed government at 
Anlung Veng area. 
  2. During five days of fighting from 27 to 31 January, 
puppet military top commanders Ke Kimyan, Pol Saroeun, Long 
Sopheap, Prum Samen, and Keo Pisit mobilized all their remaining 
forces on the front with 10 tanks, five military trucks, and 600 
troops in their last all-out attempt on Anlung Veng. Their 
forces were facing a big dilemma as they could neither withdraw 
back to Samraong or move forward. They knew that if they tried 
to advance, they would be annihilated. Therefore, they decided 
to open their life line from Prey Phdau, (Pradev), (Thvoeuk), 
Rumchek, and Siem Reap even though it meant crossing mine fileds. 
  3. However, the NADK and local people were able to intercept 
them and cut them into several separate units. Particularly on 
31 January, we destroyed five tanks; the other five tried to 
escape but we were able to destroy two of them and capture 
three. Of the 600 troops, [words indistinct] have been 
paralyzed by malaria and other diseases, 115 have deserted and 
rejoined Siem Reap where they have made a lot of noise about 
their defeat. In addition, we have been able to capture 60 of 
their remaining 250 puppet soldiers. 
  4. Prum Samen himself was wounded for the second time (?east 
of) Prey Phdau when our NADK launched a special attack against 
his mobile headquarters located near the site of their multiple 
rocket launchers and heavy artilleries. Once wounded, Prum 
Samen [words indistinct]. 
  5. The communist Vietnamese, the entente, and the two-headed 
government have met with severe defeat [words indistinct]. 
However, the (?50) percent of their total forces and 90 percent 
of their commanders in Cambodia have been seriously affected by 
the fighting during the whole month of January. 
  If they persist in continuing the war in opposing the 
five-point national reconciliation plan of his majesty the king, 
the entire Cambodian nation and people, both in the countryside 
and in Phnom Penh, will inflict more enormous defeats on them 
and will certainly achieve the five-point national 
reconciliation.

  [Text] A report on recent attacks conducted by the 
National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] and the people to 
rout military offensives launched by the troops of the 
Vietnamese communists' puppets and the two-headed government: 
  1. The troops of the Vietnamese communists' puppets and the 
two-headed government on 20 January carried out offensive 
attacks on (Tuol Kruos) and (Tuol Thnoeng) villages at Prey Svay 
commune in Moung District of Battambang Province. The NADK and 
people intercepted them when they approached the villages. We 
killed 16 enemy soldiers, wounded many others, and forced the 
others to beat a hasty retreat. The NADK and people have 
controlled the two villages completely. 
  2. The enemy troops on 22 January attacked Kaoh Tei commune 
in Moung District of Battambang Province. They were, however, 
intercepted by the NADK and the people. As a result, 12 were 
killed and others wounded. The remaining troops were forced to 
retreat in a shameful manner. We seized seven assorted guns and 
some war materiel. 
  3. On the same day, the NADK and the people intercepted and 
completely routed offensive attacks conducted by two companies 
of the Vietnamese communists' puppets and two-headed government 
near Rumchek and [name indistinct] villages at Prey Svay commune 
in Moung District of Battambang Province. We killed 19 enemy 
soldiers and wounded 11 others and have gained complete control 
of the two villages. 
  4. The enemy soldiers on 26 January raided Cham Chas, Phteah 
Peach, and Phteah Sdok villages at Chheu Tom commune in Krakor 
District of Pursat Province. The NADK and the people 
intercepted and completely routed them when they approached the 
villages. We killed 21 enemy soldiers and wounded 30 others, 
and we seized 15 guns and some war materiel. We have exerted 
full control over the three villages.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] Last week, the U.S. Senate debated and endorsed the 
establishment of Radio Free Asia with the aim of beaming news to 
China, Myanmar [Burma], Tibet, the DPRK, Cambodia, Vietnam, and 
the Lao Peoples's Democratic Republic [LPDR]. They claimed that 
peoples in these countries lacked complete freedom of expression 
and regarded the setting up of the radio station as an 
instrument for conveying varied views to those peoples. 
  It is well known that during the Cold War period, the United 
States utilized Radio Free Europe as one of its tools to oppose 
the socialist countries in eastern Europe. That radio station 
played an important role in interfering in the internal affairs 
of those countries. In the last decade of the 20th century, 
while the United States and other countries throughout the world 
are expeditiously seeking ways to increase mutual cooperation 
and understanding, the United States itself is considering 
setting up a Radio Free Asia to oppose the countries in Asia. 
It is surprising indeed. 
  The LPDR Foreign Affairs Ministry is of the view that the 
establishment of Radio Free Asia by the Unites States runs 
counter to the trend of promoting cooperation and creating peace 
in this region and throughout the world. The only thing the 
peoples and governments in this region want is that they hope 
the United States will use other means of communications in an 
effort to contribute to building mutual trust to facilitate the 
promotion of economic, scientific, cultural, social cooperation, 
and peace in Southeast Asia and the world.

  [Text] Speaking to reporters on the effect on Thailand of 
the U.S. decision to lift the trade embargo against Vietnam, 
Deputy Commerce Minister Churin Laksanawisit said one favorable 
effect is that Thai and U.S. investors will be able to jointly 
invest in businesses in that country. However, there will be an 
adverse consequence in the agricultural area, as Vietnam will 
become a formidable competitor of Thailand in the future. 
Churin said: 
  [Begin Churin recording, in progress] ...our agricultural 
products such as rubber and coffee. Vietnam also produces these 
crops and the United States is a big coffee-consuming country. 
The negative side is that Vietnam will become our competitor in 
the U.S. market. The United States is the third biggest market 
for our coffee. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Chokchai Aksoranan, chairman of the Chamber of 
Industries of Thailand, said foreign investment in Vietnam will 
increase. American investors can join hands with their Thai 
counterparts in that country. Hence, Vietnam's demand for 
commodities will rise and this will benefit the marketing of 
Thai products. However, in the long run, Thai entrepreneurs 
must readjust and reduce their production costs to compete with 
Vietnam.

  [Text] The Thai private sector yesterday welcomed the 
imminent lifting of the U.S. embargo on Vietnam and said Thai 
business would benefit most. Chokechai Aksaranan, president of 
the Federation of Thai Industries, said the move would directly 
benefit Thai business. The fact that Thailand and Vietnam are 
geographically close will help transport of goods such as 
consumer products and construction materials which Vietnam wants 
very much, he said. Thailand will be in the most advantageous 
position to be a springboard for investment in Vietnam. 
  Mr Chokechai expects more Thai investors to seek joint 
ventures with Americans to invest in Vietnam because of the 
United States' higher technology. 
  A Thai Petrochemical Industry Co executive, Prachai 
Leophairatana, said the lifting of the embargo, if it occurred, 
would greatly expand business in Vietnam because of the flood of 
foreign capital into that country. The end of the sanctions 
will enable new investors to enter Vietnam and this will be a 
good time for Thai businessmen to sell their products. 
  As Mr Prachai is in the petrochemical industry dealing with 
plastic and cement, he noted that this would be a good chance to 
sell building materials to Vietnam. In supplying construction 
materials such as cement, the country with the best advantage 
will be the nearest because transport of the commodity costs a 
lot. 
  In the short term, Thai investors will be in a better 
position than others, but in the long run, if Thai investors do 
not adapt, they will be disadvantaged particularly in terms of 
competition in marketing and technology, he said. 
  Thirachit Satirotwong, a member of the Federation of Thai 
Industries, said Thai businessmen had prepared for a long time 
and sent several teams to explore investment opportunities in 
Vietnam. He expects more investment if the embargo is lifted. 
  A United Gommunication Industry (UCOM) executive, who 
declined to be named, said that UCOM recently approached 
Vietnamese authorities to join an iridium project to link 
Indochina with the rest of the world. 
  Vietnam had agreed but could not join officially because of 
the embargo, he said. The lifting of the embargo will clear the 
way for Vietnam to take part. 
  The $3.3-billion iridium system is a worldwide, digital, 
satellite-based cellular personal communications system designed 
mainly to provide commercial and governmental links through 
mobile phones within a country and abroad. He said sole agents 
of American products in the region, particularly in Thailand, 
would directly benefit from the lifting of sanctions. 
  As most American products have Thais as their sole agents in 
the region, particularly telecommunications products, their 
markets will expand. 
  Although competition is expected from Hong Kong and 
Singapore 
agents for American products, the early dominance of Thais in 
the Vietnamese market will be an advantage. 
  Americans would not directly invest in Vietnam for reasons 
of 
history, he believes. Also, the size of the market is not 
large, about 60 million, and most people are poor. Business 
would probably be done through barter. Rigid regulations on 
money transactions would not attract American investors, he said.

  [Text] Relations between Thailand and Saudi Arabia have 
improved considerably with Saudi authorities admitting skilled 
and unskilled Thai workers, Thai Charge d'Affaires to Saudi 
Arabia Mahadi Wimana said yesterday. Saudi authorities are now 
issuing reentry visas to unskilled Thai workers who previously 
found it difficult to obtain such permission after an absence 
from the country, he said 
  Skilled workers remained much in demand as goldsmiths, 
gardens and auto repairs, he said. But the pay was not as good 
as in the past few years so Thai workers should not expect too 
much. At the same time, the number of Saudi nationals applying 
for entry visas to Thalland has increased significantly. A 
total of 7,000 people, mainly those aged over 30, submitted 
applications last year, he said. 
  When relations were more strained, Saudi employers took 
workers from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines. They 
were being paid at lower rates of about 2,800 baht a month he 
said.

  [Text] Australia has welcomed the U.S. decision to lift its 
embargo on Vietnam. A spokesperson for the foreign minister, 
Gareth Evans, said although the decision does not include the 
establishment of diplomatic relations, it is a positive step 
toward Vietnam's acceptance in the international community. The 
spokesperson says the increased competition which is likely to 
result between Australian and U.S. firms in Vietnam should also 
be welcomed.

  [Text] Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, says 
everyone will benefit from the lifting of America's embargo on 
Vietnam. Senator Evans says Australia has been pushing 
President Clinton and his administration on the issue: 
  [Begin Evans recording] We have been urging him and previous 
administrations to go down this route, of course, for a very 
long time. We have regarded it as, quite frankly, absurd that 
the POW-MIA issue should have occupied the time and attention 
and been the distraction that it was. Obviously it is in 
everyone's interest that there be a resumption of major economic 
activity in Vietnam, and we are very glad that has happened. 
[end recording] 
  Sen. Evans said Australian industry should not fear American 
competition in Vietnam, because it should generate higher 
economic activity. The foreign minister said Australian 
industry was much more internationally competitive and Australia 
already had an established track record in Vietnam. 
  Belinda Tromp reports that the American decision is expected 
to remove some obstacles for Australian investors: 
  [Begin recording] [Tromp] With a literacy rate of around 80 
percent and a government keen to achieve rapid economic growth, 
Vietnam has some of the fundamentals for attracting new 
investment. What is missing, according to an executive member 
of the Australia-Vietnam Business Council, Robert Wilcox, is a 
modern bureaucracy. 
  [Wilcox] The Vietnamese need to move, I believe, more 
quickly 
with their reforms -- in getting their legal system together, 
getting their administrative act together -- as a result of this. 
  [Tromp] Mr. Wilcox says the reputation and expertise 
established by Australian companies already in Vietnam -- such 
as BHP, Telecom, and the ANZ Bank -- put Australian companies in 
a good position for the onset of competition from U.S. 
investors. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["Sophism for Justifying Deployment of Patriot Missiles in </F>
S. Korea"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 4 (KCNA) -- Kim Chong-pil, 
"chairman of the Democratic Liberal Party [DLP]" of South Korea, 
told a press conference on February 1 that the deployment of 
U.S. Patriot missiles in South Korea will actually offer "no 
problem" in view of "defence." 
  Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says his remarks are 
intolerable treacherous sophism unacceptable to anyone. 
  The traitor Kim Chong-pil's sophism fully revealed the 
bellicose and treacherous nature of the "civilian" regime and 
the "DLP" of South Korea, the analyst notes, and stresses: 
  Kim Chong-pil, a special-class flunkeyist traitor and 
warmaniac, is the first target of reforms in South Korea. 
  His utterances proved again that the Kim Yong-sam regime 
seeking dependence on outside forces, division and war, not 
national independence, peace and reunification, must be 
overthrown. 
  We have warned more than once that if the Kim Yong-sam group 
dare to seek the provocation of a war, the "civilian" following 
the aggressive war moves of outside forces, the civilian" regime 
would meet its miserable doom. 
  The South Korean "civilian" warmaniacs must look squarely at 
the situation and act with discretion.

  [Text] According to a military source, the U.S. 
imperialists dragged in formations of fighter planes in the 
skies of the South Korean region from their overseas base on 3 
February and carried out long-range bombing exercises aimed at 
the northern half of the Republic. 
  On the same day, an electronic jamming plane 
[chonjajangaegi], which flew into the skies of the regions of 
Yongwol and Pyongchang from Japan's (?Yokosuka) base, created 
electronic jamming in this region. Also, they were running amok 
in the concentrated attack exercise of invading the skies of the 
operational regions by formations of pursuit assault planes and 
vertical take-off and landing assault crafts which took off from 
an overseas base. 
  This very provocative war exercise was playing with fire to 
enhance the capability of unexpected attack amid electronic 
jamming. 
  Also on this day, the South Korean puppets continuously 
mobilized and deployed some 20 tanks and 300 armed hooligans 
from Manu-ri toward Ogok-ri, Paju County, Kyonggi Province. In 
addition, they kicked up a commotion of dragging in and 
assembling large-caliber guns in the whole area of (Kagong)-ri, 
Inje County, Kangwon Province, South Korea to the DMZ of the 
Military Demarcation Line.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 4 (KCNA) -- The U.S. 
imperialists and the South Korean, puppets staged a joint air 
war exercise in the skies above Tanyang, Yongwol, Kunwi and 
Chunchon, South Korea on February 2 to test the feasibility of a 
unified command by the E-3 early warning plane and increase the 
capability of a surprise strike at the North, according to 
military sources. 
  Some 350 warplanes including F-16, F-15, F-4, F-5 and A-10 
participated in the exercise. 
  Timing to coincide with this exercise, a formation of 
Okinawa- based refuelling tankers KC-135 refuelled scores of 
fighter bombers in the skies above Kwangju and Kunsan, South 
Korea, inciting the war atmosphere.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 4 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of 
the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland 
issued information No. 642 Thursday. 
  The information says: 
  At a time when the bellicose quarters of the United States 
threatened to take "sanctions" against the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea after setting a deadline under the pretext of 
"nuclear arms development" by the DPRK, the U.S. imperialist 
aggression forces and the South Korean puppet Army have staged 
an unbroken chain of war exercises and military provocations 
against the DPRK. This is very dangerous moves. 
  The U.S. and South Korean warmaniacs are scheming to 
introduce Patriot missiles into South Korea as part of their 
attempt to overpower the DPRK militarily. They have brought 
into South Korea and set in motion a "U.S. state 
intelligence-supporting team" for war preparations to "intensify 
espionage on the North." 
  All these ill-boding military moves indicate that the war 
preparations of the United States and the South Korean rulers 
have got into full stride and they are now going to take a 
practical military action by inventing a pretext. 
  If the U.S. and South Korean hardline conservatives attempt 
to frighten the DPRK with military threat it is a foolish act. 
  We have already solemnly stated that we are prepared either 
for dialogue or for war. 
  If the U.S. and South Korean bellicose circles persistently 
seek military adventures, ignoring the DPRK's patient efforts 
for peace, they will be held fully responsible for the grave 
situation created by them.

KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 4 (KCNA) -- A NODONG SINMUN 
analyst today says it is inevitable that the Kim Yong-sam 
puppet clique meet a miserable end by the massive resistance of 
the people. 
  Recalling that the Kim Yong-sam group incriminated peasants' 
rally held on February 1 to check the rice market opening and 
has countered it with ruthless fascist suppression, the news 
analyst says: 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam who deserves stern punishment by 
the 
people for his arch crimes is exasperatingly brandishing the 
sword against the people, growling. This tells that the Kim 
Yong-sam group is, indeed, a pack of despicable and wicked 
traitors who are lost to human reason and without an iota of 
national conscience. 
  Always miserable was the end of the successive traitors who 
attempted to find a way out through ruthless suppression. 
  Brutal suppression by the traitor Kim Yong-sam will only 
touch off a fiercer resistance of the South Korean people who 
rose to overthrow the "civilian" regime.

<F P=106> ["Flunkeyist and Traitorous Regime Must Be Toppled" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 4 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim 
Yong-sam finds himself in the lot of a miserable dog forsaken by 
the South Korean people although it is less than one year since 
he seated himself at the helm of power as "president" of the 
"civilian regime", because the treacherous crimes he has 
committed against the people are too diabolic and hideous, says 
a NODONG SINMUN analyst Thursday. 
  One of the traitor Kim's crimes is that he has bartered away 
the national interests, rushing headlong along the road of 
dependence on foreign forces, the news analyst says and goes on: 
  Whenever an occasion offered itself, such as "summit talks" 
and "security consultative meeting" with its American master, 
his clique begged them to shelve the "U.S. troop cutback plan" 
and did not hesitate to sell off the national interests for this 
purpose. 
  The puppets have committed criminal acts, prettifying the 
U.S. forces as a "war deterrent", "apostle of peace". 
  It is the traitor Kim Yong-sam who promised the American 
master behind closed doors to open the rice market and finally 
signed the memorandum of agreement on the opening. The rice 
market opening will drive the South Korean agriculture to total 
bankruptcy, cut off the lifeline of the six million peasants and 
exert a catastrophic influence on the economy as a whole. 
  The pro-Japanese flunkeyist treacheries of the puppets are 
arch crimes putting their predecessors into the shade. 
  The traitor Kim absolved Japan of its past crimes and made a 
clean sheet of the question of compensation to the "comfort 
women for the army", crying for "establishment of new South 
Korea-Japan relations" not bound to the past, and committed a 
criminal act of flinging the door open wider for its economic 
reinvasion. 
  All the more hideous is the fact that he has been trying to 
do harm to fellow countrymen with the help of foreign sword. 
  Raising a hue and cry over the fiction of "suspected nuclear 
development of the North", the puppets have left no stone 
unturned in a bid to stifle the North in league with foreign 
forces. 
  They have raised the North's "nuclear problem" at the UN and 
other international organisations to seek "pressure" and 
"sanctions" against the North. 
  Facts vividly show how many treacherous crimes the traitor 
Kim has committed during not a long period of his office. 
  The people will never pardon the group of traitors to the 
nation.

Seoul on February 2 for "saving our agriculture" and strongly 
demanded that the puppet authorities renegotiate the opening of 
the market of farm products with the United States, according to 
a radio report from Seoul. 
  The organisations shared the view that if impasse was solved 
at the Uruguay Round talks, South Korean agriculture would be 
driven to the hopeless doom of bankruptcy. They declared that 
they would hold civic rallies in 10 areas of South Korea 
including Seoul from February 5 to urge renegotiation on the 
Uruguay Round of multi-lateral trade relations.

  [Text] The chief of the DPRK Permanent Mission to the UN 
Secretariat and International Agencies in Geneva delivered a 
speech at a Geneva arms control meeting now being held in 
Switzerland. 
  During his speech, he said that the DPRK and the United 
States released a joint statement on the principles which the 
two sides discussed and reached agreement on in the talks and 
that talks and contacts have taken place to implement the joint 
statement. 
  Referring to the details of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement, 
he 
said that based on the principle of the joint statement, on 
which the agreement was reached, we have up until today taken 
practical measures to fairly resolve the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula and made sincere efforts to implement the joint 
statement. 
  He went on to say: The DPRK has unilaterally, temporarily 
suspended the effectuation of its declaration on withdrawing 
from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and resumed dialogue 
with the International Atomic Energy Agency. Even under special 
circumstances, to implement its promise to prove the 
transparency of its nuclear activities, the DPRK has completely 
frozen the movement of nuclear materials in its territory and 
even accepted inspections for guaranteeing the continuity of 
safeguards. In particular, to fundamentally bring an end to 
suspicions over our nuclear development, we have even taken a 
bold decision to replace the existing graphite-moderated atomic 
reactors with light-water reactors even at the cost of the 
independence of our nuclear power industry. However, we have 
not seen any corresponding practical action by the United States 
[kurona urinun miguk chuguro puto silchonjoguro houngul patchi 
mothayossumyo], and the recent situation is developing toward 
the extreme opposite direction. This is completely due to the 
insincere, unjust acts of the United States, the dialogue 
partner. 
  He stated a DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman released a 
statement on 31 January in connection with the prevailing 
situation. He introduced the details of the statement.

  [Text] On 1 February a news conference was held at our 
country's embassy in Russia concerning the 31 January statement 
by a Foreign Ministry spokesman. Present at the conference were 
reporters from newspapers, news agencies, and radios of Russia. 
  Son Song-pil, ambassador of our country, made a statement at 
the news conference. He explained the details of the Foreign 
Ministry statement. He pointed out that the nuclear problem on 
the Korean peninsula has been raised as a grave issue today 
because the United States, deploying more than 1,000 nuclear 
weapons to South Korea, staged commotions about suspicions of 
our nonexistent nuclear arms development and has intensified the 
nuclear threat to us now more than ever before. 
  He said: The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in his New 
Year address taught that the reason our nuclear issue is loudly 
talked about by the United States and its followers is a result 
of the antisocialist and anti-Republic maneuvers persistently 
pursued by the United States. 
  Therefore, the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula is an 
issue that should be resolved only through talks between us and 
the United States. With a view to evading such responsibility, 
however, the United States insists that the nuclear problem on 
the Korean peninsula be resolved between the North and the South 
of Korea, and between us and the International Atomic Energy 
Agency. 
  The United States, being unable to stand our principled 
demand any longer, was compelled to come forward to negotiate 
with us. 
  He pointed out that a joint statement, which had affirmative 
significance in resolving the nuclear problem on the Korean 
peninsula, was announced during the first round of DPRK-U.S. 
talks last year, after which a certain progress was made in the 
second round of DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  He continued: As the result of 18 rounds of working-level 
contacts between the DPRK and the United States, the two sides 
have reached an agreement on basic issues. We agreed that the 
United States will suspend the Team Spirit joint military 
exercise and we will accept limited-scope [chaehandoen pomwieso] 
nuclear inspections to ensure the continuity of safeguards. We 
agreed to discuss the package solution plan, which we raised, 
during the forthcoming third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  However, the United States, at a decisive moment when a 
bright vista for a complete resolution of the nuclear issue of 
the Korean peninsula is being opened up, is leading the 
situation to a catastrophe by overturning agreements made with 
us. This is not only a flagrant infringement of the agreements 
made at the DPRK-U.S. talks, but is also a shameless breach of 
faith against the dialogue. As the conditions under which we had 
to withdraw from the Nonproliferation Treaty still remain, the 
word of full-scope inspection, as well, is inconceivable. 
  Not only this, the United States is continuing military 
conspiratorial plots against us behind the scene of the talks. 
The United States is scheming to stage another type of military 
exercise in case the Team Spirit joint military exercise is not 
staged and to deploy Patriot missiles to South Korea. 
  All facts clearly show that the new war provocation 
maneuvers 
in South Korea are more unscrupulous and that the United States 
has no intention to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula by peaceful means and is also tenaciously running wild 
to crush [apsal] our Republic. 
  We cannot overlook such pressure and threats by the United 
States, nor can we yield to them. In this connection, the 
spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country 
expressed, in a statement, our principled stance. 
  In the statement the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman 
warned that if the United States reneges on promises made to us, 
we will not be bound to the promises made to the United States; 
that if the United States has no intention to hold DPRK-U.S 
talks, we will not try to hold them either; and that if the 
United States chooses another way, we will take a commensurate 
countermeasure. 
  We are fully prepared to respond to dialogue with dialogue 
and to war with war. [urinun taehwaenun taehwaro chonjaengenun 
chonjaenguro taedaphal mandanui chunbiga toeoitta] 
  The United States should renounce the delusion that only it 
has the right of choice and to act discreetly. 
  Then, he answered questions raised by reporters.

<F P=106> ["DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman Warns Against Japan's </F>
Nuclear Armament That Has Reached a Dangerous Phase" -- KCNA 
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 4 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
DPRK Foreign Ministry issued a statement today regarding Japan's 
design to produce nuclear weapons by securing plutonium by 
itself. 
  The statement says: 
  According to reports, Japan will soon ignite monju, its 
first 
fast breeder reactor. This is an undisguised attempt of Japan 
to secure quantities of plutonium by itself and produce nuclear 
weapons any moment. 
  The annual capacity of the reprocessing plant of Japan is 
800 
tons, the biggest in the world. When it goes into full 
operation by the end of the present century, Japan will rank 
third in the world in reprocessing capacity after the United 
States and France. 
  Even according to data released by the Japan science and 
technology agency, it has already stockpiled 1.6 tons of 
plutonium at home and 2.9 tons abroad and will possess 50 tons 
of plutonium at all times by 2010, an amount enough to make more 
than 6,200 nuclear bombs. 
  Japan has already developed not only electronic detonating 
device and other elements for the manufacture of nuclear bombs 
and their technologies but also long-range means of nuclear 
delivery that can be used as intercontinental ballistic missiles. 
  Facts tell that Japan's nuclear armament now has reached a 
dangerous phase. 
  In view of the tense situation in which Japan's nuclear 
armament is being stepped up around the Korean peninsula in real 
earnest, we cannot but follow such developments with vigilance. 
  Japan's stepped-up nuclear armament means creating an 
obstacle to the process of denuclearization on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  Denuclearization of Northeast Asia must be realized if peace 
and security free from nuclear weapons are to be guaranteed 
substantially in this region including the Korean peninsula. To 
this end, not only Asia but the rest of the world should pay due 
attention to Japan which is capable of possessing nuclear 
weapons and moving in that direction. 
  Denuclearization of Northeast Asia should lead to a total 
elimination of nuclear weapons worldwide.

<F P=106> ["Samurai's Dream of Aggression on Korea" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 4 (KCNA) -- The former chairman 
of the Joint Staff Council of the Self-Defence Forces, and a new 
advisor to the Defence Agency of Japan, Sakuma, in his lecture 
before military officials some time ago, prattled that deep 
studies should be made in advance to be prepared for "an 
emergency on the Korean peninsula." 
  Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says that the 
Japanese reactionaries overheated in their ambition for 
reinvasion are trying to move up the time of action. 
  The news analyst says: 
  "Studies of an emergency on the Korean peninsula" proposed 
by 
Sakuma may be called a plan for a Korean war in the 90s after 
the end of the Cold War. 
  Such move of Japan is all the more grave because it is timed 
to coincide with the intensified activities of the United States 
and the South Korean puppets for a war against the North. Its 
gravity lies in that Japan has been put in the position of "a 
party concerned" with a new Korean war. 
  The Japanese reactionaries have chosen the Korean peninsula 
as the first target of their military aggression overseas. 
  Their haste in "studies of an emergency on the Korean 
peninsula", in fact, suggests that they, together with the South 
Korean puppets, are rounding off an operational plan to start a 
war of aggression in Korea and watching for a chance to carry it 
into practice. 
  The Korean people will never allow the repetition of the 
history of aggression by the Japanese imperialists and we are 
prepared to resolutely react, if anybody attempt to infringe 
upon our sovereignty and dignity. 
  Japanese samurais must act with discretion, mindful that 
aggression and war will lead them to destruction.

Provocation Moves Against North" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Tokyo, February 2 (KNS-KCNA) -- Kim Chong-su, 
chairman of the Association of Koreans in Japan for Peaceful 
Reunification, in a statement February 2 said that the scheme of 
the United States to introduce a military intelligence team and 
a large quantity of latest weapons into South Korea and stage 
massive military exercises are an unpardonable criminal act to 
further reduce South Korea not only to a colony and military 
base but also to a nuclear forward base and military 
intelligence centre of the United States and, for the present, 
bar the DPRK-USA talks and bring the situation on the Korean 
peninsula to the grave brink of war. 
  Noting that the United States has no intention at all to 
solve the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula by peaceful 
means and still seek to stifle the DPRK with strength, he said: 
  "This is a shameless perfidy to the dialogue partner. The 
United States must immediately stop the reckless new war 
provocation moves and get out of South Korea without delay and 
the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime must unconditionally discontinue 
its flunkeyist treacheries and stop seeking North-South 
confrontation."

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 3 (KCNA) -- Broad political and 
public circles of the world exposed the brutalities of the 
Japanese imperialists in drafting Korean women as "comfort women 
for the army", and strongly demanded apology and adequate 
compensation in this matter. 
  Seiji Yoshida, one of the Japanese responsible for the 
forcible drafting of "comfort women for the army," at a press 
interview said the then patriotic labor service bureau of great 
Japan was in charge of the forcible drafting of Koreans and he 
himself directly commanded the forcible drafting of some 1,000 
"comfort women for the army". 
  The Belgian paper SOLIDAIRE said that during World War II 
the 
Japanese Army forcibly drafted Korean women and used them as its 
sexual playthings. After gratifying their carnal desire 
Japanese soldiers unhesitatingly committed brutal atrocities 
which would make even beasts blush with shame, such as 
dismembering and burning them en masse, it said. 
  The Nepalese paper NAYA HANGK said that the drafting of 
nearly 200,000 Korean women as "comfort women for the army" is 
the most diabolic of the crimes committed by the Japanese 
imperialists. 
  The Japanese authorities must apologize to mankind for the 
sexual crimes and compensate to the Korean people, the paper 
wrote. 
  Ridi Alajandro, general secretary of the new progressive 
union of the Philippines, said Japan must be brought to justice 
for drafting a large number of Korean women and forcing them to 
serve as "comfort women for the army" during the Second World 
War. 
  The Malaysian paper NEW STRAITS TIMES said that Japan must 
immediately apologize for the criminal acts it committed against 
the "comfort women for the army" and pay adequate compensation 
to the victims. If Japan refuses this, it will face strong 
denunciation and a stern judgement by the world public, it said.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 4 (KCNA) -- A North Hamgyong 
provincial meeting was held in Chongjin on February 3 to mark 
the 60th anniversary of the historic conference of party and 
revolutionary organisations in the homeland convened and guided 
by the great leader President Kim Il-song. 
  Early in February 1934 during the anti-Japanese armed 
struggle, President Kim Il-song went to then Mipo-Myon, Onsong 
County, North Hamgyong Province, and called and guided the 
conference of party and revolutionary organisations in the 
homeland. 
  Yi Kun-mo, chief secretary of the North Hamgyong provincial 
committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and chairman of the 
North Hamgyong provincial people's committee, made a report. 
  The reporter said: 
  At the conference, the great leader set forth the task to 
forcefully conduct the work of building party organisations in 
close combination with the armed struggle and the mass struggle. 
  He also put forward the task to set up regional guidance 
organs such as district party committees in the regions where 
many basic party organisations had been formed and skillfully 
apply in party leadership principles and methods of underground 
work suited to the conditions of secret activities. 
  The great leader expounded the questions of thoroughly 
applying the principle of democratic centralism in party 
leadership, ensuring the purity of the party ranks and their 
unity in ideology and purpose, extensively forming anti-Japanese 
mass underground organisations and fully ensuring their guidance 
by party organisations, enhancing the militant function and role 
of party organisations at all levels and giving effective 
assistance to the anti-Japanese guerrillas and guerrilla-held 
zones. 
  Indeed, the conference was a historic one which marked a new 
milestone in lifting the work of chuche-type revolutionary party 
building to a new higher stage and a significant one which gave 
a strong impetus to the development of the revolutionary 
movement as a whole.

  [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Vietnam has 
issued a statement on the U.S. President's decision to lift the 
trade embargo on Vietnam. The statement said: 
  On 3 February 1994, President Bill Clinton declared the 
lifting of the embargo on Vietnam and proposed the mutual 
establishment of liaison offices in the two countries. This is 
a positive and significant decision which contributes to opening 
a new page in the U.S.-Vietnam relations in the interests of the 
two peoples. This decision meets the desire of the American and 
Vietnamese peoples as well as of many other countries. It is in 
line with the trend toward peace, development in Asia-Pacific, 
and in the world. The improvement in U.S.-Vietnam relations 
will make a significant contribution to the common endeavor of 
the countries of the world for the sake of peace, friendship, 
and cooperation among nations. 
  The Government and people of Vietnam welcome this decision 
of 
the American Government. On this occasion, the Vietnamese 
Government affirms its policy whereby it consistently attaches 
importance to relations with the United States and wishes for 
normal relations between the two countries on the basis of 
respect for each other's independence and sovereignty, 
noninterference in each other's internal affairs, equality, and 
mutual benefit. Proceeding from such a position, Vietnam will 
continue to cooperate fully with the American Government and 
people in solving pending issues between the two countries. 
  Vietnam accepts the establishment of liaison offices in the 
respective capitals to be seen as a transitional step toward 
full diplomatic relations.

  [Excerpts] Dear friends: The Vietnamee Foreign Ministry 
held a news conference in Hanoi this afternoon on U.S. President 
Bill Clinton's decision to lift the trade embargo against 
Vietnam and to open a U.S. liaison office in Hanoi. 
  The news conference was presided over by Deputy Foreign 
Minister Le Mai and was attended by a large number of local and 
foreign news reporters. The news conference started with the 
deputy foreign minister reading the Foreign Ministry statement 
on the U.S. presidential decision to lift the embargo against 
Vietnam. The statement reads in full as follows: 
  On behalf of the Foreign Ministry, I would like to 
announce the statement of the SRV Foreign Ministry regarding the 
U.S. presidential decision to lift the embargo against 
Vietnam. [passage omitted on Le Mai reading the Foreign 
Ministry statement published above] 
  This is followed by a question and answer session. 
  An Australian Radio and Television Company reporter asked: 
When did the Vietnamese Government receive the report on the 
U.S. presidential decision to lift the embargo and by what 
means? And was this decision made by President Bill Clinton or 
the U.S. Government? 
  Deputy Prime Minister Le Mai answered: According to 
U.S. law, the right to lift the embargo rests with the 
president. As for when we were informed of this, I can say that 
we have been widely informed by friends from various countries 
and through different means. I am using the word friends here 
to refer to newsmen. And before President Clinton's decision 
was announced, our [UN] ambassador in New York had met with U.S. 
State Department officials who had informed him of the action. 
He telephoned me about this matter before 0500 this morning, 
that is, before the presidential announcement. 
  A Japanese ASAHI reporter asked about the plan to establish 
the U.S. liaison office in Hanoi and about when the 
establishment of diplomatic offices will be planned. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai said: The U.S. and 
Vietnamese Governments will have a meeting to exchange views on 
stipulations governing the number of diplomatic cadres and 
members of the diplomatic corps as well as on the operating 
procedures for these liaison offices. I do not think that these 
are difficult issues. Therefore, the exchange of liaison offices 
between the two governments will be undertaken soon. 
  A BANGKOK POST reporter asked: What are the follow-up steps 
after the U.S. presidential announcement on lifting the embargo 
against Vietnam and what are the most important issues? 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai said: What we have been 
longing for and will continue to long for is to have the United 
States regard Vietnam as a friend. Our Vietnamese people will 
also regard the American people as friends. 
  The deputy foreign minister also answered many questions 
raised by Vietnamese and foreign reporters on the MIA issue, on 
the question of frozen assets of the two sides, and on the 
relations between Vietnam and other ASEAN countries following 
the lifting of the embargo. 
  A FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC REVIEW reporter asked: Rumor has it 
that Vietnam will give priority to U.S. businessmen to engage in 
a number of investment projects such as those involving oil and 
gas exploitation. Is this true? 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai answered: We welcome 
U.S. businessmen coming to do business in Vietnam, to contribute 
to economic cooperation, and to spur economic development in 
Vietnam in the interests of the two countries. The Vietnamese 
Government hereby assures U.S. businessmen that the Vietnamese 
Government will create equal opportunities for U.S. businessmen 
to compete with those from other countries already in Vietnam. 
Tradition does not allow us to give preferential treatment to 
one country without giving the same treatment to others. I 
think that with its technology and its economic strengths, the 
United States will be able to develop its competitive power if 
it enjoys equal opportunities.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Christopher Kramer in Hanoi] </F>
  [Text] Ads in Hanoi's English-language press are calling 
Vietnamese and foreigners to an end-of-embargo bash at one of 
the city's main hotels. For the locals, admission is free and 
drinks will be on the Americans. American businessman and party 
organizer James Rothwell said it is a small way of thanking the 
Vietnamese for persisting in their efforts to improve relations 
with the U.S. despite the legacy of war. The announcement 
coincides with preparations for the lunar new year and is likely 
to be one of the memorable celebrations in decades.

morning of 3 February, Mr. Joe Anderson, president of the 
Columbia Anderson Construction Corporation, was cordially 
received by Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai.

projects in Vietnam funded by the World Bank, IMF, and the Asian 
Development Bank after the lifting of the trade embargo, which 
public opinion holds can happen in the next few days. He said 
that Columbia Anderson Corporation is one of the leading 
infrastructure construction companies in the United States and 
that U.S.-Vietnam cooperation will be deemed a fine beginning 
for normalizing relations between the two countries. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai welcomed Columbia 
Anderson Corporation's enthusiasm to take part in Vietnamese 
infrastructure projects and reaffirmed Vietnam's policy of 
cooperation with all nations and foreign companies. He said 
that many projects for constructing roads, bridges, and ports in

<F P=106> [Editorial from February 1994 issue of TAP CHI QUOC PHONG </F>
TOAN DAN: "Let's Firmly Grasp the Mid-Term National Party 
Conference Resolution and Make Continued Efforts to Successfully 
Implement the Party-Initiated Renovation Platform"] 
  [Text] The midterm national party conference has summed up 
the results of the implementation of the renovation line since 
the sixth party congress to further clarify the important issues 
during the period of transition to socialism in our country and 
determine major policies and measures to successfully carry out 
the Seventh Party Congress Resolution. 
  The conference took into account the great achievements that 
we have scored two and a half years following the seventh party 
congress and the fine results that we have obtained in the 
framework of the renovation policy adopted by the sixth party 
congress. The delegates maintained that we have overcome the 
socioeconomic crisis to a very important extent. The national 
economy has not only surpassed many difficulties but has also 
reached a considerably high growth rate in many domains and 
begun to develop dynamically. Continued efforts have been made 
to firmly maintain and consolidate political stability, 
strengthen the party's leadership role, enhance the work 
efficiency of state managment agencies, broaden the 
democratization process, and guarantee national defense and 
security capabilities. The people's confidence in the party, 
state, and the renovation undertaking has been consolidated a 
step further. The mass movement to participate in socioeconomic 
development has made many changes for the better. Diplomatic 
relations have been expanded. Our country's position and 
prestige in the world have been enhanced. The international 
situation has been improved and developed to the advantage of 
our people's national construction and defense cause. 
  The above-mentioned outstanding achievements have created 
necessary conditions for our country to gradually shift to a new 
development stage and accelerate the national industrialization 
and modernization program. Realities over the past years 
testify to the correctness of the party's major renovation 
policies and to the appropriateness of its steps. The 
resolutions of the sixth and seventh party congresses have been 
applied to life. 
  While taking into account past achievements, our party has 
also realized weaknesses, shortcomings, and new problems and 
hence has worked out practical policies and solutions to 
successfully implement the Seventh Party Congress Resolution. 
  Lying ahead of our people are great challenges and great 
opportunities. Our country is facing great challenges, namely 
the danger of lagging further behind economically compared with 
many countries in the region and other parts of the world, the 
danger of deviating from the socialist path in case we fail to 
overcome irregularities in direction for implementation, the 
danger posed by corruption and smuggling, and the danger created 
by the hostile forces' peaceful evolution strategy and 
subversion and military invasion schemes. 
  Nonetheless, our country is enjoying favorable conditions. 
Our party has a correct line and displays unity and 
singlemindedness. Our people are hard-working and intelligent, 
maintain a steadfast revolutionary stance, and have confidence 
in the party's leadership. The achievements of the renovation 
undertaking are creating a new source of strength for our 
country to move forward. The development of the 
scientific-technological revolution and our efforts to integrate 
our economic activities in the world economy, broaden our 
cooperative ties with the world community, and contribute to 
peace in the region have created more important sources of 
strength for our nation. 
  Generally speaking, over the past two and a half years, we 
have realized to an important extent the general objectives -- 
especially economic goals -- set by the seventh party congress. 
In the remaining years of the seventh party Central Committee's 
term, it is necessary to motivate our entire party, people, and 
army to make concerted and outstanding efforts to exploit 
favorable opportunities to the full extent, overcome dangers, 
and surpass challenges to successfully make our goals come true. 
  The new economic progress and achievements on the diplomatic 
front require us to pay attention not only to problem-solving 
methods but also to strategically important policies and 
solutions to secure not only more stability but also higher and 
steadier economic growth rate. 
  Therefore, the time has come for us to devote efforts to 
accelerating the national industrialization and modernization 
program a step further, regarding this move as a strategic task 
of primary importance on the economic front. It is necessary to 
adopt uniform measures to implement the multisectorial economic 
development policy. One the one hand, steps must be taken to 
create more favorable conditions for various economic sectors 
and business establishments to develop quickly and effectively. 
On the other hand, continued efforts are needed to strengthen 
and develop the state business sector so it can operate 
effectively, assume a key role in the national economy, and 
serve as a mainstay in directing and assisting other economic 
sectors so they can develop according to socialist orientations. 
  Continued efforts must be made to renovate the economic 
structure, bearing in mind the need to link economic growth with 
social progress and social justice. Corruption constitutes one 
of the dangers that cause the masses to lose their confidence in 
the party and state and that restrain the national renovation 
process. The anticorruption struggle constitutes the most 
burning and most urgent task at present. Resolute and full 
measures must be taken to deal with corruption in the entire 
mechanism as well as from the central down to local and 
grass-roots levels. 
  While discussing measures to accelerate economic 
renovation, the conference asserted the necessity to renovate 
the political system, revamp the party, build a law-governed 
state under the party leadership, strengthen relations between 
the party and people, enhance the all-people unity bloc, and 
strive to improve national defense, security, and diplomatic 
activities. 
  While integrating efforts to build socialism -- our 
forefront 
task -- we must strive to carry out national defense tasks; 
protect our national independence, sovereignty, national 
integrity, security, socialism, and the peaceful life of our 
people. 
  Efforts must be made to firmly grasp and satisfactorily 
carry 
out the common task in national defense and security, firmly 
grasp the guiding concepts set by the party Central Committee's 
Third Plenum. 
  Against the background of the complicated situation in the 
world and the region, our relations with foreign countries have 
increasingly broadened. It is necessary to say that hostile 
forces at home and abroad are attempting to carry out their 
schemes of peaceful evolution, rebellion, and overthrow using 
dangerous and decisive tactics in various forms with the goal of 
eliminating socialism and violating our national independence 
and sovereignty. 
  We must strive to build the all-people national defense and 
security while upholding the revolutionary vigilance of our 
entire party, the armed forces, and people. Efforts must be 
made to strengthen and consolidate the political base and the 
movement to defend national security, build the people's combat 
plan in close association with the all-people national defense 
task, build firm and strong defense zones and people's security 
frontiers, and strengthen defense plan at various key areas, 
thereby firmly defending our national severeignty and 
territorial integrity in the sea, the airspace, and at the 
border areas. We must strive to firmly maintain our internal 
security, detect and curb sabotage activities at home and 
abroad, strengthen state management over social security, and 
oppose crimes and social vices. Efforts must be made to 
renovate the party leadership, enhance the state management over 
national defense and security, improve the quality of agencies 
and cadres responsible for national defense and security tasks, 
and help sectors and echelons to carry out national defense 
tasks in accordance with their functions. The ministries of 
National Defense and Interior must strive to satisfactorily 
carry out their functions and tasks in accordance with their 
authority. 
  Efforts must be made to institutionalize the state laws, 
lines, and policies on strengthening national defense and 
security; perfect the laws on national defense and security and 
on defending the border and sea areas; and supplement and revise 
the law on military obligation and other legal documents. 
Efforts must also be made to promote the enforcement of the 
promulgated laws, integrate efforts to build the people's armed 
forces and the revolutionary, regular, seasoned, and modern army. 
  To triumphantly implement the party resolutions, we must 
strive to enhance our political background, the party leadership 
and its combat capabilities, enhance the working class' 
characteristics and the party's vanguard nature, correctly 
implement the fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism and Ho 
Chi Minh thought on party building task, thereby helping the 
party to strengthen its political, ideological, and 
organizational background. Efforts must be made to review tasks 
and achievements, conduct theoretical studies and researches on 
pressing issues, uphold the spirit of independence, sovereignty, 
and self-reliance; create unanimity within the party on the 
renovation process. We must ensure that all party members have 
a firm political stand and are loyal to the party's ideals and 
the people's just cause. Efforts must be made to criticize and 
overcome deviated concepts and illusions, strive to oppose such 
phenomena as opportunism, rightism, revision, dogmatism, and 
conservatism; heighten vigilance, and struggle against sabotage 
activities of the hostile forces. It our struggle, we must 
adopt a correct concept and measures while refraining from using 
conservative and dogmatic concepts to oppose opportunism and 
revisionism. Reality in the renovation process calls for great 
efforts and correct actions. In practice, however, there are 
shortcomings in the implementation of the renovation process. 
We should strive to promote enthusiasm in implementing this 
process to encourage everyone to strengthen their correct 
concept and develop their intelligence to contribute to building 
the party while hightening vigilance to resolutely oppose 
hostile allegations and criticize erronous concepts. 
  The party's correct lines and resolutions have set new 
orientations. However, the effective implementation of these 
orientations depends on the creativity and intellegence of each 
cadre, party member, echelon, sector, unit, and locality. This 
is because truth is concrete and revolution is creative. 
  Each cadre and party member must strive to firmly grasp the 
party and state's lines and policies. They must base on the 
political task and the reality of their unit and locality to 
study and formulate best measures to fulfill the political 
duties while striving to draw on experiences and contribute to 
developing and triumphantly implementing the party lines in the 
renovation process and in building and defending the socalist 
fatherland.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 3 (YONHAP) -- The U.S. State 
Department acknowledged Thursday that the United States has been 
in contact with North Korea since the last publicly reported 
meeting on Dec. 29 and said that Washington knows where 
Pyongyang stands on the nuclear issue. 
  The official statement by the office of the department 
spokesman is drawing keen interest as it was issued in an 
extremely tense atmosphere that has gripped the U.S. capital 
with regard to the North Korean nuclear question. 
  The statement also came shortly after Billy Graham, visiting 
Pyongyang, delivered a verbal message from U.S. President Bill 
Clinton to North Korean leader Kim Il-song, and the American 
evangelist was reported Thursday to have "urgently relayed" 
Kim's reply to Clinton. 
  Asked whether there has been any contact with North Korea, 
the office of the department spokesman said, "there was no 
meeting since Dec. 29, but there has been communication with 
them." 
  One official at the office stressed that "we know what their 
opinions (on the nuclear issue) are." 
  But "at the present time," he said, "the U.S. Government has 
no plans to contact them to deal with practical problems." 
  On the stalled negotiations between North Korea and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on nuclear 
inspections, the U.S. Government has stated that it will not get 
involved. 
  Meanwhile, Cable Television News Network (CNN) reported 
Thursday that Kim Il-song, during his meeting with Billy Graham, 
expressed hope that the nuclear issue would be resolved. 
  Commenting on Kim Il-song's reply to Clinton, an official at 
the White House said Thursday he has nothing new to report on 
the North Korean nuclear problem. 
  U.S. congressional sources, well informed on affairs at the 
White House, said that members of the National Security Council 
must be analyzing Kim's message. The White House will then need 
time to consult with congressional leaders, they said. 
  In a related development, the State Department confirmed 
Thursday that North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations, 
Pak Kil-yon, and his wife have arrived in Washington from New 
York to attend a national breakfast prayer meeting. 
  U.S. officials who are scheduled to attend the prayer 
meeting, however, have no plans to confer with Pak, department 
officials said. 
  The officials, recalling that Pak attended a similar meeting 
last year, said no significance should be attached to his 
attendance this year.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 4 (YONHAP) -- A senior government 
official, concerned over doubts about Korea-U.S. ties aroused 
by Washington's reported pressure on Seoul to buy Patriot 
missiles, said on Friday there is no change in their basic 
relations. Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said no 
decision has been made on deployment of the anti-missile 
missiles in Korea, though negotiations are under way between the 
two countries. 
  "I understand that the U.S. Government has not yet made a 
final decision on whether the U.S. forces in Korea should be 
equipped with Patriot missiles," he said. "I think the missiles 
will be deployed after Seoul and Washington reach agreement on 
the number of missiles and the date of deployment, considering 
any possible developments in the situation related to North 
Korea's nuclear weapons program." 
  Washington has not pressured Seoul to buy U.S. weapons, the 
official said, commenting on local press reports that the 
Pentagon has asked Korea to buy airborne self-protection jammers 
for the Korean fighter program. 
  A letter reportedly sent by U.S. Defense Secretary-nominee 
William J. Perry to Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae asking Korea 
to buy jammers for the Korean Air Force's F-16 fighters was not 
meant to apply pressure, but to advise that production of the 
jammers has been suspended due to problems with the weapon, he 
said. 
  Only some of the 120 F-16 fighters Korea is to import will 
be 
equipped with the existing model of jammers and the rest with a 
modified new model, he said, adding that the United States has 
not given up the airborne self-protection jammer project despite 
suspending production. 
  "Nobody knows at the moment whether North Korea will allow 
the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect its nuclear 
facilities," the official said, "and the government does not 
want the North Korean nuclear issue to go to the UN Security 
Council and thus to heighten tensions on the Korean peninsula. 
There is no discord between Seoul and Washington over the North 
Korean nuclear issue and the two governments are maintaining 
close cooperation." 
  The opposition Democratic Party is angry about the U.S. 
Government's reported pressure on Korea to buy the jammers. 
  In a statement issued on Friday, party spokesman Pak Chi-won 
said, "I feel indignation at U.S. Defense Secretary-nominee 
William Perry's pressure for Korea to buy defective radar 
jammers through channels outside the usual ones in weapons trade 
between the two countries. The government should make public 
this pressure and seek a new diplomatic approach toward the 
United States, defying such pressure." 
  Perry's letter to Defense Minister Yi will damage the two 
nations' traditional friendship, he said, urging the U.S. 
Government to reflect on whether the letter is tantamount to 
regarding Korea as a disposal site for defective weapons. 
  Washington should "apologize for the letter," he added.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 4 (YONHAP) -- The South Korea-U.S. 
21st Century Council is due to be born on Feb. 17 and 
political, business, academic and press leaders from the two 
countries will hold their first four-day meeting in Washington, 
Korean-side Secretary General Sakong Il said Friday. 
  The basic idea behind the council is for Korean and American 
leaders from all walks of life to get together and discuss 
bilateral cooperation and resolution of problems to achieve 
forward-looking relations in the post-Cold War era, the former 
finance minister told reporters. 
  Sakong, president of the Institute for Global Economics, 
represents Korea, while Fred Bergsten and his Institute for 
International Economics (IIE) will manage U.S. affairs. 
  The Korea Foundation and IIE are to sponsor the 
non-governmental dialogue channel that will exchange expertise 
on a wide range of issues. 
  With about 30 participants from each side, the council will 
meet in Korea and the United States in turn every year behind 
closed doors. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu will make an opening speech at 
the inaugural meeting in Washington. He is among seven senior 
government officials invited along with ambassador to Washington 
Han Sung-su and Assistant Foreign Minister Son Chun-yong. 
  The six politicians attending include Rep. Chong Che-mun, 
chairman of the National Assembly's Foreign Affairs and National 
Unification Committee, and Cho Son-song of the Democratic Party. 
  Lucky-Goldstar Group Chairman Ku Pyong-hoe, Ssangyong Group 
Chairman Kim Sok-won and six other business leaders, 14 eminent 
professors and journalists, plus former Government 
Administration Minister Choe Chang-yun will also take part. 
  Among the participating Americans are Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, 
Laura Tyson, chairman of the Economic Advisers, Robert Fauver, 
special assistant to the president for national security and 
economic policy at the National Security Council, and Winston 
Lord, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific 
affairs, as well as business and press leaders.

<F P=106> [`Exclusive Interview' with Russian Vice Foreign Minister </F>
Aleksandr Panov by HANGUK ILBO Moscow-based correspondent Yi 
Chang-hun, on 3 February -- place not given] 
  [Text] [Yi Chang-hun] Reacting to a rumor about the 
deployment of U.S. Patriot missiles to the ROK, North Korea 
threatened that it will cancel the withholding of its withdrawal 
from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. As a result, 
the situation on the Korean peninsula is becoming alarming. Do 
you think that the U.S.-North Korea talks and talks between the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and North Korea will 
be successful? 
  [Panov] Russia does not think that U.S.-North Korea talks 
and IAEA-North Korea talks have been ruptured. Russia's 
position is that the talks should continue. The North Korean 
nuclear issue should be resolved under the IAEA's control for 
peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. There were some 
successes, although limited, in U.S.-North Korea talks in the 
past. However, the talks were recently suspended and many 
difficult problems are laid on the road toward a third round of 
talks. 
  Russia is discussing the North Korean nuclear problem with 
the United States and China, not to mention the ROK, and there 
are no remarkable differences in the positions of each nation. 
  These nations share the view that North Korea should settle 
nuclear negotiation with the IAEA at an early date and should 
accept the nuclear inspection. 
  [Yi] What is your view on the possibility and prospects for 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula as discussed during 
U.S.-Russia summit and talks between Russian and Chinese foreign 
ministers? 
  [Panov] The only way toward the resolution of 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula at present is to bring 
about concrete fruition in U.S.-North Korea talks and in 
IAEA-North Korea talks. Although talks are very difficult and 
may face a stumbling block, it is important to continue the 
talks in a manner of dialogue. 
  [Yi] What is your opinion on the multilateral security 
cooperation system proposed by the ROK for peace and stability 
on the Korean peninsula? 
  [Panov] Russia basically supports this. This plan is a 
method enabling one to resolve various problems pertaining to 
security on the Korean peninsula, including the North Korean 
nuclear issue. The relevant countries are making efforts to 
achieve this plan. 
  The ROK established diplomatic relations with Russia and 
China. What is left as a pending issue is North Korea's 
normalization of relations with the United States and Japan. If 
the North Korean nuclear problem is solved and normalization of 
relations is achieved, an important progress will be registered 
in efforts to promote security on the Korean peninsula and in 
the Northeast Asia. 
  [Yi] Do you think the Kim Il-song-Kim Chong-il hereditary 
system will proceed smoothly in North Korea? 
  [Panov] I debated on this issue with relevant American and 
ROK figures when I served as Russian Ambassador in Seoul. We 
have drawn a conclusion that it is difficult to predict how the 
North Korean society will change in the future. Since North 
Korea is an extremely closed society and flow of information is 
restricted, analysis and assessment of the practical situation 
on the progress of the hereditary system are very difficult. 
However, international society shares the view that 
stabilization in North Korea's political situation is important. 
  [Yi] When do you think President Kim Yong-sam will visit 
Russia and what are the important agendas? 
  [Panov] Russia is hoping that President Kim will visit 
within this year, and is preparing for this. We believe that 
with President Kim's visit as an occasion, the two nations will 
solve the pending issues including Russia's debt to the ROK, and 
will further promote cooperation in various domains of relations 
between the two countries including domains of politics, 
economy, and culture. 
  [Yi] What is your opinion on the possibility of expanding 
economic cooperation between the two countries and on proper 
means for a solution to Russia's debt to the ROK? 
  [Panov] The amount of trade between the two countries last 
year was $1.5 billion--a 40 percent increase from the previous 
year--and the amount is expected to increase further. We are 
well aware that because of uneasiness in the political situation 
in Russia, ROK businessmen from small and medium-size 
enterprises are reluctant to advance to Russia. However, Russia 
will be stabilized in the future. For example in cooperative 
relations between Russia and the ROK, a ROK firm advanced to 
Russia's Far Eastern district through the introduction of the 
Russian Embassy in the ROK, and established a joint-venture 
textile plant there. This firm has earned a great amount of 
interest by exporting its products to the United States. ROK 
businessmen, who wish to advance to Russia, may inquire of 
Russian Embassy in Seoul about method and procedure of advance. 
Since reshuffle of Russian cabinet members was carried out 
recently, I cannot tell you precisely at this moment about the 
method as to how the Russian Government will resolve the issue 
of its debt to the ROK and of its interest payment. At present, 
relevant officials within the Russian Government are exchanging 
their views on measures for solving the problem.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 4 (YONHAP) -- Most U.N. member nations 
support the idea that the General Assembly should serve as the 
venue for a summit of U.N. members next year, the 50th 
anniversary of the world body's founding, South Korean 
Ambassador to the United Nations Yu Chong-ha said Friday. 
  Yu, here to attend the annual conference of overseas mission 
chiefs, said that the General Assembly may serve as the site for 
a summit of U.N. member nations to revitalize the international 
organization during its 50th year. 
  "In that case, it is highly possible that President Kim 
Yong-sam will attend the summit meeting," he said. 
  Referring to the drawn-out negotiations between North Korea 
and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Yu said 
pessimism on the possibility of settling the problem is growing 
among European countries in the United Nations. 
  "Only China is clearly expressing optimism that the problem 
will be solved in the end. China seems sure that North Korea is 
not trying to rupture its talks with the United States although 
Pyongyang is dragging out its negotiations with the IAEA. China 
firmly believes that it is part of North Korea's negotiating 
strategy." 
  If the problem is referred to the U.N. Security Council, the 
council will take gradual steps following consultations rather 
than imposing sanctions on North Korea immediately, he said. 
  "Although the North Korean nuclear problem is entering a 
crisis stage, enough discussion has taken place in the United 
Nations on the nuclear situation in the world. An international 
consensus has almost been reached on the Complete Nuclear Test 
Ban Treaty (CTBT)," he added.

to participate in the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway 
before the 31 January deadline. Thus, there is a great 
possibility that North Korea will not participate in the Winter 
Olympics to be held from 12 to 27 February. Some people view 
that the failure to present the list of champions is related to 
the political situation in North Korea, while others think that 
North Korea simply did not meet the deadline.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 (YONHAP) -- North Korea, which has 
suffered a serious economic setback in the wake of the collapse 
of former communist regimes in Russia and East European 
countries, hopes to join the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
(APEC), KYODO News Agency quoted an East European source in 
Beijing as saying Thursday. 
  Kim Chong-u, North Korea's vice chairman of External Economy 
Commission, met in January with the East European source who was 
working in Pyongyang at the time and said that military 
expenditures are a heavy burden to North Korea's economic 
development, the source said. Kim's remarks show a change in 
North Korea's economic policy, KYODO said. 
  Kim was quoted as saying that Asia is achieving the most 
rapid economic growth in the world and emphasizing that North 
Korea should strengthen its cooperative relations with Asian 
countries in the economic field. 
  According to KYODO, Kim said that North Korea wants economic 
cooperation with any Asian countries including capitalist 
nations if they are not opposed to North Korean political system 
and that North Korea wants to join the APEC in the end. If the 
military expenditure is reduced, North Korea's economy can be 
revitalized quickly and the North Koreans' living standard will 
be improved, Kim added.

<F P=106> [By Chong In-hwa] </F>
  [Text] It has been learned that North Korea, which is 
facing internal and external adversities, including the nuclear 
issue and economic difficulties, is reducing the scale of 
celebrations for Kim Chong-il's birthday this year compared to 
previous years. 
  According to the National Unification Board [NUB] on 3 
February, North Korea is only holding two events on the occasion 
of Kim Chong-il's upcoming 52d birthday, which is 16 February, 
compared with over 20 domestic and international events held in 
previous years. The source said the scale of the events are 
being reduced and noted that the individual competition of the 
Fourth 16 February Arts Award, which opened on 18 January, is 
being held without the participation of overseas Korean artists. 
  To create a birthday celebration atmosphere, North Korea 
completed a heating system; is carrying out city beautification 
works, including the rearrangement of flower beds in cities and 
cleaning of waterworks and sewage; and issued commemorative 
stamps and postcards. 
  Regarding domestic events, the 16 February Arts Awards and 
the Athletes Games in Mt. Paektu opened on 18 January and 1 
February, respectively. 
  As to international events, a preparatory committee for the 
celebration of Kim Chong-il's birthday was formed in Mozambique 
on 20 January; film shows were held in Tanzania, Nigeria, and 
Ghana during 19 to 21 January; and a study institute of Kim 
Chong-il's works, including the "Azalea in Deep Mountain" and 
"The Seeds," was formed in Japan early January. 
  The NUB analyzes that such a scale of events is considerably 
reduced compared with the 50th birthday in 1992 and the 51st 
birthday last year. 
  In 1992, a "relay of loyalty letter," which had only been 
held on Kim Il-song's birthday, was held for the first time, and 
another relay of similar scale was held in 1993 in connection 
with the Eighth Congress of the League of Socialist Working 
Youth of Korea. 
  Celebration events for Kim Chong-il's birthday began in 
February 1974 and the day was designated a holiday in 1975. The 
celebrations expanded remarkably after Kim Chong-il was elected 
member of the Party's Standing Committee during the Sixth Party 
Congress in October of 1980. 
  On the 40th birthday in 1982, a decree of the Central 
People's Committee designated the whole month of February as 
"Festive February" and upgraded the celebration as an event next 
to the celebration of Kim Il-song's birthday. 
  An NUB official analyzed: "Although there is a point where 
the scale of the birthday celebration is reduced because it is 
not a special birthday that falls on every fifth birthday (a 
multiple of five or 10), however, it is deemed that the change 
reflects a shrinking atmosphere due to economic difficulties and 
the nuclear issue."

  [Text] While some are of the opinion that the ROK should 
obtain recognition for exceptional treatment of inter-Korean 
trade prior to its submission of the final implementation plan 
for Uruguay Round, the government has decided that it need not 
take the initiative of bringing up the matter within the scope 
of the Uruguay Round system, it was learned on 3 February. 
  A relevant government official on that day said, "The 
provisions of the constitution and the North-South Agreement 
define the inter-Korean transactions as transactions within the 
nation, which is an expression of the right to 
self-determination. Therefore, we need not separately obtain an 
official recognition for an exceptional treatment of the 
inter-Korean transactions in the Uruguay Round Treaty. 
  The government official added, "If we apply for the 
recognition for an exceptional treatment, it could be an action 
tantamount to admitting that the inter-Korean transactions are 
in violation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. If 
a third country demands that we pay a price for such 
transactions, we may fall into a position of having to do so."

  [Text] Inchon, Feb. 4 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
stressed here on Friday that local administrations should now 
think and behave not in the bureaucratic manner but in the way 
industries do. During his new year inspection tour here, Kim 
asked Inchon officials to try to bolster the role of Inchon as 
the gateway to the capital area taking advantage of its location 
and such facilities as an international airport being built and 
a modern harbor. 
  The president said that though some people demand 
re-discussion of the Uruguay Round agreement, it is impossible 
to have new Uruguay Round [UR] talks now that the talks have 
already been completed with 117 countries of the world. 
  After his visit to the Inchon City Hall, President Kim 
dropped into the Daewoo Motor Co. in northern Inchon, where he 
took lunch together with 1,200 Daewoo workers at a company 
cafeteria. 
  During his call at the Kyonggi Province administration in 
Suwon, President Kim told Governor Yun Se-tal to be especially 
careful about protecting the sources of the 20 million capital 
zone people's household water. 
  Kim especially suggested that marking poles be placed at all 
waste water displacement ducts so that nearby villagers could 
know the state of waste water disposition by plants. 
  From Suwon, President Kim drove to a high-tech pilot farming 
estate at Chongbuk-myon, Pyongtaek-kun.

<F P=106> [Article by Chin Se-kun: "The Background Behind the U.S. </F>
Lifting of Its Embargo on Vietnam--Choosing Material Gain in 
`Asia's Last Golden Market'"] 
  [Text] The United States entered the road to normalizing 
relations with Vietnam 19 years after it suffered its first 
defeat in war. The U.S. lifting of the embargo on Vietnam must 
have been prompted by economic realities in which the United 
States realized that it can no longer afford to stand aloof by 
Vietnam's golden market. Besides, the Vietnamese authorities 
have shown positive and quick responses toward the solution of 
the issue of U.S. soldiers missing in action (MIA's) in the 
Vietnam war. 
  U.S. economic sanctions on Vietnam have been such an 
agonizing shackle to the United States it may be said that they 
applied economic sanctions on one another. 
  Therefore, while the lifting of the embargo on Vietnam has 
long been envisaged, the decision on lifting the embargo had to 
take into account how sincerely the Vietnamese Government pushed 
ahead with the search for the remains of the 2,239 U.S. MIA's. 
No matter how important the Vietnamese market may be, the 
Clinton administration had to be sensitive to potential 
criticism from the U.S. war veterans association and the 
association of families of MIA's. 
  During his visit to Hanoi toward the end of last month, 
however, (Charles Larson), commander of the U.S. Pacific Forces 
who is charged with the search operation for the U.S. MIA's, 
highly appraised the Vietnamese authorities' efforts in which 
they even offered prize money. Adding that, "If the United 
States normalizes relations with Vietnam, it will facilitate the 
resolution of the MIA issue," he opened a way to lifting the 
embargo. 
  Lawmakers of the U.S. Senate Energy Committee Appropriations 
Subcommittee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee 
Asia-Pacific Subcommittee visited Vietnam. Upon their return 
home, they helped adopt a resolution calling for the lifting of 
the embargo on Vietnam, thus enabling the government to lift the 
embargo. 
  We can better understand the background behind the steps 
taken in order to lift the embargo on Vietnam in view of the 
fact that some 300 U.S. businesses, including such multinational 
enterprises as Citibank, General Electric Co., and Mobile, have 
arrived in Vietnam to begin their brisk marketing activities 
there. 
  Since Vietnam introduced the doi moi renovation policy in 
1986, along the lines of the former Soviet Union's perestroyka 
and glasnost example, it has achieved an economic miracle with 
an annual average economic growth rate of 7 percent from 1991 to 
1993 and an annual inflation rate of 5 percent or lower from its 
previous three-digit inflation rate. Vietnam's potential, no 
doubt, is attractive to U.S. businesses. 
  With the lifting of the embargo, investment and cooperation 
between the two countries is expected to increase in various 
fields, such as in construction, real estate, finance, 
manufacturing, and in petroleum and gas projects. Brisk 
activities are already evident with Mobile's signing last 
December of a contract to develop the (Tan Long) oil field. 
  However, the lifting of the embargo may not smoothly lead to 
the complete normalization of relations, for the United States 
will probably use the issue of normalizing diplomatic relations 
as leverage in securing the initiative in negotiations on 
pending issues, such as the MIA issue, the signing of an 
investment guarantee agreement, the lifting of the freeze on 
U.S. assets in Vietnam, and the human rights issue. 
  Following President Clinton's 4 February announcement of the 
lifting of the embargo, he clarified that "This does not mean we 
are normalizing relations," and this supports the above analysis. 
  Nevertheless, the U.S. lifting of the embargo on Vietnam may 
well have considerable impact on the world, as well as the Asian 
economy, because it is a signal heralding the official rebirth 
of the Vietnamese market, which is called "Asia's last golden 
market" second only to the Chinese market, in the Asian economic 
sphere.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 4 (YONHAP) -- Pollack fishing and supply 
countries will meet in Washington from Feb. 7-11 for the 10th 
multilateral conference on conserving and using pollack 
resources in the Bering Sea, the Foreign Ministry said Friday. 
  Concerned countries in fishing are South Korea, Japan and 
China, and in supply, the United States and Russia. They are 
signatories of a two-year moratorium on pollack fishing in the 
Bering Sea that is due to be lifted this year if resource 
conditions improve. They have been meeting regularly to discuss 
ways of conserving pollack resources in the sea since February 
1991. 
  They agreed on the difficult question of setting catch 
quotas 
at the previous meeting in November last year and are expected 
to touch on drawing up the agreement text and other disputed 
issues.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 4 (YONHAP) -- The government has applied 
to the United Nations for development rights to 300,000 square 
kilometers of seabed in the Pacific Ocean southeast of Hawaii in 
a bid to secure such rights before the U.N. Convention on the 
Law of the Sea goes into effect, a Foreign Ministry official 
said Friday. 
  He said, "After the convention takes effect this coming 
November, those countries which have been registered as pioneer 
investors at the United Nations hold prior rights to developing 
the seabed." 
  The government held an economic ministers' meeting late last 
year to discuss the issue and sent the application to the United 
Nations on Jan. 14. 
  "This application is to secure a mining area in the deep 
seabed development system of advanced nations including Japan 
and France," he said. 
  The area, called "the Clarion Clipperton fracture," holds 
deposits of about 40 billion tons of manganese, about 50 times 
as much as the estimated deposits of the element under the 
continents, and various natural resources including cobalt, 
copper and nickel. 
  The area is between longitude 124 and 138 degrees west and 
between latitude 9 and 18 degrees north, according to Ministry 
officials. 
  The U.N. technical experts' group will review the South 
Korean application and then the U.N. preparation committee is 
expected to register South Korea's rights as a pioneer investor 
around August. 
  South Korea has invested about 45 million U.S. dollars in 
exploring for promising seabed areas over the last 10 years, the 
officials said.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 4 (YONHAP) -- Oil prices are expected 
to be lowered 4-5 percent on Feb. 15, the first downward 
readjustment since the government adopted a system linking 
domestic oil prices to world prices and exchange rates, the 
director general of the Petroleum and Gas Bureau in the Trade, 
Industry and Energy Ministry said on Friday. 
  In January, Korean oil companies imported petroleum for 13 
to 
14 U.S. dollars per barrel, but as the current price is 15 
dollars it is necessary to reduce oil prices by 4 to 5 percent, 
Director General Han Chun-ho said. 
  Han announced on Friday at a seminar sponsored by the Korea 
Petroleum Association that the government would adopt a policy 
linking domestic oil prices to the average price of petroleum 
imported the previous month and to exchange rates. Han added 
that the government will adjust domestic oil prices on the 15th 
day of every month. 
  Under the plan, the government will announce oil prices on 
the 14th of every month through the Korea Petroleum Association 
and apply the new prices on the 15th. The government plans to 
limit its involvement in deciding oil prices, but if a sudden 
international incident arises like the Gulf crisis and prices 
increase sharply, it will intervene in setting prices to prevent 
economic disorder. However, the government will continue to 
control the price of liquefied petroleum gas.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 4 (YONHAP) -- Daewoo Motor Co. is likely 
to gain the second spot in domestic car sales this year, beating 
Kia Motors Corp., industry sources said Friday. 
  Hyundai Motor Co. has led the industry, followed by Kia and 
Daewoo in that order since 1990, but Daewoo caught up with Kia 
in the second half of last year. And Daewoo is expected to keep 
the second place firmly this year, the sources said. 
  Kia and Daewoo have been neck and neck in domestic car sales 
last year, but Daewoo's sales went over Kia's by 3,000 cars in 
November and December. The gap further widened by more than 
8,000 units in January with Daewoo selling 23,735 cars and Kia 
shipping out 15,042. 
  In sales of all kinds of automobiles at home, Daewoo sold 
27,909 units in January and Kia sold 25,062. 
  Kia entered the car market in 1987, selling its Pride model, 
and gained the second rank in 1990, with sales of 140,400 cars, 
relegating Daewoo to third place. 
  Kia has maintained a 25 percent share in the domestic car 
market, but its ratio fell to 19 percent recently. 
  But a Kia official claimed Kia will recover car sales at 
home 
in March, when a modified model of Pride is scheduled to be on 
sale.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 4 (YONHAP) -- Semiconductor exports are 
expected to reach 10.1 billion U.S. dollars this year, or nearly 
11.1 percent of total exports, the Korea Semiconductor Industry 
Association (KSIA) said on Friday. 
  Among exports, semiconductors ranked second after textiles 
in 
1992, but last year semiconductors moved into first at 8.1 
billion dollars with textiles following at 7.32 billion dollars. 
This year semiconductors will hit 10.1 billion dollars and 
textiles 8.2 billion dollars, widening the gap further. 
  Semiconductors' share of total exports has continued to 
expand with the ratio reaching 8.8 percent in 1992, 9.8 percent 
in 1993 and 11.1 percent this year. Semiconductors have also 
gained in the category of electronics exports as the ratio rose 
to 31.6 percent in 1992, 33.1 percent in 1993 and a predicted 
36.1 percent this year. 
  "The world semiconductor market demands more large memory 
chips, so exports of semiconductors will rise more than 20 
percent a year over the coming several years and semiconductors' 
ratio among total exports will jump to 15 percent," a KSIA 
official said. 
  Meanwhile, automobiles ranked ninth among exports in 1992 
with 3.6 percent, but rose to eighth in 1993 with 5.4 percent 
and will soar to seventh this year with 6.0 percent. But 
finished textile goods, which ranked first in 1992 with 9.8 
percent, fell to second in 1993 with 8.7 percent and will drop 
to third this year with 7.6 percent. 
  Among exports this year, finished textile goods will hit 
third at 6.94 billion dollars after semiconductors and textiles, 
followed by home electronic appliances at 6.8 billion dollars, 
steel products at 6.2 billion dollars, electronic products for 
industrial use at 5.6 billion dollars, automobiles at 5.4 
billion dollars, chemical products at 5 billion dollars, ships 
at 4.9 billion dollars and general machinery at 3.8 billion 
dollars.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- Japanese Posts and 
Telecommunications Minister Takenori Kanzaki and U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor failed to bridge a gap in trade 
framework talks on Friday [4 February], a posts ministry 
official said. 
  Kanzaki and Kantor expressed basic stances mainly on two 
areas -- whether to include Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. 
(NTT) in the scope of government procurement and ways to 
increase foreign access to Japan's mobile phone market -- the 
official told a press conference. But he declined to give 
further details, saying both sides agreed to make no comment. 
  After the press conference, the official told KYODO news 
service that the discussion basically "went in parallel" during 
the 60-minute meeting. 
  Neither side yielded on key points in the two areas, though 
Kanzaki and Kantor agreed to continue talks, he said. 
  Subcabinet-level talks are to resume on Monday in 
Washington. 
  Kantor, apparently skeptical about Japanese bureaucrats' 
ability to settle issues, is visiting Japan in a search of a 
breakthrough in the stalled framework talks through direct 
meetings with cabinet ministers. 
  He has already met with the foreign minister, the trade 
minister and the finance minister. But these meetings appeared 
to have no tangible results, casting doubt over the settlement 
of framework issues before the February 11 meeting between 
Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President 
Bill Clinton. 
  The U.S. trade negotiator is to hold a press conference at 2 
P.M. [0500 GMT], wrapping up his trip to Tokyo.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor and Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata 
reconfirmed the need for joint efforts to successfully conclude 
bilateral framework talks and agreed to hold subcabinet-level 
negotiations early next week in Washington, Foreign Ministry 
officials said Friday [4 February]. 
  Kantor and Hata reached the accord during a breakfast 
meeting 
at the ministry's Iikura Guesthouse. It was the second meeting 
between the two men since Kantor arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday. 
  Kantor and Hata agreed that both Japan and the United States 
should strive to solve the "remaining problems" in the trade 
talks before the February 11 summit between Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton in Washington, they 
said. 
  Japanese and U.S. negotiators are supposed to draw up a 
progress report on the framework talks in time for the 
Washington summit, the third round of talks between the two 
leaders since Hosokawa assumed the office of prime minister last 
August, they said. 
  But the two sides remain deadlocked over the definition of 
the "objective criteria" to measure the progress of foreign 
access to Japanese markets. 
  The United States wants to set numerical targets but Japan 
opposes any indicators on the grounds they could lead to managed 
trade. 
  Hata told Kantor he wants the report to balance all three 
main themes of the framework talks -- the macroeconomy, 
microeconomy and global cooperation, the officials said. 
  Although Kantor and Hata did not argue over "objective 
criteria" in the morning talks, they appeared to have shared the 
perception that the "remaining problems" concern the difference 
between Japan and the U.S. over their respective definitions of 
the term, the officials said. 
  The subcabinet-level negotiations will be held in Washington 
as early as next Monday, the officials said. 
  Hata told a press conference that through a series of talks 
between Kantor and high-level Japanese officials this week, 
Japanese and U.S. negotiators were able to confirm their "strong 
intentions" to successfully wrap up the bilateral framework 
talks. 
  Hata said Kantor gave high marks to Japan's efforts to 
introduce measures to stimulate the economy and quoted him as 
saying the developments of the past few days over the 
introduction of a new tax system are "dramatic." 
  Meanwhile, a senior Trade Ministry official also said Friday 
the Japan-U.S. subcabinet-level negotiations will resume in 
Washington as early as next Monday. 
  The official, who declined to be named, said a broad 
agreement has already been reached on government procurement of 
medical and telecommunications equipment, except their numerical 
targets. 
  Japan is willing to reach an accord on automotive issues but 
it has no intention of yielding to the U.S. demand for numerical 
targets for Japanese imports, the official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- The Ministry of Finance (MOF) 
is to compile its draft of the fiscal 1994 budget as scheduled 
before the February 11 meeting between Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington, a senior 
ministry official said Friday [4 February]. 
  "We can't change the schedule... and we will continue our 
utmost efforts" to draft the budget in time for the summit, the 
Budget Bureau official told reporters. 
  His comments came amid confusion in the ministry after the 
coalition parties decided to reconsider the tax plan decided by 
Hosokawa early Thursday. 
  The official said the budget for fiscal 1994, starting April 
1, depends on a report on fiscal 1994 tax reform scheduled to be 
issued by the Tax Commission, an advisory panel to the prime 
minister, early next week. 
  Asked about the third fiscal 1993 supplementary budget, 
which 
is slated for compilation together with the fiscal 1994 budget, 
the official said, "I have no idea...it all depends on the 
stimulus package." The package was to be announced Thursday but 
was delayed due to the political dispute. The supplementary 
budget will finance the package. 
  Meanwhile, other senior ministry officials, who were 
apparently holding emergency meetings, told reporters that the 
ministry is waiting for the coalition to settle the tax issue, 
and voiced uncertainty about what might happen.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Tokyo Asahi Television Network in 
Japanese at 0107 GMT on 30 January, as part of its 100-minute 
political magazine program, "Sunday Project," which begins at 
0100 GMT, carries a 39-minute live interview with Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata, by commentator Soichiro Tawara at the 
Asahi Television studio in Tokyo. 
  The political reform bills passed by the Diet on 29 January 
are the first topic, and Tawara asks Hata, who also heads 
Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), whether he had expected the 
Diet to eventually pass the reform bills. Hata says that there 
was an atmosphere in the Diet and among the public that 
political reforms cannot be put off anymore, and adds that he 
had felt if the lower house speaker requested top leaders of the 
coalition and the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to meet, 
"dialogue (to pass the bills) would start therefrom." 
  Hata says even after the House of Councillors defeated the 
government-proposed bills earlier in the week, he felt confident 
that if the bills were referred to the House of Representatives, 
they could be passed by more than a two-thirds vote. He 
insists, "There was a big current of the times toward that." 
  Tawara asks Hata, "Do you think the heiritsu-sei (combining 
the single-seat district and proportional representation 
systems) is a process of going toward a complete single-seat 
district system or is it the ideal system which should take 
roots?" Hata says the heiritsu-sei can better reflect the 
popular will than a pure single- seat district system. 
  Asked if a general election will be held under the new 
election system by the end of this year, Hata says, "I do not 
think we need to wait until the end of the year," but also 
cautions against being hasty. "The Diet has various problems to 
take care of. On the other hand, political parties need time to 
turn into new parties which will be fitting to the new political 
system," he explains. 
  After some discussions on general economic issues with Hata 
and economists who are present as guests, Tawara brings up the 
Japan- U.S. economic consultations as the next topic. He notes 
the U.S. Government is unhappy about the "bureaucrat-led" 
government of Japan, and cites a senior State Department 
official as saying, "Cannot Hosokawa fire Saito (administrative 
vice minister of finance)?" 
  Hata responds: "America, or Washington, is a small place. If 
someone puts out some information, this spreads to every corner 
quickly. I was recently told the same story by an American who 
was in a very high position. I told him, 'If you start saying 
that sort of thing, let me say this: You have the U.S. Trade 
Representative's Office, the State Department, the Treasury 
Department, the Commerce Department, the Agriculture Department, 
and so forth. The people there all say different things -- they 
speak as they please. Why cannot the people there keep in 
contact with each other better?'" 
  The foreign minister continues: "In the United States, when 
the government changes hands, the people of a new government say 
things which are completely different from what the people of a 
preceding government said." 
  Asked about the numerical targets question, which the U.S. 
Government wants to be set as a way of measuring the progress of 
market liberalization, Hata says he will continue to object to 
that concept, insisting: "I think we must object to it. Let us 
look back on the experience with respect to semiconductors and 
auto parts. No doubt, these products were contributing to the 
trade surplus. So we told the people of those industries that 
it was no time to begin buying other countries' products, and we 
informed the U.S. officials about this. And the officials were 
happy about it. But this was nothing but targets toward which 
efforts would be made." 
  Moderator Tawara says Japan has always been passive in the 
Japan-U.S. economic talks, and asks Hata if the Japanese 
Government will not make any proposals from its side in the 
ongoing talks. Hata replies that Japan has made proposals to 
the U.S. Government already, and says the government told the 
U.S. it should earnestly take on the financial budget deficit 
problem and the country's industries must learn to become more 
competitive. 
  The interview ends at 0146 GMT.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- Foreign share of the 
Japanese insurance market is not subject to disputed "objective 
criteria" being sought by the United States, a senior Finance 
Ministry official said Friday [4 February]. 
  The insurance market worldwide is full of regulations in the 
context of protecting policyholders, and the framework talks in 
this field focus on what is possible to deregulate, the official 
said, requesting anonymity. 
  Checking the progress of deregulation should be the criteria 
which Japan and the U.S. are to set up under the framework 
agreement reached in July, the official said. 
  In this sense, the insurance field is different from, for 
example, the relatively regulation-free automobile field, the 
official said, indicating the framework yardsticks could vary 
for each field. 
  Nevertheless, he criticized the U.S. for demanding 
quantitative benchmarks in the overall framework talks, saying 
that private- sector market share is determined by business 
efforts and strategies. 
  Under the July agreement, the two nations are to establish 
"objective criteria" of a qualitative or quantitative nature, or 
both if appropriate. 
  The official said the two sides would have to make further 
efforts to narrow the gap over the criteria issue at scheduled 
meetings led by subcabinet-level talks next week before the 
February 11 talks between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and 
President Bill Clinton in Washington. 
  An agreement is targeted by then in three priority fields -- 
insurance, automobile and auto parts, and government procurement 
of medical and telecommunications equipment. 
  Asked about the chances of postponing the summit because of 
the political turmoil over the tax issue in Japan, the official 
said the government is determined to keep the schedule. 
  The two leaders are also slated to discuss their respective 
macroeconomic measures as the framework agreement calls for the 
U.S. to take deficit-cutting measures and Japan to boost 
domestic demand to reduce its trade surplus. 
  The deadlocked tax issue is delaying Japan's announcement of 
its stimulus package, including tax cuts, and compilation of the 
fiscal 1994 budget -- the two major actions which Hosokawa plans 
to take before going to Washington. 
  The official said macroeconomic issues are for reporting and 
not for negotiations. The U.S. side recognizes this, too, he 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- Japan is ready to introduce 
an insurance broker system to break the deadlock in its 
insurance negotiations with the United States as part of 
bilateral framework trade talks, government sources said Friday 
[4 February]. 
  They said the government will seek a revision of the 
Insurance Business Law in fiscal 1995 to allow brokers to sell 
policies for different insurance companies. 
  Japan is also willing to liberalize in stages the insurance 
markets for disabilities, diseases and nursing to meet U.S. 
demands in the talks, the sources said. 
  Foreign insurance companies control a major share in those 
fields. 
  But Japan will refuse to introduce numerical targets for 
market opening, the focus of the insurance negotiations as well 
as in other talks, they said. 
  The U.S. is demanding that the foreign share of the Japanese 
insurance market be increased to 10 percent from the present 2 
percent. 
  The sources said negotiations on this issue are likely to 
drag on until the scheduled Japan-U.S. summit in Washington on 
February 11 between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and 
President Bill Clinton.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's government approved an action program Friday [4 
February] to boost the transparency of government procurement 
procedures. 
  The program, drawn up in response to criticism by Japan's 
trading partners and applied to all government purchases, will 
make it easier for foreign companies to bid for such contracts 
through competitive bidding. 
  It is also aimed at improving cooperation and finding better 
ways to handle complaints from foreign companies dissatisfied 
with the procedures. 
  Under the program, foreign companies can make complaints 
about all items procured by the government. The new steps will 
also lower the minimum procurement limit from the current 1 
million special drawing rights (SDRs), worth some 150 million 
yen, to 800,000 SDRs, or 120 million yen. 
  Hosokawa will brief U.S. President Bill Clinton about the 
new 
measures when they meet in Washington on February 11.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- Japan will not participate 
in U.N. peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslavia "at 
present" but will consider studying the possibility on a mid- to 
long-term basis, Foreign Ministry officials said Thursday [3 
February]. 
  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, in announcing Japan's 
contribution to the war-torn region, said humanitarian 
assistance and help in maintaining stability in Macedonia 
through economic and technical cooperation will be stepped up 
instead. 
  The announcement followed weeks of deliberations on Japan's 
possible contribution after the government sent a survey mission 
there in early January. 
  The team, headed by senior Foreign Ministry Official Shunji 
Yanai, visited such areas as Zagreb, Sarajevo and Belgrade. 
  Hata said in the statement that Japan is not considering 
sending personnel to the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR). 
  The ministry officials said Japan will continue studying the 
nation's participation "from a mid- to long-term perspective" 
and closely watch regional developments, the UNPROFOR and the 
peace process. 
  Officials pointed out that although UNPROFOR commander Brig. 
Gen. Saermark Thomsen [spelling of name as received] told the 
mission that he will welcome Japan's participation, the United 
Nations has made no formal request. 
  Once such a request is made, the nation will consider a 
dispatch from a legal viewpoint and then make a policy decision, 
they said. 
  Hata voiced concern in the statement over continuing armed 
conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and the failure of the peace 
process, and strongly urged a solution through negotiations, not 
battles. He added Japan intends to make efforts toward peace. 
  Regarding humanitarian cooperation, Tokyo is considering 
extending between 10 million and 15 million dollars to U.N. 
organizations to help refugees, the officials said. 
  Details, including timing of the disbursement, have yet to 
be 
decided, they said. 
  Tokyo plans to provide facilities, medical goods, food and 
other equipment to help the refugees, they said. 
  Japan will strengthen ties with Macedonia and promote 
personnel exchanges to help develop its economy and improve 
public life in an aim to prevent conflicts from occurring, the 
officials said. 
  Specifically, Japan will send three or four experts to 
Macedonia in spring to study implementation of economic and 
technical cooperation. They will also invite Macedonian 
Government officials in charge of economic cooperation to Japan 
in March, they said. 
  Japan also plans to establish diplomatic ties with Macedonia 
as soon as possible and look into setting up an honorary counsul 
general, and will lift self-restraints on tourists Friday to 
Macedonia, they said. 
  The government will also send a Foreign Ministry official to 
the eight-member conflict prevention mission of the Conference 
on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), the officials said. 
  To tackle the area's problems more effectively, Japan will 
strengthen its embassy in Austria to cover Slovenia, Croatia and 
Macedonia, and promote ties with Albania, which play an 
important role in the stability of the Balkan region, they said. 
  A minister at the Japanese embassy in Austria will become a 
Japanese representative in charge of problems in the region and 
will attend consultations among major nations in Zagreb when 
possible, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- Chinese Vice Premier Zhu 
Rongji will visit Japan from February 23 for about 10 days to 
hold talks with Japanese political and business leaders, Foreign 
Ministry sources said Friday [4 February]. 
  Zhu is expected to meet Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and 
Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata in Tokyo to discuss bilateral 
issues, including ways Japan can support reform and open-door 
policies in China, the sources said. 
  Zhu, who is regarded as a possible successor to Premier Li 
Peng, will also seek increased investment from the Japanese 
private sector in China at meetings with top business leaders. 
  During the 10-day visit, the vice premier also plans to 
visit 
Osaka and Fukuoka, western Japan, to inspect local business 
activities and seek cooperation from private concerns. 
  Both nations agreed on Zhu's visit to Japan when Hata went 
to 
Beijing in January. Zhu's visit to Japan is the first since he 
assumed his post in April 1991.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- Reflecting the frustration 
of German enterprises over Japan's dominance of Asian markets, 
the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Tokyo called for 
more government backing of efforts to meet the Japanese 
challenge in a report released Thursday [3 February]. 
  The "German Asia Concept" report, which was submitted to the 
German Government, urges Bonn to set up a semiofficial "German 
Asia Center" to "bundle the meager German Asia resources" and 
make the German industry competitive in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  With Bonn shouldering 50 percent of a proposed 1 billion 
German mark stock capital, local governments, labor and economic 
organizations, as well as academics, should join forces in 
setting up the center, the paper suggests. 
  German Asia strategies can be successful only "if they take 
into account the Japanese positioning in the Pacific rim," it 
said. 
  To make inroads in Japan-dominated Asian markets, German 
companies must exploit the deficits of Japanese economic 
strategy in Asian countries in transition, the paper states. 
  Japanese business activities block transfer of know-how and 
key technologies, fail to provide for participation of local 
management and do not foster the establishment of independent 
non-Japanese domestic firms, the chamber says in pointing to 
areas where German enterprises could jump in. 
  Germany, in close cooperation with domestic governments, 
must 
offer "comprehensive packages" linking official development aid, 
infrastructure projects, training and know-how transfer to 
prevail over competitor Japan, the paper says. 
  While not excluding cooperation with Japanese networks in 
Asia, the paper advocates link-ups with "non-Japanese networks 
in Asia, first of all the networks of Overseas Chinese." 
  The proposals come after the German Government last fall 
formulated a new Asia concept aimed at greater economic presence 
in the Asia-Pacific area. 
  In its bid to make up lost ground in Asia, the German 
industry ailing under a longstanding recession, high labor costs 
and loss of markets in former communist countries, recently set 
up an Asia- Pacific Committee.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- The chief of Japan's 
largest labor union organization said Thursday [3 February] a 
plan to impose a 7 percent "national welfare tax" on goods and 
services from 1997 is not permissible. 
  Akira Yamagishi, president of the Japanese Trade Union 
Confederation (Rengo), released a statement in response to the 
new tax plan announced by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
earlier in the day. 
  Yamagishi criticized the program as primarily a consumption 
tax hike from the current 3 percent. 
  "I am anxiously concerned that much confusion would take 
place if the government forcibly moves forward with the plan," 
the statement said. 
  He said the de facto consumption tax hike will have an 
adverse effect on pump-priming and it is unclear why the rate 
should be 7 percent. 
  He also said the "National Welfare Tax" is no different from 
the current consumption tax because it will not be used only for 
welfare under Hosokawa's plan. 
  Meanwhile, a top official of Rengo said Thursday the Social 
Democratic Party (SDP) has no choice but to secede from the 
coalition government. 
  The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, warned 
that the fiscal 1994 budget and tax reform bill may not pass 
through the Diet if the SDP leaves the government. In that case 
the Hosokawa administration is likely to collapse, the official 
said. 
  The SDP threatened Thursday to pull its six members from the 
cabinet unless the government amends its tax plan.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's new tax plan received a mixed reaction from Japan's 
major dailies Friday [4 February]. 
  The ASAHI SHIMBUN and MAINICHI SHIMBUN criticized Hosokawa 
over the plan, announced at a news conference in the early hours 
of Thursday. A leading business daily, the NIHON KEIZAI 
SHIMBUN, was also critical, saying the net tax increase from the 
proposal will not help the sluggish economy to recover. 
  But the YOMIURI SHIMBUN threw firm support behind the prime 
minister, and the SANKEI SHIMBUN offered qualified support. 
  In an editorial titled "An Absurd `Decision' by the Prime 
Minister," the opinion-leading ASAHI said, "What on earth is the 
matter?" alluding to "unprecedented turmoil" among the 
government and ruling coalition parties over Hosokawa's tax 
reform plan. 
  The ASAHI asked, "what was the point of Wednesday's talks 
among the coalition and the prime minister's early Thursday news 
conference?" 
  "We cannot understand why the new tax plan was launched so 
abruptly," the ASAHI said, adding that there are too many 
unclear points about the plan. 
  "It cannot be overlooked that not only the Social Democratic 
Party [SDP] but even Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura 
did not know about the new tax plan until just before the 
announcement," it said. 
  The MAINICHI SHIMBUN said Hosokawa failed to respond to 
questions on why the consumption tax must be changed to a 
national welfare tax or why the new indirect tax must be imposed 
in April 1997. 
  "Is it a wise choice to impose the new tax in three years' 
time and set the tax rate at 7 percent," the MAINICHI asked in 
an editorial titled "The Premier's Decision Is Too Abrupt." 
  The largest national daily, the YOMIURI, said it was 
"basically in support" of Hosokawa's tax plan, which it called a 
sweeping tax reform that follows the imposition of the 3 percent 
consumption tax five years ago. 
  The YOMIURI said, "a large income tax cut is necessary to 
escape from the present prolonged recession. But a tax cut 
without a revenue source is nothing more than political 
irresponsibility." 
  It urged the SDP and the main opposition party, the Liberal 
Democratic Party, to help the government enact legislation on 
the tax reform plan based on Hosokawa's announcement. 
  The YOMIURI's editorial said the planned issuance of 
deficit-financing bonds without the backing of revenue sources 
for redemption is very dangerous, noting that the cumulative 
balance of national bond issues at the end of March 1995 will 
reach 200 trillion yen. 
  The NIHON KEIZAI said tax reform must be neutral, but 
Hosokawa's tax plan will produce as much as 3.5 trillion yen of 
net tax increases. 
  It said, "Needless to say, this will sharply offset effects 
from income tax reductions...an advance tax cut will be 
meaningless. Of course, people will not support it." 
  The SANKEI SHIMBUN urged Hosokawa to "conduct tax reform in 
a 
fair manner." 
  Hosokawa's decision basically complies with the direction of 
tax reform that calls for imposing taxes appropriately on 
income, consumption and assets and for taxpayers to share the 
burden fairly. 
  But questions remain, the SANKEI said. "Why could the prime 
minister not propose an increase in the consumption tax rate?" 
  It also questioned why a 9.5 trillion yen tax increase is 
necessary to offset a 6 trillion yen tax cut.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- The ruling coalition parties 
agreed Friday [4 February] to revoke Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's new tax plan and to spend more time discussing tax 
reform, coalition officials said. 
  Representatives of the ruling parties reached the accord as 
they resumed talks Friday to avert a major political crisis that 
emerged after Hosokawa brushed aside opposition from the largest 
governing party, the Social Democratic Party, and announced the 
imposition of a new 7 percent indirect tax on Thursday.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- The government and the ruling 
coalition parties are unlikely to drop the newly announced 7 
percent national welfare tax plan, Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii said Friday [4 February]. 
  Referring to ongoing discussions among coalition party 
leaders, Fujii told reporters after a morning cabinet meeting, 
"it's impossible to settle" (the issue) by dropping the plan 
into "a blank sheet." 
  Brushing aside criticism that the ministry forced Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to decide on the tax plan, Fujii said 
he is "silently watching" the coalition meeting with his 
ministry taking an open-minded or "blank sheet" stance. 
  Fujii also sought to justify Hosokawa's decision by 
stressing 
that the prime minister followed "required procedures" by 
consulting with his advisory panel, an economic policy forum of 
the government and coalition parties and a meeting of party 
leaders. 
  But Fujii reiterated his opposition to changing the new 
national welfare tax into an "objective" tax -- one in which 
the revenues are earmarked for special accounts rather than the 
general account. 
  The new tax would "virtually be an objective tax" because it 
would be implemented in a law stipulating that revenues be for 
welfare purposes. 
  The Social Democratic Party -- the largest party in the 
ruling coalition -- is threatening to quit the cabinet unless 
the government accepts its compromise plan that primarily calls 
for changing the welfare tax to an objective tax. 
  The tax plan decided by Hosokawa calls for adoption of the 7 
percent welfare tax in place of the current 3 percent 
consumption tax in April 1997 to finance tax cuts worth 6 
trillion yen. 
  Fujii reiterated that his ministry's calculation that a 7 
percent tax is needed to finance the tax cuts is "correct." 
  Meanwhile, he said he welcomed a debate about the new tax in 
view of the aging of society, and noted that Hosokawa's 
intentions are in line with the Tax Commission's November report 
calling for a cut in the income tax burden and an improvement in 
consumption taxes to cope with the graying population. 
  He said discussions should not be focused too much on 
economic measures. 
  But in including the tax cuts in the stimulus package to be 
announced shortly, Fujii said the government is taking the 
measures with "confidence" to put the economy on a full-fledged 
recovery path in fiscal 1994, and stable growth in fiscal 1995.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- Manae Kubota, head of the 
Economic Planning Agency (EPA) and also member of the Social 
Democratic Party (SDP), said Friday [4 February] the current 
wrangling over a new tax within the ruling coalition parties is 
heading toward settlement. 
  Negotiations are under way between the SDP, a chief opponent 
of the 7 percent "national welfare tax" proposed by Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, and other groups in Hosokawa's 
seven-party coalition, the EPA director general told a press 
conference. But an early settlement is possible only if the 
coalition parties agree to revise the content of the new tax, 
particularly its purpose and the rate of taxation, Kubota said. 
  Kubota strongly dismissed the new tax as a source of 
financing for the 6 trillion yen income tax cut expected in the 
government's new pump-priming package, branding it "a 
consumption tax increase in disguise." 
  It is "very regrettable" that the prime minister decided to 
introduce the new tax without going through "due process," 
including full discussion among the coalition parties and 
working to achieve a national consensus, Kubota said. 
  She said the EPA is prepared to announce the new economic 
package as soon as the dispute over the new tax is settled. 
  Kubota said the new tax should be modified so that the use 
of 
its proceeds is limited to social welfare-related areas. 
  Hosokawa's new tax does not oblige the government to use the 
proceeds in specific ways even if it is called a welfare tax. 
  She also sought a revision of the tax rate, explaining the 
need for full-fledged discussions to justify a specific rate. 
  As for the timing of the tax's enforcement, she said it 
should be delayed as long as possible in view of the economic 
impact. 
  Kubota said she is prepared to resign as EPA chief if the 
national welfare tax is endorsed as it currently stands. 
  In reference to the 6 trillion yen tax cut, Kubota said the 
scale of the measures should have an impact on the Japanese 
economy, especially on stagnant personal spending.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- Representatives of the ruling 
coalition parties agreed Friday [4 February] to renounce a plan 
to introduce a new indirect tax on sales of goods and services, 
coalition officials said. 
  The agreement came at a time when intra-coalition discord 
over the new "national welfare tax" plan threatened to bring 
down the government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  The accord was reached at a meeting of the leaders of seven 
coalition parties who banded together to mitigate the crisis, 
they said. 
  Ichiro Ozawa, the chief coalition strategist and co-leader 
of 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a key coalition party, told a 
news conference after the meeting, "coalition parties have 
reached the conclusion that they should scrap both plans to 
introduce the new tax and implement a tax cut as they could not 
reconcile their differences over the plans." 
  Ozawa is widely regarded as the behind-the-scenes architect 
of the plan to replace the current 3 percent consumption tax 
with a 7 percent "national welfare tax." 
  The new accord also calls for scrapping a plan to implement 
an income tax cut of 6 trillion yen. The Finance Ministry had 
planned to cover the cut with revenue earned from the proposed 
new tax, the officials said. 
  The ministry's original plan called for issuing 
deficit-financing bonds to fund the tax cut and then redeeming 
the bonds and interest with revenue from the new tax to be 
imposed in three years' time. 
  The crisis emerged when the largest governing party, the 
Social Democratic Party, threatened to quit the coalition in 
protest at Hosokawa's plan to impose the new 7 percent indirect 
tax. 
  SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo told a news conference 
that 
representatives of the ruling coalition parties had not been 
able to reach a conclusion on the tax proposals. 
  "Although the coalition representatives discussed various 
aspects of the matter, we could not reach any agreement," Kubo 
said. 
  "We therefore drew up a tax reduction plan and the new tax 
will be taken back to the drawing board so we can spend more 
time discussing the matter." 
  Kubo revealed that he proposed at the meeting the 
implementation of an income tax and that an alternative source 
of revenue be decided after further discussion. 
  Asked about a possible meeting of heads of coalition 
parties, 
including Hosokawa, he said that if such talks are proposed, the 
SDP will make its decision based on the opinions of the party 
chief, Tomiichi Murayama.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- The head of the government's 
Tax Commission said Friday [4 February] a planned income tax cut 
should be scrapped if it is uncoupled from its companion 
"welfare tax." 
  Told of reports that the tax plan decided early Thursday was 
being sent back to the drawing board because of political 
opposition, Kan Kato, head of the advisory panel to the prime 
minister, told reporters the plan's 6 trillion yen in income and 
resident's tax cuts must remain linked to the welfare tax. 
  At a regular press conference, Kato praised Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa's decision to adopt the plan, which links the 
tax cuts, retroactive to January 1, with changing the 3 percent 
consumption tax to a 7 percent welfare tax in 1997. 
  He said he and others on the panel thought that "political 
collateral" -- promises that the tax cuts would be paid for 
later -- was not enough and that the funding must be made clear 
along with the tax cut. The tax cuts require "panel 
collateral," he said. 
  Hosokawa has vowed in the past to respect recommendations of 
the Tax Commission.

  Hosokawa offered the apology at a meeting of cabinet 
ministers following the day's regular cabinet session, the

  On Friday, leaders of the coalition parties agreed to

  In a meeting with Hiroyuki Sonoda, a senior official of the 
alliance between the Japan New Party (JNP) and Sakigake 
(Harbinger), Hosokawa expressed the hope that the coalition 
parties will discuss the tax reform plan, the officials said. 
Hosokawa heads the JNP, while Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi 
Takemura leads Sakigake. Both parties are in the ruling 
coalition.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- The main opposition party, 
the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), accused Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa and the ruling coalition Friday [4 February] 
of being "irresponsible" over the scrapping of a fresh tax plan 
the premier announced Thursday. 
  LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori said, "It's an 
irresponsible way to do things. The cabinet should take much of 
the blame." 
  Mori told reporters that the coalition partners should have 
consolidated their opinions before the announcement because the 
tax system deeply affects the Japanese people. 
  "If it was decision-making on international relations, it 
might have brought about a major disaster," Mori said. 
  Earlier in the day, leaders of the coalition parties agreed 
to renounce the tax plan Hosokawa announced at an early Thursday 
morning news conference. It called for abolishing the 3 percent 
consumption tax and instead introducing a new indirect tax on

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa insisted Friday [4 February] on a 7 percent indirect 
tax despite a coalition agreement earlier in the day to scrap 
his proposal to impose a "national welfare tax." 
  Hosokawa argued for the 7 percent rate at a meeting with 
Japanese reporters at his official residence. 
  Hosokawa said the 7 percent rate for the indirect tax is 
necessary to finance tax cuts of 6 trillion yen the government 
was planning to implement as part of a new comprehensive 
pump-priming package. 
  He said the revenue-boosting measure is indispensable to 
enable his administration to compile the fiscal 1994 state 
budget. 
  "I want coalition party leaders to come up with the right 
answer as quickly as possible so the government can compile the 
state budget according to its originally scheduled timing," he 
said. 
  The premier's statement came a few hours after the leaders 
of 
the coalition announced they had renounced his plan to introduce 
the new 7 percent tax and implement a tax cut of 6 trillion yen. 
  The coalition leaders decided to give up the tax program to 
avert a political crisis which was threatening to scuttle the 
seven-party coalition government. 
  The Social Democratic Party, the biggest in the alliance, 
threatened to quit the coalition unless it abandoned the plan 
which the party said would amount to a de facto doubling of the 
current 3 percent consumption tax. 
  Earlier on Friday, Hosokawa apologized for failing to ensure 
"sufficient contact among the government and ruling coalition 
parties" before announcing a package of tax cuts and increases, 
coalition officials said. 
  Hosokawa offered the apology at a meeting of cabinet 
ministers following the day's regular cabinet session, the

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- The ruling coalition 
parties on Friday [4 February] revoked Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's tax program that threw Japan's political world into 
chaos Thursday and threatened the near collapse of the 
six-month-old governing alliance. 
  Ichiro Ozawa, the chief coalition strategist and co-leader 
of 
Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), a key coalition party, made the 
announcement at a news conference following morning talks among 
leaders of the ruling coalition parties. 
  "Coalition parties have reached the conclusion that they 
should scrap both plans to introduce the new tax and implement a 
tax cut as they could not reconcile their differences over the 
plans," Ozawa said. 
  Ozawa is widely regarded as the behind-the-scenes architect 
of the tax package which Hosokawa unveiled at an early Thursday 
news conference. 
  The main opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] rapped 
the 
coalition government for revoking both plans to introduce the 
new tax and to implement a tax cut. 
  LDP secretary general Yoshiro Mori said, "they used an 
irresponsible strategy and the cabinet should take much of the 
blame." 
  Hosokawa's package calls for a 6 trillion yen reduction in 
income tax and for replacing the current 3 percent consumption 
tax with a 7 percent "national welfare tax." The Finance 
Ministry had planned to cover the tax cut with revenue earned 
from the proposed new tax, the officials said. 
  The Social Democratic Party, the largest among the seven 
ruling parties, renewed its threat to withdraw the party's six 
cabinet ministers from the Hosokawa administration if the 
coalition came up again with a plan to increase taxes. 
  Emerging from the talks with the coalition partners, SDP 
Secretary General Wataru Kubo said, "although the coalition 
representatives discussed various aspects of the matter, we 
could not reach any agreement." 
  "We therefore concluded that the tax cut and increase plan 
will be taken back to the drawing board so we can spend more 
time for discussion of the matter," he said. 
  Following the announcement of the scrapping of the tax plan, 
Hosokawa pleaded with coalition partners to resume discussion on 
the issue of tax reform, officials said. 
  Hiroyuki Sonoda, a senior legislator of Sakigake 
(Harbinger), 
one of the seven ruling parties, quoted Hosokawa as saying, "I 
want coalition parties to revive discussions" over the tax plan. 
  Officials said the coalition leaders had to make the 
decision 
in order to alleviate intracoalition discord over the new 7 
percent "National Welfare Tax," as the SDP threatened to quit 
the coalition in protest at the new tax proposal. 
  The Finance Ministry's original plan called for issuing 
deficit-financing bonds to fund the tax cut and then redeeming 
the bonds and interest with revenue from the new tax to be 
imposed in three years' time. 
  However, a well-placed government source suggested that the 
Hosokawa administration will have to quickly engineer concrete 
tax cut measures to achieve the 15 trillion yen comprehensive 
pump-priming package which Hosokawa will cite at a February 11 
summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington. 
  The Clinton administration has been urging Japan to take 
drastic economic stimulus measures to pull the slumbering 
Japanese economy out of recession, revive consumer spending and 
thereby pare back Japan's huge trade surplus with the United 
States. 
  The Japanese Government was reportedly compiling the 15 
trillion yen economic stimulus package featuring the 6 trillion 
yen tax cut measure as well as increased public works spending 
in the face of a veiled U.S. threat to invoke its super 301 
retaliatory trade provision. 
  Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Hatoyama, reacting to 
the news of the decision to revoke the new tax plan, suggested 
to reporters the Hosokawa administration has not yet given up 
the hope of compiling the comprehensive pump-primer package 
before Hosokawa's departure for the United States on February 10. 
  Hatoyama said, "We still have Friday and Saturday" to hammer 
out an intracoalition accord to compile a revenue-securing 
measure that would enable the government to compile the package. 
  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told reporters, "we are 
trying 
to secure an agreement to set up an inter-party consultative 
panel on tax measures, while the issue of how to raise revenue 
to finance a tax cut should be taken back to the drawing board." 
  "If we continued to spurn the coalition's tax proposal, it 
could lead the coalition to collapse. We have to make a policy 
choice by considering where the SDP could offer certain 
concessions without splitting the coalition," Murayama said. He 
did not elaborate on the possible compromise deal. 
  Health and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi, leader of another 
coalition partner, the Democratic Socialist Party, told 
reporters he believes the coalition should reform its method of 
producing and proposing a new policy measure. 
  "My Welfare Ministry is in charge of welfare affairs. It is 
strange for the National Welfare Tax proposal to have surfaced 
without any advance consultations with the ministry" Ouchi said. 
  The SDP has blasted the new tax plan as a ploy to force the 
nation to accept a de facto doubling of the current 3 percent 
consumption tax rate by merely renaming it as a "welfare tax." 
  The SDP has argued that the coalition should insert into the 
new tax legislation wording that would ensure all the fresh 
revenue from the new tax be used solely for welfare purposes. 
  But the Finance Ministry has resisted the SDP demand, saying 
that such a provision would tie the hands of the government in 
funneling the revenue to fund various policy measures. 
  The SDP, which has insisted on the abolition of the 
consumption tax, boosted its parliamentary strength in a 1989 
House of Councillors election shortly after then Prime Minister 
Noboru Takeshita enraged voters with the consumption tax he 
introduced.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- The coalition government 
thinks Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's tax plan is 
politically frozen, the top government spokesman said Friday [4 
February]. 
  Takemura made the comment at an evening news conference 
following the announcement by leaders of ruling coalition 
parties to revoke Hosokawa's decision Thursday to impose a 7 
percent indirect tax in April 1997. 
  Takemura said the coalition aims to reach a decision by 
Monday at the latest on tax cuts, which are part of a fresh 15 
trillion yen pump-priming package. 
  He said there will be no change for schedules to compile the 
state budget for fiscal 1994, noting the Finance Ministry will 
unveil a budget plan February 10 and the cabinet will adopt the 
final budget plan February 15.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- Health and Welfare Minister 
Keigo Ouchi said Friday [4 February] the cabinet of Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has scored a "minus point" because 
the ruling coalition renounced a package of tax cuts and 
increases. 
  Ouchi, chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), 
told 
reporters the cabinet "must submit itself to criticism." But 
Ouchi said "the minus point is not so large" as to justify talk 
of whether or not the prime minister should take political 
responsibility," a term used to imply resignation. 
  Management and Coordination Agency Director General Koshiro 
Ishida, who heads Komeito, said discussions were insufficient 
before deciding the tax plan. 
  Ishida indicated he does not support a proposal to use the 7 
percent "National Welfare Tax" solely for welfare, saying that 
it is difficult to limit its use because revenues from the 
proposed tax are large. He said welfare concerns every aspect 
of national life from medical treatment to pensions and housing. 
  Science and Technology Agency Director General Satsuki Eda 
told a news conference that now is the time to tackle the 
problem of how to boost the national economy but cautioned 
against seeking a solution on tax reform in a hasty manner. 
  Eda, leader of a minor political party, the United Social 
Democratic Party (USDP), declined to comment on reports that 
some party members have called for Eda's resignation as a 
cabinet member. 
  Eda said, "the prime minister's proposal is crudely put as a 
decision but is worth considering." 
  Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata said 
he will take the blame for a major political crisis that stemmed 
from Hosokawa's tax reform plan announcement. 
  Hata said the Finance Ministry only helped the coalition 
work 
out the new tax plan. 
  In an early Thursday morning news conference, Hosokawa 
announced a decision to cut 6 trillion yen in taxes. As a 
revenue source, the prime minister proposed scrapping the 
present 3 percent consumption tax and instead imposing a 7 
percent "National Welfare Tax" in April 1997. 
  Hosokawa's announcement angered the Social Democratic Party, 
the largest of the seven parties in the coalition, which 
threatened to quit the alliance, throwing the political world 
into turmoil. 
  On Friday, leaders of the coalition parties announced they 
would renounce the tax plan to avert a possible collapse of the 
Hosokawa cabinet.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa on Friday [4 February] called for a revival of his plan 
to impose a 7 percent tax on goods and services, ditched hours 
earlier by his ruling coalition. 
  Hosokawa told reporters at his official residence that he 
believes the coalition leaders merely "froze" the tax program 
"for political reasons," rather than having killed it with 
Friday's seven-party agreement. 
  "I would only seek the same thing which I appealed to the 
public to accept, if I appeared again" in a televised news 
conference, Hosokawa said. 
  In a predawn press conference Thursday, Hosokawa surprised 
the people and even members of his coalition partners with his 
announcement of the plan to create a 7 percent "National Welfare 
Tax," starting in April 1997. 
  At Friday's press briefing, Hosokawa said the tax is 
necessary to finance a 10-year welfare program for the elderly, 
raise pensions in tandem with annual price rises, and redeem 
additional deficit- servicing bonds expected to be floated from 
fiscal 1994. 
  The new tax, whose mechanism is virtually similar to that of 
the current 3 percent consumption tax, would be slapped on sales 
of most goods and services in Japan. 
  Hosokawa cited budgetary estimates of expenditures to be 
financed by the tax, which were unveiled by the Finance Ministry 
on Thursday. 
  Hosokawa said his tax program would fund an outlay of 800 
billion yen to finance the welfare program, 1.3 trillion yen to 
cover an increase in government procurement-related spending as 
a result of the tax, as well as 1.4 trillion yen for redeeming 
additional deficit-servicing bonds. 
  Under the overall tax plan of 9.5 trillion yen, these 
outlays 
would be tacked onto a total of 6 trillion yen in income and 
corporate tax cuts, of which national and local income tax would 
account for 5.3 trillion yen, he said. 
  Ichiro Ozawa, a chief coalition strategist and co-leader of 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], told a news conference earlier 
Friday that the coalition parties "have reached the conclusion 
that they should scrap both plans to introduce the new tax and 
implement a tax cut as they could not reconcile their 
differences over the plans." 
  Ozawa, widely regarded as a main architect of the tax 
proposal, made the announcement after emerging from the meeting 
of coalition leaders. 
  Hosokawa also told reporters the revenue-boosting measure is 
indispensable to enable his administration to compile the fiscal 
1994 state budget. 
  "I want coalition party leaders to come up with the right 
answer as quickly as possible so the government can compile the 
state budget according to its original schedule," he said. 
  Coalition officials said the leaders had to give up the tax 
program to avert a political crisis which was threatening to 
scuttle the coalition government. 
  The Social Democratic Party (SDP), the biggest party in the 
alliance, threatened to quit the coalition unless Hosokawa 
abandoned the plan, which the SDP said would amount to a de 
facto more than doubling of the consumption tax.

  [Excerpts] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- Three top leaders of 
the main opposition party slammed Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa on Friday [4 February] for his "irresponsibility" over 
the rescinding of a planned income tax cut and new "welfare tax" 
unveiled by the premier Thursday. 
  Yohei Kono, president of the former ruling Liberal 
Democratic 
Party (LDP), told reporters that the process of scrapping the 
tax plan shows the Hosokawa administration is controlled by a 
few members of the coalition. 
  Ichiro Ozawa, co-leader of the Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party] and a chief strategist in the coalition, and Yuichi 
Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito, reportedly played key 
roles in drawing up the plan. 
  Kono blasted the irresponsible array of the cabinet, saying, 
"if it is not Hosokawa who decided the plan, than who heads the 
cabinet?" 
  He said the turmoil could deepen the public's distrust in 
politics. [passage omitted] 
  LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori said in a party meeting 
in 
Yokohama, "what is going on with the responsibility of Hosokawa? 
(the government and the ruling coalition parties) are in a state 
of anarchy with no political responsibility." 
  Mori, meanwhile, urged the government to raise the 
envisioned 
tax cuts worth 6 trillion yen, including income and residential 
tax reductions, saying "I'm skeptical about whether the 6 
trillion yen will be effective (in boosting the sluggish 
economy)." 
  He also insisted on separating cuts and increases in taxes, 
saying that financial resources to cover tax reductions should 
be considered after the economy begins to recover. 
  On an idea calling on the LDP to join the coalition, Mori 
said "the LDP will not move to join (the framework of the 
coalition)." 
  Earlier, the LDP Secretary General told reporters that the 
coalition partners should have consolidated their opinions 
before the announcement because the system deeply affects the 
people. 
  The new tax plan was part of the government's expected 
pump-priming package worth 15 trillion yen designed to lift the 
economy out of the worst recession in the postwar era. 
  Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the LDP's Policy Affaris 
Research Council, also lashed out at Hosokawa, saying, "how is 
Hosokawa feeling about the significance and the responsibility 
of the remarks (he) made at the press conference?" 
  "I will pursue (this matter) in the Diet," he said at a 
press 
conference in Miyazaki, western Japan. 
  Hashimoto, a former finance minister, also expressed concern 
that the scrapping of the new indirect tax plan could affect the 
summit talks between Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton 
next week. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- Top policy-making officials 
of the ruling coalition agreed in a meeting Friday [4 February] 
to postpone a final decision on an outline of fiscal 1994 tax 
reforms until Wednesday if agreement is delayed on tax cuts and 
ways of financing them, coalition officials said. 
  The decision had earlier been expected on Tuesday. 
  Finance Ministry officials who were present at the meeting 
said the ministry will be still able to publish its budget draft 
for the year beginning next April 1 even if the decision is 
delayed until Wednesday.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- The coalition government of 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has now postponed the 
announcement of the new economic stimulus package until Monday, 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said Friday [4 
February]. 
  "The economic stimulus package cannot be compiled without

told an evening news conference. 
  The government was originally scheduled to unveil Thursday 
evening an economic package featuring a 6 trillion yen tax cut. 
[new graf] 
  Earlier Friday, coalition leaders agreed to start anew 
debate 
over Hosokawa's proposal Thursday to introduce a new 7 percent 
indirect tax while carrying out the tax cut. 
  Hosokawa asked the coalition leaders to try once again to 
reach consensus on the new tax plan.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- Business leaders expressed 
concern Friday [4 February] over a delay in finalizing a 
much-awaited package of stimulative measures aimed at buoying 
the stagnant economy. 
  The government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and 
ruling 
coalition parties had planned to adopt the package this week, 
but political turmoil over tax issues has forced a delay at 
least until Monday. 
  Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the powerful Federation of 
Economic Organizations (Keidanren), said, "there is no time to 
spare in implementing a comprehensive stimulative package, 
including a major income tax cut." 
  Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of 
Employers Associations (Nikkeiren), said "economic recovery will 
come later than expected." 
  He said Hosokawa may come under strong pressure from the 
United States to implement an income tax cut when he meets 
President Bill Clinton in Washington on February 11. 
  "The most urgent task facing the government and coalition 
parties is to get the weak economy back in good shape as soon as 
possible while keeping political reforms from retreating any 
further," Nagano said. 
  In this connection, Tadahiro Sekimoto, president of 
electronics giant NEC Corp., called on Hosokawa to show strong 
leadership.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- Two ruling parliamentary 
groups in the House of Councillors merged Friday [4 February] 
into a 37-member force and reported the merger to the upper 
house Secretariat, members said. The new group named 
"Shin-Ryokufu-Kai," or "New" Ryokufu-Kai, is the third largest 
parliamentary group in the upper house after the opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP), the largest party in the ruling coalition. 
  A 27-member upper house alliance of the Japan New Party 
(JNP), Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and the Democratic Reform 
Party (DRP) got together with an 11-member group comprising the 
Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and the Sports Peace Party. 
Eiji Suzuki, a member of the 11-member group, did not join the 
new team and became independent, the members said. 
  The new alliance will hold all-member discussions every 
week, 
they said. 
  However, the group will not bind members by its decisions, 
said Kanpei Matsuo of Shinseito who heads the alliance. He said 
the team was named after "Ryokufu-Kai," a defunct powerful upper 
house group of independent legislators which existed shortly 
after the end of World War II. 
  The new group will ask upper house SDP and Komeito members 
to 
join in, with a view to supporting the coalition government, the 
members said. 
  In the 252-seat upper house, the LDP now has 95 seats, the 
SDP 71, Shin-Ryokufu-Kai 37, Komeito 24, the Japanese Communist 
Party 11, the Niin Club five and independents nine.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- A group of 23 private 
individuals filed a complaint with public prosecutors against 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] co-leader Ichiro Ozawa on Friday 
[4 February], accusing him of illegally receiving a 5 million 
yen political donation in December 1992. 
  The group also lodged accusations with the Tokyo District 
Public Prosecutors Office against four accountants of Ozawa's 
fund-raising bodies and a former executive of a major 
construction firm who allegedly passed on the 5 million yen. 
  The group's written complaint accused Ozawa and the other 
five of violating the Political Funds Control Law. 
  Ozawa, former secretary general of the Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP), has denied allegations he regularly received 
illegal donations from the major general contractor over the 
past few years, including the 5 million yen in December 1992. 
  But Shinji Kiyoyama, 67, a senior vice president of Kajima 
Corp., has acknowledged to prosecutors that Kajima gave Ozawa 
donations of 5 million yen twice a year -- in midsummer and at 
the year-end -- for two or three years, prosecution sources have 
said. 
  Kiyoyama is under arrest on suspicion of giving a 20 million 
yen bribe to then Ibaraki Gov. Fujio Takeuchi to get favorable 
treatment for Kajima in bids for prefectural public works 
projects. 
  According to the plea of complaint, Ozawa and the four 
accountants did not list the scandal-plagued Kajima Corp. in his 
reports of spending and revenues on political donations despite 
receiving more than 1 million yen in donations from the firm. 
  The Political Funds Control Law prohibits politicians from 
receiving more than 1.5 million yen a year from any single 
individual or corporation and also requires politicians to 
report the names of donors of 1 million yen or more at any one 
time. 
  Early last November, Ozawa told reporters he accepted the 5 
million yen from Kajima as a legal political donation and denied 
allegations he regularly received illegal contributions from the 
leading contractor over the past few years. 
  Several of his political organizations received money from 
Kajima and formally issued receipts for the money, Ozawa said.

KYODO -- Japan's first fully domestically developed rocket, the 
H-2, blasted off successfully on its maiden flight Friday [4 
February], putting an unmanned prototype space shuttle into 
circular orbit, the state space agency said. 
  After one pass around the earth at an altitude of about 450 
kilometers, the experimental space shuttle code-named Orex 
splashed down as planned two hours 10 minutes later about 460 
kilometers south of Christmas Island in the mid-Pacific, said 
officials of the National Space Development Agency (NASDA). 
  The mission has put Japan among the leading nations in 
rocket 
technology, opening up prospects for potential commercial 
satellite launches, NASDA officials said. 
  Engineers at Tanegashima Space Center in southern Japan 
cheered when the rocket ignited and took off from the center's 
launch pad at 7:20 A.M. [2220 GMT], leaving a thick orange 
condensation trail in the morning sky. 
  The lift-off was delayed by 20 minutes because a ship 
unexpectedly entered the area where the H-2's solid rocket 
boosters were to plunge down after the launch. 
  Originally the lift-off had been set for Tuesday but was 
postponed until Friday because of bad weather and a faulty air 
duct that came loose. 
  The rocket released the 860-kilogram cone-shaped Orex from 
inside the payload fairing at the top part of the rocket some 
six minutes after the launch. 
  Fourteen minutes later, the H-2 delivered a 2.4-ton 
satellite, called vehicle evaluation payload (VEP), into a 
high-altitude orbit, where it will circle the earth for four 
days to confirm launch performance. 
  On reentering the atmosphere, Orex conducted various tests 
that will help in research and development of a future unmanned 
space shuttle called Hope, expected to be launched around 2005. 
  Compared with its predecessors, which contained a number of 
foreign-made components, the two-stage H-2 rocket has a bigger 
engine and can carry a bigger payload. 
  Due to an improved fuel tank and fairing, the H-2 is only 
half as heavy as the European-developed Ariane-4 rocket, but 
reportedly equals its capability. 
  The 50-meter-long H-2 can deliver a single two-ton satellite 
into geostationary orbit. 
  For the first stage the H-2 uses a newly developed liquid- 
hydrogen rocket engine called LE-7, which is said to be more 
powerful than previous versions, and is claimed to rival the 
engine of the U.S. space shuttle. 
  The H-2 has so far cost some 270 billion yen to develop. 
Preliminary testing began in 1985, and NASDA started actual 
development testing in 1986. 
  The initial goal of launching the first H-2 rocket in early 
1991 was revised when scientists said it required more advanced 
technology. 
  The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
(NASA) 
has said it will use an H-2 to launch a satellite to measure 
rainfall in the tropics in 1997. 
  At present the high cost of the H-2, which at 19 billion yen 
-- including launching fees -- is five times higher than for a 
satellite launch by Ariane, are the obstacle to widespread use 
of the rocket in commercial projects, officials said. 
  To increase Japan's competitiveness in the international 
rocket market production costs must be substantially reduced, 
they said.

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Isao Ikariya: "H-2 Rocket Launch Heralds </F>
Japan's Aerospace Independence"] 
  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- The success of the H-2 
rocket's maiden flight Friday [4 February] ushers in an era of 
Japan's independence in aerospace, paving the way for the 
nation's entry into the commercial satellite launching business. 
  The 50-meter, two-stage rocket is the first major space 
vehicle developed and manufactured entirely in Japan, freeing 
Japan's aerospace industry after decades of heavy dependence on 
U.S. technology. 
  Previous Japanese rockets used U.S. technology under a 
licensing agreement that bans launches of third-nation 
satellites. 
  The orange and yellow H-2 rocket blasted off early Friday at 
Tanegashima Space Center in southwestern Japan after a three-day 
delay due to bad weather and technical snags. 
  As scheduled, the rocket released a dish-shaped payload 
called the Orbital Reentry Experiment (OREX) about 15 minutes 
after blastoff, successfully having it reenter the atmosphere to 
gather data for developing a Japanese version of the U.S. space 
shuttle. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa issued a statement hailing 
the successful launch of the H-2 rocket as "creating new 
prospects for the 21th century." 
  Tomifumi Godai, chief of the National Space Development 
Agency of Japan (NASDA), said the successful liftoff of the H-2 
rocket put an end to "a quarter-century approach run" to catch 
up with the United States and other aerospace leaders. 
  "Now we mark the beginning of activity to lead the world," 
Godai told a press conference. 
  Masato Yamano, NASDA director in charge of the launch of the 
H-2 rocket, described the two-hour space mission as a great step 
forward toward space development. 
  "The successful launch of the H-2 rocket demonstrates the 
practicality of our technologies developed to date and is a 
great achievement toward developing a transport system to 
promote diversified space activities," Yamano said. 
  The H-2 rocket, Japan's first rocket capable of launching 
large communications and earth observation satellites, was 
developed by Rocket Systems Corp. (RSC), a consortium of more 
than 70 companies led by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., at a 
cost of 270 billion yen. 
  The technological centerpiece of the rocket is the 
first-stage engine, the LE7, modeled on the U.S. space shuttle 
engine and considered one of the world's most sophisticated 
rocket power drives. 
  But due to the complexity of the LE7 engine that runs on 
liquid hydrogen and oxygen, the first launch of the H-2 rocket 
was two years behind schedule as a series of accidents delayed 
the project, including an explosion in 1991 that killed an 
engineer and a fuel leak in 1992 that burned an engine in test 
running. 
  People involved in the H-2 rocket development said the 
launch 
was a complete success, but acknowledged there are many problems 
to be overcome before Japan can get a foothold in the 
satellite-launching business. 
  The biggest problem is to make the H-2 competitive in the 
international satellite-launching market, currently dominated by 
the European consortium Arianespace and General Dynamics Corp. 
of the United States. 
  The H-2 rocket costs some 19 billion yen, including 
launching 
expenses, which makes it 1.5 to two times more expensive than 
its U.S. and European counterparts. 
  But NASDA and RSC officials are looking to make up for the 
price disadvantage with a reputation for reliability. 
  "We could offset such a price gap if we increase 
reliability," an RSC official said. 
  There are still nontechnical hurdles, such as a pact with 
fishermen around Tanegashima Island. 
  The agreement allows launches only in the January-February 
and August-September periods, because the launches disrupt 
fishing activity, meaning only two rockets can be launched a 
year. 
  "I wonder if we could have rocket launches in better seasons 
such as spring and autumn," one NASDA official said.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of interview with Arifin Siregar, ambassador to </F>
the United States, by TEMPO correspondent Bambang Harymurti in 
Washington; date not given] 
  [Text] [Harymurti] How are current Indonesia-U.S. 
relations? 
  [Siregar] You know that relations between Indonesia and the 
United States in the past few years have been quite good. In 
politics, Indonesia has been active in solving the Cambodian 
problem, and this has benefited the United States. The 
Indonesian and U.S. Governments have also worked together well 
in international forums, such as in the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation [APEC] and the Uruguay Round meetings. 
  [Harymurti] Did Indonesia and the United States always hold 
similar views during the Uruguay Round talks? 
  [Siregar] Of course, there are always differences of 
opinion, but we do not belong to the group of countries 
obstructing the Uruguay Round talks. In economic ties, our 
bilateral trade grows steadily. Our exports last year stood at 
U.S. $4.5 billion and our imports at U.S. $3.5 billion, while 
U.S. exports to Indonesia stood at U.S. $4.3 billion. 
  [Harymurti] So, bilateral trade is more or less balanced. 
  [Siregar] That is right. From the Indonesian point of view, 
the U.S. market has great potential. U.S. investments in 
Indonesia, especially in oil, gas, and mining stand at about 
U.S. $25 billion, while its nonoil and nongas investments are at 
about U.S. $3.2 billion. The United States is the fifth largest 
investor in Indonesia after Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South 
Korea. 
  [Harymurti] What is the impact on bilateral relations of the 
U.S. threat to remove Generalized System of Preference [GSP] 
facilities? 
  [Siregar] Bilateral relations are quite cordial. More than 
10,000, maybe even 12,000 Indonesian students are now studying 
in the United States. Many have completed their studies and 
returned home. Viewed from various angles, bilateral relations 
are quite excellent. It is therefore regrettable if relations 
are strained due to the GSP and human rights issues. 
  [Harymurti] The GSP facilities involve only a small fraction 
of Indonesian exports to the United States. Why does the 
government appear to be nervous about the possible removal of 
GSP facilities? 
  [Siregar] It is true that only U.S. $640 million were 
derived from the GSP facilities from our exports to the United 
States in 1992, which stood at U.S. $4.5 billion. But if the 
GSP facilities are discontinued, this move may strain bilateral 
relations. As you know, Indonesia has been viewed in a negative 
way since the Dili incident on 12 November 1991. This problem 
continues to exist and may flare up again anytime. We witnessed 
U.S. Senator Feingold's attempt to ban the sale of arms to 
Indonesia. We noticed that the U.S. press often views Indonesia 
as a gross violator [three preceding words in English] of human 
rights, and this trend will emerge when the GSP facilities are 
indeed withdrawn in February. Therefore, I hope a satisfactory 
solution to the issue will soon be found. Otherwise, the 
negative consequences will be far greater. 
  [Harymurti] However, the main problem lies with the U.S. 
Congress and nongovernmental organizations, not the U.S. 
Government. How do you cope with them? 
  [Siregar] That is true. The Dili incident is the most 
difficult issue, and this will be a medium- or long-term issue. 
We need time to solve it. In view of the fact that the U.S. 
political system is different from that of other countries, 
including Indonesia, we cannot say that the main problem lies 
with the U.S. Congress and nongovernmental organizations. All 
of them should be seen as interdependent agencies. The GSP 
issue is one example. Nongovernmental organizations, such as 
Asia Watch and the AFL-CIO, are the agencies that take the 
initiative to have our GSP removed, but it is the U.S. 
Government that makes the decision. The same is true with the 
Feingold Amendment, namely a senator tabled the bill, but if 
Congress had approved it, the U.S. Government would have 
implemented the resolution to ban the arms sale. Therefore, 
they are inseparable. My personal view is that bilateral 
relations should not be strained by the GSP and workers' rights 
issues. 
  [Harymurti] There are fears that once the GSP is removed, 
other countries will follow the U.S. example. Is that true? 
  [Siregar] That is possible, because workers' rights are also 
part of human rights. 
  [Harymurti] What is the outcome of the ILO team's recent 
visit to Indonesia? They said that some of Indonesia's labor 
regulations are not up to the international standard. 
  [Siregar] I have not yet received a complete report on the 
issue, but at a hearing on 3 November 1993, the Indonesian 
Government, through its ambassador, said that it would take 
steps to improve workers' welfare. This is not due to the U.S. 
request. Hopefully the government will really take steps for the 
benefit of its own people and also as a means to appease the 
Americans. 
  [Harymurti] What about the case of Marsinah [labor activist 
murdered in East Java]? 
  [Siregar] Well, it is one of the cases the government has 
taken appropriate actions. Anybody believed to be involved in 
the case will be put on trial, and the court will pass its 
judgment soon. 
  [Harymurti] What category of U.S. investors are believed 
to have the strongest potential in Indonesia -- the medium or 
small-scale investors? 
  [Siregar] There are several categories. Let us say that the 
Freeport Corporation is a big one, but there are also many 
medium-scale investors, all of whom have invested a total of 
U.S. $3.2 billion, as I mentioned earlier. I see more potential 
for our exports to the United States, which are projected to 
increase by 25 percent next year. 
  [Harymurti] What is the ranking of our exports to the United 
States compared to that to other countries? 
  [Siregar] In terms of nonoil and nongas exports, the value 
of our exports to the United States is almost equivalent to that 
to Japan, namely at U.S. $3.9 billion. Out total exports to 
Japan stand at U.S. $10.8 billion. This means that the United 
States has become our second largest market for exports. As for 
the United States, the value of its imports from Indonesia ranks 
23rd. 
  [Harymurti] What kind of investment can we expect from the 
United States? 
  [Siregar] We can still expect a lot of U.S. investment in 
the oil and gas sector. An example is a project by Exxon. If 
it indeed materializes, it will be worth between $20 and $40 
billion. However, negotiations are still under way. For the 
nonoil and nongas sector, U.S. investment is still far smaller 
than that of Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. 
  [Harymurti] What efforts do you believe should be exerted to 
boost bilateral ties with the United States? 
  [Siregar] I believe promotional campaigns on trade, tourism, 
and investment should be intensified because many U.S. 
businessmen still do not have adequate information about 
Indonesia. Perhaps these businessmen will become potential 
investors. Therefore, I plan to visit Michigan, Louisiana, 
Georgia, Minnesota, and Texas along with members of the 
U.S.-ASEAN Council to persuade U.S. businessmen to invest in 
Indonesia or buy more Indonesian products. 
  [Harymurti] There are reports that many would-be investors 
are complaining about the lack of legal protection in Indonesia 
and also consider them as an obstacle to investment. 
  [Siregar] This is the typical attitude of American and 
Western people in general. They cannot make decision quickly. 
They must look at many aspects first, especially the legal one. 
For this reason, countries like Korea and Hong Kong tend to 
invest more in Indonesia. 
  [Harymurti] Some observers said that since the APEC meeting 
in Seattle, there has been a shift in the U.S. Government's 
stand on human rights and environment issues. 
  [Siregar] It is too early to say that. We must not forget 
one thing worth paying attention to, namely during the NAFTA 
debates, the U.S. Government strained its relations with the 
trade unions. The relations were so strained that President 
Clinton found it necessary to hold a special meeting with Lane 
Kirkland, chairman of the trade unions. We never know whether 
Clinton had to give some sort of concessions to the unionists on 
certain labor rights. It is indeed worth noting that the APEC 
meeting in Seattle has indirectly made us the focus of the U.S. 
public's interest. Perhaps we will reap its positive impact. 
However, the NAFTA debates may also have a negative impact. 
  [Harymurti] Do you attach great importance to the fact that 
Indonesia will host the APEC meeting next year? 
  [Siregar] Yes, I believe it is good for us to host the 
meeting because the leaders meeting [two preceding words in 
English] will be held for the second time. I believe this is 
very important. 
  [Harymurti] Therefore, are you optimistic that 
Indonesia-U.S. relations will continue to improve? 
  [Siregar] I cannot say that I am very optimistic, and I have 
to be cautious here because we never know how the GSP issue will 
turn out. I believe the GSP issue is crucial, and I hope it 
will be solved properly. But when the GSP issue is solved, it 
does not mean that everything will proceed smoothly because the 
East Timor issue is still haunting us. 
  [Harymurti] Until when? 
  [Siregar] It will take some time to find the solution. Right 
now, there are still protest demonstrations in Seattle and 
Washington, D.C. on East Timor. Even though the the U.S. press 
praises Indonesia's economic performance, they always try to 
find something negative. This is especially true with THE 
WASHINGTON POST, which often carries disturbing reports about 
Indonesia. 
  [Harymurti] As a former director of IMF, do you think the 
policies of the IMF and World Bank will be influenced by the 
human rights and democratic reform issues? 
  [Siregar] There are signs toward that end because donor 
nations are mostly Western countries. For example, the World 
Bank earlier paid no attention to environment issues. After the 
World Bank was heavily criticized, it now pays attention to the 
matter. The same is true with the human rights issue because 
the majority of World Bank shareholders are Western nations, 
which will of course put their priorities first. An example is 
that the IMF was earlier reluctant to give loans to Vietnam. 
The influence of big countries on this issue can be felt 
directly or indirectly. Even though staff members of this 
financial institution may voice their opposition to certain 
decisions, the decision making process lies in the hands of 
countries which are big shareholders.

  [Text] Medan, North Sumatra, Feb 4 (ANEX-ANTARA) -- 
Indonesia's power projects in Repelita VI (sixth Five-year 
Development Plan, 1994/99) will need a total investment of 60 
trillion rupiah (U.S.$30 billion), a senior official said here 
on Thursday. 
  Director General for Electricity and Energy Development Yoga 
Pranoto of the Ministry of Mines and Energy said that the 
investments include interest rates and costs for another 
investments in similar projects in the next Repelita 
(1999-2004). He said that the funds for power projects in 
Repelita VI will be obtained from the state-owned electricity 
firm, government assistance through approved project list, and 
government's capital. 
  Other funds will also come from state-owned and private 
banks 
as well as from sales of bonds, Pranoto added. 
  Half of the U.S. $30 billion will be used to finance power 
distribution network projects, the director general revealed. 
  "Power projects are expected to meet the people's need for 
electricity which will continue to rise in the coming ten 
years," he said. 
  Indonesia's need for electrical power will increase by 
[figures indistinct] percent annually in the next decade. By 
1995, the country needs to double its electrical capacity from 
the present 11,500 megawatts to nearly 23,000 megawatts. 
  Meanwhile, private investments for the coming ten year's 
power projects are now at 11.3 billion U.S. dollars.

  [Text] Jakarta, Feb 4 (ANEX-ANTARA) -- Armed Forces 
Commander General Feizal Tanjung said that recent demonstrations 
staged by students and workers at a more frequent rate are still 
considered to be at the level of toleration. Gen. Tanjung said 
in a parliamentary hearing here Thursday that the recent 
demonstrations have not yet disturbed the national stability as 
they were held spontaneously to protest unfair social conditions. 
  Student protest demonstrations are understandable, the 
commander said, and should be welcomed as they reflect the 
student's awareness of what is happening around them. However, 
he said, the government should always be on the alert to prevent 
such demonstrations from becoming a public disturbance which can 
threaten national stability. 
  Tanjung dismissed widespread opinions that the government, 
in 
this case the Armed Forces is being over reactive to the 
demonstrations, thereby spoiling the government's promotion of 
openness and democratisation as well as human rights in the 
country. 
  "Such a view is not right. The armed forces are always 
committed to acting in accordance with values contained in the 
system of pancasila democracy," he said. 
  Any actions being launched by the Armed Forces are always 
based on the existing law and regulations, and more is aimed at 
preventing law violations, the general stressed. 
  Amid the meeting between the armed forces commander with the 
parliamentary commission in charge of security affairs, a number 
of youths were demonstrating outside the parliament building to 
protest against Bakrie Brothers's plan to build a resort near 
Tanah Lot temple on the tourist island of Bali.

Hanoi time on 4 February -- at the White House in the capital 
city of Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton announced his 
decision to lift the trade embargo against Vietnam and open a 
United States liaison office in Hanoi. 
  He said: Today I am lifting the trade embargo against 
Vietnam, because I am absolutely convinced that it offers the 
best way to resolve the fate of those who remain missing and 
unaccounted for. 
  The President reviewed U.S. efforts to search for missing 
American servicemen and stressed that efforts will continue to 
obtain more information about American servicemen who are 
prisoners or who are missing. He also announced that a United 
State liaison office will be set up in Vietnam to provide 
services to Americans in Vietnam and help follow up on human 
rights dialogue with the Vietnamese Government. 
  President Clinton also said that the decision does not 
involve the normalization of relations: Before that happens, we 
must have more progress and cooperation; more answers. In this 
regard, he will send another high-ranking delegation to Vietnam 
to search for additional human remains and documents. 
  Secretary of State Christopher; Secretary of Defense Aspin; 
Joint Chiefs Chairman Shalikashvili; and many other high-ranking 
officials and senators, including Mr. John Kerry, were among 
those who attended the conference.

bring them into Cairo, however, he was detected and the 
equipment was confiscated. The source noted that the attempt of 
the North Korean official to smuggle these electronic products

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- Japan expressed hope Friday 
[4 February] that the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo against 
Vietnam will contribute to peace and prosperity in the 
Asia-Pacific region. 
  "At last, spring came to U.S.-Vietnam relations," Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference. "I 
perceive it as a very hopeful development." 
  The top government spokesman also said, "I hope the improved 
ties between the two nations will not be restricted to them 
alone but contribute to the peace and prosperity in the broader 
Asia-Pacific region." 
  Takemura issued the comment shortly after U.S. President 
Bill 
Clinton announced he is lifting the 19-year-old embargo against 
Vietnam. 
  Clinton also said the United States and Vietnam have decided 
to exchange liaison offices in Hanoi and Washington to 
facilitate more progress on the missing Americans issue. 
  He removed the sanctions a week after the Senate voted 
overwhelmingly in favor of lifting the embargo in recognition of 
Vietnam's cooperation in accounting for the fate of 2,238 
Americans still listed as missing in Vietnam, and also in the 
hope that Hanoi will cooperate more on the issue. 
  The United States imposed an economic embargo on 
communist-ruled North Vietnam in 1964 and extended it to the 
whole country when the U.S.-backed regime in Saigon fell to 
communist forces in April 1975.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- Japan welcomed Friday [4 
February] the United States announcement that it will lift its 
nearly two decades-long trade embargo against Vietnam which is 
expected to pave the way for normalization of Washington-Hanoi 
ties. 
  "Japan welcomes the decision made by U.S. President Bill 
Clinton to lift the trade embargo against Vietnam as a 
significant step toward the normalization of U.S.-Vietnam 
relations," Foreign Ministry Spokesman Terusuke Terada said. 
  Japan regards the U.S. decision as "contributing not only to 
the improvement of the U.S.-Vietnam relationship but also to the 
peace and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region," Terada said. 
  He said Japan has been making diplomatic efforts to 
facilitate the improvement of U.S.-Vietnam ties, such as urging 
Vietnamese Government officials to cooperate with the U.S. in 
resolving problems involving Americans Missing in Action (MIAs) 
in the Vietnam war. 
  Tokyo has also been telling the U.S. Government it is "very 
important to ameliorate" Washington-Hanoi ties, he said. 
  Clinton announced Thursday he would lift the 19-year-old 
trade embargo against Vietnam, citing "tangible progress" in the 
accounting of American MIAs. 
  He also said the U.S. and Vietnam have decided to exchange 
liaison offices in Hanoi and Washington to facilitate more 
progress on the MIA issue. 
  But Clinton said the measure does not constitute a 
normalization of diplomatic relations, saying, "before that 
happens, we must have more progress, more cooperation and more 
answers." 
  The U.S. imposed an economic embargo on communist-ruled 
North Vietnam in 1964 and extended it to the whole country when 
the U.S.-backed regime in Saigon fell to communist forces in 
April 1975.

  [Text] In preparation for the Japan-U.S. summit set for 11 
February, the government is hastening its work on how to deal 
with the U.S. mass media, as, among other plans, Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa will be granting an exclusive interview to the 
chief of THE WASHINGTON POST's Far East bureau. Even though the 
finale is approaching, real progress has yet to be seen in the 
Japan-U.S. framework trade talks, which will top the summit's 
agenda. However, the government is steadily making progress in 
its strategy to build up the prime minister's image. 
  According to a government authority, THE WASHINGTON POST's 
Far East bureau chief is considered the likely candidate to whom 
Prime Minister Hosokawa plans to grant an exclusive interview 
since the government has judged that "in comparison to the chief 
of the Tokyo branch of THE NEW YORK TIMES -- THE WASHINGTON 
POSTS's rival newspaper -- who tends to be critical of Japan in 
his commentaries, THE WASHINGTON POSTS's Far East bureau chief 
has a more favorable view of Japan; the fact that he has taught 
at the Kumamoto University also conjures up a feeling of 
intimacy." In the United States, public criticism of Japan 
mounted in the advent of the 50th anniversary of the Japanese 
attack on Pearl Harbor in World War II. Michio Watanabe, who was 
then foreign minister, granted an interview to a THE WASHINGTON 
POST reporter. Apparently, some quarters of the Foreign 
Ministry said that this interview helped calm the situation. 
  The government also plans to take the opportunity for 
Hosokawa to address the American people via the U.S. radio 
network prior to the summit. In Washington, there are plans for 
the prime minister to lecture on Japanese policies at Georgetown 
University and for him to appear on local television, too. 
  Koichiro Matsuura, deputy vice minister of foreign affairs, 
who will stand in the forefront as chairman of the Japanese 
negotiating party in the framework trade talks, is scheduled to 
grant an exclusive interview to THE WALL STREET JOURNAL's Tokyo 
branch chief. As for news organs which will not be granted 
exclusive interviews, it is expected that they will be attended 
to separately by Yukio Sato, chief of the Foreign Ministry's 
North American Affairs Bureau, and Kazuo Ogura, chief of the 
ministry's Economics Affairs Bureau. 
  By being selective with reporters, the government's strategy 
to deal with U.S. mass media is said to be primarily aimed at 
"providing appropriate information so that accurate commentaries 
can be drawn from them." 
  Although Prime Minister Hosokawa spoke with U.S. President 
Bill Clinton over the phone on 31 January, their conversation 
ended in "rhetorical" exchange, according to officials close to 
the prime minister. On the surface, preparations for Hosokawa's 
U.S. visit continues with rough sailing, but, underneath, the 
government continues working shrewdly on its plans geared toward 
the U.S. mass media.

  [Text] U.S. Trade Representative Kantor, on a visit to 
Japan, met with Prime Minister Hosokawa at the latter's official 
residence on the afternoon of 3 February. Commenting on a 
6-trillion-yen income tax cut and the "creation of a national 
welfare tax" that the prime minister announced in the early dawn 
of 3 February, Mr. Kantor said: "You made a proper decision." 
In this way, he highly rated the prime minister's tax measures 
taken as part of stimulus measures. 
  Mr. Kantor met with Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii prior to 
his meeting with the prime minister. During the meeting, Mr. 
Kantor warned that "if the Japan-U.S. summit slated for 11 
February ends in failure, it would have a great impact on the 
world economy." Referring to negotiations on the insurance 
sector under the Japan- U.S. economic framework talks, Mr. 
Kantor asked that Japan adopt "objective criteria" to measure 
the share of foreign insurance firms on the Japanese insurance 
market. In response, Finance Minister Fujii said: "The share 
is something that must be decided by the business activities of 
foreign firms."

  [Text] U.S. Trade Representative Kantor visited Japan to 
break a deadlock in Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, but his 
goal of visiting Japan probably went unachieved. Mr. Kantor 
failed to extract a "political decision" from Japanese leaders 
on setting numerical targets and the 6 trillion yen in income 
tax cuts, that the prime minister announced in the early dawn of 
3 February, fell short of fulfilling U.S. expectations. Some 
U.S. Government officials are hinting at the possibility of the 
United States slapping sanctions against Japan, saying: "Now 
that Mr. Kantor's Tokyo visit failed to move forward Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks, we have no choice but to take 
hard-line measures." Hence, the Japan-U.S. summit slated for 11 
February is highly likely to be held in an uncomfortable 
atmosphere. 
  At meetings with Prime Minister Hosokawa and Finance 
Minister 
Fujii, Mr. Kantor highly spoke of the government's decision to 
cut the income tax, but a U.S. Government source in Tokyo 
complained about the size of the income tax cut, saying: "The 
income tax reduction is short 1-2 trillion yen from what the 
U.S. Government expected." The prevailing view is that Mr. 
Kantor refrained from expressing his unhappiness with the size 
of the income tax cut after concluding that any further U.S. 
pressure on the Hosokawa government, beset with the issue of 
securing financial resources to make up for a fiscal shortfall 
incurring from the income tax reduction, will not serve the 
interests of the United States. For the United States, Prime 
Minister Hosokawa is the only Japanese leader who can decide on 
Japan's concessions at the talks. 
  During his Japan stay, Mr. Kantor took a very tough attitude 
at a series of meetings with the prime minister and cabinet 
ministers. At a 2 February meeting with Tsutomu Hata, deputy 
prime minister and foreign minister, the American official said: 
"Japan and the United States are engaged in the three pillars 
of economy, security, and international cooperation." His 
statement meant not to stress the importance of bilateral 
matters other than the bilateral economic issue, but to suggest 
that if the bilateral economic issue is not resolved, it would 
undermine the entire Japan-U.S. relationship, including 
international cooperation and security. His statement can be 
taken as a strong U.S. resolve that it will not hesitate to 
review Japan-U.S. relations that [President Clinton once called] 
the "most important bilateral relations in the world."

<F P=106> [From "Hourly" column: "Time Is Running Out and No Way Out </F>
Is Seen"] 
  [Text] Japan-U.S. negotiations on automobiles and auto 
parts, which have become the centerpiece of Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks, are still deadlocked over the question of 
setting "numerical targets" to measure the expansion of Japan's 
import of foreign-made goods. U.S. Trade Representative Kantor, 
who visited Japan to urge the Japanese to make a political 
decision, met on 2 February with Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister, 
and Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of the Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry [MITI], but their meeting appears to have 
failed to produce any agreement. The negotiations on the three 
priority sectors of automobiles-auto parts, government 
procurement, and insurance are set to be concluded prior to the 
Japan-U.S. summit. With the summit 10 days away, however, no 
way is seen to break the deadlock in the negotiations. 
<H5>  The Government's Situation </H5>
  The meeting between Foreign Minister Hata and U.S. Trade 
Representative Kantor at the Foreign Ministry lasted one and a 
half hours longer than scheduled. A meeting between Finance 
Minister Fujii and U.S. Trade Representative Kantor has been 
deferred until later. A Finance Ministry official angrily said, 
"We managed to arrange a meeting for them despite our minister's 
busy schedule, but he did not show up." 
  Originally, the Japanese were in no mood to welcome Kantor's 
visit, saying: "Japan-U.S. economic framework talks are to be 
concluded at vice ministerial talks. It is hard for us to do 
anything even if he presses us." A senior MITI official 
emphatically told a group of reporters on the evening of 1 
February that "I hope he will meet with people he wants to meet 
and then put forth a new policy after returning to the United 
States." 
  The U.S. has not hidden its aim that Mr. Kantor was sent to 
Japan to lobby Prime Minister Hosokawa and cabinet ministers for 
Japanese trade concessions over the heads of Japanese 
bureaucrats who are still poised to "reject the U.S. demand for 
setting numerical targets." Japanese bureaucrats are fully 
confident of dealing with Mr. Kantor, saying, "He will only 
confirm that Japanese Cabinet ministers and bureaucrats share 
the same view." 
  Of the three priority sectors of the government procurement 
of telecommunications gear and medical instruments, 
automobiles-auto parts, and insurance, the negotiations on the 
automobiles and auto parts have been deadlocked and no way is in 
sight to break the deadlock. It was once observed that "the 
Japanese side will try to settle the negotiations by asking 
Japanese automakers to work out plans to increase their purchase 
of foreign auto parts," but MITI, in charge of the negotiations, 
still sticks to its tough attitude against asking Japanese 
automakers to do so, saying, "We cannot ask Japanese automakers 
to work out plans that may be transformed into numerical 
targets." 
  The present situation is that even if the Japanese 
Government 
decides to concede to U.S. trade demands, Japanese enterprises 
could not accept such a decision. The Japanese automobile 
industry, which is beset with unprecedented sluggish sales and 
the restored competitiveness of the American automobile 
industry, is in a situation where it cannot satisfy the U.S. 
demand for increased purchases of American-made auto parts. A 
senior MITI official says, "Even if aides to the prime minister 
instruct Japanese automakers to seek a compromise, they cannot 
move at all." The "bureaucrats" closet themselves in shells 
only awaiting concessions from the U.S. 
<H5>  The Situation of Politics </H5>
  At a 30 January meeting with Toyota Motor Corporation 
President Shoichiro Toyoda and other business leaders, Prime 
Minister Hosokawa showed his irritation with the Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks that have continued to face rough 
sailing, saying: "It seems that bureaucrats from the two 
countries have failed to smooth over their differences in the 
talks." 
  The prime minister appears to have made the statement in 
response to the U.S. criticism that "the Japanese bureaucrats do 
not understand Prime Minister Hosokawa's aims for reform." 
Officials close to the prime minister have yet to fashion a 
blueprint for the prime minister to make a political decision. 
  Good prospects are seen for mapping out a new package of 
stimulus measures that will be high on the agenda of the 
upcoming Japan-U.S. summit and this is the only bright factor. 
Commenting on the negotiations in the individual sector, MITI 
Minister Kumagai has said: "The Hosokawa government's policy is 
that it will reduce its intervention in enterprises' economic 
activities." As a result, it would be hard for Prime Minister 
Hosokawa to resort to a "political decision," which has been 
used as a stereotyped means in past negotiations with the United 
States. 
  As for the negotiations that are entering an impasse, the 
Foreign Ministry has begun saying in an irritated tone: "An 
accord should be reached in one way or another at the upcoming 
Japan-U.S. summit on 11 February. We do not care about Japanese 
bureaucrats being criticized as villains if the United States is 
satisfied." 
  Japanese Ambassador to Washington Takakazu Kuriyama, who is 
in Tokyo on a temporary visit, reported on 1 February to the 
prime minister that "although the U.S. Government has a good 
impression of the Hosokawa government, it is tough in the 
negotiations with Japan." The above-mentioned senior MITI 
official said: "We are a little bit concerned how Mr. Kuriyama 
explained this to the prime minister." Delicate domestic 
negotiations have already begun.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article; "No Agreement Reached on Numerical </F>
Targets"] 
  [Text] U.S. Trade Representative Kantor visited Japan as 
an envoy of President Clinton to break a deadlock in Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks, but a series of meetings between him 
and Japanese Cabinet ministers ended 3 February, leaving the 
split in their opinions over numerical targets unbridged. Mr. 
Kantor left Japan for the United States on 4 February and it is 
believed he will report to President Clinton that the Japanese 
are determined to block the "numerical targets." Now, how the 
upcoming Japan-U.S. summit will settle the dispute over 
numerical targets has become a focal point. 
  During the series of meetings with Japanese ministers, Mr. 
Kantor stressed the importance of Japan-U.S. relations and then 
said: "If the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks fail to 
produce any results, the United States would adopt a different 
way." In this way, he suggested that the United States will not 
hesitate to restore the Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus 
Trade Act. In response to his remarks, the Japanese side said: 
"He took a tough attitude in an attempt to press Japan for 
trade concessions" and added that this tough attitude was 
anticipated.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yutaka Kume, chairman of the Japan </F>
Automobile Manufacturers Association and Nissan Motor 
Corporation, by economic news reporter Haruyuki Aikawa; first in 
three-part series of interviews with key industrial leaders in 
priority sectors under negotiation at the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks, entitled: "The Japan-U.S. Economic Framework 
Talks: My Arguments"; place and date not given; first paragraph 
is MAINICHI SHIMBUN introduction] 
  [Text] The Japan-U.S. economic framework talks will enter 
a critical phase leading up to the summit meeting on 11 
February. Insurance, automobiles and auto parts, and government 
procurement (telecommunications and medical equipment) have been 
designated as the three priority sectors at the negotiations on 
specific areas. Industry leaders in these sectors give their 
"arguments" in this series of interviews. 
  [Aikawa] What is your impression of the framework talks? 
  [Kume] Reciprocity between Japan and the United States 
should be the basic principle not only in the automobiles 
sector, but also in the framework talks as a whole. However, 
what has happened so far is one-sided demands from the United 
States. There are areas under the government's jurisdiction, 
and there are areas which are not. Automobiles is a business 
sector. I think negotiations at the governmental level will not 
work. 
  [Aikawa] The United States is pushing hard for numerical 
targets. 
  [Kume] We will not compromise on that point. It is the 
United States, which needs to exert more efforts, that should be 
asked to set targets; Japan should not be asked to make 
commitments. Therefore, it is absurd to complain if we are not 
able to fulfill the voluntary plan to purchase U.S.-made auto 
parts of January 1992. If the United States attempts to extend 
or strengthen this voluntary plan, I do not think the European 
Union will remain indifferent. 
  [Aikawa] What have you done to fulfill the plan to make 
purchases worth $19 billion? 
  [Kume] All automobile companies wish to remedy the trade 
imbalance between the two countries. That was why we came up 
with the plan in 1992. However, the target was set based on a 
projection of demand at that time. The Japanese economic 
recession has been worse than expected, while economic recovery 
in the United States has not been fast enough. Under such 
circumstances, we have been working hard to fulfill the target 
even to the disadvantage of Japanese parts makers. 
  [Aikawa] Are any further efforts at the private level 
possible? 
  [Kume] Regarding auto parts, we have created a venue for 
discussion with U.S. parts makers, and held trade negotiations. 
The "design-in" method entailing joint development from the 
design phase is becoming popular. Since we have a 
responsibility to our customers, we have to buy good parts. 
  [Aikawa] How about finished cars? 
  [Kume] We have no intention to buy the Big Three's cars. As 
Japanese car makers have invested manpower and money in building 
a network of sales outlets in the United States, the Big Three 
should also do the same on their own. However, I can imagine 
that it will be quite difficult to start now because land prices 
are so high. What they can do is talk to the dealers. The 
problem lies in the attitude of claiming "it is outrageous that 
my cars are not selling" without making any efforts to launch 
cars suitable for the traffic conditions and parking lots in 
Japan onto the market. 
  [Aikawa] Automobiles make up 60 percent of the Japan-U.S. 
trade imbalance. 
  [Kume] If you take the sum of trade imbalance as the 
denominator, and the differential in Japan-U.S. auto trade as 
the numerator, you indeed come up with the figure of 60 percent. 
But that is meaningless. We import all our civilian aircraft, 
and buy a lot of agricultural products. I would like to ask: 
How do you compute that? It is unreasonable to take up trade, 
particularly, trade in specific sectors, as a bilateral issue. 
  [Aikawa] How about a political settlement? 
  [Kume] It will not be possible to come up with a political 
settlement without talking to the business sector. Even though 
we asserted that automobiles should not be included in the 
agenda of the framework talks, Former Prime Minister Kiichi 
Miyazawa made a serious concession during the last days of his 
administration. Rather than reaching a senseless compromise, we 
might as well forget about concluding the talks in haste. An 
unacceptable agreement to the automobile industry will have 
serious damage.

<F P=106> [Interview with Takashi Onoda, chairman of the Marine and </F>
Fire Insurance Association of Japan, and president of Sumitomo 
Marine and Fire Insurance Company, by economic news reporter 
Haruyuki Aikawa; second in three-part series of interviews with 
key industrial leaders in priority sectors under negotiation as 
the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, entitled: "The 
Japan-U.S. Economic Framework Talks: My Arguments"; place and 
date not given] 
  [Text] [Aikawa] What is your impression of the framework 
talks? 
  [Onoda] We still cannot understand why insurance has been 
taken up as a priority area. The share of foreign insurance 
companies in Japan is 4.2 percent, while the Japanese share in 
the United States is merely 0.1 percent. The framework talks 
are supposed to deal with the issue of reducing the Japanese 
surplus. In insurance, Japan suffers from a huge deficit. We do 
not understand what the United States wants. 
  [Aikawa] The United States is asking for a market share of 
more than 10 percent. 
  [Onoda] Insurance policies are chosen by the individual and 
institutional clients. There can be no compulsion. In Japan, 
three-fourths of policies are individual ones, the remaining 
ones institutional. To achieve a share of more than 10 percent 
immediately, we have to give them half of the institutional 
insurance policies. That is impossible. 
  [Aikawa] There should be more sales efforts on the part of 
U.S. companies. 
  [Onoda] Some U.S. insurance companies which entered the 
market immediately after World War II, such as AIU, now have 
sales in Japan comparable to leading Japanese life insurance 
companies. For example, the American Family Insurance, which is 
well-known for cancer insurance, makes more sales in Japan than 
in the United States. A greater market share can be achieved 
through corporate efforts. 
  Moreover, Japan is an open market which gives foreign 
insurance companies national treatment. On the contrary, the 
United States has different systems in individual states, and 
there is discrimination against foreign companies. Our company 
has not even been granted a license in some states. If you go 
by the principle of two-way negotiations, it is the United 
States that needs to make improvements. 
  [Aikawa] The United States is opposed to deregulation in 
third sector insurance, such as nursing care insurance, where 
both life and non-life insurance companies are eligible to 
participate. 
  [Onoda] The third sector, which lies between life and 
non-life insurance, is an area where some U.S. companies are 
relatively strong. It is totally self-serving to ask for 
liberalization on the one hand, while attempting to keep the 
regulations in areas where one has an advantage. 
  [Aikawa] There is also criticism against "keiretsu" [a group 
of closely affiliated companies] transactions. 
  [Onoda] While there are indeed instances of mutual 
shareholding, this makes up a negligible portion of the whole 
industry. We make arduous marketing efforts under free 
competition, and an overwhelming proportion of our business is 
from outside the "keiretsu." 
  The concept of insurance is very different in the United 
States. In the United States, insurance companies accept 
insurance at a low premium. But once there is an accident, the 
premium immediately goes up, or the companies refuse to accept 
insurance. In contrast, the principle of Japanese insurance 
services is stability, continuity, and security. While the 
premium may be a little higher, a client would choose a Japanese 
company from the long-term point of view. It is important for 
U.S. insurance companies to also conduct followup visits, and 
adopt some Japanese business practices to gain the clients' 
trust. 
  [Aikawa] What do you want the government to do? 
  [Onoda] We hope this issue will not be brought to the summit 
conference table and be subject to a bold political settlement.

  [Text] Tokyo -- Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota met with 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa at the prime minister's 
official residence on the morning of 1 February. While calling 
for the prime minister's understanding of and support for the 
early enactment of a law on special measures for use of military 
bases after their return, which is still pending, Governor Ota 
appealed for settling issues regarding the U.S. military bases 
in Okinawa. In response, Prime Minister Hosokawa mentioned such 
facts as details of his recent meetings with former U.S. Defense 
Secretary Les Aspin and U.S. Forces Pacific Commander-in-Chief 
Larson, and said: "I have a good understanding of the present 
situation in Okinawa. I have talked over the issues (on the 
U.S. military bases) with the U.S. ambassador to Japan and the 
commander-in-chief of the U.S. Forces on every possible 
occasion." In this way, he stressed his positive approach 
toward the military base issues. Meanwhile, Kosuke Uehara, 
director general of the Okinawa Development Agency, who 
accompanied Governor Ota, called on Hosokawa "to bring up the 
Okinawa issue for discussion during his visit to the United 
States." In response, Hosokawa said: "Yes. I understand." 
Thus, he hinted that the Okinawa issue may be brought as one of 
the topics for discussions at the summit with U.S. President 
Bill Clinton. This was the first face-to-face talks between 
Governor Ota and Prime Minister Hosokawa. 
  In addition to the issue on legislation of a law on special 
measures for use of military bases after their return, Governor 
Ota asked Prime Minister Hosokawa for his support in settling 
three other major issues that have to be solved urgently. They 
are: the return of Naha Naval Port; abolition of live-fire 
exercises conducted across Prefectural Highway 104; and the 
return of the Yomitan auxiliary airfield and abolition of 
parachuting exercises conducted at this airfield. Moreover, 
concerning the handling of misfired shells, Ota asked Hosokawa 
to understand that this issue has to be settled too, and said: 
"There are misfired shells left over from the battle on 
Okinawa, and also misfired shells from the live-fire exercises 
conducted by U.S. Forces. However, we are concerned with the 
danger involved in the disposal of misfired shells at the 
exercise sites." 
  Prime Minister Hosokawa stated his profound understanding of 
the base-connected issues, and said: "I understand the present 
situation in Okinawa very well, and I also understand that 
Okinawa residents were forced to suffer many problems during and 
after the last war. I would like to make the situation in 
Okinawa (concerning the Okinawa-related issues) turn for the 
better." Moreover, in response to the request made by Director 
General Uehara, who stated that "the prime minister would 
certainly have a hard time in dealing with many problems" but 
asked that "the Okinawa issue be brought up during his visit to 
the United States," Prime Minister Hosokawa promised he would do 
his best, saying, "I understand your points quite well." 
  In addition to Director General Uehara, Noboru Shimajiri, 
head of the Okinawa General Chapter of the Japan New Party, 
attended the meeting. As viewed from his standpoint as part of 
the ruling coalition, Shimajiri urged the prime minister to 
understand the Okinawa-related issues and support their 
settlement. They met with Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi 
Takemura at 1020 and made the same requests. 
  As part of its mission to appeal for settlement of 
base-related issues and the legislation of the law on special 
measures on the use of military land after their return, the 
governor's party plans to call at the concerned ministries and 
agencies, including the Defense Agency, the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, and the Defense Facilities Administration Agency, as 
well as concerned Diet members in the afternoon.

<F P=106> [From "Current" column; "Gap Between MITI, Automobile </F>
Industry Over Plans To Purchase Auto Parts] 
  [Text] A ripple is occurring between the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI] and the automobile 
industry over the way to handle Japan-U.S. economic framework 
talks. Negotiations on the automobile and auto parts sector is 
now facing rough sailing because Japan has rejected the U.S. 
demand for setting numerical targets. The automobile industry's 
cooperation is indispensable for settling the negotiations prior 
to the Japan-U.S. summit slated for 11 February and the gap 
between MITI and the automobile industry holds the key to the 
direction the negotiations will take. 
  It was reported on 2 February that MITI asked Japanese 
automakers to submit their plans every year for the purchase of 
foreign-made auto parts and the report has become controversial. 
Enraged by the report, Yutaka Kume, president of the Japan 
Automobile Manufacturers Association (and president of Nissan 
Motor Corporation), asked MITI to categorically deny the report. 
President Kume was enraged by the report because it came 
shortly after he; Tatsuro Toyoda, president of Toyota Motor 
Corporation; and Nobuhiko Kawamoto, president of Honda Motor 
Company, met with Hiroshi Kumagai, MITI minister, to ask the 
latter to oppose the U.S. demand for setting numerical targets. 
  Japanese automakers worked out their voluntary plans for the 
purchase of $19 billion worth of American-made auto parts in 
January 1992 when Former President Bush visited Japan, but the 
plans have transformed into a Japanese commitment to the United 
States. The Japanese automakers have this bitter experience. 
In the recent negotiations on the automobile and auto parts 
sector, MITI proposed a cooperative approach in which both 
Japanese and American automobile industries cooperate in trading 
auto parts. MITI Minister Kumagai has said: "It would be good 
if automakers in the two nations decide on their trade of auto 
parts." In this way, Mr. Kumagai is eager to look for a way to 
break the deadlock in the negotiations through the formula of 
voluntary cooperation between automakers of the two nations. 
  President Kume once said: "The negotiations on the 
automobile sector should be held between automakers of the two 
countries and it is ridiculous that two nations' governments 
intervene in their trade." In this way, Japanese automakers are 
increasingly reacting against the intergovernmental 
negotiations. With the Japan-U.S. summit one week away, MITI is 
getting increasingly irritated.

  [Text] While speaking at a 1 February news conference 
about a government plan to purchase Airborne Warning and Control 
System (AWACS) aircraft, Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], said: "Since the world 
has entered an age of disarmament, it is important for Japan -- 
which embraces a Constitution advocating the preservation of 
peace -- to exercise leadership. In particular, the plan to 
purchase AWACS aircarft should be shelved." The issue of the 
AWACS purchase has become one of the focal points in working out 
the draft national budget for fiscal 1994. Murayama thus 
indicated his opposition to appropriate funds in the draft 
budget for their procurement.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ryuzo Sejima, former chairman of the </F>
Consultative Committee for Strengthening Diplomacy, by AERA 
editorial staff Hidetoshi Sotooka; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Sotooka] Last August, the Foreign Ministry 
started to strengthen its intelligence ability in response to 
recommendations made by the consultative committee which you 
chaired. What were the recommendations' aim and background? 
  [Sejima] After the end of the Cold War, the world witnessed 
the breakout of the Persian Gulf war and a series of isolated 
conflicts and faced a number of tasks such as environmental and 
human rights problems. The world has entered an era of 
multipolarization and diversification. In Japan, meanwhile, the 
bubble economy has continued to burst and domestic politics and 
economy have gone into a period of instability. With these as 
the background, my basic understanding was that there was a need 
to strengthen the diplomatic power. 
  As a way to invigorate the Foreign Ministry, to begin with, 
it was proposed to strengthen its international intelligence 
ability, its capability to draw up comprehensive foreign 
policies and functions of diplomatic establishments abroad, and, 
at the same time, to increase the number of diplomatic personnel 
by 1,000 in several years. Although I tackled the 
administrative reform problem aiming for a slim government, I 
had a different idea about the Foreign Ministry, feeling that 
the present status would not do. 
  [Sotooka] Do you mean that the present intelligence 
capabilities are insufficient? 
  [Sejima] For example, the number of Foreign Ministry 
personnel is half that of the United Kingdom and one-third that 
of the United States. A young diplomat in charge of an area 
covers eight countries by himself. As things are, it is 
impossible to cover the whole world. Diplomatic establishments 
abroad are still dependent on an outdated communications system. 
That has to be modernized. Furthermore, collection and analysis 
of information at the ministry proper lacked coordination 
because they were handled vertically from the bottom up. 
Coordination is indispensable to intelligence capabilities. 
  [Sotooka] What international intelligence capability does 
Japan need? 
  [Sejima] A nation's intelligence power is dependent on four 
factors. The first is that a nation is not internationally 
isolated. It has to have more allied and friendly nations. The 
second is that close relations should be firmly established 
between the Foreign Ministry bureau that handles information and 
other government agencies. The third is that intelligence 
capability at diplomatic establishments abroad should be 
superior in both quality and quantity and it has to supplement 
private intelligence. The fourth is that a network of 
international communications should be firmly established. 
  Japan's diplomatic response was superb before and after the 
Russo-Japanese War. When the war became inevitable, Japan 
signed the Anglo-Japanese Alliance Treaty, posted an envoy in 
the United States early enough to feel out the possibility of 
U.S. intervention when the time for ending the war came, and 
dispatched Korekiyo Takahashi in Europe to raise money for war 
expenditures. Immediately after the victory at the Battle of 
Mukden, war termination was sought. However, in World War II, 
Japan was isolated internationally because it had withdrawn from 
the League of Nations and its intelligence capabilities were 
extraordinarily weak. Weak intelligence capabilities were 
apparent in the fact that Japan overestimated the strength of 
Germany and Italy, while it underestimated that of the United 
States and the United Kingdom. 
  [Sotooka] It is feared that strengthening intelligence 
capabilities will lead to big power status. 
  [Sejima] There is no need to be aware of big or small power. 
Even if a nation wants to be a small power, it is necessary to 
strengthen its intelligence capabilities. During World War II, 
I took special note of information in countries between the 
Soviet Union and Germany, such as Finland, Sweden, and Poland. 
Their information was highly reliable, because their national 
existence depended on the information. 
  [Sotooka] What is your understanding of relations between 
national security and intelligence? 
  [Sejima] Japan has to maintain national security and the 
lives of the people and it is important for Japan to become a 
nation that can be trusted by the world. 
  On the average over the past 20 years, Japan has been 
importing 600 million tons of resources and raw materials 
annually and exporting 70 million tons of products that have 
competitive power. The nation's foundation rests on peaceful 
exchanges with the world. Without winning the trust of others, 
both imports of 600 million tons and exports of 70 million tons 
cannot be carried out successfully. 
  Japan's foundation rests on peace and diligence. 
Realistically speaking, I think that Japan should be a 
defense-oriented nation. It has a wonderful peace Constitution 
and it requires little national investment for armaments. In 
the present world, a military offensive operation demands 
nuclear weapons, but I am against possessing nuclear arms. 
  Meanwhile, in mankind's history of war, a defense-oriented 
nation won a war only when its intelligence capabilities 
excelled. There has never been a case of passively winning a 
war. Information must be obtained to maintain independence. 
  Speaking of the people as a whole, their regard for 
information is still low, I think. 
  [Sotooka] Please define intelligence capabilities from the 
standpoint of your work in intelligence from the wartime to the 
post-war period. 
  [Sejima] Intelligence capabilities has four processes, 
namely, collection, judgment of reliability, judgment of 
situation, and response. In the collection stage, a certain 
amount of information is required. However, the most important 
is how the situation is assessed. If affected by response and 
favor, judgment will become blurred. When I worked in the field 
of drawing up military operations, situations tended to be 
judged in favor of responses, in the end. At the consultation 
meeting, such ideas as setting up an independent organization 
and training 10,000 intelligence officers were introduced. 
  However, a government must be slim and it is doubtful 
whether 
increased quantity of information will do. After all, personnel 
increases would be a waste. In other words, whether calm and 
thoroughgoing judgment can be made or not depends on the quality 
of the people in charge.

<F P=106> [Article by AERA editor Shunji Taoka: "No One Knew North </F>
Korea Had Test-Launched a Missile"] 
  [Text] On 29 May 1993, North Korea test-fired a ballistic 
missile called "Nodong-I" into the Sea of Japan off the Noto 
Peninsula. For about a week, the Japanese Government was not 
aware of it. It did not know about it until it was informed by 
the United States. 
  A flurry of activity was created in the Defense Agency [DA] 
when the government officially announced the news on 11 June. 
It immediately analyzed a tape-recorded radio report, and it 
confirmed the test-launch about three days later. 
  The government has long been informed by U.S. Forces sources 
of imminent test-firings of North Korean missiles. However, 
unlike the United States, which is constantly watching North 
Korea, thanks to its spy satellites, Japan has no such ability 
to gather information by itself. All it can do is make a guess 
from information released by the U.S. Forces and from the 
activities of U.S. reconnaissance planes. 
  After the test-launch, the United States explained that the 
development of Nodong-II -- a larger missile with an estimated 
range of 1,300 km -- was already under way, by showing a picture 
taken by one of its spy satellites. With an estimated range of 
1,000 km, the Nodong-I cannot hit Tokyo. However, all Japanese 
territory, including Okinawa, comes within the range of 1,300 km. 
  At that time, the United States, which had abandoned the 
Strategic Defense Initiative, had been asking Japan for 
assistance in research and development for TMD (Theater Missile 
Defense). 
  "Perhaps, the United States has intentionally estimated the 
range of Nodong-II at 1,300 km as a way to induce Japan to 
cooperate in the defense system by providing funds and 
technology," a senior DA official said, with a sour smile. 
However, as long as Japan has no materials that contradict the 
U.S. intelligence report, it must accept what the United States 
has said as true, for the moment. 
  In 1994, North Korea, an Asian country near Japan, will 
become the focal point in international affairs, being the most 
unstable region of the world. 
  Remaining isolated from the rest of the world, North Korea 
is 
now in a fix due to an oil shortage and food insufficiency. 
Once something happens in this country, Japan will be seriously 
affected. Despite this danger, Japan has no other way but to 
rely on U.S. intelligence. 
<H3>  The Cabinet Information Research Office Is a Small 
Organization Occupying Eight Rooms </H3>
  We cannot but conclude that it is quite natural for Japan to 
depend on the United States, by simply seeing the structure of 
Japanese intelligence services. 
  The Cabinet Information Research Office [CIRO], which is 
often described in fictions as a secret counterintelligence 
service similar to the CIA, is just an organization occupying 
eight rooms on the sixth floor of the small building of the 
Prime Minister's Office. 
  It has a regular staff of 84 people, including drivers, as 
well as officials who have temporarily been transferred from 
other ministries or agencies, such as the National Police Agency 
and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA]. In addition to 
this, 30 officials belonging to other ministries or agencies 
also work for the CIRO. It has an annual budget of 1.835 
billion yen, excluding personnel expenses but including 
administrative expenditures and electronic data processing fees. 
  There is a vast difference between the CIRO and the CIA, 
which has a staff of 22,000 people and an estimated budget of 
some $4 billion (about 400 billion-odd yen), as if the Japanese 
organization were a cat and the U.S. agency a tiger. 
  CIRO is divided into seven departments: General Affairs, 
First Domestic, Second Domestic, First International, Second 
International, Economic, and Archives Departments. The First 
International Department covers each part of the world, while 
the Second International Department analyzes the tone of foreign 
opinion. 
  Some 40 officials are in charge of analyzing regional 
information gathered from newspapers and magazines: two people 
for North and South America, three for Russia, four for China, 
three for North and South Korea, three for Europe, three for 
Asia-Pacific, two for the Middle East and Africa, three for the 
world military situation, and 13 for the world economic 
situation. 
  CIRO can get information from other ministries or agencies, 
thanks to its staff members who originally belong to them. A 
total of 11 organizations are under contract with CIRO to gather 
and provide information. Some of the organizations are: the two 
Japanese news agencies, KYODO NEWS SERVICE and JIJI PRESS; the 
Research Institute of World Politics and Economics, which is 
strong in North Korean affairs; the Southeast Asia Research 
Institute; the Institute for the Study of Democracy; and 
RADIOPRESS. However, what CIRO calls foreign information is 
still a translation or a summary of general news reports. 
  Having only two staff members covering the entire American 
continent, it is hardly thinkable that CIRO is capable of making 
proper information analysis. 
  "At this time, no one can replace one of our experts who 
is going to retire from office. Information-analysis ability 
cannot be acquired immediately. The biggest problem for us is 
how to secure talented men," said CIRO chief Yoshio Omori. 
  Meanwhile, MOFA has set 1990 as the beginning of a new era 
in 
Japanese diplomatic history, because of the end of the Cold War 
following the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989. MOFA, which 
had always adopted diplomacy in line with U.S. foreign policy, 
has begun to take an independent diplomatic attitude in some 
aspects. 
<H5>  MOFA Establishes the Intelligence and Analysis Bureau </H5>
  In August 1993, MOFA established the Foreign Policy Bureau. 
At the same time, it reorganized the Information Analysis, 
Research, and Planning Bureau to create the Intelligence and 
Analysis Bureau. This reorganization shows the ministry's 
willingness to become more independent. 
  Until now, the Information Analysis, Research, and Planning 
Bureau had only two divisions: the Policy Planning Division, in 
charge of general affairs; and the Analysis Division, 
specializing in the Soviet Union, China, and North Korea. Under 
the protection of the U.S. umbrella, the Information Analysis, 
Research, and Planning Bureau had kept its eyes fixed on the 
communist world. This bureau was the symbol of Japanese 
diplomacy during the Cold War era. 
  Following the reorganization aimed at covering all parts of 
the world, the Analysis Division was divided in two: the First 
Analysis Division, covering the United States, Europe, and the 
former Soviet Union; and the Second Analysis Division, dealing 
with Asia, the Pacific, the Middle East, and Africa. 
  However, out of a total staff of 56 men employed by the 
Intelligence and Analysis Bureau, only 22-23 work as analysts at 
the First and Second Analysis Divisions. 
  Their information sources are Japanese embassies and 
consulates. Japanese diplomats themselves receive information 
from U.S. Embassies. They also have a strong tendency to rely 
on judgments made by U.S. Embassies. 
  "It seems that in each country, the U.S. Embassy receives 
information from the CIA. Moreover, U.S. Embassy officials can 
easily make inroads into the other country's information 
sources, because the United States is a superpower. Their 
information is incomparably in-depth. Therefore, we cannot but 
refer to the U.S. Embassy's viewpoint," a MOFA division chief 
said. 
  The U.S. State Department Bureau of Intelligence and 
Research 
has a total staff of some 350 people, and it has access to 
information gathered by other huge intelligence services. 
  A former MOFA information officer even said frankly: 
"Information released by the U.S. State Department is the most 
accurate, while information provided by Japanese private 
citizens is of low reliability." 
  However, foreign countries release information to Japan only 
when it is in line with their national policy or when it does 
not act against their national policy. 
  In his farewell speech, George Washington warned people by 
saying: "Nothing is worse than relying on the simple goodwill 
of a nation toward another nation." 
<H5>  More Than 1,300 Officials Work for the DA "Chobetsu" </H5>
  The DA is capable of gathering information by itself. In 
particular, the Ground Staff Office Intelligence Department 
Special Division has an independent information-gathering 
ability. This division, which goes by the name of "Chobetsu," 
has a total staff of 1,370 men. It has six radio monitoring 
stations in various parts of Japan. It has mainly been 
monitoring the exchange of radio messages by Russia, China, and 
North Korea. Even if it cannot decode their messages, it can 
grasp the variation in communications volume and the change in 
the location of the sending stations, which are substantial 
materials for judgment. 
  Sophisticated codes cannot be used, in particular, in the 
case of radio communications from aircraft. This is why the 
Special Division knew that North Korean pilots have only been 
practicing takeoffs and landings because of a shortage of fuel. 
  In Wakkanai [in the northernmost part of Hokkaido], the Air 
Self-Defense Force has an ELINT station, or electronic 
intelligence station, to monitor radar beams from Russian Air 
Force planes. It is also monitoring the exchange of messages. 
It is able to identify the types of airplanes from the 
frequency and type of radar beam. The ELINT station gained a 
worldwide reputation in September 1983 when a Korean Airline 
jetliner was shot down over Sakhalin. 
  A total of 38 defense attaches have been sent to Japanese 
embassies in 30 countries. The military preparedness of each 
country is grasped by them. However, in any country, it is a 
habit with military authorities to emphasize the threat posed by 
foreign troops, and to remain vague about their weakness, even 
if they are aware of it. This is a way to secure a military 
budget and recruit military personnel. For instance, in 1993, 
the Japanese Defense White Paper wrote: "Modernization of the 
Chinese defense forces is expected to be promoted gradually." 
This is an expression invented by Japanese experts who are 
fully aware that, far from increasing armaments, China can 
hardly modernize them. 
<H3>  The Public Security Investigation Agency Turns Its Eyes to 
Foreign Information </H3>
  The Public Security Investigation Agency [PSIA] has a 
regular 
staff of 1,798 men and an annual budget of 17.1 billion yen. 
Until now, it has been devoted entirely to gathering domestic 
information, with the Japan Communist Party as a target of 
investigation. As the communization of Japan has become almost 
unthinkable following the Soviet Union's collapse, some 
government officials and conservative politicians are now 
saying: "It will serve the best interests of the nation if we 
abolish or scale down the PSIA and if we assign its personnel to 
the task of gathering and analyzing overseas information." 
  The PSIA was renowned for its amazing secrecy. For instance, 
its officials used to never give their namecards to others, even 
to senior officials of other ministries or agencies. 
  However, as it is now facing the question of life or death, 
the PSIA is directing its energies to publicity activities. 
  With a total staff of 149 men, the First Investigation 
Department is divided into four divisions and one office: two 
divisions covering the Japan Communist Party and the other two 
dealing with radical extremists. With a staff of 118 men, the 
Second Investigation Department is divided into three divisions 
and one office: the First Division covering Russia, the Second 
Division covering North Korea, the Third Division dealing with 
rightist organizations, and the International Information Office 
handling information on terrorism in foreign countries. 
  "In 1991, we provided 6,806 items of information to the 
government: 3,670 items were related to international matters, 
including 528 items covering North Korea; 1,744 items were 
related to the Japan Communist Party; 928 items were on 
radicals; and 454 items were on rightists. You see, the amount 
of overseas information is now exceeding that of domestic 
information," said Deputy Director General Makoto Matsuura. He 
stressed his agency's international aspect by giving detailed 
figures. Six agency officials are currently working at Japanese 
diplomatic and consular offices in foreign countries. Several 
others have been sent abroad for study. 
  "We should be able to make an objective analysis, because 
unlike other ministries or agencies, our agency is not bound so 
much to its own interests," Matsuura said. However, we just 
wonder whether its officials, whose exclusive duty was to keep 
an eye on the leftist factions, will be able to make an 
objective analysis and forecast with no ideological bias. It 
will not be so easy for the PSIA to become an international 
intelligence service, if we consider that there will not be many 
officials proficient in foreign languages and well informed of 
the national affairs of countries outside the communist bloc. 
<H3>  The Prime Minister Sometimes Receives Information Gathered 
by the Japan External Trade Organization </H3>
  The National Police Agency and each prefectural police 
office 
have a foreign affairs division in charge of counterespionage. 
Each foreign affairs division is also gathering foreign 
information inside Japan, but the number of police officers 
involved is still kept secret. 
  The Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO), which is 
under 
the jurisdiction of the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry [MITI], has 78 overseas offices in 57 countries. A 
total of 301 officials are stationed abroad. They gather 
economic information, while making efforts to increase Japan's 
purchases of foreign products. 
  Their reports are all based on open information and 
interviews. They are able to get deep information, because they 
have close relations with Japanese-affiliated companies. 
Sometimes such information is directly given to the prime 
minister through MITI. As a matter of course, the JETRO does not 
direct its attention to political and military matters that 
might shake the economy from the bottom up. 
  During the Cold War era, Japan was part of a fleet, with the 
United States as the flagship. She always followed exactly the 
same course taken by the flagship. Although she had neither a 
chief navigator nor a weatherman, she could somehow navigate by 
looking to signals from the flagship. 
  In the past, Japan has been concentrating its energies on 
domestic affairs and economic issues. This history is reflected 
pointedly in the characteristics of Japanese intelligence 
services: they are strong in internal security information as 
well as economic information, while they remain weak in 
international information, especially in information related to 
noncommunist countries.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Revised Points in Political Reform </F>
Bills"] 
  [Text] One cannot deny the feeling that the revisions 
agreed to at the 28 January Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa-Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] President Yohei Kono 
summit on substance of the political reform bills have distorted 
the bills' original intent to establish a political system based 
on the political parties' charaters and policies. This is a 
product of bargaining on interests between the ruling and 
opposition parties. Meanwhile, the first election to be 
conducted under the new system is not likely to come until next 
year even when the revised bills are passed at the next regular 
session of the Diet. 
<H5>  Zone Apportioning </H5>
  At LDP's demand, the number of people to be elected from the 
single-seat districts was raised to 300 while reducing the 
number elected from the proportional representation to 200. The 
outcome will probably mean increased "reflection of popular 
will" and increased "possibility of choosing new government," 
but, for the LDP, this means less likelihood of the incumbent 
Diet members being excluded from hometown constituencies and 
being forced to "run in foreign countries" [constituencies]. 
  As far as the coalition parties are concerned, it is clear 
that they will benefit if they join hands and put up only one 
joint candidate to counter a candidate fielded by the LDP. In 
future, it is possible that political world reorganization 
toward a two-party system will speed up. 
  Once the reform bills are passed by the next regular session 
of the Diet, the focus of attention will shift to the 
apportionment of the single-seat districts. The prime minister 
will recommend seven members to the Electoral District 
Demarcation Review Council, and the members will be formally 
appointed with the approval by the Diet. The Review Council is 
expected to come up with its draft on apportionment of districts 
and to make a recommendation to the government within six 
months. Based on the recommendation, the government will draft 
the "Electoral District Law" and submit it to the regular 
session of the Diet next year. Enactment of the law is not 
likely to come until late next year. 
  When the LDP's Kaifu government prepared its political 
reform 
package, it proposed giving three months for the enforcement of 
the law, but the Ministry of Home Affairs at present thinks such 
educational period is not necessary in view of the six-month 
period the Review Council will have to come up with its draft on 
the district apportionment. All that taken into account, the 
new election system will still not be ready until next year at 
the earliest. 
<H5>  Proportional Representation </H5>
  The system adopted is a product of compromise between the 
government proposal to count proportional representation votes 
with the nation as a single constituency and the LDP proposal to 
count proportional representation votes on a regional basis with 
all metropolis and prefectures as separate blocks. The system 
divides the whole country into 11 blocks, which is the same 
number of blocks recommended by the Eighth Election System 
Review Council in 1990. For the LDP, this is an arrangement 
which enables its members, who will be excluded from single-seat 
districts [and will have to run on the proportional 
representation tickets], to maintain some "ties with their 
regional bases." 
  With the blocks of the proportional representation having 
become smaller in size, larger parties have more to gain than 
smaller parties do. For smaller parties which could have gained 
more seats if votes for the parties had been counted nationally 
as a whole, this arrangment means a tougher hurdle to cross. 
  The anticipated zoning of the 11 blocks and the number of 
seats assigned to them are as follows (based on the 1990 
recommendation by the Eighth Election System Review Council): 
  Hokkaido = 9; Tohoku covering Aomori, Iwate, Miyagi, Akida, 
Yamagata, and Fukushima prefectures = 16; Kita-Kanto covering 
Ibaraki, Tochiki, Gunma, and Saitama prefectures = 21; 
Minami-Kanto covering Chiba, Kanagawa, and Yamanashi prefectures 
= 23; Tokyo = 19; Hokuriku-Shinetsu covering Niigata, Toyama, 
Ishikawa, Fukui, and Nagano prefectures = 13; Tokai covering 
Gifu, Shizuoka, Aichi, and Mie prefectures = 23; Kinki covering 
Shiga, Kyoto, Osaka, Hyogo, Nara, and Wakayama prefectures = 33; 
Chukoku covering Tottori, Shimane, Okayama, Hiroshima, and 
Yamaguchi prefectures = 13; Shikoku covering Kagawa, Tokushima, 
Ehime, and Kochi prefectures = 7; Kyushu covering Fukuoka, Saga, 
Nagasaki, Kumamoto, Oita, Miyazaki, Kagoshima, and Okinawa 
prefectures = 23. 
<H5>  Corporate Donations </H5>
  While the original government-proposed bills sought to ban 
donations by corporations and business organizations to 
politician- representing agencies, the revision will allow each 
politician to designate one political agency to receive such 
corporate donations -- up to 500,000 yen a year -- even though 
all donations of more than 50,000 yen (at present, 1 million 
yen) will be required to be made public. It can be said that 
some progress has been made where transparancy of political 
funds is concerned. 
  But there are said to be some "loopholes." For instance, if 
the names of existing politician supporting groups [goenkai] are 
changed into chapters of party youth departments or women's 
departments, these groups can continue to receive corporate 
donations. "Donations with strings attached" -- donations to 
political parties, specifying the politicians to receive the 
donations -- are also thought to be possible as are under the 
current law. 
<H5>  Public Subsidies for Parties </H5>
  While it may be something the two top leaders did not 
intend, 
some new problems are arising with respect to the bills -- from 
the perspective of the spirit of, and compatibility with, law. 
One of them is that the justification for collecting public 
subsidies of 250 yen per head nationally -- or a total of 30.9 
billion yen -- has become even more ambiguous than before. The 
government initially justified the collectiion of the subsidies, 
saying they will "take place of corporate donations." But now 
that corporate donations of up to a certain amount have been 
admitted, it is likely that demands for lowering the subsidies 
will rise. 
  On the other hand, because vote counting in the proportional 
representation will be done on a regional basis, it will become 
difficult for small existing parties and newly formed parties to 
get their people elected. Consequently, it is likely that 
demands on revising the "impediment clauses" -- providing 
qualifications for political parties and requiring candidates to 
deposit 3 to 6 million yen in security [with the government] in 
order to prevent many splinter parties from arising -- will 
arise as well.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Turbulence Accelerated by Political Reform"] </F>
  [Text] The 135-day-long 128th Extraordinary Session of the 
Diet, which has been called the "political reform Diet," closed 
after taking a myriad of twists and turns and even dropping an 
undesirable precedent in the end. 
  What has been notable in the political reform debates that 
have continued to go astray and remain disorderly for over five 
years is the turmoil in the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and 
the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]. The underlying 
cause of this turmoil can be attributed to the irresponsible 
manner in which the two parties handled matters ever since the 
issue of political reform surfaced. In the case of the LDP, the 
party has shown a lack of consistency as it first started off 
with a plan to introduce an electoral system combining 
single-seat constituencies with proportional representation, 
called the "heiritsu" system, switching over to a plan to 
introduce a system with only single-seat constituencies during 
the administration of former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, 
only to revert to the original plan during the current Diet 
session. 
  Probably, the real intentions of many LDP members are that 
"regarding political reform, the party is merely posing to 
appeal to public opinion and it really wants to maintain the 
current medium-size constituency system and continue receiving 
corporate donations." They also cannot help but admit that they 
have put together electoral reform and prevention of political 
graft as a single package to camouflage such intentions. Such 
is their insincerity that complicated the issue to such an 
extent. 
<H5>  The LDP and SDPJ Have Failed To Serve Their Purpose </H5>
  The SDPJ has also been irresponsible regarding unifying 
differing opinions within itself. At the time when Makoto 
Tanabe served as SDPJ chairman, the party decided for the first 
time to adopt as its own plan the "heiyo" formula, an electoral 
system similar to that adopted in Germany which combines 
proportional representation with single-seat constituencies. 
However, the party failed to hold sufficient intraparty debate 
on the issue. Later, under the leadership of Sadao Yamahana, 
who succeeded Tanabe as SDPJ chairman, the party decided to 
change from the heiyo to the "renyo" formula [another electoral 
system proposed by a private council on political reform that 
combines single-seat constituencies with proportional 
representation], only to switch to the heiritsu system. In this 
way, the party has continued to act incoherently. 
  Such lack of principle has forced the party to repeatedly 
make last-minute concessions. For example, it has had to agree 
to increase the number of single-seat constituencies from its 
originally proposed 250 to 274, then to 280, and finally to 300. 
The party has joined the coalition alliance on the condition 
that it would accept the heiritsu formula. This has resulted in 
adding fuel to intraparty conflicts. Nevertheless, the price 
the party has to pay for the lack of sufficient intraparty 
debate has shown up as mass dissension in the upper house. 
  Honestly speaking, we must say that from the turmoil seen in 
both the LDP and the SDPJ during the current Diet session, the 
two parties are no longer serving their purpose as political 
parties. Even at the plenary sessions of both house of the Diet 
on the last day of the current session, dissatisfied members of 
both parties acted against their parties' decisions. Dissident 
upper house SDPJ members have set up a "Dietmen's group to hold 
informal talks on preventing political corruption," which 
strongly indicates the formation of a separate party within the 
party. 
  We feel that if LDP and SDPJ members pretend to stay under 
their respective roofs, at least in form, they are trying to 
deceive the voters. 
  The LDP was shocked when it was reported during the current 
Diet session that Michio Watanabe, one of the LDP strongmen, 
planned to leave the party. For that matter, we suggest the LDP 
take this opportunity to split into three groups: the Watanabe 
faction, pro-electoral-reformists, and those advocating taking a 
cautious stance on electoral reform. The SDPJ, too, should 
refreshen itself by splitting into two groups. 
<H5>  The Broken Walls Between Political Parties </H5>
  The SDPJ is the largest among the coalition parties. Should 
the SDPJ split up, it would be a threat to the Hosokawa 
administration. However, even SDPJ dissidents do not want to see 
the LDP regain power. As long as the Hosokawa administration 
continues its public-opinion-oriented politics, there should be 
sufficient room to hope these dissidents may provide support to 
the government from outside the cabinet or take a neutral, but 
friendly stance. 
  The underlying cause of turmoil in the current Diet 
session originates with the split in the LDP which occurred when 
a no-confidence motion against former Prime Minister Miyazawa 
was passed at the ordinary Diet session last June because LDP 
dissidents voted in favor of the motion. A general election was 
then held in July with new conservative parties making rapid 
advances, while the LDP and SDPJ suffered major setbacks. This 
was then followed by a crop of dissidents from the LDP and SDPJ 
who were dissatisfied with their parties' decisions on the 
political reform bills. 
  Such repeated occurrence of cross-voting indicates that 
walls 
dividing political parties regarding ideologies and policies 
have now begun to crumble. The greatest contributing factor to 
bringing about this situation is the end of the Cold War and the 
collapse of the former Soviet Union. However, it can be said 
that structural changes in politics have converged not because 
of policy issues, but rather because of issues directly linked 
to the interests of individual Dietmen. 
  Thinking in such terms, we can say that it was an inevitable 
phenomenon to see that the LDP and the SDPJ, which have served 
fixed roles as the ruling and opposition parties, respectively, 
under the Cold War structure, can no longer hold themselves 
together as political parties. To change the traditional 
political system under which the LDP and SDPJ played the main 
roles -- known as the "55-year structure" -- so that it can meet 
the needs of the times, the two parties must inevitably fall 
apart and regroup. 
  Should the two parties split, it means there will continue 
to 
be a formation of a myriad of small political parties for some 
time to come. There may undoubtedly be political turmoil and 
instability. However, there is no need to magnify such problems 
out of proportion as long as there can be established a basic 
principle under which the nation can readily respond to 
international problems. This is a price the people must pay to 
establish a new political system. 
<H3>  Pending Issues in Act III of the Regrouping of Political 
Parties </H3>
  Act I of the regrouping of political parties has already 
been 
staged with the LDP's split and the subsequent general election 
last year. The coalition government's formation and the 
confusion over the political reform bills constitute Act II, so 
to speak. In view of the implementation of a new electoral 
system, we should now expect to see political parties allying 
with each other, while individual politicians and would-be 
Dietmen look for parties they want to join. 
  In Act III, what is important is for parties to clarify 
policies and assertions under which they plan to assemble and 
embark on the process of regrouping. Among both ruling and 
opposition parties, there currently exists a "corrupt" situation 
where a mixed group of politicians who hold differing views on 
ideologies and policies belong to the same parties. To resolve 
this problem and provide voters with options which are easily 
understandable is an important task in Act III. 
  Should the political reform bills actually be implemented, 
the process of regrouping of political parties would be sharply 
accelerated. According to the new laws, political parties will 
receive public funds equivalent to each individual Japanese 
paying 250 yen. This brings up an issue in which voters would 
be linked to politics in a new way. It is only natural for each 
individual Japanese citizen to have great interest in the issue 
of how the political system should be reorganized. 
  We have urged that "results be made on political reform no 
matter what it takes during the current Diet session." Now that 
the issue has been settled for the time being, we feel it 
satisfactory that our hopes have been fulfilled. 
  When the political reform bills were put up for vote in the 
upper house, we urged that there be no fear about expected 
changes and that they be tentatively approved, although there 
still were many problems with the bills. However, the bills 
were rejected. Moreover, there was not much to be hoped for in 
the negotiations by the joint committee of both houses. Under 
such circumstances, lower house speaker Takako Doi and upper 
house speaker Bunbe Hara were called to help break the 
deadlocked situation. We praise the fact that, in the end, 
their efforts have been realized. 
  However, doubts have been left as to how last-minute 
agreements were forged; that is, there are concerns that the 
fact that the bills should suddenly be revived in the form of 
agreements which differ in content from what was put up to a 
vote in both houses of the Diet -- even though this was done 
under mutual agreement between the ruling and opposition parties 
-- may set a bad precedent regarding future Diet steering. 
<H5>  "Turnaround Agreement" Should Be Treated With Caution </H5>
  The gist of the accord, reached through a top-level meeting 
between Prime Minister Hosokawa and LDP President Yohei Kono, 
includes the revival of key points of the LDP-proposed political 
reform bills which were rejected at the lower house plenary 
session. It has been decided that the number of seats in the 
single-seat constituencies would be increased to 300, and a 
fund-raising body would be designated to accept corporate 
donations to individual politicians. Thus, placing priority on 
having the bills enacted has resulted in having to agree to 
almost "swallow" LDP demands "in whole." 
  At the beginning of the ceremony to sign the accord on the 
political reform bills, Hosokawa and Kono said: "We came to 
agreement on the understanding that an unhealable scar would be 
left on parliamentary democracy unless the political reform 
bills are enacted." Apparently, they have given consideration 
to public opinion which urged settlement during the current Diet 
session no matter what it takes. However, it cannot be ruled 
out that such a high-handed manner of forging agreements will 
not become a malpractice and be applied to other issues. We 
would like to point this out for the sake of the development of 
healthy parliamentary politics. 
  Ms. Doi, who acted as a mediator between Hosokawa and Kono, 
has been generally acknowledged as an adamant supporter of the 
Constitution. However, since this issue concerns the basic 
principles of Diet steering, Ms. Doi should clarify her views 
when she finds a chance to do so. Fortunately, there still is 
opportunity to conduct deliberations on the date of implementing 
the political reform bills at the upcoming ordinary Diet 
session. It is hoped the Diet will be able to resolve such 
apprehensions.

  [Interview with Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary 
and representative of Sakigake (Harbinger) -- place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How will Diet enactment of a 
political reform bill package change the political world? 
  [Takemura] Politicians, as well as political parties, will 
make a new start with a feeling of uncertainty. If they fail to 
take a careful look at a new political system and discuss ways 
to embrace the new political system, they will place their 
interests ahead of the new political system, leaving the system 
distorted. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Will the political parties lead 
future elections? 
  [Takemura] Contesting among candidates from the same party 
in 
single-seat constituencies will disappear. Although the 
conservative-reformist structure will disappear, there will be a 
situation wherein conservative candidates with their different 
party affiliation fight each other in elections. Their fight in 
elections will create a complex situation. In future elections 
in which party affiliation and party platform are regarded as 
important factors, only one candidate will be chosen in a 
single-seat constituency and voters will be given more room than 
now to study "their choice" in elections. I believe it is 
highly possible that personal ties, acquaintances, and the 
conventional support groups will remain intact. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] There is talk that ruling coalition 
parties will field unified candidates in future elections and a 
new party will be formed. How would you respond to this 
prospect? 
  [Takemura] I do not know. Frankly speaking, what I am 
vaguely assuming is that in principle, there should be moves 
toward a realignment of the established political parties, 
including the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. In the 
course of realigning the established political parties, we need 
to closely watch how they would split in the future. They might 
split into two, three, or four parties or groups. 
  It is a principle that the established political parties 
should be realigned not by an agreement reached between party 
leaders and party interests, but by party platforms, policies, 
and ideologies. I think that in elections, voters will choose 
their candidates taking into account how the parties are run and 
how the parties handle personnel affairs and money. If parties 
with different policy platforms merge, their merger would run 
into contradiction. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Then, will it not be possible for 
Shinseito [the Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito to merge? 
  [Takemura] The two parties have shared each other's 
hardships for half a year and they now feel friendly toward each 
other. They aim for reform and share many aspects unlike other 
parties that are complacent about the old political system. 
Nonetheless, they have many different aspects because of the 
history of their growth. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Will the political parties start 
their second realignment when the demarcation of single-seat 
constituencies is completed? 
  [Takemura] Yes, they will move toward realignment at that 
time. The political parties will make brisk moves toward 
realignment after this summer when the Diet passes a bill on the 
demarcation. Although Sakigake is in a position to shore up the 
Hosokawa government, if it fails to keep pace with moves that 
other parties make in response to a new electoral system, it 
would face a contradiction. Any discord within the ruling 
coalition parties would weaken the coalition government's 
foundation and there are very difficult aspects. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Prime minister special assistant 
Tanaka has resigned. Did the prime minister dismiss him? 
  [Takemura] The prime minister did not dismiss him at all. I 
have heard some people say Mr. Tanaka has fled from the prime 
minister, but Mr. Hosokawa absolutely did not dismiss him. At 
the same time, Mr. Tanaka has not fled from the prime minister. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do the prime minister and you have 
any disagreement over merging Sakigake and the New Japan Party? 
  [Takemura] I believe that there is no change in our feelings 
toward merging the two parties. As for the question of how and 
when the two parties should be merged, its interpretation has 
been varied by us. I and the prime minister have decided to 
merge our two parties and announced our decision. Our two 
parties have played an active part in the Diet as a unified 
group for half a year. Our understanding is that conditions 
have been created everyday wherein the two parties can be 
merged. We intend to merge our parties without failing to seize 
a good opportunity. 
  [Takemura] It has been reported that you have been feuding 
with Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa. 
  [Takemura] There has been no feud between us at all. I have 
never publicly criticized Mr. Ozawa or spoken against him. The 
differences between our blueprints for Japan's future and in our 
ways of getting things done have prompted such a report. It is 
all my fault. 
  (NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP] has managed to avoid another split. What do you 
think of moves by a reformist group led by LDP Deputy Secretary 
General Masayasu Kitakawa? 
  [Takemura] Our Parliamentary Dormitory rooms are next door 
to each other and, in the past, we belonged to the same LDP 
faction. Mr. Kitakawa is a politician I know very well. I 
believe that we have maintained a good private and official 
relationship. I hope that as a reformist, he will play an 
active part in the LDP. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you not hope that he will break 
away from the LDP? 
  [Takemura] I think that he will probably do so some time in 
the future. I think that he is one of my most credible 
colleagues.

<F P=106> [Article by Takuro Naka, journalist: "`Reason' and `Emotion' </F>
Entwined Ozawa's Glittering Human Connections"] 
  [Text] He Had Begged: "I Would Appreciate Your 
Cooperation, Mr. Yamagishi" 
  The words, "praise and criticism," seem to exist for Ichiro 
Ozawa. From the breakup of the Takeshita faction of the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] in 1992 to the birth of the non-LDP 
coalition cabinet, the entire political world was divided into 
the "pro- and anti-Ozawa" groups. Questioned on whether to 
accept or reject the "Ozawa-style politics," it has gone through 
a sieve and moved forward to restructuring. 
  Political reporters, who also act as political movers, were 
divided into two camps as well. A copy desk editor at a national 
newspaper says, "Depending on whether the politician to be 
interviewed was for or against Ozawa, our people at the 
political desk were clearly divided into two groups. We had 
heated arguments every day on how to evaluate Ozawa's speech and 
action." 
  Here lie Ozawa's unique connections with people and the 
strong awareness of his existence as a politician. A bureaucrat 
who is considered as a close associate of Ozawa looks at the 
praise and criticism of Ozawa: "Members of the LDP criticize his 
aggressive methods for being undemocratic. But that misses the 
point because no one speaks as straightforwardly as Mr. Ozawa. 
For example, he even tells us bureaucrats that one government is 
enough, and that he will eventually have to fight with us for 
political reform. If you want to follow Mr. Ozawa, you will have 
to accept what he says, and if not, you will oppose him 
completely." 
  Notwithstanding his straightforwardness, Ozawa sometimes 
assumes an extremely reverent posture toward his seniors, 
especially those whom he respects. Although he talks haughtily 
to the politicians and newspaper reporters who are junior to 
him, more often than not he addresses his seniors politely as 
"Mr. so and so," even if they are Dietmen of the ranks lower 
than him. 
  There is a famous anecdote. Former Prime Minister Kakuei 
Tanaka, who had been arrested by the Tokyo District Public 
Prosecutor's Office in 1976 in conjunction with the Lockheed 
payoff scandal, was released on bail and staying at home in 
Mejirodai, with nothing to do. During that time, a young Dietman 
visited Tanaka almost every day to play his favorite game of 
Japanese chess. That was Ozawa; he was 34 then. 
  Ozawa was born in 1942, the same year as Tanaka's eldest 
son, who died at a young age. Tanaka entered the political world 
when he was 26 and took care of Ozawa dearly from the time he 
joined the Tanaka faction. He even thought of marrying his 
eldest daughter, Makiko, to Ozawa, who was two years older than 
she. It's not difficult to imagine how fondly he thought of 
Ozawa, who came every day to play Japanese chess quietly with 
him, now an accused in the criminal case. 
  Capturing Tanaka's heart was the beginning of Ozawa's human 
networking, both in terms of quality and quantity. Soon 
afterward, Ozawa began to distinguish himself quickly within the 
Tanaka faction and the LDP. Then, after leaving Tanaka and 
forming the Takeshita faction, he became favored by the new don, 
Shin Kanemaru. He captured the number-three position under 
Noboru Takeshita, the head of the faction, and Kanemaru. 
  Ozawa began his own political career, surrounded by his 
colleagues in the Diet, secretaries, and supporters, all of whom 
were his seniors. His "charming the elders" method, which was 
used on Tanaka and Kanemaru, is his learned way of success in 
life. He has also used this method in developing strong 
connections outside the political world. 
  In the spring of 1993, Ozawa had a meeting with Akira 
Yamagishi, chairman of the Rengo [National Confederation of 
Trade Unions]. Reportedly, he sat formerly on the tatami floor 
and then lowered his head reverently over his hands placed on 
the floor in front of him, saying, "Mr. Yamagishi, I would 
appreciate your cooperation" in political reform and 
restructuring of the political world. Impressed by this gesture, 
Yamagishi, who had been suspicious of Ozawa's tactics, became an 
Ozawa sympathizer. Then, after the election for the House of 
Representatives in July, he kept his promise by exercising his 
influence in having the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] 
join the coalition government. 
<H3>  Mobilizing Money and People in the Business, Labor, and 
Religious Circles </H3>
  In the business world, he is also well trusted by Gaishi 
Hiraiwa, chairman of Keidanren, and Masaya Miyoshi, its 
secretary general. The reason for Keidanren's curtailment of 
political contributions to the LDP seems to rest not only on the 
public criticism against the corruptive relationship between 
politicians and industries, such as in the case of general 
contractors, but also on leading businessmen's expectations for 
Ozawa on restructuring of the political world. 
  Furthermore, in the religious world, Ozawa is reported to 
have a strong connection with Taisaku Ikeda, honorary chairman 
of Soka Gakkai. Originally, according to some sources, Ikeda had 
connections in the political world through Noboru Takeshita. 
However, Ozawa approached Ikeda, reportedly through a leading 
member of Soka Gakkai who acts as a pipeline between his 
organization and Komeito. 
  Ozawa has Komeito involved in the movement for political 
restructuring; he even made Komeito's general secretary (Yuichi 
Ichikawa) say, "I don't even mind losing our party's identity." 
This is not only because Ozawa has a good relationship with 
Ichikawa, but also because he has already obtained Ikeda's 
virtual approval. 
  By developing close relationships with Tanaka and Kanemaru, 
the former dons of the political world, as well as with the 
leading figures in the business, labor, and religious worlds who 
can mobilize a large amount of money and people, Ozawa has 
created the man he is today. 
  Also in the mass media, he was favored by the late Osamu 
Togawa, who was quite influential in the political world. He 
used this connection to build his network in various circles. 
  Ozawa served once as minister of home affairs, his only 
experience as a cabinet member. But, as he was a central figure 
within the LDP, serving as its secretary general and was a 
deputy cabinet secretary for the Takeshita administration, he 
has a wide array of connections in the ministries and agencies 
in Kasumigaseki. 
  There are many "Ozawa sympathizers" among the bureaucrats in 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA], especially because he 
was involved in the Japan-U.S. construction talks when he was a 
deputy cabinet secretary, and also as a secretary general of the 
LDP, he was involved in formulating Japan's response to the Gulf 
war and in drawing up the UN Peacekeeping Cooperation Law. He 
seems to have cultivated these human contacts through "reason," 
while he used "emotion" to get hold of the hearts of Yamagishi 
and other leading figures in various circles. 
  His leading protege [within MOFA] is Minoru Tanba, the 
current director of the Treaties Bureau. During the Kaifu 
administration, he was promoted to director of the UN Bureau, 
replacing the former director who had made a series of mistakes 
in replying to interpellation in the Diet on an international 
peacekeeping cooperation bill (rejected). Since then, he worked 
as Ozawa's right-hand man in drafting the UN Peacekeeping 
Cooperation Bill. He is considered to be MOFA's most persuasive 
speaker and is also an adviser to Ozawa. 
  Another leading protege is Michihiko Kunihiro, the current 
ambassador to China, who headed a cabinet-level committee on 
foreign affairs when Ozawa was deputy cabinet secretary, and was 
involved in the Japan-U.S. construction talks along with Ozawa. 
He joined the MOFA in the same year as Hisashi Owada, who 
retired from his position as vice minister. Although he lost the 
battle with Owada in becoming a MOFA vice minister, he 
successively held such important posts as counselor on foreign 
affairs, ambassador to Indonesia, and ambassador to China. He is 
also a member of Ozawa's brain trust. 
  There are also some young MOFA bureaucrats who are devoted 
to 
Ozawa and are willing to volunteer as interpreters whenever 
Ozawa receives prominent individuals from foreign countries. 
  Also, Yukio Okamoto -- who resigned from MOFA when he was 
head of the First Section of North American Affairs and is 
currently a consultant on foreign affairs -- is considered as a 
close associate of Ozawa. 
  Another individual is Nobuo Matsunaga, the don of MOFA and 
former ambassador to the United States, who is now an adviser to 
MOFA. He is close to Yasuhiro Nakasone and thus is not 
considered quite a member of Ozawa's brain trust. However, he 
serves as chairman of the "John Manjiro Historical Group" of 
which Ozawa is the de facto sponsor. 
  The group's purpose is to promote friendly relations between 
Japan and the United States in memory of Manjiro Nakahama, who 
went to the United States as a castaway toward the end of the 
Edo period and devoted much labor to serve as a mediator between 
Japan and the United States in the Meiji period. The one who 
played a most active part in creating the group was Sadao 
Hirano, a Dietman in the House of Councilors, who is from Kochi 
Prefecture as was Manjiro and is considered to be Ozawa's most 
trusted friend. The group was "created to expand Mr. Ozawa's 
horizon and people contacts" (per a member of the group). In 
fact, Ozawa has been cultivating his contacts through this 
group. 
  For example, the group's directors include Takaya Sugiura, 
chairman of All Nippon Airways; Hitoshi Kojima, president of 
NTT; and Minoru Makihara, president of Mitsubishi Corporation. 
Ozawa seems to have regular meetings with them. 
  Moreover, he is "on good terms" with Michael Armacost, the 
former U.S. ambassador to Japan during the Bush administration; 
he has had a number of meetings with him every month since he 
was LDP general secretary. Also, Richard Chaney, the former 
defense secretary, and Walter Mondale, the current U.S. 
ambassador to Japan, are scheduled to speak at a meeting of the 
"John Manjiro Historical Group," which is to be held in Tokyo 
in the near future. They also seem to have strong relationships 
with Ozawa. 
  His Book, Blueprint for Building a New 
Japan, and Brains Behind It 
  Additionally, in the political world he has Nobuo Ishihara, 
the deputy cabinet secretary (for administration), who reigns 
over the bureaucratic organizations. He was the vice minister at 
the Ministry of Home Affairs when Ozawa was the minister. When 
the Takeshita administration took power in 1987, Ozawa became 
deputy cabinet secretary (for political affairs) and installed 
Ishihara as deputy cabinet secretary for administration. Since 
then, Ishihara has served five successive prime ministers -- 
Takeshita, Uno, Kaifu, Miyazawa, and Hosokawa. 
  Although Ishihara tries to maintain a neutral stance on 
political affairs, he is hawkish like Ozawa, upholding his 
principles. Therefore, former prime ministers Kaifu and Miyazawa 
disliked his Ozawa-like qualities, and tried to get rid of him 
by making him governor of Tokyo or changing his post. However, 
as Ishihara is a capable public servant who knows the 
bureaucratic structure well, and can't be replaced by anyone, he 
has been a deputy cabinet secretary for the longest period of 
time in history. He plays the role of Ozawa's outpost within the 
cabinet. 
  Norihiko Narita, who is known as an expert on political 
reform, especially on electoral systems, left his post as 
section chief at the National Diet Library to become the head 
secretary (on political affairs) for Prime Minister Hosokawa. He 
has also become a member of Ozawa's brain trust through Hirano 
on the political reform issue. 
  A system of single-seat constituency and proportional 
representation was based on Narita's idea -- in the midst of 
debate on political reform during the ordinary session of the 
Diet, it was proposed by the Private Political Reform Promotion 
Council (Private Ad Hoc Council on Political Reform) as a 
compromise between the leading and opposition parties' 
proposals. Some people stipulate that Prime Minister Miyazawa 
and the LDP members didn't want to support the proposal readily 
because they felt that Ozawa was behind it. 
  Now, let's look at organized labor, which played a major 
role 
in forming the coalition government. 
  Here, as mentioned earlier, the main driving force has been 
Akira Yamagishi, the don of organized labor, who became an Ozawa 
sympathizer. But even before him, some young labor 
leaders--including Etsuya Washio, chairman of the Japanese 
Federation of Iron and Steel Workers' Unions; Teruhito Enomoto, 
chairman of the Confederation of Japan Automobile Workers' 
Unions; and Hisaji Sonoki, vice chairman of Rengo--have been 
involved in political reform through their participation in the 
Private Ad Hoc Council on Political Reform. They also had 
several meetings with Ozawa and are in agreement with his stance 
on political reform. 
  A unique individual in Ozawa's connections in organized 
labor 
is Masamitsu Shirojima (chairman of the labor union at 
Ajinomoto), chairman of the Council of the Food Industry 
Workers' Unions. He is known to be conducting his own political 
activities; he formed a fraternal organization for new labor 
leaders called "Shunju-kai" and has been actively cultivating 
relationships with Dietmen from Komeito. He met Ozawa through 
Yoshihisa Inoue, former Dietman in the House of Representatives, 
and other members of Komeito. He is now like a brain for Ozawa 
in the organized labor sector, inviting the people close to 
Ozawa in the mass media to speak at various gatherings of 
corporate executives in the food industry. 
  In the business world, in addition to such aforementioned 
people as Hiraiwa, Miyoshi, and the members of the "John 
Manjiro Historical Group," Ozawa seems to be well connected to 
the top executives of the Mitsubishi group and the Toyota group 
companies, including Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota Motor 
Corporation. 
  Aside from these politically charged connections, Ozawa is 
rumored to have a group of intellectuals on his side. The rumor 
came about because of his best-selling book, Blueprint for 
Building a New Japan [Nihon Kaizo Keikaku], which has been 
reviewed quite favorably. 
  A scholar on foreign affairs says, "At least on the issue of 
foreign affairs, the content of the book has enough substance 
for us to read. As I heard, the book was written mostly by Mr. 
Ozawa, but it seems to me a summary of discussions from some 
research studies. He must have a group of scholars [who helped 
him write the book] although I'm not one of them." In fact, the 
book has been talked about a lot lately in the academic world. 
  Ozawa doesn't disclose the existence of such a group of 
scholars, probably to protect their status in the academic 
world. According to the consensus of opinion, however, the chief 
scholar is Shinichi Kitaoka, professor at Rikkyo University, who 
is building his popularity recently as a political scientist. 
According to some people (in the academic world), "Mr. Ozawa 
seems to have a desire to develop this kind of young scholar." 
Takeshi Sasaki, professor of political science at Tokyo 
University, who appears frequently on TV, also often exchanges 
opinions with Ozawa on the issue of political reform. 
  Regarding the issue of the Constitution, Setsu Kobayashi, 
professor at Keio University, who supports constitutional 
reform, served as an advisor to Ozawa and spoke at a meeting of 
the "Research Committee on Japan's Role in the International 
Community" (the so-called Ozawa Committee), which was 
established within the LDP in 1991. Kenichi Ito, professor at 
Aoyama Gakuin University, also seems to have some contact with 
Ozawa in the area of political reform and foreign policy issues, 
although he can't be considered as a member of Ozawa's brain 
trust. 
  In the mass media, Ikki Kasuya , chief editor of GAIKO 
FORUM, 
is supposedly acting as a coordinator between Ozawa and these 
scholars. Also, Kenzo Uchida, professor at Tokai University and 
former editor in chief at KYODO News, and commentator Taro 
Okuyama, have the same line of thinking as Ozawa in promoting 
political reform. 
<H5>  Foreign Minister Hata Is Ozawa's Close Friend </H5>
  Let's now turn to the political world, Ozawa's home ground. 
  Ozawa entered the political world when he was 26, soon after 
the death of his father, Saeki Ozawa, who had served as 
construction minister, among others. Saeki was a member of the 
Fujiyama faction of the LDP, and one of his colleagues in the 
faction was Masumi Ezaki, former vice premier, who just retired 
at the time of election for the House of Representatives in 
July. Ezaki, who had left the Fujiyama faction and joined the 
Tanaka faction, acted like a legal guardian for Ozawa. 
  As if to return favors he received in the past, Ozawa had 
Ezaki's fourth son, Tetsuma, run for election as a candidate 
from his own party, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. Toshihiro 
Nikai, who entered the political world after having served as 
Ezaki's secretary, also joined Shinseito and has become one of 
Ozawa's trusted young associates. Ezaki is an important 
connection for Ozawa although he chose a separate way when the 
Takeshita faction was formed. 
  It is a well-known fact that Ozawa's wife, Kazuko, is a 
daughter of the president of Fukuda-gumi in Niigata, who was a 
financial supporter of Kakuei Tanaka. Through this marriage, 
Ozawa not only strengthened his relationship with Tanaka, but 
also formed a new bond with Noboru Takeshita -- they became 
distant relatives when a sister of Ozawa's wife was married to 
Takeshita's brother, Meguru. 
  Second-generation Dietmen are also important among Ozawa's 
political associates. Soon after he was elected as a Dietman for 
the first time, Ozawa began to cultivate friendships with those 
young Dietmen who are second- generation politicians as he is. 
He probably felt close to them because they were in the same age 
group and hadn't been affected by local politicking. 
  These Dietmen include Tsutomu Hata, Ryutaro Hashimoto, and 
Keizo Obuchi, all from the Tanaka faction, and Toshio Yamaguchi 
and Koichi Kato from other factions. Hata is a contemporary of 
Ozawa; Hashimoto and Obuchi are two terms senior; Yamaguchi is 
one term senior; and Kato is one term junior to Ozawa. 
  Hata, Hashimoto, and Obuchi were Ozawa's "comrades" when the 
Takeshita faction was formed from the Tanaka faction. At the 
time of the breakup of the Takeshita faction at the end of 
1992, Ozawa acted together with Hata, but fought and parted with 
Hashimoto and Obuchi. Hata and Ozawa won their first election 
campaign in 1992 and became cabinet members for the first time 
in the same year. Although they are rivals, they are close 
friends, calling each other as "It-chan" and "Tsutomu-chan." 
  Yamaguchi formed the Shinjiyu Club [New Liberal Club], and 
had been distant from Ozawa and the others. But suddenly, he 
became close to Ozawa again when Ozawa was secretary general of 
the LDP. At some point, he used to frequent and stay in the 
secretary general's office. Then, during the vote of 
no-confidence in the Miyazawa cabinet during a plenary session 
of the House of Representatives that prompted Ozawa and others 
to form Shinseito, he voted for no-confidence and left the LDP. 
Although he doesn't belong to any political party at present, 
rumors strongly suggest that he will join Shinseito in the near 
future. 
  On the other hand, Kato and Ozawa used to be good friends 
until a few years ago, writing each other's name in the 
friendship column of a political news magazine. But they parted 
with each other because Kato became a member of the 
anti-political reform and anti-Takeshita faction group in order 
to back Miyazawa. At one point, Ozawa even tried to approach 
Yohei Kono, who was Kato's rival within the Miyazawa faction. 
  Aside from the second-generation Dietmen, Ozawa is on good 
terms with three of the so-called seven magistrates of the 
Takeshita faction -- Seiroku Kajiyama, Kozo Watanabe, and Keiwa 
Okuda. Although he joined the effort to form the Takeshita 
faction rather late, Okuda quickly became close to Kanemaru and 
Ozawa. Since then, he was one of the first to advocate 
restructuring of the political world, and when Shinseito was 
formed in July he spoke up strongly for leaving the LDP and 
joining Shinseito. He is the foremost supporter of the Ozawa 
line in the party. Watanabe has also been an Ozawa sympathizer 
for a long time. He and Ozawa share the same birthday, with a 
10-year difference in age, and have thrown a joint birthday 
party every year. 
  Among the young Dietmen from Shinseito, four individuals -- 
Hajime Funada, Keisuke Nakanishi, Hiroshi Kumagai, and Toshiro 
Nikai -- are highly regarded as Ozawa's close associates. Funada 
served as the director of the Ozawa Committee. Since then, he 
has been close to Ozawa and frequently appears on TV as a 
substitute for Ozawa. 
<H5>  Upholding His Principle for Human Relations </H5>
  Nakanishi and Kumagai play the roles of "Suke-san and 
Kaku-san" [trusted assistants who served Lord Komon Mito during 
the Edo period]. Having served as deputy secretary general under 
LDP secretary general Ozawa, Nakanishi is like a leader of 
Ozawa's action corps. Kumagai, a former bureaucrat at the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry, has been acting as 
Ozawa's right-hand man in foreign affairs, accompanying Ozawa on 
his trips to the former Soviet Union and other countries or 
preparing for his visits beforehand in these countries. 
  A close associate of Ozawa worth special mention here is 
Sadao Hirano, a Dietman in the House of Councilors. He served as 
secretary to Shigesaburo Maeo, former speaker of the House of 
Representatives, and as a house committee chairman. He has been 
a friend of Ozawa since Ozawa was chairman of the Committee on 
Rules and Administration. He is said to be well informed of 
stories behind the stories in the political world as well as 
political machinations, and as such he is the best source of 
information for Ozawa on everything from how to handle 
legislative proposals to political reform. As mentioned earlier, 
he is the one who created the "John Manjiro Historical Group." 
  One of the main characteristics of Ozawa's human relations 
is 
that he has many strong sympathizers outside his own political 
party and faction. Especially famous is his close friendship 
with Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito, and Takeshi 
Yonezawa, general secretary of the Democratic Socialist Party. 
They not only play pivotal roles in the coalition government, 
but also form the center of the stormy movement toward political 
restructuring--they are trying to develop a group of unified 
candidates to create a new New Party. 
  Ozawa's friendship with Ichikawa and Yonezawa originates in 
spring 1992 when they had heated discussions night after night 
on the issue of additional financial aid in the amount of $9 
billion for the Gulf war -- they eventually materialized this 
additional aid. They are good friends, enjoying singing 
occasionally at Karaoke bars. This is a typical example of 
Ozawa's way of developing human relations -- mixing "reason" and 
"emotion." 
  There were also some young Dietmen in the SDPJ who 
sympathized with Ozawa on the political reform issue. They are 
Nobutaka Tsutsui, Yoshito Sengoku, and Shuo Matsubara, all of 
whom lost in the last election due to the waning popularity of 
the SDPJ. Matsubara, however, decided to leave the SDPJ and is 
planning to run in the next election as a candidate from the 
Shinseito. 
  Finally, let's examine the flaws and weaknesses in Ozawa's 
people connections. 
  As mentioned at the beginning of this article, when Ozawa 
believes he is right, he tends to cut people off, saying, "If 
you don't agree with me, you don't have to stay with me." This 
creates animosity toward Ozawa and drives his once close 
associates to leave him at once. 
  Koichi Kato is a good example. Also, Kishiro Nakamura and 
Kenzo Muraoka, who had been considered as Ozawa's close 
associates along with Nakanishi during their years in the 
Takeshita faction, became strongly against Ozawa when the 
Takeshita faction broke up in 1992. This is a danger that is 
always present in Ozawa politics. However, one young Dietmen 
from Shinseito says, "Mr. Ozawa is not the type of person who 
will bend his principle for the sake of human relations. Even if 
he goes into pieces in terms of his human relations, he will 
have to go forward. The question is how many people will be able 
to follow him then."

  [Text] ASAHI SHIMBUN conducted a nationwide telephone 
poll on 30 and 31 January on the public's attitude toward the 
enactment of the political reform bills and future directions of 
party regrouping. As a result, 57 percent said the political 
reform package is "no good" on the point that it failed in 
ruling out the business sector's political donations to 
individual politicians while 66 percent welcomed the enactment 
of the reform package as a whole. Nevertheless, only 23 percent 
said "the Japanese politics will be made better by the package," 
and 63 percent said "no change will happen." The majority said 
the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ] "had better break up," and 59 percent 
think moves toward further regrouping of political circles "will 
be accelerated." The support rate for the Hosokawa cabinet was 
74 percent. 
  The telephone survey was conducted immediately after the 
enactment of the political bills at the last moment of the 
extraordinary Diet session which closed on 29 January. ASAHI 
SHIMBUN interviewed 2,000 eligible voters all over the country, 
and obtained responses from 56 percent of them. 
  On the fact that the reform bills did not prohibit the 
business sector's donations to individual politicians, only 25 
percent showed positive responses to that. Even among the 
pro-LDP group, 49 percent were against such donations, compared 
with 39-percent support for the practice. 
  Regarding the new election system for the lower house, 39 
percent said the system which gives 300 seats to single-seat 
constituencies and 200 to proportional representation 
constituencies is "favorable," and 23 percent said it is 
"unfavorable." It appeared many voters cannot judge whether the 
new election system is good or bad, as 38 percent gave no answer 
or said they do not know. 
  Differing opinions were also seen in a question asking if 
the 
respondent thinks politics would become less expensive under the 
new election system. In response to the question, 36 percent 
said "politics would become less expensive," 36 percent said 
"politics would become more expensive," and 30 percent were in 
the "other answers or no answer" category. 
  When asked if the political reform package is valuable as a 
whole, 5 percent said "very valuable," 61 percent said 
"valuable," 21 percent said "not very valuable," and 4 percent 
said "valueless." As a result, 66 percent showed positive 
responses toward the package, while 25 percent were against it. 
  Nevertheless, only 23 percent said Japanese politics would 
"become better" under the new political system. It appears the 
public is showing favorable responses to the Diet decision on 
political reform, but is coolly watching future development. 
  In connection with the LDP's and the SDPJ's internal 
struggles over the political reform issue, 51 percent said "the 
LDP had better break up," and 56 percent said "the SDPJ had 
better break up." While only 25 percent of the pro-LDP group 
called for the LDP breakup, 41 percent of the SDPJ supporters 
called for a breakup of the party. 
  The degree of expectations for future regrouping of 
political 
parties varies depending on the respondents' political stances. 
The percentage of those who answered party regrouping would be 
"further accelerated" was around 50 percent among the LDP and 
SDPJ supporters, but the number exceeded 70 percent among 
Komeito and Shinsento [Japan Renewal Party] supporters. 
  To conduct general elections under the new election system, 
the Diet has to work out some frameworks, such as redesigning of 
election constituencies. But 61 percent of the respondents 
showed cautious stances toward an early dissolution of the lower 
house and general elections. 
  The support rate for the Hosokawa cabinet was 74 percent, 
and 
the non-support rate was 12 percent. In our telephone poll in 
September, the support and non-support rates were 73 and 11 
percent, respectively. The latest survey showed the support 
rate remains high. 
  In our interview surveys (of 3,000 eligible voters), the 
support rates for the Hosokawa cabinet were 71 percent in 
September, 70 percent in November, and 60 percent in December. 
Although the data from different surveys cannot be compared 
with our latest survey result, the support rate is probably 
picking up after the decline in December.

<F P=106> [Article by Takao Toshikawa: "Who Makes the Decisions in </F>
Japan-U.S. Negotiations?"] 
  [Text] The other day I had a chance to meet with Han 
Sung-su, South Korean ambassador to the United States. As it 
were, it was an unofficial meeting of a little less than an 
hour, but during the meeting we covered a wide range of topics, 
such as the critical nuclear problems posed by North Korea (the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea), the state of development 
of the meetings between U.S. and North Korean high government 
officials, Japan's political reform Diet, and the drastic reform 
policy by Kim Yong-sam's South Korean Government. 
  When I took my leave of the ambassador after the passage of 
our allotted time, I said to him as a matter of form: "I should 
very much like to see you in Tokyo some day." Ambassador Han 
winked at me, saying: "If I were appointed ambassador to Japan, 
I could meet you very often. But do not tell this to the 
present ambassador." I was a little surprised and impressed by 
his ready wit and humor. 
  The reason is that I have heard Ambassador Han is an 
influential person expected to become deputy prime minister and 
minister of the Economic Planning Board. 
  Almost all of the influential persons who assumed important 
posts under the No government were purged by the Kim Yong-sam 
government, and Ambassador Han is a rare exception. Such an 
influential ambassador talked to me frankly, listened to me with 
attention, and furthermore made a witty remark in reply which 
convinced me of his greatness. 
  At the same time, that made me think of our Japanese 
ambassador to the United States, and inadvertently made me 
compare the Japanese and South Korean ambassadors. My frank 
impression is there is a great difference between the two men. 
  Takakazu Kuriyama, ambassador to the United States, occupies 
a very high level in Japan as a diplomat. His father was also a 
diplomat. He has a good family background and served as a 
bureaucrat within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as chief of 
the Legal Affairs Division of the Treaties Bureau; chief of the 
Personnel Division of the Minister's Secretariat; director 
general of the Treaties Bureau; and director general of the 
North American Affairs Division. He was expected to be "future 
administrative vice minister" earlier on. He became 
administrative vice minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
in 1989 and ambassador to the United States in 1992. He is 
nimble and a model of the serious-minded "elite." He is also a 
spirited man, for during the Gulf war he offered resistance to 
the dispatch of the Self-Defense Forces as proposed by Ichiro 
Ozawa, then secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party, 
and was deprived of his position. 
  In short, although both Japanese and South Korean 
ambassadors 
to the United States are excellent, they are evaluated quite 
differently in Washington. My cursory inquiry into the matter 
prompted the following responses from diplomatic sources in 
Washington: 
  "Ambassador Han certainly has a good command of English. 
Most of all, he has a sense of humor and a rich stock of 
topics, which makes him popular in diplomatic circles. 
Therefore, he is always called upon to make a speech. However, 
although Ambassador Kuriyama is good at English, to our regret 
his speeches are uninteresting. Thus, he is rarely called upon 
to speak." The story goes that a member of the Japanese Embassy 
staff happened to listen to Ambassador Han's speech at the 
National Press Club in Washington in July 1993 and breathed the 
following remark: "He will never find this fellow." To my 
regret, I am obliged to say that the Japanese ambassador is 
slightly outdistanced by the South Korean ambassador. 
<H5>  What Is the Ambassador Doing? </H5>
  Is the difference between the Japanese and South Korean 
ambassadors to the United States only a matter of a sense of 
humor and their skillfulness in making a speech? The answer is 
absolutely in the negative. 
  [ Therefore, the problem is what kind of diplomatic 
activity are the Japanese ambassador and the embassy staff 
engaged in? We have heard some true stories about how Japanese 
ambassadors to the United States were not very useful at 
critical moments. 
  For example, a famous story is told about former Japanese 
Ambassador to the United States Ryohei Murata (present 
ambassador to Germany) who, upon arriving at his post, had 
considerable difficulty in meeting with Secretary of State Baker 
despite his repeated contacts with the White House under the 
Bush administration. Another occasion occurred in November 1991 
when the Miyazawa cabinet, which had just came to power, turned 
pale due to the sudden postponement of President Bush's visit to 
Japan which had already been scheduled. Ambassador Murata tried 
to meet with Brent Scowcroft (in charge of national security), 
but without success. Ambassador Murata managed to meet with 
Scowcroft through the good offices of former Japanese Ambassador 
to the United States Nobuo Matsunaga (currently a government 
representative) who was in the United States in connection with 
the public relations of the newly established Miyazawa 
administration, and who was an old friend of Scowcroft. Murata 
was told by the United States that President Bush's visit to 
Japan was not canceled but only postponed. 
  In addition, recently there was another occurrence. 
Ambassador Kuriyama managed to meet with Secretary of State 
Christopher four months after the inauguration of the Clinton 
administration. Armacost, a former U.S. ambassador to Japan, 
said "the relationship between Japan and the United States is 
the most important bilateral relationship," but Ambassador 
Kuriyama could not meet with the U.S. secretary of state -- 
which corresponds to the Japanese foreign minister -- for four 
months. Ambassador Kuriyama met with Secretary of State 
Christopher only because they had business to attend to in 
preparation for a Japan-U.S. summit meeting. At that time, the 
rumor spread that Ambassador Kuriyama would be replaced. 
  Compared with Japanese ambassadors who have often been 
slighted in this way, South Korean Ambassador Han Sung-su is 
conspicuous for his unique and strenuous efforts. 
  Compared with Japanese ambassadors, South Korean ambassadors 
are handicapped and cannot easily meet with high U.S. officials 
even if they want to. Therefore, Ambassador Han tried to gain 
access to the White House by energetically working by himself. 
Through the good offices of Vernon Jordan, a big-shot lawyer in 
charge of the transitional team for the Clinton administration, 
and of former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Robert 
Strauss, the most influential senior member of the Democratic 
Party, Ambassador Han made resolute approaches to the White 
House. After the APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) 
summit meeting held in Seattle in November last year, the 
Clinton-Kim meeting was realized, which was said to be largely 
attributable to Han's contacts. The first banquet held by 
President Clinton for foreign heads of state visiting the United 
States was for South Korean President Kim Yong-sam. 
  Whichever country it may be, ambassadors to the United 
States 
play an important role in deciding that country's diplomatic 
policy. This is especially the case with the relationship 
between Japan and the United States. Viewed from the U.S. 
position, this is evident by the fact that Ambassadors 
Reischauer and Mansfield led U.S. policy toward Japan. In this 
respect, Japanese ambassadors to the United States cannot 
compare with their South Korean counterparts. 
  Not only the ambassador but also the diplomats of the South 
Korean Embassy in the United States are very active. Concerning 
the collection of material from public hearings in Congress, 
which is the important work of diplomats, diplomats of the South 
Korean Embassy diligently visit both the Senate and House of 
Representatives, and never fail to follow the themes under their 
charge and collect information on them. 
  On the other hand, the diplomats of the Japanese Embassy 
do not visit the U.S. Congress very often, and they seldom 
collect materials on public hearings held by the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee, which should be considered the most 
important hearings. Even if they do attend, they entrust actual 
work to the local staff. Top officials at the embassy say, "We 
are short of hands and thus we cannot cover them." The reason 
for their being busy is that they have "chores," which are 
called attendance. In short, they have to receive and welcome 
politicians, local government leaders, and the heads of 
ministries and agencies, which prevents them from completely 
carrying out the primary functions of diplomats. 
<H5>  The Decline of the North American Affairs Bureau </H5>
  We have touched on the fringe of the malfunctioning of the 
Japanese Embassy in the United States. Now, how is the 
decisionmaking of the bureaucratic organization carried out? 
In other words, by what process are policy decisions made? 
Here we would like to investigate the actual state of 
decisionmaking by verifying Japan's policy toward the United 
States. 
  As Mr. Taichi Sakaiya [not further identified] says, "the 
myth that Japan and the United States are inseparable" is one of 
the three "myths" that have prescribed Japanese politics under 
the so-called 1955 system, together with "the myth that the 
administration of the Liberal Democratic Party is eternal" and 
"the myth that the bureaucrats are dependable." Japan's 
diplomacy as the embodiment of the myth that Japan and the 
United States are inseparable is based on the Japanese-U.S. 
axis, and Japan's diplomacy toward the United States has been 
Japan's diplomacy itself. 
  And, in the structure (organization) of the Foreign 
Ministry, 
this policy toward the United States is supposed to function 
under the hierarchies commanded by the administrative vice 
minister of foreign affairs. There are two lines of authority: 
One is the chief of the First North American Division 
(politics), the director general of the North American Affairs 
Bureau, and the deputy vice minister of foreign affairs (in 
charge of politics); and the other is the chief of the Second 
North American Division (economics), the director general of the 
North American Affairs Bureau, the director general of the 
Economic Affairs Bureau, and the deputy vice minister of foreign 
affairs (in charge of economics). In short, this is the 
organizational mechanism that governs the decisionmaking of the 
Foreign Ministry. 
  As its name indicates, the director general of the North 
American Affairs Bureau is the key man who plans and implements 
Japan's policy toward the United States, and he holds the 
central post in the mechanism of the decisionmaking of the 
Foreign Ministry. Therefore, under the reality that Japan's 
diplomacy toward the United States is Japan's diplomacy itself, 
the holding of the post of director general of the North 
American Affairs Bureau has meant climbing the ladder of success 
for the bureaucrats of the Foreign Ministry. And, in fact, the 
persons who held the post of director general of the North 
American Affairs Bureau such as So Yasukawa and Fumihiko Togo 
have been promoted, through the post of administrative vice 
minister, to be ambassadors to big countries such as the United 
States. 
  However, the popular belief that holding the post of 
director 
general of the North American Affairs Bureau will ensure one the 
post of administrative vice minister and eventually the post of 
Japanese ambassador to the United States did not apply to the 
last four directors general of the North American Affairs 
Bureau. They are: Hiroaki Fujii, incumbent ambassador to 
Thailand, who was director general of the North American Affairs 
Bureau during the Nakasone administration; Tatsuo Arima, 
incumbent ambassador to the Netherlands, who was director 
general of the North American Affairs Bureau at the time of the 
Takeshita administration when frictions between Japan and the 
United States over communications and construction issues were 
at their peak; Koichiro Matsuura, incumbent deputy vice minister 
of foreign affairs (in charge of economics), who was director 
general of the North American Affairs Bureau during the Kaifu 
administration when the Gulf war broke out; and Yukio Sato, 
incumbent director general of the North American Affairs Bureau 
and who is expected to be transferred as the ambassador to a 
medium-sized country in Europe. 
  Considering that the last four directors general of the 
North American Affairs Bureau fell off the ladder of success, 
Kasumigaseki [the seat of Japanese bureaucracy] expressed the 
opinion that "the North American Affairs Bureau has lost its 
influence." Actually, the decline of the voice and influence of 
the bureau's director general is noticeable in various ways. 
However, this phenomenon is not confined to Japan. The truth 
is the United States has also greatly changed its diplomacy 
toward Japan. 
  Under the Bush administration there was a team of three 
policymakers in the White House, with presidential aide Brent 
Scowcroft as the central figure. In the State Department there 
was the assistant undersecretary of state in charge of East 
Asia-Pacific affairs; he played a leading role in the U.S. 
policy toward Japan. However, under the Clinton administration 
the National Economic Council (NEC) was newly established, and 
this White House carriage is pulled by a pair: Anthony Lake, 
who is in charge of the National Security Council, and Robert 
Rubin, who is in charge of the National Economic Council. The 
subsidence of the National Security Council is also noticeable 
here, and Lake is called a "lame duck," which metaphorically 
means "he is virtually dead." 
  It is somewhat symbolic that the key men for both sides -- 
the director general of the North American Affairs Bureau within 
Japan's Foreign Ministry, and the presidential aide in charge of 
the U.S. National Security Council -- are both on the decline. 
There is an interesting story in connection with this matter. 
  Director General Sato of the North American Affairs Bureau 
has been friendly with Anthony Lake ever since his service with 
the Embassy in the United States during the Nixon 
administration, to the point he entered his daughter in Mount 
Holyoke College where Lake had taught; Lake is also the 
guarantor of Sato's daughter. Therefore, when it became certain 
Clinton would win the U.S. presidential election in the fall of 
1992 and Lake would become a member of the White House, Sato no 
longer hid "his long association with Lake." However, the 
Clinton administration's diplomatic and security team made a 
mistake as regards the former Yugoslavia, Haiti, and Somalia, 
which made the resignation of Defense Secretary Aspin 
inevitable. In addition, Lake is also on the verge of being 
fired. In short, Sato could not foresee the subsidence of the 
National Security Council. 
  A phenomenon considered to be a kind of diastrophism in the 
decisionmaking mechanism of the Foreign Ministry seems to be 
taking place in other posts besides the director generalship of 
the North American Affairs Bureau. The chief of the bureau's 
First North America Division is the implementor of Japan's 
policy toward the United States. For Foreign Ministry 
bureaucrats, holding this post means entering the fast track of 
advancement, if not the fastest track. However, recently those 
who occupied the post have failed to enter the fast track of 
advancement. It is possible they happened not to qualify for 
that post, but we cannot deny that former chiefs of the First 
North America Division have also increasingly failed to enter 
that track. 
  To cite concrete examples, in the past there was Yoshio 
Karita (ambassador to Denmark); recently there was Sadaaki 
Numata (councilor in charge of press), Ryuichiro Yamasaki 
(minister to Britain); Yukio Okamoto (retired), and Nobuaki 
Tanaka (counselor to Thailand). As stated above, recently 
successive chiefs of the First North America Division have 
failed to become top bureaucrats within the Foreign Ministry. 
  What does the subsidence of the director general of the 
North 
American Affairs Bureau and chief of the First North America 
Division signify? 
  To mention one thing about the recent trend, this 
phenomenon coincides with changes in the U.S. policy towards 
Japan. Before the collapse of the Cold War structure, the 
Japanese and U.S. decisionmaking concerning the Japan-U.S. 
relationship was in good order. Under the Bush administration, 
Scowcroft was the number one man in the White House, while Karl 
Jackson, the chief of the NSC's Asian Division, and Doug Pearl, 
head of the Japan Section, managed the U.S. policy toward Japan. 
Japan conducted its decisionmaking toward the United States 
under the following lineup: the chief of the First North 
America Division, the director general of the North American 
Affairs Bureau, the deputy vice minister of foreign affairs, and 
the administrative vice minister of foreign affairs. 
  With the end of the Cold War, there was a relative decrease 
in the need for security, which was the axis of the Japan-U.S. 
relationship. Furthermore, with the appearance of President 
Clinton who "decides everything by himself," the U.S. lineup 
collapsed, which influenced Japanese decisionmaking. As a 
result, the arrangement which "attaches too much importance to 
the North American Affairs Bureau" has lost its balance, causing 
chaos in the Foreign Ministry's decisionmaking mechanism. 
  In other words, this proves that the Foreign Ministry's 
decisionmaking process has been conducted by a very small number 
of bureaucratic elite, sometimes in a very arbitrary manner and 
without a spirit of independence, following in the footsteps of 
the United States. In addition, there lies in the background 
the deadlock of the distinct vertical system observed by 
Japanese bureaucracy. 
  The Foreign Ministry has always advocated the 
"centralization 
of diplomacy," but the "centralization of diplomacy" and the 
vertical system of administration have become increasingly 
incompatible with each other amid the mutability of the world 
situation due to the end of the Cold War as well as to the 
acceleration of a borderless economy. The reason is the Foreign 
Ministry finds it difficult to take the complete initiative in 
any given field -- such as Japan-U.S. trade frictions in every 
field, peacekeeping operations, the preservation of the Earth's 
environment, and rice. 
  Under such circumstances, the decisionmaking process 
initiated by the North American Affairs Bureau has lost its 
authority and executive faculty. In the Foreign Ministry, the 
following posts of the administrative section have been regarded 
as the fastest tracks for success, and have increasingly 
acquired importance: the chief of the Policy Coordination 
Division of the Secretariat, the chief of the Personnel 
Division, the chief of the Treaties Division of the Treaties 
Bureau, and the chief of the Legal Affairs Division of the 
Treaties Bureau. 
  For one thing, this means that men of superior ability show 
a 
strong tendency to avoid diplomatic frontline posts chock full 
of difficulty, and thus take the social escalator, tolerating 
the holding of posts. 
  If such a mood prevails, a typical bureaucratic process will 
exercise greater influence in which the acting chief will make 
plans, the chief will flesh them out, and the director general 
will lay the groundwork within and without the Foreign Ministry 
for the approval of the plans, thus further increasing the 
opaqueness of decisionmaking. 
<H5>  The Decisionmaking of the "Ichi-Ni Combination" </H5>
  Rightly or wrongly, there is a saying that "Japanese 
politics 
is third rate, its economics is first rate, and its bureaucracy 
is ultra-first rate." In the background of such a saying lies a 
situation in which the bureaucrats have taken the leadership 
under the collusive relationship among "politicians, 
bureaucrats, and the business world." Taking advantage of such 
a situation, the "bureaucracy" has taken an active part not only 
in the decisionmaking of ministries and agencies, but also in 
the process of national policy decisions. 
  This has been made possible principally due to the 
weakness and corruption of "politics." If politicians are 
strong and steady, they can apply the brakes to undue 
intervention in policy decisions or to arbitrary decisionmaking 
by the bureaucrats, driving a wedge between them. Actually 
there are some cases in which "politicians" have attained 
hegemony amid weakness and corruption. 
  In the field of diplomacy, former Foreign Minister Michio 
Watanabe exercised leadership as an "influential minister" 
during the passage of a peacekeeping operations bill and in 
arranging the emperor's visit to the PRC. He also mediated for 
the normalization of relations between the United States and 
Vietnam, and between the PRC and Vietnam, with the greater aim 
of rehabilitating Vietnam. Evaluations aside, we can cite the 
following examples: 1) Ichiro Ozawa, deputy chief cabinet 
secretary of the Takeshita administration, went to the United 
States as a government envoy and led the Japan-U.S. construction 
consultations to a successful conclusion; 2) the opening of 
normalization negotiations between Japan and North Korea was 
decided upon through the visit to North Korea by Shin Kanemaru, 
vice president of the Liberal Democratic Party; and 3) Ryutaro 
Hashimoto, finance minister in the Kaifu administration, took 
the initiative in providing an international contribution of $9 
billion during the Gulf war. 
  However, politicians cannot wage an effective rollback 
policy 
against the bureaucrats because the information and knowledge 
which are the foundation of a strong initiative have been held 
by the bureaucrats during the long administration of the Liberal 
Democratic Party. Information is available only when there is 
knowledge and connections. In that respect, the bureaucratic 
organization, which has enormous power of approval and license, 
as well as a network of various organizations, holds a dominant 
position. Furthermore, to make matters worse the coalition 
parties which have come to power in place of the Liberal 
Democratic Party are in a disadvantageous position. 
  The weakening of the base of the coalition parties, as well 
as the decline of the decisionmaking mechanism within 
policy-making government agencies, as seen in the subsidence of 
the Foreign Ministry's North American Affairs Bureau, has 
induced the Finance Ministry to expand its "hegemony." At 
present, "restrictions" imposed by the Finance Ministry on 
"politicians, bureaucrats, and the business world" are very 
severe. 
  Of all the industrialized countries, Japan's Finance 
Ministry 
is said to be the only agency which monopolizes absolute power 
over budgets and finance. It can be said the Finance Ministry, 
through its supreme command of finances, is obtaining control 
over the bureaucracy. With contacts established widely and 
deeply, and with his overwhelming power to collect information, 
Administrative Vice Minister Jiro Saito -- who is said to be "a 
vice minister of great caliber who appears only once in twenty 
years" -- is among the top bureaucrats within the Finance 
Ministry. Saito, in combination with Ichiro Ozawa, 
representative secretary general of Shinseito who is said to be 
"the behind-the-scenes producer" of the current coalition 
government, is said to have gained great influence. This is 
called the Ichi-Ni combination. 
<H5>  Seven Men in the Inner Sanctuary </H5>
  Many examples show how powerful bureaucratic control 
actually 
is. For example, before the Hosokawa cabinet could implement 
urgent economic countermeasures, Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa himself 
had to meet with Saito directly, seeking his cooperation on two 
and one occasions respectively. Moreover, Prime Minister 
Hosokawa had wanted to assure President Clinton of the 
implementation of an income tax cut at their meeting in November 
last year, but Hosokawa could not obtain a "tax cut" because the 
Finance Ministry would not forego a consumption tax increase of 
7 percent as the revenue source for the income tax cut. 
  The decisionmaking of the Finance Ministry is based on 
the principle of having affairs run by a few select people of 
superior quality. It is said a major issue like determining the 
rate for consumption taxes is decided upon by seven men -- the 
administrative vice minister, the director general of the 
Secretariat, the director general of the Tax Bureau, the 
councilor in charge of the Tax Bureau, the chief of the 
Coordination Division, the chief of the Second Tax Division, and 
the assistant chief of the Second Tax Division of the Tax 
Bureau. One of the reasons this is possible is that excessive 
sectionalism is thoroughly practiced within the Finance 
Ministry. For example, the chief of the First Tax Division -- 
one of the elite -- cannot meddle in the affairs regarding 
consumption taxes because he is in charge of the direct tax. 
  It goes without saying that decisionmaking undertaken by 
only 
seven bureaucrats in the inner sanctuary of the Finance Ministry 
cannot be transparent. 
  It is also needless to say that the bureaucrats are not 
elected by the people and thus cannot be discharged by the 
people. The greatest issue is whether it is permissible to let 
such bureaucrats, and a very few of the able bureaucrats at 
that, control national policies at their own will. 
  Lynn Williams, former deputy U.S. trade representative who 
had a verbal dispute with Japanese bureaucrats at Japan-U.S. 
trade negotiations, offered incisive criticism: "We cannot 
understand the concrete substance of Japanese rules and 
regulations unless we ask the bureaucrats about them. Of the 
industrialized countries, Japan is the only nation which 
continues to have a system deficient in transparency" (NIHON 
KEIZAI SHIMBUN, dated 9 November 1993). However, the aim of 
Japanese bureaucracy is to make rules and regulations which are 
"incomprehensible without the help of bureaucrats." 
  David Sanger, Tokyo Bureau chief for THE NEW YORK TIMES, 
asked Prime Minister Hosokawa at a news conference following the 
Japan-U.S. summit held in November last year: "Political reform 
is now being promoted with the birth of the new administration 
in Japan, but will it not be difficult for the prime minister to 
carry leadership over into Japan's powerful bureaucratic 
organization?" That question, which touched upon the core of the 
matter, frightened the prime minister's circle. 
  The reason is that Sanger's question is indicative of his 
recognition that Ichiro Ozawa, the creator of the Hosokawa 
administration, and Jiro Saito, super-vice minister of the 
Finance Ministry -- the so-called Ichi-Ni combination -- have a 
firm grip on the coalition government. It may be needless to 
say such a view underlies the Clinton administration's 
recognition of Japan. 
  However, Ozawa is shocking Kasumigaseki by advocating a 
rather bold idea of excluding bureaucratic control. The 
essential features of Ozawa's plan are: 1) abolition of a 
bureaucrat's reply at the Diet as a government delegate; 2) 
parliamentary vice ministers will be renamed vice ministers, and 
two or three vice ministers will be stationed at each ministry; 
3) several Diet members will be placed under vice ministers as 
parliamentary deputy vice ministers. Upon hearing this, 
Kasumigaseki grew agitated, saying: "Great Heavens! Is 
Nagatacho (the center of Japanese Government) going to take over 
Kasumigaseki?" 
  In response, Ozawa answered in his book "Plan for Reforming 
Japan": "This is not a takeover of government offices by 
politicians. All the bureaucrats have to do is observe 
political neutrality as bureaucrats and whole-heartedly assist 
politicians as technocrats." Whatever political aim Ozawa's 
idea may have, all the same it deserves attention and high 
evaluation in the sense that it has proposed a concrete measure 
against bureaucratic control. 
  Masahisa Naito, who was the director general of the 
Industrial Policy Bureau and was certain to be "the next 
administrative vice minister of the International Trade and 
Industry," was advised to resign by International Trade and 
Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagaya at the end of last year. 
This incident, which became the topic of discussion, is an 
example of the embodiment of Ozawa's idea; Kumagaya is a 
well-known close aide of Ozawa. 
  At any rate, what is important now is to propose a concrete 
plan for breaking away from the current politics, which is 
controlled by the bureaucrats. In that respect, unless 
effective reform measures are initiated, it will be impossible 
to enrich our political options.

  [Text] On 31 January, the Finance Ministry desperately 
launched a counteroffensive concerning the issue of how to 
finance expected revenue shortfalls amid a growing argument 
between the ruling coalition parties and the Prime Minister's 
Office calling for separating the issue of a consumption tax 
hike from planned income tax cuts. 
  "As finance minister, I cannot take responsibility for 
compiling the national budget." These were the words of 
complaint that an infuriated Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii 
made to Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who had 
hinted at separating the issue of a consumption tax increase 
from an income tax cut, after Fujii marched into the Prime 
Minister's Office on the morning of the same day. Such remarks 
are rather unusual at a time when the process of drafting the 
budget is in its final stages. Fujii expressed his strong 
determination that he "is prepared to resign" if a consumption 
tax hike were to be shelved. After registering his complaint 
with Takemura, Fujii held a news conference and said: "It is the 
basic policy of the government to treat them (tax cut and tax 
hike) as a single package. I would like the ruling coalition 
party representatives to finalize opinions within their parties 
within this framework." 
  While the gloomy atmosphere of a possible Diet dissolution 
and subsequent general elections made a remarkable turnaround 
with the passage of the political reform bills, Takemura had 
made his earlier remarks at a time when the Finance Ministry 
felt that "hopes have revived concerning the possibility of a 
consumption tax increase" (as stated by a senior Finance 
Ministry official). Thus, the ministry all the more hopes to 
put the brakes on the idea of shelving a consumption tax hike 
from becoming widespread. Senior officials of the Finance 
Ministry's Tax Bureau have visited such places as the Diet 
Members' Office Building in an earnest effort to try to persuade 
politicians to support the ministry's idea to have the amount of 
the consumption tax hike and the date of its implementation 
expressly stated in the tax bills. 
  One senior Finance Ministry official said: "It is all or 
nothing regarding the consumption tax hike. Either it will be 
written in the law or not." The ruling coalition parties have 
maintained that "it would be satisfactory to spend one to two 
years coming up with a final decision." The official's 
understanding is that if the ministry agreed to this coalition 
plan to carry over debate on a consumption tax hike to the next 
Diet session, "it would in fact be equivalent to having given up 
on securing a source of revenue." 
  After attending a meeting of the Council on Economic Issues 
held on the evening of the same day, Fujii told reporters, "The 
government has confirmed that it will treat income tax cuts and 
a consumption tax hike as a single package." He thus stressed 
that no changes have been made to the original plans. When 
asked whether the amount of the consumption tax increase and the 
date of its implementation would also be decided in the same 
package, Fujii smiled and said, "They will be treated as a 
single package."

<F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 4 February Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] In relation to the administration's plan to 
introduce the national welfare tax, Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura indicated strong opposition on 3 February to 
the decision made despite the disagreement of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]. It is very unusual for a 
chief cabinet secretary, who serves as the prime minister's 
"head clerk," to contest the government's policy. Apparently, 
Takemura had thought that the prime minister's final decision 
would not indicate the rate of tax increase or the period of 
implementation, and that it would be acceptable to the SDPJ. He 
seems to be increasingly unhappy with Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, who acceded to the wishes of Ichiro Ozawa, secretary 
general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] -- who represents the 
Finance Ministry's views -- as in the recent case of the Diet 
deliberations on the political reform bills. 
  At a general meeting of Sakigake's [Harbinger] Diet members 
held in the early hours of 3 February, strong criticism of the 
prime minister flared up. Takemura seemed to believe that "What 
happened was so abrupt that we were all baffled. There are many 
Diet members who do not approve of this. If we let things go on 
like this, the situation is going to become very serious." Some 
Sakigake members expressed the opinion that "You should (ask the 
prime minister to revise his plan) with a determination to 
resign [if he refuses]." 
  Takemura also spoke at the gathering. One Diet member 
attending the meeting said, "Our leader [Takemura] thinks that 
if the plan is not revised, the coalition government will 
collapse. He was dead serious." He disclosed that if the prime 
minister does not revise his plan, Takemura is determined to 
resign as chief cabinet secretary. 
  However, Takemura himself denied this at a news conference 
in 
the early evening of 3 February, saying: "I have not expressed 
any intention to resign. I am not thinking of leaving my job 
half done." Nevertheless, he seemed to have definitely given 
the impression at the Sakigake meeting that he would resign. 
  Takemura visited the prime minister at the latter's office 
on 
the morning of 3 February to ask him to revise the tax plan. At 
a news conference held later, Takemura said: "There are no 
absolutes in politics. There is also the saying that the best 
thing to do with a mistake is to correct it. There are 
instances in which it is not right to take the attitude that 
what has been decided cannot be changed." He thus indicated 
that an agreement has been reached at his meeting with the prime 
minister to revise the tax plan. It seems that a rebellion from 
the very core of the administration, on top of the bitter 
opposition from the SDPJ, the No. 1 ruling party, has succeeded 
in accelerating moves to effect a revision. 
  Takemura had commended the flexible attitude taken by the 
SDPJ before the prime minister made his decision. He was, 
therefore, taken by surprise by the subsequent decision of the 
prime minister, whom he had expected to take the SDPJ's position 
into consideration, to accede 100 percent to the suggestions of 
the Finance Ministry. 
  In this connection, Takemura said during the news 
conference: 
"The prime minister had been fully informed of developments in 
the SDPJ. He might have taken the optimistic view that somehow 
things would work out in the end." Other senior government 
officials gave a different version of what happened. They 
claimed, "Because top- ranking SDPJ officials had said 'The 
government can do as it likes,' there could be various 
interpretations of this." In any case, the influence of Ozawa, 
in speaking for the Finance Ministry, can undeniably be felt 
behind the prime minister's decision. Takemura, who was not 
able to participate directly in the decisionmaking process 
leading to the plan to introduce the national welfare tax, must 
have had very mixed feelings.

  Although the official discount rate was lowered on 26 
September by a wider margin that the market's expectations, 
future economic prospects still appear bleak. As for the stock 
market, share prices began the decline from early 1990 ahead of 
the real economy and subsequently, though trading is more active 
that at one time, the turnover is approximately 300 million 
shares (daily average trading volume during September) or less 
than one-third of that during the peak period. Thus, the stock 
market is still in the wintry season, but there are encouraging 
signs. Subscriptions to JR [Japan Railway] East Japan shares 
surpassed initital estimates and showed a glimpse of the 
potential investors' strength. 
  One would like to blame the current recession of the real 
economy as the main and sole reason why the stock market has 
been sluggish for such a long period, but if the developments 
leading up until now are analyzed carefully, one notices that 
many causes lie in the securities sector itself, and they have 
been contributing greatly to market stagnancy. Overshadowed by 
the severity of the economic recession, these problems are 
becoming less noticeable, but to recall potential investors to 
the exchange and build a strong market, the problems of the 
stock market itself must be resolved fundamentally. 
  At the request of the Tokyo Stock Exchange Regular Members 
Association, this research institute organized the "Research 
Committee on the Future Securities Market and Securities 
Industry" (chairman, Osaka University Professor Shoichi Royama) 
in October 1992 and had been conducting discussions and 
research, and the results have now been compiled into a report 
for release. The report points out the problems of the 
securities market and proposes measures that should be taken to 
develop the market and also presents a view of the future 
securities market and industry. 
  Portions of the report are presented below. 
<H5>  Future Stock Market as Seen From Qualitative Standpoint </H5>
  In the report, the future image of the stock market is 
visualized from both the qualitative and quantitative 
standpoints. The future stock market, as seen from the 
qualitative standpoint, is discussed first. 
  Changes in the Trading System 
  Heretofore, the securities trading system followed by the 
main advanced capitalist countries, including the United States, 
the United Kingdom, and Germany, has centered on stock exchanges 
and was generally similar to Japan's trading system. However, in 
recent years, this traditional trading system has been 
undergoing drastic changes on a worldwide scale. 
  As causes for the change, the growth of institutional 
investors, development of electronics, competition among 
exchanges, etc. can be mentioned. The growth of institutional 
investors has caused changes in the rules affecting fixed 
commissions, market concentration requirements, restrictions on 
dealings by brokers, etc., while the development of electronics 
has made possible transactions that do not require a trading 
floor. Also, the trading system is changing drastically because 
of competition among exchanges, whether domestic or foreign, to 
attract transactions. Japan is not an exception. These changes 
will probably have various effects on the securities industry in 
the future. For example, the execution function in dealer 
operations might become less important, the management service 
function might become more significant, and the importance of 
the dealer's role as a market maker, which was not seriously 
regarded up until now, might increase in the future. 
  Expand Business Sphere of Securities Industry 
  Through advancement of liberalization, the business sphere 
of 
the securities industry might expand. As reasons for the 
potential expansion, first, the development of financial 
transactions in the form of negotiable securities to preclude 
assumption of indirect financial institutions' operational costs 
can be considered. Other reasons that can be mentioned are: 
Through mutual entries permitted by financial system reform, 
commercial products which could not be handled up until now can 
be offered; since the definition of securities was widened 
through revision of the Securities and Exchange Law, the 
development of new securities is possible; because of complete 
liberalization of deposit interest rates, investment trusts and 
bonds have become relatively advantageous; and, through 
functional diversification of financial services, the fields in 
which securities companies can participate will expand. 
  On the other hand, however, liberalization will bring to the 
securities sector competition that differs from the past. 
Business strategies important to "normal industries," such as 
pricing and marketing, which had tended to be ignored in the 
past will have to be taken seriously by brokerages in the 
future. Also, through liberalization, securities companies will 
acquire the freedom to engage in various types of operations but 
to survive, the selection of business activities (freedom to 
reject) will probably become an important point. 
  Stock Market--Little Hope of Continuous Growth 
  During the phase of spiraling stock prices until late 1989, 
the increase in stock prices was not founded on expansion of the 
real economy; investment activities as well as fund procurement 
operations based on optimistic expectations for the future were 
noticeable in the market. Subsequently, with late 1989 as the 
historic peak, stock prices declined steadily until August 1992 
and turned slightly upward as comprehensive economic measures 
were undertaken. 
  However, the drop in corporate profits caused by the rapid 
yen appreciation subsequently thwarted the rise in stock prices 
and a long-term stalemate has emerged. From the standpoint of 
long-range price fluctuations, the time is judged to be 
favorable for a swing upward, but, reflecting stagnant real 
economic growth, a continuous rise as in the past is probably 
too much to expect. 
  Bond Market--Increased Ratio of Local Government 
Bonds 
  Because the organization and buildup as well as the 
deregulation of Japan's bond market started with national bonds, 
a market that is extremely slanted to government bonds was 
created. However, in recent years, because efforts were placed 
on the growth of the corporate bond market and also because of 
banks' reluctance to extend loans and the sluggishness of equity 
financing, the standing of the corporate bond market rose 
rapidly in the bond and debentures market. Through further 
deregulation, the issuance of ordinary corporate bonds will 
probably increase even more in the future. Also, as the role 
played by regions increases in public investments, the ratio of 
local government bonds is expected to increase. 
  Activating the bond market means increasing bond circulation 
and, to accomplish that, it is important to organize and 
strengthen the market as well as revise various procedures and 
simultaneously enhance the marketability of bonds. As measures 
to revise local government bonds, the following can be 
considered: simplify name transfer procedures; increase the 
issuance lot; employ the lump sum redemption system at 
maturity; issue tax-exempt bonds; and issue variable interest 
bonds as in public offerings. As for ordinary corporate bonds, 
measures to energize the market are producing results, but 
further deregulation and strengthening of market-making 
operations are desirable. 
  Derivative Market--Needs Continue To Increase 
  As evident today, the growth of the derivative market has 
been impeded temporarily by stricter controls but if the highly 
unstable environment continues, new innovations will probably 
appear to circumvent the regulations and neutralize the 
controls. The derivative market is a market that emerged in 
response to the demands of the age. The conditions which made 
the derivative market necessary, such as the globalization of 
financial markets, progress of institutionalization and 
increased need for risk management, might continue to intensify, 
but they will not weaken. In addition, prerequisites to 
development of the derivative market, such as elevation of 
financial skills in risk management, computerization, etc., are 
in place. 
  Nevertheless, the derivative market is not entirely free of 
problems. Though charges that it is the hotbed of market 
manipulations and illegal transactions are not founded on firm 
evidences, such criticisms have a certain persuasiveness and the 
fact that they have been circulating for a long period creates a 
problem. The market must be able to give the confidence to 
participants that "this is the arena for fair games played under 
specific rules." Regulatory agencies, exchanges, and independent 
governing bodies should establish rules based on actual 
conditions and supervise their enforcement. 
  Institutional Investors--Reassessing Systematic 
Investments 
  In Japan's stock market, there had been hardly any 
institutional investor in the traditional sense of the term. By 
traditional institutional investors we are referring to 
financial brokerages, in a broad sense, which collect funds from 
ultimate investors, like individuals, and invest in portfolios 
with the optimum risk-and-return combination suited to the 
investment goals. 
  Today, the stock investment environment surrounding banks, 
life insurance companies, etc., is changing noticeably. Because 
the risks of stock investments were revealed by the bursting of 
the "bubble," and banks and insurance companies, which had 
depended on assets like Japanese stocks for most of their 
earnings through capital gains, are losing the income base to 
retain them, systematic investments prioritizing dealings with 
corporations are being reassessed. As a result, these investors 
are reemerging as institutional investors in the traditional 
sense. The activities of these institutional investors will 
probably exert a strong influence on the future stock market. 
  Individual Investors--Possess Investment Reserve 
  Individual investors are being eagerly awaited because of 
the 
expectation that individuals have steadily accumulated financial 
assets and they make investment decisions that are different 
from those made by institutional investors and that widens the 
scope and increases the efficiency of the stock market. The 
table compares the percentages of monetary asset accumulations 
and equity investments between Japanese and American individual 
investors. Judging by this table, it can be said that 
considering the monetary asset accumulations, stock investments 
by individual investors in Japan are at a low level. In short, 
there is believed to be an adequate reserve for investments.

  Then, how can individual investors be persuaded to 
participate in the stock market? As incentives, the elimination 
of double taxation of dividends or the introduction of the 
imputation system as an easing measure and the lowering of 
commissions for individuals or drastic reductions in minimum 
investment requirements, etc., can be mentioned. 
  Corporations--Information Disclosure Encouraged 
  Criticism is heard from various quarters about the fund 
procurement activities of corporations during the "bubble" 
period, but, from the standpoint of cost of funds, one can say 
that those operations had been rational. In retrospect, the 
responsibility for the causes of excessive investments should 
not be placed only on corporations but on the entire market 
organization which continued to hold misplaced expectations for 
a long time. 
  When similar situations arise in the future, it can be fully 
anticipated that corporations will take identical actions (as 
judged, too, by the actions now being taken by U.S. 
corporations). A step that can be taken is to prevent faulty 
expectations from dominating the market for a long period. To 
accomplish that, it is essential to fully disclose to investors, 
in an easily understandable form, correct information on future 
corporate earnings. 
<H5>  Future Stock Market as Seen From Quantitative Standpoint </H5>
  The scale of the stock market in the year 2000 was estimated 
using an econometric model. Estimates were made in two steps. In 
the first step, the six macro variables of GNP, money supply, 
current account balance, stock prices, long-term interest rates, 
and exchange rates were estimated according to the Bayes 
multivariate time-series analytical method. Next, in the second 
stage, the structural equation was projected from past data into 
which estimates of macro variables predicted in the first step 
were inserted and numerical values associated with the stock 
market were forecast. 
  Relative to results of the first step, as for the nominal 
GNP, an average annual growth of 3.8 percent is estimated from 
1992 until 2000, and for M2 + CD, which is the representative 
index of money supply, an average annual rise of 4.8 percent is 
predicted. To point out the main item among the estimated values 
related to the stock market in 2000, TOPIX (Tokyo Stock Price 
Index) will be at the level of 2,061. This is equivalent to 80 
percent of the 1989 average, which was the highest level 
recorded. Also, stock transaction volume will amount to 
approximately 320 trillion yen, about the level of 1988. Bond 
trading will amount to approximately 7,000 trillion yen, 
equivalent to the 1987 level, which was the historic high. 
  In the forecasts, dummy "bubble" variables were used, so 
when 
the "bubble" period is used as the base, there is a possibility 
of underestimation. Also, the effects of listing JR East Japan 
stock were not considered so, after it is put on the market, 
that aspect should be taken into consideration. 
<H5>  Develop Acceptable Stock Price Mechanism </H5>
  One of the conclusions reached by this research committee is 
that, "in Japan's stock market, a mechanism that will enable 
stock prices to reflect the real economy has not been fully 
established." To establish prices that conform to actual 
conditions--for example, so that price levels will not be 
determined by only relative relations between land and stock 
prices or futures and spot prices--a market that will properly 
evaluate stock price levels in relation to other economic 
variables must be developed. As shown by the response to public 
offerings of JR East Japan stock, investors have considerable 
interest in and reserve funds to invest. There should be many 
investors who want to invest in stocks if they find the price 
mechanism acceptable. 
  Furthermore, as pointed out earlier in the section on 
liberalization and transaction system changes, the securities 
business sphere is expanding and development of new operations 
is possible. On the other hand, however, the reassessment of 
past operations is deemed to be necessary. For example, this 
comment was heard recently. "In the sales of JR stock, 
brokerages are paying for such expenses as the distribution of 
applications out of their own pockets." Heretofore, dealings 
that might be considered coercive were being transacted to 
attain the quota; however, it appears that business was being 
conducted loosely with the attitude that nothing more needed to 
be done as long as the balance was in the black. 
  Presently, what the securities circle should do is not to 
adopt a passive attitude of only awaiting the recovery of 
corporate performance, but to draw blueprints of the future 
stock market and translate them into actions which will make the 
image a reality. In that event, we hope that this report will 
serve as a reference.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, February 3 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
newspaper "ARDYN ERH" reports of meeting of chairman of the 
Great State Hural N. Bagabandi with newsmen. At the press 
conference N. Bagabandi told about his impressions during his 
trip around the Tub and Dundgobi Aymags of the country. He 
noted that the rural population especially herdsmen have not 
been informed properly about the laws and provisions being taken 
lately. Owing to this, he said, the propaganda of the laws 
should be promoted amongst the rural population both in line of 
the government and through the local authorities. Especially 
through the administration of primary territorial units. 
  The newspaper publishes an interview granted to its 
correspondent by chairman of the standing parliamentary 
committee D. Lundeejantsan concerning the outcome of examining 
by a working group of the Great State Hural the activities of 
the secret service. D. Lundeejantsan stressed that in the 
course of inspection there has not been found any facts 
affirming the abuse of official position and bribery of which 
were accused some members of the parliament and government. 
Neither was corroborated the information by the former chief of 
the counterintelligence department of the main board on ensuring 
state security L. Sanjaasuren relating to the so called 
intentions on liquidating such documents being available in the 
board. D. Lundeejantsan noted in particular, that chairman of 
the parliament N. Bagabandi, his deputy J. Gombojav, Prime 
Minister P. Jasray have said about the necessity for restoration 
of their honour and dignity. 
  The newspaper informs about the statement by the Social 
Democratic Party which contains their demand for resignation of 
abovementioned officials of their posts due to their 
compromising. 
  The newspaper publishes information on supposing issue of 8 
volume anthology of Mongolian literature beginning since the 
works by prominent representatives of old literature up to the 
modern ones. 
  The publication would be sponsored by the "Asia" Trading and 
Production Company having provided all the means necessary. It 
is supposed that all the eight volumes would be issued within 
the current year. 
  The central organ of the ruling Mongolian People's 
Revolutionary Party "Unen" reports of the round table talk 
dedicated to the birthday anniversary of an outstanding figure 
of the 1921 people's revolution one of the founders of the MPRP, 
state and people's army D. Suhbaatar. The talk was organized by 
the D. Suhbaatar foundation. Scholars participating told about 
new discoveries concerning the life and activities of D. 
Suhbaatar and his brothers- inarms taking part in the national 
liberation movement. 
  The newspaper carries an article by writer L. Darisuren 
relating to the circumstances of the death of D. Suhbaatar. The 
author is supporting the version saying that D. Suhbaatar was 
poisoned.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 7 February Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] In relation to the structural reform of the 
insurance industry, the Ministry of Finance [MOF] has decided to 
institute a "public hearing system" to hear the views of private 
companies. This measure is being taken in response to U.S. 
demands in the insurance sector negotiations at the Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks to promote more transparency in 
government administration. This proposal will be presented at 
the bilateral negotiations to be held in Washington on 7 
February as a compromise plan. 
  While MOF will work further on the details of the public 
hearing system, concrete measures being considered include 
allowing a certain period of time for insurance companies to 
submit written suggestions on insurance structural reform to the 
MOF, and giving foreign insurance companies the opportunity to 
attend deliberations at the Insurance Council, and to state 
their views. 
  At the framework talks, the U.S. Government has been 
demanding since last fall more transparency in the process of 
structural reform. At first, the United States had demanded 
that structural reform should proceed simultaneously with 
bilateral negotiations but has recently softened its position to 
demanding opportunities for private insurance companies, 
including foreign insurers, to state their views before the 
structural reform plan is formally decided upon. 
  The U.S. Government is apprehensive that the MOF may proceed 
with structural reform while coordinating with Japanese 
insurance companies, thereby excluding foreign companies' 
participation. Furthermore, in the United States, structural 
reform is always accompanied by free airing of views from the 
private sector after the draft plan is announced. In some 
cases, opinions of the private sector are incorporated into the 
final plan. Such difference in administrative procedures is one 
reason why the United States seeks a public hearing system 
similar to its own. 
  MOF is in the process of reforming the insurance system, 
with 
particular emphasis on amending the Insurance Law. It plans to 
present the draft amendments to the regular Diet session in 
1995. Among the reform measures being considered are: 
liberalizing the third sector insurance -- such as insurance 
for injuries, illnesses and nursing services -- where both life 
and non-life insurance companies participate, and introducing a 
brokerage system, where brokers recommend the most advantageous 
insurance policies for the clients. U.S. insurance companies 
have also shown great interest in the outcome of the reform plan.

  [Text] A senior official of the Bank of Japan, in 
connection with U.S. decision on 4 February to implement a 
tighter monetary policy, believes that "it is a precautionary 
measure against inflation and will have little impact on 
Japanese economy, since chances are slim that long- and 
short-term interest rates in the United States will rise 
rapidly." He, therefore, maintains that "Japanese monetary 
policies will not be affected."

economic department] 
  [Text] It seems that U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor's visit to Japan from 1 to 4 February ended as a 
"disappointing trip." This is because Japan's stance of 
rejecting numerical targets was firm and an attempt to find a 
political compromise by holding ministerial negotiations fell 
through. On the contrary, Kantor, who had demonstrated his 
stance of not resuming trade negotiations unless Japan agrees to 
accept the numerical targets, was forced to agree to the 
resumption of vice ministerial talks. 
  On the evening of 2 February, Hiroshi Kumagai, international 
trade and industry minister, greeted Kantor by jokingly saying: 
"I met with Deputy Prime Minister Hata a little while ago. His 
face was swollen up because you gave him a strong punch." At 
his meeting with Hata, deputy prime minister and concurrently 
foreign minister, Kantor, while hinting at the possibility of 
applying sanctions against Japan, urged Hata to accept the 
numerical targets. Kantor's appeal was so strong that Foreign 
Minister Hata had to call for resumption of the meeting. Hata 
felt that it would not be "beneficial to Japan if Kantor goes 
home angry." 
  "Japan drops out of a poker game if you bluff regardless of 
your cards in hand." Comparing negotiations with Japan to a 
poker game, U.S. officials are reportedly cracking a joke, 
saying that the best way to carry out negotiations with Japan is 
to assume a hard-line stance. Kantor faithfully put this tactic 
into practice. 
  However, many Japanese Government officials were saying, 
even 
before Kantor came to Japan: "All we have to do is to make 
counterarguments even if Kantor strongly insists on his 
demands." "Probably, Kantor himself does not think that he has a 
change to win. He must be thinking that it will be a bonus if 
he manages to extract a compromise from Japan." It can be said 
that the Japanese Government officials knew Kantor's tactic. 
  On 4 February after the resumed meeting with Foreign 
Minister 
Hata, Kantor called his trip a "significant trip." However, 
some Japanese officials analyzed Kantor's remark coolly and 
said: "What he means is that he recognized the differences of 
opinion between Japan and the United States and that he 
confirmed Japan's stance of not making a compromise over the 
numerical targets." 
  In addition to putting finishing touches to mapping out an 
action program (action plan) regarding government procurement, 
Japan is doing its best in buckling down to the task of 
preparing a cooperation plan, based on efforts by private 
companies, in the field of car and car parts as well. Members 
of the Japanese negotiation team are saying: "The United States 
will withdraw its demands at the end because Japan is doing its 
best. Possibility of cooperation will expand only if the United 
States withdraws its demands on the numerical targets." It is 
still unknown if the negotiations will turn out as the Japanese 
delegation team has figured. Everything depends on the vice 
ministerial talks, which will start on 7 February in Washington.

  [Text] It was learned on 4 February that during a series 
of meetings with Japanese cabinet ministers, U.S. Trade 
Representative Kantor proposed that "Japanese and American 
politicians join delegations of the two countries to the 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks." 
  In a bid to hammer out an accord in the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks prior to the Japan-U.S. summit slated for 11 
February, vice ministerial talks will be held in Washington 
beginning 7 February. The United States is still critical of 
Japanese bureaucrats, saying, "No progress can be expected 
because of tough Japanese bureaucrats." Mr. Kantor's proposal is 
believed aimed at extracting concessions from Japan on the issue 
of setting numerical targets which have become a focal point at 
the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks by having Japanese 
cabinet ministers attend the talks. In response, the Japanese 
Government rejected Mr. Kantor's proposal, saying, "We do not 
want to bring any change to the way the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks are held," (says a senior official in the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry). As a result, vice 
ministerial officials from the two countries will hold the talks. 
  Speaking at a news conference on 4 February, Mr. Kantor 
said, 
"Foreign Minister Hata will lead the Japanese effort and he will 
assume the responsibility for the talks." In this way, Mr. 
Kantor talked as if the Foreign Minister had promised him during 
a meeting that he would assume the responsibility for the talks. 
In response, Japanese bureaucrats reacted against Mr. Kantor's 
statement, saying, "Foreign Minister Hata did not make that 
promise," and confirmed anew that mainly working-level officials 
will attend the talks.

Tachibana: "Japan Holds Tough, Reacts to Criticism of 
Bureaucrats -- Does Not Want To Repeat `Semiconductor' Mistake"; 
from NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 5 February Morning Edition] 
  [Text] Although not much time is left until the 
Japanese-U.S. summit meeting, by which time the Japanese-U.S. 
economic consultations are supposed to be concluded and to 
arrive at an agreement, a Japanese official in charge of 
negotiations kept on repeating firmly, "It is better to have no 
agreement than to make the wrong kind of concessions and to sow 
the seeds of misfortune in the future." Even the meetings 
between U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] Mickey Kantor, who 
arrived into Japan on 1 February, and Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata and Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade and 
industry, did not go beyond discussing basic things. 
  Even though Jeffrey Garten, U.S. under secretary of 
commerce, 
once said "we are not seeking numerical targets," the United 
States has proposed making trends and indicators objective 
criteria. Japanese officials in charge of the negotiations take 
such proposals as de facto numerical targets, saying, "The 
expressions may be different, but there is no difference in that 
they want future targets after all." 
  The reason why the Japanese officials are so rigid is 
because 
of their bad experiences. One of them is the Japanese-U.S. 
semiconductor agreement. Whereas it contained a figure of 20 
percent for foreign semiconductors' market share in Japan as the 
U.S. industry's hoped-for figure, before one knew what was 
happening, the U.S. Government started to say that it was a 
figure that the Japanese Government promised would be attained. 
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] said it 
will not retreat from its position, insisting: "We will never 
repeat the same kind of mistake. If we put numbers in an 
agreement, that will be interpreted as public pledge by the 
Japanese Government." 
  One of the reasons why the Japanese Government, which has 
kept on making concessions in past negotiations with the United 
States, now has taken so tough a stand is that the trade 
environment is greatly different following the conclusion of the 
GATT's Uruguay Round of talks at the end of last year. Its 
position is now that multinational trade rules have been 
established, "if a dispute arises between two countries, the 
right thing to do is to bring it to the GATT for open 
discussions." After deciding to partially open the rice market, 
which was a symbol of the closed nature of the Japanese market, 
Japan's guilty conscience has lessened as well. 
  "We won't tell them not to come. But they can't do anything 
even if they do come." [source not identified] The arrivals of 
cabinet-rank officials such as USTR Mickey Kantor -- on the 
heels of Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen -- are seen as an 
overbearing act ignoring the framework of negotiations now under 
way at the vice- ministerial level. The U.S. claim against 
Japan concerning Japanese "bureaucrats' impeding the progress of 
negotiations" has amplified Japanese bureaucrats' mistrust of 
the United States, and "we are now mutually distrustful of each 
other," said Sozaburo Okamatsu, deputy vice minister of 
international trade and industry. 
  But Japanese officials are perplexed as well. The MITI, 
working behind the scenes, is asking domestic automobile 
manufacturers to prepare voluntary plans on the purchase of 
foreign-made parts -- in hopes of finding a breakthrough in the 
framework talks on automobiles and auto parts. 
  The government wants to adopt a policy of not being involved 
directly in order to prevent any figures from turning into 
numerical targets, but there is no change in the fact that this 
is nontransparent administrative guidance. Such a practice 
weakens Japan's position on "not resorting to the practice of 
trade of a managed nature," and consequently it will be rather 
counterproductive to the negotiations.

<F P=106> [Article by Takashi Sakamoto, member of YOMIURI SHIMBUN </F>
Economic Department] 
  [Text] With the 11 February Japan-U.S. summit close at 
hand, Japan and the United States continue to have 
confrontations over the issue of setting "quantitative objective 
criteria" at Japan-U.S. economic framework talks for insurance 
services. That is because Japan is exercising strong 
precautions against the possibility that the United States may 
use the criteria as a numeric target in one sidedly forcing 
Japan to accept foreign-affiliated companies, which want to make 
inroads into the Japanese market. 
  With the summit just around the corner, the United States is 
strengthening its offense. Jeffrey Garten, under secretary of 
commerce, showed his hard-line stance, saying: "We have no 
intention to accept a bad agreement." Richard Gephardt, 
Democratic leader of the House of Representatives, said: 
"Numeric targets are needed (to liberate the Japanese market). 
The targets will become pressure as we seek changes in Japan." 
He is preparing to submit to Congress a bill designed to impose 
sanctions against Japan by onesidedly setting a target and 
thereby forcing Japan to liberate its markets, in case the 
comprehensive talks fail. 
  Together with automobiles and auto parts and government 
procurement, the insurance issue is one of the "three priority 
areas" which the United States is trying to settle in the 
summit, slated for 11 February. However, establishment of the 
"quantitative objective criteria" is the largest cause of the 
deadlock in negotiations for insurance services. Giving 
considerations to Japan's strong resistance, the United States 
is showing its flexible stance, saying that the "criteria is not 
accompanied by retaliation against Japan or a deadline for 
achieving goals." 
  However, when it comes to details of negotiations, the 
United States is trying to force Japan to increase the share of 
foreign- affiliated companies in the Japanese market to the 
level of their market share in other industrialized countries. 
In addition, it is rather obvious that the U.S. aim is to use 
the "quantitative objective criteria" as a lever to open up the 
Japanese markets. 
  Saying that an introduction of the numeric targets, 
including 
market share, runs counter to market liberalization and is 
linked to controlled trade, Japan is maintaining its stance that 
"establishment of the objective criteria, which is linked to an 
introduction of numeric targets, is absolutely unacceptable." 
  Some Finance Ministry officials are criticizing the United 
States, saying: "It will harm consumers' interests if the 
government issues an administrative guidance and recommends the 
consumer buy insurance from foreign-affiliated companies." 
"Establishment of the numeric targets is a lazy man's idea which 
takes no account of corporate efforts." 
  Japan is taking precautions against and showing its almost 
allergic reaction to the idea of setting numeric targets because 
it has gone through bitter experiences, such as the Japan-U.S. 
semiconductor accord. 
  Japan agreed that it would exert efforts to increase the 
share of foreign-made semiconductors to 20 percent in Japanese 
market. However, the U.S. Government and Congress, thinking that 
it was an "international pledge," were obsessed with this figure 
and forced Japan to buy more U.S.-made semiconductors while 
hinting at the possibility of imposing sanctions against Japan 
if it fails to reach the target. 
  Moreover, Japan is opposing the U.S. negotiations stance, 
which onesidedly concludes that "Japan is a closed market." 
  Certain improvement has been made for individual items of 
the 
insurance services. Among other things, Japan explained its 
plan to study various issues -- including the possibilities of 
securing transparency in issuing government approvals or 
licenses for new products and in setting insurance rates, and 
introducing the broker system, in which brokers can represent 
consumers to sign contracts with insurance companies -- from 
the viewpoint of reforming the overall system. 
  The Finance Ministry will stop its administrative practice 
of 
convoying Japanese industries and try to liberate the insurance 
market through easing government regulations. 
  However, the United States is asking Japan to delay 
liberalization of the so-called "third field" -- market for 
treatment of injuries and diseases, such as "cancer" and 
"Alzheimer's disease" insurance -- because American companies 
have an advantage over Japanese companies in this field in the 
Japanese market. Japan is strongly opposing this U.S. demand, 
saying: "It is obviously contradictory to call for a delay in 
liberalization of the only area where it has vested interests." 
  Opinions of both countries over Japan's "business 
practices only among affiliated companies" are still divided 
with no sign of finding a meeting point. 
  As a U.S. problem, Japan points out the licensing system 
issue, which varies from state to state. In addition, Japan 
also pointed out the following problems: discriminatory measures 
against other countries in the fields of government procurement 
and reinsurance practices, a clause which requires corporate 
executives to be U.S. citizens, and other discriminatory 
measures against foreign- affiliated companies. It seems that 
much more time is needed before both countries can find 
substantial solutions to these problems. 
  As was the case in setting objective criteria, mutual 
distrust underlies the rough going in the negotiations. 
However, the keywords of reaching an agreement are "transparent 
market that is open to domestic and foreign companies," 
"conditions of fair competition," and "expansion of consumers' 
choice." The Governments of Japan and the United States are 
required to iron out the differences.

<F P=106> [Article by Hitotsubashi University Professor Takatoshi Ito </F>
and Tokyo University Professors Motoshige Ito, Kazuo Ueda, and 
Masahiro Kawai; from "Economic Class" column -- "U.S. Demand for 
Setting Numerical Targets Runs Counter To Promotion of 
Competitiveness"] 
  [Text] 1) At the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, the 
United States has demanded that Japan set "numerical targets" 
for Japan's imports of specific goods and services and a share 
of foreign goods on the Japanese market. But the U.S. demand is 
a dangerous means that could lead to managed trade and the U.S. 
Government should withdraw the demand. We propose that the 
Japanese Government carry through its policy of absolutely 
opposing "numerical targets." 
  2) We are fully aware that Japan has the task of changing 
distribution business practices on the Japanese market, allowing 
more foreign access to the market in several sectors, relaxing 
bureaucratic regulations, simplifying the procedures for license 
and approval of new goods and services, and strengthening its 
general competitive policy. We believe that the U.S. choice of 
sectors for numerical targets is highly doubtful. Using 
numerical targets as a means to achieve a specific goal will 
precipitate a cartel among enterprises and strengthen the 
oversight authority of government ministries and agencies. As a 
result, numerical targets will backfire. 
  3) At bilateral negotiations and to the world, the Japanese 
Government should put forth a vision of how it plans to narrow 
price differentials between Japan and other nations, strengthen 
the Antimonopoly Law's enforcement, and what it plans to do with 
the Japanese economy. 
<H5>  Numerical Targets Have No Economics Basis </H5>
  At the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks presently under 
way, the United States has raised the issue of the closeness and 
intransparency of the Japanese market that stem from 
bureaucratic regulations and conventional business practices, 
and has asked Japan to increase imports and foreign access to 
the Japanese market. 
  To that end, the United States has pressed the Japanese 
Government and enterprises to set numerical targets for several 
sectors and businesses and to make a commitment to them. 
  There are many problems with the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks. However, the U.S. demand for setting numerical 
targets for three priority sectors has no economic grounds at 
all. Any attempt to use numerical targets as a means to settle 
trade disputes will do more harm than good to the interests of 
Japan and the healthy development of the world trade system. 
  So far, the Japanese Government has taken a passive attitude 
in negotiations with the United States. The Japanese Government 
has repeatedly decided to yield to U.S. demands, which, in an 
effort to avoid short-term frictions with the United States, has 
resulted in long-term damages to Japan. This are responsible 
for the latest U.S. demand for setting numerical targets. In 
handling the latest U.S. demand, the Japanese Government should 
not repeat its past mistakes by yielding to the U.S. demand that 
holds no economic rational. 
  Is it all right for Japan to simply say "no" to the U.S. 
demand for setting the numerical targets? 
  We do not think so. Japan needs to listen to foreign firms' 
criticism that "The Japanese market is closed and lacks 
transparency." To regain the economic vitality and make the 
life of Japanese consumers affluent, Japan needs to vigorously 
implement new projects, develop new goods, and further relax 
bureaucratic regulations. Japan should also exclude unfair 
business practices that lead to bid-rigging. 
  We are fully aware that Japan is faced with the task of 
changing the Japanese market's distribution business practices, 
allowing more foreign access to the market in several sectors, 
relaxing the bureaucratic regulations, simplifying the 
procedures for license and approval of new goods and services, 
and strengthening the general competitive policy. It is fully 
expected that once this task is accomplished, access for newly 
developed goods and services to the Japanese market will grow 
and the imports of manufactured goods to Japan and their share 
on the Japanese market in sectors in which foreign firms hold a 
competitive edge will grow. 
  We, however, do not believe that in bilateral negotiations 
with the United States, the discussion for something like "trade 
results" and "managed trade," that aim for Japan's commitment to 
foreign firms' access to the Japanese market, will be effective 
in revitalizing and internationalizing Japan's economy. 
  Japan should announce to the world that it will relax the 
bureaucratic regulations and adopt a thorough competitive policy 
that will serve the Japanese economy and should put it into 
effect without delay. To that end, Japan should adopt a new 
economic policy. In a bid to reduce Japan's current account 
surplus and open the Japanese market, the United States, during 
bilateral negotiations, has asked that Japan set numerical 
targets (for the share of foreign goods on the Japanese market 
and the amount and number of American-made goods on the market). 
This will lead to managed trade. The Japanese Government 
should resolutely say "no" to the U.S. demand. 
  If both Japan and the United States agree on numerical 
targets, the following problems will arise: 
  A) The act itself of the Japanese Government agreeing to 
numerical targets would be interpreted as Japan acknowledging 
"its difference from other nations." The act would reinforce 
the assertions by anti-Japan hard-liners in the United States. 
European nations and Australia would ask Japan for the same 
bilateral agreements. 
  B) If Japan agrees with the United States on setting 
numerical targets in a certain sector and the agreement is put 
into effect, this would inspire the United States to claim: "Now 
that the numerical targets are going well, let us expand them to 
other sectors," and would demand that it be done. If numerical 
targets are not met, it will spur the United States to assert 
that "Japan has not lived up to its promise and we have no 
choice but to slap sanctions against Japan." 
  C) Automobile and auto parts have become a priority sector 
in 
negotiations under the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. The 
primarily reason for a low share of American-built cars on the 
Japanese market lies in the failure of American automakers to 
manufacture cars that are salable on the Japanese market. The 
U.S. demand for more sales of American-built cars on the 
Japanese market holds no ground at all. The Japanese Government 
should not step back from its position of opposing the U.S. 
demand for setting the numerical targets in the automobile and 
auto parts sector. 
  D) Further more, the United States has no economic reason to 
push Japan for "numerical targets" in other sectors. Numerical 
targets run counter to the desirable policy of relaxing 
bureaucratic regulations and strengthening competitiveness. 
  E) If Japan devotes its time and energy to bilateral 
negotiations with the United States and yields to U.S. demands, 
this will have an adverse impact on Japanese and American 
feelings toward each other by reinforcing America-dislike among 
the Japanese and spurring Japan-bashing in the United States. 
That would also taint Japan's image among Asian nations and 
weaken Japan's leadership in multilateral negotiations. 
<H3>  Japan's Conventional Response To U.S. Demands Inspires U.S. 
To Make More Demands </H3>
  The Japanese Government must reflect on the fact that its 
conventional way of responding to U.S. demands has "encouraged" 
the United States to make its latest demand for setting 
numerical targets. The Japan-U.S. Semiconductor Agreement 
explicitly stipulates a target share of 20 percent of the 
foreign semiconductors on the Japanese chip market. The 
Japanese Government encouraged Japanese automakers to announce 
their plans for the purchase of American-made auto parts when 
former President Bush visited Japan in 1992. The Japanese 
Government also agreed with the United States during the 1993 
Tokyo summit that Japan would hold economic framework talks to 
discuss the question of setting numerical targets, which the 
United States had almost given up on at the time, and an accord 
would be concluded between the two countries at the end of the 
talks. This action was the Japanese Government's makeshift and 
short-sighted concession to the United States without 
considering long-term economic implications. 
  Given this history, it is quite natural that the view is 
surfacing in the United States that if it threatens Japan with 
"sanctions" and the "Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus 
Trade Act," Japan will go along with what the United States 
demands. The United States imposed retaliatory tariffs on 
Japanese-made semiconductors, citing Japan's breach of the 1987 
Japan-U.S. Semiconductor Agreement and called Japan an unfair 
trading nation based on the Super 301 provision of the 1988 
Omnibus Trade Act. Japan "accepted" the U.S. trade sanctions 
without taking its case to GATT. Japan-U.S. trade friction will 
be defused in a short period, but the Japanese Government's 
pusillanimous attitude will adversely affect Japan-U.S. 
relations in the long run. 
  If Japan insists on saying "no" (to the U.S. demand) and 
the United States takes hard-line measures (such as the revival 
of the Super 301 provision and one-sided sanctions), it would be 
possible for Japan to take such countermeasures as lodging a 
protest, taking the case to GATT, or taking retaliatory 
sanctions. Because the U.S. measures would be based on no 
economic justification or GATT procedures, Japan could expect 
sufficient political and public support for its protest or 
appeal. 
  However, if sanctions are imposed on Japan unilaterally for 
the reason that Japan cannot attain numerical goals after it has 
agreed to set numerical targets, the justification for Japan's 
insistence would be insufficient. In that case, the world's 
economists, as well as the "pro-Japanese" and "free trade 
supporters" in the United States, would take the view that 
"sanctions against the violation of promises are necessary." 
  There are some cases in past trade negotiations between 
European countries and the United States where the U.S. 
"sanctions" failed to bring about effects or retaliatory 
"sanctions" were imposed from both sides. As far as fair 
arguments are exchanged, "sanctions" or "retaliation" would not 
necessarily hurt a relationship of trust between the two 
countries. When taking into consideration the contents of the 
priority sectors in the ongoing economic framework talks, it 
cannot be guaranteed that if the United States should move to 
impose "sanctions" over the "automobile and auto parts" issue, 
public opinion in the United States or other countries would 
support it. 
<H3>  Strenuous Efforts Should Be Made To Narrow Disparities 
Between Domestic and Overseas Prices </H3>
  Is it appropriate for Japan to only says "no" to the demand 
for setting "numerical targets"? No, it is not. Japan, for its 
sake, should tackle its own economic restructuring, independent 
of bilateral negotiations. 
  What is necessary at first is to ease existing regulations 
and to strengthen competitive policies. Deregulation will 
create new business opportunities for domestic and foreign firms 
which want access to new businesses and will revitalize the 
market. This will be effective in invigorating the sluggish 
economy. 
  Moreover, the living standard reflecting the economic 
strength should be attained by adopting more consumer-oriented 
policies. The fact that domestic consumers' purchasing power is 
low because of the high prices for land and commodities has led 
to criticism from countries abroad that Japan must be doing 
something wrong or that it is dumping goods on foreign markets. 
If deregulation is promoted and the economic structure that 
fully satisfies consumers is established, most foreign criticism 
against Japan will become meaningless. 
  As a matter of course, the disparities between domestic and 
overseas prices should be narrowed through measures other than 
setting "numerical targets." If competition is sufficiently 
guaranteed in the distribution process, the differences between 
domestic and overseas prices that must be dealt with will be 
rectified automatically through market mechanism. In that 
sense, easing regulations and strengthening competitive policies 
(by cracking down on practices of soliciting price maintenance) 
is of great significance. 
  To that end, the Japanese Government should not make (or 
announce) a pledge in the bilateral negotiations, but rather, 
should display (to the world) the future direction of the 
Japanese economy. What is now being demanded is an effort to 
rectify the differences between domestic and overseas prices, an 
improvement of the social infrastructure, a strengthening of 
competitive policies, and implementation of thorough measures to 
deregulate the permission and authorization system -- for 
example, cracking down on "dango" [illegal bid-rigging 
practice], drastically easing regulations for setting up FM 
radio stations, liberalizing air fares and route rights, 
introducing competitive bidding, and assuring the freedom to 
enter and withdraw from various industries. 
  The strategy that the Japanese Government should take at 
present should be to indicate a long-term vision for 
restructuring the Japanese economy while continuing to say "no" 
to the demand for setting numerical targets. The Hosokawa 
administration has been given a good opportunity to adopt a new 
policy different from the past shortsighted policy toward the 
United States. We expect the Japanese Government to display 
strong leadership in promoting healthy development of the world 
trade system, to promote constructive dialogue between Japan and 
the United States, and to foster cooperation between the two 
countries from the long-term viewpoint.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Successful Conclusion of </F>
Japanese-U.S. Framework Talks Looks Difficult -- Japan's 
Economic Stimulus Package Trump Card Hits a Snag"; from MAINICHI 
SHIMBUN 6 February Morning Edition] 
  [Text] Are the talks heading for a settlement or a 
breakdown? With the Japanese-U.S. summit meeting on 11 February 
nearing, prospects for the Japanese-U.S. economic framework 
talks coming to a successful conclusion look extremely bad 
indeed. While talks on individual sectors are experiencing 
rough sailing, there is no telling when the economic stimulus 
package, which was supposed to have been Japan's trump card, 
will come into being. The vice- ministerial-level meeting to 
resume in Washington on 7 February is likely to be held in a 
gloomy mood. 
  The negotiations on individual sectors are progressing, 
albeit slowly. In talks in the area of government procurement 
(for telecommunications and medical equipment), an agreement is 
nearing as a result of Japan's concession on 5 February in 
agreeing to lower the amount of procurement to be subject to 
open bidding to 100,000 SDR's (IMF-set special drawing rights; 
equivalent to about 19 million yen). 
  But in the telecommunications market sector, a sharp 
confrontation persists between the two countries. While the 
United States demands that the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone 
Corporation (NTT) be included among organizations to be subject 
to open bidding for government procurement, Japan insists that 
"NTT is a private enterprise. The U.S. demand is absurd, and it 
does not conform to the GATT's rules, either." As far as 
procurement by NTT is concerned, Japan wants to satisfy the U.S. 
complaints only within the framework of the existing agreement. 
  In the area of insurance, holding a "two-way dialogue" was 
agreed on at the vice-ministerial-level talks in January. This 
means the two countries have agreed that the economic talks 
should address not only the problems of Japan and the question 
of how they should be resolved, but also the problems of the 
United States. In the United States, procedures for issuing 
permits for the insurance business differ by state, and this 
makes foreign companies' entry into that nation's market 
difficult. The two-way dialogue is expected to contribute to 
liberalizing the U.S. market. 
  With respect to the talks on automobiles and auto parts, 
Japan has also proposed easing rules on issuing permits which 
come under the jurisdiction of the Transportation Ministry. The 
United States, which has continued criticizing the current 
system as "a nontariff barrier to the export of finished 
automobiles," considers this a welcome proposal. 
  However, because of the scrapping of the plan for a 6 
trillion yen tax cut, the economic framework conference itself 
has become shaky. The most important purpose of the talks is to 
redress Japan's huge current accounts imbalance. Consequently, 
however difficult the talks on individual sectors might be, "the 
real key to the success of the talks lies in whether domestic 
demand could be expanded by coming up with a big economic 
stimulus package," (according to the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs). 
  The United States' "basis of evaluation" of the economic 
stimulus package is a "minimum of 5 trillion yen," a senior 
official of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
said. That being the case, the proposed economic package in the 
neighborhood of 15 trillion yen including tax cuts of 6 trillion 
yen would have been satisfactory to the United States from its 
position of wanting Japan to reduce its surplus by expanding 
domestic demand. 
  But the plan for tax cuts has been scrapped. As long as no 
action is be taken on the tax cuts and the budget, even if Japan 
pledges large-scale economic measures, this certainly would not 
be so persuasive to the United States. Besides, President 
Clinton's support for Prime Minister Hosokawa, who is for 
change, is very warm. As such, the government initially thought 
that "they wouldn't do anything to kick him off of a cliff" (to 
quote a government source), but the government is now concerned 
lest the president's evaluation of the prime minister should 
change as a result of this uproar over the tax plan and the 
subsequent scrapping of the plan. 
  Meanwhile, the numerical targets that the United States set 
out as objective criteria for measuring the openness of the 
Japanese market have become the biggest factor in making 
progress in the individual-sector talks difficult to attain. 
  In the negotiations on the government procurement of 
telecommunications equipment, the United States insisted, 
"Foreign products' share of the Japanese market is less than 5 
percent; over the next several years, it should be raised to 
about 20 percent, which is the level found in other 
industrialized nations." The United States wants Japan also to 
promise to "buy foreign products at levels comparable to those 
found in other industrialized nations" in the talks on 
insurance, automobiles and auto parts, and other sectors, which 
would be tantamount to presenting numerical targets in the form 
of market shares. 
  Japan then rejected this, insisting that doing such a thing 
is equivalent to practicing managed trade, and saying that "we 
can never agree to setting future targets" (to quote a 
government official). 
  Subsequently, the United States proposed using different 
expressions like "indicators" and "trends" to describe the 
"objective criteria." When U.S. officials thought they could 
not get their way by pushing for increased market shares, they 
switched to demanding assurances of "certain continuous rates of 
increase." 
  But Japan rejected the demand very completely, saying, 
"those 
are nothing more than numerical targets worded differently." 
Japan's position is that "the best it can agree to is to say 
that it will make efforts to increase the procurement of foreign 
products." But within the United States, there are strong 
sentiments like that of envoy Mickey Kantor which charge that 
"not one of the Japanese-U.S. agreements concluded in the past 
has been effective" and that that country is perplexed by the 
strong resistance being put up by Japan.

  [Text] While the United States has demanded that Japan 
implement income tax reduction, the implementation has now been 
taken back to the drawing board amid the current confusion on 
the tax system reform. In this connection, a top Foreign 
Ministry [MOF] official stated on the evening of 4 February: 
"If the prime minister cancels the upcoming Japan-U.S. summit 
meeting because of a failure to implement tax cuts, it will be 
questioned how other issues would be dealt with." Thus, the 
official indicated that Prime Minister Hosokawa's visit to the 
United States set for 10 February should take place even if no 
conclusion is reached on the tax cuts issue.

  [Text] Japan's economic relationship with the United 
States has become murky as the Japan-U.S. summit talks scheduled 
on 11 February are approaching. Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa has hammered out a plan to boost domestic demand by 
implementing a comprehensive pump-priming package centered on 
implementing tax cuts amounting to 6 trillion yen and 
introducing a national welfare tax system. However, while 
Hosokawa has been forced to make a complete turnaround and 
"rescind the plan for raising and cutting taxes," U.S. Trade 
Representative (USTR) Mickey Kantor has returned home without 
achieving his plan to reach a political compromise. What has 
been left behind is a damaged image of the prime minister due to 
his failure to exercise leadership. 
  "For the government to be thought of as being weak would be 
disadvantageous to Japan." These were words of concern uttered 
by a senior official of the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry [MITI] after watching the prime minister make a series 
of moves on the tax issue. 
  On the morning of 3 February, Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii 
briefed Kantor on government plans to boost domestic demand by 
implementing pump-priming measures. In response, Kantor said: 
"We hope they (the pump-priming measures) will help promote 
growth of the global economy." He had just finished making this 
comment when in less than 24 hours it was decided the government 
would start over from scratch on the tax measures. 
  The government hopes to somehow work out a pump-priming 
package, which includes tax measures, before the planned 
Japan-U.S. summit meeting. However, voices have been raised 
questioning "whether changing a plan, for which a news 
conference was even held, should be considered a mere matter of 
procedure," (as stated by a senior MITI official). Since, to 
begin with, the United States has expressed dissatisfaction at 
the size of the planned tax cuts, it is certain all the more 
that the U.S. Government holds doubts about the prime minister's 
leadership. 
  Japan has hoped that negotiations in the disputed sectoral 
trade issues, such as automobiles and auto parts, would proceed 
smoothly if it could achieve a certain level of success 
regarding macroeconomic measures. However, it seems this plan 
has completely fallen through. What has been made clear in 
Kantor's meetings with Japan's foreign minister, trade minister, 
and finance minister is the gap between Japan and the United 
States on numerical targets. 
  In a bid to seek a political compromise, the U.S. 
Government, 
which has complained that "trade negotiations are not 
progressing because Japanese bureaucrats are inflexible," has 
sent Kantor at a time when it felt that Prime Minister 
Hosokawa's leadership has reached the highest point so far with 
the passage of the political reform bills. However, retracting 
the announced tax measures has left no small impact on the 
United States.

  [Text] With the Japan-U.S. summit talks on 11 February 
close at hand, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's setback on the 
issue of the tax cut and the accompanying tax hike at the last 
minute has brought about a crisis of confidence in his 
"management ability" of the Japan-U.S. relations. This may 
dampen considerably the Clinton administration's expectations on 
the prime minister's leadership to reduce the trade surplus and 
open the Japanese market, which are significantly higher than 
its expectations on the previous Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] 
administration. 
  If Hosokawa visits the United States without bringing about 
a 
substantial breakthrough in the new economic consultations, the 
U.S. Government may reconsider its support of the prime 
minister's reform line. The United States is expected to stand 
firm on its position that "if there would not be any substantial 
agreement, it will be better not to have any agreement at all," 
(according to Secretary of the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen) If 
conflicts in Japan-U.S. relations flare up, the prime minister's 
political responsibility may be questioned. 
  The U.S. Government, which is irritated with the impasse in 
the new economic consultations, is plagued by a sense of 
distrust of the Japanese bureaucrats who stubbornly refuse to 
accede to the U.S. demand on "numerical targets," while it also 
harbors over- expectations on the ability of the prime minister, 
who upholds the slogan of "changing status quo politics." Since 
late 1993, U.S. Government officials have been trying to set the 
stage for bilateral negotiations by criticizing the bureaucrats, 
while expressing support for the prime minister. This is part 
of the strategy to set aside the prime minister as a so-called 
"good guy" to draw a favorable final "decision" from him. 
  However, the attitude taken by the prime minister in the 
process of formulating and eventually rescinding the "national 
welfare tax" scheme completely runs counter to U.S. 
expectations. At first, the prime minister had sided with the 
Ministry of Finance, which attaches more importance to a sound 
fiscal policy than to economic stimulation to please the United 
States, by proposing to implement a tax cut "two years" ahead of 
a tax hike. However, dissenting views came from the ruling 
parties, saying "With that, you cannot negotiate with President 
Clinton." Thus, the prime minister ultimately settled on "a tax 
hike three years later." However, this was sufficient to 
illustrate the prime minister's subservience to the bureaucracy. 
  On top of this, he had to rescind his own proposal. This 
seems to have also shocked the United States. After his second 
round of talks with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata on the morning 
of 4 February, when U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor was 
asked to comment on the volatile Japanese political situation 
during a news conference at the U.S. Embassy in Minato Ward, 
Tokyo, he replied, "We do not interfere in internal affairs. 
The situation is still volatile." However, he did not also 
pass over the chance to remind his audience that "the United 
States hopes for the implementation of strong, consistent 
economic stimulation measures." 
  Some government officials are even concerned now that the 
"nostalgia for the past LDP regimes' ability for internal 
coordination," which so far remains half-forgotten, may revive 
in the United States.

<F P=106> [By Michio Shioda] </F>
  [Text] Washington, 4 Feb -- The Clinton administration is 
sorely perplexed with Japan that does not care for "gaiatsu 
[outside pressure]." Commenting on this, an American newspaper 
recently said the U.S. pressure on Japan is "just like calling 
at a house on fire to notify someone about a PTA [parent-teacher 
association] meeting." 
  In the wake of the enactment of the political reform laws, 
U.S. President Bill Clinton dispatched U.S. Trade Representative 
(USTR) Mickey Kantor and Deputy Assistant to the President 
Bowman Cutter to Tokyo to directly apply pressure on Japan. 
Following Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's Tokyo visit, this 
was the second time the United States sent minister-level 
special envoys for the framework talks. This should be 
considered as President Clinton's clear signal of his desire for 
a "successful" conclusion of the Japan-U.S. summit talks. 
  As stressed by USTR Kantor, the United States says Japan's 
pump- priming package and market liberalization measures 
guaranteed by numerical targets are indispensable prerequisites 
for the successful conclusion of the summit talks. It appears 
U.S. negotiators have no intention to make concessions on that 
point. 
  On the other hand, Japan is still sticking to its position 
to 
consistently refuse "numerical targets." In connection with the 
pump-priming measures, the Japanese political scene is currently 
in confusion -- the coalition government might be dissolved over 
a proposal for the consumption tax hike. During the 3 February 
public hearing at the Congress, Under Secretary of Commerce 
Jeffrey Garten acknowledged the U.S. Government's view that the 
framework talks are more likely to fail. 
  The U.S. Government intends to finalize its strategy for 
negotiations with Japan after USTR Kantor's return home. Under 
Secretary of Commerce Garten said: "We will consider every 
possible option." 
  U.S. leaders often say "a bad agreement is what we do not 
need." President Clinton is the very person who criticized 
negotiation style of the former Republican administration and 
declared "result- oriented" approach must be applied to 
negotiations with Japan. 
  Yet, "gaiatsu," the United States' conventional weapon for 
negotiations with Japan, is losing its effect since Japan is 
busily occupied with a series of political crises. To say 
nothing of numerical targets, it is uncertain whether Japan can 
prepare the pump-priming package before the summit. While Japan 
has always been yielding to high-handed U.S. negotiators, the 
United States is becoming aware that such an approach may be a 
serious "mistake" this time.

  [Text] Japan-Russia meeting on defense policy and 
planning, which was held at the Foreign Ministry for two days, 
ended on 4 February. It was attended by officials in charge of 
defense and foreign policy affairs from the two countries. 
  At the meeting, the Japanese side pointed out that Russian 
forces in the Far East have become an unstable factor to the 
security of northeast Asian nations. In response, the Russian 
side stressed that Russia has continued its effort to promote 
disarmament and reduce its forces. At the meeting, the Russian 
side said that Russia hopes to join the Asia Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) forum. 
  Shunji Yanai, director general of the Foreign Policy Bureau 
in the Foreign Ministry, attended the meeting and Agayev, chief 
of the Analysis and Estimate Department in the Russian Foreign 
Ministry, and other Russian officials attended the meeting.

<F P=106> ["Core" column article by A. Portov in Vladivostok and </F>
Foreign News Department reporters Yoshihide Ito and Hitoshi 
Inokuma: "Russia, North Korea, and China Aim for the Same 
Economic Benefit -- Background of DPRK's Purchase of Worn-Out 
Submarines" ] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted on introduction] 
<H5>  Economic Conditions in Russia] </H5>
  Captain Liyazenchev [name as published], who has a high- 
sounding title as director of the Military Property Export 
Department of the Pacific Fleet Headquarters (and chief of the 
Management Bureau of the Resources External Affairs of the 
Russian Defense Ministry), is the officer who has signed a 
contract for export of submarines. During our interview, 
Captain Liyazenchev, who is in charge of export, received phone 
calls many times from a person whom we don't know and answered 
with annoyed look: "Delivery (of submarines to North Korea) is 
suspended for a while." 
  Under the contract, Russia is supposed to sell 12 submarines 
-- one each of Golf I and Golf II Class and 10 Foxtrot Class -- 
and these are all diesel-powered submarines. The Golf Class 
submarines are capable of carrying ballistic missiles. The 
Foxtrot Class can carry torpedoes and is an offensive submarine. 
Both the Golf Class and the Foxtrot Class were built in 1950's 
and 1960's, and the Golf Class has already been decommissioned. 
  The captain said "those submarines are scrap materials, and 
Russia will keep watch over how the submarines are dismantled," 
thus ruling out possible use of them as weapons by North Korea. 
He then stressed that the transactions are not illegal. One 
out of the 12 submarines was delivered to Nachin Port in North 
Korea last December. Nevertheless, Russia has suspended 
delivery of the rest of the submarines, and it seems that the 
reason for this is that it cannot categorically deny that North 
Korea will not use the scrapped submarines for military 
purposes. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Business Structure </H5>
  The contract documents specify that the submarines to be 
delivered to North Korea are "empty submarines," noting such 
devices as power plants were dismantled. It is also specified 
in the documents that: "The submarines shall be sold on the 
condition that they will be turned into iron scrap. The 
purchaser shall present a document certifying that the 
submarines are broken up." Thus the document endorses what 
Captain Liyanzenchev said. However, the problem is that the 
document specifies that the submarines will be dismantled not in 
Russia, but in North Korea. 
  Concerning this, Akiyoshi Shibata, president of Toen trade 
corporation, a party to the contract, explains: "It can be said 
that the contract has been concluded on the condition that the 
submarines will be dismantled in North Korea. Iron plates used 
in military warships and submarines are alloyed metal. But we 
cannot sell it at high prices because it contains a lot of 
impurities. The point is that we have to lower the cost for 
dismantling. In North Korea, the labor cost is dirt cheap." 
  According to the president, a bargain was originally 
proposed 
by North Korean trading firm called "Bondeisan" [as published], 
which the president says has business connections with his 
company. He said that although the North Korean trading firm 
had directly proceeded with negotiations on submarine 
transactions with the Russian Pacific Fleet, Russia had said to 
North Korea that "it cannot conclude a contract directly with 
North Korea" because North Korea's payment capability was 
doubtful. The president then said that his company concluded 
the contract for North Korea as an agent. In other words, 
actually, the submarines will be sold directly to North Korea. 
In return for its conclusion of the contract, Toen trading 
company has obtained the right to buy up scrap dismantled in 
North Korea and sell it to China. 
  It is estimated that Russia, North Korea, and Toen trading 
will be able to make a profit of $30-50 per ton respectively. 
[passage omitted] 
<H5>  View of Experts on Military Affairs </H5>
  [Passage omitted] 
  According to information obtained by TOKYO SHIMBUN, a North 
Korean high-ranking naval officer visited Moscow and Vladivostok 
last September, when negotiations on the submarine deal were in 
progress, and checked condition of the submarines. A person 
connected with the Russian military in Vladivostok said that "I 
wonder why he looked at the submarines so carefully which are to 
be sold as scrap materials." Moreover, the naval officer is 
directly involved in the signing of the contract. Meanwhile, 
South Korea, whose naval strength is said to be weak, purchased 
submarines from Germany last year, and it is reported that South 
Korea plans to promote the construction of home-made submarines 
with the aim of having 18 submarines in the future. 
  It is apparent that North Korea cannot remain indifferent to 
such a move by South Korea. Therefore, we wonder if the 
decommissioned submarines will be exported as "scrap" or 
"weapons."

<F P=106> [Article by Yukio Sato, Foreign Ministry North American </F>
Affairs Bureau director general: "Toward 1995 -- a Critical Year 
in Asian and Pacific Security"] 
  [Text] The issue of security in the Asia Pacific region 
has been relatively easy to handle until recently. The central 
issue has been how to develop a dialogue on security for the 
entire region. 
  Initially, Japan and the ASEAN countries agreed on the idea 
of utilizing the expanded ASEAN foreign ministers' conference, 
and other countries also agreed. 
  But from now on, the substance of what is to be achieved 
through dialogue will become the issue. It is anticipated that 
reconciling the opinions of the concerned countries will not be 
easy, including the treatment of concrete issues such as North 
Korea's (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) nuclear arms 
development. It is especially difficult because international 
politics in the Asia Pacific region is thought to be entering an 
era of full-fledged multinational consultation. 
  Under such circumstances, what kind of role should Japan 
play 
to secure peace in the Asia Pacific region and to promote 
economic development of countries in the region? That is the 
question we must now consider. 
  Over the last four years, I have been given the opportunity 
to think over security for the Asia Pacific region from a 
variety of angles. I want to remind readers in advance that 
what I am going to write in this article is my private opinion, 
based upon that experience. 
Japanese Response Has Changed -- From Opposing Soviet Proposals 
to Forming a 
<H5>  Consensus in the Region </H5>
  It was the Soviet Union which first took up the subject of 
security in the Asia Pacific region. The Soviet Union had 
proposed since the 1960's a series of Asian collective security 
concepts. Typical examples included, among others, 
Secretary-General Brezhnev's Asian Collective Security Plan and 
President Gorbachev's All Asia Collective Security Conference 
Plan. Each concept sought to create an organization similar to 
the CSCE (Conference on Security Cooperation of Europe) in the 
Asia Pacific region. It is easy to conceive that the aim was to 
interrupt the network of the Western alliance led by the United 
States, also keeping in mind the Soviet-Chinese confrontation. 
  On the other hand, various proposals have been made from the 
Western camp in recent years, namely The Northern Pacific 
Security Concept by Canadian Foreign Minister Clark, and the 
CSCA (Conference of Security Cooperation in Asia) by Evance, 
Australian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade. In the ASEAN 
countries, movements to hold international conferences on 
security issues have been emerging. 
  Given such currents, Japanese responses have changed. The 
turning point was President Gorbachev's visit to Japan in April 
1991. Up until then, the emphasis of the Japanese response had 
been placed on denying the validity of the Soviet's proposals; 
to that end the Japanese Government had been stressing how 
different the Asia Pacific region was from Europe. 
  The foreign policy speech Foreign Minister Nakayama made at 
the Diet three months prior (January 1991) to Gorbachev's visit 
to Japan summed up the government position at that time. That 
speech highlighted a number of basic points which needed to be 
recognized regarding security in the Asia Pacific region. 
Though it is a bit long, I want to quote a relevant portion [of 
the speech] as the premise for the argument I am going to make. 
  "I think that the time has now come to seriously examine the 
path to securing long term stability for the Asia Pacific 
region. It is natural that in this region the process for 
achieving that purpose is different from that in Europe. That 
is because the geo-political conditions and the environment for 
security in this region are significantly different from those 
of Europe. 
  "First, due also to the fact that many of the countries in 
the Asia Pacific region are developing countries, the greatest 
concern of each country is economic development. This is very 
different from Europe which so far has considered military 
detente and the threat of nuclear war to be the matters of 
greatest concern. 
  "Second, in Europe in the past, the East-West relationship 
existed in the polarized form of NATO and the Warsaw Pact. In 
contrast, in the Asia Pacific region, there are many elements 
which can not be subsumed under the East-West relationship, 
including the existence of China. International politics takes 
the form of multipolar power relations. Alliance relations in 
this area are mostly bilateral, and the conflicting interests 
and concomitant recognition of accompanying threat varies 
between individual countries. Consequently, the overall 
security situation is complex. 
  "Third, in contrast to the fact that in Europe the so-called 
CSCE process was initiated in an effort to resolve post-war 
boundary issues and so forth, in the Asia Pacific region, 
unsolved disputes and confrontations such as the North South 
confrontation on the Korean peninsula, Cambodia issue, and 
Northern Territories issue between Japan and the USSR are still 
present. 
  "And fourth, in Europe, there is a major movement toward 
unification, politically and economically, with the movement of 
the EC union at its center. But in the Asia Pacific region, 
relationships of economic mutual dependency are pursued on the 
basis of national, regional, political, social, and cultural 
diversity and differing phases of economic development. 
  To recognize such characteristics of the Asia-Pacific 
region and insure its peace and security, it is important to 
seek solutions for unsolved disputes and confrontations -- such 
as the confrontation on the Korean peninsula, the Cambodian 
issue, the Northern Territories issue, and so forth -- and 
through this process, to promote dialogue in order to bring 
about lasting stability in each subregion -- such as Northeast 
and Southeast Asia -- and to strengthen cooperative 
relationships. 
  As for regional cooperation in a broader sphere, in light of 
the fact that economic development is important for the 
stability of the countries in this area, it is important to 
promote cooperation stressing the economic sphere. In concrete 
terms, utilizing already existing frameworks -- such as ASEAN, 
the ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers' Conference, the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) ministers' conference, 
the Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference (PECC), and so on -- 
is the most suitable way for this region to expand dialogue and 
cooperation on various issues in the political and economic area. 
  President Gorbachev did not mention the usual Soviet 
proposals when he visited Japan. As a consequence, the 
Soviet-Japan dispute on security in the Asia-Pacific region 
ended for a time. Also, by then Australia and Canada had 
stopped talking about the "approach" which took the CSCE as a 
model. 
  But the issue did not end then. Among the countries 
involved, it has become important to create a consensus for an 
"approach" suitable to this region's actual circumstances. 
Recognizing this, Foreign Minister Nakayama made the following 
proposal, indicating Japanese thinking on Asian-Pacific regional 
security, at the ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers Conference (at 
Kuala Lumpur) held in July 1991, three months after the 
Gorbachev visit: 
  "What is necessary for the Asia-Pacific region is to 
comprehensively and in a multi-tiered manner utilize the various 
existing international cooperation arrangements which currently 
exist as well as the places of discussion, and to secure the 
long term security of this region.... If something is to be 
added to the already existing cooperation arrangements and 
frameworks as regards the areas of economic cooperation, foreign 
policy, and security, it should be a forum for political 
dialogue where friendly countries of this region can conduct 
frank exchanges of opinion on matters of mutual common 
interest.... 
  "The dialogue which the friendly countries would conduct in 
order to increase mutual feelings of security would also 
strengthen the political basis of mutually cooperative 
relationships. Such a political dialogue would be different in 
nature from confidence building measures intended to relax 
military tensions. 
  "Because of this recognition, it is significant and timely 
to 
utilize the ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers' Conference as a 
forum for political dialogue intended to increase feelings of 
mutual security. In order to make such political dialogue more 
effective, it may be useful to establish a site for a senior 
operational-level conference within the larger ASEAN, and to 
have the participants report the results of their discussion 
back to the larger ASEAN conference." 
  At that time, it was reported that U.S. Secretary of State 
Baker ignored this proposal, the ASEAN countries resisted it 
because they did not receive prior consultation, and in Japan 
not much attention was paid to the proposal. But the concept 
which the ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers' Conference adopted 
two years later -- in July 1993 -- at Singapore mirrored exactly 
the Nakayama proposal made at the Kuala Lumpur Conference. The 
contents of the concept were: 1) in order to discuss security 
for the entire region -- including China, Russia, Vietnam, and 
others -- a cabinet level ASEAN Regional Forum was to be 
established; and 2) prior to the cabinet members conference, a 
senior operational level conference (SOC) was to be held. 
  As for ASEAN countries not receiving prior consultation, 
there was some basis for that interpretation. But this proposal 
did not come out of blue for the ASEAN countries. About one 
month before the Kuala Lumpur Conference, I proposed to ASEAN 
officials in charge of the issue the idea of utilizing the ASEAN 
Expanded Foreign Ministers' Conference as a forum for political 
and security dialogue as well as for submitted papers. This 
conference was held following a decision of the ASEAN Foreign 
Ministers' Conference. As for my attendance, I had been invited 
by the Philippines Government, albeit in a private capacity, as 
the official in charge of the issue for the Japanese Government 
(as director general for the Information, Analysis, Research, 
and Planning Bureau). 
  On the other hand, there was also thinking within ASEAN that 
the political and security dialogue should be held at the ASEAN 
Expanded Foreign Ministers' Conference. Just before the Manila 
Conference, a conference was held in Jakarta. Those gathered 
were exclusively director-level personnel of security issues 
research institutions from the ASEAN countries. What I 
discovered by attending this conference was that the ASEAN 
scholars shared my thinking. One of the attendees, after 
hearing the Nakayama proposal, even said "the ASEAN scholars' 
contention was brought to governmental-level discussion through 
the speech of the Japanese foreign minister. Now the discussion 
will go forward." 
  As is clear from this story, as for the idea of utilizing 
the ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers' Conference as a forum for 
political and security dialogue, officials in Japan and the 
ASEAN countries came to the same conclusion, though they came 
from different positions. Moreover, anyone could come up with 
the idea of utilizing the ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers' 
Conference as a forum for such dialogue. What is important in 
the details surrounding this issue is that the idea emerged from 
within ASEAN and the opinion submitted by Japan, both mutually 
supporting each other, and thus became a consensus among 
nations, including such countries as the United States. 
  There is no doubt that Japan caused the United States to 
consent to this process, and thus was useful for helping the 
process go forward. It has also become clear that because Japan 
had a certain persuasive power, Asian countries would take into 
account what Japan had to say. 
<H5>  Making Overtures to the United States </H5>
  Secretary of State Baker's vague attitude toward the 
Nakayama 
proposal was somewhat unexpected because the bureaucratic 
offices of the U.S. Government, not to mention Secretary Baker, 
were well aware of and supported Japanese thinking. 
  We spent nearly one and a half years in completing the 
Nakayama proposal, repeatedly exchanging opinions and "papers" 
with officials in the State and Defense Departments as well as 
the White House. At that time, the concern of U.S. Government 
officials involved was focused on avoiding being pulled into 
naval disarmament negotiations in which the initiative would be 
taken by the Soviet Union. U.S. Government officials supported 
the following points, which were the core of the Japanese idea: 
1) as regards security in the Asia- Pacific region, we should 
take a "comprehensive approach," utilizing already-existing 
security treaties and other cooperation framework; 2) as for 
multilateral cooperation which is lacking in this region, we 
need to begin with political and security dialogue for the 
entire region, and for that purpose it is most realistic to 
utilize the ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers' Conference; and 3) 
the participation of China, the Soviet Union, and Vietnam -- 
among others -- should be given consideration only after 
conditions for doing so are in order. 
  I felt that, at a time when the U.S. Government and the 
American people were focused on East-West German reunification 
following the fall of the Berlin Wall, the spread of freedom in 
East Europe, reforms in the Soviet Union, and so forth, U.S. 
Government officials in charge of Asian policy preferred that 
Japan take the lead in developing a security dialogue in the 
Asia-Pacific region. 
  I once had a similar experience in the latter part of the 
1970's. Soon after the Vietnam war, when the mood permeated the 
United States that they did not ever want to be involved with 
Southeast Asian problems again -- a mood especially prevalent in 
the U.S. Congress -- Carter administration officials in charge 
of Asian policy welcomed Japan's active foreign policy which 
supported ASEAN, beginning when Prime Minister Fukuda visited 
ASEAN in 1976. The concerned U.S. officials, recognizing the 
Japanese Government was doing what the U.S. Government could not 
even if it wanted to, accepted the U.S.-Japan partnership toward 
ASEAN as "fruitful" for the United States (1979 Ohira-Carter 
joint statement). 
  Later, the Bush administration expressly agreed in the 
U.S.-Japan Global Partnership Plan issued in January 1992 to 
"promote political dialogue among the Asia-Pacific countries 
through an ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers' Conference." 
Still, the United States had little interest in this issue. 
Prime Minister Miyazawa's speech at the National Press Club in 
Washington in July 1992 was to impress the United States with 
the importance of security issues in the Asia- Pacific region. 
In this speech, Prime Minister Miyazawa first indicated his 
recognition that the existence of U.S. forces and the U.S.-Japan 
Security Treaty were the indispensable premise for stability in 
this region. He then advocated the so-called "two track 
approach," which is to concurrently promote both international 
cooperation aimed at solving disputes and confrontations in the 
Korean peninsula and Cambodia, and dialogue and cooperation for 
the entire region utilizing the ASEAN Expanded Foreign 
Ministers' Conference and APEC. 
  Incidentally, the political declaration at the Munich 
Summit, 
which was held right after this speech and which accepted the 
Japanese proposal, included the phrase "in the Asia-Pacific 
region, regional frameworks which already exist -- such as the 
ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers' Conference and APEC -- will 
play an important role in promoting peace and stability." This 
is the first such expression made at a summit meeting. 
<H5>  Policy Coordination Will Become More Difficult </H5>
  Japanese thinking concerning security matters in the 
Asia-Pacific region has been reflected to a considerable degree 
in the Clinton administration's policy. The Clinton 
administration has supported the idea of discussing political 
and security matters at the ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers' 
Conference, and has indicated that the multi-tiered approach of 
using already existing various organizations has promoted 
security in this region. This is precisely the same recognition 
we have. 
  Further, as I look back over the last year, the mutual 
understanding between the U.S. and Japanese Governments 
concerning the Asia-Pacific region was very good. On the issues 
of North Korean nuclear arms development, the PRC, Vietnam, 
peace in Cambodia, the ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers' 
Conference, and APEC, the Clinton administration has pursued 
policies which appeared to have fully taken into account 
Japanese thinking. On the one hand, this is the result of the 
Japanese Government taking the initiative and communicating its 
thinking to the new administration in advance. On the other 
hand, concerned officials in the Clinton administration have 
adopted a posture of listening to other countries' thinking -- 
Japan's in particular -- prior to solidifying U.S. positions. 
  But we must be prepared to accept the fact that the 
situation 
will be different in the future. The United States has a 
tendency, when it becomes interested in a certain issue, to set 
its own goals one after another and try to achieve them in a 
short time. A typical example is that President Clinton, as 
soon as he became aware of the importance of APEC, proposed to 
hold a summit-level conference. The U.S. advocacy of a "Pacific 
community" is the same sort of thing. 
  The Clinton administration is expected to have a greater 
interest in the Asia-Pacific region in the future. This is 
because the dynamic economic development possibilities in the 
Asia-Pacific region will be useful for the recovery of the U.S. 
economy and the expansion of employment in the United States. 
It is also because this economic benefit will provide suitable 
persuasion in battling the isolationism which is gaining 
strength in the United States. 
  That the United States is becoming more interested in the 
Asia- Pacific region is to be welcomed. But we must keep in 
mind there is a strong possibility that a gap could emerge 
between the policy objectives of the United States, the 
timetable to achieve those objectives, and what Japan and Asian 
countries feel are appropriate. 
  There is also the possibility that a lack of U.S. 
understanding of the Asian situation may come to the surface. 
There are not a few Americans who are thoroughly familiar with 
the Asian situation. The influence of Asian-Americans is 
increasing. But American society as a whole does not yet know 
about, and moreover has little interest in, Asia. 
  As for the aspect of adjusting policy between the United 
States and Japan, the past format in which the Japanese 
Government did what the U.S. Government could not do even if it 
wanted to, or that Japan took initiatives in areas where the 
U.S. had little interest, will not be possible. That is why it 
will be necessary more than ever for Japan to come up first with 
good ideas and take the initiative in bringing the United States 
along. 
  Policy adjustments with countries in the Asia-Pacific region 
are not easy either. The interests throughout this region are 
not the same; especially on security matters, the situation is 
significantly different between Northeast and Southeast Asia. 
Also, Asian countries, while paying close attention, are 
repelled by the strong arm tactics of the United States. As 
regards Japan, they are suspicious about our increased influence 
within the region, while at the same time expecting support from 
us. Moreover, multinational discussions and cooperation will be 
the center of regional cooperation in the future. Therefore, it 
is important to make step by step efforts to come up with a 
consensus in the region, even though it is time consuming. 
<H5>  Promote a Multifaceted Approach -- Five Objectives To Pursue </H5>
  As for the future approach, a "multi-faceted approach" 
designed to simultaneously pursue the following five objectives 
is important. 
  First, maintain the existing security framework and minimize 
uneasiness over security matters during this time of change. 
  Second, strengthen efforts to secure long term stability in 
areas where confrontations and disputes exist -- such as the 
Korean peninsula, the South China Sea, Cambodia, and so forth. 
  Third, strengthen regional cooperation in trade and 
economics 
in order to promote economic development in each country in the 
region. 
  Fourth, promote political and security dialogues throughout 
the region, and increase the feeling of security among 
individual countries within the region. 
  Fifth, strengthen the cooperative relationship between the 
United States, Japan, and China. 
  As a result of this "multifaceted approach," ideas may 
emerge 
for forming organizations or the machinery for security concerns 
within the region, or an international cooperation movement may 
arise which will satisfy specific objectives -- such as PKO, 
ocean patrols, or intelligence gathering for crisis management. 
But these are all future possibilities and depend on how the 
discussions will develop. Unlike in Europe, establishing 
objectives to be reached and setting forth arguments -- to form 
a collective defensive organization such as NATO or to form a 
collective security organization such as the CSCE -- are not 
suitable for this region. 
  The role Japan must perform in connection with each of these 
five objectives is significant. The U.S.-Japan partnership is 
the basis for everything. 
<H5>  (1) Stability of the U.S.-Japan Relationship </H5>
  It is not an exaggeration to say the stability of the 
relationship between the United States and Japan is the premise 
for peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region. But the 
relationship of these two countries is now in a very grave 
situation because of the trade and economic relationship. 
Suspicion and a wary mood are evident when the two sides talk 
about each other. 
  Overall, the relationship of mutual dependency between 
the United States and Japan has deepened to an historically 
unparalleled degree. Without doubt, the development of 
administrative reform in the political and economic field will 
increase U.S. trust in Japan. In fact, the active effort by the 
Hosokawa government on political reform and deregulation is 
received favorably in many sectors of the United States, 
starting with President Clinton. We can also expect, in the mid 
to long run, that suspicion directed against Japan by the U.S. 
public will decrease if the U.S. realizes an economic recovery 
and the American people regain their confidence. 
  The problem is in the short term. Frankly speaking, the 
problem lies in the excessively large Japanese surplus and the 
protectionism and isolationism which are gaining strength in 
American public opinion. Moreover, these are mutually related. 
To overcome such problems, we must bring the Uruguay Round to a 
successful conclusion and open up a bright prospect for the 
expansion of free trade. At the same time, we must shift the 
foundation of trade and economic relationships between the 
United States and Japan from confrontation to cooperation. 
  In this respect, it is important that Japan voluntarily 
adopts various reform measures, namely a counter-plan to improve 
business conditions, which includes tax system measures and 
deregulation. These measures should, fundamentally, be taken by 
Japan based on its own judgment and for its own needs. But 
these are also in response to the expectations of members of 
international society such as the United States. This is so 
much the case that if Japan executes these steps voluntarily, it 
will have the effect of making the negative image that "Japan 
can decide only under pressure from foreign countries" a thing 
of the past. 
  The "framework" discussion is also important. For its 
success, efforts by both the United States and Japan are 
necessary, and since it is a negotiation, what the outcome will 
be is a matter left to the future. But it is important that 
both the United States and Japan make progress in such a way 
that they can explain to their own people that the negotiations 
were successful. Three areas, governmental procurement, 
automobiles, and insurance, are especially important. It is not 
an exaggeration to say that success or failure of the third 
Hosokawa-Clinton meeting depends on the outcome of negotiation 
in these three areas. 
  As for security matters, on the other hand, Japanese support 
for the United States under the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty is 
receiving high marks not only from the U.S. Government, but also 
from the U.S. Congress. This is significant also for the entire 
Asia Pacific region because it is an important and persuasive 
argument to help secure support from the Congress to continue 
America's forward deployed strategy amid increasing calls for 
military budget reduction in the U.S. Congress. It is also 
important for the relationship of Japan and Asian countries to 
cause Asian countries, which desire the continued presence of 
the U.S. Forces, to deepen their understanding on this point. 
<H3>  (2) Promotion Of International Cooperation For The Sake Of 
Regional Stability </H3>
  In this area, North Korean nuclear arms development is the 
biggest issue now. Because the success or failure of the 
nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty depends on this, it also has 
world-wide significance. What is desired from the countries 
involved -- Japan, the United States, and South Korea among 
others -- is the use of all diplomatic means to cause the North 
Koreans to give up nuclear arms development through dialogue. 
  On the other hand, to increase regional cooperation to 
secure 
long term stability in Northeast Asia is a subject we must think 
about now. In this respect, the fact that the U.S.-Japan-South 
Korean cooperative relationship has increased, with the North 
Korean nuclear arms development as the occasion, and that China 
and Russia share apprehension about the danger of nuclear arms 
proliferation on the Korean peninsula, may lead to something. 
  Naturally, the five countries, Japan, the United States, 
South Korea, China, and Russia should not unite to exclude North 
Korea. Regional cooperation for the stability of Northeast Asia 
must work in a direction which promotes stability on the Korean 
peninsula and the reconciliation of North and South. In that 
sense, the door must be left open for North Korea [when we talk 
about] cooperation in this region. 
  Moreover, the situation in the South China Sea is still 
unstable, and the peace in Cambodia is still fragile. 
Cooperating with the ASEAN countries, the United States, China, 
and Vietnam, consideration of a framework to secure long term 
stability in East Asia is also one of the future tasks for 
Japanese foreign policy. 
<H5>  (3) Economic Development in Asia Pacific Region </H5>
  The promotion of economic growth for the Asia Pacific region 
is not only indispensable for the stability of this region, but 
also is significant for the world economy. Moreover, the 
economy of the Asia Pacific region, including China and Vietnam, 
is expanding. To build a relationship of cooperation in this 
region, which is based on the principles of free trade and is 
open to the outside, is the task given today. As for the place 
of discussion for this purpose, APEC exists. We can say that 
the unofficial conference at the heads of government level which 
was held in Seattle last November gave a good start for 
cooperation in the trade and economic area among the countries 
in this region. 
  The part Japan can play in the economic area is 
significant because Japanese economic aid, investment, 
technology, and the Japanese market are indispensable for the 
further expansion and development of the Asia Pacific economy. 
<H5>  (4) Heightened Feeling of Security </H5>
  As for the area wide political and security dialogue, the 
ASEAN regional forum, which is starting this year is expected to 
play a central part. I want to point out here the importance of 
the notion of "elevating the feeling of security," which Japan 
has been advocating so far. 
  Often the term "confidence-building" is used. This concept 
was born in the process of the East West negotiations during the 
Cold War, and basically, its objective was to reduce the risk of 
war between opposing camps. That may be the reason to inform 
each other prior to military exercises and large scale movement 
of troops and to permit aerial reconnaissance to form the 
nucleus of so-called "confidence-building measures." Where this 
is necessary in Asia may only be on the Korean peninsula. 
  The Asian countries do not view each other as antagonists. 
On the other hand, because of historical particulars and 
geographical proximity, differences in country size, and so 
forth, it is difficult to erase mutual suspicion and mistrust 
among the Asian countries. The point is clear when one looks at 
the relationships between Japan and South Korea, and Japan and 
China. The situation is similar between China and Southeast 
Asia, and Vietnam and its neighboring countries. Further, in 
the past several years, three uncertainties or apprehensions, 
namely "how far will the United States reduce its presence?", 
"How much will Japan strengthen its influence?", and "How much 
will China expand its military power?" have increased. 
  Reducing such suspicion, mistrust, uncertainty, and 
apprehension is basic to the Asia Pacific region's security. 
For that purpose, dialogue among countries to discuss 
everything is, above all else, important. Also, it is important 
to further the cooperation through dialogue within the region to 
raise the transparency of military budgets and the defense 
policy of each country, to make clear the actual situation of 
arms imports and exports, to place further regulations on the 
transfer of conventional arms, and to prevent the proliferation 
of mass destruction weapons such as nuclear ones. 
  But we should not just stop at such measures in the military 
field. It has a significant meaning for raising a mutual sense 
of security to think about, for example, worrisome matters which 
are common to all countries in areas such as environmental and 
refugee issues, and to cooperate for the solution of such 
problems. It is equally important to increase mutual 
understanding through measures such as cultural exchange, 
academic exchange, and student exchange. Also, the efforts Japan 
is making concerning the teaching of history for future 
generations will provide a sense of security for people who feel 
uneasy about a future Japan. 
  What the countries in this region must do to increase the 
sense of security among themselves goes far beyond the so-called 
"confidence-building measures." Also, to increase the sense of 
security, it is important not only [to adopt] measures among the 
governments, but also to have dialogue and cooperation in the 
private sectors. Especially, when one thinks of the 
relationship between China and Taiwan, the North Korean 
participation issue, and the importance of obtaining fresh ideas 
not constrained by existing policy, we can not stress too much 
the importance of non- governmental level dialogue and 
cooperation 
  The main role of the ASEAN regional forum seems to be to 
stimulate and promote such wide ranging efforts. 
<H5>  (5) Stability of U.S.-Japan-China Relationship </H5>
  The direction the future U.S.-China-Japan relationship will 
take will have a great influence on the future of the Asia 
Pacific region. In that sense, the emergence of signs of the 
improvement in U.S.-Chinese relations is to be welcomed. The 
Clinton administration, out of consideration for the broader 
perspective on the U.S.-China relationship, is also beginning to 
take a posture to improve U.S.-China relations, while showing a 
strong political interest in securing Chinese cooperation 
concerning the protection of fundamental human rights and 
nuclear non-proliferation policy. The Clinton-Jiang Zemin 
meeting in Seattle was considered to be one of the great 
opportunities in attempting to make progress on the U.S.-China 
relationship. 
  The objectives and substance of policy toward China are, 
naturally, different for Japan and for the United States. But 
just as they are constructive partners concerning the issues on 
the Asia Pacific region and global political and economic 
issues, to work on [to influence] China is a task common to both 
Japan and the United States. It will become more and more 
important for the United States and Japan to pursue this common 
task, while keeping in close touch with each other and keeping 
Clinton's [proposed] visit to China in mind. 
  Also, it is true that Russia could play a constructive 
part in this region. But for now, it is necessary to make a 
case- by-case judgment on what sort of part Russia should play. 
Also, Russia must have a better understanding that, to play a 
political part in this region, it is important to solve the 
Northern Territories issue and totally normalize the 
Russo-Japanese relationship. 
<H5>  Five Important Items for 1995 -- What Japan Must Do </H5>
  In international politics it is extremely important to have 
good timing. In that sense, next year will be a great chance 
for Japan to take bold initiatives for the peace and prosperity 
of the Asia Pacific region. A number of important events and 
opportunities relevant to Japanese relationships in this region 
will arise that year. We must start making preparation now. 
  First, 1995 is the 50th year since the end of the Pacific 
War. Therefore, people of the countries which were involved in 
the war will be looking back to that period, filled with 
emotions. Also, for the Korean peninsula residents, which had 
been annexed by Japan prior to the war, 15 August 1945 is the 
memorial day at which time they gained independence from the 
Japanese control which spanned over 36 years. The year 1995 
also happens to be the 30th year since the establishment of 
diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea. 
  The fact that Japan will declare its resolve to pass on what 
history taught to future generations, will strengthen the moral 
foundation of future Japanese foreign policy. But it is not 
enough to reflect on and self-examine the past. It is extremely 
important to begin taking action which will become the point of 
departure for further securing the peace and prosperity of the 
Asia Pacific region. To provide a bright prospect for the 
security of the Asia Pacific region is its greatest given task. 
  At the same time, the Japanese may give thought on this 
occasion to starting a large scale exchange plan funded by 
Japan, similar to the Fulbright Program and the Rhodes 
Scholarship, in an attempt to promote mutual understanding and 
exchange among the people who will be the support and driving 
force for the future of this region. 
  Second, 1995 is the 50th year since the atomic bomb was 
dropped in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Moreover, the issue of 
extending the nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty will be examined 
internationally. 
  Japan, as the only country which suffered bombing by a 
[nuclear] weapon, is in the position to take the leadership for 
promotion of nuclear disarmament. In that sense, I think, it 
may be an idea to plan some [event] in Japan, at which the 
strict nuclear non-proliferation and the promotion of nuclear 
arms reduction are to be pledged by the [participants] which 
include the nuclear possessing countries headed by the United 
States. 
  Third, 1995 is the 50th anniversary since the founding of 
the 
United Nations. Therefore, it will be a year some answers on 
issues such as strengthening the United Nations and the 
reorganization of the Security Council will be sought 
internationally. I am hoping that at that time, the Asia 
Pacific counties will provide active support for Japan to become 
a permanent member of the Security Council. 
  What Japan has to do now is to express its thoughts on ways 
to strengthen the United Nations in the post Cold War world and, 
to that end, to [spell out] what kind of responsibilities and 
what part Japan should carry out. Japan, as a non-nuclear 
possessing country and the only sufferer of the [nuclear] bomb, 
has the responsibility and the duty to consider the world's 
security from a perspective different from the permanent 
Security Council member countries. 
  On the other hand, strengthening the UN international 
security function is connected to the security of Japan itself 
and to the security of the Asia Pacific region. This is an 
important point we must not forget when we consider 
strengthening UN functions. 
  The review of our International Peace Cooperation Law three 
years after it was put into force will also be made in 1995. 
Needless to say, this review must be conducted, in conjunction 
with the strengthening of the United Nations, in terms of 
examining the role Japan has to play in it. 
  Fourth, 1995 will also be an important year for the 
U.S.-Japan relationship, because both the review of the 
"framework" negotiations in the economic area and the review of 
the special agreement concerning the share of expenses for U.S. 
Forces in Japan will be made that year. 
  The current special agreement (valid for five years) 
concerning expenses for U.S. Forces in Japan will expire in 
March 1996. If the same measures are to be continued after 
April 1996, it will be necessary to conclude a new agreement 
between the United States and Japan and to start making 
preparations in 1995 for the process to obtain the Diet's 
consent. 
  The necessity to do that is already clear. Though the Cold 
War is over, Russia and China remain as nuclear possessing 
countries, and North Korea's nuclear development issue is also 
present. There is also a continuous rumor that China is 
attempting to strengthen its naval forces. The armed 
confrontation in the Korean peninsula is continuing and the 
territorial dispute in the South China Sea contains the danger 
of an armed struggle. 
  Under such circumstances, for Japan to firmly adhere to the- 
no- nuclear-arms three principles and to the policy of not 
becoming a military power which might threaten other countries, 
while protecting its security, the American nuclear umbrella and 
the presence of U.S. Forces in the Asia Pacific are 
indispensable. What Japan can do in return for U.S. cooperation 
is provision [offer] of bases and financial support for the U.S. 
Forces. 
  On the other hand, efforts are necessary to solve various 
problems which accompany the presence of the U.S. Forces. In 
Okinawa, where the U.S. bases are concentrated, the vocal desire 
for the consolidation of the bases is strong. Also, everywhere 
in Japan, from the residents around the bases, complaints are 
loudly heard about aircraft noise, especially night time 
landings by aircraft carrier based airplanes. They are also 
uneasy about the environmental problems related to the [presence 
of] the U.S. bases. Therefore, to continue the support of the 
United States under the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, it is 
important to make visible progress on U.S. base consolidation 
and on reducing the impact U.S. Forces' activities have on the 
lives of the population [living around the bases]. 
  It is the responsibility of both the United States and Japan 
to strengthen the relationship of cooperation both in the trade 
and economy and the political and security areas, and to make 
efforts to provide a sense of security to the future of the Asia 
Pacific region. Also, I want to point out that, conversely, 
cooperating for the common goal which further solidifies peace 
and prosperity of the Asia Pacific region will further open a 
new phase in the partnership between the United States and Japan. 
  And fifth, in 1995 the APEC ministers meeting will be held 
in 
Japan. This is a year when countries in the Asia Pacific region 
will be looking back at the past with various emotions and 
thinking about the future. This will be a great opportunity for 
Japan to take the initiative toward the Asia Pacific region. To 
make use of the opportunity, in addition to strengthening 
cooperation in the trade and economic area which is the original 
purpose of APEC, it is important for Japan to take the 
initiative on issues ranging from nuclear disarmament to youth 
exchange, both within and outside APEC. It goes without saying 
that all such Japanese efforts will lead to increased feelings 
of security and trust toward Japan by the countries in the Asia 
Pacific region.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] At a news conference held on the afternoon of 31 
January, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General 
Ichiro Ozawa touched on the ruling coalition parties' future 
relationship with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], and said: 
"If the opposition comes up with a better idea, we should revise 
our plans without trying to save face. Even the budget drafting 
is no exception." In this way, he indicated the ruling 
coalition should take a free and unbiased stance in working out 
policies. However, regarding the possibility of forming "a 
wide-range alliance" with the LDP, Ozawa clearly denied this, 
and said: "If such an alliance were formed, there would be only 
one political force as before. One advantage of the current 
situation lies in the fact that while more than two political 
groups are cooperating with one another based on a free and 
unbiased stance, if one group fails in promoting its 
administration, another can take over." 
  When asked about how the ruling coalition should cooperate 
in 
the next election under the new electoral system following 
passage of the political reform bill, Ozawa pointed out: 1) The 
five major ruling coalition parties are bound to be defeated if 
they conduct their election campaigns without cooperation; 2) to 
say nothing of the fact that the coalition's ultimate objective 
in forming a thorough-going cooperative network lies in 
functioning as if they were one party, it should strive to 
establish a framework for promoting thorough-going cooperation; 
and 3) such cooperation among coalition parties will be tested 
for the first time in the election for the House of Councillors 
next summer (if no general election is held in the meantime). 
Thus, while keeping the next House of Councillors election in 
mind, Ozawa indicated his intention to quickly lay the 
groundwork for cooperation among the ruling parties. 
  As for the timing of holding the next general election, 
Ozawa 
indicated his negative view on early dissolution of the House of 
Representatives, saying: "It is not necessarily logical to hold 
the general election as soon as possible just because of changes 
in the electoral system." 
  In response to a question as to why Ozawa excluded reporters 
of SHUKAN GENDAI (published by Kodansha) from the news 
conference, he stated: "I may file a suit against SHUKAN GENDAI. 
I have asked my counselor to study the case." Furthermore, he 
added: "My secretary will also file a suit against Tokyo Sports, 
(a newspaper publishing company), and we will fight it in the 
courts."

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of </F>
the Liberal Democratic Party, by unidentified NIHON KEIZAI 
SHIMBUN reporter on 3 February; place not given] 
  [Text] Yoshiro Mori, secretary-general of the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP], gave an interview to a NIHON KEIZAI 
SHIMBUN reporter on 3 February. Commenting on Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa's idea of introducing the national welfare 
tax, Mori stated: "The goal of the financial authorities is to 
increase the consumption tax. That counters our demand that 
income tax reductions be implemented to stimulate the slumping 
economy. The proposed rate of 7 percent for the welfare tax 
means the government will make clear gains after stop-gap 
national bonds are reimbursed." The LDP secretary general thus 
expressed his opposition to the idea of introducing a national 
welfare tax. Regarding the procedure for deciding on the new 
tax plan, Mori severely criticized the government stance, 
saying: "The problem is the government is being led by the 
Ministry of Finance. We see the weakness in deciding on the 
policies of the Hosokawa administration which fails to assert 
that the consumption tax should not be increased at the expense 
of implementing tax reductions." 
  On the LDP's future policies toward the Hosokawa 
administration, Mori said: "At the recent meeting with Prime 
Minister Hosokawa, Kono did not accept the prime minister's call 
for holding such meetings repeatedly." Thus he denied the 
possibility of taking a cooperative line with the coalition 
administration. At the same time, Mori said: "Boycotting the 
Diet sessions last time did not prove to our advantage, and we 
have lost trust in the LDP. Taking the stance of opposing all 
policies and fighting against them is inappropriate." Mori 
stressed that the LDP would take a free and unbiased stance 
depending on the policies, while maintaining a certain distance 
from the coalition administration for the time being.

<F P=106> [Article by Akira Onishi, chairman, Soka University </F>
Engineering Department] 
  [Text] How would Japan's economy actually be affected 
if the Hosokawa administration were to embark on a decrease in 
income taxes and an increase in the consumption tax? The author, 
who specializes in using computers for evaluations of future 
events, did a simulation. 
  Japan in a Global Context 
  Estimates concerning the future of Japan's economy are being 
done using various techniques, but it is thought that the global 
modeling which the author is researching is particularly 
worthwhile. 
  Global modeling is not a specialized knowledge that relates 
only to the specific field of economics, but has its greatest 
distinction in the fact that it is a super interdisciplinary 
field of study. For the purpose of taking countermeasures on and 
solving global problems that human society is confronted with, 
it is essential to supply information by future forecast 
simulations using global modeling. 
  The FUGI (Futures of Global Interdependence) global model 
introduced here classifies the world into 80 countries or 
regions. It is a global model in which each country or regional 
group model is mutually dependent on a global scale. 
  At present, the computer being used to calculate this model 
is the IBM-RISC 6000 workstation and the software used is the 
FGM/FUGI-GEMS, developed independently. 
  Using this model, the results of a forecast based on 
reductions in income tax and increases in the consumption tax in 
the Japanese economy from 1993 to 2000 have been shown in the 
table. 
  In making this forecast, a standard forecast was first 
performed. A standard forecast is one in which past data and 
structural parameters of a model inferred from that data is 
based on the assumption that there will not be drastic changes 
in the future. Herein, the economic countermeasures executed up 
to now by the Japanese Government have already been interwoven, 
and gradual removal of nontariff barriers due to loosening of 
import restrictions is also taken into consideration. Also, it 
anticipates that oil prices which were $17.3 per barrel in 1992 
will be $21 per barrel in 2000.

Notes: 1. The gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate is the actual calendar year 
growth rate at 1985 constant prices. 2. Income tax cuts will start one year from now in 
1994, and the current 3 percent consumption tax rate will be raised in 1995. 3. This 
simulation is a policy scenario in which only tax rates are changed and the consumption 
tax system remains the same. 


  Scenario A: 5 Trillion Yen Individual Income Tax 
Reduction and an Increase in the Consumption Tax to 5 
Percent 
  This forecast simulation of the Japanese economy is based on 
a policy scenario in which the government, grappling with 
economic countermeasures and modifications of indirect tax 
rates, decreases personal income taxes 5 trillion yen, aiming to 
reduce the ratio of indirect tax starting in fiscal year 1994. 
At the same time, utilizing the strong yen and easing import 
restrictions to prevent a drop in economic growth due to a hike 
in consumption taxes, it raises the consumption tax from 3 
percent to 5 percent beginning in fiscal year 1995. 
  According to this forecast simulation, the growth rate of 
Japan's economy will increase 0.30 percentage points (rounded to 
the nearest hundredth) in 1994 compared to the standard 
forecast, but by raising the consumption tax 2 percent there 
would be a 0.00 percentage point decline in 1995 and, further, a 
0.20 percentage point decline in 1996. Beginning in 1997 until 
2000 the growth rate would recover and an increase with respect 
to the standard forecast of an increase of 0.07 percent to 0.01 
percent could be expected. The rate of increase in consumer 
prices would rise 1.10 percentage points in 1995 when the 
consumption tax is implemented compared to the standard 
forecast, and rise to between 1.8 percent and 2.9 percent, but 
after that it will converge with the 2-percent growth track of 
the standard forecast on into the year 2000. 
  In 1995, due to the 2-percent increase in the consumption 
tax 
rate, 4.8 trillion yen in increased revenue from the consumption 
tax would be anticipated. Since the amount of expected revenue 
increase in 1996 would be 5.1 trillion yen; in 1997, 5.4 
trillion yen; 1998, 5.7 trillion yen; 1999, 6.1 trillion yen; 
2000, 6.6 trillion yen, the amount of increased consumption tax 
revenues would exceed the amount of reduction in income tax, and 
in 1999 the national finance would achieve a sound condition. 
  Scenario B: 7.5 Trillion Yen Individual Income Tax 
Reduction and a Consumption Tax Increase to 6 Percent 
  This forecast simulation of the Japanese economy is based on 
a policy in which the government attempts to reduce the ratio of 
indirect taxes by a reduction of the individual income tax of 
7.5 trillion yen beginning in fiscal year 1994. At the same 
time, utilizing the strong yen and easing import restrictions to 
prevent a drop in economic growth due to a hike in consumption 
taxes, it would raise the consumption tax from 3 percent to 6 
percent beginning in fiscal year 1995. 
  According to this forecast simulation, although the growth 
rate of the Japanese economy will probably rise 0.45 percentage 
points in 1994 compared to the standard forecast, the 3-percent 
increase in the consumption tax rate will likely lead to a 0.01 
percentage point decrease in 1995 and a 0.30 percentage point 
decrease in 1996. It is expected that there would be increases 
from 1997 until 2000 of 0.11 percent, 0.02 percent, 0.02 
percent, and 0.01 percent. The consumer price rate would appear 
to increase 1.58 percentage points in 1995 when the consumption 
tax rate is hiked compared to the standard forecast, and would 
increase to between 1.8 percent to 3.4 percent, but later it 
would converge with a growth course of the standard forecast of 
about 2 percent. 
  It is expected that there would be increased revenue of 7.2 
trillion yen from consumption taxes due to the hike in the 
consumption tax in 1995. Since it could be expected that the 
increased revenue in 1996 would be 7.7 trillion yen; in 1997, 
8.1 trillion yen; in 1998, 8.7 trillion yen; in 1999, 9.2 
trillion yen; and in 2000, 9.9 trillion yen, the increased 
revenue from the consumption tax would exceed the amount of 
increased revenue from the income tax, so national finances 
would be converted to a sound condition in 1998. 
  Scenario C: 10 Trillion Yen Individual Income Tax 
Reduction and a Consumption Tax Increase to 7 Percent 
  This forecast simulation of the Japanese economy is based on 
a policy scenario in which the government attempts to reduce the 
ratio of indirect taxes by performing a reduction in individual 
income tax of 10 trillion yen beginning in fiscal year 1994. At 
the same time, utilizing the strong yen and easing import 
restrictions to prevent a drop in economic growth due to a hike 
in consumption taxes, it would raise the consumption tax from 3 
percent to 7 percent beginning in fiscal year 1995. 
  According to this forecast simulation, although the growth 
rate of the Japanese economy will probably rise 0.61 percentage 
points in 1994 compared to the standard forecast, the 4-percent 
increase in the consumption tax rate will likely lead to a 0.01 
percent decrease in 1995 and a 0.40 percent decrease in 1996. It 
is expected that there would be increases from 1997 until 2000 
of 0.14 percent, 0.02 percent, 0.03 percent, and 0.02 percent. 
The rate of increase in consumer prices would appear to increase 
2.10 percent in 1995 when the consumption tax rate is hiked in 
1995 compared to the standard forecast, and would increase to 
between 1.8 percent to 3.9 percent, but later it would converge 
with the growth track of the standard forecast of about 2 
percent. 
  It is expected that there would be increased revenue from 
consumption taxes of 9.7 trillion yen due to the 4-percent hike 
in the consumption tax in 1995. Since it could be expected that 
the amount of increased revenue in 1996 would be 10.3 trillion 
yen; in 1997, 10.9 trillion yen; in 1998, 11.6 trillion yen; in 
1999, 12.3 trillion yen; and in 2000, 13.3 trillion yen, the 
increased revenue from consumption tax would exceed the amount 
of reduction in income tax, and in 1999 the national finance 
would achieve a sound condition. 
  Scenario D: 7.5 Trillion Yen Individual Income Tax 
Reduction (5 Trillion Yen Cut in Individual Income Tax + 2.5 
Trillion Yen Cut in Corporate Income Tax) and a Consumption Tax 
Increase to 6 Percent 
  This forecast simulation of the Japanese economy is based on 
a policy scenario in which the government attempts to reduce the 
ratio of indirect taxes by implementing a reduction in 
individual income tax of 5 trillion yen and a reduction in 
corporate income tax of 2.5 trillion yen beginning in fiscal 
year 1994. At the same time, utilizing the strong yen and easing 
import restrictions to prevent a drop in economic growth due to 
a hike in consumption taxes, it would raise the consumption tax 
from 3 percent to 6 percent beginning in fiscal year 1995. 
  According to this forecast simulation, although the growth 
rate of the Japanese economy will probably rise 0.46 percent in 
1994 compared to the standard forecast, the 3-percent increase 
in the consumption tax rate will likely lead to a 0.01 percent 
decrease in 1995 and a 0.18 percent decrease in 1996. It is 
expected that there would be increases from 1997 until 1999 of 
0.15 percent, 0.02 percent, and 0.00 percent, but a 0.02 percent 
decline in 2000. The rate of increase in consumer prices would 
appear to increase 1.57 percentage points in 1995 when the 
consumption tax rate is hiked in 1995 compared to the standard 
forecast, and would increase to between 1.8 percent to 3.4 
percent, but later it would converge with a growth course of the 
standard forecast of about 2 percent. 
  It is expected that there would be increased revenue from 
consumption taxes of 7.2 trillion yen due to the 3-percent hike 
in the consumption tax in 1995. It could be expected that the 
amount of increased revenue in 1996 would be 7.7 trillion yen; 
in 1997, 8.1 trillion yen; in 1998, 8.7 trillion yen; in 1999, 
9.3 trillion yen; in 2000, 9.9 trillion yen; therefore, the 
increased revenue from consumption tax would exceed the amount 
of reduction in income tax, and in 1999 the national finance 
would achieve a sound condition. 
  When one compares scenario B and scenario D, even though 
they 
both have the same 7.5 trillion yen decrease in income tax, one 
sees that scenario D's combination tax reduction of 5 trillion 
yen in individual income tax and 2.5 trillion yen in corporate 
income tax is preferable. 
  The Optimum Combination Zone for Policy 
  Numerous scenarios besides A, B, C, and D described above 
have been tried, and as a consequence it has been found that 
there exists an optimum zone among increases of the income tax 
reduction amount and the consumption tax rate. For instance, in 
scenario C if the consumption tax rate is increased from 7 
percent to 8 or 10 percent, the economic growth rate drops, 
rendering useless the effects of an economic countermeasure 
consisting of a 10 trillion yen in income tax cuts. As an 
economic countermeasure, it is most effective to make income tax 
cuts as large as possible while keeping the consumption tax rate 
low. However, for instance, in scenario A the consumption tax 
rate is lowered from 5 percent to 4 percent, which would give 
rise to a situation of collecting insufficient revenue. 
  Future simulations will be predicated on the current 
consumption tax exemption mechanism and structure remaining 
unchanged, so if this premise changes, the relationship between 
income tax cuts and consumption tax rate increases will also 
change. In particular, if they were to be based on the abolition 
of the limited exemption system that excludes a set amount of 
tax for businesses whose taxable sales amount to less than 50 
million yen, the contraction of the applicable range for a 
simplified taxation system, the abolition of tax exemption 
measures for businesses whose taxable sales are 30 million yen 
or less, among others, it could be expected that the same 
consumption tax rate increase would yield further tax revenue. 
  In this simulation of economic countermeasures we tried to 
keep the problem simple. We did not simulate taxation measures 
to control the global environment, tax cut measures for research 
and development (R&amp;D) in science and technology, or domestic 
expansion measures via futuristic urban planning. Some of these 
would include expansion of park space, improvement of high-speed 
traffic and information and communication networks, construction 
of super high-rise residential buildings to let people be closer 
to their workplace due to easing of land and building 
restrictions in the metropolitan centers, etc., as development 
strategies for Japan's economy from a long-term range into the 
21st century. Rather, I wanted to focus on pointing out the 
importance of the problem.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Cold Wind Blows Through Split </F>
Between Hosokawa and Takemura"] 
  [Text] For a while, from the evening of 2 February to the 
following day, there was harsh discord between Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura 
over the prime minister's concept of the public welfare tax. 
What lay behind this, apparently, was also Takemura's 
discontent with the prime minister's growing tendency to lean on 
Ichiro Ozawa, general secretary of Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party]. It is possible that the "triangular" relationship of 
Hosokawa, Ozawa, and Takemura which has been the main frame of 
the government since its inception will now change drastically 
and that a new element of instability will face the government. 
  In a news conference on the morning of 3 February, Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Takemura criticized the prime minister's 
concept of the public welfare tax, saying, "To look back, it 
cannot be said that everything was appropriate." This is the 
first time that Takemura, who is functioning as Prime Minister 
Hosokawa's housekeeper, has criticized the prime minister openly. 
  As far as the matter of reducing the income tax and raising 
the consumption tax is concerned, Takemura has believed since 
late last year that it would be difficult to accept the Finance 
Ministry's idea of "taking care of the two matters in one 
package" in view of the internal circumstances of not only the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] but also Komeito [Clean 
Government Party] and the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP]. He 
is said to have talked with the prime minister about it many 
times and to have been assured that the two matters will be 
"severed" from each other. 
  He thought that this common understanding was the given 
premise when he entrusted the prime minister with making a final 
decision. But the prime minister's final "decision" was "to 
handle the two in a package," and this came as a shock to 
Takemura. Takemura appears to suspect that "the prime minister 
accepted the proposal of Ozawa and Komeito General Secretary 
Ichikawa, who are sympathetic to the Finance Ministry and its 
idea of raising the consumption tax." 
  Explaining the "decision," the prime minister said that 
cabinet members of the SDPJ in a meeting at the prime minister's 
residence on 3 February agreed to honor a decision of the ruling 
party representatives meeting. 
  But Takeyama, in a top leaders meeting of the government and 
ruling parties held at the prime minister's residence late in 
the evening of 2 February, in fact spoke against the concept, 
saying, "I will speak as president of Shinto Sakigake [New Party 
Harbinger], and I would like you to be cautious (about handling 
the two in one package)." Moreover, he refused to attend the 
prime minister's news conference before the dawn of 3 February, 
and he said at his own news conference held later that morning 
that "the mistake should be redressed." All of these acts are 
thought to be his expression of his repulsion toward the stand 
of the prime minister. 
  Recently, Hosokawa has been said to be thinking negatively 
even about a possible merger of the Japan New Party and Shinto 
Sakigake. As a result, Takemura is trying to strengthen his 
relations with SDPJ leaders and people such as DSP Chairman 
Ouchi. 
  Differences in views between Hosokawa and Takemura were 
revealed even on the question of who should be charged with 
examining a revision of the concept of the public welfare tax. 
The prime minister wanted the party representatives [general 
secretaries] conference to be put in charge, but Takemura 
insisted that the party heads council should take care of it. 
  On the evening of 3 February, Takemura announced that he 
would support the prime minister as best as possible, and he 
expressed his willingness to restore good relations with 
Hosokawa, but there is no question that a cold wind has started 
to blow on the relationship between Hosokawa and Takemura, thus 
putting an end to their honeymoon period.

  [Text] Reactions against and criticism of the "Ichi-Ichi 
duo" -- Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] General Secretary Ichiro 
Ozawa and Komeito [Clean Government Party] General Secretary 
Yuichi Ichikawa -- quickly poured out of the ruling coalition 
parties on 3 February. The duo is known to have collaborated 
with the Finance Ministry in pushing for the raising of the 
[current consumption] tax. After the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan [SDPJ] announced its objection to the tax increase, saying 
it is even willing to quit the coalition government, voices 
urging a "holding off" [on the tax increase] were raised by the 
Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], the Sakigake [Harbinger]-Japan 
New Party [JNP] alliance, which is the prime minister's own 
camp; and even the ruling party's two powerhouses -- Shinseito 
and Komeito. 
  They complained that "the issue of raising taxes, about 
which 
the voters are most sensitive, has been handled too 
thoughtlessly," but their complaint may be said to be an 
eruption of discontent about Ozawa and Ichikawa's practice of 
holding "consultations behind closed doors." It is probable 
that this sentiment will have a delicate impact on future 
discussions concerning the reorganization of the [Japanese] 
political world. 
  On that day, the SDPJ was high-spiritedly ready to "fight it 
out," with one senior party official declaring, "Ozawa and 
Ichikawa are making light of the people." One Diet member of 
the party spat out: "We have been made a fool of so often in the 
past. This time we will fight back tooth and nail." The SDPJ 
has had to make concessions to keep the coalition in power -- 
first on the question of the partial opening of the rice market 
and then on political reform issues. It can be said that their 
resentment, which has accumulated, is erupting altogether. Even 
a right-wing member of the party said emphatically: "Maybe they 
forced it on us, thinking that we will leave the coalition. If 
so, we can get together with Sakigake and the DSP." 
  At an informal meeting of the two houses' members of the 
Sakigake-JNP alliance, [Sakigake] General Secretary Hiroyuki 
Sonoda had a difficult time explaining what had happened and 
claimed, "It was impossible for me alone to present an objection 
at the meeting of the representatives." But those present at 
the meeting complained bitterly, saying: "The masters of the 
government we formed are supposed to be the people. How will 
you explain this to the people?" or "Do you want to cheat the 
people in order to shake hands with the Liberal Democratic 
Party?" 
  Within the DSP, General Secretary Takashi Yonezawa, who had 
earlier agreed together with people like Ozawa at the ruling 
party representatives' meeting to the proposal on raising the 
tax, has reversed his position completely and asked the prime 
minister by telephone to reconsider the matter, after party 
Chairman Keigo Ouchi (health and welfare minister) and Akira 
Yamagishi, chairman of the Japanese Trade Union Confederation, 
voiced their complaints about the increase. 
  In Komeito, which normally is proud of its unity, there were 
voices of complaint heard in a general meeting held on 2 
February. One said, "The party had said it would agree with the 
views of Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura in going ahead with 
tax cuts without tying this to increasing the tax. Why was the 
tax increase included in the bill?" Another said, "Is it all 
right not to hold formal discussions on the problem of the 
unfair tax system?" With General Secretary Ichikawa being 
absent from the event so that he could participate in a party 
representatives' meeting, Komeito members' criticisms and doubts 
were conspicuous. Party Diet members whispered to each other, 
"This is a reckless run by the Ichi-Ichi duo while riding on the 
back of the Finance Ministry's horse." 
  Even in Shinseito, which entrusted Ozawa with decisionmaking 
on the previous day, voices saying "We should uphold the 
coalition by presenting some kind of concession to the SDPJ" 
were heard one after another at the party staff meeting around 
noon. Now that there are emerging moves even within these two 
parties -- Shinseito and Komeito -- to reconsider the concept of 
handling the tax cuts and the tax increase in a package, it has 
become very clear that objections to the bill within the ruling 
camp are quite strong.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 7 February Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] The outline of the Ministry of Finance [MOF] draft 
budget for fiscal year 1994 has been set, except for the 
unresolved dispute on the income tax cut and the national 
welfare tax. 
  The rate of increase for general operating expenditures will 
be 2.4 percent, compared to the original budget for fiscal 1993, 
representing the lowest growth rate in six years. However, all 
requests for allocations for public work projects were approved, 
showing consideration for the sluggish economy. 
  In terms of taxation, the expansion of preferential 
treatment 
for land replacement, and the strengthening of taxation on 
corporate unaccounted expenditures and entertainment expenses 
have been decided upon. However, coordination within the 
government and among the ruling coalition parties on the income 
tax cut and the accompanying tax hike has been delayed until 7 
February, and if a conclusion is not reached, this may seriously 
affect the schedule for the unofficial announcement of the MOF 
draft budget (originally set for 10 February).

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] It has been revealed that the Air Self Defense 
Force [ASDF] has been compiling a draft research report on 
operation plans regarding the action of its units in the event 
of emergency situations. A number of ASDF officials have 
provided verbal evidence. Among a number of points, the report 
suggests that an "exclusive zone" be designated in the airspace 
directly above international waters and adjacent to sovereign 
airspace, and in the event an unidentified aircraft enters this 
zone, the ASDF should be permitted to take the same course of 
action against such aircraft as when a violation of territorial 
airspace occurs -- such as firing warning shots -- even if the 
prime minister or the director general of the Defense Agency 
[DA] has not yet given orders to take defensive actions. Not 
only have such details been left unreported to the DA director 
general and to the intra-agency bureaus, but they go as far as 
to imply revision of the current SDF law. Consequently, this is 
expected to arouse much controversy. 
  The draft report which has been worked out in secrecy by the 
ASDF is entitled, "Operational Regulations, Part 2." ASDF 
uniformed officials independently compiled the draft report on 
such points as inadequacies under the current SDF law regarding 
unit operations and civil support in emergency situations when a 
direct military threat is imminent to Japan and the surrounding 
areas. 
  The draft report expressly states in its generalizations 
that 
"this is on the precondition that revisions would be made to the 
SDF law." It then lists, according to the type of operation, 
the particulars in detail. Current legislation only authorizes 
action against violation of the 12-mile territorial airspace. 
In the particulars, the draft report includes a suggestion that 
in order to have enough time to prepare against surprise 
attacks, a certain area outside the sovereign airspace should be 
designated as an "exclusive zone" and treated in the same manner 
as if it were within sovereign airspace. The size of the "zone" 
itself has not been indicated. 
  In addition, the draft report touches on the issue of 
building facilities for holding enemy soldiers in custody should 
they be captured inside the country and on the issue of 
procedures regarding the utilization of commercial airports and 
recruitment of commercial ships and other means of transport 
during emergency situations. 
  Copies of the draft report are in safe-keeping at ASDF 
regional headquarters, as well as at the Air Defense Command 
Headquarters (Fuchu, Tokyo). They are being treated as "defense 
secrets." 
  The DA has traditionally formulated an annual defense 
buildup 
program (nenbo) for each fiscal year on the presumption of a 
military assault from the outside. Regarding basic matters 
which can be handled within the limitations of current 
legislation, the ASDF has worked out, within its defense buildup 
programs, concrete measures in the form of "operational 
regulations," which are equivalent to operation plans, and these 
have been channeled to the ASDF's various units. For example, 
they include key points regarding the process of advancing 
fighter units all over the nation to air bases which are located 
close to the site of conflicts and ways to reinforce aircraft 
scrambling readiness. 
  In the backdrop of work being done on compiling the draft 
report are concerns among uniformed defense officials who point 
out that under current legislation the use of weapons is 
prohibited before an order is issued to take defensive action, 
even if it has been determined that an emergency situation 
exists, except in cases which necessitate action for self 
defense or emergency evacuation. Deep- rooted concerns have 
been particularly voiced in the ASDF pointing out there are many 
problems. For example, under current legislation, ASDF pilots 
cannot retaliate against enemy aircraft before an order has been 
issued to take defensive action unless a friendly aircraft has 
been shot down; procedures regarding action in response to 
surprise air attacks need to be worked out. 
  A senior Air Staff official stated: "I can make absolutely 
no 
comments about details regarding operational regulations since 
the SDF Law designates them as confidential matters." 
  Opinion is said to be divided even in light of international 
laws regarding the propriety of designating "exclusive zones" in 
the airspace over international waters according to the level of 
tension during a crisis. These exclusive zones are said to be 
similar to "security zones" which various nations have declared 
for such purposes as missile firing ranges and the air zones 
that the British military has set up during such instances as 
the Falkland War. However, the draft report does not give legal 
grounds for its proposed designation of exclusive zones.

<F P=106> [Article by Kenichi Imai, director, Japan Study Center, </F>
Stanford University: "Build Livelihood System Industry Centered 
on Information and Environment"] 
  [Text] If assessed according to Schumpeter's theory, 
Japanese industrial capability is not in a particularly 
despairing state. Then, how can the Japanese manufacturing 
industry, which strayed into a "black forest," find its way out? 
<H5>  Technological Innovations Reach Interim Stage </H5>
  It is apparent that the Japanese manufacturing industry will 
be on the verge of a crisis if the current downtrend continues. 
However, discussions that needlessly incite crises are not 
helpful. It is essential, especially at this time, to reexamine 
the "map" of our macro and micro measures, find the way out of 
the black forest into which Japanese industries blundered and 
identify the direction leading to a reliable course. 
  When Schumpeter analyzed the Great Depression of the 1930's, 
he studied the capabilities of the then main industries, such as 
automobiles, steel, chemicals, etc., and concluded that these 
industries were not in a particularly deplorable state and, to 
explain why such a serious depression resulted despite that, he 
turned his attention to the overall stage setting of industrial 
operations. Though today's Japanese industries have their 
respective problems, they are not as dilapidated as the U.S. 
industries were over 10 years ago and they have not lost 
competitive power like the current high-tech industries of 
Europe. 
  However, it is certain that they are lost in the forest and, 
to escape, they must examine what kind of forest it is and where 
they are situated topographically. 
  To do that, first, the so-called map of long-range changes 
in 
technological innovations, which are the bases of industrial 
developments, will be reviewed and the terrain of our present 
position will be described. The cyclical theory that long-term 
variations in technological innovations are simply repetitious 
occurrences is difficult to accept per se, but the conclusion of 
our evaluations of corroborative researches made from various 
viewpoints is that the possibility is extremely strong that 
technological innovations will face a turning point around 1995. 
In other words, as widely reported, the present is an interim 
stage of technological innovations, when the wave of old 
technologies has peaked and the wave of new technologies has not 
arrived yet. This viewpoint that it is an interim stage is a 
factor adding to confusion in the industrial sector. 
<H5>  Reengineering </H5>
  To explain our points briefly, the simple sketch shown in 
Figure 1 [not reproduced] was drawn. 
  This sketch was drawn with the present Japanese situation in 
mind--when a single technological innovation appears and reaches 
the matured stage, the technological system becomes complicated 
and multiple interactions are required for the innovation, and 
when the cumulative interactions exceed the critical point, 
discontinuous changes begin to appear. We call this type of jump 
"systemic innovation." As for concrete examples, the "new 
synthetic textile," discussed later is a good sample. 
  However, simultaneously, the next wave of technological 
innovations begins to overlap and the theoretical development of 
a new paradigm is already apparent. To put it concretely, the 
first wave dealt with electronics-related technological 
innovations and the next wave deals with molecular biology and 
nuclear engineering. The crucial point is that there are 
interactions between the performances of the former system and 
the theoretical deployment of the latter system. For example, in 
the case of the "new synthetic textile," progress is already 
being made toward another new fabric through the influence of 
molecular biology. 
  An equally important point is that the two waves are 
overlapping the transitional stage toward an 
information/communication-based infrastructure in the economic 
world. 
  With these waves overlapping, the viewpoint that Japanese 
industries are at an interim stage of technological innovations 
is valid one. The assessment of the interim stage will influence 
decisions and it is important to acknowledge that this is the 
border of twofold opportunities in the sense mentioned earlier. 
To say that opportunities are twofold might sound optimistic but 
the significance lies in the following two points: 
  1. The simple wait-and-see attitude or interim viewpoint 
that 
technological innovations are exhausted, so to speak, and the 
next wave must be awaited is not interpreting the present 
situation correctly and will not lead the way out of the present 
labyrinth. Even if the application of superconductivity, 
biotechnology, nuclear engineering, etc. must be awaited for 
full-scale technological innovations, the foundation of their 
development will be the present electronics technology. That 
such a future can be clearly foreseen is providing enterprises 
the perseverance to continue current technological developments. 
  2. Changes and innovations are the focal points of current 
problems, but it is not possible to start afresh and redesign. 
In assessing the problem, it is important to be prepared for 
full-scale systemic reforms but, as long as the economic system 
and organization are severely restricted by technologies, the 
correct interpretation of the technological and economic 
paradigm of present-day Japan is the best and basic course for 
systemic reforms and organizational changes. 
  At present, the concept of corporate "reengineering" is in 
vogue in the United States and is attracting attention in Japan 
too, but the point that is stressed, "return to the starting 
point and redesign business operations," should not be 
misunderstood. 
  To return to the starting point does not mean to start 
afresh 
with a clean slate. It means to determine again, on a map, the 
course that was pursued intently up until now, clearly identify 
one's position, and plot a new course for business operations. 
As evident from the foregoing discussion, Japanese reengineering 
is actually only superposing and it should be undertaken as a 
"process" linked to market changes. There is a difference 
between that process and the method of readjusting while 
maintaining the status quo, and clarification of that subtle 
difference is the important point for consideration at this time. 
<H5>  Future Production of Goods </H5>
  Let us proceed now to concrete discussions. First, with 
reference to the aforementioned return to the "starting point," 
where should that point be placed? In the case of Japan, that is 
the "production of goods" which closely followed technological 
innovations. Despite the software age and the substantial 
advancement of service industries, that point remains the same. 
The starting point, which enabled Japanese industry to develop 
to this stage, was the universally unprecedented elimination of 
segregation between blue- and white-collar workers and the 
concentration of knowledge, know-how, skills, and intellect on 
production of goods. 
  However, the direction to go from this starting point is not 
sheer production of goods. It should be information-based 
production, production processes with high information and 
intelligence content, and not just single-item production, but 
systematized production. Needless to say, Japanese production 
will not be profitable unless it develops to that stage if the 
present yen appreciation continues. 
  To state it so there would be no misunderstanding, in an age 
when software and designing have become vital, it does not mean 
that Japanese industry can be rebuilt by ignoring them. It does 
mean that if reconstruction is considered with the past 
development route, and with the technologies and financial 
resources accumulated during that process as the starting point, 
to put it succinctly, the direction toward "information- and 
knowledge-intensive production" will be found. The concrete task 
of Japanese-style reengineering is to consider the 
organizational aspects of how to combine software designing with 
manufacturing capability and how to raise the software ratio 
while increasing the interactions between them. 
  Japanese industries will be divided into three main 
categories and the basic points of each will be discussed below. 
  Classified from an overall standpoint, Japanese industries 
can be divided into three groups--"intellectual industry," 
"industrial resources industry," and "consumer system 
industry"--and with respect to each, industrial characteristics 
vary and the method and organization for rebuilding also differ. 
<H5>  Intellectual Industry </H5>
  In this industry where companies are striving for leadership 
in the global competition, the considerable lead taken by the 
United States is one of the main causes of anxiety about the 
future of Japanese enterprises. In the architectural competetion 
to organize and integrate basic software and microprocessor 
units, U.S. corporations, such as Intel and Microsoft, are the 
dominant leaders and Japanese companies are not even in the race 
at the moment. That is why the outlook does not look as bright 
as it did during the period after the past oil crises when Japan 
restructured its industries by taking the initiative to 
introduce electronics technology. 
  It is true that architectural standardization of equipment 
related and geared to computers is important and future 
competition will greatly affect the profits of enterprises 
involved, but that is not the sole purpose of the competition. 
The ultimate objective is to provide a combination of hardware, 
software, and services that will satisfy corporate and 
individual users. 
  In the software competition, too, basic software (operating 
system) is certainly important, but not exclusively. Recently, 
Japanese computer manufacturers are trying to adopt the strategy 
of "solution business," intended to present to users solutions 
to problems of the overall system, and though it might be an 
option they had to select because they were lagging in the 
architectural race, it can be said to be viable as a strategic 
goal. Unless concrete images of information-based organizational 
innovations can be visualized beyond the architectural race, the 
demand for computers will not be revived by this competition. 
  This argument is especially valid from our standpoint that 
the present time is the turning point for the basic 
infrastructure. Infrastructural conversion is not accomplished 
by a sudden switch to an entirely new order but is advanced by 
taking actions to complement the existing infrastructure and in 
the case of building a new information and communication 
infrastructure, too, truly diverse tasks covering the entire 
spectrum of hardware, software, and services are essential. To 
accomplish that, it is important to learn what needs exist in 
society as well as what information-processing and work 
capability the end users in the respective work sites should 
possess so there are many economic opportunities in the 
"solution business," which points out options. 
  In the semiconductor industry, Japan is ahead in DRAM 
[dynamic, random-access memory] development, but lags in MPU 
[microprocessor unit] logic. Both are needed, of course, in 
personal computers and work stations and, when integrated into a 
system, electric power consumption must be kept to a minimum. 
Therefore, even if the United States is leading in MPU's, there 
is the third alernative of low power consumption where Japan can 
display its strength. This third course is not very profitable, 
but reduction of computer power consumption, which is already 
becoming a big problem, is compatible with the basic move toward 
an information-oriented, earth-conscious environment. 
  Particularly in the case of Japan, because the information 
technology is notably lagging in the public sector for various 
reasons, fortunately or unfortunately, tasks to be performed 
have piled up and the current recession presents an excellent 
opportunity to tackle them governmentally. The problem is that 
what is essential is not hardware but software, so the urgent 
policy measure in the allocation of public investments is to 
increase the software ratio. 
  In essence, the problem is not the lack of financial 
resources, but their distribution, and the task can be 
accomplished if the present regime changes the financial 
allocations as they have promised publicly. Working toward the 
policy goal of creating an age of "everywhere computing," when 
computers can be used by anyone, anywhere and anytime, and 
computers become a natural part of daily living, will provide 
the Japanese intellectual industry with a clear direction to 
follow. 
<H5>  Industrial Resources Industry </H5>
  By the industrial resources industry, we refer to the 
overall 
industry concerned with intermediate resources, such as 
machinery parts, machine tools, robots, etc., that support the 
manufacturing industry. These industries are fully capable of 
carrying out our "systemic innovations," by thoroughly 
dismantling the product manufacturing processes and upgrading 
each, and then, reintegrating them. 
  Also, these products are indispensable to the industrial 
sophistication of Asian nations and the construction of new 
plants by the former socialist countries and on a near-term 
basis, a strong effective demand is awaiting in countries which 
can be supplied through industrial channels and cooperative 
network. 
  Despite that, these industries are suffering from the 
recession simply because of the cyclical effect resulting from 
the lack of effective demand within Japan. Particularly in the 
case of the machine tool industry, which depends heavily on the 
level of plant and equipment investment, the decline in private 
equipment outlay is exerting a serious effect. In the United 
States, during the recession of 1980's, machine tool capacity 
was curtailed because that problem could not be overcome and 
that caused the deterioration of the U.S. manufacturing 
industry. If the starting point of Japan's international 
competitive power is thought to be "production" capability, in 
the aforementioned sense, effective demand must be created 
through macro measures to prevent the cutback of that 
capability, and repetition of the U.S. mistake must be avoided. 
There is no reason why effective demand measures of that 
moderate extent cannot be enacted. 
  Another facet that must be dealt with policy-wise is how to 
maintain the vital segment of the small enterprise network which 
supports the base of the machinery industry. The small factories 
in the downtown districts of Tokyo and Osaka are not simple 
groupings of small enterprises. As I have said before, this 
small enterprise network constitutes a delicate and important 
base of Japan's manufacturing capability through its capacity 
for speedy trial manufacturing and production of special order 
parts requiring unique skills, and its flexible operational 
setup for specialization and cooperation. It is a technical 
grouping that is rare in the world. 
  The loss of this capability would be a fatal blow to 
Japanese 
production capacity. However, at present, this group is clearly 
facing a crisis. But at the same time, surprisingly handsome 
factories, which do not even look like factories, have begun to 
appear recently. Therefore, especially during this business 
slump, the new factory law, etc., should be aggressively pushed 
and governmental efforts should be made to revive and maintain 
this important segment of the technical group as part of the 
urban development endeavor. By advancing deregulation, the urban 
plans which were set back at the final stage can be revived and 
domestic demand can certainly be created. 
<H5>  Consumer System Industry </H5>
  By the conumer system industry, we refer to the group of 
industries that have a direct bearing on our lives, i.e., food, 
clothing, and shelter. The policy task facing Japan at present 
is how to systematize them and make them efficient and 
convenient to use, and in so doing, simultaneously expand 
domestic demand while eliminating foreign and internal price 
differentials. As concrete measures, here too, policies which 
deal with information services and earth environment must be 
promoted aggressively. 
  First, the outlook for "clothing" is rather bright. The 
reason is that the technological innovation of producing new 
synthetic textiles, which might be called a typical example of 
"systemic innovation," has already appeared and is expanding the 
market. As for the new synthetic fabric, "the high sensitivity, 
which natural textiles do not possess, was attained by applying 
a combination of delicate spinning and skillful processing 
techniques to existing textiles." Universally speaking, its 
creation through the concerted action of a medium-sized Japanese 
textile manufacturer and a small textile processing enterprise 
in the Hokuriku District makes it an event to record. Even at 
this interim stage of technological innovations, an innovation 
of this type is possible by devising a new system and as a 
result, an old industry, called the textile industry, has been 
revived. 
  This type of innovation produces a ripple effect of a 
desirable pattern. In fact, with Toray Industries, which 
represents the new synthetic textile industry, as the leader and 
with the support of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, numerous 
companies are cooperating to establish a so-called "fashion 
town" on the shores of Tokyo Bay. Information technologies are 
being used widely there and a worldwide exchange center in this 
field is being created. It is said that if fashion is included, 
the new synthetic textiles have reached a market scale 
surpassing automobiles. 
  Needed now are systemic technological innovations that 
create 
demand, and policies to support them, including establishment of 
"centers" for worldwide mutual exchanges. 
  Even in the field of "food," similar systematic innovations 
are about to take place. Innovations in the distribution sector 
are actually beginning to occur and the Japanese industrial 
system has begun to change in the field closest to our daily 
lives. The use of information technology by 7-11 stores has 
become too well-known and everyone takes it for granted, but the 
results are impressive. The important factors are that such 
advanced information know-how has spread to other distribution 
enterprises and other forms of businesses, and that such 
technologies and know-how can also be applied to recycling of 
commercial products and waste materials. 
  The removal of regulations will probably further promote 
such 
activities. Speed in the spread and transfer of technologies and 
continued upgrading during that phase have been the superior 
aspects of the Japanese industrial system, but that mechanism 
has been obstructed by protective regulations in the 
distribution field. This is an excellent field in which to apply 
the fundamentals of information technology--openness and 
downsizing--and by their application in many industries that lag 
in efficiency and by their spread throughout the country, the 
consumer system industry can develop substantially toward an 
information-based, earth environment-conscious system. 
  As for "shelter," the activities of Tostem Co., which is 
systematizing housing construction through use of certain 
building materials, and Secom Co., which is introducing 
technology in daily livelihood mainly through residential 
security services, can be called information-based creative 
innovations aimed at developing a full-fledged consumer system 
industry. Even among research institutes under the jurisdiction 
of the Construction Ministry, there are estimates that housing 
construction costs are nearly 20 percent higher than in Europe 
and the United States, and some builders claim costs are 50 
percent higher. Together with the promotion of construction 
materials import, it should be possible to lower costs by about 
20 percent. Fortunately, land prices have already fallen nearly 
20 percent so Japanese housing costs should drop considerably 
and demand can be expected to increase. 
  This type of price decline, or elimination of foreign and 
domestic price differences, tends to be regarded as having a 
deflationary effect which will worsen the recession but, 
according to estimates of the "International Price Structure 
Research Institute," of which I am the director, if Japanese 
prices fall to the U.S. level through elimination of 
foreign-domestic price differences, real consumer expenditures 
will increase by 20 percent per capita through the price 
elasticity effect of demand. If the planning begins for the 
information-based infrastructure, which we propose, the 
livelihood system industries affecting "shelter" will begin to 
operate in earnest and will probably change our living pattern. 
If that cannot be accomplished, Japan will not be able to stave 
off international criticism. 
<H5>  Start "Reflective" Actions </H5>
  Based on this analysis, Japanese industries have not lost 
the 
capability to rebuild nor are they incapable of determining the 
future course. To take Schumpeter's example referenced at the 
beginning, the results of our industrial capacity analysis, 
undertaken to clarify the causes of recession, should not at all 
lead us to despair. 
  If that is so, the blame for the causes of recession would 
tend to be placed on the failure of government policies, but 
such recriminations are not productive. It is important to 
analyze and understand the real reasons for the failure and not 
only the government but companies and consumers, too, as well as 
the market, had failed in greater or lesser degrees. 
  As stated at the beginning, the essential attitude is to 
reexamine the map in the black forest into which one strayed, 
confirm the present location of each, and start "reflective" 
actions. Reflective in this sense does not carry a moral 
significance and means reflective actions, as used in 
self-organizational evaluations, to create new activities to 
cope with new information. 
  If the foregoing arguments are analyzed and a reliable 
course 
is plotted from the general map of Japanese industries, that 
would point to the aggressive development of a consumer system 
industry centered on information and earth environment. It is 
essential for companies and consumers, as well as the 
government, to react in response to the determined course and 
the self-organized combined and cumulative efforts will create 
the strength to override this severe recession. 
  The organizational principle of the New Deal, which 
triggered 
the recovery from the Great Depression of the 1930's, was to 
"involve" various organizations in its operations. That was made 
possible by the attraction of the New Deal "banner" and the 
grassroots movements of the people who responded. In the present 
context, that would be self-organizational actions directed 
toward information utilization and earth environment 
preservation. 
  Open standards and downsizing are affecting the computer 
industry significantly at present, but they are not limited to 
the computer sector. Openness means that information will be 
displayed publicly, and downsizing is, literally, reducing to a 
smaller scale. This is the age of an open world where 
information is publicly disclosed and small-scale equipment and 
activities link into a network to perform big jobs. If systemic 
reforms and organizational changes are tackled after an earnest 
study of the true nature of information technologies, the result 
will not be decontrol and clever organizational reform just for 
appearance sake. 
  What we need now are mutual interactions between economics 
and politics to change the system and organization themselves 
reactively as a "process" to such market movements, and our 
determination to seek continuation of that action.

<F P=106> [Report by Murray Hiebert from Hanoi] </F>
  [Text] As Vietnam prises open its economy to market 
forces, the cachet of foreign goods is on the rise. But 
conspicuous consumpton is only one of the problems on which 
Hanoi's bureaucrats now need to keep an eye. They are quickly 
learning that the industrialised world has more to unload than 
champagne, computers and cars; it also has garbage. 
  Vietnam's customs officers are the last line of defence in a 
country belatedly acknowledging the need to sort the rich 
world's waste from its other goods on offer. So when Tra Vinh 
Cereal and Foodstuff Co. asked the Customs Department to 
inspect.its 61- container shipment of "assorted, mixed plastic," 
customs officers became curious when the shipment failed to show 
up. Eventually, the missing containers were located in early 
January at the Anh Sang Private Enterprise in the suburbs of Ho 
Chi Minh City. What they found was shocking even to the 
department's seasoned veterans: the "assorted, mixed plastic" 
turned out to be 1,114 tonnes of filthy, used plastic bags. 
  Fearing that Anh Sang would either try to recycle the bags-- 
causing serious air and water pollution--or bury them in a 
landfill, Ho Chi Minh City's environment committee promptly 
ordered the bags to be re-exported to their original owner. (The 
environment committee said that the containers originated in 
Germany but wouldn't identify the names of any foreign companies 
involved with the shipment.) Vietnamese officials say this 
incident marks the first known case of foreign waste materials 
arriving in the country. But the desire to do so is not new: 
government officials say many foreign companies have sought 
permission to dump their waste in Vietnam since Hanoi launched 
its free-market reforms seven years ago. 
  "Foreign companies try to exploit the poor knowledge of 
local 
officials by telling them these imports won't hurt Vietnam," 
says Nguyen Ngoc Sinh, acting director of Vietnam's National 
Environmental Agency. "They try to prove we will earn much money 
and be able to resolve our unemployment problem." These 
arguments appear to have won at least some converts. During the 
debate on an environmental protection law, passed by the 
National Assembly in late December, some delegates argued that 
Vietnam should consider accepting some solid-waste imports. In 
the end, their proposal was defeated. 
  The new environment law, Vietnam's first, seeks to prevent 
further degradation of the environment as the country rushes to 
develop in the wake of the communist party's retreat from 
command economics. But the law marks only the first halting 
step to protect an environment already battered by years of war, 
overcrowding and underdevelopment. 
  The law aims to provide a general framework for 
environmental 
protection. The task of developing concrete regulations on 
environmental problems such as industrial discharge, toxic gas, 
air standards and water quality has been assigned to the 
premier's office and to the National Environmental Agency, which 
falls under the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment. 
Hanoi already has adopted laws or promulgated decrees on the 
protection of forests, land and mineral resources. 
  Sinh hopes his office will have some preliminary guidelines 
in place within two months. One of the first new requirements 
established under the law is for factories to complete 
environmental impact assessment studies. Factories that don't 
take measures to meet minimum environmental requirements within 
a certain time will be ordered to stop operating. Licence won't 
be granted to new factories unles they meet these standards, 
Sinh says. 
  Although Vietnam's urban environ ment is still in better 
condition than those in most neighbouring countries, pollution 
is increasing rapidly in both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. 
Virtually no industries in either city, including those 
financed through foreign investment, treat any of their waste. 
An estimated 250 factories in Hanoi discharge untreated waste, 
including chemicals, dyes and some heavy metals, directly into 
the city's canals, river and lakes. Hanoi has no plant to treat 
waste water and its ageing waste-water network, built by the 
former French colonial rulers more than 50 years ago, serves 
only the old part of the city. This creates serious 
environmental risk, especially during the rainy season, when the 
streets are often flooded with a mixture of domestic waste 
water, industrial effluent and storm water. 
  In addition, Hanoi's factories pollute the air through the 
emission of coal particles sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide. 
The heavily industrialised Thuong Dinh area in the southern 
suburbs suffers sulphur dioxide and carbor monoxide levels two 
to five times higher than permitted levels, according to an envi 
ronmental atlas completed in December by the city's Commission 
for Science, Technology and Environment and the Hanoi University 
of Civil Engineering. But as bad as the urban environment has 
become, Vietnam's densely populated rural areas are under even 
create environmental stress. Over the past five decades, the 
country's forest cover has declined from 44% of total land area 
to less than 24%, due to war, expansion of farmland, growing 
fuel needs and commercial logging. This massive deforestation 
has lead to large- scale soil erosion and increasing floods and 
drought. 
  Gibbons, leaf monkeys, slow lorises and other animals 
listed as "extremely threatened" by the Convention on the 
International Trade in Endangered Species are for sale in 
Vietnam's markets and smuggled to China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. 
Hunters have wiped out some 200 species of birds over the past 
four decades. And in the coastal province of Khanh Hoa alone, 
an estimated 50 tonnes of coral reef, the habitat for a wide 
variety of marine life, are being destroyed each year to produce 
limestone for cement. 
  Although Vietnamese and foreign environmentalists laud the 
new environmental protection law, they point out that it won't 
change much unless Vietnam establishes a mechanism to enforce 
the regulations. Sinh says his department has only 40 experts-- 
"one- tenth of what I need"--and another 250 officials in 
provincial offices to monitor the country's environment. He 
expects a budget of only Dong 60 billion (US$5.5 million) this 
year. 
  Some observers wonder how effective environmental monitors 
will be unless their salaries are increased. "The people who 
destroy the forests now are the foresters," notes a foreign 
environmentalist. "If they're only paid US$15 a month, they have 
to find their own means of making a livelihood," he says, 
alluding to growing corruption among state employees. 
  A recent World Bank report argues that environmental 
protection in Vietnam also will require clear lines of authority 
and the elimination of unnecessary duplication of 
responsibility. For example, nine different national agencies 
currently play a role in establishing rules for the use of water. 
  Vietnam, like most of its neighbours, faces a dilemma: how 
to balance economic development with the cost of environmental 
protection. But unlike many other countries in Asia, Vietnam 
doesn't have the "luxury" of developing first and worrying about 
its environment later. 
  Vietnam has "very little environmental capital, such as 
forests, left to waste," observes a foreign economist. "Thailand 
could destroy its forests as its economy grew, but Vietnam's 
forests are already depleted. Further neglect is not really an 
option." 
  Vietnamese economists and environmentalists say the real 
underlying problem is that there is a limit to what they can do 
until the country achieves a higher level of economic 
development. 
  "I often talk to farmers about the value of protecting 
mangroves and wildlife," says Le Dien Duc of Hanoi University's 
Centre for Natural Resources Management and Environmental 
Studies. "They smile at me and say, your talk is very 
interesting, but we're starving. We have nothing to eat'."

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 7 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa will urge U.S. President Bill Clinton in upcoming 
talks to extend U.S. trade privileges for China and support its 
early admission to the GATT world trade body, government sources 
said Monday [7 February]. Hosokawa, slated to meet Clinton in 
Washington on February 11, will point out that improvement in 
Sino-U.S. relations will contribute to Asian stability, the 
sources said. 
  The Foreign Ministry expects Beijing to retaliate should 
Clinton refuse to renew China's most-favored-nation (MFN) 
status, which guarantees Chinese goods low-tariff access to the 
U.S. market, the sources said. Clinton has said he will not 
extend MFN for China when it comes up for renewal in June, 
unless Beijing makes significant efforts to improve the 
country's poor human rights record, such as by releasing 
political prisoners. 
  Washington was also not satisfied with the results of talks 
between U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Chinese 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in Paris last month, which 
revolved around the human rights issue. 
  Earlier this month, the U.S. State Department in its annual 
human rights report said that China, despite having made some 
positive moves in 1993, still falls "far short" of 
internationally recognized standards. Hosokawa will reportedly 
tell Clinton that Tokyo considers it unlikely that Beijing will 
improve human rights in response to U.S. pressure, the sources 
said. 
  Chinese retaliatory measures in the event of the suspension 
of MFN would also affect trade with other countries including 
Japan, the premier will say, according [to] the sources. 
  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, during a recent visit to 
China, assured the Beijing leadership of Japanese support for 
China's GATT application. 
  Hosokawa will also advise Clinton not to upset China in 
order 
to gain its cooperation in peacefully solving the almost 
year-long row over North Korea's alleged nuclear weapons 
program, the sources said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- Japan Airlines Co. (JAL) has 
selected Pratt and Whitney of the United States as its supplier 
of engines for a new generation of medium-size airplanes to be 
introduced in fiscal 1995, company officials said Thursday [3 
February]. 
  The officials said JAL will purchase 44 PW4000 series 
engines, worth a total of 440 million dollars, for Boeing 777s, 
an all-new wide-bodied twin-engine model that seats up to 440 
passengers. 
  JAL had considered General Electric Co. Of the U.S. and 
Rolls- Royce PLC of Britain as possible engine suppliers. 
  With the decision, JAL joined rival airlines all Nippon 
Airways Co. (ANA) and Japan Air System Co. (JAS) in buying Pratt 
and Whitney engines for the same Boeing planes. The three 
airlines plan to cooperate in repair and maintenance work on the 
aircraft.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- The Tokyo High Court 
decided Friday [4 February] not to any longer seek an 
out-of-court compromise in a suit in which local residents are 
demanding government compensation for high noise levels at the 
U.S. Yokota Air Base on the outskirts of Tokyo. 
  Residents living near the U.S. base held talks with the 
government over the court's compromise proposal but the two 
sides failed to reach agreement. 
  Presiding Judge Kiyoshi Uetani said he had decided to give 
up 
seeking a compromise and will deliver the court's judgment on 
the case on March 30. 
  Some 600 residents are demanding the Japanese Government ban 
flights from the base between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m., and pay 
compensation for their suffering both in the past and in the 
future. 
  In March 1989, the Tokyo District Court rejected the demand 
for a ban on the night flights and compensation for future 
annoyance but ordered the government to pay 330 million yen in 
compensation for past victimization. 
  In November 1993, the high court presented a compromise to 
the two sides including a proposal that flights not be permitted 
between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. 
  Although the residents expressed acceptance of the 
compromise, the government put forward an alternative offer made 
up of other reconciliatory conditions. 
  The residents were dissatisfied with the government's new 
offer and called on the government to state clearly that it will 
make an effort to reduce noise levels in future. 
  The two sides held a total of seven rounds of talks at the 
court in order to try and reach a compromise before finally 
breaking off the discussions.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- Russia will continue 
pursuing reforms now that the basis for democratization has been 
established through a new constitution, Aleksandr Yakovlev, 
president of Russia's Center for Studies of Contemporary Japan, 
said Thursday [3 February]. 
  Yakovlev made the remarks in a meeting with Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata, Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  Yakovlev also told Hata that pessimistic views abroad about 
Russia's situation following December 12 parliamentary elections 
are not true, the officials said. 
  Hata told Yakovlev that Japan is closely watching 
developments around Russia's reforms, which he hopes will 
succeed, they said. 
  Yakovlev was here to attend a trilateral meeting of 
academics, government officials and military brass from Japan, 
Russia and the U.S., which ended Wednesday. 
  Earlier in the day, Hata met participants -- Deputy Foreign 
Minister Georgiy Mamedov, Gen. Andrey Nikolayev, head of the 
Russian Federal Border Service and Commander-in-Chief of the 
Border Forces and Col. Gen. Vladimir Zhuberenko, deputy chief of 
Joint Staff of the Armed Forces. 
  Mamedov told Hata that the two-day gathering allowed the two 
nations to confirm common interests on broad international 
problems, the officials said. 
  He was also quoted as saying that President Boris Yeltsin's 
visit to Japan last September and the recent meeting boosted 
close dialogue and deepened bilateral ties. 
  Mamedov welcomed Hata's visit to Russia, and Hata replied he 
wants to visit after studying results of bilateral working-level 
talks on a territorial dispute later this month in Moscow, they 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 7 KYODO -- A territorial dispute 
between Japan and Russia might not be resolved until a new 
generation of politicians comes to power in Russia, a leading 
Russian Japanologist said in Tokyo on Monday [7 February]. 
  Konstantin Sarkisov, director of the Center for Japanese 
Studies at the Institute of Oriental Studies, told KYODO NEWS 
SERVICE that democratization in Russia has made it possible for 
opponents of the former communist regime to air their views. He 
said this has made a solution to the territorial dispute more 
difficult than it might have been when Russia was part of the 
Soviet Union. 
  The disputed islands, known in Japan as the northern 
territories, are Kunashiri, Etorofu, Shikotan and the Habomai 
group of islets. The islands, which lie off the northernmost 
main Japanese island of Hokkaido, were seized from Japan by the 
former Soviet Union at the end of World War II. 
  Sarkisov, 51, an Armenian educated at Leningrad State 
University, said the new Russian Constitution ensures that 
President Boris Yeltsin has the final say over foreign policy 
decisions in Russia. 
  But he said the December election in Russia in which 
conservatives, including ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
scored a big success, had made it more difficult for Yeltsin to 
take a strong stand on a controversial issue like the disputed 
islands. 
  Sarkisov said this could result in the present 
administration 
leaving any decision on the islands "to the next generation of 
politicians." 
  Sarkisov predicted there will be no dramatic change in 
Russo- 
Japanese relations under the current Yeltsin administration. 
  "It is just a matter of keeping up our contacts on a daily 
basis," he said. 
  The territorial dispute remains a stumbling block to 
normalization of relations between the two countries. Tokyo 
maintains it will not conclude a peace treaty with Moscow unless 
the territorial dispute is resolved. 
  Sarkisov said Russia has a "duty" to return at least 
Shikotan 
and the Habomais under the terms of a 1956 Japan-Soviet joint 
declaration to return the two islands on condition that the 
actual transfer would take place after the signing of a 
bilateral peace treaty. 
  Sarkisov said a settlement to the dispute would include the 
return of at least these two islands as well as a number of 
possible other options which he described as lying between "zero 
and the return of the remaining two islands." He said the 
options could include United Nations administration of the 
islands, or even their joint economic development. 
  "It's a problem of Russian pride," Sarkisov said. "First you 
must explain the facts to the Russian people."

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 7 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and other government officials attended Japan's annual 
rally Monday [7 February], demanding the return to Japan of a 
handful of Russian-held islands off the eastern tip of Hokkaido. 
Among the 1,500 participants in the "Northern Territories Day" 
rally at Kudan Kaikan in central Tokyo were Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata and Koshiro Ishida, head of the Management and 
Coordination Agency. 
  A slide presentation on visa-free exchanges between Japan 
and 
the islands, which were initiated in 1992, and a signature drive 
for a petition demanding the return of the islands are scheduled 
for Monday afternoon. 
  Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomai group of islets 
were seized by Soviet troops at the end of World War II. Japan 
has refused to sign a peace treaty or normalize relations with 
Moscow without a resolution of the islands issue. 
  February 7 was the date of the signing of the 1855 
Russian-Japanese treaty of commerce, navigation and delimitation 
that set the border between Japan and Russia between the islands 
of Etorofu and Urup in the Kuril Archipelago.

give any evidence to back up his statements about the North's 
suspected nuclear arms development program. 
  "It (North Korea) is an unbelievably fanatical society," 
Ozawa said. 
  "There will be a battle to see who inherits power after Kim 
Il- song. There might be an upheaval on the Korean peninsula," 
he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 6 KYODO -- Japan will scale down its 
extraction of plutonium from spent nuclear fuel, power industry 
sources said Sunday [6 February]. The new measures are 
contained in a long-term plan for the development and use of 
nuclear energy being prepared by the Atomic Energy Commission, 
the sources said. 
  Under the plan, the industry will also embark on long-term 
storage of large amounts of spent fuel on site at nuclear power 
stations, the sources said. They said the commission has 
decided to introduce sweeping changes in the fuel recycling 
system, a main pillar of Japan's energy policy, because of 
international disapproval over increased use of plutonium. 
  The sources said the commissioning of a second recycling 
plant planned in addition to one being built by the Japan 
Nuclear Fuel Ltd. at the village of Rokkasho in Aomori 
Prefecture will now be delayed by about 20 years from around 
2010 until 2030. The timing of a third recycling plant would be 
decided around 2010, they said. 
  Delaying the commissioning of the second plant until 2030 
will not affect demand for a plentiful supply of plutonium for a 
fast breeder reactor expected to be operational by that time, 
the sources said. 
  The plant now under construction at Rokkasho is designed to 
handle 800 tons of uranium annually, but spent fuel from the 
nation's power plants annually exceeds this amount and is 
expected to reach around 1,600 tons by 2010. 
  With the postponement of the second plant, Japan's 
reprocessing capacity will be significantly less than the supply 
of spent fuel. The sources said this will necessitate long-term 
storage of spent fuel that cannot be processed at the Rokkasho 
site. 
  Due to the consequent shortage of storage space at nuclear 
facilities, the revised plan suggests that space be sought 
outside the facilities and that existing space be expanded, the 
sources said. 
  Japan's plutonium policy has been a subject in the United 
States Congress. President Bill Clinton has expressed 
understanding of the policy, but has also written to 
congressional opponents of plutonium use to say he shares their 
opinion.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- Amnesty International on 
Friday [4 February] urged a Japanese Government economic survey 
mission to discuss human rights infringements in Indonesia when 
it visits Jakarta from Sunday. 
  In a petition handed to Foreign Ministry officials and 
addressed to Nobuo Matsunaga, who will head the 20-member 
mission, the Japan branch of Amnesty urged Matsunaga to raise 
the issue of human rights abuses in East Timor, Irian Jaya and 
the North Sumatran state of Aceh. 
  Amnesty said it has monitored repeated cases of rape and 
torture of unarmed civilians in East Timor since the Indonesian 
takeover of the former Portuguese colony in 1975. 
  The petition said human rights abuses are common throughout 
Indonesia and that the Indonesian Government has detained more 
than 180 prisoners of conscience and more than 300 political 
prisoners "as a result of trials which are unfair by 
international standards". 
  Matsunaga is a former Japanese ambassador to Mexico and the 
United States and now serves as a roving ambassador for the 
government and adviser to the Foreign Ministry. 
  In June, 1993, Matsunaga told the United Nations World 
Conference on Human Rights in Vienna that expressing concern 
over human rights violations "should not be regarded as 
interference in internal affairs" and that human rights "should 
never be sacrificed to development." 
  The mission, which will stay in Indonesia until February 13, 
will consist of officials from government ministries and 
agencies including the Foreign Ministry, the Finance Ministry, 
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the 
Environment Agency. It will also hold high-level dialogue with 
the Indonesian Government on Japan's basic policy on economic 
cooperation. 
  Japan is the largest donor of ODA to Indonesia.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 7 KYODO -- The government and the 
ruling coalition parties are trying to resolve their differences 
on a tax system reform package before the day is out, Deputy 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobuo Ishihara said Monday [7 February]. 
  Ishihara told a news conference that the push is being made 
to allow the Finance Ministry to compile the draft of the fiscal 
1994 state budget before Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa flies 
to the United States on Thursday. "We have no more time to 
waste. The situation is fairly severe," Ishihara said. 
  Hosokawa is scheduled to meet U.S. President Bill Clinton on 
Friday to assess progress in trade talks being held under a 
bilateral trade framework accord concluded last July. The 
premier will return home Saturday. 
  Coalition parties remained divided over Hosokawa's proposal 
for a 6 trillion yen tax reduction retroactive to January 1 this 
year and a 7 percent tax on goods and services from April 1997. 
  The Social Democratic Party, the largest contingent in the 
seven-party coalition, has threatened to quit the coalition over 
the plan for a "national welfare tax," calling it a thinly 
disguised increase in the consumption tax rate, currently 3 
percent. 
  Washington has voiced hopes for additional pump-priming 
measures by Japan, including a sizable income tax cut, because 
it believes this will help stimulate domestic consumer spending, 
increase imports and slash Japan's bulging trade surplus.

  [Text] With the Council of the Representatives of Ruling 
Coalition Parties deciding to scrap the national welfare tax, 
Prime Minister Hosokawa held a series of meetings today with 
Foreign Minister Hata, Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura, and 
others and made telephone calls to members of the council. 
During the meetings and telephone conversations, the prime 
minister asked them to work for an intraparty coordination of 
views on the issue of securing financial resources to make up 
for a fiscal shortfall resulting from the income tax reduction, 
saying that he intends to draw a conclusion on the issue by 7 
February. 
  Prime Minister Hosokawa held a series of meetings today with 
Foreign Minister Hata, Finance Minister Fujii, and Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Takemura at his official residence. After the meeting 
with the prime minister, Foreign Minister Hata said the prime 
minister told him he would draw a conclusion on the issue by 7 
February. The foreign minister also made it clear that they 
agreed to draw a conclusion on the issue by 7 February. Prime 
Minister Hosokawa met with Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura to 
discuss how to deal with the issue. Asked by a reporter after 
the meeting if there was no change in the prime minister's plan 
to draw a conclusion on the issue by 7 February, Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Takemura said he will have to draw a conclusion by 
that day. 
  Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Hatoyama, who met with the 
prime minister this evening, said the prime minister, speaking 
by telephone with representatives of the ruling coalition 
parties, asked them to coordinate views of the ruling coalition 
parties on the issue at the council. 
  Sakigake [Harbinger) and the Japan New Party affirmed their 
support for the national welfare tax, but proposed that the 
coalition parties discuss how to set its tax rate, when to put 
the new tax into effect, and draw a conclusion on them before 
the current Diet session ends. The two parties notified their 
affirmation and proposal to the prime minister. In response, the 
prime minister said: I hope the ruling coalition parties will 
fully discussion the issue and I intend to draw a conclusion on 
the issue by 7 February in light of compilation of the fiscal 
1994 budget. 
  The ruling coalition parties held today a meeting of their 
secretaries in charge of tax affairs to discuss ways to handle 
the income tax reduction and secure financial resources to make 
up for a fiscal shortfall from the income tax cut, but no 
headway was made at the meeting.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 5 KYODO -- Prime minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa met with key members of his cabinet Saturday [5 
February] in a bid to mend a rift within the coalition 
government by Monday over his proposal for a new indirect tax 
that led to a near breakdown of the six-month-old alliance, his 
aides said. 
  Among the key officials Hosokawa met separately at his 
official residence were Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi 
Takemura, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata, and Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii. 
  Hosokawa insisted that the new 7 percent levy on almost all 
goods and services, known as the "National Welfare Tax," is 
indispensable to secure funds for a 6 trillion yen tax 
reduction, which is a key element in the 15 trillion yen 
stimulus package, the aides said. 
  Political sources said the rift among the coalition parties 
is too deep to be healed by Monday, and could affect the 
government's efforts to compile the fiscal 1994 budget. The 
Hosokawa cabinet is scheduled to decide on the pump-priming 
package on Monday, a fiscal 1994 economic projection on 
Wednesday and a Finance Ministry budget plan for fiscal 1994 on 
Thursday. 
  Later on Thursday, Hosokawa is scheduled to leave Tokyo for 
a 
summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington the next 
day. 
  If things do not go smoothly, the government's plan to adopt 
the fiscal 1994 budget by February 15 may have to be delayed 
until February 20, political sources said. 
  In an early morning news conference on February 3, Hosokawa 
proposed reducing 6 trillion yen of taxes retroactive to January 
1 and replacing the present 3 percent consumption tax with the 7 
percent national welfare tax in April 1997. But the proposal 
hit major opposition from the Social Democratic Party, the 
largest among the seven parties in the ruling coalition, which 
threatened to quit the coalition unless the fresh tax plan was 
dropped. Even members of Hosokawa's Japan New Party voiced 
opposition to the new tax. 
  Coalition leaders went into huddles to debate the proposal 
and finally scrapped Hosokawa's tax cut and increase program on 
Friday, about 35 hours after Hosokawa's announcement. 
  On Saturday, policy-makers of coalition parties held an 
emergency meeting and reached a basic agreement on several key 
issues, including the 6 trillion yen tax cut plan, government 
sources said. The agreement also called for the establishment 
of a consultative body to discuss ways to raise funds for the 
tax cut, the sources said. 
  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told a news conference in 
Gifu, central Japan, that the 6 trillion yen tax cut should be 
carried out separately from the new tax proposal because it is 
part of the government's pledge to the United States. 
  He said the new tax proposal surfaced all of a sudden and 
still needs time for a careful study. 
  Murayama proposed forming a consultative panel from the 
coalition parties to discuss measures to fund the tax reduction. 
  The panel should discuss a vision to promote public welfare 
and administrative and fiscal reforms, while taking into account 
the domestic economic situation, he said. 
  Ichiro Ozawa, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] co-leader and 
the coalition's chief strategist, in a commercial television 
program aired Saturday, said the new tax is important for the 
graying Japanese society. 
  He said the welfare tax concept has gone through a 
democratic 
process, because it has been discussed by representatives of all 
the ruling parties since last year. 
  Yohei Kono, president of the main opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party, said Hosokawa and other responsible officials 
have to be blamed for the controversy. 
  "Remarks by the top political leader of a country bear heavy 
responsibility. To our great regret, Mr. Hosokawa showed a lack 
of principle," Kono said at a news conference in Otsu. 
  Kono urged the ruling coalition to make public the course of 
developments that led to Hosokawa's news conference to announce 
the imposition of the new indirect tax. He also said those who 
were involved in the developments must shoulder the blame.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 5 KYODO -- Japan's major dailies 
Saturday [5 February] called on the ruling coalition to unify 
opinions on a tax cut and formulate an economic stimulus package 
as soon as possible. 
  The ASAHI SHIMBUN said, "the attitude to scrap everything 
could not get support from the people nor understanding from the 
international community." 
  The major daily was referring to Friday's decision by the 
seven ruling coalition parties to scrap Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa plans to introduce a new indirect tax and implement a 
tax cut. 
  Hosokawa's package calls for a 6 trillion yen reduction in 
income tax and for replacing the current 3 percent consumption 
tax with a 7 percent "national welfare tax." 
  The leading daily urged the coalition to make its 
decision-making process transparent, noting that bureaucrats at 
the Finance Ministry might have pulled some behind-the-scene 
strings, hand-in-hand with a few influential coalition members 
in drawing up the tax plan. 
  The ASAHI also asked the coalition parties to calm down and 
immediately unify their views on economic policies. "Otherwise, 
the centripetal influence of the coalition would decay," the 
ASAHI said. 
  The MAINICHI SHIMBUN also slammed the government for its 
blurred process that brought about the plan, labeling it as "a 
decision without the people." 
  "If those who participated in making the decision were only 
a 
few people as reported, including Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party] leader Ichiro Ozawa and those from the Finance Ministry, 
without holding sufficient discussions within the government and 
the coalition, it is a reckless act that tramples the basic 
principles of democracy," the MAINICHI said. 
  It is rational for the Social Democratic Party, which was 
suddenly pressed to accept the tax plan, to have threatened to 
quit the coalition, the national daily said. 
  The prime minister should adjust opinions on a tax cut and 
its resources, and start drafting the fiscal 1994 budget after 
gaining a happy compromise, the MAINICHI said. 
  The largest circulation YOMIURI SHIMBUN said, "the Unusual 
situation revealed the structural limitation of the coalition 
government which is a hodgepodge of political parties with 
different political stance and basic policies." 
  "Under ordinary circumstances, a cabinet that committed such 
a serious blunder would have to resign en masse. However, it is 
not allowed to create a political vacuum in the face of such 
urgent problems as pump-priming, the fiscal 1994 state budget 
and relations with the United States," it said. 
  "Revocation of the prime minister's tax plan leaves deep 
cracks in the coalition and seriously deteriorates the 
leadership of the government," the daily said. 
  The YOMIURI urged the government to restructure itself to 
deal with the political quagmire. 
  The leading economic daily NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN said, "The 
government should recognize the severity of the economy bogged 
down in the worst recession in the postwar era and rush to 
fine-tune pump-priming measures by returning to its original 
stance of first implementing tax reductions." 
  "The government and the coalition should recall that what is 
needed for the Japanese economy in the serious recession is to 
carry out a large-scale income tax first," it said. 
  The NIHON KEIZAI asked the opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party to offer concrete proposals to the government if it 
recognizes the Japanese economy is facing a crisis.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "NHK News" </F>
program] 
  [Text] While discussions are starting anew on the concept 
of reducing the income tax and instead instituting a public 
welfare tax as a source of revenue to cover the shortfalls 
resulting therefrom, the coalition parties started the work of 
finalizing key points of the 1994 budget in a policy meeting 
this morning. 
  The coalition parties held a meeting of the Policy Affairs 
Council at the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] 
headquarters and began a final review of ministries' budget 
requests and details of the tax revenue plan, while excluding 
from it the matter of reducing the income tax and covering the 
shortfalls therefrom. The government is hoping to have a 
Finance Ministry draft of the 1994 budget completed [for 
submission to the cabinet] by 10 February. 
  Party officials in charge of taxation are due to join this 
meeting in the afternoon. 
  In the afternoon meeting, the parties are expected to 
exchange views concerning how the government and the ruling 
parties should adjust their stands on the question of financial 
resources to fund the cuts in revenue. 
  Meanwhile, Ichiro Ozawa, general secretary of Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party], when speaking on a commercial television 
program this morning, said that even though the mass media have 
claimed that the public welfare tax came out of nowhere, it has 
been discussed time and again in following the appropriate steps 
in the coalition parties. He said that people should stop 
speaking out emotionally and instead should start discussing the 
substance of the matter in a calmer manner. 
  On the other hand, Koken Nosaka, chairman of the SDPJ Diet 
Affairs Committee, spoke on a different television program and 
said: It is all right to discuss sources of revenue necessary 
for welfare, but the party's view is that two to three years 
should be allotted to such discussions. He said that the SDPJ 
has no choice but to quit the government should the latter 
insist on pushing ahead and going ahead with the plan.

  [Text] Otsu, Feb. 5 KYODO -- Liberal Democratic Party 
President Yohei Kono on Saturday [5 February] urged the Social 
Democratic Party [of Japan, SDPJ], the largest of the seven 
parties in the ruling coalition, to part with Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party], the No. 2 governing party. 
  Kono, speaking at an LDP fund-raising party in Otsu, asked, 
"can the SDP share political responsibility with Shinseito?" 
  Shinseto co-leader Ichiro Ozawa, who is regarded as the 
coalition's chief strategist, has called for raising the 
consumption tax rate to 10 percent from present 3 percent, Kono 
said. 
  The SDP strongly opposed the consumption tax, a value-added 
tax, when it was imposed five years ago on almost all goods and 
services. 
  Earlier this week, the SDP opposed Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's proposal to replace the 3 percent consumption tax 
with a 7 percent "National Welfare Tax" in three years' time. 
  Kono, leader of the biggest opposition party, said he does 
not think the present government's policies will benefit the 
Japanese people. 
  "The LDP will struggle with a firm resolve to establish a 
government that can meet the expectations of the people," he 
said. 
  Kono also expressed concern with Komeito for joining the 
coalition, saying he cannot agree with Komeito's deep 
involvement in the country's policymaking. 
  He alluded to Komeito's links with Japan's largest Buddhist 
lay organization, the Soka Gakkai. 
  Komeito is the fourth largest group in the coalition, 
following the SDP, Shinseito and the parliamentary alliance of 
Hosokawa's Japan New Party and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi 
Takemura's Sakigake (Harbinger).

  [Text] At a news conference in Gifu City, today Tomiichi 
Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ], stated that a 6-trillion-yen reduction in income and 
residential tax is necessary to boost the sluggish economy. 
With regard to a source to finance the proposed tax cuts, 
Chairman Murayama indicated that a consultative body should be 
set up to make a decision on this issue while watching the 
economic trend. 
  [Begin Murayama recording] A consultative body has to be set 
up to decide on a revenue source for implementing tax cuts, and 
it is necessary to watch the economic situation after economic 
pump priming measures are taken. In line with discussion on 
administrative reform, a welfare vision, and other issues, a 
decision should be made on how to cover the cost of the proposed 
tax cuts. [end recording] 
  Chairman Murayama said such a view is basically the same as 
views of Sakigake [Harbinger] and the Democratic Socialist 
Party. He indicated that it would be possible to reach an 
accord if the ruling parties make no bones about the timing for 
making the decision at the proposed consultative body. 
Moreover, Chairman Murayama reiterated his criticism of the 
idea of introducing the National Welfare Tax. He indicated that 
the SDPJ for its part intends to demand that a pension-oriented 
tax be introduced to finance basic pensions.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 5 KYODO -- Policy-makers of the seven 
parties in the ruling coalition agreed Saturday [5 February] to 
expand relief measures for land taxes as part of tax reforms for 
fiscal 1994, party officials said. 
  The agreement calls for lightening the tax burden on capital 
gains on real estate. It also proposes making land used for 
public purposes such as parking subject to tax relief on a new 
land tax called the land value tax, they said. 
  These measures will be included in a tax reform package 
expected to be announced early next week, they noted.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 6 KYODO -- Ichiro Ozawa, a main 
strategist for the coalition government, suggested his readiness 
Sunday [6 February] to make all-out concessions to the Social 
Democratic Party (SDP) over the issue of creating a new tax to 
make up for revenue shortfalls from planned large-scale income 
and residential tax cuts. Commenting on Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's proposal to introduce a 7 percent indirect tax, Ozawa 
said on a television show that he accepts the idea of setting up 
a new tax as a special purpose levy on condition that the public 
will approve. 
  In a predawn news conference Thursday, Hosokawa announced 
the 
plan to impose the 7 percent "national welfare tax" on almost 
all goods and services from April 1997. It would replace the 
current 3 percent consumption tax, whose revenues go into the 
nation's general account budget. 
  In protest against the new tax, the SDP, the largest force 
in 
the seven-party coalition government, has threatened to withdraw 
its six ministers from the cabinet and quit the government, 
saying the new tax would amount to a de facto doubling of the 
current consumption tax. 
  The SDP has demanded that any increase in revenue from the 
new tax be specifically allocated for welfare purposes and that 
a forum be set up within the coalition to discuss when the tax 
should be raised and by how much. 
  Leaders of the government and coalition parties will meet 
again Monday to seek a compromise on the matter. 
  Differences within the coalition parties and the government 
over the issue have forced the government to delay announcing a 
much-awaited massive economic stimulus package, including 5.3 
trillion yen in income and residential tax cuts.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 6 KYODO -- Leaders of the ruling 
coalition parties agreed Sunday [6 February] to settle on Monday 
a rift over how to finance a 6 trillion yen tax cut and to 
launch a 15 trillion yen fresh pump-priming package, coalition 
officials said. Heads of the seven parties, except Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, reached the agreement at a meeting 
at the head office of Rengo, Japan's largest labor organization, 
which played a key role in helping the parties form the 
coalition last April. 
  Leaders of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Shinseito 
(Japan Renewal Party), Komeito, the Democratic Socialist Party 
(DSP), Sakigake (Harbinger), and the United Social Democratic 
Party (USDP) attended the meeting. 
  The chief of the Democratic Reform Party, a minor 
parliamentary group in the House of Councillors, also joined. 
Hosokawa, who heads the Japan New Party (JNP), was absent. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who met Hosokawa 
at his official residence, told reporters that Hosokawa hopes 
for a solution to the tax dispute as early as Sunday, and by 
Monday at the latest. 
  Takemura said, "the prime minister will give a decision if 
representatives of the coalition parties cannot reach a 
solution." 
  At Sunday's meeting, the coalition leaders agreed to first 
implement the 6 trillion tax reductions and to establish an 
interparty consultative body to discuss a new 7 percent indirect 
tax, which Hosokawa proposed as a revenue source for the cuts. 
  Rengo President Akira Yamagishi told a news conference that 
he will ask the coalition to reach a conclusion in one year's 
time on the matter of revenue sources. 
  "I hope the coalition will decide in one year. There will be 
no progress as long as the SDP continues to insist on two years' 
time," Yamagishi said. 
  The SDP, the largest among the seven ruling parties, has 
called for a large tax cut and for discussion in two years on 
how to finance the tax reduction. 
  Other coalition parties have agreed to formulate a 
conclusion 
in one year's time. 
  Attendees at the Sunday gathering were SDP Chairman Tomiichi 
Murayama, Shinseito leader Tsutomu Hata, Komeito Chairman 
Koshiro Ishida, DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi, Sakigake leader 
Takemura, USDP head Satsuki Eda, and Yasumatsu Hoshikawa, head 
of the Democratic Reform Party. 
  In the coalition, Hata serves as deputy prime minister and 
foreign minister, Ishida as director general of the Management 
and Coordination Agency, Ouchi as health and welfare minister, 
and Eda as director general of the Science and Technology 
Agency. The seven met before attending Rengo's Central 
Executive Committee session. 
  Meanwhile, Shinseito co-leader Ichiro Ozawa, a main 
strategist for the coalition government, suggested his readiness 
Sunday to make all-out concessions to the SDP. 
  Ozawa, appearing on Fuji TV's "News Report 2001" talk show, 
said he accepts the idea of imposing the new indirect tax as a 
special-purpose levy for welfare affairs only. 
  Last week, Hosokawa announced a 6 trillion yen tax cut 
retroactive to January 1 and also proposed imposing a 7 percent 
"National Welfare Tax" effective from April 1997 to offset 
resultant revenue shortfalls. But the tax cut and increase 
program hit a snag in the wake of strong opposition from the 
SDP, which threatened to quit the coalition unless the new tax 
plan was dropped. 
  On Friday, the coalition scrapped Hosokawa's program and 
agreed to spend more time discussing it, averting a major 
political crisis that could lead to a breakup of the 
six-month-old Hosokawa cabinet. 
  Hosokawa has repeatedly expressed hope for an early solution 
to the tax dispute in time for his departure to the United 
States on Thursday for a summit with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton. The Clinton administration has been urging Japan to 
take drastic economic stimulus measures to pull its slumbering 
economy out of a recession, revive consumer spending and thereby 
pare down Japan's huge trade surplus with the United States 
totaling 50 billion dollars annually. 
  Government sources said the Hosokawa cabinet was compiling 
the 15 trillion yen stimulus package featuring the 6 trillion 
yen tax cut as well as increased public works spending in the 
face of a veiled U.S. threat to invoke its Super 301 
retaliatory trade provision. 
  The SDP has blasted Hosokawa's tax plan as a ploy to force 
the nation to accept a de facto more than double the current 3 
percent consumption tax rate, and merely renaming it a "National 
Welfare Tax." 
  The SDP has argued that the coalition should insert into the 
legislation wording that would ensure all fresh revenue from the 
new tax be used solely for welfare purposes. But the Finance 
Ministry has resisted the demand, saying that such a provision 
would tie the hands of the government in funneling the revenue 
to fund various policy measures. 
  The SDP has insisted on the abolition of the consumption tax 
imposed five years ago. It boosted its parliamentary strength 
in a 1989 House of Councillors election shortly after the then 
cabinet of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita imposed the levy.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 7 KYODO -- A senior trade ministry 
official Monday [7 February] indirectly defended the 
controversial new 7 percent national welfare tax proposed by 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa last week. 
  The idea of replacing the current 3 percent consumption tax 
with the welfare tax in April 1997 was not conceived "abruptly" 
as widely reported, Hideaki Kumano, vice international trade and 
industry minister, told a regular press conference. 
  The idea resulted from full-fledged discussion on reform of 
the tax system that was launched by the government's tax 
commission last September, Kumano said. 
  Creation of the best tax system to meet the needs of the 
graying society was one of the aims Hosokawa mentioned in a new 
year speech and the Advisory Group for Economic Restructuring, 
an advisory body to the premier, called for a system suitable on 
a long-term basis toward the next century. 
  The Social Democratic Party, the largest party in the ruling 
coalition, dismissed the welfare tax as having been announced 
without proper procedures being followed among parties concerned. 
  Apparently in response to strong criticism of the new tax 
from both the SDP and the public, Hosokawa retracted the 
original proposal a day after announcing it. 
  At present, views are being coordinated to form a new 
consensus among the seven parties in Hosokawa's coalition. 
  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is waiting 
for "a political decision" to settle the matter, Kumano said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 7 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry [MOF] 
is to draft a new plan, including linking tax cuts and tax 
hikes, a senior ministry official said Monday [7 February]. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa ordered Finance Minister 
Hirohisa Fujii to revise a previous tax plan announced by the 
premier last week, after leaders of the coalition parties asked 
the government on Monday to come up with a new plan, the 
official at the ministry's tax bureau said. But the ministry, 
he said, will "not change its policy to include tax cuts and 
hike in a single program." 
  The official declined to comment on whether the new plan 
would call for a tax which limits revenue use to special 
purposes. 
  Hosokawa told Fujii to draft a plan "as soon as possible," 
the official said. Hosokawa last week announced a "national 
welfare tax" similar to the consumption tax to offset income and 
corporate tax cuts, but the ruling coalition rejected the 
proposal. 
  The ministry official later corrected his comments, saying 
the Prime Minister's Office contacted Fujii again to explain 
that Hosokawa told the coalition leaders he would have the 
Finance and Home Affairs Ministries "help" the coalition form a 
new tax plan. 
  Hosokawa told Sakigake representative Hiroyuki Sonoda to 
reach a final decision on the tax plan at the coalition meeting, 
according to the Finance Ministry official.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 7 KYODO -- The governing coalition 
apparently made no progress in a Monday [7 February] afternoon 
meeting aimed at crafting a tax reform package, a senior Finance 
Ministry official said. "There is no change in the situation," 
the official, who declined to be identified, said on returning 
to his office after meeting coalition leaders. 
  The official said the ministry is sticking to its policy 
that 
any tax cut be linked explicitly with the timing and rate of 
other measures that would fund the loss of revenue. He declined 
further comment. 
  "The administrative side is united with the (finance) 
minister who insists that the issue be dealt with in one go," 
said Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito. "In that sense, we 
haven't changed our stance." 
  Saito confirmed that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
ordered 
Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii to help the coalition parties in 
"technical aspects" to make a final decision on the tax issue. 
He would not comment further, saying it would be inappropriate 
when the coalition parties are still holding negotiations. 
  After Fujii was summoned to the prime minister's residence, 
the senior ministry official told reporters that the ministry 
had been ordered to draft a new plan. But he later amended his 
remarks, saying the prime minister's office contacted Fujii 
again to say that Hosokawa told the coalition leaders he would 
have the finance and home affairs ministries "help" the 
coalition form a tax plan. 
  With that support, Hosokawa told Sakigake [Harbinger] 
representative Hiroyuki Sonoda to decide on the coalition's plan 
at the meeting, the official said. 
  The coalition has been in turmoil over the tax issue, a key 
component of the government's promised economic stimulus 
package, which was to have been issued Friday. 
  Hosokawa announced a package early Thursday of 6 trillion 
yen 
in tax cuts to be offset in 1997 by raising the 3 percent 
consumption tax to a 7 percent "national welfare tax." 
  But the plan was sent back to the drawing board because of 
stiff opposition led by socialists in the coalition. They 
demanded that the tax increase be delayed and any new taxes be 
earmarked for programs to address the country's aging society. 
  The socialists, who form the biggest bloc in the seven-party 
coalition, threatened to quit -- leaving Hosokawa with a weak, 
minority government. Hosokawa told Fujii to draft a new plan 
"as soon as possible," the official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 7 KYODO -- The leader of the 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on Monday [7 February] 
urged Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to keep his word to 
implement a tax cut or hand over power to the LDP. "The prime 
minister must take responsible action and live up to the words 
he has uttered so explicitly," LDP President Yohei Kono said in 
a lecture delivered in Tokyo. 
  On the issue of tax policy, Kono said the government "cannot 
take a sweeping political decision without the cooperation of 
the LDP, but we are reluctant to extend support since the 
government is so indecisive." 
  Kono was apparently referring to the ruling coalition 
leaders' decision last Friday to rescind Hosokawa's plan to 
finance a 6 trillion yen tax cut this year with the imposition 
of a 7 percent indirect levy on most goods and services sold in 
Japan, starting in 1997. 
  "When the coalition cabinet was inaugurated, Hosokawa used 
to 
say he will formulate policies from the standpoint of ordinary 
people. Where is his standpoint at this moment?" he asked.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 7 KYODO -- Kan Kato, the head of the 
government's Tax Commission, on Monday [7 February] reiterated 
his opposition to the idea of reducing income tax without 
securing funds to finance the lost revenues. Implementing tax 
cuts in such a manner would pose "a great problem" to the 
overall tax structure, Kato told a press conference after 
attending the commission's general meeting. 
  He rejected the latest proposal by the Social Democratic 
Party (SDP) to first of all implement a tax cut to turn around 
the ailing economy, while a consultative body considers how to 
cover the cuts. 
  The political wrangling over the tax issue turned serious 
when Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa decided to introduce the 7 
percent "National Welfare Tax" last week. Faced with strong 
opposition from the SDP, the largest force in the coalition 
government, Hosokawa retracted the decision the day after 
announcing it. 
  In a bid to break the impasse, SDP Chairman Tomiichi 
Murayama 
proposed setting up a consultative body and allowing it two 
years to decide how to cover the lost revenues. There is no 
guarantee that the consultative body would come to a conclusion 
within a fixed period of time, Kato said, terming the SDP's plan 
"a hypothetical guarantee." 
  Kato then cited the possibility of tax cuts being slashed 
from the original figure of 6 trillion yen, if funds to repay 
them are not ensured. 
  The Tax Commission is still firmly in favor of linking the 
tax cut and hike as proposed in its report to the prime minister 
last November, Kato said. 
  Monday's general meeting by the commission is intended to 
wrap up a tax reform plan for fiscal 1994, starting in April. 
If the current political confusion continues, the release of a 
reform proposal would be delayed from the scheduled date of 
Wednesday.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 7 KYODO -- Representatives of the 
seven ruling coalition parties failed Monday [7 February] to 
reach a compromise on how to finance a 6 trillion yen tax cut, a 
pillar of the government's planned stimulus package, and only 
agreed to meet Tuesday, coalition sources said. 
  The representatives held three rounds of talks on and off 
throughout Monday in a bid to revise Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's tax program that is still threatening to split his 
coalition. They agreed to meet at 10:30 A.M. [0130 GMT] 
Tuesday, the sources said. 
  The third round, which started at around 7:00 P.M. after the 
previous two rounds broke down, lasted only one hour, because of 
persistent opposition from the Social Democratic Party (SDP), 
which is demanding a major revision to the program, the sources 
said. In an eleventh-hour bid to placate the SDP, Hosokawa 
instructed his colleague, Hiroyuki Sonoda, to sketch out a 
compromise version of the program combining a new indirect tax 
with a tax cut. 
  Sonoda, leader of the alliance of Sakigake (Harbinger) and 
the Japan New Party, immediately devised and presented the 
compromise version at a meeting of representatives of the 
coalition parties, only to find the SDP remaining unconvinced. 
  The SDP threatened last Thursday to quit the coalition 
unless 
Hosokawa agrees to accept its demands to revise the core aspects 
of the tax proposal, including a demand to insert a clause 
obliging all revenue from the new tax to be used for 
welfare-related outlays. Hosokawa, however, has remained 
reluctant to completely redesign his national welfare tax 
program, making it difficult to narrow the gulf with the SDP, 
they said. 
  The SDP is the biggest force in the coalition. Its 
withdrawal would lead to the breakup of the coalition. 
  Hosokawa wants the issue settled before his departure on 
Thursday for the United States for a summit with President Bill 
Clinton. 
  In the morning meeting, SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo 
told his coalition counterparts that the party will not agree to 
further talks unless Hosokawa agrees to revise core aspects of 
the tax plan. 
  The SDP also demanded that the coalition not specify the 
rate 
of tax when introducing the text of the proposed legislation 
onto the Diet floor, they said. 
  Kubo told the coalition leaders during the morning session, 
"if this parley is merely designed to convince us to accept the 
original tax proposal, we cannot help but turn it down." 
However, Kubo said that if the coalition devised satisfactory 
revision proposals, the party would agree to further 
negotiations. 
  The Clinton administration has called on Tokyo to take steps 
to implement tax cuts as a way of reviving stagnant consumer 
spending and to whittle down Japan's huge trade surplus.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 7 KYODO -- Japan's governing coalition 
agreed Monday [7 February] to a 6 trillion yen income tax cut, 
postponing for a day the details of paying for it, government 
and coalition officials said. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
agreed that the government will settle the divisive tax-cut 
issue by midday Tuesday, announce its delayed economic stimulus 
package in the evening and meet its Friday deadline for the 
Finance Ministry to craft its fiscal 1994 budget draft, Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi takemura said. 
  After a day of fruitless meetings and dashed compromise 
plans, coalition leaders agreed in the evening to essentially 
scrap Hosokawa's plan to change the 3 percent consumption tax to 
a 7 percent "National Welfare Tax" in 1997, sources said. 
  Instead, they will meet at 10:30 A.M. Tuesday to deal with 
setting up a consultative body of coalition members to decide 
within a year on funding the income tax cut, a key component of 
the stimulus package, the sources said. 
  Divorcing the stimulative tax cut from a hike in indirect 
taxes has been a key demand of the coalition's biggest member, 
the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which has threatened to quit 
the coalition if Hosokawa did not revise the welfare tax scheme 
he announced early Thursday. But the powerful Finance Ministry 
has been dead-set against the decoupling, insisting as late as 
Monday afternoon that any law cutting income taxes must 
explicitly set out the timing and rate of the offsetting tax 
hike. 
  Despite Hosokawa's apparent confidence in getting the 
budget draft out as planned by Thursday, when he leaves for a 
Washington summit with President Bill Clinton, the Finance 
Ministry indicated that the prolonged bickering was straining an 
already tight schedule. 
  The U.S. Government has repeatedly called for Japan to spur 
its domestic demand to boost imports and cut Tokyo's huge trade 
surplus. But the ministry will not be able to complete its 
draft budget for the coming fiscal year by Friday if the 
coalition does not settle the funding issue Tuesday, a ministry 
official said. 
  As it is, the coalition's failure to agree Monday on funding 
the cuts will make it "very difficult" for the government's Tax 
Commission to complete its final tax reform report for fiscal 
1994 by its Wednesday deadline, which could affect the timing of 
the draft budget, a senior ministry tax bureau official said. 
  On the other hand, SDP leaders indicated approval of the 
plan 
to set up a consultative body to seek a funding agreement within 
a year, a plan that closely resembles the SDP's latest 
compromise proposal. 
  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama met with other party leaders 
and appeared ready to accept the plan, but he chose to hold off 
on formal approval until the government made its next move, 
sources said. 
  The agreement on the 6 trillion yen in tax cuts, of which 
5.3 
trillion would be income and residential tax reductions, while 
putting off the thorny question of funding, followed three 
meetings of coalition leaders Monday and vain attempts to 
placate the SDP, sources said. 
  The SDP rebuffed proposals through the day. The party has 
said even talking about tax hikes is bad for the teetering 
economy and that any eventual revenues must be earmarked for 
welfare-related spending. 
  The day's proposals included one ordered by Hosokawa and 
crafted by his colleague Hiroyuki Sonoda, leader of the alliance 
of Sakigake (Harbinger) and the Japan New Party, combining a new 
indirect tax with the tax cuts. 
  In the rush to cobble together new plans, Hosokawa summoned 
Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii to direct him to draw up a new 
ministry plan, then phoned Fujii minutes later to explain that 
the ministry was instead to help with the Sonoda plan, a 
bewildered ministry official said in the afternoon. 
  When the SDP balked at the Sonoda compromise, the secretary 
of coalition member party Komeito, Yuichi Ichikawa, stepped in 
with the plan that sealed the evening's half-agreement, sources 
said. 
  Under the plan, the name "welfare tax" would be scrapped and 
the consultative body would try to "deal responsibly" with the 
funding within a year, the sources said. 
  It remained unclear how the Finance Ministry and Tax 
Commission would respond. As late as Monday afternoon, both 
continued to blast the idea of cutting taxes now with only the 
vague promises of politicians as collateral for repayment. 
  A ministry official said in the afternoon there was no 
change 
in the ministry's stance. Fujii has repeatedly rejected any 
such unspecified funding scheme as "untreated," using a word 
usually reserved for raw sewage or human incontinence.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 7 KYODO -- A failure to agree on 
funding for tax cuts in talks between the seven ruling coalition 
parties has made it difficult for the government's Tax 
Commission to announce a tax reform plan for fiscal 1994 by 
Wednesday, a senior Finance Ministry official said Monday [7 
February]. 
  "We are facing the final time limit," the tax bureau 
official 
said in a brief exchange with reporters after Monday's talks 
failed. The comment came after the coalition party leaders left 
the negotiation table without agreeing on the key issue of how 
to finance the proposed tax cuts of 6 trillion yen. 
  Due to lingering political wrangling over the tax issue, the 
release of the next year's tax reform outline has already been 
postponed from Tuesday, as originally scheduled. 
  It is not technically impossible to announce the tax outline 
on Wednesday, if a consensus is reached at resumed talks 
Tuesday, the official said. But he added that it has become 
"very difficult" to do so in view of the likely revisions in the 
original tax proposal by the Tax Commission, the official said. 
  The commission, an advisory body to the prime minister, 
recommended in a report presented to him last November linking a 
tax cut with a tax hike to finance it in a single law. 
  A further delay in outlining the next year's tax reform 
would 
affect political and economic schedules that follow, including 
the government's announcement of Japan's economic growth target 
for fiscal 1994, formation of the Finance Ministry's draft 
budget for the year and the Japan-U.S summit in Washington on 
Friday, the official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 7 KYODO -- An outline of a fiscal 1994 
tax reform proposal with the emphasis on rectification of tax 
inequities has been laid down, officials said Monday [7 
February]. The outline, worked out by the government's tax 
commission, also calls for a relaxation of land taxes and a 
raise in the tax on non-whiskey liquors. 
  Details of the proposed 5.3 trillion yen income and resident 
tax cuts will be worked out after an agreement among the seven 
coalition parties on how to finance the tax reduction, 
commission officials said. The commission is due to announce a 
tax reform proposal on Wednesday. 
  A proposal to correct tax inequalities calls mainly for: 
  -- 10 percent of enterprise expense accounts, even within 
the 
currently nontaxable limit, will be uniformly taxed; 
  -- The nontaxable portion of business revenues of 
nonprofit foundations like religious organizations will be 
reduced; 
  -- A punitively heavy tax will be levied on funds whose 
uses are not accounted for.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 7 KYODO -- The seven ruling coalition 
parties' policy coordinators agreed on the details Monday [7 
February] of an increase in liquor tax rates on beer, sake and 
shochu (Japanese white distilled liquor) in response to 
complaints from European Union nations. The tax rates on 
whiskey, however, will be left unchanged. 
  The raise will increase the tax on beer by 8.86 yen per 633 
milliliter bottle. The retail price of beer is likely to rise 
by 10 yen per bottle, coordinators said. 
  The raise, which will become effective in May at the 
earliest, has been sought by the EU countries, which complained 
that liquor tax rates on shochu are much lower than those on 
whiskey. 
  As a result of the increase, tax rates on whiskey will be 
3.9 
times those on grade A shochu instead of the existing 5.1 times, 
and 6.0 times those on grade B shochu instead of the current 8.7 
times, the coordinators said. 
  The tax on sake will increase the price of a 1.8 liter 
bottle 
by 12.6 yen.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 7 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry will 
be unable to draft its fiscal 1994 budget and the third fiscal 
1993 extra budget before Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa meets 
President Bill Clinton on Friday if the coalition parties fail 
to agree on the tax issue on Tuesday, a ministry official said 
Monday [7 February]. His comments came after leaders of the 
coalition parties agreed on a 6 trillion yen tax cut but decided 
to convene again Tuesday to fill in the remaining gaps on how to 
finance the cut. 
  The budget bureau official, requesting anonymity, told 
reporters that even if a final decision is made, the ministry 
would have to work on a tight schedule for the budgets. 
  The advisory tax panel to the prime minister was scheduled 
to 
submit its report on fiscal 1994 tax reform, but postponed it 
until Wednesday. 
  But a tax bureau official told reporters that it would 
become 
difficult for the panel to submit the report by Wednesday, 
saying, "we are facing the final deadline." It is not 
technically impossible to announce the outline on Wednesday, if 
a consensus is reached at resumed talks Tuesday, he said. 
  But he added that it has become "very difficult" to do so in 
view of the likely revisions in the original tax proposal. 
  The panel recommended in a "medium-term" tax reform report 
last November linking in a single law an income tax cut with a 
consumption tax hike to offset it. The budget bureau official 
said if the schedule does not go smoothly, the ministry will 
have to put off the budget announcements until February 14 or 
after.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 7 KYODO -- Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman 
of Japan's top automaker Toyota Motor Corp., has been named new 
chairman of the powerful Federation of Economic Organizations 
(Keidanren), federation officials said Monday [7 February]. 
  Toyoda, 68, will succeed Chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa after the 
federation's general meeting scheduled for late May, the 
officials said. 
  Toyoda's selection was endorsed at a meeting between Hiraiwa 
and the organization's vice chairmen, they said. 
  Toyoda, who is currently one of the federation's vice 
chairmen, told reporters after the meeting he will seek the 
cooperation of other officials in managing the federation. 
  Hiraiwa, 79, said Toyoda's appointment as his successor will 
rejuvenate the federation's leadership. 
  Toyoda said after the meeting he would emphasize economic 
recovery and try to contribute to a healthy growth in the 
Japanese economy. 
  Masaru Hayami, head of the Japan Association of Corporate 
Executives (Keizai Doyukai), welcomed the selection of Toyoda as 
Keidanren's next chairman, citing automobile trade as the core 
of economic relations between Japan and the United States. 
  He expressed the hope that Toyoda will demonstrate the 
leadership, independent of the automobile industry, to cope with 
the difficult problems facing the Japanese economy. 
  Yoshinari Yamashiro, chairman of major steelmaker NKK Corp., 
said the federation will be able to tackle Japan-U.S. trade 
problems seriously under the new leadership. 
  Toyoda emerged as the strongest contender for the post after 
Akio Morita, chairman of Sony Corp. and one of the federation's 
vice chairmen, became ill last November. 
  Four vice chairmen of the federation, including Toyoda, are 
scheduled to quit their posts after serving two consecutive 
four- year terms and three successors have already been 
informally selected, Keidanren officials said. 
  The three new officers will be Sho Nasu, chairman of Tokyo 
Electric Power Co., Kenichi Suematsu, president of Sakura Bank, 
and Yotaro Kobayashi, chairman of Fuji Xerox Co. They will 
replace Ryoichi Kawai, chairman of Komatsu Ltd., Yotaro Iida, 
chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., and Hiroshi Saito, 
chairman of Nippon Steel Corp.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 7 KYODO -- Japan's current account 
surplus soared to a new record last year, with the surplus in 
December rising 9.3 percent, the Finance Ministry reported 
Monday [7 February]. 
  The surplus in the current account, the broadest measure of 
trade in goods and services plus some unilateral transfers, 
totaled 131.35 billion dollars before adjustment for seasonal 
factors in 1993, up 11.7 percent from 1992, according to the 
ministry's preliminary report. 
  Within the current account, the merchandise trade surplus 
rose 6.9 percent to 141.43 billion dollars last year. 
  In December alone, the current account surplus rose 9.3 
percent to 12.57 billion dollars, resuming an upward trend that 
halted in November. The December trade surplus rose 8.7 percent 
to 14.15 billion dollars.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- The Ministry of Finance [MOF] 
unveiled new administrative guidance Friday [4 February] to help 
mergers of financial institutions burdened with nonperforming 
loans. 
  Ministry officials said the guidance is designed to help 
banking and nonbanking firms liquidate bad loans as quickly as 
possible to promote economic recovery. 
  Financial institutions were urged to actively utilize 
Cooperative Credit Purchasing Co. to rid themselves of bad loans 
or high-risk loans, the officials said. 
  The company is a joint venture established by about 150 
commercial banks and finance firms to liquidate bad loans. 
  The ministry also urged financial institutions to consider 
transferring claims for which they have agreed to reduce or 
exempt interest payments to affiliates. 
  The guidance will be incorporated in a comprehensive package 
of pump-priming measures to be announced by the government in 
the near future, the officials said.

  [Editorial Report] Tokyo Asahi Television Network in 
Japanese at 0207 GMT on 30 January, in its regularly-scheduled 
"Sunday Project" program, which begins at 0100 GMT, announces in 
a two-minute report the results of a nationwide telephone poll 
conducted earlier during the program. 
  Announcer Kayoko Miyata says that responses were obtained 
from 929 eligible voters. The number of respondents to each 
question is not given, however. All polling figures are as 
heard. 
  In the wake of the Diet's approval of the political reform 
bills, an unidentified poller earlier asked pollees several 
questions on their reactions toward the enactment of the bills, 
as well as their views on economic trends. In response to the 
first question, which asks whether the respondents support the 
Diet's approval of the political reform bills, 72.2 percent of 
pollees say "yes," 14.4 percent say "no," and 13.3 percent say 
they "do not know." On the same question, 68.6 percent of 
pollees who are supporters of the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan say "yes," 17.1 percent say "no," and 14.3 percent say 
they "do not know." 
  When the pollees are asked if they have become more 
confident 
about the nation's politics after observing the process of the 
debates on political reform, the largest group, 33.5 percent, 
says that their attitude toward politics "remains unchanged" 
even after the reform bills have been enacted. Moreover, 33.4 
percent say that their confidence in politics has been "damaged" 
through the process of debates. Only 17.9 percent say that they 
"became more confident about politics," while 8.9 percent say 
they "have no interest in politics," and 4.3 percent say they 
"do not know." 
  On a question which asks how the enactment of the bills is 
affecting the stagnant economy, 66 percent say that this "cannot 
boost the economy," and 26 percent say that it "might bring 
about some signs of an economic recovery." Only 3.7 percent say 
that this will "boost the economy," and 4 percent give other 
responses or the "do not know" answer. 
  Miyata next says that 76.9 percent of those polled expressed 
support for the Hosokawa cabinet. The report then ends.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- Three top Japanese 
contractors have pledged to the Construction Ministry that they 
will not engage in illegal bid-rigging for public works 
contracts, construction industry sources said Thursday [3 
February]. 
  The presidents of Kajima Corp., Taisei Corp. and Shimizu 
Corp. gave the pledge to the ministry by the end of January, the 
sources said. 
  The three leading contractors have also started personnel 
changes as part of their efforts to prove their commitment to 
the pledge, the sources said. 
  A series of recent bribery scandals involving the nation's 
construction industry has led to the arrest of a number of 
senior executives of building firms, including former Kajima 
Vice President Shinji Kiyoyama. 
  Kiyoyama, who was indicted on charges of giving a 20 million 
yen bribe to former Ibaraki Gov. Fujio Takeuchi, was reportedly 
at the center of collusive bidding involving major contractors. 
  On January 25, Taisei decided at a meeting of its executive 
board to transfer Kanji Hayama from the post of sales manager to 
a position in charge of technology. The sources said Taisei's 
sales manager was previously often involved in dealing with 
other companies about price-fixing arrangements. 
  Shimizu, meanwhile, decided on January 28 on large-scale 
personnel changes and organizational reform for strengthening 
its inspection system, while Kajima is expected to decide 
personnel changes by the middle of this month, the sources said. 
  The moves come as the Construction Ministry plans to 
introduce a new open bidding system for public works projects in 
April.

  [Text] Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, says 
everyone will benefit from the lifting of America's embargo on 
Vietnam. Senator Evans says Australia has been pushing 
President Clinton and his administration on the issue: 
  [Begin Evans recording] We have been urging him and previous 
administrations to go down this route, of course, for a very 
long time. We have regarded it as, quite frankly, absurd that 
the POW-MIA issue should have occupied the time and attention 
and been the distraction that it was. Obviously it is in 
everyone's interest that there be a resumption of major economic 
activity in Vietnam, and we are very glad that has happened. 
[end recording] 
  Sen. Evans said Australian industry should not fear American 
competition in Vietnam, because it should generate higher 
economic activity. The foreign minister said Australian 
industry was much more internationally competitive and Australia 
already had an established track record in Vietnam. 
  Belinda Tromp reports that the American decision is expected 
to remove some obstacles for Australian investors: 
  [Begin recording] [Tromp] With a literacy rate of around 80 
percent and a government keen to achieve rapid economic growth, 
Vietnam has some of the fundamentals for attracting new 
investment. What is missing, according to an executive member 
of the Australia-Vietnam Business Council, Robert Wilcox, is a 
modern bureaucracy. 
  [Wilcox] The Vietnamese need to move, I believe, more 
quickly 
with their reforms -- in getting their legal system together, 
getting their administrative act together -- as a result of this. 
  [Tromp] Mr. Wilcox says the reputation and expertise 
established by Australian companies already in Vietnam -- such 
as BHP, Telecom, and the ANZ Bank -- put Australian companies in 
a good position for the onset of competition from U.S. 
investors. [end recording]

  [Text] CANBERRA, Feb 7 (AFP) -- Australian Foreign Minister 
Gareth Evans said Monday the mortar-bomb attack on Sarajevo 
makes the option of air strikes against Bosnian Serb forces more 
compelling and irresistible. He described the bombing as a 
"despicable and barbaric act," adding that while the authorities 
were unable to positively establish responsibility, it was 
internationally assumed Bosnian Serb artillery was to blame. 
  "Certainly the case for air strikes is becoming more 
compelling, more irresistible," he told parliament. He said the 
international community was hesitant to use air strikes because 
it was unclear if they would be successful in removing threats 
and could hurt humanitarian operations in Bosnia. "It is a 
matter for very fine judgment for those who have their own 
citizens at risk," he said. 
  "It is a matter for very fine judgment by everyone who has 
the best interests of the Bosnian people deeply at heart. 
  "We in Australia will support any decision that is made as a 
result of these proper processes working themselves out."

announcer] 
  [Excerpts] Dear fraternal soldiers of the two-headed 
government: 
  1. Did you know that on 5 February, Long Sopheap ordered 
his henchmen to kill 23 soldiers who refused to enter the 
battlefields around Anlung Veng. [passage omitted] 
  2. This barbarous killing shows that the Vietnamese 
communists, their allies, and Vietnamese communist puppets are 
very fascist and have always been fascist towards the people, 
their troops, and the Para soldiers. 
  3. For this reason, for your own survival and in order to 
protect your parents, you should turn your guns at and shoot 
Long Sopheap and his henchmen. 
  You know well that Long Sopheap is not a Cambodian. He is a 
Vietnamese. He has forcibly recruited many people's sons to 
fight and die in his place. Moreover, Long Sopheap is very 
fascist and cruel. He shot dead several hundred of the soldiers 
of the two-headed government on the battlefields. [passage 
omitted]

  [Excerpt] This is a report on the National Army of 
Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] and the people routing the second 
military operation launched by troops of the Vietnamese 
communist puppets and two-headed government at Anlung Veng. 
  1. At the end of January, the Vietnamese communist puppets 
and two-headed government which oppose national reconciliation 
and the five-point advice of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk 
mobilized a large number of troops, tanks, armored personnel 
carriers, and war materiel to launch an offensive in the 
direction of Anlung Veng. But the NADK and Cambodian people 
routed this large-scale military operation on 31 January. 
  As a result, the NADK and people killed or wounded over 100 
troops of the Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed 
government, captured seven tanks, and destroyed 36 military 
trucks and armored personnel carriers. 
  2. The party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] as well as the 
Cambodian nation and people have drawn many experiences in 
dealing with enemies, old or new. That is, whether they are 
old or new enemies, they will always make another attempt after 
suffering a defeat. 
  As a matter of fact, on 3 and 4 February, the Vietnamese 
communist puppets and two-headed government mobilized another 
batch of 3,000 troops consisting mostly of routed troops from 
the 286th Division, 4th Military Zone, Kompong Thom Provincial 
unit; 5th Division; 41st and 43d Independent Regiments of the 
Vietnamese communist puppets; and Para forces, including those 
from ANKI [National Army of Independent Cambodia] and other Para 
groups from the 11th, 9th, and 3d Divisions and from the new 7th 
and 8th Divisions. All these infantrymen were escorted by many 
military trucks, tanks, armored personnel carriers, artillery, 
and multiple rocket launchers. 
  This second large-scale military operation launched under 
the 
direct command of Ke Kimyan, Pol Saroeun, Long Sopheap, Prum 
Samen, and Keo Pisit, who are star-spangled Army chiefs, and a 
number of other generals with second-hand stars was aimed at 
pushing into Anlung Veng once again. These high-ranking 
officers directly commanded the offensive because the two-headed 
government's troops from both the Vietnamese communist puppets' 
group and American-supported forces were ordered by the 
Vietnamese communists and their allies and the two-headed 
government that they must overtake Anlung Veng. 
  Their slogan is to mobilize tanks, artillery, and troops to 
launch a blitz and then take pictures of Anlung Veng for use in 
their propaganda in the international arena. They told their 
troops to attack and withdraw at once and open the way (?to move 
backward). 
  3. On 3 and 4 February, the attacking forces of the 
Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed government began 
their second offensive on Anlung Veng. 
  The NADK and Cambodian people prepared to welcome the 
criminal aggressors in advance. As soon as they arrived, the 
NADK and people immediately attacked and smashed them for the 
second time. 
  As a result of the attack and routing of this second 
military 
offensive, the NADK and Cambodian people destroyed four tanks 
and a multiple rocket launcher, killing or wounding over 300 
troops of the Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed 
government, and totally smashing the command headquarters of 
Prum Samen, Long Sopheap, and Keo Pisit. Moreover, the hundreds 
of Vietnamese communist puppet, ANKI, and other Para soldiers 
who have continued deserting the battlefield in groups for fear 
of the combat, malaria, and especially being unable to endure 
the shortage of food, water, and medicine and their daily 
exposure to the sun and the dew have fled in the direction of 
Route 68 and Siem Reap Province. Most of those deserters were 
very weary and could hardly walk. Some others dropped dead as 
soon as they reached Route 68 and Siem Reap. [passage omitted]

Phnom Penh on (?5) February] 
  [Text] We, Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech 
Hun Sen -- respectively first and second prime ministers of the 
Kingdom of Cambodia -- wish to state that a valuable time has 
arrived for all of you, the officers and rank and file of the 
Democratic Kampuchea [DK] faction. As you are already aware, 
the Khmer Royal Armed Forces [KRAF] have vigorously attacked and 
utterly destroyed important DK positions in the Anlung Veng, 
Siem Reap-Oddar Meanchey, Preah Vihear, Kompong Thom, and 
Banteay Meanchey regions, and have completely seized the command 
posts, hospitals, war materiel, and [word indistinct]. In 
addition, a number of DK officers and rank and file have 
deserted their ranks and either rallied to the Khmer Royal Armed 
Forces or returned to the national community, bringing along a 
significant quantity of documents, armaments, ammunition, and 
mines. 
  In view of this, the Royal Government of Cambodia wishes 
once 
again to appeal to all DK officers and soldiers -- especially 
those in the Anlung Veng and Preah Vihear regions and in the 
northwest -- to return quickly to the national community as good 
Cambodian citizens. You are urged to contact any KRAF unit or 
the royal administration. You will be enthusiastically welcomed 
by units and officials at all levels.

  [Text] Our National Radio has just received a message of 
commendation from Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech 
Hun Sen, respectively first and second prime ministers of the 
Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] and co- commanders in chief 
of the Khmer Royal Armed Forces, to all KRAF units and civil 
servants who are currently pursuing the task of defending the 
people in the Siem Reap-Oddar Meanchey region. The full text of 
the message is as follows: 
  With reference to the recent brilliant victories, especially 
the recent capture of the Anlung Veng position -- which has cut 
off the key center for the disturbances, harassment, and 
insecurity caused by the Khmer Rouge, and which has again made 
the Siem Reap-Oddar Meanchey region stable and safe for the 
people to earn a living -- achieved by all of you, who are the 
KRAF's officers and troops, militiamen, policemen, and civil 
servants at all levels, and who are currently actively carrying 
out the task of defending the innocent people in the region of 
Siem Reap-Oddar Meanchey; 
  On behalf of the RGC and the KRAF co-command, we wish to 
most 
sincerely and warmly commend all of you for your heroism, which 
constitutes a fine model for the cause of defending the 
motherland and national security for the Cambodian children of 
future generations. We also wish to pay tribute to the souls of 
those who have courageously fallen on the battlefield. In 
addition, we wish to express our deepest condolences to the 
families of those who have died for this sublime cause. The 
great sacrifices made by those officers and the rank and file 
will be engraved in the golden pages of the national history. 
  We would also like to wish all of you who are receiving 
treatment in hospitals a speedy recovery so you can return 
quickly to your families and units. 
  May you enjoy the five blessings of Lord Buddha, namely, 
longevity, social prestige, happiness, strength, and 
enlightenment. 
  [Dated] Phnom Penh, 5 February 1994

between FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, 
Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] and CPP [Cambodian 
People's Party]. 
  Hun Sen who met here on February 4 with Yosio Sakurauchi, 
member of the Japanese diet, said the two main parties,

and reconstructing of Cambodia. 
  With regard to national reconstruction and development, Hun 
Sen said there were four priorities -- agriculture, irrigation 
networks, communications, and professional training -- which 
need Japan's cooperation. 
  He also told the Japanese delegation that next month's visit 
of a delegation of the Royal Government of Cambodia to Japan 
would contribute of strengthening the ties of friendship between

  On investment, Hun Sen said the Khmer Rouge were not 
obstacles to investment in the country, adding that laws on 
investment have been worked out so as to facilitate foreign 
investors to invest in the Kingdom of Cambodia.

  [Text] France has reportedly provided the Vietnamese 
communist puppets' troops and the two-headed government with 30 
military trucks and a quantity of war materiel. National and 
international opinion maintains that the military aid given by 
France in this current situation means that the country 
continues openly to inflame the Vietnamese communist aggressors' 
war. The Cambodian nation and people vehemently oppose and 
resolutely condemn the French Government for its conspiracy with 
the Vietnamese communist aggressors, the Vietnamese communist 
puppets, and the unscrupulous alliance to further do away with 
the Cambodian nation, people, and race.

  [Text] Indonesia welcomes the decision by the U.S. 
Government to lift its trade embargo on Vietnam. A Foreign 
Ministry press statement stated that, even though the embargo is 
a bilateral problem of the two countries, the United States 
Government's lifting of the embargo was heartening because this 
would stimulate trade and economic activities among the various 
nations. Indonesia attaches great importance to efforts aimed 
at further enhancing regional political stability, security, and 
cooperation. As a result, any effort made to develop normal 
relations with any nation in this region represents a positive 
approach which will assist toward achieving such an aim.

<F P=106> ["Statement" issued by spokesman of the Foreign Affairs </F>
Ministry -- date not given; read by announcer] 
  [Text] In late January, the Senate of the United States 
discussed the issue of the lifting of the trade embargo against 
Vietnam. Following the discussion, the Senate overwhelmingly 
voted in favor of the lifting of the trade embargo. Later, on 3 
February 1994, President Bill Clinton officially announced his 
decision to lift the U.S. trade embargo against Vietnam. 
  The Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR], as a 
neighboring 
country which has shared the same difficult destiny as Vietnam, 
is delighted with this pleasant news and would like to sincerely 
welcome President Bill Clinton's decision. The government and 
people of Laos are of the view that this decision conforms to 
the regional trend and the current global situation, and meets 
the aspirations of the Vietnamese and the American peoples as 
well as the peoples of the entire Southeast Asian region. 
  Though the lifting of the trade embargo marks a significant 
step toward trade cooperation and exchanges of visits between 
Vietnam and the United States, the step which is widely 
acclaimed by peace- and justice-loving people in the world -- 
the normalization of relations between the two countries -- 
still remains to be taken. In view of this, the LPDR Government 
hopes that the lifting of the trade embargo will serve as a 
significant development toward enabling the relations between 
the two countries to advance toward normalization at an early 
date.

  [Text] On 1 February, the Central Committee of the Lao 
People's Revolutionary Party [LPRP] sent a telegram of 
congratulations to the Central Committee of the Communist Party 
of Vietnam [CPV] in Hanoi. The message reads: 
  On the occasion of the 64th anniversary of the establishment 
of the Communist Party of Vietnam, the LPRP Central Committee, 
on behalf of party members and multiethnic Lao people, would 
like to extend warmest greetings and best wishes to the CPV 
Central Committee, party members, and all fraternal Vietnamese 
people. 
  Since the inception of the CPV, which was founded, trained, 
and molded by the great Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the party has led 
the Vietnamese people to courageously carry out struggles and 
create excellent heroic deeds of great historical significance 
to conquer imperialist aggressors. As a result, it absolutely 
liberated the nation and led the whole country to advance on the 
socialist path. In the recent years, under the correct 
leadership of the CPV, the Vietnamese people have significantly 
enhanced the traditions of extreme patriotism and endeavors and 
initiatives to successfully and firmly protect the fruits of 
revolution. Besides, they have also attained very important 
basic achievements in the cause of comprehensive renovation. 
This has helped the national economy to enjoy the new firm 
steps of development. The living conditions, both in material 
and cultural aspects, of the people have noticeably been 
improved. The role and prestige of the Socialist Republic of 
Vietnam has been endlessly elevated in the international arena. 
  The LPDR and Lao people are very pleased with and would like 
to wholeheartedly congratulate on such great achievements of the 
CPV and fraternal Vietnamese people. Your glorious successes 
have vigorously boosted the morale of the Lao people who have 
also carried out the restructuring tasks too. 
  We would like to take this auspicious opportunity to wish 
the 
fraternal Vietnamese people under the leadership of the CPV, 
which is headed by respected and beloved Comrade General 
Secretary Do Muoi, to attain new and greater achievements in 
implementing the resolutions of the seventh party congress and 
the guidelines set by the party's recent meeting of 
representatives from all parts of the country. We wish you all 
continue to fulfill tasks of all-around renovation and advance 
firmly to steadily bring to the SRV progress and prosperity. 
  We are delighted to see that our two parties, which are of 
the same origin, have assisted each other sincerely and steadily 
over the past years. On this honorable and glorious occasion of 
the founding anniversary of the CPV, the LPRP Central Committee, 
on behalf of the entire party and Lao people, would like to 
express profound gratitude to the CPV and fraternal Vietnamese 
people for having always rendered invaluable support and 
assistance to the revolutionary tasks of Lao people. 
  May the great spirit of friendship, special solidarity, and 
all-around cooperation between the two parties, countries, and 
peoples of Laos and Vietnam last and flourish forever.

<F P=106> [Joint news conference by President Fidel Ramos and </F>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamed with Filipino and 
Malaysian correspondents at Malacanang Palace in Manila on 3 
February -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Ramos] Your excellency, Prime Minister Datuk 
Sri Dr. Mahathir, ladies and gentlemen of the media, our 
coworkers in government. 
  I am delighted to welcome Your Excellency Datuk Sri Dr. 
Mahathir Mohamed, the prime minister of Malaysia, and his 
delegation to the Philippines. I welcome you as the leader of 
an Asian partner and neighbor, the first Malaysian head of 
government to make an official visit to our country since the 
foundation of Malaysia. [passage omitted] 
  In the year since my journey to Kuala Lumpur, many visits 
have been exchanged by others from our two countries. In some 
cases, the Malaysian businessmen's search for trade and 
investment opportunities has already born fruit for both sides 
in the form of substantial investments made in the Philippines, 
including a major tourist facility in Subic. 
  A few minutes ago, we witnessed the signing of various joint 
venture agreements, including agreements in the critical areas 
of water supply, banking, and tourism. 
  We are indeed gratified by the presence of the prime 
minister's delegation of more than 80 top Malaysian businessmen. 
  Malaysia Airlines has begun flying between Kota Kinabalu and 
Cebu. Philippine Airlines has opened a regular flight between 
Zamboanga City and Labuan. 
  Meanwhile, our officials are making satisfactory progress in 
their work on a bilateral investment guarantee agreement. The 
joint commission which Prime Minister Mahathir and I agreed to 
establish held its first meeting in Manila last December with 
results covering an extensive range of areas of cooperation that 
are of great importance for both countries. [passage omitted] 
  In our talks this afternoon, Prime Minister Mahathir and I 
reiterated our commitment to the establishment of East ASEAN 
Growth Area or EAGA among Mindanao, East Malaysia, Eastern 
Indonesia, and Brunei Darussalam. The EAGA will tie together 
those regions that are contiguous to one another through direct 
transportation and communication links, the sharing of 
facilities, the joint marshalling of complimentary resources, 
the [words indistinct] for goods, services, and persons, and 
networks of officials, institutions, and a wide variety of 
sectors. 
  We agreed on the early convening of the joint committee on 
border cooperation to greatly facilitate as well more 
effectively regulate the movement of goods and people across our 
border. 
  We discussed the situation of the Filipino migrants in Sabah 
and of the Filipino workers in peninsular Malaysia. 
  Prime Minister Mahathir reiterated his invitation to the 
Philippines to send trade and investment missions to Malaysia 
[words indistinct] and provide information on Philippine 
products and investment opportunities to Malaysia's business 
community. He stressed Malaysia's particular interest in joint 
ventures, including infrastructure development, joint air 
services, and the privatization of government enterprises. 
  We agreed to deepen our cooperation in the judicious 
development of our aquatic and forest resources and help each 
other in the research of technology needed in these areas of 
complimentary expertise. 
  We are determined to cooperate in carrying out the intent of 
spirit of the 1992 Manila Declaration of the South China Sea 
both bilaterally and with our other neighbors, particularly in 
the peaceful solution of the dispute over the area and enjoy 
scientific and economic endeavors there. 
  We renewed our commitment to the realization of the ASEAN 
Free Trade Area or AFTA, and the early launching of the East 
Asian Economic Caucus or EAEC, a concept that arose from Dr. 
Mahathir's statesmanly vision, a proposal which we fully 
support. [passage omitted] 
  [Moderator] His Excellency Dr. Mohamed Mahathir [Mahathir 
Mohamed], prime minister of Malaysia. We invite you to speak. 
  [Mahathir] [passage omitted] As is known, we have certain 
problems and as a result of these problems, there have not been 
many official visits on the part of either Malaysian or 
Philippine high officials and members of the governments to each 
other's country. I really feel that this kind of relationship 
has gone on long enough and that we should look into ways and 
means of cooperating while we try to resolve the problems that 
we have between ourselves. 
  And that is, Malaysia assures that we should renew cordial 
relations with the Philippines, and we should make visits to 
each other's country, as well as discuss the issues with a view 
of cooperating with each other. 
  During the visit of President Ramos last year, we reached a 
number of agreements on the approach and method of cooperating 
between the two countries. As a result, there has been many 
tangible results, in that, there have been a number of joint 
ventures and investments on the part of Malaysians in the 
Philippines. And we hope that trade between Philippines and 
Malaysia has picked up, although of course, we are in similar 
environment. As you see, the Philippines has purchased oil from 
Malaysia. 
  We hope that we can reduce this imbalance by promoting more 
Philippine goods in Malaysia, and this can be done through a 
division in the promotion in Malaysia of Philippine-made 
manufactured products. At the same time, we feel that we can 
tackle in developing the growth area involving not just the 
Philippines and Malaysia, but also Brunei and Indonesia -- all 
of which are permanent members of ASEAN. 
  I will widely work on this idea in the four countries. We 
feel that we should work on and cooperate on bilateral relations 
first. And this cooperation should be in the area of 
communications, tourism, etcetera, and fishery. 
  There are very many potentials in these areas. This will 
lead 
us to an invariable need to get to feel and witness the changes 
that have taken place mainly, particularly, under the presidency 
of President Ramos. And using the atmosphere that is just right 
for greater economic cooperation and cooperation in other fields 
between Malaysia and the Philippines. 
  We have begun ministerial level meetings between the two 
countries and we need to meet more often, and that includes of 
course the president of the Philippines and the prime minister 
of Malaysia. And on every opportunity that we have, whether in 
our country or at international gatherings, we should make it a 
point to see each other and to renew our personal relations and 
friendship. Also, we will discuss bilateral issues. I think we 
have made very good progress towards normalizing relations 
between the two countries, and I hope that in the proper time, 
we will be able to resolve whatever problems that there may be 
between Malaysia and the Philippines. So, that is all that I 
have to say, and I shall be prepared to answer any questions 
that you may ask. Thank you very much. 
  [Moderator] Before asking the question, will you kindly 
state 
your name and your agency. 
  [Ely Tordesillas of MALAYA] I'd like to address this 
question 
to His Excellency the prime minister of Malaysia. A few months 
ago, the APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] meeting held 
in Seattle witnessed the gathering of twelve leaders. Was your 
reason for shying away from the Blake Island meeting relevant 
and valid up to this day? What were your reservations about the 
direction APEC is taking? 
  [Mahathir] Well, right from the beginning, we felt that APEC 
should not be a formal organization. It should be a forum for 
its 15-member countries to exchange ideas and to formulate 
programs, particularly programs which can be helpful to those 
members, that are developing countries. Of course, this has 
been done but we think that more should be done. However, the 
trend now is that it is a much more formal organization complete 
with secretaries and meetings of heads of government. We are 
not yet convinced that this is what we should be doing. And 
secondly, we, in Malaysia feel that APEC should not be used in 
any way to balance the (political) problems here between America 
and Europe. We are not amenable for that kind of view. We 
would like ourselves be caught free from any political problems 
that may be formulated by APEC. And it is because of this that 
we have not been (?imbued) to the ideas that formalizing and 
having regular meetings of heads of government of APEC. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Ahmad from (words indistinct) of Malaysia] I would like to 
address this question to President Ramos. What kind of 
incentives would the Philippines be giving to Malaysian 
investors in the future especially in the promotion of the EAGA. 
Thank you. 
  [Ramos] We have two kinds of investment (?categories) 
generally. And these are, first, we have export processing 
zones, and there are many incentives of Transfer EPZA [Export 
Processing Zone Authority], as we call it. Still of the same 
kind, the special economic zones and free ports of which the 
latest versions are those in Subic, and in Clark. Special 
economic zones are within a free port, and therefore, generally, 
the goods that enter into that free port area for processing and 
then later [word indistinct] coming duty-free, it did not 
normally go back into the local economy. We have also 
completely liberalized the various transactions involving 
foreign exchange which is good for the whole country, but this 
is another advantage here in the Philippines for investors. In 
the other kind which is outside these special zones and free 
ports, we do allow the possession of real estate that is within 
a developed or investment area for as long as 75 years. There 
are certain tax incentives and tax advantages and tax holidays 
given to our investors that invest in these areas that are 
outside our processing zones and the special economic areas. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Teddy Abanot of PTV 4] I would like to ask the president 
and the prime minister regarding their view of regional security 
in the ASEAN prompting the resolution of the Spratly issue at 
this time. 
  [Ramos] On the part of the Philippines, our policy within 
ASEAN as well as with our neighbors in the Asia-Pacific has 
always been one of cooperation. In this area we are not siding 
with any particular country in a formal defense or military pact 
except for the existing 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty with the 
United States. This is one of three military treaties with the 
United States, two of which we have already phased out. Our new 
policy on the part of the Philippines is that we must enhance 
our cooperation in the defense field by way of high level 
exchanges among our officials and officers in the defense 
department of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. 
  We cooperate also very comprehensively in regard to the 
training and schooling of our officers at various levels and we 
exchange information of mutual benefit among the countries in 
this region on a regional as well as a bilateral basis. We 
feel, however, on the part of the Philippines, that more than 
military alliances, the security, and therefore the stability of 
our part of the world will come more from economic 
interdependence, from mutual support in our economic endeavors. 
And at the bottom line, it will be our sustained progress that 
will ensure for the nations in this region a greater degree of 
stability and security. 
  [Mahathir] What I would like to add is the promotion of 
ASEAN. ASEAN was formed because we are a group or part of each 
other and if it is your time to discuss this problem, well the 
likelihood is that you would confront each other. But while we 
have ASEAN, let's sit down and talk and discuss the problems 
including security problems. [passage omitted] 
  I am honestly saying that security problems can be resolved 
by not resorting to harms and having powerful navies and armies 
in the region to protect us. We didn't see who is going to be 
our enemies. One of the things we believe in is, if you say such 
and such country is going to be your enemy in the future, then 
they will be your enemy now, and that is where it will put us at 
a loss. So we would rather say that they are our friends. And 
when you look around us, we see friends, so we won't be immersed 
to worry about security that much. 
  It is the other people out there who's thinking of harping 
on 
the question of security, implying that there is arms struggle 
forth around here. This is one thing to conquer us, that is, 
out of discontent because countries don't conquer anymore, but 
this is overt dream to conquer. 
  The other thing is that, one of the reasons for the feeling 
of insecurity is the fact that they have nothing else to think 
of. For example, if a country is very poor, then it may think of 
invading another country in order to get the wealth of another 
country. But if countries have prospered, they have invested 
into it to see that there is stability in the region. So that 
they continue with their economic expansion as well as trade. 
And we believe that if the whole of this region can become 
prosperous, then we would all have invested into it to maintain 
stability and peace without resorting to war. Just the fact 
that we need stability in order to trade would make us very much 
aware of the need to avoid conflict. And I think this is 
happening in Southeast Asia and in East Asia. [passage omitted] 
  Our experience with the Japanese is that they invested in 
Malaysia and their investments has enabled Malaysia to prosper. 
And because we are more prosperous now, we are buying a lot of 
Japanese goods. So the Japanese are getting the return of their 
investment more than just the profits from their investments. 
  But then, if we are not stable, then, they won't get returns 
for their investment. So, when we invest in other countries, we 
hope that their countries will become prosperous. And because 
they are prosperous, they will have vested interests and see to 
it that there is no war, no conflict, that peace is maintained. 
And because there is what is good for them, so, I don't think 
we need to resort to inviting the navies and armies from other 
parts of the world to come and defend us. And we feel that 
sometimes if it is not in their interest, they don't defend you. 
  [Abanot] Just a point of clarification from the president 
and the prime minister. It's been over a year that you got the 
Manila Declaration regarding the resolution of the Spratly 
issue. Are all the countries involved now making a timetable in 
resolving this once and for all? 
  [Ramos] [passage omitted] In our bilateral meeting today, we 
reaffirm our commitment -- the Philippines and Malaysia -- to 
that policy of a peaceful approach to the solution of any 
disputes in the South China Sea. And one of the major steps 
taken, which I consider to be a step forward, is to get our 
fisheries technical people to continue meeting -- because we 
have already started meeting -- so that we can work out some 
sort of a fisheries agreement between Malaysia and the 
Philippines. And our fishermen can jointly fish in the area for 
the benefit of both countries. 
  To further extend the idea of cooperation in fishing 
activities, Malaysia and the Philippines will look for other 
possible areas for fishing and food processing cooperation 
outside of the Spratly Island area. This kind of approach, in 
fact, is what will be used for other areas in which there are 
border problems. And it will also be the guiding principles 
behind our proposed border-crossing agreement, which is now 
under consideration of our joint Philippine-Malaysian 
commission. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] As expected, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir 
bin Mohamed will not pass the chance of holding a dialogue with 
key Philippine legislators on the single, most burning issue 
that preoccupies Philippine-Malaysian relations: the dispute 
over Sabah. 
  Foreign Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino said the dispute 
would in no way be the focus of Mahathir's visit this week, but 
he pointed out that "the air could be cleared to some extent and 
things clarified" with the Malaysian leader's meeting with 
members of the Philippine Congress. 
  It is just as well. Although the executive since the time of 
former President Corazon C. Aquino has made moves to drop the 
Sabah claim to improve our relations with Malaysia, opposition 
by senators has consistently stood in the way. [passage omitted] 
  Mahathir has since said that he understands the peculiarity 
of the Philippine system, declaring that certain processes have 
to be followed before Manila could relinquish its claim to Sabah. 
  The Sabah issue, therefore, represents just about the 
exception in the traditional dictum that foreign policy is 
formulated by the executive. The issue is an emotional one and 
cannot be resolved by mere executive fiat. But more than that, 
the Sabah issue represents the challenge facing the Philippine 
government system on one hand, and Philippine-Malaysian 
relations on the other. Since the Senate has insisted on 
becoming a partner with Malacanang [presidential office] in 
setting the foreign-policy agenda at least in so far as the 
Sabah issue is concerned, it is compelled to define a 
far-reaching but workable stand to resolve the thorniest problem 
plaguing our relations with Malaysia. Prolonged opposition by 
lawmakers to executive initiatives to drop the claim without any 
initiative on their part to make practical proposals will 
inevitably be construed as nothing but obstructionism. In 
short, the issue is a challenge to Philippine democratic 
consensus-building. [passage omitted] 
  To be sure, the exchange visit of Mr. Mahathir will show 
that 
Philippine-Malaysian relations have matured. It signals the 
desire of Malaysia to continue on the path of regional 
solidarity and cooperation. The grand vision of ASEAN appears 
secure and cannot be derailed by territorial disputes. Like 
France and Germany, the Philippines and Malaysia have managed to 
build a strong partnership in spite of pending historical 
claims. [passage omitted] 
  It is up to our legislators to show to the Malaysian leader 
that their opposition to dropping the Sabah claim at this time 
upholds the national interest, an aspect of which is fostering 
better relations with Malaysia. The dialogue perhaps will make 
tentative steps toward resolving the dispute once and for all in 
a peaceful and mutually beneficial manner. If so, the Sabah 
issue may yet instruct and impress the Malaysians on the glory 
of Philippine democracy.

  [Text] The country's domestic debt stock was placed at 
P656.59 billion [Philippine pesos] as of end-1993, more than 29 
percent the previous year. 
  Official statistics obtained yesterday showed end-December 
local debt was P148.312 billion over the P508.278 billion 
borrowed from local sources in 1992. 
  If the $34 billion foreign debt stock, roughly equivalent to 
P9.18 trillion, were added to the domestic liability, the total 
country indebtedness would reached a staggering P9.836 trillion. 
  Data indicated that bulk of the local liabilities, P624.181 
billion or 95.06 percent, was incurred by the national 
government. The balance was borrowed by government corporations 
amounting to P4.038 billion and P28.371 billion by the monetary 
institutions. On a month-on-month basis, though, borrowings of 
the government corporations as well as that of the monetary 
institutions dropped slightly by P14 million and P14.456 
billion, respectively. On the other hand, the national 
government's liabilities widened by a hefty P196.949 billion 
from the previous month's level of P427.232 billion. . 
  According to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) [Central 
Bank of the Philippines], expansion in the NG [national 
government] domestic debt stock was caused by its decision to 
absorb a substantial amount of liabilities of the old Central 
Bank through the issuance of the P220 billion worth of bonds to 
the BSP. The BSP said that an aggregate of P226.95 billion has 
already been inputted in the end-December liabilities. Of this 
amount P176.952 billion was in Treasury bills and P50 billion 
were Treasury notes. While the increment was substantially lower 
by P30 billion from the amount inputted to the national 
government liabilities in December, this amount was however, 
paid to the BSP for the advances it made for the national 
government in the past.

  [Text] Speaking to reporters at Government House this 
morning about the report on the terrorist responsible for the 
bombing of the U.S. World Trade Center hiding in Thailand, 
General Charan Kunlawanit, said that was the story presented by 
a news agency. However, the problem of terrorism seems to exist 
in all countries. Anyone who has information on this issue is 
requested to contact the authorities. Thai authorities are 
ready to conduct an investigation into the matter and arrest 
such a person. Thailand has been cooperating with foreign 
countries and agencies in the prevention and suppression of 
international terrorism.

  [Excerpts] Thailand and the United States will on 7 
February hold another round of negotiations on the signing of a 
double taxation treaty. More than 20 such talks were held 
before but failed to produce any success because the Finance 
Ministry, which is in charge of the country's taxation policy, 
considered the conditions proprosed by the U.S. side 
execessively disadvantageous to Thailand. 
  A source in the Finance Ministry noted that the outcome of 
this round of negotiations, which will last until 10 February, 
will be crucial to both countries because its success means the 
breakthrough of the over 16-year-long stalemate. 
  During his meeting with U.S. Secretary of Treasury Lloyd 
Bentsen on 18 January, Finance Minister Tharin Nimanhemin 
reaffirmed his endeavors to make the negotiations successful for 
the benefit of the the two countries' trade and investment. 
However, he stressed that the agreement must not put Thailand 
at a disadvantage. 
  However, this will be a tough job for Director General of 
Revenue Department M.R. Chatumongkhon Sonakun, who will conduct 
the negotiations with the U.S. side. He also knows full well 
that several U.S. demands were detrimental to Thai interests and 
caused failure of the past talks. 
  In addition to that, the United States itself is also 
influenced by pressure from various interest groups and thus has 
to carefully consider the impact on them. Otherwise, the U.S. 
Government will face assults from professional lobbyists of 
these groups. [passage omitted] 
  A source said: "Our estimation of the percentage of success 
for this round of negotiations is very low because the 
conditions proposed by the United States are too disadvantageous 
to Thailand. It is unlikely that the United States will adopt a 
compromising stand during the talks. Although Bentsen said when 
he came here that efforts would be made to ensure flexibility, 
the U.S. side will attach more importance to the interests of 
their people. If we yield to some of their demands, we will be 
in a disadvantageous position. In short, it is very likely that 
no agreement can be reached this time."

  [Text] A Finance Ministry source has disclosed that there 
are four major issues likely to cause the failure of the 
Thai-U.S. negotiations on avoiding double taxation, scheduled to 
begin today. 
  He said the first obstacle is whether or not the definition 
of royalties should cover intellectual property rights and other 
rights, as well as fixing appropriate tax rates. 
  Second is whether or not the definition of air and sea 
transportation services covers other activities, such as sea and 
air charters, as well as determining their tax exemption. 
  Third is what types of activities should be included in 
the definition of a "permanent establishment." 
  Fourth is the problem of fixing an appropriate tax rate 
for interest earnings. There is a wide gap between the two 
countries' tax rates. Thailand collects 15 percent of the 
interest earnings of banks, while the United States charges 30 
percent. 
  Revenue Department Director General M.R. Chatumongkhon 
Sonakun has disclosed that 19 issues will be brought up for 
discussion during the negotiations. He anticipates encountering 
more difficulties in these negotiations than with the other 
countries that want to amend their treaties with Thailand on 
avoiding double taxation. This is because there are many 
interest groups involved, and they are openly lobbying their 
government. The director general said: "The major obstacle to 
the Thai-U.S. negotiations, which have been dragging on for many 
years, is that many lobbyists have been pressuring the 
politicians. If this round of negotiations is unsuccessful, it 
will be postponed until next year. Still, I am not sure that 
the two sides will be able to reach any agreement." 
  The director general noted that Thailand is at a 
disadvantage 
in this round of negotiations because it is a smaller country 
and its exports to the United States account for 25 percent of 
its total exports. In addition, the United States imposes a 
mere 1 percent tax on Thai imports, which is minimal when 
compared with other countries. For this reason, the United 
States may show leniency toward some of the Thai side's requests. 
  The director general stressed that the government attaches 
great significance to this round of negotiations. Everyone 
hopes that it will succeed and be equitable and fair to both 
sides. He said: "That is why the talks will take three full 
days -- from today until 10 February. This is longer than 
similar talks we have held with other countries."

  [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday received 
from Washington yesterday a report on the lifting of the U.S. 
trade embargo against Vietnam. President Bill Clinton made the 
decision after the U.S. Senate on 28 January voted 62 against 38 
for the abrogation of the law on a trade embargo against 
Vietnam. The lifting of the U.S. embargo can be regard as the 
opening of the door to the world market for Vietnam because the 
trade boycott created numerous obstacles to trade and investment 
development in that country. As a result, not only Vietnam but 
also all countries, including the U.S. private sectors, will 
benefit from this new move for they will be able to do business 
in Vietnam, which is one of the markets and investment areas in 
the Asia and Pacific region that is of high potential. 
  As a close neighboring country of Vietnam, Thailand is 
extremely pleased with the U.S. president's decision and regards 
it as ending the past conflict and beginning a period of peace 
and economic development in Indochina and the Southeast Asian 
region. 
  Speaking to reporters during an interview right after 
learning about the report at Government House yesterday, Deputy 
Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan said: 
  [Begin Amnuai recording] Not only the United States but also 
other countries will invest in Vietnam because the process of 
economic development is currently being carried out with the 
cooperation of several countries in line with the so-called 
globalization system. For this reason, all countries, including 
Thailand, will benefit from the lifting of the embargo. We will 
have to closely monitor this new development. Our 
entrepreneurs, business people, and industrialists should render 
their cooperation because they can also share in the benefit 
along with Vietnam and other countries. [end recording] 
  Asked about the anticipated increase of Thai investment in 
Vietnam, the deputy prime minister said: 
  [Begin Amunai recording] There is nothing wrong with this if 
it is for mutual interests. If we have the resources, we can 
form joint investment ventures with them. This is a common 
practice because all the parties concerned will gain. 
Meanwhile, it does not mean that we will not invest in our own 
country. In fact, Thailand's economy is much more advanced than 
theirs. Our market is big and wide. We have the buying power. 
Nobody wants to turn away from Thailand. Provided we manage 
our economy properly, our market will continue to expand 
rapidly. This new development will benefit our region, 
particularly in the areas of international security and 
political stability. [end recording]

  [Text] Deputy Commerce Minister Chaloemphon Sanitwongchai 
said during an interview with newsmen in Udon Thani Province 
that Thailand will certainly feel the impact from the lifting of 
the U.S. trade embargo on Vietnam. Vietnam is quick to adjust 
and therefore likely to catch up with Thailand within five years 
despite the fact that Vietnam now is 20 years behind Thailand. 
He said the Vietnamese people are very diligent by nature. 
Vietnam is a big competitor of Thailand in rice exports, but 
the quality of Vietnam's rice is still lower than Thai rice. 
Thailand, he said, must try to improve the quality of its rice 
export, especially in terms of packaging.

  [Excerpts] The Thai Government yesterday welcomed the 
lifting of the US embargo against Vietnam as an opportunity for 
both countries to grow economically. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak said the move 
will be to the advantage of both Vietnam and Thailand. It will 
be a catalyst in the development of Vietnam, as more investors 
will go in, but it will be for Vietnam to amend its existing 
laws and regulations to tempt investors, he said. The transfer 
of funds will become more convenient, and the Mekhong Sub-region 
Project will benefit as Vietnam will be encouraged to take part, 
he said. Suphachai assured Thai investors that Vietnam will not 
become a competitor because Thailand is several steps ahead of 
Vietnam in manufacturing. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan commented that he does 
not expect Vietnam to represent a serious threat to Thai rice 
exports to the US as a result of the move. The US imports Thai 
glutinous rice because there are many Asians living there, and 
normally the US does not import rice from any country because of 
its rice surplus. Amnuai said Thailand's strong economic growth 
will prevent a significant shift of foreign investment away from 
Thailand to Vietnam. "Nobody will abandon Thailand for 
Vietnam," he said. "What we should worry about is how to manage 
and control our strong growth." 
  Government spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa said that Thailand 
as one of the main gateways to Indochina stands to benefit from 
increased trade and regional investment. "The lifting of the 
embargo will stimulate trade and investment in the region," 
Abpisit told UPI. "It is positive development for Thailand." 
But the lifting of the embargo will eliminate the necessity to 
trans-ship products through Thailand to Vietnam. "Definitely it 
will affect certain kinds of Thai businesses," Aphisit said. 
"Some will benefit from this and some will lose. We have to 
accept the (Vietnamese) competition." [passage omitted] 
  Kroekkrai Chiraphaet, Director-General of the Business 
Economics Department, said the move will mean keener competition 
for Thailand. "Vietnam may take three to five years to catch up 
with us, especially in products such as textiles, shoes, 
electronics, computer components and electrical appliances, he 
said. But it does not take long to establish factories and 
Vietnam has a comparative labour advantage, he said. Thailand's 
labour costs are moving up, therefore it should seek a 
comparative advantage in manufacturing quality. Thailand must 
catch up with Japan, Taiwan, Korea and Hong Kong and step away 
from competitors. The influx of investors to Vietnam implies 
that they want to gain a greater share of the local market, 
Kroekkrai said. 
  Due to its proximity to Vietnam, Thailand enjoys a decisive 
advantage in certain businesses such as construction materials 
and certain Thai consumer products. These have gained market 
recognition from being smuggled into Vietnam over the past two 
decades. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan yesterday 
hailed US President Bill Clinton's removal of 30-year old trade 
sanctions against Vietnam as a move that would benefit Thailand 
and the region. At the same time, Mr Surin acknowledged that the 
return of US business to Vietnam would have some repercussions 
on Thailand. He did not elaborate on the repercussions, but said 
they should serve to prompt Thais to "pay more attention' to 
economic developments in the region. "Thailand will benefit from 
economic development in Vietnam," he said. "The region is a free 
market. The emergence of Vietnam in the market system will 
enable the region to develop trade, investment and tourism 
ties," he said. 
  A Foreign Ministry statement said the removal of the US 
embargo would not only improve the "atmosphere" between the US 
and Vietnam but also foster economic development in Vietnam and 
the Southeast Asian region. 
  The Foreign Ministry's East Asia Department 
director-general, 
Don Pramutwinai, said better economic conditions expected to 
come with the removal of the US embargo are unlikely to lead to 
political liberalisation in Vietnam. It was a "matter of theory" 
that people enjoying better living standards would demand 
political freedom, he said. In reality, the situation in Vietnam 
was different because the Communist Party remained firmly in 
charge of the country, he said. The party recently made clear 
that it would retain the existing system, indicating that 
political and economic policies were working, he said. "If 
existing conditions in Vietnam are suitable for the country, why 
should they be changed?" But the future of communism in Vietnam 
depended on economic developments in the world at large and 
Vietnam's response to them, he said. Vietnamese people were 
unlikely to demand political change "because they have been 
under strict control," he said. Vietnam learned from 
pro-democracy protests in the Soviet Union and China where there 
were demands for political reform after economic improvements. 
  Demands for democracy and human rights in Vietnam were more 
likely to come from the United States, he said. "If the 
Americans don't make the demand, no one else will," he said. 
  Another official said that better economic conditions would 
improve Vietnam's access to the outside world, and this might 
lead to demand for change especially among Vietnamese in the 
southern part of the country. The southerners were previously in 
contact with the West and, with a better economy, might demand 
political change, he said. The official cited the pro-democracy 
demonstrations in Tienanmen Square in Peking in 1989. But he 
noted that Vietnam's Communist Party was "more hardline" than 
that of China and that it remained unpredictable how Hanoi would 
adjust to any demand for political change. 
  Deputy Foreign Ministry spokesman Rawi Hongpraphat said the 
removal of the US embargo would help ease tension in Southeast 
Asia. Economically, Lt [Lieutenant] Rawi warned that Thais would 
have to work harder because there would be competition in the 
cheaper labour market in Vietnam. 
  Another official pointed out that there would also be 
competition for Thailand in terms of US capital and technology. 
"Thai businessmen must work harder because other investors from 
the US have big money and high technology needed in Vietnam," 
the official said. "Our investors have the edge only in terms of 
experience in some, not many, sectors." The entry of US business 
into Vietnam would lead to more systematic economic development 
of the country, he said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Commenting on the lifting of U.S. economic sanctions 
against Vietnam, Prayun Thaloengsi, executive director of the 
Thailand Board of Trade, said that in the future Vietnam would 
become Thailand's competitor. Anyway, he said, Thai businessmen 
do not need to worry about Vietnam's development because 
Thailand is already on the road to development and is currently 
strengthening its system. 
  Prayun, who made his comments on 4 February, said that the 
lifting of the U.S. embargo would directly benefit Vietnam and 
would boost the climate for trade and investment in Vietnam. As 
for the United States, its businessmen will have direct access 
to investment in Vietnam. They will no longer have to conduct 
business half in the open and half in secret, as in the past. 
Vietnam will also benefit from the move in that it will now be 
able to seek foreign loans. Thailand, he said, can regard 
Vietnam as a new market, because Vietnam is shifting toward a 
market economy with the lifting of U.S. economic sanctions. 
Meanwhile, Vietnam will become Thailand's competitor in the 
future, especially in labor-intensive industries, because of the 
fact that labor is cheaper in Vietnam than in Thailand.

<F P=106> ["World Window" column by Thetthat] </F>
  [Excerpts] If everything went as planned, by now, on 
Friday in Washington D.C. (Saturday in Thailand), President Bill 
Clinton must already have announced a major decision to lift the 
trade sanctions imposed for 30 years on Vietnam, its adversary. 
  The decision of the U.S. leader will turn a new page in the 
history of relations between the United States and Vietnam, now 
free of conditions from the Indochina war. [passage omitted] 
  Those benefiting from the removal of the trade sanctions are 
none other than private American companies which, from now on, 
will be able to reap profits from Vietnam in full after allowing 
Japan to gain huge interests for so long. 
  The American business sector believed that the sanctions 
caused more damage to the United States than to Vietnam. It 
deprived the U.S. private sector of huge "business 
opportunities" during the 30 years of the sanctions. [passage 
omitted] In the eyes of American businessmen, Vietnam is no 
longer the enemy who killed more than 50,000 American GIs during 
the war. Vietnam of the "new era" for them is a country with 
high economic potential and the possibility of becoming another 
"new tiger in Asia." More importantly, Vietnam can serve as a 
"base" in the economic power play as a balance against China and 
Japan. [passage omitted] 
  However, experts on this matter do not think the United 
States will restore diplomatic relations with Vietnam as easily 
as it decided to lift the trade sanctions (which stood for 
economic commitments). 
  For the United States, the question of diplomatic relations 
with Hanoi must certainly be linked with the question of human 
rights, democracy development, and other conditions. Thus, it 
will take a long time before the two countries can establish 
full diplomatic relations. 
  As for President Clinton, he has once again demonstrated 
political `courage' despite the fact that he risked being 
opposed by war veterans. Yet the risk is worthwhile because he 
has gotten full support from the business and political sectors, 
especially from the rival Republican Party. With all the pros 
and cons taken into account, it can be said that the whole of 
the United States stands to gain from this action.

  [Text] Thai businessmen resident in Vietnam say the Thai 
Government and private sector should work hard together to turn 
Vietnam's post-embargo economy from a competitor into one that 
complements Thailand's growth. 
  The sale of construction materials and the opportunity to 
participate in construction contracts are among the most 
promising prospects arising from the expected influx of US 
companies after US President Bill Clinton announced on Thursday 
night he was lifting the trade embargo, they said. 
  "If we come up with well-thoughtout strategies on the part 
of 
both the Government and the private sector the revival of 
Vietnam can be turned into something complementing, instead of 
competing with, the Thai economy," Thotsathit Rotprasoet, 
manager of Thai Military Bank's Ho Chi Minh City branch, told 
BUSINESS POST. 
  The fact that Vietnam may soon be able to speed up 
rehabilitation of its war-ravaged infrastructure will boost 
demand for construction materials, and this presents a potential 
for growth in bilateral trade with Thailand, said Sinthon 
Kanthawong, the Thai Commercial Counsellor to Vietnam in Hanoi. 
  Vietnam's domestic cement production capacity is now four 
million tons, while the country's Ministry of Construction 
projects demand at 8-10 million tons. Both Mr Thotsathit and Mr 
Sinthon agreed that opportunities for Thai construction 
companies were very clear, either in subcontracting from giant 
multinationals or in supplying construction materials and heavy 
machinery. Thailand's location is certainly a plus, Mr Sinthon 
added. 
  "Thai products are in the quality and price ranges that fit 
the Vietnamese demand and purchasing power besides being in a 
geographically convenient location," he said. However, Thai 
companies wishing to invest or develop business opportunities in 
Vietnam will face tougher competition now with many other 
players entering the scene, especially the Americans and the 
Japanese, he noted. 
  Mr Thotsathit called on the Government to promote trade 
financing facilities in order to allow greater and easier trade 
in construction materials such as cement, asphalt, cranes and 
other heavy machinery. He also said it was high time the Thai 
Construction Contractors' Association moved into the Vietnamese 
market under the leadership of the Thai Government, in a 
systematic way. Such a movement has not yet taken place, he 
added. Mr Thotsathit said Thailand could help fill the gaps 
existing in Vietnam to create a complementary economy. "There 
is a reason to fear rivalry with Vietnam if the Thais are not 
well-prepared. But if we are well-prepared, the growth of 
Vietnamese economy can benefit the Thai economy, and this is 
already very clear with the construction sector." 
  Mr Sinthon agreed, saying that competltlon in the production 
and export of primary agricultural commodities is inevitable. 
"But for manufactured products such as motorbikes, electric 
appliances, consumer goods or semi-processed goods, Thailand can 
meet those rising demands in Vietnam," he added. Thailand has to 
take the competitiveness factor into consideration in the longer 
term but not the short term, he noted.

  [Excerpts] US President Bill Clinton's decision to lift a 
long-standing trade embargo against Vietnam had been expected. 
[passage omitted] 
  In his White House speech, Clinton said the time for 
bitterness was over and now was the time for a new beginning 
between Hanoi and Washington. This is indeed laudable and the 
US president could not have said it better. 
  The reconciliation process was a long difficult one for the 
United States due to the great bitterness the Vietnam War had 
caused among the American people. At that time it was perceived 
that a communist regime had beaten the free world superpower of 
the day, and this did not go down well with the American people. 
  When the embargo was extended after 1975, its purpose was to 
squeeze more information from Vietnam regarding the American 
MiAs. [missing in action] Veterans groups and families of the 
MiAs were of course very emotionally involved, just wanting to 
know what happened to their loved ones. 
  Hence there was a great deal of pressure on a number of US 
administrators to keep the embargo intact until there was a full 
accounting of the missing servicemen. [passage omitted] 
  For the Vietnamese to forgive and forget is also laudable. 
It has to be remembered the extent to which the Vietnamese have 
suffered from the ravages of war. Since 1946 they have fought 
five wars almost continuously, and nearly 10 percent of the 
population of about 71 million is totally disabled. 
  Interestingly enough, one of the key questions on the minds 
of many is to what degree the issue of trade played a part in 
the presidential decision. Clearly, American companies have 
been represented in Hanoi for a long time but the embargo has 
always prevented them from assuming a full role in the booming 
Vietnamese economy. Because of this they have been forced to 
stay on the sidelines while European, Australian, Japanese, 
South Korean and Hong Kong companies have been able to get a 
good head start on them. 
  Obviously, this factor has been the main point of 
consideration, though in answering questions from reporters 
Clinton said the trade question did not influence his decision. 
  Unfortunately, the lifting of the trade embargo is not quite 
the same as the normalization of relation between Washington and 
Hanoi. Normalization usually involves the exchange of 
ambassadors and other diplomatic ties and these were certainly 
not a part of the current presidential decision. 
  However, it can be assumed that Vietnam will be seeking 
diplomatic ties with the United States. Since the collapse of 
the Soviet Union, Hanoi has been looking for a guarantor 
against China's expanding role in the region and sees Washington 
now being able to play the part. 
  The establishment of a US liaison office in Hanoi is indeed 
positive development and this must be seen as the first step on 
the path towards normalizing ties between the two countries. 
  With the lifting of the trade embargo, the United States and 
Vietnam can now look forward to a better future. This is indeed 
a good omen for the beginning of the new lunar year next week 
because, for the first time in decades, Vietnam is not at war or 
in conflict with any country.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Reflection of Human Rights"] </F>
  [Excerpt] The U.S. State Department indicated in its 
report on human rights that the situation in Thailand is still 
bad. In 1993 in particular, more than 60 suspects died during 
detention. The report also said suspects were quite often 
victims of extra-judicial execution by policemen. 
  The U.S. State Department indicated in its 1 February record 
on human rights in 193 nations that many countries in Asia are 
found to violate human rights. They include Thailand, India, 
Indonesia, Vietnam, and Pakistan. 
  According to the report, criminal suspects under detention 
often complained that they were victims of several kinds of 
torture by police authorities, including electric shock to force 
confessions. 
  The report also noted that human rights violations in 
Thailand included the abuse of women and children -- the 
procurement of women for prostitution and forced child labor are 
widespread. 
  Not a single leader in the government either acknowledged or 
rejected the State Department report on human rights violations 
in Thailand. Undoubtedly, Thailand in the eyes of the world is a 
country whose people still lack due rights and freedoms enjoyed 
by those under democratic governments. The prevailing human 
rights violations are a reflection that Thai people do not fully 
enjoy rights and freedoms prescribed in the Constitution which 
is the highest law of the nation. 
  The government therefore must review administrative policy 
and follow up implementation by authorities, especially when it 
concerns the justice system at all levels which directly 
involves people's rights and freedoms, and basic human rights in 
general. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Professor Marut Bunnak, speaker of the House of 
Representatives and president of the National Assembly, 
accompanied by his delegation this afternoon arrived at the 
Bangkok International Airport after paying official visits in 
Indochina. The Thai parliamentary delegation visited the Lao 
People's Democratic Republic, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, 
and the Republic of Cambodia from 1 to 7 February. The visit 
was termed highly successful. The Indochinese countries agreed 
with Thailand's proposal to set up parliamentary friendship 
associations which will highly benefit the Indochinese countries 
in terms of legislative and parliamentary development. The 
establishment of friendship associations between Thailand, Laos, 
Vietnam, and Cambodia should be accomplished in the near future 
to forge closer relations among those countries. 
  The Thai parliamentary delegation was accorded great honor 
and warm welcomes throughout the visit. It received requests to 
provide knowledge of modern laws and to introduce interesting 
laws of Thailand for the others to study. Thailand also 
discussed with Vietnam the fate of a group of Thai fishermen 
arrested there. Vietnam pledged to take proper steps in order to 
achieve their release prior to the visit to Vietnam in March by 
the Thai prime minister. 
  Asked by newsmen about Thai investment in Cambodia, Marut 
Bunnak said Thai businessmen encountered some small problems 
which should be settled through clarification of the contracts. 
He noted that it was only the beginning and Thai investors, 
therefore, should be careful about what they are doing. Anyway, 
he said those problems would have no impact on overall 
investment by Thai businessmen.

  [Text] Ho Chi Minh City, Feb 7 (AFP) -- A man who unfurled 
the flag of former South Vietnam during Ho Chi Minh City's first 
international marathon in December 1992 has been imprisoned for 
15 years, an official newspaper said Monday. Pham Van Quang, 52, 
was convicted by the Ho Chi Minh City People's Court of having 
"deliberately engaged in a subversive act in a public place," 
the Saigon Giai Phong (Liberated Saigon) daily said. 
  The court said that on December 16, 1992, when the city was 
hosting its first international marathon, Quang drove to crowded 
Me Linh square, in front of the Saigon Floating Hotel, where the 
marathon's media center was located. 
  Climbing onto the hood of his car, he waved the flag of the 
ousted Saigon regime and fired 19 shots to attract attention, 
the court account said. 
  It added that he pulled the pin of a hand grenade to scare 
away security officers. At the time, witnesses said the man was 
wearing the brown robes of the historically anti-communist Hoa 
Hao Buddhist sect. They did not report hearing any shots or 
seeing a grenade.

<F P=106> [Tran Trong Truy report on visit by party General Secretary </F>
Do Muoi and Politburo member Dao Duy Tung to Danang city from 31 
Jan to 2 Feb] 
  [Excerpts] Dear Friends: From 31 January to 2 February in 
Danang city, Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi and Comrade Dao 
Duy Tung, member of party Central Committee Political Bureau and 
secretary of the party Central Committee, held working sessions 
with the secretaries, deputy secretaries, and heads of party 
organization sections of provinces in the central region from 
Quang Binh to Binh Thuan and the three north-central highland 
provinces, to discuss preparations for midterm conferences of 
these provincial party organizations. 
  The comrade general secretary heard reports from various 
party cadres on plans to carry out midterm conferences of 
provincial party organizations which are expected to take place 
in late February and March this year. Attendees at these 
conferences will discuss the political reports of the party 
organizations and elect supplementary members for provincial 
party committees in accordance with the party by-laws. [passage 
omitted] 
  On direction for socioeconomic development of the central 
region provinces, the comrade general secretary pointed out that 
at present the central region still lags behind others in terms 
of economic development and living standards of local people. 
But the region also possesses latent strength and potential 
within its forest land, sea, minerals, geographical location, 
and especially the people here who inherit fine traditions of 
industriousness, intelligence, and brave and persistent 
determination in fighting against natural disasters and other 
enemies. These are advantages and conditions for a diversified 
development of the local economy. The general secretary 
stressed that the central region has a strategic position in 
terms of economic, security, and national defense. It is not 
true to say that the central government only cares about the 
other two regions and neglects the central one. The major water 
conservancy projects, the important hydroelectric projects in 
the central highlands, and the 500-kv electricity project are in 
the interests of the central region. We have at the same time 
too many things to be done and we have to do them in sequence 
aiming to serve the national interest in the principle of 
equality to all regions. 
  The comrade general secretary urged the provincial 
authorities to find suitable and effective measures and 
strategies to develop economic potential, to build more water 
conservancy projects, to cover all empty lands and bare hills, 
and to develop other employment branches in order to promote 
industrialization. The localities also need to intensify their 
exports, limit and substitute imports, exploit the advantage of 
sea transport, and consolidate interaction between provinces in 
business relations with foreign countries. 
  The comrade general secretary pointed out an issue that 
needs 
to be tackled urgently which is programs to eliminate hunger and 
reduce poverty for people in mountain and minority ethnic 
regions, as well as in former revolutionary bases. The programs 
need to motivate self-help consciousness among people and avoid 
a reliant attitude, and only in this way can socioeconomic 
development can be attained. He said: We are to be seriously 
blamed if we let the families of wounded soldiers and war dead 
live in poverty. We have to invest in building and developing 
the former revolutionary bases. We have to be just and fair in 
distribution of production materials and supplies as stipulated 
by the party resolution. 
  The comrade general secretary said: To correctly carry out 
the two strategic tasks of building and safeguarding our 
fatherland, we must focus on building our party cleanly and 
steadfastly, and on heightening the militancy and self-control 
spirit among the party member contingent. The party members 
must exercise solidarity and attach utmost importance to mass 
motivation tasks in order to build up an all-people solidarity 
block. The party cadres should work for the people, be close to 
people, and not be revolutionary mandarins. All our work should 
be devoted to the development and prosperity of our country and 
the happiness of the people. [passage omitted] 
  During their visit to Quang Nam-Danang, Comrades General 
Secretary Do Muoi and his entourage paid visits to several 
localities and families of peasants and fishermen who are among 
the poorest people in Zone 2, Phuoc Ly Ward in Danang city; and 
the Que Linh Village in Que Son District, 60-km from Danang, one 
of the former revolutionary bases which is still very poor. 
Comrade general secretary entered houses and warmly talked to 
the poor peasants and presented a number of new year gifts to 
families of wounded soldiers and war dead. He urged the party 
committees and local authorities to carry out effective measures 
to quickly solve socioeconomic problems of people in mountain 
and remote areas, with the prime attention focused on developing 
water conservancy projects. He said: I have been working for 
the revolution all my life and whenever I talk to peasants I 
always remember three main points: first, peasants must have 
their land; second, water conservancy is important; and third, 
capital must be available. In order to eliminate hunger and 
reduce poverty quickly, we must help peasants in these three 
areas. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The government office issued a notice on 2 
February, saying Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and Deputy Prime 
Minister Phan Van Khai personally met Comrade Nguyen Van, 
director-general of the Vietnam Union of Sericultural 
Enterprises in Ho Chi Minh City on 7 January 1994. 
  After hearing Mr. Le Xuan Trinh, minister of state and head 
of the government office, give a briefing on the actual 
financial situation of the union and the responsibility of 
Director-General Nguyen Van, and based on the views of various 
responsible statement mangement sectors, on a protest note from 
the Supreme People's Organ of Control, on the results of an 
audit conducted by the Ministry of Finance, on inferences of the 
personnel affairs section of the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Food Industry and of the Lam Dong provincial party committee as 
well as on the many public views reported earlier, and after 
hearing various sectors express their views, Prime Minister Vo 
Van Kiet and Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai arrived at the 
following decision: 
  1. The Vietnamese sericultural sector is one of the 
country's high potential sectors. It has been and is providing 
employment to hundreds of thousands of workers. However, 
present and long-term development plans for the sericultural 
sector must be carefully worked out. As the main end-product of 
the sericultural sector is destined for export, we must accept 
the mode of development and production in line with the market 
system and international competition. 
  2. Violations committed in the past by the union of 
sericultural enterpises in financial management principles were 
grave. These include using short-term capital loans for capital 
construction, especially for a number of projects which are not 
necessary for sericultural production and are characteristic of 
showiness, failing to develop any economic results. In a number 
of projects built with short-term capital loans, the union has 
failed to comply with state stipulations. The union's 
expenditure management has not been strict enough. Its sluggish 
debt payment has resulted in a higher interest rate which the 
union can hardly afford. The responsibility for these 
violations rests with Director-General Nguyen Van. 
  Director-General Nguyen Van used part of the loans obtained 
from the state to buy silk cocoons from the people and to carry 
out capital construction, such as buying certain equipment and 
transportation means. He also built a number of projects such 
as hotels and shopping centers just for show without taking into 
consideration their economic results and the consequential bank 
interest payments. He also failed to carefully consider various 
factors such as product quantity and quality and production cost 
when it comes to borrowing money from a number of countries to 
import silk-reeling and weaving tools. 
  Comrade Nguyen Van is a cadre who has devoted himself to the 
development of the Vietnamese sericultural sector. He planned 
to develop a specialized sericultural production center in the 
Bao Loc hilly area for use as a basis for nationwide 
sericultural production efforts, trying to build a sizable 
industry with Bao Loc as a center. However, having committed 
such shortcomings is very grave. Noteworthy is the fact that the 
prime minister has on several occasions warned Comrade Nguyen 
Van, the minister of agriculture and food industry, and the 
secretary of the Lam Dong provincial party committee about the 
irregularities committed by the union in using its capital loans. 
  It is requested that the Ministry of Agriculture and Food 
Industry's personnel affairs section and the minister of 
agriculture and food industry sternly criticize Comrade Nguyen 
Van for his irregularities, and that Comrade Nguyen Van be made 
to face stern disciplinary actions given the fact that he is the 
head of a giant union. 
  If Comrade Nguyen Van is willing to correct his wrongdoings 
and continue to devote himself to the sericultural sector, to 
place himself under the ministry's control, and to accept the 
assistance of various state organs, he will be able to continue 
his service with the sericultural sector. It is also necessary 
for him to rectify the production and business activities of his 
union to bring it back to effective operation and to clear up 
its debts. 
  The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry must sternly 
criticize the board of directors of the union and strengthen it 
so it will become more competent to serve the cause of 
sericultural growth and will see economic results as the 
ultimate goal as opposed to any excessively showy formats 
without taking into account economic results. 
  As for the union's party executive committee, the Ministry 
of 
Agriculture and Food Industry must provide the Lam Dong 
provincial party committee with a detailed report with 
recommendations so the latter can criticize the committee over 
this issue in accordance with the party's principles and statute. 
  The criticism of Comrade Nguyen Van and the disciplinary 
actions taken against him as well as efforts to criticize and 
revamp the union's board of directors must be completed within 
the first quarter of 1994 if we are to promptly stabilize the 
union's production and business activities. 
  The comrade minister of agriculture and food industry must 
criticize himself in view of his responsibility of providing 
managerial guidance for the union in the past. 
  Responsible sectors, especially specialized commercial banks 
which have provided capital loans to the union, must also show a 
sense of responsbility by helping the union resolve its present 
difficulties. The state bank governor must also criticize 
himself given his responsibility to provide state management. 
He must also criticize specialized commercial banks for having 
as a result of their lack of control and auditing failed to 
detect the mistake of loaning a large sum of money to the union 
to use for inappropriate purposes as noted above. 
  Presently, the financial situation of the union is very 
difficult. As the union is an important union of the state 
whose survival has an effect, both directly and indirectly, on 
the employment and welfare of hundreds of thousands of 
sericultural workers, we must, on the one hand, point out the 
shortcomings of the union so it can correct them while, on the 
other, seek ways to consolidate the union, trying to bring the 
union's activities onto the right track, effectively reorganize 
the union's production and business activities, secure and 
recover the amount of capital already invested by the state in 
the union, make full use of the source of agricultural labor and 
the latent potential in land and climate of various areas in the 
country for sericultural production, and increase the 
competitive power of our sericultural products in the world 
market. 
  The prime minister decided on a number of specific 
corrective 
measures aimed at rectifying the operations of the Vietnam Union 
of Sericultural Enterprises. These measures include those 
designed to clear up debts; to rectify those tasks involving 
finance, capital, assets, equipment management, and renovating 
the union organizationally; and so forth in order to continue to 
maintain and develop the sericultural sector at a time when we 
are shifting to a market economy amid increasingly tough world 
competition in this field of activity.

<F P=106> [Report by station correspondent Truong Cong Hoa on a Tet </F>
get-together with fallen combatant's families by party and state 
leaders in the Presidential Palace on 2 February -- portions 
recorded] 
  [Summary] "Dear friends, in an enthusiastic atmosphere 
when the country is entering its spring, this morning, Saturday 
5 February at the Presidential Palace, our party and government 
held a Tet get-together with nearly 300 fallen combatant 
families who represented all families of injured soldiers and 
fallen combatants in the entire country. 
  "Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi, state President Le Duc 
Anh, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, National Assembly Chairman Nong 
Duc Manh, party Central Committee Advisers Pham Van Dong and Vo 
Chi Cong, and high ranking party and state cadres from the 
central and Hanoi organs attended the function. Before coming 
to the Presidential Palace, the families visited President Ho 
Chi Minh in his mausoleum." 
  In a solemn and friendly atmosphere, General Secretary Do 
Muoi, Comrades Pham Van Dong and Vo Chi Cong, state President Le 
Duc Anh, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, National Assembly Chairman 
Nong Duc Manh, and leading party and state cadres warmly 
received the families and invited them into the Presidential 
Palace. The families were moved when they listened to the 
statement made by State President Le Duc Anh. He said: 
  [Begin Le Duc Anh recording] "Ladies, Gentlemen, and 
Comrades: Inheriting and developing the heroic and indomitable 
tradition of our Vietnamese people from thousands of years of 
national construction and protection, in more than half a 
century, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of 
Vietnam and beloved Uncle Ho, our people conducted an extremely 
formidable and brave struggle against mighty invading forces to 
regain our national independence and freedom. 
  "Right here, when the invasion war was at its peak, 
President 
Ho Chi Minh declared: The war may prolong to five, ten, or 20 
years or longer. Hanoi, Haiphong, and certain industrial cities 
may be damaged. But the Vietnamese people are not in fear. 
Nothing is more precious than independence and freedom. 
  "Uncle Ho spoke about the willpower, determination, and 
aspirations of the entire people who had been miserably living 
long nights of slavery with only oppression, prison, and wars, 
but not democracy and human rights. In order to achieve the 
present glorious victory, our people in the entire country 
exerted their utmost efforts and endured much long suffering. 
Dozens of millions of compatriots and soldiers contributed 
outstanding service. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers were 
killed in prisons and battlefields. Our Vietnamese people 
eternally acknowledge and voluminously appreciate the fallen 
combatants who sacrificed themselves for the nation's 
independence and people's freedom and democracy. 
  "On behalf of the party, government, people, and soldiers, I 
bow myself at the soul of fallen combatants who sacrafied for 
our great national cause. I deeply appreciate families of 
fallen combatants and mothers who bore and brought up brave, 
stubborn, and loyal children before offering their beloved 
children for the survival of our fatherland. Especially, the 
noble mothers who sent off their children for national service 
three, five, and seven times. And all of them were killed on 
the battlefields, never returning to their mothers."

  [Excerpts] General Doan Khue, member of the party Central 
Committee Political Bureau and minister of national defense, 
recently made a working visit to inspect Group B-24's training 
activities in the Fourth Military Region. [passage omitted] 
  The Thao Nguyen Regiment has served as a model training unit 
for Group B-24 and the Fourth Military Region. Last year, the 
regiment completed its training program in a satisfactory 
manner. Those participating in skills contests in land 
transportation, artillery, engineering, communications, and air 
defense all won first or second prizes from the Fourth Military 
Region and the Ministry of National Defense. 
  Despite difficulties with budget allocations, lack of seeds, 
and bad weather conditions, the cadres and soldiers of the Thao 
Nguyen Regiment and other units under Group B-24 actively 
participated in production to improve their living conditions. 
The quality of their daily meals has improved considerably. 
Tens of hectares of land have been turned into ponds to raise 
fish. Each cadre or soldier has turned out 11 kg of vegetables 
per month. Cultivation and animal husbandry have generated 
additional income. As a result, meals have been supplemented by 
250 to 300 dong each. Group B-24's personnel usually have three 
dishes at each meal. This has put an end to the bad practice of 
making one's own cooking arrangements and other negative habits. 
As many as 97 to 98 percent of the troops stay healthy and 
participate in learning and training activities. The work 
performance of 10 of the Thao Nguyen Regiment's 12 troop feeding 
units has been rated as good. As an example, one can cite the 
troop feeding units of the 4th and 5th Battalions and the 
regimental command. 
  Also on this occasion, Gen. Doan Khue called on a number of 
mothers of fallen combatants who live near the group's 
bivouacking area. He visited Mrs. Duong Thi Nga and her family. 
Two of Mrs. Nga's sons have been listed as fallen combatants. 
Besides the care provided by the local party committee and 
administration, Mrs. Nga and other mothers of fallen combatants 
here are also assisted by the cadres and soldiers of Group B-24. 
Gen. Doan Khue also visited Mrs. Nguyen Thi Vung and her 
family. Mrs. Vung's three sons and one son-in-law have been 
listed as fallen combatants. Mother Vung is 90 years old. 
During the course of the anti-U.S. national salvation struggle, 
Mother Vung actively motivated her children to set out and fight 
the enemy. Now, as in the past, the mothers of fallen 
combatants always motivate the soldiers to undergo training and 
stand ready for combat.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by National Assembly Standing Committee; </F>
date not given] 
  [Text] From 28 January to 2 February, the National Assembly 
Standing Committee [NASC] held a meeting under the direction of 
National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh. Vice President Nguyen 
Thi Binh attended the meeting. 
  1. The NASC spent a great deal of time discussing and 
deciding on the 1994 NASC program of actions, including issues 
related to its law-building program, supervision program, and 
external relations activities to execute resolutions adopted by 
the Ninth National Assembly Fourth Session. 
  The NASC outlined concrete guidelines and measures to 
accelerate its legislation, supervision, and external relations 
activities together with 1994 key duties, especially the fight 
against corruption and smuggling. It also discussed and drew on 
experience for the guidance, regulation, and coordination of 
activities performed by the Nationalities Committee and other 
committees of the National Assembly in order to satisfactorily 
complete the outlined duties. 
  2. The NASC listened to reports presented by representatives 
of the government, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme 
People's Organ of Control on the implementation of the National 
Assembly resolutions and laws introduced by the National 
Assembly in its Fourth Session. It also examined reports from 
the Ministries of Interior, Commerce, and Construction on their 
urgent works to execute the National Assembly resolutions. 
  The NASC praises the government, central organs, and local 
authorities for their quick implementation of recently-adopted 
resolutions and laws. At the same time, the NASC wants to 
emphasize the importance of the introduction of documents to 
provide guidance for the execution of the laws and concrete 
guidelines and measures for the government and responsible 
organs to observe in their implementation process. 
  3. The NASC examined the government report on the allocation 
of the 1994 state budget after the government had completed his 
working sessions with ministries, government agencies, and local 
authorities. The NASC approves the allocation planning. It 
reminds that in the implementation process, the government must 
closely observe the estimation of budget revenues and expenses 
mentioned in the National Assembly resolution. At the same 
time, the government must introduce concrete measures and 
policies to increase revenue, save money, and create more 
capital resources to accelerate the socioeconomic development. 
  4. The NASC offered its opinions on the draft regulation on 
the coordination between different government agencies in their 
guidance for the implementation of the National Assembly 
resolutions on practicing frugality and fighting waste, 
corruption, and smuggling. The NASC discussed many important 
issues of the draft regulation, especially the objectives and 
scope of the coordination and the responsibility of each 
government agency, head of government agencies, National 
Assembly deputy, and National Assembly delegations in executing 
the National Assembly resolutions. This draft regulation needs 
to be perfected by seeking opinions from related organs for 
early implementation. 
  5. Based on the recommendation of the chief justice of the 
Supreme People's Court, the NASC approved the appointment of 
Senior Lieutenant General Nguyen Nam Khanh, deputy director of 
the Political General Department of the Vietnam People's Army, 
to the Selection Committee of Judges for the Supreme People's 
Courts and to the Central Military Court to replace retiring 
Lieut. Gen. Nguyen Oanh, deputy chief justice of the Supreme 
People's Court and Chief Judge of the Central Military Court.

  [Text] In 1993, the An Giang Province Import-Export 
Corporation exported 40,000 tons of food and agricultural 
products of all kinds, achieving an import-export index of 
nearly 24 million dollars. The corporation began implementing 
two joint ventures involving more than one million dollars in 
capital investment with foreign firms. It also encouraged 
peasants to sign contracts to grow subsidiary food crops of high 
economic value to meet export demands, helping them with seeds, 
technological assistance, and product consumption. As a result, 
hundreds of hectares of land have been zoned off for planting 
Japanese red beans, black sesame, and mushrooms to meet export 
demands.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 7 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
will call a meeting of national security-related cabinet 
ministers Tuesday morning to discuss the North Korean nuclear 
issue and overall security on the Korean peninsula. 
  The meeting will be attended by Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang, 
Deputy Prime Minister and National Unification Minister Yi 
Yong-tok, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and Defense Minister Yi 
Pyong-tae. 
  The ministers are likely to work out measures to deal with 
the latest developments in the nuclear issue and security 
concerns on the peninsula, his aides said. 
  At this year's first national security meeting, President 
Kim and his ministers are expected to analyze the negotiations 
between North Korea and the International Atomic energy agency 
on IAEA inspections. 
  They will then discuss possible international action on the 
matter, sources said. 
  Specifically, the issues include referral to the United 
Nations Security Council of the North Korean question and the 
North's military activities in relation to security in the South. 
  They will also study a third round of high-level talks 
between Washington and Pyongyang on improving relations and the 
content of North Korean President Kim Il-song's personal message 
to U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  The meeting, coming only one day before the three-day Lunar 
New Year's holiday, reflects the sense of urgency among South 
Korean Government leaders as the deadline for resolving the 
North Korean nuclear issue fast approaches, the sources said. 
  The Seoul Government wants to establish firm measures on the 
nuclear problem and dispel anxiety among South Korean citizens, 
they said. It has been widely reported that the United States 
will refer the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security 
Council unless Pyongyang and the IAEA reach some kind of 
agreement on inspections before Feb. 21, when the IAEA convenes 
a three-day Board of Governors' meeting. 
  Chongwadae spokesman Chu Ton-sik, however, tried to 
diminish the rising sense of crisis when he told reporters that 
the meeting is not being held because of any urgent developments 
in the North Korean nuclear problem. 
  "The nuclear problem has surfaced as an important question 
(for the government) and a pending issue throughout the world," 
Chu said, explaining the meeting's background. 
  Those attending the meeting include Kim Tok, director of the 
Agency for National Security Planning, Gen. Yi Yang-ho, chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Chong Chong-uk, senior 
presidential secretary for foreign affairs and national security.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 7 (YONHAP) -- The reason for President 
Kim Yong-sam to convene a meeting of national security-related 
cabinet ministers Tuesday is two-fold. 
  First, Kim wants to check out the overall security situation 
on the Korean peninsula in connection with the North Korean 
nuclear issue and dispel ordinary citizens' anxiety amid a 
rising sense of crisis. 
  Secondly, the president wants to discuss measures to counter 
any possible developments resulting from a failure in 
negotiations between North Korea and the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) before Feb. 21. 
  No deadline has been set for Pyongyang and the IAEA to agree 
on IAEA inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities, but the 
United States has said it will have to refer the issue to the 
United Nations Security Council if the two sides cannot arrange 
for comprehensive inspections before the IAEA convenes a Board 
of Governors' meeting on Feb. 21. 
  Despite obvious efforts to minimize the seriousness of the 
problem, reports reaching Seoul from Washington, Pyongyang and 
elsewhere are disquieting, to say the least. 
  A North Korean Foreign Ministry statement on Jan. 31 
threatened withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty 
(NPT) if the United States keeps pressing Pyongyang with its 
"unjustifiable" demand to accept comprehensive IAEA inspections. 
  North Korea has openly talked about the possibility of 
another Korean war breaking out on the peninsula, envisioning a 
total defeat for the United States. 
  The IAEA can only conduct limited inspections, Pyongyang has 
said. 
  In view of the North Korean position, the United States is 
showing a much more resolute response than before. 
  Washington will no longer use a "carrot" in its efforts to 
persuade North Korea to accept IAEA inspections before Feb. 21. 
Instead, the United States has made it clear it will have to 
refer the question to the United Nations. 
  The United States briefed the other permanent members of the 
U.N. Security Council -- China, Russia, Britain and France -- 
over the weekend and requested their cooperation for action the 
United States will ask the world body to take against North 
Korea. 
  Moreover, there have been reports that if North Korea 
provokes another war against South Korea, the United States 
would not only defend against aggression but launch a 
counterattack, pushing the aggressors all the way back to 
Pyongyang. 
  Judging by these latest developments, the chances of the two 
sides reaching a dramatic breakthrough at the last moment are 
slim. 
  In other words, "the worst possible situation" is envisaged 
rather than a resolution of the question through dialogue. 
  This is what prompted President Kim to hastily convene 
Tuesday's meeting. 
  Consequently, President Kim and his ministers will take a 
close look at North Korean military movements and overall 
security on the peninsula. The Kim administration thus hopes to 
reassure the people, whose anxiety "has been amplified 
unnecessarily" of late. 
  The National Unification Board, and the Foreign and Defense 
Ministries all publicly say that "there has been no urgent 
development or North Korean military provocation that warrants 
immediate attention." 
  Tuesday's meeting, therefore, could very well make the 
official pronouncement that "the sense of crisis" touted by 
certain segments of the U.S. Government and press is 
exaggerated. 
  President Kim and the ministers are also expected to discuss 
in depth South Korean Government measures against every possible 
North Korean action. 
  Although there may be many aspects of North Korean nuclear 
policy, they can be place into two broad categories. 
  First is what Pyongyang will do if and when the nuclear 
issue 
is referred to the U.N. Security Council. 
  The second concerns a sudden turnaround by North Korea in 
accepting IAEA inspections at the last minute. 
  The Seoul government is most likely to reaffirm its position 
of striving to persuade Pyongyang to follow the second course of 
action: South Korea believes that the North Korean nuclear 
question has to be resolved through dialogue. 
  In any event, Tuesday's meeting will also discuss what Seoul 
can do if North Korea pushes the issue over the brink.
