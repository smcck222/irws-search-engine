  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 5 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu said Saturday that South Korea's consistent position on 
the North Korean nuclear problem is to solve the problem through 
dialogue. Han said at the closing ceremony of the annual 
conference of Korean ambassadors and envoys, "there has been an 
criticism that our policies on the North Korean nuclear problem 
are vague and not consistent. But this is different from the 
fact. 
  "There is no change in the government's position that it 
solves the problem through dialogue." 
  It is important, however, he said, for the government to 
take 
flexible measures according to change of the situation. And in 
the context, the government policies should maintain the 
"dynamic consistency." 
  "But we cannot rule out the possibility that the government 
may face an extreme situation where it should take decisive 
measures on the North Korean nuclear problem," he said. "Even 
in that case, the government will not give up the efforts to 
solve the problem through dialogue." 
  Meanwhile, Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong told 
journalist Saturday that, even if sanctions are used to solve 
the North Korean nuclear problem, the door to dialogue with 
Seoul will always be open to Pyongyang.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 7 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu said on Monday that the North Korean nuclear issue 
would be referred to the UN Security Council if Pyongyang did 
not allow the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to 
inspect its nuclear facilities by Feb. 21, when the IAEA Board 
of Governors is to meet. 
  IAEA Director General Hans Blix would tell the Board of 
Governors meeting the continuity of safeguards at North Korean 
nuclear facilities is not maintained in that case, Han told in 
his briefing session on foreign affairs for opposition 
Democratic Party [DP] leaders, including chairman Yi Ki-taek, on 
that morning. 
  Should North Korea receive IAEA inspections and resume 
inter-Korean dialogue for a new round of high-level talks with 
the United States, Seoul and Washington would promote a thorough 
and broad dialogue with Pyongyang for complete solution of the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, Han said. 
  Commenting on the Patriot missile deployment issue, the 
foreign minister said negotiations are under way with the United 
States on whether the antimissile missiles should be deployed in 
South Korea and when they should be deployed, if need be, in 
order not to provoke North Korea, saying, "This is a very 
sensitive point of time in the effort to solve the North Korean 
nuclear issue." 
  The U.S. Government is positively studying a plan to deploy 
Patriot batteries in South Korea at the recommendation of U.S. 
Forces Korea commander Gen. Gary luck, but Seoul has asked 
Washington to see to it that the U.S. press will be prudent in 
reporting about the plan in view of the influence on the 
on-going North Korea-IAEA negotiations and because the plan is 
still under negotations between Seoul and Washington. 
  Minister Han said negotiations are under way with Tokyo and 
Beijing on the schedules of President Kim Yong-sam's visits of 
the two countries in march, adding that his visit to Russia 
within the year is also being seriously studied. 
  To prepare for the new world trade order under the world 
trade organization to be established in 1995, Han said, the 
government will strengthen trade diplomacy and actively 
participate in the new round of multilateral negotiations on 
environment and labor.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu will meet with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
in Washington on 18 February to finalize the two countries' 
positions regarding the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  In a meeting with Secretary of State Christopher, Foreign 
Minister Han is expected to earnestly discuss the conclusion of 
an extradition treaty between the ROK and the United States. 
  The ROK and the United States have set the date of 21 
February, when the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
Board of Governors' meeting is scheduled, as the deadline for 
the settlement of the nuclear issue. Depending on North Korea's 
attitude toward the nuclear issue, therefore, the 18 February 
meeting between Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and U.S. 
leadership may be the last meeting to discuss follow-up steps 
for after 21 February. 
  Concerning North Korea's attitude toward the settlement of 
the nuclear issue, a relevant government high-level official 
said on 5 February that "as of today, the IAEA and the United 
States have not received any official notification from North 
Korea regarding its position to cancel its decision to delay the 
withdrawal of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty," and that 
"there is therefore no change in the ROK and U.S. Governments' 
positions of resolving the nuclear issue through dialogue." 
  He said that "it will indeed be difficult to resolve the 
nuclear issue through dialogue once international sanctions have 
been imposed on North Korea," and added: "It is sensible to 
continue efforts for dialogue with the North Korean side, since 
there is no way of knowing what results will be gained once 
sanctions are imposed on North Korea." 
  He said that "reports by foreign papers that North Korea 
would refuse to accept nuclear inspection by the IAEA are not 
true."

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 5 (YONHAP) -- Among the member 
countries of the Board of Governors of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA), concern about North Korea's nuclear 
program is rising and if the problem of inspections is not 
solved by Feb. 21, the board is likely to take decisive action, 
Korean Ambassador to Vienna Yi Si-yong said on Saturday. 
  Yi is here to attend a meeting of chiefs of Korean overseas 
missions. 
  The board of governors has expressed deep concern that North 
Korea rejects not only special but also general inspections. If 
this goes on, the IAEA's dignity will be stained and the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) itself may be compromised, leading 
the board's member countries to share the position that the IAEA 
should take firm action against Pyongyang, Yi said. 
  "Unless the contacts between the IAEA and North Korea bring 
a 
concrete solution on nuclear inspections by Feb. 21, the day 
the board of governors meets, IAEA Director-General Hans Blix 
will report to the United Nations Security Council that the IAEA 
can not guarantee that nuclear materials in North Korea won't be 
used for military purposes," Yi said. 
  Yi envisioned two scenarios: The IAEA will adopt a moderate 
resolution if North Korea agrees to nuclear inspections by Feb. 
21, or the agency will have to report to the UN Security Council 
on the matter if a solution is not found by then.

<F P=106> [By Chin Chang-uk from Washington] </F>
  [Text] On 4 February, the permanent members of the UN 
Security Council, including the United States, the United 
Kingdom, France, Russia, and China, held a closed-door meeting 
at the request of the United States to discuss the North Korean 
nuclear issue. It has been learned that China was informed of a 
UN plan to impose economic sanctions against North Korea. China 
was then asked to cooperate with the plan. 
  This indicates that the UN Security Council has initiated 
its 
meetings to earnestly discuss sanctions against North Korea as 
the deadline for the nuclear inspection of North Korea by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] -- which is scheduled 
for 22 February -- is imminent. It is therefore very 
significant. 
  A source said: Madeleine Albright, U.S. ambassador to the 
United Nations, who arranged that day's meeting, gave a briefing 
on the status of the negotiation process between the IAEA and 
North Korea, and said that the UN Security Council should take 
"action" against North Korea if no agreement was reached between 
the IAEA and North Korea. British, French, and Russian 
ambassadors supported the U.S. position.

<F P=106> [By Chong Hae-yong from Washington] </F>
  [Text] A well-informed source in Washington said on 3 
February that Ho Chong, North Korean deputy ambassador to the 
United Nations, visited Pyongyang between late January and early 
February. Observers said that Pyongyang may introduce a new 
negotiations card in settling the nuclear issue, since Ho Chong 
was in North Korea while the Reverend Billy Graham was there 
with a message from President Clinton 
  The source said: So far, North Korea has kept in contact 
with its mission to the United Nations via communication 
facilities, such as telephone or fax. North Korea's summoning 
of Ho Chong is an indication that the North Korean side is 
worried over leakage of information on their negotiations 
strategy through wire taps by the United States into the 
communication links between Pyongyang and the North Korean 
missions in New York.

  [Text] Yu Chong-ha, ROK ambassador to the United Nations, 
said that China will not veto sanctions against North Korea if 
the North Korean nuclear issue is referred to the UN Security 
Council. 
  Ambassador Yu Chong-ha, appearing on KBS-1 Television's News 
Forum this morning, said that because international society has 
made all efforts to get North Korea to accept nuclear 
inspections, China will not oppose international society's 
measures against North Korea if North Korea rejects nuclear 
inspection to the end. 
  Ambassador Yu added that even though North Korea has delayed 
talks to maximize efficiency in negotiations, China views that 
North Korea will, eventually, accept the international society's 
demand for nuclear inspections. 
  Ambassador Yu said that even when North Korea's nuclear 
issue 
is referred to the UN Security Council, immediate sanctions 
against North Korea will not imposed. He added that because the 
UN Security Council chairman's statement must first be announced 
and it must be followed with the adoption of a UN resolution, it 
will take about a month for sanctions to be imposed on North 
Korea.

  [Text] Thinking that because President Kim Il-song has not 
been properly briefed about the seriousness of the situation 
concerning North Korea's nuclear issue by officials in charge of 
nuclear negotiations, the negotiations on nuclear inspections 
between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA] have been in a rupture, the ROK and the United States are 
taking pains to take a countermeasure. 
  As a result of generally analyzing the remarks of evangelist 
Billy Graham, who visited Pyongyang on 31 January; UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali; and Gary Ackerman, chairman of the 
Asia-Pacific Affairs Subcommittee of the House Foreign Relations 
Committee, who personally met with President Kim Il-song 
recently; the ROK and the United States can see that such an 
analysis is very likely to be true. 
  According to authorities concerned on 6 February, President 
Kim Il-song has an optimistic view that the nuclear issue will 
be properly resolved through dialogue with the United States but 
he is not aware that North Korea should accept full-scope 
inspections by the IAEA in a bid to hold dialogue with the 
United States. 
  On the same day, a government official said that "It was 
highly likely that North Korean officials in charge of nuclear 
issues reported to President Kim that accepting only limited 
inspections [chehan sachal] by the IAEA is necessary to resolve 
the nuclear issue." He added that "They, however, have not 
reported again to President Kim Il-song that North Korea should 
accept full-scope inspections to meet the IAEA's demand." 
  Considering the closed North Korean system, the ROK and the 
United States are concerned about the fact that because North 
Korean officials in charge of nuclear negotiations worry about 
their reshuffle, they will adhere to the limited inspections 
without using a "negotiation card" in negotiations on 
inspections and, thus, they may lead the situation to an 
unexpected catastrophe, including the nuclear issue which may be 
referred to the UN Security Council.

Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by correspondent Yi Hong-ki in Jerusalem,

audible in English that differ from the Korean translation] 
  [Text] At the beginning of the year, KBS realized for the 
first time an exclusive interview with PLO Chairman 'Arafat. 
Following this, KBS realized an exclusive interview with Israeli 
Prime Minister Rabin, who is the negotiation partner of Chairman 
'Arafat. In the interview with KBS, Prime Minister Rabin 
revealed his views on the North Korean nuclear issue and 
economic cooperation with the ROK. Correspondent Yi Hong-ki 
reports from Jerusalem. 
  [Begin recording] [Yi] In an interview with KBS, Israeli 
Prime Minister Rabin pointed out that North Korea is a dangerous 
state, not only for the ROK but also for the Middle East. He 
stressed that it is the responsibility of the international 
community to check North Korea's provocative intention. 
  [Rabin] We look at North Korea as a great danger not only to 
your country but also to the Middle East. North Korea does not 
make any effort for the nonproliferation of weapons. It has even 
long-range missiles. The North Koreans do not participate 
in any international agreement in a practical way. To prevent 
preparations of non-conventional weapons and long-range 
missiles.... 
  [Yi] Prime Minister Rabin said that the ROK's development 
experience will be helpful to the economic development in the 
Middle East, and hoped that the ROK will actively participate in 
the construction and industrialization fields. 
  Prime Minister Rabin pointed out that the agreement on the 
implementation of the Palestinian autonomy is aimed at opening a 
new phase. Therefore, it is the most important issue for the two 
sides to reach a satisfactory agreement, thus suggesting a 
possibility of delaying the time of concluding the agreement. 
  [Rabin] Even though the time is important, the basic 
question is to have an agreement with the Palestinians and with 
the PLO that will bring about implementation, a good one. 
  [Yi] Prime Minister Rabin said that no fixed date has been 
designated for the withdrawal of the Israeli Army from the 
planned Palestinian autonomous area but only a goal is set for 
the withdrawal at an appropriate time. Therefore, the deadline 
for the withdrawal of 13 April is not likely to be the important 
issue of dispute. [end recording]

  [Text] Ichiro Ozawa, representative secretary of the Japan

the Japanese coalition government, said that he believes North 
Korea already possesses nuclear weapons, and predicted that 
power a struggle will arise in North Korea after President Kim 
Il-song is retreated. 
  In a television interview this morning, Secretary Ozawa said 
that North Korea apparently possesses nuclear weapons. But he 
failed to show evidence that can support his allegation of 
suspicion of nuclear arms development. He pointed out that 
North Korea is an incredibly fanatic society and that the 
struggle will be triggered so that the right succeeds to power 
after Kim is retreated and that there is a possibility that an 
upheaval will be touched off on the Korean peninsula.

<F P=106> [Report by Chin Chang-uk from Washington] </F>
  [Text] The WASHINGTON POST reported on 7 February: The 
U.S. Government seems to believe that its efforts to resolve the 
North Korean nuclear issue have indeed failed. Accordingly, the 
U.S. Department of Defense has already instructed U.S. reserve 
troops on its mainland to prepare for participation in the Team 
Spirit exercise. 
  The paper reported on 7 February that the time for 
negotiations to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue have 
likely run out, and that the U.S. Government's attitude 
indicates there are some changes in its position, which has so 
far expected the nuclear issue to be resolved by diplomatic 
efforts. 
  The paper reported that the U.S. Department of Defense had 
ordered an additional 1,000 U.S. reserve troops to report to 
U.S. Forces stationed in the ROK if the North Korean nuclear 
issue is not resolved before 21 February, when the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] Board of Governors meeting is 
scheduled. 
  The paper reported: IAEA authorities in Vienna have said 
that they are getting tired of holding negotiations with North 
Korea regarding inspection conditions and that they expect the 
IAEA Board of Governors to refer the North Korean nuclear issue 
to the UN Security Council. 
  The paper also reported that the White House would soon 
determine and announce the deployment of Patriot missiles to 
U.S. Forces in the ROK. 
  The Team Spirit joint military exercise, which has been 
conducted by the ROK and the United States since 1976, is 
prepared for in early January every year. In early March, field 
mobile exercises of the Team Spirit exercise are usually 
conducted. Up to the present time, however, the ROK and the 
United States have not prepared for the exercise as a result of 
nuclear negotiations between the IAEA and North Korea.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "U.S. Military Salesmanship"] </F>
  [Text] As the Republic of Korea and the United States are 
endeavoring to bolster their combined defense capabilities amid 
the heightening tension over the North Korean nuclear 
development program, it is worried that commercial factors might 
play a role in the decision-making process on crucial security 
affairs. 
  When Washington officials confirmed the U.S. plan to deploy 
Patriot missile batteries in Korea on a request from the 
commander of the U.S. Forces in Korea, there were immediate 
speculation of a possible link with moves to promote the sale of 
the now-famous anti-missile system to Korea. Recent U.S. media 
reports included quotations from senior U.S. defense officials 
encouraging South Korea to consider the purchase of the Patriot 
missile which they vouched as the best system at the present 
time. 
  It is known that Seoul's defense authorities have had 
considerable interest in the Patriot system since its employment 
in the Gulf War and that preliminary negotiations started in 
mid-1993 between military procurement officials here and the 
Raytheon Co., the U.S. manufacturer of the missile. Yet, it is 
not quite gratifying to witness U.S. officials showing great 
salesmanship as if representing their defense contractors. 
  On top of this, an embarrassing document has been disclosed 
here involving U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense William Perry in 
which Perry, who has been nominated for Pentagon chief, strongly 
suggested that South Korea purchase a specific airborne 
self-protection jammer for the Korean Fighter Program on a 
commercial basis. U.S. reports have it that this particular 
ASPJ system had been found defective in tests, adding to our 
dismay. 
  Under the U.S. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, which 
has been the primary channel of Korea's procurement of U.S. 
military hardware, the U.S. Government, which often arranges 
long-term, low-interest credits for the transactions, retains 
the right to approve the supply of specific items. 
  In the course of implementing the FMS program, the 
possibility of U.S. defense officials' opinions affecting the 
choice of weapons may not be excluded. But suggesting Korea 
purchase a specific item on a commercial basis outside the FMS 
avenue is certainly extraordinary. We hope that responsible U.S. 
officials restrain themselves from being involved in military 
procurement schemes directly or indirectly so as not to cause 
unnecessary misgivings on this side of the military alliance.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Local vernacular dailies on 4 and 5 
February carry reports, articles, and editorials on new 
Secretary of Defense William Perry's "pressuring" of ROK Defense 
Minister Yi Pyong-tae last December to purchase the reportedly 
"defective" Airborne Self-Protection Jammer (ASPJ) for the 
Korean Fighter Project (KFP) for installation on F-16 fighters 
to be flown by the ROK Air Force. 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO on 4 February carries on page 1 a 
500- word report by Washington-based correspondent Chong Il-hwa 
headlined "Letter Uncovered Confirming U.S. Defense Secretary 
Nominee (Then Deputy Defense Secretary) Pressuring the ROK To 
Buy Arms--HANGUK ILBO Obtains Letter Urging Minister Yi To Buy 
Faulty Radar Jammer, Requests Purchase Outside FMS Channels, 
Contrary to Common Sense, Raises Suspicion of Lobbying for U.S. 
Manufacturers." Featuring a photo copy of Secretary Perry's 
letter to Defense Minister Yi Pyong- tae dated 23 December 1993 
recommending that the ROK purchase the ASPJ via commercial 
channels instead of through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) 
process, the report says, "It was confirmed on 3 February that 
William Perry, U.S. secretary of defense-nominee, sent an 
official letter to Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae to sell the 
ASPJ, the radar jammer for F-16 fighters, to the ROK on 
disadvantageous terms." Citing the letter's file number of 
1-93/004246 and the gist of the contents of the letter, the 
report says, "The letter leads us to suspect that he in fact 
pressured for the procurement of the ASPJ deviating from the 
normal practice in arms deals. In particular, because this 
offer is made under the situation where the shortcomings of the 
ASPJ had been found in a trial flight, suspicion arises that 
Secretary-nominee Perry might have been asked to lobby for ITT 
and Westinghouse, the manufacturers of the ASPJ. Meanwhile a 
U.S. Defense Department official said, 'We understand that the 
ASPJ was found to be short of its expected functions in the U.S. 
Defense Department's test flight in 1992.'" The report cites an 
article by THE NEW YORK TIMES that said the letter would have 
been a problem at Perry's confirmation hearings. 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO on 5 February carries on page 3 an 
800- word editorial entitled "Transparency, Fairness Required 
for Arms Procurement." The editorial notes ongoing "unsmooth" 
U.S.-DPRK nuclear negotiations which could lead to war on the 
Korean peninsula. The editorial then notes the report on the 
deployment of Patriot missiles to the ROK and the "rumor" on 
U.S. pressure to procure the ASPJ, adding, "It is natural that 
these have become hot political pending issues." The editorial 
then notes, "The issue of procurement of the ASPJ leads one to 
suspect that it involved U.S. pressure on us to buy it deviating 
from the normal practice of an arms deal." The editorial then 
goes on to say, "The lobbying by major powers in their endeavor 
to sell their arms should not become a high-handed one hurting 
friendly relations between the countries concerned. If the 
major powers regard our country as a country for dumping their 
arms waste, it should be regarded as a grave matter hurting the 
mutual friendly relations." The editorial then notes the ROK 
Ministry of National Defense (MND) clarification concerning the 
issue that the MND does not regard Secretary Perry's letter as 
intending to pressure the ROK to purchase the ASPJ and that 
"although the ASPJ in question falls short of the standard 
required of the test, it is not defective equipment and that it 
is better equipment than the equipment in current use." The 
editorial then concludes, "The important thing is our attitude. 
We must procure the arms we need at the most reasonable price." 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO on 5 February carries on page 4 a 
600-word article by reporter Ha Chun-u entitled "Why the ROK and 
the United States Differ in Their Opinion--Focus on the 
Procurement Method of Radar Jammers--Commercial Contract With 
U.S. Firms Disadvantageous Pricewise." The article notes that 
attention is focused on the cause and background behind the 
method of procuring the ASPJ since the ROK and the United States 
are showing differences over the method of its purchase. The 
article then notes, "The U.S. operational test of the ASPJ in 
1992 proved some of its functions to be short of the standard 
required of the test. The U.S. military authorities wanted to 
solve this problem but suspended the development project because 
of defense budget cuts." The article notes the disadvantage of 
purchasing the ASPJ through the commercial sales process over 
the purchase through the FMS process. The article then 
concludes, "The MND, therefore, is demanding that the United 
States employ the FMS process as originally agreed. It appears 
that the MND will watch the U.S. attitude until the United 
States makes an official specific proposal for a change in the 
procurement agreement." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO on 5 February carries on page 3 a 
1,200-word report by Washington-based correspondent Chong 
Chin-sok entitled "Defense Secretary's Nomination Ratified 
Without Mentioning His Pressure on Arms Purchase--U.S. Senate 
Keeps Silent in Consideration of National Interest, Arms Sale to 
ROK Creates 20,000 Jobs, the Press Which Criticized Inman Now 
Remains Dumb." The article notes U.S. Senate ratifying on 3 
February U.S. defense secretary nominee as secretary of defense 
without making issue of his reported pressure on the ROK to buy 
ASPJ. The article notes, "The press, which was so critical of 
Inman for a minor thing now remained silent," despite his 
alleged recommendation that ROK buy faulty arms through 
commercial channels. The article says, "The senators must have 
had a good preconception of Perry because he is a person with a 
background of a military-defense industry complex, which leads 
the Arms Services Committee, whose relationship with defense 
industrialists is inevitable, to have a good opinion of him." 
The article notes, "If the ROK buys the ASPJ in question, the 
manufacturers of Westinghouse in Baltimore and ITT in New Jersey 
will have a sudden boom in business creating 20,000 jobs for the 
American people." The article then observes, "The possibility 
of ROK-U.S. friction because of the Perry letter seems remote in 
view of the sensitive nature of the episode." The editorial 
concludes, "Nevertheless, one has to give serious thought to the 
comment of those in the political circles who say, `This episode 
is reported at a time when the security situation on the Korean 
peninsula is delicate, leading us to worry that it could affect 
the security cooperation system between the ROK and the United 
States.'" 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO on 5 February carries on page 3 a 
1,400-word article by reporters Chong Pyong-chin and Son Tae-kyu 
on the position of the MND, the Chongwadae presidential offices, 
and Foreign Ministry on Secretary Perry's letter. The article 
notes the MND position, notes MND's embarrassed position, MND's 
worries that the report on Perry's letter could adversely affect 
the ROK-U.S. military diplomacy and cause the damage to the 
reputation of the F-16 fighters. The article refers to a remark 
by An Pyong-kil, second assistant defense minister, who stated 
on 4 February, `It is not desirable that our relations with the 
United States are affected by this minor problem. New Secretary 
of Defense Perry could fall into a difficult position because of 
this report, and this situation is not desirable for us.' The 
article notes that this position of the MND comes from the MND 
judgment that Perry's letter is not a means of applying pressure 
but advice. The MND thinks that because of the friction between 
the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Administration, "the ROK's 
purchase of the ASPJ became difficult through the FMS process as 
originally agreed, Perry requested our side to buy it through 
commercial sales." Assistant Minister An noted that "ASPJ is 
only part of the electronic device of the airplane, and the MND 
is worried that the report on the shortcoming of some function 
of the device could arouse misunderstanding that there is a 
problem for the new generation fighter project as a whole." The 
article then notes the Chongwadae position, notes its 
embarrassed position, and refers to the comment of a Chongwadae 
official, who says: "We have periodically demanded that the 
United States ensure our purchase of the electronic jammer 
according to the contract. We did so having in mind the 
indemnity in case of a breach of contract. As for the letter 
sent by the then Deputy Defense Secretary Perry, the United 
States might have wanted to leave a ground of informing us of 
the possibility for the purchase of the ASPJ through commercial 
channels in case its fulfillment of the contract becomes 
difficult for failure to get the U.S. Government approval." As 
for the so-called pressure on the ROK to buy the ASPJ through 
commercial channels, the Chongwadae official said, "It is far 
from truth. The United States informed us of its will that it 
will understand it if we think we should purchase through the 
commercial channels the electronic jammer which failed to get 
the U.S. Government approval in its performance test. We have 
reconfirmed our position to the U.S. side that we hope 
intergovernmental procurement will be made according to the F-16 
purchase plan. It is absolutely impossible for us to buy it 
through commercial channels." The article then notes the 
Foreign Ministry official's remarks, who says: "We have no 
knowledge of the Perry letter. If our government regards this 
letter as pressure on us, the Foreign Ministry can consider a 
corresponding diplomatic measure. In view of the fact that 
defense secretary was unanimously approved in the U.S. Senate in 
the ratification hearing, the United States does not seem to 
regard this letter as 'an illegal document intended to exert 
pressure,' the Foreign Ministry, therefore, holds a position 
that we should treat this issue prudently." 
  The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN on 5 February carries on 
page 
3 a 300-word report on the MND position on the Perry letter. It 
quotes An Pyong-kil, second assistant defense minister, as 
saying on 4 February: "We have reconfirmed our position that our 
position of purchasing the ASPJ through the FMS process, rather 
than the commercial sales channel as advised by the U.S. 
Government, and we will continue to maintain this position."

<F P=106> [YONHAP report from Washington] </F>
  [Text] It has been learned on 6 February that the U.S. 
Government has excluded research funds for promoting the 
capacity of the airborne self protection jammer [ASPJ] from the 
budget for fiscal year 1995. Accordingly, this step may 
frustrate the ROK Government's plan to introduce U.S. F-16 
fighter planes for which an enormous part of the national 
treasury has been earmarked. 
  Such a measure virtually violating the ROK-U.S. contract on 
the airborne project was confirmed from the budget bill for 
fiscal year 1995 which was presented by the U.S. Defense 
department that day. 
  The issue regarding contract implementation has already 
caused friction between the ROK and U.S. Governments. However, 
it is likely that this issue will create more stirs in ROK-U.S. 
relations regarding mutual security cooperation as newly 
appointed U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry has been 
learned to have been deeply involved in drawing up the budget. 
  Secretary of Defense Perry, hinting that the U.S. Defense 
Department cannot guarantee the quality of products manufactured 
by ITT, has recently put de facto pressure on the ROK to 
purchase the planes on a civilian level. 
  The budget bill presented by the U.S. Defense Department 
does 
not mention a word on financial support for promoting the ASPJ's 
capabilites. In other words, the U.S. Defense Department has 
withdrawn its previous position of supporting the project to 
promote its capabilities which was conducted under the U.S. 
Navy's supervision, as the project ended in failure. 
Accordingly, the delivery of F-16 fighter planes which was 
slated for this October is expected to be delayed. 
  In connection with the report, the ROK Defense Ministry on 6 
February clarified that "the plan to bring in F-16 fighter 
planes in October will go according to schedule as the ASPJ is 
not an essential part of F-16 fighter planes but auxiliary 
equipment."

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 6 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's 
next-generation fighter program calling for the purchase of F-16 
fighters equipped with an improved radar jammer has hit a snag, 
as the Pentagon has excluded development money for the new 
jammer model from its fiscal 1995 budget. 
  In Seoul the program, known as the Korean Fighter Program 
(KFP), has become a political issue because of suspicions 
surrounding the selection of F-16's as the Korean Air Force's 
next-generation fighter. 
  The Pentagon's action, which apparently violates the 
Seoul-Washington contract on the KFP, was made known on Sunday 
when the Pentagon released its fiscal 1995 budget paper. It is 
expected to cause problems in the security relationship between 
the two governments. 
  Seoul and Washington have been disputing the question of 
fixing the Airborne Self-Protection Jammer (ASPJ) on the F-16 
fighters to be supplied to South Korea over the next several 
years, and new Defense Secretary William Perry was recently 
found to have been involved in the row when he was deputy 
secretary. 
  The Pentagon budget paper does not mention the money needed 
to improve the existing ASPJ model. This is seen as meaning 
that the Pentagon has washed its hands of the ASPJ project, 
seemingly because it failed to turn out an improved model. 
  The suspension of the ASPJ project would delay delivery of 
the F-16 fighters, set to start in October, which would in turn 
pose a stumbling block to the KFP, estimated at 5.4 trillion won 
(6.7 billion U.S. dollars). 
  The Pentagon promised to supply F-16 fighters equipped with 
an improved ASPJ model for the KFP, according to South Korean 
officials here. But Defense Secretary Perry is known to have 
recently pressed Seoul to buy ASPJ devices through commercial 
channels because the Pentagon cannot guarantee the quality of 
the ASPJ developed by ITT Corp. 
  Seoul has urged Washington to keep its promise to fit a new 
model of ASPJ to the F-16 fighters for the KFP and supply the 
fighters for the foreign military sales program, not through 
commercial channels.

<F P=106> [Article by An Song-kyu: "Rumors on Abnormal Atmosphere </F>
Concerning Kim Chong-il's Succession to Power"] 
  [Text] Indications of an abnormal atmosphere regarding the 
power succession in North Korea have recently appeared one after 
another, thus attracting the people's attention. The fact that 
Kim Il-song is personally handling state affairs has been 
verified by visitors to the North. Kim Yong-chu, who returned as 
a Political Bureau member, said that the succession to power 
will not take place until Kim Il-song dies. In addition, as is 
known, a resolution concerning the delay of succession to power 
was adopted at a session of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] 
Political Bureau in October 1993. 
  It has been learned that Reverend Billy Graham, based on 
talks with President Kim Il-song during his recent visit to 
Pyongyang, had an impression that Kim Il-song is personally 
handling the nuclear issue more attentively than before and is 
surely controlling state affairs. 
  According to an intelligence source, during his visit to 
North Korea Rev. Graham presented gifts to President Kim Il-song 
and Kim Chong-il and received a present in return from Kim 
Il-song, but not from Kim Chong-il. When Rev. Graham visited 
Pyongyang in March 1992, he received gifts, including return 
presents, from both Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il. 
  When Rev. Graham visited in 1992, President Kim frequently 
mentioned Kim Chong-il, but he was never mentioned during this 
visit. Moreover, he appeared to be avoiding mentioning Kim 
Chong-il. This information, confirmed by close associates of 
Rev. Graham, evokes speculation that certain abnormalities might 
have been ignited in the succession to power in North Korea. 
  The atmosphere of Rev. Graham's visit to North Korea gives 
an 
impression that the situation has changed from the past and that 
the responsible figure for state affairs is Kim Il-song himself. 
Besides, sources on North Korean affairs confirmed that the 
party Political Bureau meeting in October 1993 adjusted the 
schedule of Kim Chong-il's succession to power. 
  A foreign news report noted that Kim Yong-chu -- who at one 
time, it was learned, was nominated as successor to Kim Il-song 
but disappeared from the power structure then returned to the 
Political Bureau last year, said in a conversation with 
diplomats from the third world that "Kim Chong-il will retain 
the posts of secretary of the Workers' Party and supreme 
commander of the People's Army until Kim Il-song dies." His 
remarks mean Kim Chong-il's early succession to power will be 
denied and suggest that something abnormal is occurring in the 
succession to power. 
  Relevant officials observe that such a trend remarkably 
differs from the remarks made by Kim Il-song in an interview 
with THE WASHINGTON TIMES on 12 April 1992, when he said: 
"Secretary Kim Chong-il is controlling the overall national 
administration." 
  However, phenomena totally denying such observations have 
been published by the North Korean press and mass media. 
  Since the beginning of this year, the North Korean press 
has intensified its idolization campaign of Kim Chong-il, which 
has even surpassed the idolization campaign of Kim Il-song. In 
addition, Kim Il-song's New Year address, which has been 
repeatedly broadcast on several occasions each year in the past, 
was repeated only once this year. Thus, broadcasts related to 
Kim Il-song have been reduced. On the contrary, intelligence 
organizations have noted that the propaganda campaign on Kim 
Chong-il's greatness and events inspiring loyalty to Kim 
Chong-il have increased. 
  Concerning such two contradictory trends, relevant 
high-ranking government officials and experts in North Korean 
affairs cautiously put forward a hypothesis that "the schedule 
of power succession is being readjusted and early succession 
will be delayed." 
  They said: It is apparent that a session of the North Korean 
Workers' Party Political Bureau on 18 October 1993 adopted a 
resolution that Kim Chong-il temporarily retreat from the seat 
of power and Kim Il-song again control the national 
administration. 
  The intensive changes in the power structure, which took 
place after the Supreme People's Assembly conference in December 
1993, have aroused constant speculation concerning the change in 
Kim Chong-il's position. 
  This speculation is based on the fact that Kim Yong-chu has 
returned to power as a Political Bureau member and vice 
president; Kim Yong-sun, secretary of the Workers' Party in 
charge of South Korean affairs and close associate of Kim 
Chong-il, was relieved from the post; and Kim Tal-hyon, vice 
premier and chairman of the State Planning Commission, was 
reassigned to a manager of a vinalon enterprise. 
  Viewing this, it is observed the present atmosphere 
indicates 
that by reshuffling his close associates, Kim Chong-il was 
called to account for handling the national administration and 
his early succession to power, which has been constantly raised 
in the past, has become void. 
  In view of the characteristics in the power structure within 
the North Korean system, adjustment of the schedule of power 
succession is not meant to basically shake the structure of 
succession and power organization, but to make Kim Il-song 
appear as the seat of power to handle overall state affairs for 
the time being. As a result, it is likely that even after Kim 
Chong-il's retreat from the present position of power, a 
propaganda campaign for him will be intensified in the future, 
thus showing dual trends.

  [Text] It was learned on 6 February that North Korea 
concluded a contract with the former Soviet Union to buy 100 
MiG-29 jets by the end of the eighties and succeeded in the 
assembly-production of MiG-29 in 1992. 
  A government intelligence official revealed that "it has 
been 
confirmed that, by using the parts and facilities North Korea 
introduced from the former Soviet Union in 1991, North Korea 
succeeded in assembly-production of two MiG-29 jets at the 
Panghyon plant." MiG-29 jets are Russia's ultramodern fighters 
that are recognized as being superior to U.S. F-16's which the 
ROK Air Force is expected to import for its Korean Fighter 
Program. 
  North Korea's assembly-production success draws public 
attention, because this means that the technology of North 
Korea's arms industry has surpassed expectations. 
  Another high-level government intelligence official said 
that 
"the government is keeping close watching over North Korea's 
possible production and introduction of more MiG-29 jets." 
North Korea began introducing MiG-29 jets from the former 
Soviet Union in the mid-eighties and now possesses approximately 
20 MiG-29 jets.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 7 (YONHAP) -- A recent North Korean 
defector said here on Monday that he chose to escape the North 
because he couldn't stand worsening food conditions and tight 
surveillance of him there. 
  Chong Ki-hae, age 52, told a press conference that food 
rations in the North had consisted mainly of soy beans and corns 
mixed with those grains reserved for livestock feeds until early 
last year. 
  "Beginning last May, however, even these ceased to be 
rationed. Our family had to live on potatoes alone in the past 
six months," Chong said. 
  The defector, a repatriate from Japan, said he had earned 
176 
North Korean won a month as a work team head at the Unhung mine 
machinery plant in Yanggang Province. He said that only about 
60 percent of the wage had actually been paid, with which, he 
said, it was extremely difficult to support his family. Because 
of his being a repatriate, Chong said, he had been placed under 
close surveillance by public security authorities for 30-odd 
years since his repatriation from Japan in June 1960. 
  "Like me, all other repatriates had chosen to move to North 
Korea at sugar-coated promises by North Korea," Chong said. 
"They are leading miserable lives under the watchful eyes of the 
security authorities." 
  The defector said he crossed the Tuman River into China on 
Dec. 30 last year and stayed in Yanji for about 20 days before 
reaching Pusan. He declined to say how he could come to South 
Korea. Chong said his wife and five children are staying in 
North Korea, adding that his father was born at Yongchon near 
Taegu in South Korea.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 7 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean Community 
Center in Ho Chi Minh City is expected to be turned over to 
Koreans, resolving the education problem for children of Korean 
expatriates and diplomats, a Foreign Ministry official said 
Sunday. 
  The Korean Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City has been 
seeking the return of the 162-pyong (534.6-square-meter) 
two-floor community building that was used as a Korean school 
and Taekwondo gym until the withdrawal of Korean troops in 1975, 
when Saigon fell to North Vietnamese Forces. 
  Ho Chi Minh City officials have pledged that they will soon 
return the building, currently used as an English-language 
institute, the official said. 
  An estimated 600 Koreans including diplomats and expatriates 
are in Vietnam: If the building becomes a Korean school as 
before, their children's education problem will be resolved to 
some extent, he added. 
  As there are no Korean schools in Vietnam, Korean students 
currently attend nearby Malaysian or Singaporean international 
colleges and French or Australian primary schools.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 7 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam, 
declaring that violent demonstrations are the greatest enemy of 
democracy, said Monday they cannot be justified under any 
circumstances. 
  "Violent demonstrations, especially against policemen who 
are 
guarding the nation, democracy, and law and order, are 
unacceptable," the president said on receiving a new year's 
policy report from Seoul City Mayor Kim Won-chong. 
  The home affairs minister and the national police 
administrator must tackle violent demonstrations with firm 
determination, Kim said, adding that he will ask them to take 
responsibility if they fail to do so. 
  The president's comment on demonstrations came a few days 
after thousands of farmers and student sympathizers staged a 
violent protest in the heart of Seoul against the opening of the 
domestic rice market to imports under the Uruguay Round of trade 
negotiations. 
  Kim said his administration, elected by a majority of the 
people through democratic means, is different from the 
authoritarian governments of the past. 
  Violent anti-government demonstrations, therefore, cannot be 
justified under any circumstances, he said. 
  Now is the time for the country to establish a 
"demonstration 
culture," or a correct and democratic way of advancing different 
opinions.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 7 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam, 
convinced that the success or failure of his administration 
depends on political reform and "an election revolution," plans 
to bring about drastic changes as soon as the National Assembly 
adopts political legislation at its extraordinary session in 
February. Pending in the National Assembly are political reform 
bills on unified elections, political fund-raising and local 
autonomous bodies. 
  As part of the reforms, President Kim hopes to have the 
political fund-raising law revised and passed by the National 
Assembly so as to halt under-the-table contributions and other 
illegal funding channels. 
  The current law on political fund-raising has been all but 
dead since Kim's civilian administration was launched last 
February, with the president declaring that he would receive no 
money from political funds. 
  One senior Chongwadae [presidential offices] official on 
Sunday acknowledged the persistent skepticism regarding the 
practicality of revising the political fund-raising bill as "the 
proposed revision is idealistic." 
  "But those who voice doubt about the revised bill are the 
ones who do not know the will and determination of President Kim 
for political reform," the official said, adding that the flow 
of "all black money" will be shut off in the future. 
  The government will help carry out the current elections for 
heads of the nation's agricultural, fishery and livestock 
cooperatives in a fair and correct manner. 
  It hopes to apply the revised election law beginning with 
by- 
elections for local councils that are scheduled for this year, 
the official said. 
  He said the government will then employ its power to hold 
fair and clean elections for chiefs of local autonomous 
governing bodies and polls for provincial and city councils in 
1995. 
  President Kim has said that he will carry out political 
reform at any cost, even if it means that all National Assembly 
representatives lose their seats for violating the election law, 
the official added. 
  The president also believes that political reform should be 
realized not in stages but in a drastic manner, he said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Military Morale Cannot Be Regarded Idly"] </F>
  [Summary] A survey conducted by the Agency of Defense 
Development gives a shocking report that 87 percent of military- 
related personnel regard their social status as lower-middle 
class and that 56.1 percent reported they would dissuade their 
children from becoming professional soldiers. 
  "Military morale is at its lowest," is illustrated by the 
fact that 71.5 percent of the respondents said their welfare was 
dissatisfactory. 
  National Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae has also stressed the 
enhancement of military morale on various occasions. The Army 
can complete its missions only when high military morale is 
added to strong combat capabilities and outstanding strategy and 
equipment. 
  With the end of the cold war, the world is turning toward 
peace, reconciliation, and cooperation. The "economic war," 
however, is becoming fierce. We cannot win the economic war 
without a security posture based on strong combat capabilities. 
  The situation on the Korean peninsula, where the cold war 
continues, demands more emphasis on security posture. 
Therefore, it is time for our people to stand in front to 
recognize the importance of security posture and pay more 
attention to the enhancement of military morale.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Is There Really No Problem in Security </F>
Posture?"] 
  [Summary] Misgivings due to prevailing war scenarios on 
the Korean peninsula are being amplified by the analysis by the 
U.S. Defense Department that North Korea already possesses 
nuclear weapons and has developed transportation devices. The 
situation has become even worse with North Korea's forward 
disposition and the U.S. Pyongyang occupation strategy. We want 
to ask the government and the Army if we really need to worry 
about our security, and if we would be able to deter and ease 
the worst possible situation. 
  The best combat capability is deterrence. Therefore, our 
government should have confidence in the following five areas: 
  First, strengthened acquisition and analysis capability of 
intelligence concerning North Korean affairs. The North Korean 
nuclear issue is not an issue of the United States or Japan. 
  Second, military morale. The recent survey showing that our 
soldiers do not have self-confidence in their profession could 
result in a crisis. 
  Third, establishment of a reliable military image, that is, 
to clear up all doubts regarding arms purchase irregularities. 
  Fourth, answer doubts concerning the arms system, including 
the jamming system of the F-16's and other Yulgok projects. 
  Fifth, establishment of a unified reunification policy and a 
consistent security policy.

headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 6 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
lays bare the sinister intention of the U.S. military and 
hardline conservative forces in increasing their military forces 
in and around South Korea, crying over "missile threat" and 
"export of missiles" by the DPRK while kicking up a dust over 
its fictitious "nuclear issue". 
  "Missile threat" and "export of missiles" by the DPRK is a 
false propaganda invented by those bent on stifling it by 
military force, the analyst says, and goes on: 
  The U.S. bellicose quarters dislike the solution of the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and are trying to gratify 
their wild ambition for aggression on the DPRK at whatever cost. 
The U.S. hardline conservative forces are scheming to deploy 
Patriot missiles in South Korea and build a "theatre missile 
defence system" together with Japan on the pretext of the DPRK's 
"nuclear and missile threat". This is aimed at maintaining and 
strengthening their military position which is in danger in 
northeast Asia owing to the economic and military aggrandizement 
of Japan and at tightening control on Japan and South Korea 
under the cloak of "security". 
  As for the DPRK's defence power, it is self-defensive and 
the 
DPRK is a peaceloving state. 
  Missile threat is presented not by the DPRK but by the 
United 
States which is working to maintain and strengthen their 
military position in Northeast Asia. 
  The U.S. hardline conservative forces must not miscalculate 
the strength of the DPRK. 
  If they increase their military forces and dare choose to 
use 
strength, we will make a corresponding choice.

<F P=106> ["United States' Perfidy Is Intolerable" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 4 (KCNA) -- If the United 
States, breaking its promise to us, persists in the 
anti-socialist and anti-DPRK moves contradictory to the 
DPRK-U.S. joint statement, the DPRK will no longer be bound to 
the promise it has made to the United States, declares MINJU 
CHOSON in a commentary today. 
  It warns that the DPRK will counter hard line with hard line 
and its tough stance will be clearly shown in practice rather 
than in words. 
  Commenting on the creation by the United States of a grave 
crisis that may lead the process of the solution of the nuclear 
issue on the Korean peninsula to a collapse, the analyst says: 
  Officially urging the DPRK to accept the unjustifiable 
demand 
of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for a 
comprehensive inspection, the United States is threatening 
that unless the demand is accepted it will not hold talks with 
the DPRK but take "sanctions". Worse still, they are even 
crying for a "special inspection" of the DPRK's two military 
sites which have nothing to do with nuclear activities. 
  The U.S. official quarters are blaring that another 
military rehearsal targeted against the DPRK will be staged, if 
the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises are suspended this 
year, that it would take place in other region if not in South 
Korea. 
  And the U.S. hardline conservative forces are promoting in 
full scale the supply of Patriot missils to the U.S. troops 
present in South Korea under the pretext of coping with the 
DPRK's "missile attack." 
  The U.S. Administration hurriedly dispatched the director of 
the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to South Korea at 
the beginning of the new year to have a confab for "the 
intensification of intelligence against North Korea" and is 
operating in South Korea an "intelligence supporting team" 
composed of specialists of the CIA and the Defence Intelligence 
Agency. This clearly indicates that the new war provocation 
moves of the United States against the DPRK have reached a 
full-scale stage. 
  All the facts clearly prove that the United States has no 
intention at all to solve the nuclear issue of the Korean 
peninsula peacefully and is still pursuing the purpose of 
strangling the DPRK and destroying socialism with strength at 
whatever cost. 
  The United States should ponder over the matter, clearly 
understanding that with nothing can it frighten the Korean 
people.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 5 (KCNA) -- If the United States 
dare provoke a war against the DPRK, not minding the strong 
denunciation at home and abroad, it will suffer a more tragic 
and grave defeat than in the past Korean war, in which it was 
humbled and bruised all over, warns MINJU CHOSON in a commentary 
today. 
  The analyst says: 
  With the insidious intention to unleash a new war in Korea, 
the United States is stepping up arms buildup in and around 
South Korea and engaging itself in military espionage, watching 
for a chance of surprise strike at the DPRK. 
  Military moves and anti-DPRK rows of the U.S. war-thirsty 
quarters that have become all the more undisguised entering the 
new year, make it self-evident that, although the United States 
has run the whole gamut of tricks under the motto of "peace on 
the Korean peninsula" and "peaceful negotiations", they are, in 
essence, intended to gain time for the completion of war 
preparations and it seeks to threaten and stifle the DPRK with 
arms at whatever cost. 
  No military pressure and strong arm can ever work on the 
Korean people who have Comrade Kim Chong-il, an ever-victorious 
iron-willed brilliant commander, as the supreme commander, with 
the leader, the party and the masses united in one mind. 
  Our people who know of the vulnerability of the United 
States 
better than anyone else and has the experience of a fight with 
it for three years regard it not as a "super power" but as a 
bluffing paper tiger.

  [Text] According to a report, the U.S. State Department, 
in its annual report on the human-rights situation in the world, 
has raved absurdly as if the citizens in our country are not 
ensured with even basic human rights while enumerating on 
human-rights conditions in various countries. This is shameless 
interference in our country's domestic affairs and intolerable 
debasement of the popular mass-centered socialist system of our 
own style. 
  Our government of the Republic, which sets up as a firm 
policy to value the people and respect the people's rights, 
practically ensures the true sense of freedom and rights for all 
citizens and reliably guarantees a bountiful and happy life for 
them. The policy of the popular masses-centered socialism of 
our own style which embodies the chuche idea is the true human 
rights policy that respects and guarantees everyone's human 
rights to the maximum. 
  The fact that the United States, distorting a stern reality, 
comes out with the rumor on so-called human rights violations in 
North Korea is nothing but a cunning scheme aimed at staining 
the image of our Republic internationally so as to isolate 
[korip] us. This clearly shows that the United States is 
strengthening propaganda maneuvers in every way to lay an 
artificial obstacle in way of the DPRK-U.S. talks for 
fundamentally resolving the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula, to heighten the tension on the Korean peninsula to 
the extreme, and to base the Republic. 
  In fact, speaking of the chieftain of human rights 
violations 
and the barren land of human rights, the United States and South 
Korea are the ones. It is ridiculous for the United States to 
babble about our nonexistent human rights issue without uttering 
a word on this. If the United States thinks it can damage the 
superiority and the invincible cause of the popular 
masses-centered socialism of our own style with this nonsense, 
it is a miscalculation. 
  The United States must immediately give up the 
anti-Republic, 
anti-socialist strategic propaganda maneuvers, such as our 
so-called human rights issue, the byproduct of the U.S. 
reactionary strategy.

KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 5 (KCNA) -- The U.S. State 
Department in its "Annual Report on the Human Rights Situation 
in the World", absurdly alleged that the basic human rights of 
the citizens are not guaranteed in the DPRK, according to 
reports. 
  This is a brazen interference in the internal affairs of our 
country and an intolerable insult to the socialist system of our 
style centering on the popular masses. 
  The DPRK Government, which regards it as its immovable 
policy to value man and respect his rights, substantially 
provides genuine freedom and rights to all citizens and 
creditably ensures their abundant and happy life. 
  The United States came out with the fiction of "violation of 
human rights in North Korea", blatantly distorting the stark 
reality. This is a crafty ruse to impair the image of our 
republic and isolate us. 
  This clearly proves that the United States is intensifying 
the propaganda offensive in every way to slander our republic, 
while laying artificial hurdles in the way of the DPRK-USA talks 
for a fundamental solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula and rendering the situation extremely strained. 
  If one wants to talk about the chief violator of human 
rights and the barren land of human rights, he must cite the 
United States and South Korea. 
  If the United States, keeping silent about this, attempts to 
decry the advantages and invincible might of the socialist 
system of our style centering on the popular masses with a 
silly talk, it is a mistake. 
  The United States must immediately stop its anti-DPRK and 
anti-socialist propaganda over the "human rights issue" of the 
DPRK, a disgusting product of its reactionary strategy.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Foolish Maneuver Aimed at </F>
Ideological Disintegration"] 
  [Text] As it has already been reported, the U.S. Senate 
passed a bill on the initiation of Radio Free Asia. Regarding 
this, a spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry exposed the U.S. 
intentions behind the initiation of Radio Free Asia in his 
answer to the question raised by a reporter from the Korean 
Central Broadcasting Committee and strongly demanded its 
cancellation. 
  This is a clear expression of our people's unshakable will 
to 
stop the infiltration of U.S. ideology and culture, and to 
protect our nation's sovereignty. 
  It goes without saying that Radio Free Asia which the United 
States is trying to initiate is targeting our Republic and other 
Asian socialist countries. A byproduct of anti-socialist, 
anti-Republic strategic maneuvers, the U.S. Senate's passage of 
the bill on initiating Radio Free Asia is an intolerable 
interference into the internal affairs of our country and other 
Asian countries and a hostile, criminal act against them [uri 
narawa tarun asia naraduredaehan chamulsu omnun naejonggansobigo 
choktaejogin pomjoehaengwi imnida]. 
  As is known, the United States turned its spearhead of 
attack 
to the Asian region in recent years following the waning of the 
Cold War era from the international arena and the frustration of 
socialism in some countries. The reason lies in the fact that 
there are numerous important strategic points, and abundant 
manpower and resources in the Asian region. With rapidly 
growing economies, many countries in this region oppose 
domination and interference by outside forces, and are 
constantly walking along the road of independence. 
  The United States has declared the Asian Pacific region as a 
region of vital importance and interest in the 21st century, and 
is regarding our Republic and other Asian socialist countries as 
the stumbling blocks to the expansion of its sphere of 
domination. Based on this notion, the United States has focused 
its world strategy on the Asian region and attempted to set up 
Radio Free Asia, a tool for ideological and cultural 
infiltration, in addition to its military threat. 
  Every country has its unique tradition and culture, and, 
accordingly, implements an independent broadcast policy in 
conformity with its people's taste and customs. However, the 
United States attempts to paralyze [mabi] the Asian peoples' 
ideological consciousness and create social chaos and disorder 
by spreading the U.S. life style and culture so as to demolish 
the Asian countries from within. Where else in the world could 
there be such a shameless and brigandish interference in 
internal affairs! 
  The true intention of the United States in initiating Radio 
Free Asia is to infuse the so-called U.S.-style democratic 
values and the toxin of bourgeois ideology into our country and 
other Asian countries in order to crush [apsal] socialism in 
this region and demolish the independent governments there from 
within. However, this is a foolish and indiscreet act. 
  The United States was able to effectively use all sorts of 
machination and propaganda with Radio Free Europe, under the 
command of the Central Intelligence Agency, to bring about the 
cave in and return to capitalism of former socialist countries 
in another region, but it will far from work with our country. 
  We have the chuche idea, the great guiding ideology of the 
era of independence, the spirit of independence, and our-style 
of life. Clearly acknowledging the fact from their life 
experience that only socialism can provide genuine freedom and 
rights and ensure their abundant and happy life, our people 
regard the chuche socialism, in which the leader, the party, and 
the masses are wholeheartedly united, as their life and lifeline. 
  If the United States thinks it can create the false image 
among our people and perpetrate social chaos and disorder with 
Radio Free Asia so as to topple the might of the socialism of 
our own style as it did in eastern Europe, it is grossly 
miscalculating. Many Asian countries strongly denounce the U.S. 
maneuvers to start broadcasting Radio Free Asia as interference 
into their internal affairs and a violation of the rules of 
international relations, and express their will to protect their 
tradition, culture, and consciousness from Yankee culture. 
  If the United States initiates Radio Free Asia despite the 
consistent opposition and rejection of the people of Asian 
countries, it will gain nothing from it. 
  The United States should immediately stop the game of 
initiating Radio Free Asia, a propaganda and machination 
organization aimed at ideologically disintegrating our country 
and other Asian countries. 
  The Asian people, including our people, will resolutely 
confront the U.S. ideological and cultural infiltration, and the 
rascals' anti-socialist, anti-Republic strategic maneuvers will 
not be able to avoid failure.

headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 5 (KCNA) -- The U.S. 
imperialists staged a long-distance bombing exercise targeted 
against the northern half of Korea in the skies above Yongwol 
and Pyongchang, South Korea, on February 3, by setting in-motion 
formations of U.S. overseas-based electronic jamming planes, 
pursuit-assault planes and VTOL [vertical takeoff and landing] 
planes, according to military sources. 
  On the same day, the South Korean puppets swiftly deployed 
some 20 tanks and about 300 armed bandits to Ogum-ri from 
Manu-ri, Paju County, Kyonggi Province, and brought 
large-calibre guns into the demilitarized zone along the 
Military Demarcation Line from Kajon-ri, Inje County, South 
Korean Kangwon Province. 
  The desperate military exercises against the northern malf 
of 
Korea fully show the aggressive and bellicose nature of the U.S. 
imperialists and the South Korean puppets.

  [Text] According to a military source, the South Korean 
puppets conducted land attack operation exercises and fired guns 
near the Military Demarcation Line in the Demilitarized Zone, in 
front of us, on 4 February. 
  The puppet Army's mobile tank groups deployed in Chomwon-ri, 
Paju County, Kyonggi Province, South Korea frantically conducted 
land attack operation exercises aimed at the northward invasion 
on that day in cooperation with the mechanized infantry outfits. 
Large- caliber artillery units of the puppet Army moved in 
Kajon-ri, Imje County, Kangwon Province, South Korea and assumed 
a firing position against our side, agitating us extremely. 
  On the same day, the armed rascals of the puppet Army 
occupied battle positions in Nosang-ri, Ogum-ri, and Yongsan-ri 
in Paju County and fired at random some 1,000 shots of 
large-caliber machine guns and automatic rifles. 
  Meanwhile, some 10 armed helicopters and transport 
helicopters of the puppet Army moved out in the skies above 
Yonchon and Pochon of Kyonggi Province and Chorwon County of 
Kangwon Province, South Korea, and frantically conducted 
exercises of supporting land units, dropping special attack 
corps, and supplying operation equipment in the air, while 
flying at low and very low altitudes. 
  All these facts prove that the South Korean puppets are 
running toward confrontation and war and running counter to 
peace and detente.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Civilian Warmongers Must Be </F>
Overthrown"] 
  [Text] Recently the South Korean puppets have been 
frantically running wild with maneuvers of a Northward war of 
aggression more than ever before, thus further aggravating 
tension. 
  According to a military source, the puppet Army's tank 
corps, 
which was deployed in areas around Chomwon-ri, Paju County, 
Kyonggi Province, near the Demilitarized Zone of the Military 
Demarcation Line on 4 February, staged a ground offensive 
operation exercise intended for Northward aggression under 
coordination between mechanized units and infantry troops. In 
addition, the puppet Army's large-caliber gun troops, which 
advanced to the area in Kajon-ri, Imje County, Kangwon Province 
in South Korea, took a posture of firing at our side, thus 
gravely irritating us. 
  That day, armed hooligans of the puppet Army, who occupied 
combat positions in areas around Nosang-ri, Ogum-ri and 
Yongsan-ri in Paju County, fired at random more than 1,000 
bullets of large-caliber machine guns and automatic rifles, thus 
reeking of gunpowder. In addition, more than 10 armed 
helicopters and transportation helicopters of the puppet Army, 
which were mobilized in the air above Yonchon and Pochon in 
Kyonggi Province and Chupa-ri, Chorwon County in South Korean 
Kangwon Province, staged exercises of supporting ground troops, 
dropping special units and transporting operational equipment, 
while making low-altitude and super low-altitude flights. 
  In parallel with exercises of a Northward war of aggression, 
the puppets are running amok with arms buildup maneuvers. It is 
a fact already exposed to the public that the puppets are 
scheming to bring Patriot missiles to South Korea in collusion 
with the United States. In addition, the puppets recently 
decided to buy three more German-made submarines. 
  Bellicose and violent remarks, such as preparations for a 
combat posture, fostering combat capabilities and so forth, were 
put forward during the recent conference of the puppet Marine 
Corps commanders. 
  War exercises and arms buildup maneuvers, which have been 
further strengthened in South Korea, clearly show how 
frantically the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is running amok with 
maneuvers of preparations for a Northward war of aggression. 
The puppets justify their arms buildup and war exercises by 
saying they were prompted by the threat of someone else. 
However, this is a brazen-faced sophism. 
  The danger of war on the Korean peninsula comes from the 
South, not from the North, therefore, the one who is subject to 
threat is not South Korea, but our Republic. The United States 
and South Korean puppets always keep in combat posture tens of 
thousands of U.S. Forces in South Korea, who are armed with 
modern war equipment, and nearly 1 million of the puppet Army. 
They are also scheming to bring dark, dangerous clouds of war by 
attempting to stage, by all means, large-scale exercises of 
Northward aggression, including the Team Spirit joint military 
exercise. 
  Moreover, the United States has recently forced brigandish 
full-scope inspection [kangdojogin chonmyon sachal] on us on the 
pretext of our nonexistent nuclear problem. By designating even 
a deadline, the United States assumed a final notice-like 
attitude [choehu tongchopsiguro naoda] by raving about sanctions 
and the like. 
  Despite this fact, the puppets made gibberish about someone 
else's threat and so forth. This is no more than a sophism 
designed to mislead public opinion and to justify their 
adventurous maneuvers of Northward aggression. 
  All fellow countrymen in the North, the South, and overseas, 
who designated this year as the year of great national unity, 
are hoping that a breakthrough is opened for reconciliation and 
unity in conformity with the nation's enhanced zeal for 
reunification. Therefore, the North and the South should discard 
war exercises and arms buildup that go counter to the nation's 
aspiration and demand. 
  As long as war maneuvers continue, reconciliation and unity 
between the North and the South cannot be achieved nor can peace 
and reunification of the nation be realized. Instead, tensions 
will be aggravated and only confrontation and war will be 
brought about. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is frantically running amok 
with maneuvers of a Northward war of aggression to attack fellow 
countrymen in collusion with outside forces. This is indeed an 
intolerable antinational and antireunification criminal act that 
challenges fellow countrymen's aspiration to reunification, 
which goes against the nation's reconciliation and unity, and 
which leads the situation to the brink of war. 
  It became clearer that the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime, which 
is running amok with war maneuvers against fellow countrymen 
under a veil of a civilian government, is the separatist regime 
opposing reunification and a group of national traitors who 
pursue only confrontation and war. 
  As long as the Kim Yong-sam group, which is not interested 
in 
peace, reunification, and fellow countrymen; remains in power, 
our nation cannot avoid suffering disaster of nuclear war. There 
is nothing to increase hope and expect from the traitorous Kim 
Yong-sam regime. 
  It is natural for the South Korean people to call for 
overthrowing the civilian warmongers. The South Korean people, 
who want the nation's reconciliation and unity and who aspire to 
peace and reunification, absolutely will not pardon the Kim 
Yong-sam clique, a group of warmongers.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 5 (KCNA) -- What the South 
Korean puppet minister of the unification board said in regard 
to the January 31 statement of a spokesman for the Foreign 
Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea concerning 
the U.S. perfidious act is nothing but a balderdash of a stooge 
aimed at embellishing the U.S. military threat to the DPRK and 
its deliberate moves to increase tension, says NODONG SINMUN 
today. 
  Feeling uneasy about the statement, he dared to charge the 
DPRK with its "threat to the United States" and "menace to South 
Korea," the analyst says, and continues: 
  This is a preposterous sophism reminding us of a thief 
crying 
"stop thief!" 
  Who really resorts to threat and menace and who is subjected 
to them on the Korean peninsula? 
  It is the United States that has thrown off the promise it 
had made at DPRK-U.S. contacts like a pair of old shoes and 
urged the DPRK to accept the demand for an overall inspection 
raised by the secretariat of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency, which is tantamount to its return to the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty, while pressing ultimatum-style demand 
to the DPRK, threatening it with "sanctions" after setting a 
deadline. 
  No matter how loudly those who are trying to threaten and 
overpower the DPRK with strength may charge it with "threat" and 
"menace," nobody will be deceived by them. 
  The "minister of the unification board" might have been 
bribed by the United States, the master of the South Korean 
puppets. But his sophistry has sparked off the anger of the 
Korean nation. 
  The South Korean people hit the nail on the head when they 
labeled the South Korean "unification board" as a "board of 
division and confrontation." If the puppets persistently seek 
a nuclear war against the fellow countrymen in the North in 
league with outside forces, letting loose belligerent outbursts 
and playing with fire, while tailing behind the United States, 
it would be none other than the provocateurs and warmaniacs who 
would be burnt in the flame. 
  The puppets must clearly see the situation and stop running 
riot.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "The Antidemocratic Kim Yong-sam Puppet </F>
Regime Must Be Overthrown"] 
  [Text] South Korean youth, students, and people of various 
classes and strata are insisting on overthrowing the Kim 
Yong-sam regime, denouncing it as an antidemocratic fascist 
regime. 
  This is based on the serious lesson that it is impossible to 
achieve independence, democracy, or reunification with the Kim 
Yong-sam traitorous clique, which is committing treacheries to 
the country and the nation more viciously than any preceding 
regime by deceiving and disgracing the masses and drumming up 
civilian and reform policies, as it is. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet regime is a more antidemocratic 
fascist dictatorial one than any of the successive military 
dictatorial regimes. 
  Although he is advertising civilian and reform policies, 
traitor Kim Yong-sam has only brought a greater disaster to the 
people by conducting the civilian fascist repressive politics, 
which is more vicious than the military fascist dictatorship of 
the Fifth and Sixth Republics. The Kim Yong-sam group's fascist 
nature is not inferior to and rather goes beyond that of any 
preceding military fascist dictator. It is the most malicious 
and vicious. 
  The so-called civilian government of South Korea cannot 
coexist with the civilian politics. It follows the legal 
grounds of the preceding military fascist rule as they are. 
  It is traitor Kim Yong-sam that promised to amend the 
notorious National Security Law during the election campaign and 
said on the following day of his inauguration that it was too 
early to amend it. 
  Not a single phrase of the notorious National Security Law 
has been changed, and the unchanged law plays the role of the 
civilian government's fascist stick being used in repressing the 
people. 
  The Kim Il-song group has not only maintained the bodies 
organized under the previous military fascist dictatorship to 
repress the people but also strengthened their functions and 
increased their capacities drastically. 
  Yielding under the people's protest, the fascist clique was 
talking about the reduction of the Agency for National Security 
Planning [NSP], the place of origin of fascist oppression and 
infringement of human rights in South Korea. In fact, however, 
only some NSP figures' positions have been changed, and rather 
strengthened the agency's function by establishing a new bureau 
in charge of planning strategies on the North. 
  The demonstration-quelling task force unit of the puppet 
police, which is being denounced as a fascist stick, a culprit 
of the ruling forces, was reinforced with as many as about 
17,000 new men. Special detective teams have been established in 
the puppet police administration of each city and province. The 
length of sticks carried by policemen is longer than that of 
ones carried by policemen in the previous dictatorial regime. 
  Moreover, the Kim Yong-sam fascist clique announced its 
plan to sharply increase the budget for puppet police stations 
and police boxes across the country annually to suppress the 
people. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet regime has maintained and reinforced 
the fascist laws and repressive tools made by the preceding 
military dictatorial regimes, pursuing a vicious fascist 
dictatorial rule against the people. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is exasperatingly brandishing 
a sword of civilian fascist dictatorship against the struggle 
and march of the South Korean people and students who call for 
independence, democracy, reunification, and the rights to live, 
debasing it as an illegal violent riot and a collective egoism. 
  The civilian fascist dictatorial maniac ruthlessly cracked 
down with a 100,000-strong police force on the struggle of the 
citizens and students urging the investigation into the Kwangju 
massacre, punishment of the murderers which was waged on the 13 
anniversary of incident of the Kwangju popular uprising, thus 
leaving the injured three times more than the Sixth Republic did. 
  Branding the South Korean Federation of General Student 
Councils [Hanchongnyon]--a successor of the National Council of 
Student Representatives [Chondaehyop] that set sail to realize 
independence, democracy, and reunification--as an illegal group 
benefiting the enemy, the Kim yong-sam fascist clique announced 
a emergency state to ruin its inauguration ceremony and brutally 
suppressed it by mobilizing some 190-company riot police troops. 
  Every university in South Korea, including Yonsei and Korea, 
is being constantly searched by the civilian fascist 
authorities. The theaters of the students' struggle have been 
stained with blood and many patriotic students were arrested and 
put behind the bars. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet traitor has frozen workers' wage by 
shifting blame onto them for the economic crisis in South Korea 
which is already in tatters. Furthermore, it has gone so far as 
to brutally obstruct workers' strikes calling for the rights to 
exist, including the basic wage hike, by invoking the emergency 
arbitration power which the preceding dictators did not even 
dare to provoke. 
  The civilian fascist dictators not only intensify its 
suppression on patriotic movement organizations but also set up 
government-controlled movement organizations and infiltrated 
members of the Agency for National Security Planning into 
progressive movement organizations. In this way, it is 
persistently resorting to cunning maneuvers to reform 
[kaeryanghwa] the South Korean mass movements and plunge them 
into pure civic movements. 
  Its antipopular and antidemocratic fascist repressive rule 
is 
the most crafty, vicious and brutal despotism of a civilian 
fascist outstripping the preceding military fascist regimes. 
  It is traitor Kim Yong-sam who is the most ruthless, 
barbarous, fascist, dictatorial maniac who would not hesitate to 
slay all the South Korean people if it is for gratifying his 
greed for power. 
  It is a matter of course that the South Korean people and 
students strongly call for the removal of the Kim Yong-sam 
puppet regime, branding it as the most atrocious, vicious 
civilian fascist regime combined with both military and civilian 
dictatorship. 
  Only when the Kim Yong-sam treacherous regime is removed and 
a genuine democratic independent regime is established in South 
Korea, independence, democracy, and reunification which the 
people aspire to could be realized.

headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 5 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
says that Kim Yong-sam the fascist dictator wearing the 
"civilian" mask must be removed. 
  The author of the article says: 
  His puppet regime is a more truculent, anti-democratic 
fascist dictatorial one than any of the successive military 
dictatorial regimes. 
  Though the Kim Yong-sam fascist clique is wearing the 
"civilian" veil, it is, in actuality, relentlessly challenging 
the South Korean people's desire for independence, democracy and 
reunification with its cruel fascist repressive rule as the 
successive military dictators did. 
  It, first of all, has kept intact all the fascist legal and 
institutional ruling systems of the preceding military fascist 
dictatorial regimes, enhanced their function and drastically 
reinforced them. 
  The "civilian" fascists are harshly suppressing the 
patriotic 
forces calling for independence and democracy in South Korea and 
for national reunification. 
  The Kim Yong-sam fascist clique ruthlessly cracked down with 
a 100,000-strong police force on the struggle of the popular 
masses urging the investigation into the Kwangju massacre, 
punishment of the murderers and establishment of a genuine 
democratic government, which was waged on the lapse of 13 years 
since the Kwangju popular uprising. 
  The theaters of the students' struggle have been stained 
with 
blood and many core elements of the youth arrested, in South 
Korea. 
  The fascist clique brutally suppressed the people's struggle 
for vital rights by invoking the "government" power, calling it 
"collective egoism." It set in motion even the notorious 
"emergency arbitration power" invented in the period of the 
"Yusin" dictatorship. It is now mobilizing all the puppet 
police to check the struggle of the peasants and other people 
against its treacherous opening of the domestic rice market. 
  It is the traitor Kim Yong-sam and his "civilian" regime 
that 
would not hesitate to slay all the South Korean people, if it is 
for gratifying his greed for power and maintaining the fascist 
regime, regarding all the forces obstructive to it as the target 
of suppression. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet regime prolonging its days in 
reliance on the fascist bayonets, estranged from the people, 
must be removed in time.

<F P=106> ["Treacherous Hooligans Who Must Be Toppled" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 6 (KCNA) -- Papers today hit out 
at the criminal act of the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique in 
blocking a contact between Chondoist delegates of the North and 
the South at Panmunjom for discussing a joint celebration of the 
centenary of the Kabo Peasants' War in 1894. 
  A commentary of NODONG SINMUN says there is probably no 
other 
pack of traitors like the Kim Yong-sam group which even bans 
fellow countrymen from meeting each other while kissing 
aggressive foreign forces. 
  The analyst notes: 
  For the Chondoist organisations of the North and the South 
to 
have a contact for a joint celebration of the centenary of the 
Kabo Peasants' War was originally proposed as part of an 
independent civilian-level dialogue; the authorities need not 
and must not interfere in it. 
  However, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique of South Korea put 
its nose into this matter and trampled upon the agreement on 
having in early February a contact of Chondoist delegates of the 
North and the South. This was an impudent act of those who do 
not know their position and another unpardonable fascist outrage 
of the treacherous regime wearing the "civilian" mask. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group brought forward the "nuclear issue", 
blocking the contact between Chondoist delegates of the North 
and the South. This was an absurd pretext to bar not only the 
contact between Chondoist delegates, but also a joint 
organisation of the celebration of the centenary of the Kabo 
Peasants' War by the North and the South. This was a sophism 
which could convince nobody. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, a 
group of despicable traitors, truculent fascist dictators, 
savages and villains, must be overthrown in South Korea. 
  Chondoists and other people of South Korea must not pin any 
hope on the Kim Yong-sam traitor group but bring down a sledge 
hammer on its head and throw it onto the dust pin of history, 
united in a high patriotic spirit like the people who turned out 
in the Kabo Peasants' War. 
  MINJU CHOSON in a commentary says the South Korean puppet 
clique's blocking a working-level contact between Chondoist 
delegates of the North and the South was an anti-national act of 
those who do not know of the ancestors. This group of hooligans 
must be removed from the nation as soon as possible, it stresses.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 7 (KCNA) -- The obstacle lying 
in the way of reunification at present is the anti-national 
separatist Kim Yong-sam regime, says NODONG SINMUN in a signed 
article today. 
  Stressing that this regime must be toppled, it says: 
  The record of nearly one year after the appearance of the 
present regime in South Korea proves in stark reality that the 
Kim Yong-sam group is the heinous enemy of national 
reunification. 
  In his "inaugural address" the traitor Kim Yong-sam waxed 
eloquent about "the priority of the nation." But, in no time, he 
resumed the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises, which had 
been suspended toward the end of the "Sixth Republic Regime", 
against the North in league with outside forces and drove the 
North-South relations into a dangerous phase under the pretext 
of North's "nuclear problem." The puppets intercepted a letter 
containing the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole 
nation sent by the North to the South Korean authorities and 
representatives of different political parties, organisations 
and public figures and even totally rejected the North's 
proposal for the exchange of special envoys. 
  After taking office the traitor Kim Yong-sam has utterly 
ignored the reunification question and repeated the trite 
"stage-by-stage" doctrine of the preceding dictators. 
  In his "New Year address" and "New Year press conference", 
he 
did not utter even a word about reunification but spun out trash 
decrying the North and getting on its nerve. From this we can 
foresee that the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime will work viciously 
to aggravate the North-South relations and block reunification 
this year, too. 
  If the cause of national reunification is to be promoted, a 
powerful force for reunification must be built up and, at the 
same time, the force obstructive to reunification must be 
decisively removed. The movement for independence, democracy 
and reunification must be developed to a new, higher stage in 
South Korea to topple the Kim Yong-sam "civilian" fascist 
dictatorship.

  [Text] Yu Mi-yong, chairwoman of the Central Guidance 
Committee of the Korean Chondoist Association, today, released 
the following press statement condemning the South Korean 
authorities for preventing the Panmunjom contact of the 
Chondoist representatives of the North and South for the 
North-South joint commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the 
1894 Peasants War. 
  Press statement by Yu Mi-yong, chairwoman of the Central 
Guidance Committee of the Korean Chondoist Association: 
  Twentieth March marks the 100th anniversary of the 1894 
Peasants War. The ideals "Reject the West and Japan" and 
"Promote national interests and welfare of the people" which our 
Tonghak [Eastern Studies] believers and compatriots from all 
walks of life upheld in the 1894 Peasants War today inspire a 
love for the fatherland and nation among the Chondoists and all 
the fellow countrymen in the North and South. 
  Out of a desire for the North-South joint commemoration of 
the 100th anniversary of the 1894 Peasants War, as agreed 
between me and O Ik-che, head of the South Korean Central Office 
of Chondoism, I sent a telephone message to our counterpart in 
the South on 24 January and proposed a contact of working-level 
Chondoist representatives in Panmunjom on 3 February. 
  If this contact is held and if, as a result, the North and 
South jointly commemorate the 100th anniversary of the 1894 
Peasants War, this will no doubt contribute to ensuring that our 
fellow countrymen will oppose outside forces' intervention, 
achieve national unity, and achieve reunification in the 
nineties. 
  The Chondoists and brothers and sisters in the North and 
South welcomed our proposal that the Chondoist representatives 
of the North and South hold a contact in Panmunjom and expected 
that such contact would take place. However, the contact the 
Chondoist organizations of the North and South agreed on last 
year and have since sought to hold could not be held because of 
the South Korean authorities' unjust intervention and hindrance 
maneuvers. I express my grave regret for this and sternly 
condemn the South Korean authorities' crime -- of preventing 
Panmunjom contact of the Chondoists of the North and South -- 
before all the fellow countrymen. 
  The South Korean rulers aborted [yusan sikigo] the Panmunjom 
contact and prevented the North-South joint commemoration of the 
100th anniversary of the 1894 Peasants War this time. This is 
in no way justified. 
  For the Chondoist organizations of the North and South to 
hold a contact to jointly commemorate the 100th anniversary of 
the 1894 Peasants War is part of the independent civilian 
dialogue. And, the authorities have no reason to intervene, and 
must not do so. 
  However, without knowing its own place, the puppet South 
Korean authorities unhesitatingly committed an arrogant, 
uncourteous act of intervening into even the contact of the two 
sides' Chondoist representatives and having the two sides' 
agreement -- to hold contact in early February -- scrapped. 
  Moreover, the South Korean authorities used the nonexistent 
nuclear issue as an excuse to prevent a national event for 
upholding the patriotic spirit which the peasants and other 
uprisers displayed 100 years ago. We cannot but say this is a 
very shameless sophism. 
  They linked the commemoration to the so-called nuclear 
issue. 
This clearly shows they are making every effort to break up 
[pagi] the Panmunjom contact of the Chondoists of the North and 
South and prevent all the fellow countrymen from jointly 
commemorating the 100th anniversary of the 1894 Peasants War. 
  They prevented the contact of the Chondoists of the North 
and 
South for holding functions on the 100th anniversary of the 1894 
Peasants War, in which a pannational struggle was waged under 
the ideals "Reject the West and Japan" and "Promote national 
interests and welfare of the people." This again clearly shows 
the so-called civilian regime is a fascist regime and a 
treacherous group in every way. 
  As public opinion at home and abroad has already denounced, 
the Kim Yong-sam ring prevented reunification soccer games of 
university students of the North and South, prevented a while 
ago the visit to express condolence on the death of Reverend Mun 
Ik-hwan, a patriot who aspires for reunification, and even 
obstructed the joint holding of functions on the 100th 
anniversary of the 1894 Peasants War which was fought to defend 
national spirits. This proves the Kim Yong-sam ring is an 
antinational brigandish group [panminjok burhandang] that has no 
courtesy and does not pay due respects to the ancestors. 
  The Kim Yong-sam ring prevents visits and meetings among 
fellow countrymen, even while bringing outside forces, against 
whom fellow countrymen have a grudge, into South Korea. Those 
political swindlers reign over the South Korean Chondoists and 
people. This is a shame no one can tolerate. 
  The puppet Kim Yong-sam regime, which South Korean people do 
not trust, must be removed and overthrown [chegodoeoya hamyo 
tagodoeoya] as a matter of course. 
  I expect the South Korean Chondoists and people from all 
walks of life will have no illusion about the puppet Kim 
Yong-sam regime, display high patriotic spirits just like the 
participants in the 1894 Peasants War, overthrow [tado] the Kim 
Yong-sam ring, which turns its back on the nation and lives 
while licking at outside forces' hands, and build a genuine 
independent, democratic regime.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: "The Justifiable Struggle"] </F>
  [Text] According to Seoul radio, some 30,000 farmers, 
youth, and students held a rally at Taehang-no, Seoul on 1 
February opposing the puppet Kim Yong-sam clique's agricultural 
market opening, a treachery to the country and the nation. The 
farmers rally organized by nine farmers associations, including 
the National Federation of Farmers Associations, alias Chonnong, 
started at 1300 [0400 GMT] and lasted until 1530, giving a 
vigorous kick to repressions. With furious indignation, the 
participants of the rally berated and convicted the antinational 
act of the puppet Kim Yong-sam regime that sold markets of rice 
and other farm products to the United States. 
  After the rally, the participants staged a demonstration, 
exclaiming that they oppose importing farm products. The 
demonstrators rushed out to Tapkol Park and approached the U.S. 
Embassy in Sejong-no. Embarrassed with this, the civilian 
regime mobilized some 130-company riot police troops, and they 
frantically oppressed the demonstrators by firing tear gas at 
them in succession, just following the means that the military 
fascist dictators of the Fifth and Sixth Republics had used. 
  This enraged the demonstrators, who burned out five police 
vehicles while crying out anti-U.S. and antigovernment slogans. 
Some 500 students proceeded toward Chongwadae [presidential 
residence], dazzling the puppets. Youth and students disarmed 
about 100 riot police and set fire to their repressive 
equipment. The demonstration was held in downtown Seoul until 
2200. 
  At the same time, some 200 farmers from the North Cholla 
Provincial Branch of Chonnong demonstrated on the Seoul-Pusan 
expressway on their way to the rally site in Seoul to join the 
struggle. The struggle of South Korean farmers, youth, and 
students is an explosion of their indignation at the puppet Kim 
Yong-sam clique, which makes it its business to sell the country 
and the nation, and it is extremely justifiable. 
  As everyone knows, if the rice market is opened in South 
Korea, foreign rice will be rushed in there, stand unchallenged, 
and bring a great damage to the six million South Korean farmers 
and the South Korean agriculture, above all. South Korean rice, 
whose production cost is as much as five times higher than that 
of U.S. rice, will naturally be pushed out in the competition 
with U.S. rice. This will strike a deadly blow to farmers' 
livelihood, diminish their desire to produce rice, and result in 
a large-scale rural exodus. 
  The South Korean publications write: The rice market opening 
will destruct agriculture, whose food producing function will be 
paralyzed. At least two or three million farmers will give up 
farming, and this will accelerate the devastation of rural areas. 
  The rice market opening will also exert serious influence 
upon agriculture-related sectors -- such as fertilizer, farming 
machinery, and farming materials production -- and result in 
unemployment and bankruptcy. Housing and employment problems 
will be increased in urban areas and working people's social and 
economic status will be seriously aggravated. 
  When the so-called special tax for farming and fishing 
villages, which the puppet Kim Yong-sam clique is trying to 
enforce under the pretext of preventing farmers from suffering 
damages, is added to this, people will stand sufferings beyond 
description. 
  Facts show that the puppet Kim Yong-sam clique's rice market 
opening maneuver is an intolerable, big criminal act that 
gravely threatens the survival of not only millions of South 
Korean farmers but also thousands of South Korean people and 
reduces them to slaves of foreign rice and foreign monopolistic 
capitals. 
  Under this situation, how on earth can the South Korean 
people restrain themselves from struggling against the puppet 
Kim Yong-sam clique that is trying to cut off their lifeline. 
  Nevertheless, the puppet Kim Yong-sam clique is frantically 
oppressing people involved in the farmers rally, like an act of 
a thief raising a hue and cry. On 2 February, traitor Kim 
Yong-sam told his petty men that violence cannot be allowed, 
that leading members of the rally must be thoroughly 
investigated, and the like. 
  According to the puppet traitor's oppressive order, the 
puppet police, prosecution, and other fascist oppressive groups 
are making a stir of investigating demonstrators and farmers 
associations. This is, however, nothing but a desperate effort 
of those who have no future. Fascist oppression can never 
control the people's struggling spirit, and it only excites the 
people's antigovernment struggle all the more. The struggle 
against the rice market opening is actually being expanded, and 
people from various classes and strata are joining it. This is 
because the South Korean people are aware of the fact that the 
popular masses should unite for the struggle against the fascist 
oppression and that only such a struggle can deter and destruct 
the rascals' rice market opening maneuver and can overthrow 
[tado] the country and nation-selling group. 
  It is no accident that the opposition Democratic Party 
leader 
appealed to politicians and the popular masses to actively 
cooperate in struggling against the agricultural market opening. 
  The South Korean people will finally overthrow the country 
and nation-selling Kim Yong-sam group by launching into a more 
cooperative and active struggle. The Kim Yong-sam group must 
look straight at the development of situation, act discreetly, 
and had better retire from power before being given a stern 
trial by the people.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 5 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
National Federation of Peasants Associations (Chonnong) called a 
press conference in Seoul on February 2 and demanded that the 
"government" punish those who walked away demonstrators against 
agricultural market opening on February 1 and compensate to 
them, according to a radio report from Seoul. 
  Recalling that the indiscreet crackdown upon the peaceful 
demonstrators by the combat police touched off the anger of 
peasants and students and led them to counterattack, Chonnong 
said the puppet government authorities were to blame for the 
collision in the demonstration of peasants and students against 
the agricultural market opening. 
  Chonnong warned that if the authorities countered a future 
demonstration of peasants by force, it would respond with a 
corresponding stiff struggle.

<F P=106> ["President Kim Il-song Is, Indeed, the Great of Great </F>
Unprecedented in Human History" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 5 (KCNA) -- Repercussions of 
"With the Century", reminiscences of the great leader President 
Kim Il-song, are growing widespread among the South Korean 
people as days go by. 
  A journalist surnamed Pak residing in Chungju said after 
avidly reading the reminiscences: 
  "President Kim Il-song in his reminiscences put aside his 
activities, feats and traits and looked back mostly on the feats 
and activities of comrades-in-arms and ordinary people with whom 
he had shared life and death, sweets and bitters in the days of 
the anti-Japanese patriotic struggle, thus exalting them to a 
high position in the history of the nation. 
  "From this one fact alone we can know well that President 
Kim 
Il-song is, indeed, the great of great unprecedented in human 
history, with distinguished personality as a leader." 
  A professor Choe of Korea University said President Kim 
Il-song shared sweets and bitters with the fellow countrymen, 
shouldering the destiny of the country and the nation from his 
childhood. Regarding the idea of "believing in the people as in 
heaven", the idea of worshiping the people, as his maxim, 
General Kim Il-song has devoted his all solely to the sacred 
cause for the freedom and liberation of the people throughout is 
80 year life, he noted. 
  A Yi living in Talsong County, North Kyongsang Province, 
said 
President Kim Il-song is, indeed, the great leader of the 
nation, the benevolent fatherly leader of the people who is 
administering politics for the people, believing in them. 
  "We, the people in the South, must be under the 
administration of President Kim Il-song, if we are also to lead 
a happy life free from any worries." 
  WOLGAN CHOSON, KYONGHYANG daily news, TONG-A ILBO, HANGUK 
ILBO and other South Korean publications carried the autographic 
writings of President Kim Il-song in the reminiscences saying 
"revolutionaries, believe in the people and rely on them at all 
times and you shall always emerge victorious; if you are 
forsaken by them, you will always fail. Let this be your maxim 
in your life and struggle and widely introduced the 
reminiscences.

<F P=106> ["Inevitable Result of Corrupt Politics" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 5 (KCNA) -- Robberies reported 
one after another in South Korea are an inevitable result of the 
treacherous policy and corrupt politics of the Kim Yong-sam 
puppet clique and his "civilian" regime, says NODONG SINMUN in a 
commentary today. 
  Nearly 20 robbery cases were registered in South Korea in 
January, which were shuddering robberies involving the use of 
weapons and looting. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group is staging what it calls "180-day 
operation for wiping off crimes" while advertizing "public peace 
for the people". But the spearhead of the repressive forces is 
always directed against the patriotic forces which call for 
independence, democracy and reunification, the analyst notes, 
and goes on: 
  It is not without reason that South Korean public criticizes 
Kim Yong-sam, asking why the traitor who has been merciless in 
suppressing the patriotic forces, is so incompetent in nabbing 
robbers. 
  The gang robberies in South Korea are immediate consequences 
of the misdeeds of the traitor Kim Yong-sam and other elements 
of the ruling quarters who stand in the foreground in fraud, 
swindle and corruption, fostering crimes and vices in society. 
  The social evils spreading in South Korea these days are 
signs of the end of the "civilian" regime. 
  It is not long before the traitor Kim Yong-sam and his 
"civilian" regime meet their disgraceful doom.

<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN Hits Out at Anti-DPRK Smear Campaign of </F>
Japanese Reactionaries" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 5 (KCNA) -- The Japanese 
reactionaries are engaging themselves in a feverish smear 
campaign against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea by 
spreading through subsidized media the false rumor that the DPRK 
is manufacturing nuclear weapons with the help of Russia. 
  An instance of it is the report of the Japanese weekly 
magazine SHUKAN BUNSHUN that Russian scientists helped the DPRK 
in "the development of nuclear weapons". 
  Recalling that the chief of the general staff of the Russian 
Armed Forces laid bare the falsity of the article carried in the 
Japanese weekly, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today exposes the 
purpose of the anti-DPRK smear campaign of the Japanese 
reactionaries. 
  The analyst says: 
  The Japanese reactionaries are trying to hinder the 
triumphant advance of our republic and the solution to the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. 
  They have so far noisily vociferated about "nuclear 
development" by the DPRK in an attempt to isolate it and used it 
as a pretext to step up their own nuclear armament. 
  If the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula is 
fundamentally 
solved, Japan will lose the pretext to accelerate its nuclear 
armament. In setting abroad the fiction of "assistance of 
Russian experts," it is motivated by a sinister design to 
obstruct the solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean 
peninsula. 
  It is a foolish act for the Japanese reactionaries to 
attempt 
to disparage our socialism with fabrications. They should 
clearly understand the anthropocentric socialism of Korean style 
and stop running amuck. 
  Their anti-DPRK false propaganda will bring no favorable 
result to Japan.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 4 (KCNA) -- A Tanzanian national 
seminar on "Abuses of Socialism Are Intolerable", an immortal 
classical work of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, was held 
in Dar-es-Salaam on January 29 under the sponsorship of the 
Tanzanian national coordinating committee of the chuche idea 
study groups on the occasion of his birthday. 
  Speaking at the seminar, F. Limo, member of the national 
executive committee of the Revolutionary Party of Tanzania, said 
that the work is of weighty significance as it was published at 
a time when socialism has suffered a setback in Eastern Europe 
and a serious politico-ideological struggle was taking place on 
the international arena. 
  He stressed: 
  The cause of the collapse of socialism in some countries was 
made clear by the great chuche idea. 
  The collapse of socialism was a product of the conspiracy 
between the imperialists and counterrevolutionary forces and a 
result of the ideological and cultural infiltration of 
imperialism and the corrosive influence of the right opportunist 
idea. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in the work fully laid 
bare the reactionary nature of the sophism of the imperialists 
and renegades of socialism who accused socialism of being 
"totalitarian", "barracks-like" and "administrative and 
commanding". 
  The speakers at the seminar said it is an immortal classical 
work which dealt a decisive blow at the moves of the 
imperialists and renegades of socialism by fully laying bare the 
reactionary essence of the sophism of the enemies of socialism 
and gave firm conviction and courage to the people by powerfully 
demonstrating the justice of the cause of socialism. 
  A letter to Comrade Kim Chong-il was adopted at the seminar.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 7 (KCNA) -- MINJU CHOSON Sunday 
carried an editorial article titled "Main Characteristics of 
Politics of the Dear Leader Comrade Kim Chong-il". 
  The article says fundamental characteristics of the politics 
of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il lies in that it is 
politics of fervent love for and trust in the people. 
  The article quotes the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song as 
saying: 
  "It can be said that love for and trust in the revolutionary 
comrades and people constitute main characteristics of the 
politics of Comrade Kim Chong-il." 
  The article further says: 
  The dear leader, basing himself on a profound exposition of 
the relationship between politics and love and trust, formulated 
love for and trust in the people as the basic principle of 
socialist politics, a fundamental basis of our-style politics 
for the first time, and has brilliantly carried it into reality. 
  The dear leader's politics the basic feature and principle 
of 
which is love and trust consists mainly of independence, 
democracy, unity and benevolence. 
  Independent politics is the first and foremost essential 
content of the dear leader's politics of love and trust. 
  The dear leader shapes all lines and policies to meet the 
supreme interests of our nation and our people and leads them to 
resolutely implement them to the letter without any concession 
so as to demonstrate to the whole world the dignity, honor and 
indomitable spirit of our people. 
  His politics is typical of democratic politics in the true 
sense of the word. 
  Drawing himself on the unshakable chuche-based viewpoint 
that 
power belongs to the people and everything of the world is 
created by the working masses and social relations change and 
develop by their strength, he always makes the popular masses 
the masters of all political activities and socio-political life 
and solves all knotty problems in reliance upon their efforts 
and wisdom. 
  Politics of unity guarantees the might of politics of love 
and trust. 
  His politics is typical of politics of unity. 
  Inheriting the noble idea of the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song that comradeship is priceless, he administers politics 
of love, politics of unity sparing nothing for comrades and for 
their unity. 
  Love for and trust in the people is manifested as 
benevolence 
in politics. 
  His politics is a model of benevolent politics. He always 
leads and takes warm care of the popular masses like a 
tender-hearted father, takes pleasure in the happiness of people 
and continues to show deep benevolence for them. 
  Dear Comrade Kim Chong-il is an illustrious leader of our 
party and people who is possessed of noble popular personalities 
and administers politics of love for and trust in the people, 
the article says, and continues: 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's love and trust is 
most 
noble and great; he first shows loving care for and trust in the 
popular masses; he rears the popular masses to be independent 
human beings and communist revolutionaries of chuche type. 
  His love for and trust in the people is immeasurably broad, 
eternal and meticulous. 
  His politics of love and trust is the source of great 
strength which gives rise to loyalty and filial piety of our 
people and builds up our revolutionary ranks into invincible 
ranks united in one mind. 
  Our-style socialism under which the illustrious leader 
administers politics of love and trust is invincible for ever, 
stresses the article.

<F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 5 February editorial: "Let All Functionaries </F>
Stand at the Van of Every Work"] 
  [Text] Today our people are vigorously accelerating the 
general march to glorify this year as the year of a historic 
turning point in our revolution and construction by upholding 
the militant slogans of the party and the leader. 
  The revolutionary zeal of the masses has been 
extraordinarily 
enhanced and we faced enormous tasks. This reality demands that 
the guiding functionaries revolutionize themselves more than 
ever before and stand at the van of every work. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: Whether 
success can be attained in the revolutionary struggle and 
construction work or not will largely depend on how the 
cadres--commanding members of the revolution--will work. 
  Cadres are the backbone of our party and revolutionary ranks 
and are commanding members of the revolution. The firmness and 
combat capabilities of the party and revolutionary ranks largely 
depend on the cadres and the issue of registering a 
revolutionary turn in socialist construction depends on the 
cadres. 
  Only when the functionaries firmly prepare themselves 
ideologically by thoroughly revolutionizing themselves and only 
when they excellently carry out the role of the vanguard in all 
works, can they vigorously push ahead with the revolution and 
construction and firmly defend, protect and glorify our-style 
socialism. 
  It is a revolutionary mission for guiding functionaries, who 
uphold the party, to stand at the van of all works. Our party is 
the party which carries out the revolution and struggle, and is 
a motherly party which leads destiny of the people by bearing 
the responsibility. 
  It is a lofty intent of the dear comrade leader to carry out 
benevolent politics for the people and to make the cadres 
genuine faithful servants of the people who embody the party's 
benevolent politics. 
  Functionaries of our party should more satisfactorily have 
lofty traits as commanding members of the revolution and as 
faithful servants of the people by constantly revolutionizing 
themselves, and should always work devotedly for the party and 
the people. 
  It is an important demand in brilliantly carrying out 
gigantic revolutionary tasks facing us this year for leading 
functionaries to stand at the van of all works. 
  The spirit of struggle of the masses, who rose in the 
worthwhile struggle to implement our party's revolutionary 
economic strategy, is very high. The issue is for leading 
functionaries, who command each outpost of general march, to 
correctly organize and mobilize the masses by displaying the 
revolutionary spirit and combat capability. 
  The experience in the units, which created miracles and 
innovations in the first march of the new year, illustrates that 
only when functionaries stand at the van of others with the 
initiative, will all works be carried out satisfactorily. 
  The cadres decide everything in the revolutionary struggle 
and construction work. How thoroughly the agriculture-first, 
light industry-first, and trade-first policy is implemented 
depends on the cadres at last. 
  When the functionaries organize and command at the van of 
the 
struggle to implement the party's policy with loyalty to the 
party and with the spirit of devoted service for the people, we 
can successfully accomplish all tasks, no matter how gigantic 
they may be, and can effect a great revolutionary upsurge in 
this year's socialist general march. 
  It is also an important insurance for firmly consolidating 
our single-hearted unity with the party and the leader [suryong] 
for the leading functionaries to stand at the van of every work. 
  The single-hearted unity between the party and revolutionary 
ranks is a powerful weapon which only our party--the chuche-type 
revolutionary party--has. 
  Because there is such single-hearted unity, we can break 
through all trials, no matter how difficult and complex they may 
be, and can defend and carry to accomplishment our-style 
socialism without wavering even to a slight degree, no matter 
how strong the enemy may provoke. 
  Our functionaries should further consolidate our firm 
single-hearted unity, which has been attained the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il as the center. 
  When the functionaries--the standard-bearer and genuine 
educators of the masses--precisely educate and lead the party 
members and working people, the people will more firmly trust 
and follow the party and our single-hearted unity will be 
consolidated in an indomitable unity. 
  The issue of more highly displaying the superiority of 
our-style socialism importantly depends on the role of leading 
functionaries. 
  Today our people, without exception, absolutely support and 
endlessly trust our-style socialism. It is important for leading 
functionaries to struggle devotedly so that superiority of this 
system be more highly demonstrated. 
  The leading functionaries should devotedly struggle to more 
highly display the superiority of this system. Our functionaries 
are assigned with the mission to infiltrate warm benevolence of 
the party and the leader more thoroughly into the people and to 
provide them with happier and richer life. 
  When the functionaries actively struggle to brilliantly 
achieve our party's intent to make the people live more happily, 
the imperialists will get week-knees, no matter how frantically 
they maneuver to isolate and crush our-style socialism, and the 
sound of "Long live socialism!" will continually resound from 
among our people. 
  The party's expectations for leading functionaries in 
today's 
general march are very great. Our party has not only assigned 
important revolutionary outposts to functionaries but also 
energetically led functionaries so that they constantly 
revolutionize themselves. This reflects our party's lofty intent 
to foster all functionaries to be unswerving revolutionaries who 
share destiny with the party and the leader to the end, and to 
be genuine faithful servants who devotedly serve the people. 
  The outposts assigned to our functionaries are different 
from 
each other. However, the position on which they should stand 
always is the van of every work. Those who should play the 
kernel role in the struggle to uphold our party and to 
strengthen the single-hearted unity are our functionaries and 
those who should lead at the van the struggle to carry to 
accomplishment the party's revolutionary economic strategy by 
displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous 
struggle are our functionaries. The men who should set an 
example in the work to establish law-abiding trait and the 
socialist life style are our cadres. 
  Without the kernel and vanguard role of our functionaries, 
they cannot think of any worth and honor as commanding members 
of the revolution, no matter what revolutionary outposts they 
are in charge of. 
  All functionaries should keenly realize that the destiny of 
the party, of the revolution and of socialism, depends on how 
they prepare themselves ideologically and on how they enhance 
their role, and should stand at the van of all works. Thus, they 
should fulfill the mission as commanding members of the 
revolution. 
  Functionaries should, above all, uphold the party at the van 
of others with faithful loyalty. The faithful loyalty is a basic 
trait that commanding members of the revolution should cherish. 
The revolutionary fighters should fight to the end with faithful 
loyalty for the party and the leader [suryong] by sharing 
destiny with the leader [yongdoja] by dedicating their lives. 
Herein lies their valuable life and honor. 
  Functionaries should become the standard-bearers and 
vanguard 
in upholding the party and the leader [suryong]. Functionaries 
should entrust the party with their whole destiny and should 
loyally uphold the party and the leader to the end with thorough 
faith and determination to die at their posts while defending 
them. 
  Just as commanders of anti-Japanese guerrilla units who 
fought by willingly dedicating their lives to defending and 
protecting the respected comrade commander, our functionaries 
should dedicate all of their wisdom and energy to the struggle 
to achieve the intent and ideas of the leader [yongdoja] by 
sharing destiny with the great leader [yongdoja]. 
  In particular, functionaries should direct essential 
interest 
to safeguarding and glorifying forever the achievements made by 
the party and the leader. Functionaries should precisely inform 
the party members and working people of greatness of the 
achievements made by the party and the leader and should 
consistently carry out the work to glorify such achievements. 
  Functionaries of the unit who received on-the-spot guidance 
must work well to make their unit an example of the whole nation 
and must thoroughly implement the tasks presented at the 
on-the-spot guidance. 
  It is important for functionaries to have high party spirit 
like Comrade Yi In-mo by loyally upholding the leader [yongdoja] 
of the revolution. The words of the poem dedicated to the dear 
comrade leader by Comrade Yi In-mo are filled with his attitude, 
position, and lucid party spirit toward the party and the leader. 
  All functionaries must reflect their party spirit to Comrade 
Yi In-mo's party spirit and must exert all efforts to train and 
self-discipline themselves ideologically. Functionaries must 
also have a sacrificial service spirit to the people and must 
struggle by devoting everything to the people. 
  Our functionaries emerge from the working masses, including 
workers and farmers, and they are messengers of the people who 
are possessed with the mission to serve them loyally. For our 
functionaries, serving the people with devotion is the road of 
complete loyalty to the party and the leader. There is no 
greater happiness and worthiness for the functionaries than 
further upholding the party's and leader's plan and intention 
and receiving the masses' faith and love by working as the 
people's faithful servants. 
  In our society the party and the regime serve the people, 
the 
people give orders, and functionaries are entrusted with the 
duty of implementing them. All functionaries must faithfully 
experience our party's ideology of believing in the people as in 
heaven, and carry out all work by always thinking and acting 
from the position that they are the messengers of the people. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il taught that for 
functionaries to go into the masses and serving the people 
devotedly are the same as eating healthy food, and for 
functionaries to exercise power and bureaucratism are the same 
as eating poisonous food. This is a favorite proverb in the 
work and life of our functionaries, which must always be 
engraved and embodied in their minds. 
  Our functionaries must highly uphold the slogan of "Serving 
the people," presented by the party, always go deeply into the 
masses to listen attentively to their demands and fulfill their 
demands at the right time, and must exert themselves to make the 
people's living standard more abundant, even though they may 
sleep and rest less. 
  Those who are indifferent about the people's living 
conditions cannot be regarded as commanding members of the true 
revolution. Like the people's faithful servants, when there are 
good things and happy events take place, our functionaries must 
think of the people first, affectionately take care of the 
people's living conditions -- from the political, labor, 
cultural life to the family life -- so they can exert all their 
strength in carrying out their revolutionary duties. 
  There cannot be satisfaction in the work to implement the 
party's intention of devotedly serving the people. Our 
functionaries must actively learn the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il's endlessly lofty trait of always thinking of the 
people first, being thoughtful of working to provide better 
things for them, and find utmost delight from the people's 
happiness. Therefore, work must be carried out to brilliantly 
embody the party's intention of making functionaries work more 
and allowing the people receive more benefits. 
  Our functionaries must also highly manifest the 
revolutionary 
trait of unconditionally receiving and thoroughly implementing 
the party's ideology and plan. Unconditionally receiving and 
thoroughly implementing the party's ideology and plan are just 
duties of the cadres and a revolutionary attitude. 
Functionaries must have the spirit of absoluteness toward the 
party policy so the party's ideology and plan can be thoroughly 
advocated and fulfill their duty as the commanding members of 
the revolution. 
  Our functionaries must regard the party's ideology and plan 
as their faith, accept them as an absolute truth, and must think 
and act only in accordance with the party's ideology and 
intention in whatever environment. 
  Today's general march to implement the party's revolutionary 
economic strategy is a responsible struggle that inspects the 
functionaries' faithfulness and revolutionary spirit. 
Functionaries must devote all their energy and wisdom in the 
struggle to implement the party's plan and orders, and do a 
splendid job of the task that they are entrusted with through 
skillful operations and command. In particular, in accordance 
with the demand of the Chongsan-ri spirit, Chongsan-ri method, 
and the Taean work system, functionaries must always go deeply 
into the producer masses and live under the same roof with them 
so they can be roused in the new struggle and feat. They must 
also sow plants with their own hands and harvest with their own 
hands. 
  Self-reliance and hard struggle, this is the criteria of 
functionaries' loyalty to the party and the revolution. Under 
the condition in which the imperialists intensify economic 
blockade maneuvers to stifle us, our functionaries should stand 
at the van to implement thoroughly the party's policy, upholding 
the banner of self-reliance and hard struggle to defend and 
adhere to the socialism of our own style and bring full its 
vitality. 
  With the firm will that what the party decides, we will do, 
functionaries should vigorously strive to carry out the given 
revolutionary tasks with their own efforts by seeking out what 
is in short supply and producing what is deficient. In 
particular, they should learn by Comrade (Chong Chun-sil)'s 
example of spirit of devotion, sacrifice, and self-reliance that 
was shown in the struggle to realize the party's plan and to 
promote the people's standard of living. 
  Our functionaries, as Comrade (Chong Chun-sil) did, should 
open a passage of advancement by pushing hard with their renewed 
courage whenever they are faced with difficult tasks. They 
should complete their entrusted tasks and should highly display 
the ethos of deliberating and running until their tasks are 
brilliantly achieved. 
  In order to stand at the van of every task, it is very 
important for the functionaries to possess the revolutionary 
work method and popular work style. All functionaries should 
positively learn by the revolutionary work method of Comrade Kim 
Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and should work 
in accordance with it. 
  Whatever they may do in any position, functionaries should 
eliminate their conventional attitude and have plain and easy 
characters. They should always be humble before the masses and 
be upright, unaware of any recompense or privilege. They should 
always be with the masses and share joy and sorrow with them. 
By climbing a mountain ridge and carrying burdens before 
others, functionaries should stand at the van of the masses if 
it is for the people. Functionaries should become accustomed to 
living in this way. 
  If functionaries are to become genuine commanding officers 
of 
the revolution, who are endlessly loyal to the party and the 
leader, they should make steady efforts to carry out the works 
to train and discipline themselves in a revolutionary manner. 
There is no born revolutionary nor consummated commanding 
officers of the revolution. One can become a genuine chuche-type 
revolutionary only through steady ideological discipline to 
revolutionize themselves and revolutionary practice. As a gem 
sparks only when it is constantly cleaned, a revolutionary can 
endlessly add luster to its political life by training himself 
in a revolutionary manner and putting forth strong demands. 
  Most of our functionaries are the people who were brought up 
after the liberation of the fatherland under the bosom of the 
party without any difficulties or worries. Our party's line on 
endlessly revolutionizing commanding officials is the most just 
line that enables our functionaries to be brought up as genuine 
chuche-type revolutionaries. Responsible functionaries should 
set examples in standing at the van of revolutionizing. 
  As the saying goes "When the upper part of water is clean so 
is the lower part," when the responsible functionaries 
revolutionize themselves and make constant demands, the lower 
functionaries will follow them. 
  The functionaries should always join a grand struggle to 
implement the party's policy to revolutionize themselves. In 
particular, they should mingle with the working class and 
positively learn by their unlimited loyalty to the party and the 
leader, and their strong revolutionary spirit and working class 
spirit. 
  Functionaries should sincerely participate in the party 
organizational life and endlessly discipline their partisanship 
by learning by the noble view of organization shown by the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  Functionaries should always work and live in conformity with 
the party organization from a standpoint of being a 
rank-and-file member of the party and consciously strive to 
receive the party organization's guidance and control. All of 
our functionaries are revolutionary fighters who are fighting 
with the promise to be loyal to the party and the leader. 
  All functionaries should not forget the promises they made 
before the party and stand at the van of every task. By doing 
so, they should become a staunch chuche-type revolutionary, 
sharing life and death with the party, and a faithful servant 
devotedly serving the people.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 4 (KCNA) -- Foreign visitors 
highly praised the West Sea barrage of world standard built by 
the DPRK in an eight km section at the cost of 4 billion 
dollars. 
  Prof. Genevieve Clancy of Paris University No.1 of France 
said that the West Sea barrage is a wonderful structure showing 
the inexhaustible creative power of humanity. He said he had 
visited many countries but had never seen such a great creation 
beyond human imagination. 
  He noted that the barrage built by the Korean people with 
their own designs, technique and materials fully showed the 
mighty economic power of Korea and the indomitable fighting 
spirit of the Korean people who are advancing under the banner 
of self-reliance. 
  Head of the Cairo University delegation of Egypt 'Ali 
Muhammad Sharawy said: 
  "Such a gigantic barrage as the West Sea barrage cannot be 
seen anywhere else in the world. The U.S. imperialists and the 
South Korean puppets squandered a large amount of materials and 
funds in building the concrete wall, a symbol of division, in 
the area South of the Military Demarcation Line, but the people 
here have built a gigantic barrage for the prosperity of the 
country in an eight kilometer section of a rough sea. Through 
these two different realities we can see how just the cause of 
the Korean people is." 
  Head of a Nepalese delegation for the study of the chuche 
idea Manik Lal Shrestha said: 
  "The West Sea barrage is a vivid token of the enormous 
economic power of Korea. With the independent national economy 
and the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, the Korean people 
are energetically stepping up production and construction, 
unshaken by any economic pressure and blockade of the 
imperialists." 
  Member of the Ayn Shams University delegation from Egypt 
Salman Sali said it was a fascinating miracle that such great 
project as the West Sea barrage was completed in a matter of 
five years.

<F P=106> ["`Korea, a Country of Independence, Self-Sustenance and </F>
Self-Reliance in Defence'" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 5 (KCNA) -- Foreign visitors to 
Korea praise Korea as a powerful country of independence, 
self-sustenance and self-reliance in defence. 
  Victor Voichita, chairman of the Romanian Party for New 
Society, said Korea is an independent country. 
  He stressed: 
  "Independence is the life and soul of a country and a 
nation. 
The Korean people are firmly adhering to independence in the 
revolution and construction as they are advancing with a tight 
hold on the line of independence, self-sustenance and 
self-reliance in defence. With this great line, Korea is 
vigorously accelerating socialist construction without the 
slightest vacillation." 
  Secretary General of the Central Committee of the Dominican 
Communist Party Narciso Isa Conde said: 
  "The Korean people are solving all the questions in 
socialist 
construction by their own efforts. As they have a powerful 
independent economy, the party, the government and the people of 
Korea strictly abide by their will and demand in working out and 
implementing lines and policies. 
  "The Korean people have registered world-startling 
achievements as we see today by implementing the line of 
building an independent economy under the wise guidance of the 
dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il." 
  Prof. and Dr. P.C. Verma of the University of Delhi, India 
noted that the history of socialist construction of Korea 
practically shows the socialist cause is unswervingly advancing, 
overcoming whatever grim ordeals, as the idea is great and the 
revolutionary line is correct. He stated: 
  "Korean-style socialism is socialism of chuche which 
develops 
with the chuche idea as a guideline. 
  "The chuche idea is applied to the political, economic and 
defence sectors. The example of Korea in enforcing independent 
politics to defend and realize independence and building an 
independent economy which walks on its own feet and self-reliant 
national defence power capable of reliably defending the 
security of the country and the gains of revolution is a great 
success, which all the countries should follow. 
  "Korea which is implementing the line of independence, 
self-sustenance and self-reliance in defence under the wise 
guidance of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il will further 
prosper and develop and stand forever as a fortress of 
socialism."

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 5 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
have struck a deal to resolve a trade dispute over government 
procurement for telecommunications and medical equipment, a 
Japanese Government source said Saturday [5 February]. 
  Government procurement of telecommunications and medical 
equipment is one of the areas covered under bilateral talks on a 
new trade framework which the two countries hope to reach 
agreement by February 11, when Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
is to meet U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington. 
  The deal came after four days of bilateral negotiations held 
since Tuesday at the Foreign Ministry, the source said. 
  As part of the deal, Tokyo offered to introduce an open 
bidding system for purchases of telecommunications and medical 
equipment valued at more than 100,000 Special Drawing Rights 
(SDRs) or some 19 million yen, the source said. 
  Japan also promised to introduce a "comprehensive" 
evaluation 
system to decide on which equipment to purchase on the basis of 
not only price but also other factors to make it easier for U.S. 
suppliers to win contracts, the source said. 
  Japanese and U.S. trade negotiators have long been at odds 
over the minimum value of contracts to be opened to general 
bidding, as Washington demanded 5,000 SDRs against the 130,000 
SDRs sought by Japan. 
  The source indicated that the comprehensive evaluation 
system 
would apply only to medical equipment, as U.S. medical devices 
are usually priced higher than those made in Japan. 
  The talks over government procurement are part of the 
so-called framework talks under which the two sides hope to 
agree on ways to slash Japan's massive trade surplus with the 
United States.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 7 KYODO -- A top Foreign Ministry 
official denied Monday [7 February] U.S. claims that Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata is responsible for bilateral trade 
framework talks on the whole. 
  Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito told a press conference 
that it is "somewhat inadequate" to say Hata is responsible in 
overseeing the framework talks because three government 
ministries are in charge of three fields in the talks. But Hata 
will naturally fulfill his role as the foreign minister and 
deputy prime minister, Saito said. 
  Saito said if subcabinet-level talks fail to reach accords 
by 
the time Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President 
Bill Clinton meet on Friday, the Japanese negotiators may ask 
for Hata's judgment. But it is still unclear if Hata will 
directly take part in negotiations, he said. 
  The U.S. Trade Representative's Office issued a statement 
Friday saying Hata is responsible for the bilateral negotiations 
and that Trade Representative Mickey Kantor will be in contact 
with Hata "on a daily basis" in the coming days. 
  Japan and the United States remain at loggerheads over a 
U.S. 
demand that "objective criteria" be set to gauge foreign access 
to Japan's markets. The two sides will reopen subcabinet-level 
talks in Washington Monday in a last-ditch effort to wrap up the 
talks before Friday's summit in Washington. 
  Tokyo and Washington are expected to draw up a progress 
report on the framework talks, initialed in July, in time for 
the summit.

  [Text] Australia has welcomed the U.S. decision to lift its 
embargo on Vietnam. A spokesperson for the foreign minister, 
Gareth Evans, said although the decision does not include the 
establishment of diplomatic relations, it is a positive step 
toward Vietnam's acceptance in the international community. The 
spokesperson says the increased competition which is likely to 
result between Australian and U.S. firms in Vietnam should also 
be welcomed.

<F P=106> ["Rejection by the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea </F>
[Khmer Rouge] Spokesman;" 6 February; place not given -- read by 
announcer] 
  [Text] I. Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Puppet 
Hun Sen of the two-headed government on 5 February [words 
indistinct] stated that the troops of the Vietnamese communist 
puppets and two-headed government have already captured Anlung 
Veng [Siem Reap Province]. This statement is designed to 
conceal the serious defeats suffered by the Vietnamese communist 
puppets, the Vietnamese communists, the alliance, and the 
two-headed government. 
  II. It is worth recalling that the provisional two-headed 
government formed in January 1993 was set up by the Vietnamese 
communists and the alliance to further the Vietnamese war of 
aggression against the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea 
[NADK] and other national resistance forces. In fact, the 
government belongs to the Vietnamese communists, the United 
States, and the alliance. People are all aware that the Para 
troops [Khmer People's National Liberation Front] were jointly 
created by the United States and the alliance in the time of In 
Tam [former prime minister under Lon Nol regime] in 1975. The 
United States and the alliance supplied money, material, 
uniforms, food, camps, and training schools to the troops, which 
are their (?important) forces. So when it saw the forces of the 
Vietnamese communists, the United States, and the alliance 
combining, the two-headed government also merged the two armies 
[National Army of Independent Cambodia and Cambodian People's 
Armed Forces] politically and militarily. This is why the 
government has only raised its three-point policy demanding that 
the NADK be dissolved, that Democratic Kampuchea's liberated 
zones be surrendered to the government, and that the Party of 
Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] lay down arms and stop fighting in a 
war that continues to be inflamed by the Vietnamese communists 
and the two-headed government. 
  III. Political, military, and diplomatic events during the 
implementation of the Paris accord, during the protectorate of 
UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia], and during the 
tenure of the two-headed government [words indistinct] have 
clearly shown that the old and new enemies of our nation and 
people continue to maintain their strategy of doing away with 
our nation and people. However, historic, political, military, 
diplomatic, and all other events in the past two years and at 
present are clear evidence that the nation's enemies can never 
destroy our national forces and people, who have struggled for 
years to defend the nation, people, and (?race). 
  IV. In particular, the offensives launched during this 16th 
dry season by (?the two-headed government), the Vietnamese 
communists, the United States, and the alliance in the areas of 
(?Phnum Chhat), Stoung-Kompong Thom, Malai, south Sisophon, 
(?Pailin), Moung-Pursat, Kompong Chhnang, (?Kompong Thom), 
Kampot, Koh Kong, Kompong Cham, [words indistinct], Preah 
Vihear, (?Route 12), Route 68, and so on have been defeated one 
after another. The invading troops and [words indistinct] have 
been opposed and counterattacked by the national resistance 
forces in the political, military, economic, and communications 
fields everywhere. 
  V. Moreover, major offensives were launched by the 
two-headed government with the aim of (?capturing) the Anlung 
Veng area, but they were severely defeated for the first time in 
early (?October) 1993, the second time at the end of January 
1994, and the third time on 4 and 5 February 1994. In Phnom 
Penh, 99 percent of the two-headed government belongs to the 
Vietnamese communists, while in the provinces it is 100 percent. 
The government also belongs to the United States and the 
alliance 100 percent. 
  VI. The Vietnamese communist puppet and Prince Krompreah 
Norodom Ranariddh of the two-heads-three-eyes government on 5 
February agonizingly proclaimed their alleged victory at Anlung 
Veng. But people (?say): 
  A. The fact that Puppet Hun Sen spoke [words indistinct] 
about its success is because the puppets have actually suffered 
a great defeat on the battlefield. They have not captured even 
one inch captured of Anlung Veng. Most of their forces have 
been destroyed in the fighting by malaria and typhoid due to the 
lack of medicine, by starvation, and by the summary executions 
of puppet leaders including Long Sopheap, Prum Samen, and Keo 
Prasit. Their troops do not dare to go and fight and groups of 
hundreds of puppet and para soldiers have fled the battlefields. 
The 1, 2, 3, and 4 February 1994 statements of Vietnamese 
communist puppets and two-headed government are also not 
consistent. Puppet Hun Sen stated that Anlung Veng had already 
been captured, while other puppets such as Tie Banh, Toan Chay, 
and other officials of the two-headed government said they were 
only moving in the direction of Anlung Veng, but had not yet 
reached the area. 
  B. Some foreign reporters and radios broadcast the 
two-headed government's (?exaggerated) report about Anlung Veng, 
while others, citing various views, said Phnom Penh troops have 
not reached the area yet. All this shows that the 
two-heads-three-eyed government is in great fear and confusion 
because it and its masters have been utterly defeated in their 
major campaigns against Anlung Veng. 
  The people are asking why the two-headed government acts 
like 
that. Because it wants to takeover and use Anlung Veng as its 
supply line to force Democratic Kampuchea to accept its three 
conditions -- accepting the three conditions means that 
Democratic Kampuchea will be destroyed. However, the turning 
point the two-headed government wanted to attain has been 
reversed; that is, it has been defeated completely on the 
battlefield [words indistinct]. 
  VII. The entire Cambodian nation and people are pleased to 
see the defeat of the Vietnamese communist puppets and the 
two-headed government on the Anlung Veng Battlefield. The NADK, 
the people, and Democratic Kampuchea have attacked and routed 
the strategies, tactics, and ambition of the Vietnamese 
communists and the alliance and their proteges who are opposed 
to the king's five points for national reconciliation. The 
people and the masses, especially those in Phnom Penh, are 
delighted to witness the defeat of the two-headed government, 
and the success of Democratic Kampuchea with this victory will 
allow the nation, people, and all patriotic forces to promote 
King Norodom Sihanouk's five-point national reconciliation plan 
[words indistinct]. 
  [Dated] 6 February 1994 
  [Signed] NADK spokesman

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 7 (YONHAP) -- North Korean supreme 
leader Kim Il-song, reiterating that his country will not 
develop nuclear weapons, called for better bilateral relations 
in a message delivered to U.S. President Bill Clinton, a Foreign 
Ministry official said Monday. 
  The message was carried to the White House by American 
evangelist Billy Graham, who visited North Korea from Jan. 
27-Feb. 1, according to Chang Chae-ryong, director-general of 
American affairs. The evangelist had gone to Pyongyang once 
before, also carrying a verbal message from a U.S. President. 
Chang was briefed on the message by U.S. Embassy officials in 
Seoul. 
  The message was not in the form of a personal letter from 
Kim 
Il-song to Clinton nor was it written by North Korean officials, 
according to Chang. Graham simply recorded Kim's reaction to 
Clinton's verbal message urging an early conclusion to the North 
Korean nuclear problem and wrote down the message himself, he 
said. 
  Kim was quoted as noting that he has said in the past North 
Korea will not develop nuclear weapons and that he wants to 
improve relations with Washington. 
  Graham added his own personal observations after talks with 
Kim Il-song which pictured the North Korean leader as being in 
comparatively "good health." He also noted that Kim was "in 
charge" of North Korea's relations with the United States, Chang 
said.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 4 (YONHAP) -- Speculation abounds 
in the U.S. capital about the content of North Korean President 
Kim Il-song's verbal message to U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
The White House officially confirmed Friday that it has 
received Kim's message through American envangelist Billy 
Graham, who visited Pyongyang last week. 
  White House Spokesperson Dee Dee Myers declined to disclose 
the content of the message. She said she simply did not know 
anything about the message delivered to anthony lake, national 
security adviser to Clinton. 
  Many diplomatic sources are said to believe that Kim's 
message could very well contain his "general wish" to see an 
improvement in bilateral relations between Washington and 
Pyongyang, rather than any concrete proposal on resolving the 
North Korean nuclear problem. 
  Nevertheless, a feeling of vague expectation was rising that 
a dramatic breakthrough may come in the stalled negotiations on 
the North Korean nuclear issue between Pyongyang and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  Regardless of Kim Il-song's message, both hawks and doves in 
the Clinton administration and politics are proceeding with 
their respective preparations for measures on the North Korean 
nuclear question. 
  On the day the Kim message was delivered, for instance, the 
U.S. representative to the United Nations briefed the five 
permanent members of the security council about the latest on 
the North Korean issue. 
  The briefing was apparently aimed at preparing the security 
council for possible reference of the North Korean question in 
case Pyongyang and the IAEA fail to reach agreement on 
inspection of North Korean facilities. 
  Billy Graham met with Kim Il-song and conveyed a brief and 
general message from clinton that the United States hoped there 
would be progress in the nuclear talks, sources said. 
  In response to this verbal message, Kim Il-song took the 
unprecedented step of replying to the U.S. President and Graham, 
who had volunteered to act as a messenger, apparently sensed the 
importance of the situation and dispatched an aide to Washington 
ahead of him carrying Kim's message. 
  The message was deivered to the White House on Friday 
morning 
and as of Friday afternoon, the U.S. State Department had not 
relayed its content to the South Korean side. 
  Many diplomatic sources say that if North Korea was to make 
a 
proposal accepting comprehensive IAEA inspections of all its 
nuclear facilities, it would do so through diplomatic channels. 
Therefore, they speculate, the chances are slim that Kim's 
message contained important and specific proposals on the 
nuclear problem. 
  Rather, Kim Il-song would probably have reiterated North 
Korea's position that it has neither the intention nor the 
ability to develop nuclear weapons, and instead spelled out ways 
to improve U.S.-North Korea relations, sources believe. 
  It goes without saying, the sources say, that Kim's message 
would not have contained the kind of "hardline tone" as an 
earlier statement by the North Korean Foreign Ministry that 
called for either "dialogue or war." After all, they say, it was 
a message from the president of one country to another. 
  In any event, the North Korean nuclear issue has reached a 
crossroad from where it can proceed either to resolution or U.N. 
sanctions. 
  If North Korea and the IAEA fail to reach agreement on 
inspections by Feb. 21, when the IAEA convenes a meeting of its 
board of directors in Vienna, the United States will have no 
choice but to take the issue to the Security Council. Friday's 
U.S. briefing of the five permanent Security Council members 
was seen as an expression of the United States' determination to 
resolve the nuclear issue. At the same time, the United States 
apparently wanted to convey "the hardline current" of the 
international community on the matter to China, Pyongyang's only 
remaining ally, which has been opposing U.N. economic sanctions 
against North Korea. But North Korea is well aware that it 
faces further isolation from the international community if it 
fails to reach some kind of compromise with the IAEA. 
  South Korea and the United States, for their part, also 
realize that there is a limit to the effectiveness of U.N. 
economic sanctions against North Korea. As a result, the 
United States and North Korea will do their utmost to avoid 
confrontation and reach a compromise. 
  In other words, North Korea is likely to make another 
proposal before Feb. 21 so that its negotiations with the IAEA 
are not broken off completely. Or, the United States and North 
Korea may resume contacts in an effort to keep their dialogue 
going. 
  From this point of view, Kim Il-song's message could be part 
of the process.

<F P=106> ["We Have No Intention To Negotiate With a Faithless </F>
Partner" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 7 (KCNA) -- The United States 
has totally reversed its promise to the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea that it would seek only an inspection for the 
continuity of safeguards, and even raised the demand for a 
"special inspection" of two military sites which have nothing to 
do with nuclear activities. 
  Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says this is a 
deliberate act of perfidy against the DPRK. 
  In a commentary titled "We Have No Intention To Negotiate 
With a Faithless Partner" the analyst says: 
  It is unequivocally stipulated in the agreement reached at 
the contact between the DPRK and the United States late last 
year that the DPRK was willing to accept an inspection purely 
for the continuity of safeguards. Such an inspection is clearly 
distinguished from routine and ad hoc inspections pursuant to 
the legal requirements of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
[NPT]. It is based on the special position of the DPRK which 
has temporarily suspended the effectiveness of its withdrawal 
from the NPT. Still less can the "special inspection" be a 
matter of argument. 
  Nevertheless, the United States is urging the DPRK to accept 
a comprehensive inspection. This cannot be construed otherwise 
than an act to intentionally render the situation complicated 
and obstruct a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue. 
  No less grave is the fact that the United States has broken 
its promise to refrain from using all forces including nuclear 
weapons and threatening the DPRK with them. This is really the 
height of impudence, a mockery of the DPRK and the negation of 
dialogue itself. 
  The United States seems to think that it can force upon 
others more than what they promised while it can break its 
promise, because it is a big power. But we can never accept 
such a notion. 
  We will not entreat the United States to keep its faith. It 
is our will to answer faith with faith, and strong arm with a 
tough stance. 
  The U.S. hardline conservatives must stop running riot, 
clearly seeing whom they are dealing with.

<F P=106> ["CPRF Secretariat Flails Kim Yong-sam Puppet Clique's </F>
Crackdown on People" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 5 (KCNA) -- The secretariat of 
the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland 
[CPRF] in its information No. 643 dated February 4 denounced the 
Kim Yong-sam group's crackdown on the farmers, students and 
other sections of people who rose in struggle against the 
agro-market opening. 
  The information says the recent bayonet and teargas 
suppression proves that the Kim Yong-sam group is a pack of rare 
traitors, fascist gangsters and foolhardy blackguards. 
  It goes on: 
  What must not be overlooked is that the traitor Kim Yong-sam 
issued a repressive order, branding the righteous struggle of 
South Korean people as "violence", and that even Kim Chong-pil, 
a remnant of the "Yusin" system, arbitrarily insulted the 
resistance of peasants, saying "to totally deny the Uruguay 
Round in the era of internationalization means that they are 
ignorant of what is going around the world." 
  As for Kim Yong-sam and Kim Chong-pil, they are the very 
ones 
who directly sold off the South Korean rice market to the United 
States. They are despicable criminals who committed a 
never-to-be-condoned arch crime against the nation. 
  Repression can by no means be almighty, the information 
says, 
stressing: 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique must immediately stop playing 
such foolish tricks as trying to prolong at the point of the 
bayonet the remaining days of the "civilian regime" now in the 
grip of a crisis and step down without delay.

  [Text] Malaysia welcomes the lifting of U.S. embargo on 
Vietnam. Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said it is 
important that Vietnam recovers from the effects of the war and 
grows to prosper just like other countries in Southeast Asia. 
  Replying to a question at an open forum with the members of 
the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Manila, he 
said Malaysia believes when countries are prosperous they are 
less likely to cause problems to their neighbors. He said 
already Vietnam is moving very forward and that is the result of 
the investment of (?southern) countries, including Malaysia. He 
feels that Malaysia should invest and help Vietnam recover so 
that it has invested in the stability of the region. In this 
way its people will become properous and buy more goods from 
Malaysia. 
  Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir is also asked on the possibility of 
bringing in the professionals from the Philippines to overcome 
the shortage in Malaysia. He said this is one area that could 
be looked into by both countries.

  [Excerpt] For the heirs to the heroism of the Vietminh, the 
bruising of the American ego by defeat in the Vietnam War had 
cut both ways. The United States, booted out of a dirt-poor 
Third World country as a neocolonial oppressor, would never 
again meddle in Indochina -- an outcome that was to dull the 
sweetness of victory into the blandness of irony in the course 
of time. Vietnam's seasoned soldiers found it hard to 
consecrate their glory in peace, and for more than a decade 
after the fall of Saigon in 1975, they strove to rule the 
regional roost, standing up to all outside pretenders. The 
exertions of military power, even after the roost was reached, 
could not still the groans of empty stomachs, however. The doi 
moi [renovation] reforms were instituted in 1986, and soon 
after, the irony of victory was made plain. Vietnam's economic 
horizons were clouded by the sore indifference of the world's 
biggest economic power. 
  Until today the injured pride of American patriotism is 
still 
refusing to heal, and upon turning its back on Indochina, 
America found it hard to forgive and forget. Thus, the 
sourpuss' fault-finding denial of diplomatic and economic good 
sense -- since the end of Cold War rivalry, U.S. policy over 
Vietnam, and by extension, the whole of Indochina, has been held 
to ransom by a handful of MIA refuseniks. How the MIA issue, 
the agitprop made out of 2,238 missing in-action servicemen 
still unaccounted for, can still sear the national conscience, 
is due to the recrudescence of Yankee pride marked by the Reagan 
presidency after years of liberal protest and self-doubt. 
  Only the right-wing America Firsters can carry the 
compulsion 
to get even as belatedly as this and assign Ann Mills Griffiths, 
executive director of the National League of Families (of MIAs) 
a central role in the highest inter-agency policy planning 
level. "Because of her, U.S. policy towards Vietnam was 
determined by the narrow -- albeit deserving -- concerns of the 
MIA families," according to a pro-normalisation advocate in 
Washington. The Clinton Administration, in spite of its eye on 
the domestic implications of foreign policy, has kept a safe 
distance from the emotive pull of the bereaved families. To the 
president's credit, he has attempted a rational tack, one 
directed at a constituency governed by the hard facts of 
economic realism. The announcement of the lifting of the 
30-year-old trade embargo was excitedly welcomed by U.S. 
businessmen in Hanoi yesterday. 
  In spite of Clinton's cleverness at political dissimulation 
-- he said the embargo's withdrawal was intended to get the 
"fullest possible accounting" of the MIAs and denied its 
practical merits -- the move is a first step towards long 
overdue normalisation. Part of this procrastination has been 
due to Clinton himself: a good-guy president who is much too 
vulnerable to angry placard-waving. No matter how it has been 
packaged and disguised, the president's hard-headed practicality 
in the Vietnam issue is a change from his usual weak-stomached 
dallying over foreign policy. Vietnam, of course, has it all to 
gain. No one is going overboard in expectations of a flood, but 
at least the door has been flung wide open. Even with the 
embargo in place, although somewhat relaxed, Vietnam obtained 
7.5 percent economic growth in 1993. Without its biggest single 
constraint, that economy could well grow by more than 10 percent 
this year. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Manila, Thurs. -- Economic cooperation between 
Malaysia and the Philippines entered more concrete terms today 
with the signing of nine memorandums of understanding (MOUs) 
involving the respective private sectors. 
  While representatives from the various companies worked on 
the details of the projects involved, officials from the two 
governments sat down to finalise details of an investment 
guarantee agreement (IGA), which may be signed in the next few 
days. Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed and 
President Fidel Ramos witnessed the signing ceremonies at the 
Malacanang Palace, the latter's official residence, here this 
afternoon. 
  Dr. Mahathir, who arrived here this afternoon for a four-day 
visit, the first by a Malaysian prime minister since the two 
countries established diplomatic ties in 1964, hailed the 
signing of the agreements as "the start of a new phase in our 
relations." "I think we have made very good progress," he told a 
joint news conference after the signings. Asked if more 
investments from Malaysia could be expected, he replied: "Yes." 
  The nine MOUs could lead to deals worth billions of ringgit. 
Apart from injecting much-needed capital into the growing 
Philippine economy, which rose by 2.3 percent last year compared 
with one per cent in 1992, the deals are also in line with 
Malaysia's policy to boost reverse investment. The MOUs, signed 
behind closed doors, are for a hotel project on Samal Island in 
Mindanao; partial acquisition of the Associated Bank; highway 
and mass transit systems construction and the implementation of 
a RM [Malaysian ringgit] 50-million waterwork project; water 
treatment for Clark Base; gaming houses; production of 
refrigerators, the construction of Metro Manila waterworks 
sewerage system; and a U.S. $72-million power plant. 
  The nine MOUs were signed between Johan Holdings Bhd. 
[Limited]/George Kent and Metropolitan Cebu Water District; 
Johan Holdings Bhd./George Kent and Bases Conversion Development 
Authority Berjaya Topgroup (HK) Ltd. and Team Asia Corp Inc.; 
Berjaya/Wy Sdn. Bhd. [Private Limited] and Fun Characters Inc.; 
Ekran Bhd. and the Philippine Department of Tourism/Philippine 
Tourism Authority; Ekran Bhd. and Associated Bank; Renong 
Bhd./Mara and Public Estates Authority; and Datuk Eugene Campos 
and Louis Cosan. 
  The signing of the MOUs reflects the determination of both 
countries to step up investment and bilateral trade after ties 
had been held back for so long by the Philippine Government's 
claim over Sabah. Malaysia's investment in the Philippines has 
been unpredictable. On an uptrend during the 1980s, investments 
dipped after 1989 and in 1992, no new capital from Malaysia 
flowed into the Philippines. 
  Last year some 193 million pesos (RM16.3 million) in 
Malaysian investments went into power generation plants, poultry 
breeding, and electronic manufacturing projects in the republic. 
  MBf Asia Capital Corp. and MCA Power Corp., together with a 
third Canadian partner, entered into a deal for a U.S. $2 
billion (RM5.5 billion) power plant irrigation and flood control 
system. Hong Leong Engineering and Sarte Teodore and Associates 
clinched a deal on the manufacturing of computer software in the 
Philippines for export. 
  Al-Bakara Malaysia also took a slice of the pie in a deal 
with a group, led by Mindanao's Mastura family to rehabilitate 
the state- owned Amanah Bank, now privatised.

  [Excerpts] Bilateral trade, economic and business ties 
between Malaysia and the Philippines are set to grow at a steady 
pace from now on with the Malaysian prime minister Dr. Mahathir 
Mohamed's official four-day visit to the Philippines which began 
on Thursday. 
  The Malaysian leader's visit can be described as historic in 
the sense that it is the first official trip by a Malaysian 
prime minister to the Philippines, since the two countries 
established diplomatic ties in 1964. It also reciprocates the 
visit of Philippine President Fidel Ramos to Malaysia last year. 
[passage omitted] 
  Dr. Mahathir's entourage includes some cabinet ministers 
holding key portfolios as well as about 60 corporate leaders and 
businessmen which demonstrates the seriousness that is being 
attached to increase economic and business cooperation. This 
cooperation entered concrete term on the very first day of the 
visit with the signing of the nine memoranda of understanding or 
MOUs, involving the private sectors of the two countries. 
  The MOUs may lead to deals worth billions of ringgit. Apart 
from injecting much-needed capital into the Philippine economy, 
the deals are also in line with Malaysia's policy to boost 
reverse investment. While the MOUs will be signed, officials of 
the two countries got down to details of an investment guarantee 
agreement, IGA, which is likely to be signed in the course of 
the visit. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Kota Kinabalu correspondent Mohamed Nor Samad] </F>
  [Text] Sabah politics are getting more and more 
interesting to watch. One event takes place after another just 
a chess game. The problem is who ends the game. 
  The climax of Sabah politics is seen in the verdict passed 
on 
Datuk Joseph Pairin Kitingan's corruption case. The court found 
him guilty of corruption but he was still allowed to run in the 
state elections and he did not have to quit his post of chief 
minister. The reason is that he was fined 1,800 ringgit and this 
saved him from Article 17 (1)(e) of the Sabah state Constitution 
and Article 48 (e) of the federal Constitution, which would have 
fined him 2,000 ringgit or put him in jail for one year. This 
would have disqualified him from running in the elections. 
  What is interesting is that not only the Sabah people, but 
also PBS [Sabah United Party] leaders and members are 
speculating that Pairin will quit the party chairman post at the 
end of his trial. Therefore, rumors have it that several PBS 
senior leaders, including Datuk Ariyah Tengku Ahmad, Datuk 
Bernard Dompok, and Datuk Joseph Kurup have been mentioned as 
potential successors of Pairin as PBS leader. 
  On the day of Pairin's court verdict, a banner saying: 
"Moyog State Constituency Wants Datuk Bernard as New Sabah 
Chief Minister" was unfurled on Karamunsing Road. With the 
sighting of the banner, people had reason to believe that a 
power struggle within PBS has begun, but this was quickly denied 
by PBS leaders. Bernard Dompok was assemblyman for the said 
constituency. 
  Datuk Clarence Bongkos Malakun, PBS deputy leader, who 
recently became more outspoken in releasing his frustations, 
disclosed that the party, established in 1985, is being split 
into two factions. As he spoke in his capacity as deputy leader, 
his remarks definitely should not be taken for granted. Bongkos 
said one faction was trying to befriend the federal government 
or the ruling National Front, while the other faction is opposed 
to it. 
  What is interesting is Bongkos' assertion that Pairin was 
actually not the person who masterminded the PBS's decision to 
leave the National Front in 1990, resulting in the strained 
relations between PBS and the National Front. Even though 
Bongkos' remarks may have ulterior motives, what is important is 
that PBS seems to have an internal rift. 
  However, both the National Front and UMNO [United Malays 
National Organization] should not be overconfident about the PBS 
alleged split because it can serve as a trap to make them lower 
their guard. If they are negligent and enjoy discussing the PBS 
internal rift, they may have to wait another five years to 
recapture Sabah. 
  If we look at the issue carefully, we can see that the main 
cause of the rift is that the majority of PBS leaders want to 
join the National Front. These leaders have realized that 
without joining the National Front, the PBS will get nowhere. 
The proof is easily visible. Ruled by the PBS in the past nine 
years, Sabah is the poorest state with the highest unemployment 
rate in Malaysia. Other states in peninsular Malaysia as well 
as Sarawak have made rapid progress in development. 
  The decision to leave the National Front may be beneficial 
in the short-term, but the PBS and Sabah people have now begun 
to realize that this is not true for the long-term. This shows 
that the decision to leave the National Front just a few days 
before the general elections in 1990, described by the National 
Front as a stab in the back, is a very risky political gamble. 
But now, on the eve of state elections on 18-19 February, 
rumors are rife that PBS wants to rejoin the National Front and 
set up a coalition government after the elections. 
  Being aware of the danger of such rumors, UMNO leaders 
quickly dismissed them. UMNO leaders, including Tan Sri Mohamed 
Taib and Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin as well as Tan Sri Abdul Rahim 
expressed doubts as to how the PBS can possibly join the 
National Front when the party has not yet submitted a formal 
application for such a purpose. Muhyiddin described the rumors 
as a dirty tactic launched by the PBS to gain sympathy votes. 
At the same time, Sabah UMNO expressed confidence that it will 
be able to set up its own state government without having to set 
up a coalition government with the PBS. 
  Political observers noted that when the PBS is cornered, the 
party will do anything possible to maintain power in the state. 
  The Chinese community in Sabah is also believed to have 
realized that under the PBS, they have been put into a 
disadvantageous position. They said they will follow the winds 
of change and vote for the National Front, whose leadership 
style is already proven. There are also talks that Chinese 
leaders in the PBS are being discriminated against. The fruits 
of development carried out by the PBS have benefitted one ethnic 
group only. An undeniable fact is that Sabah has now lagged 
behind other states in development. 
  To cope with the increasingly exciting Sabah political 
situation, Sabah UMNO must be united and act in a coordinated 
way. To play political chess against the PBS, one must be 
skillful and capable of anticipating its next move. 
  There are times when the PBS looks as if it is losing, but 
at 
the critical moment it shows its real strategy and strength and 
eventually wins the battle. This has happened three times in 
elections since the PBS has ruled Sabah, namely on 21 April 
1985, 6-7 May 1986, and 16-17 July 1990. Therefore, the 
National Front and Sabah UMNO must be doubly careful and must 
not allow the PBS to exploit any election issue. The most 
important mission is that they must hoist the National Front 
flag on top of Kinabalu Mountain. 
  The National Front must seek ways to win the hearts of the 
Sabah people and explain the government policies to them so they 
will not fall victim to PBS propaganda. 
  Everyone knows that the Sabah people themselves will 
determine what kind of government they want to elect, but those 
who live in remote and isolated areas must at least get adequate 
information to enable them to decide what is most beneficial for 
them. This is the heavy task the National Front currently has 
to face. 
  Amidst the uncertain and confused political scenario, the 
National Front must pay attention to the following issues: 
  A. If the PBS is indeed accepted into the National Front on 
the eve of state elections, will the Sabah UMNO accept the fact? 
Political observers predict that prominent PBS leaders may not 
run in the elections so that the PBS will be allowed to join the 
National Front again. 
  B. Is the PBS going to exploit the issue of Tun Datuk 
Mustapha Harun, the Sabah Father of Independence, in case he 
decides to run in the elections, or is the PBS going to nominate 
his sons against him if he decides to run? 
  C. Are the National Front and UMNO ready to cope with the 
Sabah tradition of party members changing their political 
loyalty? 
  D. If Datuk Dr. Jeffrey Kitingan, currently under 
restricted detention in Seremban, Negeri Sembilan, is allowed to 
run in the elections, are the National Front and UMNO ready for 
it?

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 8 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
military brigands recently held "a meeting of leading commanding 
officers" of the puppet Marines and cried for the maintenance of 
"top-level combat preparedness for an event of contingency," 
according to a radio report monitored here from Seoul. 
  This ill-boding war confab set us on our guard because it 
took place at a time when the U.S. hardline conservative forces 
and war-thirsty elements in the military were letting loose war 
blasts without hesitation, shouting themselves hoarse that "a 
strict reaction must be shown to North Korea" and "the United 
States must make a showdown with North Korea with arms." 
  Facts prove that the South Korean puppet clique is a group 
of 
bellicose elements who are bent on lighting the fuze of war to 
exterminate the nation, not wanting to fundamentally resolve the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. 
  However, it is a foolish dream for the South Korean war 
maniacs to overpower our republic by military force. 
  If the South Korean puppet clique recklessly start a war at 
the instigation of the outside forces, our people and the heroic 
People's Army will mete out severe punishment to them.

<F P=106> ["Sword-brandishing of Fascist Clique" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 8 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam 
puppet clique is kicking up rows of search and roundup in all 
parts of South Korea allegedly for "ferreting out leading 
elements" after bruising and arresting many demonstrators who 
fought against agricultural market opening. 
  Saying that this suppression fully reveals the shamelessness 
of the Kim Yong-sam group of traitors and its fascist nature 
more truculent than the preceding military fascist groups, an 
analyst of NODONG SINMUN today says: 
  This time, the South Korean farmers and public figures held 
a 
peasants' rally and a daring demonstration. They were an 
entirely just struggle to defend the sovereignty of the nation 
and the vital interests of the South Korean farmers. They could 
not be a target of suppression at all. 
  If there is one blamable, he is none other than the traitor 
Kim Yong-sam who threw away his "promise" to "defend" the rice 
market by staking his "presidency" and sold off the South Korean 
rice market to the U.S. masters for "an international 
cooperation system" intended to do harm to the fellow countrymen 
in the North. 
  However, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, the very criminal, 
is brandishing the sword, incriminating the demonstrators who 
are out to defend the interests of the nation. It is a group of 
traitors without parallel in history and a gang of ignorant 
fascist hooligans. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique must step down, discontinuing 
the foolish gamble to bridge over the "government" crisis and 
prolong its remaining days at the point of the fascist bayonet.

<F P=106> ["Traitor Kim Yong-sam Must Step Down: KSC" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 7 (KCNA) -- The Korean Student 
Committee [KSC] in a statement February 6 branded the savage 
crackdown upon the struggle of South Korean students and farmers 
for protecting the rice market as a dastardly and inhuman crime 
which can be committed only by such despicable traitors and 
political prostitutes as the Kim Yong-sam group. 
  The statement said: 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam, a political charlatan and 
impostor, 
had once promised that he would "protect" the rice market by 
staking his "presidency". But, throwing away this promise like 
a pair of old shoes, he sold off the agricultural market vital 
to the South Korean peasants and people to the U.S. masters and 
is ruthlessly suppressing the struggle of students and farmers 
to defend it. What can be expected from such a renegade of 
democracy and traitor to the nation? 
  The present reality shows that, with the Kim Yong-sam puppet 
clique left in power, the desire of the South Korean people and 
students for independence, democracy and reunification cannot be 
realised and their existence itself will be jeopardized. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam should step down before he meets a 
miserable end, not forgetting what doom his predecessors met 
while brandishing the bayonet at the people. 
  The statement called upon the South Korean students, 
peasants 
and other people to hold the flag of the patriotic struggle as 
high as ever to overthrow the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, guard 
the agricultural market and defend the dignity and interests of 
the nation.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 6 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) in a 
statement Friday denounced the traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique's 
brutal suppression of the struggle of peasants and people of 
other strata against farm market opening, Seoul-based radio 
Voice of National Salvation [VNS] reported. 
  The statement says the courageous turnout of the peasants 
and 
other people in a struggle for defence of the nation's 
foundation for existence is an entirely righteous patriotic 
action. 
  It strongly demands that the Kim Yong-sam group of traitors 
admit and apologize for its anti-popular criminal act, 
immediately release the arrested peasants and students and 
promptly stop the desperate search. 
  Such a thorough-paced pro-American flunkeyist traitor and 
fascist maniac as Kim Yong-sam can find no shelter in this land, 
the statement says. 
  The only way out for the peasants and people of other strata 
is to overthrow the fascist "civilian" regime and establish an 
independent democratic government, stresses the statement.

puppet troops took a position in Nosang-ri, Ogum-ri and 
Yongsan-ri, Paju County, and fired more than 1,000 large-calibre 
machinegun and automatic rifle bullets. 
  Meanwhile, ten odd helicopter gunboats and transport 
helicopters of the puppet Army staged exercises of supporting 
ground force units, parachuting "commandoes" and airlifting 
combat equipment in the skies above Yonchon and Pochon, Kyonggi 
Province, and Chupha-ri, Chorwon County, South Korean Kangwon 
Province.

nine South Korean Peasants Organisations including the National 
Federation of Peasants Associations (Chonnong) jointly called a 
press conference on February 4 and opposed again the farm market 
opening, according to a radio report from Seoul. 
  They demanded that the puppet authorities leave the blanks 
of 
15 basic farm products including rice unfilled when presenting 
the final enforcement plan for Uruguay Round market opening, 
which is scheduled on February 15. 
  They declared that they would wage a struggle throughout 
South Korea if their demand were not accepted by the authorities. 
  They warned that the puppet authorities would face a greater 
resistance if the latter dealt with by law those arrested in the 
demonstration on February 1.

market, defying suppression by the traitor Kim Yong-sam clique. 
  "The ruin of agriculture subsequent upon market opening 
would 
cause serious problems including environmental pollution and 
destruction of culture," warned the ralliers in a statement, 
strongly urging the puppet authorities to have a "Uruguay Round 
Renegotiation". 
  Meanwhile, students and members of labour organizations held 
a protest against the agricultural market opening in front of 
Seoul railway station and launched a signature campaign amid the 
active response of citizens.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 6 (KCNA) -- The Central 
Committee of the Union of Agricultural Working People of Korea 
in a statement Saturday sharply denounced the South Korean 
puppet clique's suppression of the peaceful demonstrators 
protesting against the opening of the rice market on Feb. 1, as 
a brutal fascist repression infringing upon the elementary vital 
rights and democratic freedom on the peasants and people of 
other walks of life. 
  Recalling that the puppet clique of Kim Yong-sam, the 
traitor 
for all ages, is resorting to a wholesale crackdown, branding 
the peaceful protests for defending the nation's dignity and 
interests as "violence", the statement says the current struggle 
of the South Korean peasants and students is by no means 
"violence". 
  The real violence is the brutalities of the fascist clique 
which is madly wielding the bayonet at the bare-handed peaceful 
demonstrators and its boss is none other than the traitor Kim 
Yong-sam, it points out. The statement calls upon the South 
Korean peasants and students to wage a more daring struggle to 
overthrow the treacherous Kim Yong-sam puppet regime and 
establish a truly independent democratic government, in close 
solidarity and unity with people of all other strata, holding 
high the banner of struggle against outside forces and puppets, 
which they have raised.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 8 (KCNA) -- "Lawmakers" from the 
opposition Democratic Party, National Party and New Hanguk Party 
of South Korea held an emergency joint meeting at the "National 
Assembly" on February 5 and published a joint statement 
demanding "renegotiation of the Uruguay Round", a Seoul-based 
radio report said. 
  In the statement they shared the view that they should fight 
it out to prevent the agricultural market opening which would 
drive the South Korean agriculture into bankruptcy, and urged 
the authorities to leave unfilled blanks of the final plan for 
the enforcement of the opening which was due to be submitted by 
February 15. 
  They also declared that they would fight in concert to 
prevent a "parliamentary ratification" of the agro-market 
opening.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 8 (KCNA) -- Affiliates of the 
South Korean Council for Measures on the Volunteers Corps 
Problem (Chongdaehyop) which comprises 18 organizations have 
made it a rule to stage a demonstration in front of the Japanese 
Embassy in Seoul every Wednesday since January, 1992, demanding 
compensation for the damages done to "comfort women for the 
Army", a South Korean newspaper reported. 
  The number of demonstrations had exceeded 100 by the end of 
December last year. 
  The protests involved members of Chongdaehyop, the National 
Alliance for Democracy and Reunification (Chongukyonhap) and 
other organizations. 
  They shouted toward the embassy: "Japanese Government, probe 
the truth behind the `comfort women for the Army' issue and make 
an official apology and compensation". "Our angry shouts will 
not cease till a genuine apology and compensation of the 
Japanese Government for the wartime crime have been made", they 
warned.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 8 (KCNA) -- South Korean people 
are lauding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il who is wisely 
leading the people with his distinguished ideas and theories, 
brilliant wisdom and rare insight. 
  A dissident residing in Myongdong, Seoul, told his fellows 
that it was, indeed, a great fortune of the nation to have a 
marshal in the person of Mr. Kim Chong-il, a famous general with 
perfect literary and military accomplishments, loyalty and 
filial piety, a famous general who descended from the heaven. 
  A professor of Seoul National University surnamed Yi said: 
  "When you read works authored by Secretary Kim Chong-il you 
can see that he is, indeed, an extraordinary thinker and 
theoretician. When you see the socialism of the North you can 
understand that he is, indeed, a great statesman. The fact that 
the North stands against the United States, a superpower, 
eloquently tells that he is, indeed, an outstanding military 
strategist. 
  "He is, indeed, the great of great." 
  A lieutenant of the puppet Army surnamed Kim said there is 
no 
other Army in the world like the North's which is guided by a 
great statesman, an iron-willed brilliant commander equipped 
with literary and military accomplishments. "It is an honour and 
pride not only of our people but of the world people to have 
acclaimed Supreme Commander Kim Chong-il as a marshal," he 
stressed. 
  An intellectual in Pusan surnamed Kim told his colleagues: 
  "Mr. Kim Chong-il is a peerless great man with clairvoyant 
wisdom, rare resourcefulness and noble virtues. 
  "Let all of us live and fight with fortitude to be embraced 
in his bosom."

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 6 (KCNA) -- The deputy spokesman 
for the South Korean opposition Democratic Party in a statement 
February 4 urged the puppet authorities to probe a scandal 
committed by the traitor Chon Tu-hwan's younger brother, Chon 
Kyong-hwan, in the period of the "Fifth Republic", according to 
a radio report from Seoul. 
  Calling attention to the exposure of the fact that Chon 
Kyong-hwan grabbed by forcible means more than 122,000 phyong 
(one phyong equals six feet square) of land around Yongjongdo, 
Inchon city, the ownership of which he claimed and filed a suit 
for it, the deputy spokesman said the money he paid in buying 
the vast tract of land must be an ill-gotten money. 
  And he urged an immediate investigation into all the 
injustices committed by Chon Kyong-hwan in-mobilizing 
"government officials" in the forcible purchase of the land.

<F P=106> ["Japanese Reactionaries Must Immediately Stop Anti-DPRK </F>
Smear Campaign" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 8 (KCNA) -- Ozawa, 
representative of the Japan Renewal Party (Shinseito), 
reportedly appeared on the TV scene on February 6 and spun out a 
string of spiteful words against the DPRK, saying "North Korea 
has already completed nuclear weapons" and it "has no doubt 
equipped itself with nuclear arms". 
  This is malicious slander and unpardonable, open challenge 
to 
the peaceloving DPRK which has no nuclear arms. 
  Ozawa unhesitatingly spread the fiction of "nuclear 
armament", going far beyond the limit of "nuclear suspicion" 
against the DPRK over which the Japanese reactionaries have 
raised a hue and cry up until now. Judging from this, one can 
see to what extremes their anti-DPRK intrigues have gone. 
  Ozawa made such tricky remarks adding fuel to fire at a time 
when a grave crisis that might push the situation to a 
catastrophic phase has been created due to the despicable 
perfidy of the United States, prompted by an extremely sinister 
intention to force the DPRK at any cost to accept the demand of 
the Secretariat of the International Atomic Energy Agency for a 
total inspection, and seek international "sanctions" and 
pressure to isolate and stifle the DPRK by misleading world 
opinion. 
  It is not hard to gather that lurking behind it is also a 
wicked intention to justify Japan's nuclear armament and design 
to turn it into a nuclear power and hasten this in real earnest 
by spreading the fiction of the North's "nuclear armament". 
  Japan launched a large nuclear-capable carrier rocket H-2 on 
February 4 and is soon to ignite Monju, its first fast breeder 
reactor. A series of facts clearly prove in practice that the 
Japanese reactionaries' moves toward a nuclear power now are 
being stepped up in a very grave phase. 
  This is, indeed, a grave obstacle to the denuclearization of 
Northeast Asia including the Korean peninsula and poses a big 
threat to the Korean and other Asian people. 
  The Japanese reactionaries' stepped-up nuclear armament is 
aimed at gratifying their criminal design of overseas aggression 
the first target of which is the Korean peninsula. 
  Such aggressive design of theirs was fully manifested in the 
fact that Ozawa made no scruples of uttering meaningful words 
saying Japan's countermeasure for the event of "contingency" on 
the Korean peninsula should be examined. 
  It is as foolish as trying to destroy a rock with their 
heads 
to attempt to stretch their tentacles of reinvasion against the 
DPRK in collusion with the United States. 
  We are following with heightened revolutionary vigilance 
their anti-DPRK, anti-socialist moves, and our people and 
People's Army will never pardon those who try to infringe on 
their national sovereignty and dignity. 
  The Japanese reactionaries must look squarely at the 
steadfast will and determination of the Korean people and act 
with discretion and promptly stop the anti-DPRK intrigues.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 7 (KCNA) -- The Bulgarian paper 
TRIBUNA January 31 carried an article entitled "Great Man Who 
Leads Socialist Movement to Victory". 
  The article says: 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il, member of the Presidium of the 
Political Bureau and secretary of the Central Committee of the 
Workers' Party of Korea, saw to it that the Pyongyang 
declaration was made public, considerate of the realities that 
many parties are groping their way how to rebuild the socialist 
movement under the condition that socialism suffered setbacks in 
some countries. 
  Heads and representatives of the political parties desirous 
of socialism including many communist and workers' parties all 
over the world got together and adopted the historic Pyongyang 
declaration "Let us defend and advance the cause of socialism" 
in Pyongyang in April 1992. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il is directing deep attention to 
strengthening the motive force of the socialist movement. 
  He said that to strengthen the motive force of revolution it 
is imperative to strengthen the working-class party and enhance 
its leadership role. 
  He published in recent years his works "The Workers' Party 
of 
Korea Organizes and Guides All the Victories of our People", 
"Our Socialism Centred on the Masses Shall Not Perish" and "On 
the Fundamentals of Revolutionary Party Building" in which he 
put forward fundamental principles that should be maintained in 
the building and activities of the working-class party to build 
a new revolutionary party capable of rebuilding the socialist 
movement and the ways for their implementation and gave correct 
answers to many theoretical and practical matters arising in the 
international arena, thus making undying contributions to the 
development of the socialist movement. 
  The Workers' Party and the people of Korea now under the 
guidance of Comrade Kim Chong-il are determinedly defending and 
maintaining the Korean-style socialism and bringing the 
advantages and vitality of socialism into full play with the 
might of the singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and 
the masses.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 8 (KCNA) -- Symposiums were held 
at party cadres training centres and in social science and 
educational domains on February 7 to mark the 20th anniversary 
of the proclamation of the programme of modelling the whole of 
society on the chuche idea. 
  The programme which was set forth by the dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il on February 19, 1974 indicated for the first time 
in the history of the communist movement an ideological and 
theoretical guideline which should be invariably applied in the 
building of a working-class party and gave comprehensive answers 
to theoretical and practical questions arising in building the 
party into an invincible one through the modelling of the whole 
of it on the chuche idea. 
  The speakers at the symposium of party cadres training 
centres said that the programme of modelling the whole society 
on the chuche idea is a great one indicating the most clear 
target in the revolutionary struggle for independence and a 
scientific way for its attainment and a revolutionary one which 
opened the road for a new historical march for the strengthening 
and development of the party and for the triumphant advance of 
the revolution. 
  At the symposium in the social science sector, the speakers 
said the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il put forward the 
programme of imbuing the whole society with the chuche idea and 
formulated the revolutionary idea of the great leader Comrade 
Kim Il-song and this was a historical event of epochal 
significance in the development of the revolutionary idea of the 
working class and in the accomplishment of the revolutionary 
cause. 
  The speakers at the symposium in the educational domain said 
that the programme not only indicated the objective and 
orientation of socialist education but also showed the contents 
and methods of education to bring up the rising generation into 
true revolutionaries of chuche type with an independent ideology 
and a high degree of creativity by directing primary efforts to 
political and ideological education and properly combining it 
with scientific and technological education.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 8 (KCNA) -- Coal mines in Korea 
in January produced nearly one million more tons of coal than 
the previous month and are expanding the success this month. 
  In the first five days of this month the Sunchon and Anju 
District coal mining complexes increased coal output 
respectively 11 and 8 percent as against the like period of the 
previous month. 
  The Tokchon District coal mining complex is carrying out its 
daily plans at more than 130 percent by introducing new blasting 
methods and improving the operation rate of cutting faces. 
  The Kangso District general coal mining enterprise which had 
hit the January coal target over ten days ahead of schedule is 
now producing daily several hundred more tons of coal than 
planned this month by giving precedence to tunneling and well 
managing coal-cutting faces. 
  The Kangdong, Pukchang and Myongchon District coal mining 
complexes have lifted the daily coal output 20 percent above 
that in the corresponding period of last month by scrupulously 
organizing and directing production.

  [Text] Prime Minister Paul Keating has described as 
outrageous and tragic the weekend shelling attack on Sarajevo. 
The UN secretary general, Butrus Butrus-Ghali, has asked NATO 
to authorize air strikes against Serb artillery in Bosnia 
following the mortar bomb attack on a crowded Sarajevo market 
place. Mr. Keating says the conflict is outside Australia's 
sphere of influence and a matter mainly for the United Nations 
and Europeans. He says Foreign Minister Gareth Evans will be 
seeking advice from the U.S. and Europe about their intentions 
and the prospects for a diplomatic resolution. 
  [Begin Keating recording] Where any further consideration 
goes on the part of other participants in the United Nations 
about arming one side of the conflict against another, or, in 
fact, taking military action is a matter for a closer judgement 
than I think we are able to bring from this distance. [end

<F P=106> [From the "International Report" program"] </F>
  [Text] Australia has promised its support for any United 
Nations decision on air strikes. However, Foreign Minister 
Gareth Evans says there are still reasons for caution. Senator 
Evans told Radio Australia's Linda Curtis in Canberra that the 
decision on air strikes is getting closer. 
  [Begin recording] [Evans] Well, clearly, we are a lot closer 
to that than we were just 24 hours ago and that is sending, 
equally obviously, a very clear message to the Bosnian Serbs, 
who are now talking yet again about the voluntary 
demilitarization of the area. If that result can be achieved 
without opening up the potential downward spiral of violence 
that might flow from air strikes and which has been worrying 
everybody up until now, then that is, of course, a very good 
result indeed. 
  [Curtis] So, there are still fairly strong reasons for 
caution on air strikes? 
  [Evans] That is the problem. There is a tremendous urge, 
which I certainly feel and I am sure people around the world 
feel, that we ought to be doing something to respond to this 
carnage and to stop it happening again in the future, but the 
problem is that it is very difficult to guarantee that result 
through military operations of this kind. 
  You have got the effectiveness problem that is actually 
winkling out the batteries around the city; you have got the 
problem of keeping them silent when the military analysts say 
that it would take up to 50,000 troops permanently stationed 
there to do that; you have got the problem of retaliatory 
violence occuring elsewhere around Bosnia. There is only 11,000 
UN troops there at the moment and they are supervising the 
feeding of some 2 million people at the moment. And, if it 
makes it impossible for them to do their job, you may well at 
the end of the day be creating even more misery, implausible as 
that sounds, than has been generated by the continuing attacks 
on Sarajevo. So, it is a very difficult finely balanced 
equation, and what we have been saying is that we just simply 
can't make those judgements from this distance without our own 
people on the ground, but we will back the judgements of those 
that are closer to the action. 
  [Curtis] Is it time for NATO to back up its rhetoric? It 
has threatened air strikes in the past? 
  [Evans] Well, undoubtedly it would. But the question you 
have to then ask is what happens next. Will it plunge the 
country into a cycle of retaliatory violence which will end up 
creating net additions to the sum of human misery in that 
country? There was tremendous enthusiasm for rushing in in 
Somalia -- you may remember in the middle of last year, and 
shooting up that awful General Aidid for the terrible things 
that he was doing -- and the net result of that was to create 
three months of absolute chaos on the ground, many, many deaths 
being caused and absolutely no advance in the overall 
politico-military situation. And those lessons have to be 
learned carefully and those around the world who are rushing 
into print with robust commentary about how wimpish everyone has 
been, I think very often they are just not making those kinds of 
calculations. They are very tough, they are very finely 
balanced. [end recording]

  [Text] A master plan to make the dream of a new Sabah a 
reality was unveiled today. The people of Sabah have been 
invited to join other Malaysians in enjoying the economic 
prosperity the rest of the country is under going. This is 
contained in the Barisan Nasional [BN] or National Front 
manifesto which was announced in Kota Kinabalu this morning. The 
BN promises to raise the economic performance of Sabah within 
100 days if the coalition elected to form the next state 
government. 
  The 10-point master plan promises a higher growth rate 
compared to only 4.4 percent for Sabah state at present. The per 
capita income will also be increased to 10,000 ringgit by the 
year 2000 compared to only 3,600 ringgit now. The BN says the 
government will allocate at least 700 million ringgit in a 
seven-year period for the construction of low-cost houses. It is 
the dream of the BN that every Sabahan will own a house by the 
year 2000. 
  The manifesto invites the people of Sabah to be with other 
Malaysians to forge ahead in a new prosperous era under one 
country, one government and one region. The theme of the BN 
mandate is Mandate for a New Sabah.

  [Excerpt] Labuan, 20 January -- Sabah Foundation Director 
Datuk Dr. Jeffrey Kitingan, just released from house arrest, 
said last night that relations between Kuala Lumpur and Sabah 
would improve. 
  Speaking to reporters during a stopover here on his way to 
Kota Kinabalu, he said: "We managed to get the message across, 
and the leaders in Kuala Lumpur now understand our problems. 
These problems have plagued the state over the past few years. 
I believe everyone knows that the best way to solve them is 
through cooperation." He said there are several leaders in 
Sabah and Kuala Lumpur who want to restore relations and work 
together again. "We all accept Vision 2020 [national 
development plan]; we must set aside our political differences 
and work together," he said. 
  Jeffrey Kitingan, the younger brother of Sabah Chief 
Minister 
Pairin Kitingan, declined to elaborate further on the matter, 
noting that he was returning to Sabah to assist the PBS [Sabah 
United Party] in the upcoming state elections on 18-19 February. 
The latest reports say that Jeffrey will run in the Bingkor 
constituency. He is also expected to strengthen Pairin's 
leadership and solve the PBS's internal problems. [passage

  [Excerpt] Kota Kinabalu, Sat. -- Leaders of the 
deregistered USNO [United Sabah National Organization] led by 
Datuk Amirkahar Tun Mustapha have joined the Parti Bersatu Sabah 
[Sabah United Party, PBS] to contest the state elections under 
the PBS banner. Amirkahar, who is the former USNO president, and 
other officials have been submitting their membership forms to 
PBS President Datuk Sri Joseph Pairin Kitingan over the past few 
days. 
  Pairin confirmed today that they have become full-fledged 
members of the PBS since the party constitution requires that 
those standing on a PBS ticket must be a party member. "It is a 
temporary measure to comply with the PBS constitution," he told 
reporters here after witnessing the Sabah Premier League players 
sign their contract with the State Football Association. Pairin 
said once the election was over, these leaders could resign from 
the PBS and join USNO Baru [New] or any other party. "If USNO 
Baru is registered, they can resign from the PBS and join USNO 
Baru. There is nothing complicated about it," he said. Pairin 
said the move to make them members was not to force them to 
remain in the PBS. 
  When contacted today, PBS-Plus Codirector of Operations 
Mohamed Naser Mohamed Noor who quit his post yesterday, said 
there was no longer a PBS-Plus grouping and Amirkahar's group 
had betrayed their supporters by joining the PBS. Naser, who was 
the political secretary to Amirkahar, said the move would result 
in thousands of USNO supporters abandoning their support for 
Amirkahar and his group. He said he would work hard to ensure 
these supporters back the Barisan Nasional [National Front].

  [Text] People have asked this question: The United States 
has set itself up as the defender of human rights. Why then 
does the U.S. Government embrace the puppet of the Vietnamese 
communists named Sin Song, great murderer and criminal, and let 
him go to the United States? 
  It has been reported that the U.S. State Department has 
issued a visa to Vietnamese communist puppet Sin Song to travel 
to the United States. This report, picked up from Western 
foreign news agencies, says that Sin Song is a murderer. He 
killed over 400 members of various political parties and 
arrested over 3,000 others during the May 1993 pre-election 
period. The Cambodian nation and people still clearly remember 
that before the May 1993 elections, puppet Sin Sing was the 
security chief of Vietnam's puppets. He has mistreated, 
arrested, and executed hundreds of people and members of various 
political parties. Furthermore, in July 1993 puppet Sin Song 
led the movement of seven eastern provinces to secede from 
Cambodia and opposed the national reconciliation plan offered by 
the prince father [Sihanouk]. 
  The Cambodian nation and people have condemned the 
Vietnamese 
communist puppet Sin Song as a great criminal and murderer, who 
kills the Cambodian nation and people, and as a traitor. The 
way the United States has embraced the puppet Sin Song has made 
people ask this question: The United States have set themselves 
up as defenders of human rights. Why then does the U.S. 
Government issue a visa to the Vietnamese communist puppet Sin 
Song, great criminal and murderer, to travel to the United 
States?

  [Text] Jakarta, Feb. 8 (ANTARA) -- Indonesia condemned on 
Monday the bombing by Serbs of a civilian target, killing 68 
people in Sarajevo on Saturday last week. An official statement 
issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the shelling 
by Serbs of a busy market in Sarajevo was an act against the 
norms which respect human dignity. The attack, which wounded 200 
innocent people, must be condemned as it constituted a brutal 
act, unacceptable to civilised people, the statement said. 
  "This incident should call for the attention of the 
international community that settlement of conflict in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is now on a very pressing stage," the 
statement said. 
  Strong reactions also came from other countries such as the 
Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC), China, Pakistan, 
Bangladesh. Germany, France, the United States, and Turkey, in 
principle, they called on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
(NATO) to launch an air strike for the liberation of Sarajevo 
from the siege of Bosnian Serbs, the daily said. [paragraph as

  [Text] Dili, Feb 8 (ANTARA) -- East Timor Governor Abilio 
Jose Osorio Soares said on Monday that the proposal by 
Australia, Britain and Canada to the UN secretary general for 
Indonesia to withdraw its troops from the province should not be 
taken seriously. "The Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI) play a very 
important function in the welfare of the people," said Soares 
before leaving for Denpasar to attend the inauguration of the 
new Bali-based Udayana regional military commander. He said 
ABRI's territorial operation in East Timor was different from 
those in Europe which was mostly aimed at military purposes. 
  Noting that several western countries have often misjudged 
ABRI's role in the province, the governor said, "They view the 
presence of the troops as a violation of human rights." 
According to him, the East Timorese in fact welcome the troops 
stationed there in order to maintain security and train the 
residents in skills needed to develop the province. 
  He believed the Western countries would be very surprised to 
learn that ABRI soldiers did not carry any weapons but a mattock 
instead. "The troops work with the locals to build roads, farms, 
churches, mosques and other places of worhip." The governor 
stressed that the provincial administration and residents have 
never objected to the presence of ABRI troops. "It is always the 
Westerners that like to create an issue," he added. 
  However, Soares also said the troops would be pulled out 
gradually unless the locals wanted otherwise. "If they are still 
needed, they will stay," he said, adding that the troops would 
be withdrawn completely by 1995, on condition that the province 
showed progress.

<F P=106> [Weekly news conference by President Fidel V. Ramos with </F>
domestic and foreign correspondents at Malacanang Palace in 
Manila -- live; italicized passages in Tagalog] 
  [Excerpts] [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, how will the 
government's development projects be affected by the suspension 
of the oil price increase, considering that the reason for the 
imposition of the one-peso oil levy is for the government's 
infrastructure projects? 
  [Ramos] Well, the estimate of the finance people, the 
revenue people is that, under the present parameters, a 
one-month suspension would amount to the loss of about P1.2 
billion [Philippine pesos] in revenues. But precisely 
government agreed to this three-week suspension. It's really a 
three-week suspension -- from today 7 February to 28 February -- 
21 days, because we feel there could be some alternatives, new 
ones, alternatives that have not yet been factored into their 
original computations. Example, is the P1.9 million saving that 
is going to arise out of the 5 percent additional reserve that I 
imposed on the MOOE [expansion unknown] of all government 
departments, agencies, and offices. 
  Another possible alternative could be a recomputation of the 
oil price hikes, because we are seeing, and this is based on 
some very intensive study that we made over the weekend up to 
early this morning, including myself, we are seeing a plus-21 
centavos in all of the computations arising out of the lower 
price of crude oil in the world market and the stable foreign 
exchange rate -- the pesos versus the hard currencies including 
the dollar. 
  There are other alternatives of course that were suggested, 
such as the so-called P150 billion supposedly in the vaults of 
the Central Bank. But the secretary of finance, Secretary Bobby 
de Ocampo mentioned that this is tantamount to just printing 
paper bills without any backing; and so, they are going to look 
into that also, just to be sure. And I'm talking about the 
entire committee of 14. 
  Other possible resources could come from still unfactored 
privatization benefits. I say unfactored because most of the 
government assets already scheduled to be privatized, and the 
processes are ongoing, were already considered in the 
computations of the fiscal gap. 
  We also, I suppose, can derive some resources, although this 
is probably already going to be marginal, from further belt 
tightening. But we do not want to touch what we have already 
programmed for capital expenditures and infradevelopment 
programs because that would be of a negative effect toward 
investors who want to come to the Philippines. We must enhance 
our infrastructure. We have enhanced already the power 
situation, so that there are no more brownouts. That kind of 
thing, we will pursue. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, point of clarification, 
the one suspended was the oil price, the 28 January oil price 
hike. But how about the one-peso levy which was imposed last 
September? 
  [Ramos] It is the oil price hike that is suspended, it is 
not quite a rollback yet, but suspended for a period of three 
weeks, while the joint committee is working on the longer-term 
solutions. And, we are inputting all the suggestions from all 
sectors, especially the KRB [Kilusang Rollback or Rollback 
Movement] and government, and for others, because there were 
others here who were neither connected with government nor with 
KRB who spoke their opinions. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] How about the one-peso oil levy 
which was contained in the executive order? 
  [Ramos] Well, that will now be considered by the committee. 
The disposition or future of that one peso levy will also be 
thrown into the deliberations of the committee because their 
mission is to come up with a long term and enduring and just 
solution to our perennial problem of deficit. It is really the 
consolidated public sector deficit that we must solve. 
  Now, the secretary of finance showed a trend of the behavior 
of the consolidated public sector deficit. Will you kindly 
provide them a copy of this [addressing a government official], 
and it does show a downtrend, very, very significant downtrend 
from the time this administration took over. That is the 
permanent or enduring way of preventing inflation, interest 
rates, and foreign exchange rates from running away, to the 
detriment of the economy and our people. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, one thing more; with the 
suspension of the 28 January oil price hike, does it mean that 
the planned second round of increases will not push through 
anymore? 
  [Ramos] The committee will look into that because neither 
the committee nor the president can tell the ERB [Energy 
Regulatory Board] what to do. We are all suggesting to the ERB 
these proposed actions and solutions. Of course, the collective 
influence and clout now of this committee supported by the 
president would be so much that perhaps the ERB would 
immediately respond positively to the two resolutions. In fact, 
Secretary Lazaro on the part of the government was assigned by 
me to follow up with the ERB their response to these two 
resolutions. Why Lazaro, not because he is the boss of ERB or 
the supervisor of ERB, but it is his department that is most 
closely related to the ERB because of their functions. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, thank you. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, may I inquire why did it 
take the threat of a transport strike and a massive [labor] 
strike and a massing of protest to prompt government to 
implement that suspension of the oil price hike? 
  [Ramos] Well, of course the threat cannot be minimized. 
And this is coming from a broad coalition of forces -- from the 
extreme left to the extreme right -- as the KRB themselves 
described it. But it is also a part that government has been 
conducting dialogues with the leaders of congress on both sides, 
the multisectoral basic sectors as they are called, meaning the 
urban poor, the rural poor, the disabled, the women, the 
farmers, the fishermen, since we had the social pact of 8 
September 1993. And our principal action officers here are 
Secretary Oscar Santos of the Peace Process Office, and 
Secretary Ernie Garilao of the Department of Agrarian Reform. 
In fact, tomorrow we are scheduled to have another meeting with 
that group here in Malacanang. 
  What I'm trying to say is that because of these dialogues, 
we 
feel comfortable with the so-called marginalized sectors of our 
society. But since they have joined this broad coalition, we 
also want them to get the message from the government that 
certain hard decisions are being made. At the same time, we 
want to hear directly from them again what are their most urgent 
concerns. And so, we are acting on the basis of our own 
well-studied decisions and conclusions. 
  I'm not doing this under the guns, so to speak. There were 
some comments even by some of you, that this was done because 
the IMF was here. No, again I say, and this was clarified by 
the chairman of our Philippine negotiating team as well as 
Secretary of Finance Bobby de Ocampo who was part of that team, 
that what was presented to the IMF was the Philippine 
Government's plan of action up to year 1998 and into the 21st 
century which would do many good things. Number one, put us on 
the growth path. Secondly, effect what would be an exit program 
for the Philippines in relation to the IMF, and bridge the 
fiscal deficit that has been perennially bugging our economy. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, follow-up question: Isn't 
the preferred solution something like the perennial creation of 
another committee to meet the problem, and there has been some 
criticisms aired that this suspension is just delaying what is 
really inevitable? 
  [Ramos] I think that is a mindset that we should correct now 
because if there is a new committee to tackle a problem, 
your usual response is, there he goes again. There 
is a need at this time to facilitate coordination and to open 
lines of communication. And in this particular case, the joint 
committee was agreed to, not because the president ordered it. 
The suggestion in fact came from somebody in the private sector 
seconded by another one, I think it was Ronnie Concepcion, and 
so we picked it up as a means to gain time for the study of a 
comprehensive and enduring solution to this problem because 
that's really our task. 
  Our task is not to avoid a strike, although if we 
can avoid it, so much the better for everyone. But we want to 
get out of this perennial problem of fiscal deficit. And the 
committee now precisely, has been empowered by their respective 
constituents to get into both the short-term and the long-term 
solutions. That is why a period of three weeks was agreed upon. 
Government wanted about two weeks because government felt that 
would be sufficient time for consultations and coordination. 
The ERB wanted one month. Well, the two sides just split the 
difference and we came up with three weeks which coincidentally 
falls at the end of the month -- 28th of February. 
  [Phone-in question read by Press Secretary Jesus Sison] We 
have a telephone question, Mr. President, from Ditas Gualberto. 
She wants to find out if the prices will be automatically 
lowered with the suspension. 
  [Ramos] About the transportation fare, if the Land 
Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board will respond to 
the request of the joint committee, I think it will also be 
reduced because that came out with the oil price increase 
which involved P1.55 for gasoline and some other prices for 
other types of petroleum products. The other components that go 
into pricing, well, market forces will play, but I would like to 
assure the consuming public that we do have a very effective 
price monitoring system now. This is under the Department of 
Trade and Industry basically, but this is now being assisted by 
the local government executives who have been ordered by me to 
monitor prices and prevent and punish, even profiteering. 
What is profiteering -- a 10 percent or more 
increase of the price of a commodity over the average increase 
of the month before. 
  [Phone-in question read by Press Secretary Jesus Sison] 
Another question from Iloilo, Mr. President, Radyo ng Bayan 
[People's Radio], Rene Monteclaro: What is the president 
planning to do to restore the citizen's trust on those that will 
be implementing the projects wherein the source of funds comes 
from the oil levy? 
  [Ramos] Our projects will continue. I think you will 
believe this because the president has proof. You just look at 
the result of our investments in power plants; the 
rehabilitation of roads, bridges; restoration of public 
utilities destroyed or damaged during the calamities; 
improvement in our telecommunication system, transportation 
system. They are very visible on the ground. 
  We will not lessen the capital outlay because it 
already has an allocation in the 1994 General Appropriations 
Act. Nevertheless, we will add the BOT [Build-Operate-Transfer] 
component, and that will come from the private sector. If the 
society is in order, if the so-called economic policy 
environment is steady, predictable, continuous, and 
would give a fair return on investment to the investors, 
the BOT area for projects may widen. 
  We have already issued data portfolio on what are 
the doable [as heard] BOT projects all over the country divided 
into transport, power, communications, and geographically -- 
region one to region 15. 
  [Press Secretary Jesus Sison] Second question sir, [from 
Monteclaro] What are the chances that Congress will pass 
the tax measures so that the oil levy will be scrapped? 
  [Ramos] Since September, the Executive and Legislative 
have already agreed on what should be given priority among 
the various legislative proposals proposed by the senators and 
the congressmen themselves proposed by the executive branch and 
also recommended by the multisectoral people's organizations. 
In fact, 93 such bills came out of that Social Pact, so-called 
summit last 8 September. Overtime, that has been refined to a 
really, top, top priority of 15 bills which both houses of 
Congress has committed over and over again, since even before 
they resumed their session on 24 January. And I want to 
read these priority bills so that our people will know that we 
are not only talking about tax measures but enhancement of 
the economic environment, enhancement of the revenue effort, and 
these are the following: 
  -- Amendment to the BOT law. So that we can have other 
arrangements for firming up and completing BOT agreements and 
contracts because it is not only BOT that is feasible 
nowadays. We are trying to get other arrangements which 
are existing in other countries, like ROL, Rehabilitate, Operate 
and Lease. There is also ROT, Rehabilitate, Operate 
and Transfer, there is also BOO [expansion unknown], 
etcetera, etcetera, which create new opportunities for investors 
in the Philippines. 
  -- Liberalizing the entry of foreign banks. Finally, a 
composite bill has been forged in committee in the Senate so 
that this proposal is as perfect as human talent can make it, 
according to the committee. And I have certified that composite 
bill. 
  -- Alien legalization act. We must finally resolve the 
status of overstaying aliens in the Philippines. Many of them 
are Chinese, mainly Filipino-Chinese who are still considered 
stateless. Because some of them came out of that 
original group in 1949 when the Chiang Kai Shek forces, the 
Kuomintang fled the mainland, and of course they have children 
and grandchildren already. 
  -- Commission on Higher Education. This is to improve the 
administration of education especially at the higher levels. 
  -- Science and Technology Scholarship Program. Again, 
this is to improve our human development. All of these 
lend impact to our competitiveness for our economic growth. 
  -- Amending Foreign Investments Code, again, to improve 
our attractiveness to investors. 
  -- Resolution on citizenship. This is a different action 
from the Alien Legalization Act because this pertains to 
authorizing the executive branch to set up the procedures, the 
fees, and the other arrangements to facilitate citizenship of 
foreign residents in the Philippines. 
  -- National Health Insurance, dual training system. 
These two are important in the improvement of our 
skills, our health, etc. 
  -- Geothermal energy sources, antipilferage of electricity 
and transmission lines; again, this to improve our energy mix at 
the same time deter criminals from pilfering electricity, 
transmission lines, etc. 
  -- Shelter and Urban Development Financing Act, this is to 
finally package the financial programs for housing, especially 
socialized housing, because right now there are so many agencies 
that are involved. There is no single focus on the priority for 
developing a more aggressive housing program. 
  -- The one called TESDA, Technical Education 
and Skills Development Authority. Again, this is related to 
human development. 
  VAT [value added tax] refinements. This is a 
proposed tax measure, and there are two more bills pertaining to 
population stabilization and next, the set or the family of 
resolutions, ratifications and bills for the implementation of 
GATT agreement resulting from the settlement of the Uruguay 
round, because we are going into a world trade organization set 
up, starting about April 1994. 
  [Phone-in read by Press Secretary Jesus Sison] We have 
a statement from Bacolod, from Raul Gacagculo of Bombo 
Radyo [Big Drum Radio] that says there is a big rally 
going on in public plaza of Bacolod, and this is relayed to you 
for your information and guidance. 
  [Ramos] With our brand of democracy, the people are 
free to demonstrate, to rally. But it is the responsibility of 
our officials on duty to explain to our countrymen, especially 
on the profound and complicated issues such as the oil price 
increase. And maybe, their being together in a rally is a 
good opportunity for our authorities to meet the crowd and 
dialogue with them so that there will be a clearer understanding 
of what is going on. 
  All we ask is let's not make these meetings bloody and 
violent because it will not only hurt our brothers and 
countrymen, especially the children, the women, and the aged, 
but it might also send the wrong signals to our neighboring 
countries, especially at this time when we are receiving a 
favorable impression from these countries especially the 
investors towards the Philippines, especially after our 
breakthrough in 1993. 
  The visit of Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia here 
in the past four days is a very good indication for us and other 
nations on what is really the prevailing condition in our dear 
motherland, the Republic of the Philippines. And so I hope 
that that message to our friends in Bacolod will get through. 
Yes, go ahead and rally as much as you want. But be sure it 
does not become violent or unruly or riotous. And we must also 
observe the rights of the others who are not involved in the 
rally because they must not suffer from this mass action. But 
better yet, give everybody a chance as we have done here in 
Malacanang to dialogue with each other, consult with each other, 
and determine what are really the genuine issues involved. So 
that we can come to a comprehensive and permanent solution of 
the problem. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, the passage and 
implementation of revenue-generating measures normally take 
time. Since the suspension of the oil price increase will only 
be for three weeks, what will happen if the options proposed by 
the joint committee are not implemented before the end of the 
month. Will the oil price increase be implemented? 
  [Ramos] We do not know yet. I don't think we should be 
second-guessing that committee because they're composed of 
bright people. Let's give them a chance to work out something 
for the good of the country. But there are inputs that are 
already available, for instance, the 5 percent reserve on MOOE 
could be diverted immediately to some other needs especially in 
regard to infrastructure development that might be prejudiced 
due to the three-week suspension of the ERB decisions. 
  We are also seeing some hitherto unlisted privatization 
measures. Unlisted because they are not yet been factored in. 
Such as the proposed privatization of government shares of the 
Meralco [Manila Electric Company]. Only this morning, I issued 
the directive to [Finance] Secretary De Ocampo, who is the 
chairman of our committee on privatization, to go ahead with 
that Meralco privatization, but certain parameters and standards 
must be observed because we do not want the government to be 
prejudiced. Those are some of the things that we can use to 
offset. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, are you confident that the 
P10 billion revenues that can be lost from the oil price 
increase can be generated within three weeks? 
  [Ramos] The reported loss is P1.2 billion per month 
from the OPSF, [Oil Price Stabilization Fund] which, 
according to one of the private sectors, that's peanuts. 
But they said at the same time, they will be happy to absorb 
some of the financial impact so that it will not be the poorer 
sectors that will suffer. And so, we welcome that. 
  What will this commitment from the private sector 
translate to in terms of a practical formula? Well, maybe 
we can price gasoline in a socialized way especially for private 
car owners. Probably, we can still increase beyond 
P1.55 because if someone owns a car, the conclusion is, he 
can afford it. Socialized pricing, what shall we 
reduce? Maybe the price of LPG [liquefied petroleum gas]. 
And so, these are some of the solutions being suggested. But, 
obviously we couldn't find all the solutions in the two and a 
half hours that we've met. 
  And so, we threw all the proposals, the bright ideas to this 
committee, and we are giving them three weeks to come up with 
comprehensive, enduring, and just solutions to the basic problem 
which is the deficit, specifically the consolidated public 
sector deficit. [passage omitted] 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, it was pointed out that 
the 18.40 centavo per kilowatt hour of Meralco has nothing to do 
with this recent P1.00 or to P1.55 per liter oil price hike. 
And you mentioned that this Meralco rate hike was intended to 
enable Meralco to expand its facilities. Will this 18.40... 
  [Ramos] I did not say that, somebody here said that. But 
anyway, let's answer this question. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Will this also be rolled back, 
this Meralco rate? 
  [Ramos] Those hearings are not yet finished; there is no 
decision yet as far as I know. But maybe we should just tackle 
that when the problem comes. According to the ERB, and this is 
according to them, there are really three issues that they have 
tried to address because they are all interrelated. The first 
one is the levy. The second is the build-up of the oil price 
stabilization fund which went into deficit by the end of 
December 1993, sooner than their predictions. And the third, is 
the so-called return on rate base or RORB of oil companies. 
  This one about Meralco is to enable them to expand 
so that they can provide better service here in their franchise 
area, and also to pay their bills some of which have become due 
already because if it is not paid and the interest will 
balloon, again this probably is going to be passed on to 
the consumers. But in any case, this is something that is not 
yet finished. We hope that Meralco, just like government, is 
trying to do, can find some alternatives. [passage omitted] 
  [Phone-in question read by Press Secretary Jesus Sison] From 
Michelle Lopez Antonino of Las Pinas, she wants to find out if 
she goes to the gasoline station today, will the price of the 
gasoline before.... 
  [Ramos] The process is like this. Our joint 
committee and this is supported by the president, is now 
communicating with the ERB, presenting these two resolutions to 
the ERB, the Chairman Mr. Tantiongco I suppose will receive 
this. I asked Energy Secretary Lazaro to help in its 
delivery. And it is up to ERB to decide on the resolutions. 
Probably, if they will approve it and they will issue a new 
order to amend the orders that were mentioned in the 
resolution, maybe it will return to the status quo ante. 
But as of now, they still have to act on it. Maybe you 
are looking at another day. [passage omitted]

  [Editorial Report] The following is a roundup of reports on 
Philippine rebel activities from Philippine media monitored by 
Bangkok Bureau between 29 January and 4 February 1994. Source 
information is given in parentheses at the end of each item. 
  29 January-1 February 
  No fileworthy items. 
  2 February 
  Top officers and armed regulars of the Communist Party of 
the Philippines-New People's Army [NPA] in Agusan Province, 
headed by Front Committee Chairman Deo Oncad Maguanta, abandoned 
their camp and surrendered to military authorities. "The 
collapse of the revolutionary movement in the tri-boundary of 
Agusan, Bukidnon, and Misamis is already seen with the coming 
down of Maguanta's first batch of rebels," said a military 
officer. (Manila MANILA BULLETIN p B-12) 
  3 February 
  Sixty-five regulars and political cadres of the Communist 
Party of the Philippines-NPA surrendered on 28 January to take 
advantage of the government's amnesty program in Cauayan, Negros 
Occidental. The rebels all belonged to the Southern Negros 
Command. Each person surrendering was assured of 8,000 
Philippine pesos in government financial assistance. (Manila 
PHILIPPINE DAILY INQUIRER p 21) 
  An NPA political instructor surrendered to military 
authorities in Gumaca, Quezon after denouncing the alleged rift 
over corruption in the communist movement in the province's 
third and fourth districts. He was identified as Renito N. 
Casimiro, alias "Comrade Larry" or "Claro." Casimiro was the 
political instructor and political officer of the Executive 
Committee of the Felimon Cortez Command's Partisan Unit. 
(Manila MANILA BULLETIN p B-6) 
  4 February 
  Three Moro Islamic Liberation Front rebels and one NPA 
rebel died in separate encounters with government troops in 
Cotabato and Zamboanga. Meanwhile, the vice commander of the 
NPA's Romeo Regencia Brigade -- identified as Mariano 
Mamucatcat, alias "Marion Atoy" -- and two top communist rebels 
surrendered to military authorities in Zamboanga del Norte and 
Iligan City. The brigade operates in the mountains of Misamis 
Oriental and Iligan. (Manila MANILA BULLETIN p SB-2) 
  Seven NPA rebels surrendered to military and civilian 
authorities in Ilocos Norte and Agusan del Norte. They also 
turned over five high-power firearms and live bullets. (Manila 
MANILA BULLETIN p 25)

  [Text] Hanoi VNA Feb. 8 -- The Vietnam MIA office yesterday 
handed over to the representatives of the US military Joint Task 
Force on the MIA issue 13 remains of the American servicemen and 
personal effects relating to 26 American militarymen reported 
missing in the Vietnam war. 
  It is the first handover since US President Bill Clinton's 
decision to lift the trade embargo on Vietnam last week. And 
since March 1974, Vietnam has on 46 occasions returned the 
remains of 593 American servicemen to the US side. 
  Of the 13 remains returned yesterday, six were collected by 
the Vietnam-US joint search teams during the 27th joint search 
operation for MIAs and seven handed over by the local people. 
  The US side appreciated the humanitarian policy and 
cooperation of the Vietnamese Government and people in settling 
the MIA issue.

  [Text] Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam, on his 
way home after visiting a number of East Asian countries, made a 
stopover in Moscow from 5 to 7 Febraury. 
  During his stay in Moscow, the Vietnamese foreign minister 
held a working session with Russian Deputy Premier Yarov, 
chairman of the Russia-Vietnam Governmental Commission for 
Economic and Scientific-Technological Cooperation, and Russian 
Foreign Minister Kozyrev. 
  Minister Nguyen Manh Cam and Russian Deputy Premier Yarov 
noted great efforts by both sides in carrying out tasks during 
the past period. Both sides agreed that more efforts should be 
made to accelerate and expand cooperation for mutual interest, 
especially in the areas of energy and the processing of such 
tropical agricultural products as tea, rubber, coffee, coconut 
oil, and fruits. Efforts should also be made to develop light 
industry, expand cooperation between Vietnamese provinces and 
Russia's Eastern Region, and strengthen direct relations between 
business establishments of the two countries. Both sides 
emphasized the necessity to exchange views on strengthening the 
bilateral economic, trade, and scientific-technological 
relations in the days ahead. 
  In his meeting with the Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev, 
the 
two ministers noted positive progress in bilateral relations 
during the past period. They agreed that greater efforts should 
be made to enhance the relations of friendship and 
multicooperation between the two countries.

  [Excerpt] Former Prime Minister Anan Panyarachun has 
described his recent visit to Vietnam as "very successful" as he 
was given opportunities to see his old friends and his 
companions were encouraged to do business in Vietnam. 
  "We had a very good two-day visit here because we were given 
opportunities to call on Premier Vo Van Kiet and Party 
Secretary-General Do Muoi and the delegates, after talking with 
other Vietnamese high ranking officials, were now able to attain 
Vietnam's policies and govemment leaders' views so that they 
could plan their future investment in Vietnam," said Anan in an 
interview with THE NATION before leaving Hanoi Friday for Ho Chi 
Minh City, the second leg of his working visit to Vietnam. 
  Anan led a delegation comprising 20 top Thai businessmen on 
a 
five-day working visit to Vietnam at the invitation of 
Vietnamese Premier Vo Van Kiet. The visit was described by both 
the hosts and the guest as "a returning home." "For the 
Vietnamese, you have been our friend for years. You have been 
making every effort to establish good Thai-Vietnamese ties. 
Therefore in our view, your trip to Vietnam this time could be 
seen as a returning home," said Dau Ngoc Xuan, chairman of the 
State Committee for Cooperation and Investment at a reception 
given shortly afer Anan's arrival. 
  The respect given to Anan by the Vietnamese even sounds 
better when Vietnamese Premier praised his guest as Vietnam's 
good and trusted friend. "Your visit will surely usher in a new 
era, that of a multi-faceted cooperation between our two 
countries," Kiet said at a reception given to Anan last 
Wednesday [2 February]. "We should join our efforts on 
accelerating the Thai-Vietnamese ties regardless of whatever the 
past was," Kiet added. 
  In turn, Anan said he shared the Vietnamese leaders' views. 
"I'll do everything I can to accelerate and cement 
Thai-Vietnamese ties," he added. Anan also said during his long 
talks with Kiet at a small private dinner given in his honour by 
the Vietnamese premier, the host and the guest had talked quite 
a bit about political and economic ties between Vietnam and 
Thailand. 
  "We all expressed our satisfaction at the development of the 
ties between our two countries," said Anan, adding that he was 
quite satisfied with his trip. 
  Asked if there was any contact signed during the trip, the 
former premier said three memorandums of understanding would be 
signed in Ho Chi Minh city. According to them, a zippers and 
buttons factory would be set up by Saha Union and there would be 
technical cooperation between Pranda Jewellery (of Thailand) and 
Saigon Jewellery. 
  Asked to comment on the decision recently taken by the 
United 
States to lift the trade embargo against Vietnam the former 
premier said,"it's good for the United States. It's good for 
Vietnam. It's good for the region. The move helps everybody put 
the Vietnam War behind them. We all look forward to expanding 
ties between the countries, between the United States and 
Vietnam," he said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Hanoi, Feb 7 (AFP) -- Foreign business people who 
fail to produce a tax clearance form upon leaving Vietnam will 
be barred from returning, under a plan being worked out jointly 
by taxation and immigration authorities. General Department of 
Taxation (GDT) officials told the weekly Vietnam Investment 
Review (VIR) that they were planning to introduce the procedure 
to halt income-tax dodging by expatriates. 
  "Currently, there's no coordination at all and many foreign 
businessmen slip through without any tax payment," the GDT's 
Truong Chi Trung was quoted as saying. He did not say when the 
plan would be put in place. Trung said GDT would also like to 
work with banks operating in Vietnam to achieve tighter control 
over the repatriation of profits overseas. "So far, we have no 
idea who sends what," he told VIR. 
  Trung said loopholes in tax-collection procedures were 
costing Vietnam massive revenue losses. Foreign-invested 
enterprises nonetheless paid 5.5 trillion dong (511 million 
dollars) in taxes last year, nearly twice as much as in 1992.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA Feb. 8-- More than 100 overseas Vietnamese 
returning from 15 countries for Tet, the lunar new year festival 
falling on Feb. 9, met here on Thursday in the presence of Vice 
President Nguyen Thi Binh. Speaking at the function, Mr Nguyen 
Ngoc Tran, chairman of the Central Board for Overseas Vietnamese 
said that about 180,000 Vietnamese overseas had returned to the 
homeland for Tet and for investment opportunities in 1993, 
compared to little more than 100,000 for the Tet of last year. 
  He said that their activities to contribute to national 
renovation have become more and more practical and fruitful. By 
the end of 1993, overseas Vietnamese had 30 projects licensed by 
the Vietnamese Government capitalized at tens of millions of US 
dollars. They mostly deal with electronics, chemicals, tourism, 
services, agriculture, forestry, fishery and soft drinks. 
  They also have contributed to the transfer of modern 
technology to the country in several fields. Many consultative 
ideas from overseas Vietnamese have been considered valuable by 
government offices in the fields of education and training, 
science and technology, finance, banking tourism and 
administration. 
  After Tet, a number of overseas Vietnamese experts will 
return to the homeland to attend a conference on Vietnam's 
university education renovation with their colleagues here. 
  According to Mr Tran, more than 2 million Vietnamese have 
settled in 70 countries. There are about 1 million in the 
United States, 200,000 in France, 150,000 in Canada, 130,000 in 
Australia and 85,000 in Germany. Around 400,000 of them have got 
university or post graduate degrees and some are holding key 
positions in many branches of sciences, technology and 
management. 
  Overseas Vietnamese remittance to their families constitutes 
an important source of foreign exchange. 
  Total import-export turnover of companies owned by overseas 
Vietnamese is estimated at around USD 4-6 million a year. 
  In order to broaden the overseas Vietnamaese participation 
in 
economic and technical development programmes in the country, 
the government is preparing to establish an overseas Vietnamese 
bank, a centre of training and technology transfer staffed by 
overseas Vietnamese and also so form of non-governmental 
consultancy mechanism of overseas Vietnamese.

  [Text] In today's issue, NHAN DAN carries an editorial 
marking the party's 64th founding anniversary. The editorial 
reads in part as follows: 
  The international situation has developed quickly and 
complicatedly since the seventh party congress. Our country is 
making efforts to overcome difficulties and move forward. There 
still remain many weaknesses and shortcomings. Nonetheless, 
under the party's leadership, we have overcome to a very 
important extent the socioeconomic crisis, continued to maintain 
and consolidate political stability, and broadened diplomatic 
relations. Those particularly important achievements have 
created the preliminary conditions for our country to gradually 
shift to a new state of development to serve the goals of 
national industrialization and modernization. 
  Realities over the past years testify to the correctness of 
the party's major renovation policies and to the appropriateness 
of its actions. The resolutions of the sixth and seventh party 
congresses have been applied in a practical fashion.

  [Excerpts] The U.S. trade sanctions imposed on the SRV for 
19 years have finally been lifted by the U.S. Government of 
President Bill Clinton. Although the war in Vietnam was over in 
1975, the American people continued to feel the pain of the 
defeat of the U.S.-backed South Vietnam. [passage omitted] 
  The main purpose of this policy change is not for trade with 
Vietnam, but to search for missing American soldiers, dead or 
alive. President Clinton wanted the opening up of trade with 
Vietnam to achieve, in return, a greater cooperation from the 
Vietnamese Government in finding the MIA's. It has been long 
anticipated that the U.S. trade embargo on Vietnam, a measure 
which runs against the principle of free trade upheld by the 
United States, would finally be lifted by the U.S. 
Administration under President Bill Clinton who was an opponent 
of the Vietnam war as a student. [passage omitted] 
  On the whole, the U.S. lifting of the trade embargo on 
Vietnam should contribute to economic growth in Southeast Asia. 
Foreign investment in Vietnam will boost Vietnam's economy and 
the Vietnamese people's purchasing power. This will enhance 
Vietnam's economic potential making it a new competitor in this 
region. This trend will serve as an economic impetus for the 
entire region, including Thailand itself which, from now on, 
will have to make greater efforts in economic development if it 
still dreams of becoming an economic leader in the region.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The U.S. Stand on the Liberalization of Banking </F>
Business"] 
  [Excerpts] The current of globalization now creeping into 
the livelihood of the Thai people and society is expected to 
bring about several abrupt changes in many areas. Without well 
planned and effective precautions, national development will be 
obstructed and delayed while businesses and trade with foreign 
countries will be adversely affected. 
  Based on our observation, changes in three areas will take 
place in the near future. They are: First, the launching of 
the "Thaicom" satellite which, as everyone knows, will greatly 
benefit Thai society. Second, the introduction of an fiber 
optic cable into telephone service which will be tremendously 
beneficial to telecommunication facilities. Third, the 
promulgation of the new international investment and trade 
regulations under the "GATT" agreement in which Thailand is also 
a signatory. 
  Under the "GATT" agreement, the structure and system of 
trade 
and investment will have to be significantly readjusted. It is 
imperative that the government clearly explain as well as give 
sufficient knowledge to the people so as to enable them to be 
fully prepared in advance to cope with possible impacts. 
Educational institutions should also disseminate necessary 
information and knowledge to their students because we will 
certainly be unable to avoid the consequences. 
  Also under the "GATT" agreement, the United States will play 
a role in trade and investment in this country. Aside from 
telecommunications, the United States is likely to get more 
involved in other businesses. The United States particularly 
has been pressing for the liberalization of banking business in 
this country. 
  Two events which took place in the past week gave us some 
hint about the U.S. stand in this connection. On 5 February, 
David Lambertson, U.S. ambassador to Thailand, and Colonel 
Chinnawut Sunthonsima, minister attached to the Prime Minister's 
Office, jointly opened the "Development Partnership" program 
under which the United States has agreed to provide 225 million 
baht for environmental development and AIDS prevention. [passage 
omitted] Another event is the 3 February announcement on the 
lifting of the U.S. trade embargo against Vietnam. [passage 
omitted] 
  The two cited events indicate the U.S. role and expectations 
in Thailand and the Indochinese region. Naturally, the United 
States intends profit more here. 
  However, if it is true that the United States is pressing 
for 
the liberalization of banking business to allow its commercial 
banks to operate in this country, the government must treat this 
matter as important as other major issues such as relations 
between the two countries. The government must work out 
necessary measures to cope with the situation as a result of the 
enforcement of the new "GATT" regulations.

  [Text] Lao Foreign Minister Somsavat Lengsavat, who is on a 
two-day visit to Thailand, called on Foreign Minister Squadron 
Leader Prasong Sunsiri at the Foreign Ministry today at 1430. 
After consultations, the two ministers signed an agreement on 
the exemption of visas for diplomatic passports. 
  The Thai and Lao ministers held a news briefing after their 
meeting. They reported on the progress of their discussion 
about the ownership of the Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge. Progress 
was achieved at today's discussion, which was marked by a mutual 
understanding. There are only technical problems involving laws 
left to be settled. The two ministers believed that a final 
agreement could be achieved soon. 
  The two also discussed a Lao proposal to open a consulate in 
Thailand to which Thailand agreed in principle. The site of the 
consulate has not been fixed, but Nong Khai Province was 
mentioned as most appropriate. 
  After the briefing, Foreign Minister Prasong was scheduled 
to 
accompany Lao Foreign Minister Somsavat Lengsavat for an 
audience with His Majesty the King at Chitlada Palace.

  [Excerpts] Thailand and Laos have resolved a dispute over 
the ownership of the Mittraparb (Friendship) Bridge by agreeing 
to divide it at mid-point, informed sources said yesterday. An 
agreement on ownership is expected to be signed today by Foreign 
Minister Prasong Sunsiri and his Laotian counterpart Somsavat 
Lengsavat when they meet at the Foreign Ministry in Bangkok, the 
sources said. The agreement will set aside the boundary question 
and enable technical officials to continue negotiations on the 
administration and maintenance of the bridge. 
  Director General of the Department of Energy Affairs Dr 
Prathet Sutabut is to lead a Thai delegation to Vientiane soon 
to discuss administration and maintenance of the bridge. 
  Thai officials said any agreement reached by the delegation 
would be an "interim measure" to, facilitate the administration 
and maintenance of the bridge and to divide jurisdiction. But 
it will have no bearing on the boundary line between the two 
countries along the Mekong river. The agreement will state that 
both sides will continue to regard the river's deepest point 
beneath the bridge as the natural boundary line, the officials 
said. [passage omitted] 
  Technically, under the Thai proposal, the ownership line 
would move closer to the Laotian side of the bridge in 
concurrence with the international borderline along the Mekong 
River. But the proposal from Vientiane would require a change 
to the Thai constitution. 
  According to Thai estimates, about 1,000 vehicles will use 
the bridge daily when it is opened. Prathet said in a recent 
interview that under a tentative agreement, a BtlO toll will 
apply to four-wheeled vehicles and about Bt50 will be levied on 
coaches and trucks. At this stage, the fee will be collected 
only one-way. Thailand-bound and Laos-bound vehicles will pay 
an entry fee at the entry point and will not be charged at the 
exit point, Prathet said. The bridge will be opened between 8 
am and 6 pm. 
  However further discussions will be needed to conclude all 
the details, he said.

  [Excerpts] A feasibility study will be made on a Thai 
proposal for two bridges to be built linking Narathiwat's Takbai 
and Waeng districts with Kelantan's Bunkit Bunga and Pengkalan 
Kubor. [passage omitted] 
  Malaysia yesterday agreed ta have the Thai-Malaysia Border 
Socio Economic Development Committee conduct the study. 
Malaysian Defence Minister Dato Seri Mohammad Najib bin Tun Hayi 
Abdul Razak said after yesterday's committee meeting in Bangkok 
that the committee would be responsible for the study. [passage 
omitted] 
  A senior Thai military officer said: "Malaysia has not 
accepted our proposal, but it has positively responded to it. 
It might be a time before a conclusion can be reached on the 
topic." The Thais led by Defence Minister Gen Wichit Sukmak also 
urged Malaysia to add more ferries to the existing ferry service 
at Takbai-Pengkalan Kubor. Both Dato Deri Mohammad Abdul Razak 
and Gen Wichit hailed the success of the meeting at which both 
sides reviewed the committee's performance and assigned new 
tasks. 
  Gen Wichit said both countries agreed to set a time frame, 
likely to be mid-1994, to review some topics which should be 
amended to cope with the changing situation because a threat 
from the communists (Communist Party of Malaya) had been 
eliminated. 
  Fourth Army Commander Lt-Gen Kitti Rattanachaya, who also 
chairs the Thai-Malaysia Regional Border Committee, said 
Malaysia had stressed several times that it would not allow 
terrorists to use its territory as a base to cause trouble. 
During a meeting chaired by supreme commanders from both sides 
last October, Malaysia turned down a Thai proposal to class 
"separatist movements" as both countries' common enemy, under a 
border treaty. 
  However, during that meeting, Malaysia said it would provide 
full cooperation with Thailand to resolve the problem and it 
would not allow separatists to take refuge in Malaysia. 
  "By the middle of this year a second high-level meeting will 
be held in Malaysia and then we will know the scope of the 
treaty amendment. 
  "Any amendment will benefit the two countries," said Maj-Gen 
Pricha Rungsawan, commander of the General Border Committee's 
Office.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 7 (YONHAP) -- North Korea does not 
want war breaking out again on the Korean peninsula, a senior 
official at the North Korean mission to the United Nations said 
Monday. But if war is unavoidable, North Korea will not be 
another Iraq, which suffered an ignominious defeat in the Gulf 
war, the official declared in an exclusive interview with YONHAP 
news agency. 
  North Korea has been patiently awaiting a resolution of the 
nuclear issue, but "since our existence depends on it, we will 
resolutely face the problem, unafraid," the official said on 
condition of anonymity. 
  Obviously aware of a move by the United States to refer the 
nuclear issue to the U.N. Security Council for economic 
sanctions, the official said North Korea "has managed to go on 
living without help from the United States, Japan and Russia." 
  "They all have to know that even a worm, if stepped on, 
wriggles," he said, by way of warning that North Korea would not 
submit meekly to military provocation. 
  The official, however, made no negative comments on China, 
backing up past speculation that Pyongyang has been in close 
consultation with Beijing on the nuclear issue. 
  Asked about the possibility of contact between the United 
States and North Korea prior to the International Atomic Energy 
Agency's Board of Governors' meeting Feb. 21, he said he knew 
nothing about it.

<F P=106> [Article by Kim Chun-pom] </F>
  [Text] It has been learned that North Korea has succeeded 
in developing the Nodong-1 and Nodong-2 missiles, which have a 
firing range of more than 1,000 km, and that it has recently 
assembly-line produced Russian ultramodern MiG-29 jets. Thus, 
attention is focused on the ROK's counter strategy and on the 
balance of North- South forces. 
  Remarkable progress in U.S.-North Korean negotiations over 
nuclear issues has not been made and the United States is 
reviewing sanctions against North Korea. This causes the people 
to worry that a war may break out once again on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  It is clear that if a war breaks out on the Korean 
peninsula, 
the first offensive and defensive battle between the North and 
the South will be a air battle [kongjungjon]. 
  Comparison of the North and South Air Force reveals that the 
South has 520 tactical planes [chonsulgi] and the North has 850 
tactical planes; the South has 190 support planes [chiwongi] and 
the North has 480 support planes; and the South has 600 
helicopters and the North has 290 helicopters. Thus, North 
Korea has approximately 320 [number as published] more planes 
than South Korea. 
  The ROK plans to introduce and produce F-16 jets. It has 
been learned that North Korea has decided to introduce or 
produce 100 MiG-29's from Russia and that it has already 
introduced 14 MiG-29 jets. 
  It is estimated the F-16 jets and MiG-29 jets rate the same 
in performance standards -- mobility, weapons-loading capacity, 
and radius of action. 
  The superiority of the F-16 and MiG-29 jets will be 
determined by the ultramodern electronic equipment loaded in 
both jets and by the ability of its pilots. 
  Both the South and the North are competing to introduce 
ultramodern fighters. Regarding the comparative strength of the 
North and South Air Force at the Military Demarcation Line, 
North Korea will, for the time being, maintain its superiority 
over South Korea. 
  It is true the ROK is numerically inferior to North Korea 
when considering the fighting power of North and South. 
  Regardless of the quantitative comparison, the U.S. Air 
Force 
has pride in the strength of its air supremacy in the ROK. 
Comparison of the index number [chollyok chisu] of fighting 
power -- one rifle equals one index number -- reveals the ROK's 
index number is 4.5, thus being superior to that of North Korea 
by approximately 1.5. 
  Of course, the figures do not reflect intangible fighting 
power, such as pilots' ability and morale. The ability of ROK 
pilots has been estimated as greatly superior to that of North 
Korean pilots. 
  Regarding the level of training and ability of South and 
North Korean pilots, average flying hours of an Air Force 
lieutenant colonel of South Korea is approximately 2,500 hours, 
that of a North Korean is approximately one-third that amount. 
  Therefore, our Air Force has the confidence that "it will be 
a competent match" in the event of an air war between the South 
and North. 
  North Korea possesses more than 470 aircraft, including the 
Russian-made fighter MiG-19/21 and SU-7/25, as its mainstay 
aircraft. The ROK has the F-4/E as its mainstay aircraft and 
the existing air firepower will be reinforced with F-16's at the 
end of this year. It is difficult to discriminate between the 
fighting power of North Korea's MiG and ROK's Chekong because 
they are almost the same. 
  It has been learned that in the event a war breaks out on 
the 
Korean peninsula, the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces will apply the 
following five-step scenario according to the existing combined 
defense strategy of "Operational Plan 5027:" 
  One, (Pre-war), the U.S. Rapid Deployment Forces will be 
deployed to the Korean peninsula to deter a war; if a war breaks 
out; 
  Two (Rejection), the southward invasion will be blocked 
along the current front and strategic facilities at North 
Korea's rear will be destroyed; 
  Three (Annihilation), major North Korean combat 
capabilities will be annihilated and large-scale landing 
operations will be conducted while breaking through battle lines 
to advance northward; 
  Four (Isolation), Pyongyang will be isolated and occupied 
areas in North Korea will be placed under military rule; 
  Five (Post-war), the reunification of the Korean peninsula 
will be achieved with the ROK's initiative.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 8 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu has pushed forward his plans to visit the United States 
for decisive talks on the North Korean nuclear problem that will 
determine whether Seoul and Washington choose a diplomatic 
solution or U.N. sanctions, ministry officials said Tuesday. 
Han leaves on Wednesday instead of Sunday, bound for the U.S. 
capital first instead of Canada for critical consultations with 
U.S. leaders before heading to Canada and Mexico. 
  Part of the trip's purpose is to strengthen economic 
relations with all three parties of the North American Free 
Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and to tap South Korea's market entry 
possibilities. 
  At the same time, the trip precedes the Feb. 21 "deadline" 
when the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of 
Governors meets to discuss North Korea's non-compliance with 
nuclear inspections. 
  Ministry officials said Han will raise the issue of the 
current tone of U.S. press reports accenting inter-Korean 
tension and the possibility of a clash. He plans to request 
prudence on Washington's part so that reports are not premature 
on policies yet to be adopted or issues under sensitive 
negotiation. 
  The American press has been playing up what it sees as 
growing calls for punitive action against North Korea for 
refusing nuclear inspections, such as U.N. economic sanctions. 
  Seoul remains concerned that any rash action against the 
closed Stalinist state might provoke a violent clash between the 
two Koreas, which have already experienced the fratricidal war 
of 1950-53. 
  The foreign minister will be in Washington from Feb. 9-13 
and plans to meet Secretary of State Warren Christopher, 
National Security Adviser Anthony Lake and new Defense Secretary 
William Perry, among others. 
  The foreign minister is expected to stop over at the United 
Nations to discuss sanctions against North Korea with Secretary- 
general Butrus Butrus-Ghali. 
  While in Canada Feb. 13-16, Han will meet with Prime 
Minister Jean Chretien. 
  In Mexico, he is to meet President Carlos Salinas and hold 
foreign ministers' talks with Manuel Tello Macias during his 
Feb. 16-19 stay.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 8 (YONHAP) -- Seoul hasn't given up on 
diplomatic dialogue to solve North Korean nuclear issue, Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu said Tuesday, adding that North Korea and 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) had significantly 
narrowed their gap before the breakup in negotiations. He 
watered down U.S. press reports and analyses of escalating 
tension on the Korean peninsula, disclaiming them as coming from 
outside the Washington government. 
  "The South Korean and U.S. Governments hope to solve the 
problem through dialogue as much as possible," Han said in a 
press conference on the eve of departure to Washington. 
  "We cannot but seek other measures if this (dialogue) fails. 
This has been our stance and still is," he said. 
  Han did not believe North Korea was trying to get more 
carrots from the United States in exchange for accepting IAEA 
nuclear inspections. 
  The North Korea-IAEA standoff probably has more to do with 
the change of mood at the negotiation table, Han analyzed. 
  "It's not true that there was no progress in North 
Korea-IAEA 
talks. The two sides had significantly narrowed their gap," Han 
told reporters. 
  The South Korean foreign minister will be in the U.S. 
capital Wednesday to Saturday, roughly 10 days before the Feb. 
21 "deadline" when the IAEA Board of Governors is certain to 
discuss North Korea's non-compliance with the Agency's 
inspection demands. 
  The Washington visit is tied with his trip to Canada and 
Mexico, the two other parties to North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA). 
  Han is set to meet Secretary of State Warren Christopher, 
National Security Advisor Anthony Lake and Defense Secretary 
William Perry. 
  "We will be reconfirming the basic principles, direction and 
methods, exchanging evaluation and analyses on recent 
developments on North Korean nuclear issue," said Han. 
  "Depending on how the matter proceeds, we will talk about 
cooperation with the United Nations and other involved nations 
such as China and Japan." 
  Whether diplomatic efforts end with North Korea rests with 
the IAEA, according to the foreign minister, who must decide 
when its safeguards activities on North Korea have ceased. 
  The end of safeguards activities means the IAEA can no 
longer 
guarantee that North Korea is not diverting its nuclear 
materials and facilities to military use, he said. 
  "Such declaration is entirely up to the IAEA. We will 
respect the IAEA decision and comply by it," said Han, "We will 
also respect, participate and cooperate with any decision the 
U.N. Security Council makes on the issue."

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 8 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu embarks on a visit Wednesday that is 
probably the most pressure-filled and heavily-tasked since he 
took office a year ago. 
  The weight of the North Korean nuclear problem was felt 
again 
in recent weeks as the escalating tension prompted the Foreign 
Ministry to hastily announce that Han is pushing up his Canada, 
U.S. and Mexico tour schedule. Instead of leaving on Sunday 
for Canada, he takes off on Wednesday first for Washington for a 
two-day visit. 
  The announcement came amid a spreading mood of resignation 
here that patience has hit the wall in trying to talk out the 
nuclear problem with North Korea. 
  Han will likely discuss sanctions against North Korea in his 
talks with U.N. Secretary-general Butrus Butrus-Ghali and top 
U.S. policy-makers. 
  Seoul first proposed the itinerary change to squeeze in the 
two extra days. 
  "Day-to-day developments are critical at the moment," said 
Chang Chai-ryong, director-general of American affairs, in 
explaining the reason for the change. 
  The trip takes Han to meetings with the White House national 
security team including top Advisor Anthony Lake, foreign 
policy-makers including Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
and military officials such as Defense Secretary William Perry. 
  The talks fall at a delicate time. When Han was planning the 
Washington trip last month, he was thinking about how the two 
countries should prepare for the next round of high-level North 
Korea-U.S. talks that would have dealt with symbolic 
improvement of relations. 
  Instead, North Korea is now threatening to break off 
negotiations with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
on nuclear inspections. American Congressmen are calling for 
action, not dialogue, to resolve the problem. Press reports 
focus on possible military scenarios in case of war on the 
Korean peninsula. 
  Han will be in or near the United States as the nuclear 
problem reaches the Feb. 21 "deadline," the day the IAEA Board 
of Governors opens its meeting. 
  This week's Washington visit is a dip in the water, 
discussing various scenarios from sanctions to a shift whenever 
necessary. But Han, while talking about sanctions, will still 
pin his hopes on a last-minute backdown by Pyongyang and urge 
diplomatic dialogue to that end. 
  Seoul, after all, is the last party wishing to see a clash 
with Pyongyang. 
  The following week is when the two countries take the 
plunge, 
having to decide whether to really impose sanctions. Once the 
IAEA decides that its nuclear safeguards activities in North 
Korea are irreparably compromised, the Security Council will 
take over and naturally move on to U.N. sanctions. 
  The time in between will be spent on mustering the support 
of 
China, the North's staunchest ally, and Japan whose severance of 
secretive money flowing into Pyongyang is critical in case of 
economic sanctions. 
  Han's decision to spend more time with U.S. officials 
reflects Seoul's feeling that it's time to establish concrete 
plans. South Korea and the United States will have to determine 
when to turn these plans into action.

  [Text] It has been learned that the government is 
considering ways of applying sanctions on North Korea over the 
nuclear issue, such as economic sanctions by the UN Security 
Council, in preparation for the worst situation, in case North 
Korea does not allow nuclear inspections by the International 
Atomic Energy Agency. 
  Considering the international cooperation system to be the 
most important one in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue, 
the government has decided to send Nuclear Ambassador Kim 
Sam-hun and other government officials to countries concerned, 
such as the United States, Japan, China, and Austria.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Yi Sok-ku from Tokyo] </F>
  [Text] Quoting a ROK Defense Ministry source, Japan's 
YOMIURI SHIMBUN reported on 8 February that the ROK and the 
United States have decided to begin the Team Spirit joint 
military exercise on 22 March, which will last 10 days, if North 
Korea does not accept nuclear inspections by 21 February when 
the International Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governor's 
meeting is to be held. 
  YOMIURI SHIMBUN reported that this year's Team Spirit 
exercise will be sharply reduced in its scope compared to last 
year, but that it will be faced with a more tense situation due 
to North Korea's nuclear issue. 
  YOMIURI SHIMBUN reported that the ROK and the United States 
decided that 40,000 troops -- one-third of last year's 120,000 
troops that were fully mobilized for the exercise -- will take 
part in this year's exercise. It also reported that the two 
countries are examining the possibility of not deploying combat 
forces from the U.S. continent, but holding the exercise with 
the U.S. troops stationed in the ROK and the ROK Armed Forces. 
  However, THE WASHINGTON POST reported that the U.S. Defense 
Department is preparing for the possible order to deploy to the 
ROK approximately 1,000 U.S. soldiers on active duty and reserve 
forces by 22 February for the possible holding of the Team 
Spirit exercise. 
  YOMIURI SHIMBUN added that the ROK and the United States 
decided that they will stop the exercise if North Korea 
expresses its will to accept nuclear inspections even if the 
Team Spirit exercise has begun.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
articles and editorials from ROK vernacular newspapers published 
on 8 February on the U.S. order to prepare for the Team Spirit 
military exercise and the DPRK nuclear issue. 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO in Korean publishes on page 2 a 
900-word article by Washington-based correspondent Chong 
Chin-sok analyzing the background of the order to prepare for 
the Team Spirit exercise. The article interprets the order to 
prepare for the Team Spirit exercise as a realization that "the 
negotiations on the North Korean nuclear issue have actually 
ruptured" and explains that the order serves as an ultimatum to 
North Korea. 
  The article reports "the United States is most concerned 
about the possibility that North Korea may declare itself a 
nuclear possessing country because this would automatically 
exempt North Korea from the obligation to accept nuclear 
inspections, and as a result, sanctions by the UN Security 
Council would not be as easy." 
  The article quotes Dr. (Spector) of the Carnegie Endowment 
for International Peace: "There is no clue that could prove 
North Korea is a nonnuclear country." 
  The article forecasts that the U.S. Government will look to 
"a final settlement at the edge of the cliff" by not announcing 
the detailed schedule of the Team Spirit exercise for the time 
being. 
  The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 an 
800- word editorial criticizing the use of the Team Spirit 
exercise as a negotiating card. The editorial asserts that the 
"purely defensive" Team Spirit exercise is "inevitable" and 
"natural" under the current defense system of the ROK-U.S. 
Combined Forces and that it was not appropriate to use the 
exercise in the negotiations in the first place. 
  The editorial asserts that if the exercise had not been used 
as a negotiating card so easily, we might not have been blamed 
for evoking the tension first by resuming the preparations for 
the joint military exercise after saying it was possible to 
suspend the exercise. The editorial also points out that there 
is no guarantee North Korea will abandon nuclear development 
even if all its conditions are met because in the past North 
Korea has always added new conditions after concessions have 
been made. 
  The editorial continues that in dealing with such a 
sensitive 
issue, it should be made clear what concessions we are able to 
make, and the advantages and disadvantages of giving up or 
insisting on nuclear development. 
  The editorial reports that while continuing dialogue 
efforts, 
we should make full preparations for the people's safety and the 
right of existence and urge the government to show, thorough its 
security posture, its clear position toward the North Korean 
nuclear issue. 
  The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 a 
1,000-word article by Washington-based correspondent Chin 
Chang-uk. 
  The article notes that even though the hard-line moves of 
the 
United States -- including U.S. Defense Secretary Perry's 
remarks regarding the use of sticks after carrots, the 
resumption of the Team Spirit exercise, deployment of Patriot 
missiles and Apache helicopters, and disclosure of the five-step 
operation plan -- may lead to a crisis scenario, analysts of 
Korean affairs in Washington are optimistic. 
  The article reports that the analysts assert that North 
Korea 
will eventually accept all the inspection conditions of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency and that North Korea is 
dreaming if it thinks a war is inevitable under its current 
military preparedness. The article reports that the analysts 
think North Korea is not at all prepared for a large-scale war 
based on the fact that "there is a serious food shortage in 
North Korea, there has been no signs that it has made any 
efforts to secure more military provisions, and that North Korea 
has only a two-month energy reserve with its existing energy 
storage facilities." 
  The article cites another assertion that because North Korea 
is more afraid of the counterattack by ROK-U.S. Combined Forces, 
war will not breakout on the Korean peninsula as long as North 
Korea does not lose its reason. The article concludes with 
concern by pessimistic analysts about the possibility that the 
United States might lose its reason after the humiliating 
results of the negotiations with North Korea.

<F P=106> [Article by Kyong Yong-won: "`ROK-U.S. Joint Operations </F>
Plan' Set Up in 1992"] 
  [Text] It has been disclosed that the ROK and the United 
States, in their joint operations plan worked out in 1992 in 
preparation for a North Korean southward invasion, introduced 
the new concept of active defense aimed at destroying the North 
Korean regime and reunifying the country under the ROK 
initiative instead of the old concept of negative defensive 
operations. The disclosure of this plan draws our attention. 
  The relevant officials of the Ministry of National Defense 
[MND] say that this change was not made abruptly at that time 
but because the ROK and the United States felt the shortcomings 
of the negative operational concept in the sixties and seventies 
for the North Korean southward invasion, they gradually 
introduced the offensive operational concept of air-raid on and 
advance to the North Korean rear areas. The MND officials say 
that this has nothing to do with the present North Korean 
nuclear issue. 
  Until the mid-seventies, the ROK and the United States had a 
negative operational concept against the North Korean southward 
invasion of abandoning Seoul, if unavoidable, and retreating to 
the area south of Seoul, and, taking step-by-step counter-attack 
actions when the U.S. reinforcement arrives and repelling the 
enemy to the area north of the truce line. 
  The ROK side strongly suggested to the U.S. side on several 
occasions that Seoul not be abandoned. Accordingly, the 
operations plan changed in the mid-seventies to the effect that 
the North Korean advance should be checked in the area north of 
Seoul. 
  In the early eighties, the old concept came under criticism 
calling for stronger punishment for war provokers, and the 
ROK-U.S. operations plan took on a more offensive nature 
incorporating the U.S. Air-Land Battle [as published] concept. 
The concept was that if North Korea wages a preemptive attack, 
the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces would attack major facilities in 
the North Korean area with Air Force planes and special forces. 
As soon as large-scale reinforcement forces arrive from the 
U.S. mainland, the ROK-U.S. forces would make offensive 
operations, landing large-scale landing forces in the North 
Korean rear areas, thus dealing North Korea a serious blow. 
  This strategy was developed from the mid-eighties to the 
early nineties, but the ROK and the United States could not 
establish a precise target as to what extent we should strike 
North Korea. 
  The issue of "target" began to be discussed in 1990 when 
General RisCassi assumed the post of commander of the ROK-U.S. 
Combined Forces and began a fundamental review of the ROK-U.S. 
operations plan. In the discussion of this subject, the ROK and 
the United States differed in their views at one time. 
  The ROK and the United States finally agreed in 1992 that 
they would occupy or isolate Pyongyang, decide on advancement 
north of Pyongyang in stages according to the situation, and 
proceed to attack North Korea just enough to demolish its regime 
and for the ROK to gain the initiative in reunification. 
  According to this "new operational plan 5027," the ROK and 
the United States have established a 5-step scenario against 
possible southward invasion by North Korea. 
  First, they will prevent war by deploying U.S. rapid 
deployment deterrent forces (FDO) [expansion unknown] on the 
Korean peninsula. 
  Second, if a war takes place, they will deter North 
Korea's southward invasion north of Seoul and destroy strategic 
facilities at North Korea's rear. 
  Third, they will annihilate North Korea's major combat 
capabilities and conduct large-scale landing operations while 
breaking through battle lines to advance northward. 
  Fourth, they will isolate Pyongyang and place occupied 
areas of North Korea under their military rule. 
  Fifth, they will achieve reunification of the Korean 
peninsula upon the ROK's initiative. 
  Military officials say that these changes in the ROK-U.S. 
joint operations plan, both in name and reality, enables 
preparedness against a possible North Korean southward invasion, 
and if necessary, guarantees the destruction of the North Korean 
regime and reunification according to the ROK's initiative. 
  The details of the changes which have only now been 
disclosed, are reported by the U.S. media as though a U.S. idea 
being realized based on its current hard line policy on the 
North Korean nuclear issue. The Defense Ministry officials 
regard the U.S. media's recent reports on this and policies to 
reinforce the ROK-based U.S. Forces, such as the deployment of 
Patriot missiles and Apache helicopters, as a series of U.S. 
moves aimed at creating tension on the Korean peninsula, and 
they are keeping careful watch over the behavior of the U.S. 
Government and media.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
articles published in Seoul vernacular daily newspapers on 7 and 
8 February in connection with the revision in U.S. strategy for 
defending the ROK that was reported by THE NEW YORK TIMES on 6 
February. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO on 7 February carries on page 
1, 
a 300-word report by reporter Kim Sung-yong from New York on a 
new U.S. strategy for defending the ROK. 
  Under the headlines, "To Seize Pyongyang if North Korea 
Invades South Korea" and "THE NEW YORK TIMES Reports Change in 
U.S. strategy in ROK Defense," the report quotes the U.S. 
newspaper as reporting on 6 February that "the United States 
recently amended its strategy on defending the ROK in order to 
cope with possible changes in the situation on the Korean 
peninsula, such as North Korea's recent moves for nuclear 
development." The report also quotes the U.S. paper as 
reporting that the new strategy was initiated by the former 
Commander of the U.S. Forces in Korea and supplemented by Gary 
Luck, the present Commander of the U.S. Forces in Korea. 
  Both the moderate HANGUK ILBO and the moderate TONG-A ILBO 
of 
7 February carry 300-word reports respectively by New York-based 
correspondent Kim Su-chong and reporter Kim Cha-ung in New York 
on the front page regarding the new U.S. strategy for defending 
the ROK. The reports cite THE NEW YORK TIMES as reporting that 
if North Korea attacks South Korea, the United States even has 
plans to seize Pyongyang and overthrow the Kim Il-song regime. 
They also note that the U.S. daily is concerned over North 
Korea's concentration of its conventional armed forces and 
weapons near the DMZ. 
  On page 5, the moderate TONG-A ILBO carries a 2,500-word 
"gist" of the contents of the new U.S. plan for defending the 
ROK. Under the headlines, "A Plan For Advance Beyond Pyongyang 
Yet To Be Determined," "North Korea Increases Artillery 
Positions Around Yongbyon Nuclear Site 10 Times," and "Five U.S. 
Radar Systems Now Under Operation," the gist includes two parts. 
Under the subhead of "North Korea's Strategy for a Southward 
Invasion and Its Military Strength," the first part describes 
the gist of the content of North Korea's strategy for invading 
South Korea and its military capability, while noting its recent 
preparations for a southward invasion, including the possible 
infiltration of its special commandos into the rear area of the 
ROK and U.S. forces, the deployment of more antiaircraft 
artillery units in Yongbyon area, and the troop concentration 
near the DMZ. 
  Under the subhead of "Plan For Defending The ROK" the second 
part describes the gist of the contents of plans for various 
joint operations between the ROK and U.S. forces, to repel North 
Korea's invasion. 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN on 7 February carries on its 
front page a brief 200-word article by New York-based 
correspondent Pak Su-man on the new U.S. strategy for defending 
the ROK and follows it up with a 900-word analysis of this 
development by the same reporter on page 4 under the headline of 
"From Whence Did the New U.S. Defense Strategy Emerge?" Noting 
recent reports of U.S. plans to deploy Patriot missiles and 
Apache helicopters to South Korea and to send an aircraft 
carrier to Korean waters, as well as the moves to refer the 
North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council, the 
article says that the new U.S. strategy for defending the ROK 
reflects the recent stance of the hard line group in the United 
States toward the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  Expressing concern that the U.S. strategy for "seizing 
Pyongyang" will aggravate Pyongyang, the article stresses that 
the strategy can be viewed as a sort of pressure on North Korea 
in connection with the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  Noting North Korea's possession of various types of 
missiles, 
including the Nodong-1 long-range missiles; its development of 
the Nodong-2 missile; and the recent reports on concentration of 
North Korean troops and huge amounts of various types of 
artillery guns near the DMZ, the article concludes that "even if 
North Korea accepts nuclear inspections, the Korean peninsula 
will still remain a dangerous region as long as these North 
Korean moves continue." 
  The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN on 7 February publishes on 
page 1 a 140-word report by Washington-based correspondent Chong 
Yon-chu on the new U.S. strategy for defending the ROK under the 
headlines: "The United States Has Established a Plan to `Seize 
Pyongyang in Case North Korea Invades the South'" and "THE NEW 
YORK TIMES Reports The United States is Stepping Up Its 
Strengthing of U.S. Forces in South Korea and Deployment of the 
Latest Weapons." The report briefly quotes THE NEW YORK TIMES 
report on the new U.S. strategy for defending the ROK. 
  The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN on 8 February publishes on 
page 4 a 900-word article by Washington-based correspondent Yi 
Kyong-hyon analyzing the new U.S. strategy for defending the 
ROK. The article notes the order by the U.S. Department of 
Defense to U.S. reservists to be ready for participation in the 
Team Spirit exercise, reporting that "this is an ultimatum 
calling for North Korea to clarify if it will accept nuclear 
inspections." The article notes that such stern countermeasures 
against North Korea have two meanings: One is that the stern 
countermeasures are a kind of procedure for the U.S. Government 
to take in case negotiations with North Korea on the nuclear 
issue fall through -- realizing it has become difficult to 
expect a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue -- and the other 
is that they are a demonstration to threaten North Korea to 
accept nuclear inspections. 
  Regarding the 6 February THE NEW YORK TIMES report on the 
new 
U.S. strategy for defending the ROK, the article notes that the 
strategy is also another means to apply pressure on the North 
Korean leadership in connection with the nuclear issue, adding 
that "in view of such a recent U.S. hard-line attitude we cannot 
rule out a possibility that the International Atomic Energy 
Agency, IAEA, and North Korea will continue negotiations on 
nuclear inspections." 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN on 8 February publishes on 
page 3 a 800-word editorial entitled "Washington's Hard-line 
Atmosphere Toward North Korea." The editorial notes the growing 
tension on the Korean peninsula, including North Korea's 
increasing military threat following the U.S. announcement of a 
plan to deploy Patriot missiles to South Korea, the resumption 
of the Team Spirit exercise in case North Korea continues to 
refuse nuclear inspections, and THE NEW YORK TIMES report on a 
new U.S. strategy for defending the ROK in which "seizure of 
Pyongyang" is mentioned. In conclusion, the editorial urges 
North Korea not to sever dialogue with the IAEA on nuclear 
inspections.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "U.S. `Sideshow'"] </F>
  [Text] A series of recent reports about the security 
situation on the Korean peninsula are too complex to understand. 
We are not even aware if North Korean-U.S. and North 
Korean-International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] negotiations on 
the nuclear issues are being held. The recent U.S. sideshow 
makes the security situation on the Korean peninsula more 
complex. 
  U.S. evangelist Billy Graham recently visited with President 
Clinton and Kim Il-song separately, conducting secret diplomacy. 
We do not dislike this event, however, nothing special resulted 
from either meeting, which fell short of our expectations. It 
is true, however, that the secret diplomacy made a contribution 
to easing the tension. We suspect that, besides a peaceful 
diplomatic gesture, the United States is conducting a sideshow, 
which is causing the people to think that this is a 
demonstration of military strength. The sideshow has been 
produced daily by the U.S. Defense Department and press. Let us 
cite some actual examples: 
  The United States will deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK; 
the U.S. aircraft carrier, Independence, is moving toward the 
waters of the ROK; if a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula, 
the ROK and U.S. Combined Forces can win in four months; if 
North Korea attacks the South, the United States will not be 
content with simply repulsing the North Korean forces, but will 
occupy Pyongyang and overturn Kim Il-song's regime; the United 
States has decided to conduct the Team Spirit exercise this 
year; and the United States will send more than 1,000 U.S. 
troops to the ROK... 
  What is an issue is that such reports are not discussed in 
advance with the ROK. The people have felt somewhat uneasy 
because the United States have unilaterally made such remarks 
without full negotiations with the ROK side. The ROK Government 
has not actively coped with such reports. There have been many 
cases when it has been too late for the ROK Government to cope 
with such reports. 
  Generally speaking, it seems there are two points that make 
the people feel uneasy about such a sideshow. One, the people 
are anxious over possible U.S.-ROK friction about the security 
of the Korean peninsula. Two, the demonstration of military 
strength, true or not, may incite North Korea. 
  Of course, we can understand why the United States is 
conducting such a sideshow. We think that the sideshow may be a 
U.S. strategy to resolve North Korea's nuclear issue before 22 
February when the meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors is 
expected to be held. 
  The ROK feels deeply that a war should not break out again 
on 
the Korean peninsula. For this reason, the ROK cannot but be 
surprised at the U.S. unilateral strategy. In addition, the ROK 
is doubtful that the sideshow will be helpful to resolve North 
Korea's nuclear issue.

<F P=106> [Interview with Stephen Linton, Columbia University </F>
professor and aide to Rev. Billy Graham, on latter's recent 
visit to North Korea, by An Hui-chang; date and place not given] 
  [Excerpts] Stephen Linton, 44, a professor of Colombia 
University who recently visited North Korea as an aide and 
interpreter for Rev. Billy Graham, arrived in the ROK on 6 
February. [passage omitted] 
  The following are questions and answers from the interview 
with Professor Linton: 
  [An Hui-chang] Having seen him up close, how would you say 
is Kim Il-song's health? 
  [Steve Linton] I cannot say whether he is unhealthy 
internally, but he appears to be healthy. His hands did not 
quiver, and he walked fine. His voice was husky like that of a 
chronic smoker, but his pronunciation was clear. His hearing 
ability, however, was so poor that even though he was wearing a 
hearing aid, sometimes someone nearby was asked to repeat in a 
loud voice what had just been said. 
  [An] People are very interested in the messages exchanged 
between President Clinton and Kim Il-song. 
  [Linton] We received President Clinton's message from the 
U.S. Embassy in Beijing before entering North Korea. I cannot 
provide details of what was in the messages, but I can say that 
they will help improve the current tense relations between the 
United States and North Korea. 
  [An] What was discussed at the luncheon between Rev. Graham 
and Kim Il-song? 
  [Linton] Morality and religion were the main topics. 
President Kim recalled that he had gone to church with his 
mother during his childhood and that a pastor had helped him. 
  [An] Many observers note a change in Kim Chong-il's status. 
What was the atmosphere like in North Korea? 
  [Linton] When I visited North Korea in 1992, President 
Kim Il-song said: "Kim Chong-il is in charge of 
administration." During my recent visit, however, I did not 
hear him mention this. Although President Kim did not mention 
any details, I came away with the impression that President Kim 
himself was leading overall state affairs. According to custom, 
we prepared gifts for both President Kim Il-song and Kim 
Chong-il, while North Korea only presented us with a gift in Kim 
Il-song's name. 
  [An] Why do you think North Korea invited Reverend Graham to 
visit? 
  [Linton] Reverend Graham published a book introducing 
various aspects of North Korea after his first visit in 1992. I 
believe that after reading the book, the North Korean people 
appreciated Rev. Graham's attempts not to distort [woegok] the 
North Korean system. [passage omitted]

  [Text] U.S. Ambassador to the ROK James Laney said on 4 
February that due to the U.S. Administration's policy to cut its 
budget, the U.S. Embassy to the ROK had already reduced its 
personnel and that the plan to cut its budget includes the plan 
to close the U.S. Consulate in Pusan. Ambassador Laney said 
this at a meeting with merchants and industrialists in Pusan to 
which the ambassador was invited. The meeting took place at the 
Pusan Chamber of Commerce and Industry. 
  He also said: "The Pusan Consulate issued 12 times more 
visas last year than in 1989. The consulate has made it 
convenient for Pusan citizens to get visas and contributed to 
promoting friendship between the ROK and the United States. 
Therefore, the U.S. Embassy is making efforts to maintain the 
consulate by explaining to the U.S. Government how important the 
consulate is."

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 7 (YONHAP) -- The government said on 
Monday that inter-Korean trade is not affected by the 
regulations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 
or the World Trade Organization (WTO) because it takes place 
inside the nation. 
  A senior official at the National Unification Board (NUB) 
said, "inter-Korean trade is naturally recognized as an 
'internal transaction' according to the basic agreement between 
South and North Korea concluded in early 1992 as well as to the 
United Nations Charter and the GATT regulations, both of which 
admit the self-determination rights of a divided country." 
  The government will send its final implementation plan to 
the 
gatt on Feb. 15, but the issue of inter-Korean trade will not be 
included, according to the official. 
  The clarification of NUB's position on inter-Korean trade 
came after Kyongsillyon, the Citizens' Coalition for Economic 
Justice (CCEJ), recently announced that inter-Korean trade 
should be recognized as an internal affair just as that of West 
and East Germany had formerly been.

  [Text] ROK firms have become active in participating in 
processing-on-commission trade with North Korea. As direct 
investment to North Korea is difficult due to the nuclear 
inspection issue, domestic firms are vigorously pressing ahead 
with processing-on-commission trade -- a form of indirect 
investment -- according to the businesses concerned. 
  Samsong Product Company has decided to increase by 30 
percent 
the amount of products manufactured by processing-on-commission, 
which reached $2.5 million last year. In addition, it has 
decided to expand orders for export to third countries, 
including Japan, under this form of trade. 
  Preparing for the ROK Government's possible authorization of 
a visit to North Korea within this year, Samsong has set up 
plans to send technicians to instruct North Korean workers on 
the advanced technology necessary for processing-on-commission 
trade for high-quality goods and to increase goods manufactured 
by processing-on-commission. 
  In 1993 Daewoo purchased 100,000 man's suits made by Sinsong 
Trade Company using processing-on-commission and has mapped out 
plans to expand processing-on-commission trade to higher quality 
clothes.

  [Text] Hong Kong, Feb. 7 (YONHAP) -- Kim Tae-chung, head 
of the non-profit Peace Foundation for the Asia-Pacific region, 
has called for an early summit meeting between South and North 
Korean Presidents Kim Yong-sam and Kim Il-song. 
  Kim, in Hong Kong on his way home from a 10-day tour to 
Sweden, Norway and Denmark, told foreign reporters here that the 
two heads of state should meet in Seoul or Pyongyang as soon as 
possible to end their hostility and distrust, and instead open a 
new era of cooperation and reconciliation. 
  A meeting between the leaders of the capitalist South and 
communist North itself would be significant, the long-time 
opposition leader said. 
  Kim, chairman of the private think tank on Korean 
unification 
and Asian democratization, made it clear that he had no 
intention of meeting North Korean leaders before the summit nor 
did he wish to return to politics.

  [Text] Pusan, Feb. 8 (YONHAP) -- A North Korean logger 
working in Siberia has defected to South Korea aboard a Russian 
ship, the Sungwon shipping company said on Tuesday. 
  Pak Chang-hwan, 39, boarded the Russian passenger ship "Olga 
Androvskaya" in Vladivostok last Friday bound for Pusan and was 
handed over to the Agency for National Security Planning as soon 
as he landed in Pusan on Saturday. 
  According to Sungwon officials, Pak paid the captain of the 
Russian ship more than 1,000 U.S. dollars to help him defect to 
South Korea. 
  Sungwon is a shipping agent for Russian vessels stopping at 
the South Korean port.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 8 (YONHAP) -- South Korea will make an 
early withdrawal of its troops in Somalia for U.N. peacekeeping 
operations [PKO] by April, the Foreign Ministry announced 
Tuesday. The 250-man Army engineering unit named Sangnoksu 
(Evergreen) was to fulfill one year of service to July, but 
pushed up the withdrawal date due to an early pullout by Western 
countries, the ministry said. The decision was also prompted by 
a request from the Unosom Command post to relocate the South 
Korean unit, it said. 
  South Korea had dispatched the Army engineering unit in its 
first participation in a U.N. peacekeeping mission. The unit 
was responsible for road construction linking major cities in 
Somalia. 
  The U.N. Security Council decided last Friday to have the 
peacekeeping unit return to such traditional duties as 
overseeing humanitarian aid while diminishing the scale of 
stationed troops. 
  The United States announced last October its PKO troopers 
would leave Somalia by March 31 this year. 
  Italy, which has been in charge of security in the area 
where 
the South Korean unit was stationed, also decided to withdraw by 
the same date.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 8 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
instructed security-related cabinet ministers on Tuesday to do 
their utmost to help resolve the North Korean nuclear issue 
through dialogue even if it is referred to the U.N. Security 
Council. 
  "The (South Korean) Government will not abandon its efforts 
to resolve the North Korean nuclear problem through dialogue 
even if it is referred to the Security Council," Kim said. "Even 
if dialogue fails, the government has to prepare for everything 
so that the people can trust their government and have 
confidence in the government with regard to their safety and 
survival," Kim said. 
  The presidential instruction came at a Chongwadae 
[presidential offices] meeting attended by Prime Minister Yi 
Hoe-chang, Deputy Prime Minister and head of the National 
Unification Board Yi Yong-tok, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, 
Home Affairs Minister Choe Hyong-u, Defense Minister Yi 
Pyong-tae and others. 
  The meeting was convened amid rising international tension 
after the United States said it will have to refer the North 
Korean nuclear question to the U.N. Security Council if 
Pyongyang and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) fail 
to reach agreement on IAEA inspections by Feb. 21. 
  President Kim reiterated the Seoul government's position 
that 
it does not want to see North Korea isolated from the world 
community. 
  "North Korea will have to allow comprehensive inspection by 
the IAEA of its nuclear facilities as it has promised, and a 
political solution to the nuclear issue has to be achieved 
through sincere dialogue between South and North Korea," Kim 
said. 
  "North Korea is facing a grave point by refusing to accept 
(IAEA) inspection," Kim said. "The (Seoul) government should 
maintain the principles and consistency of its policy while 
exercising flexibility in order to resolve the nuclear problem." 
  President Kim went on to stress that "it is important above 
all else to maintain close cooperation with the United States 
and other countries," according to Chong Chong-uk, senior 
presidential secretary for foreign and national security affairs. 
  Kim then told Foreign Minister Han to hold close 
consultations with U.S. Government leaders when he visits 
Washington on Wednesday. 
  With regard to the perceived rise in tension on the Korean 
peninsula, the president said that the ministers should inform 
the people of as many developments as possible. 
  In addition, Kim instructed them to strengthen 
inter-ministry 
cooperation as the North Korean nuclear issue reaches an 
important turning point before and after the IAEA Board of 
Governors' meeting Feb. 21. 
  Briefing reporters on the background of Tuesday's security 
meeting, Chong said that considerable efforts will be made to 
peacefully resolve the nuclear question even after it is brought 
to the Security Council. 
  Chong said he did not believe the Security Council would 
impose economic sanctions immediately against North Korea. 
  Rather, the world body would have to go through many stages 
before deciding to impose sanctions. 
  That is why the Seoul government will continue its efforts 
to 
resolve the question through dialogue even after it is referred 
to the Security Council, he said. 
  Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae reported to the meeting that 
the frequency of exercises by the North Korean Army and Air 
Force has been on the rise recently. His ministry has obtained 
evidence that defensive exercises around the nuclear complex in 
Yongbyong, north of Pyongyang, are being strengthened and work 
to reinforce underground facilities stepped up, Yi said. 
  North Korea is also stepping up propaganda efforts to 
denounce South Korea, he said. Despite these actions, Yi said 
there were no signs that North Korea would launch a provocation 
in the immediate future. Asked whether South Korea has been able 
to detect signs of an imminent provocation by the North, Chong 
said that under the worst circumstances, "we can detect it one 
or two days ahead." 
  "The people can trust our ability to detect it," Chong said. 
  The reason that President Kim convened the year's first 
national security meeting one day before the three-day lunar new 
year's holiday begins, is because the deadline for resolving the 
North Korean nuclear issue is approaching fast and because there 
is no indication it will be solved soon. 
  President Kim apparently wanted to reassess the government's 
policy and dispel the rising sense of anxiety here, fueled by 
foreign reports that warn of an imminent crisis in Korea.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 7 (YONHAP) -- Two former Navy generals, 
convicted of taking bribes in connection with the Yulgok program 
and officers' promotions, were released through a stay of 
execution on Monday. The Seoul High Public Prosecutor's Office 
sentenced former Navy Chief of the General Staff Kim Chol-u to 
three years' imprisonment, four years' stay of execution and a 
300-million won fine. 
  Kim was sentenced to six years in prison at the first trial. 
He was charged with receiving money from an arms dealer in 
connection with the Navy's destroyer purchase project. 
  The former commander of the Marine Corps, Cho Ki-yop, was 
sentenced to two years and six months' imprisonment, three 
years' stay of execution and a 60-million won fine. He was 
sentenced to three years in jail at the first trial. 
  Another former Navy Chief of the General Staff, Kim 
Chong-ho, 
was sentenced to three years' imprisonment and a 373-million won 
fine. He received a six-year prison term at the first trial. 
  The judges said, "the defendants admit they received money, 
though denying the money had some connection with the promotion 
of military officers. But we feel the money has some connection 
with the promotions. We are reducing their terms of 
imprisonment because they appeared before the prosecution 
voluntarily before the prosecutor's summons." 
  Meanwhile, the head of Haksan Co., Chong Ui-sung, who was 
charged with giving bribes to Kim Chol-u, was sentenced to one 
year and six months' imprisonment and three years' stay of 
execution.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 7 (YONHAP) -- Rep. Pae Myong-kuk of the 
ruling Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] has decided to resign from 
the central executive council and as chairman of the South 
Kyongsang Provincial chapter of his party, it was reported 
Monday. Pae is under suspicion of having conspired with an aide 
to former Rep. Pak Chae-kyu to expose a scandal in which Pak had 
received bribes amounting to 200 million won from his supporters 
in 1989. Pae replaced Pak at the National Assembly after Pak's 
conviction on charges of accepting the bribes. But two weeks 
ago, Pak's aide came forward and said he had exposed the scandal 
at the instigation of Pae, from whom he received 2 million won. 
  In resigning from the party post and the provincial 
chairmanship, Pae took "moral responsibility" for the affair 
when he called on DLP Secretary-General Mun Chong-su Monday 
morning. 
  During the meeting, Mun said Pae apologized for causing 
trouble for the party and the secretary-general. 
  "Rep. Pae will officially announce his intention to resign 
from those posts Monday," Mun said. 
  Pae insisted, however, that he had not instigated former 
Rep. 
Pak's aide, Kim Tae-wol, to bring bribery charges against his 
boss. But he admitted that he had given 2 million won to Kim 
Tae-wol after learning that Pak had received bribes.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 7 (YONHAP) -- The government decided 
Monday to allow partial foreign capital access to the so-called 
Social Overhead Capital (SOC) projects. 
  In discussing ways to organize funds for state 
infrastructure 
projects, the Finance, Trade, Industry, and Energy, and 
Transportation Ministries agreed with the Economic Planning 
Board (EPB) on approving foreign investment to some extent by 
revising the foreign capital inducement act. 
  Putting up funds for infrastructure ventures would not mean 
that foreigners could exercise management rights, a senior EPB 
official said, adding that their participation would be limited 
to joining a local consortium or buying small stakes. 
  In addition, when launching a joint venture with private 
companies, public corporations can supply no more than 50 
percent of financing and are deprived of voting rights so as to 
fully guarantee private management.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- Japan launched a new package 
of stimulus measures Tuesday [8 February], pouring a record 
15.25 trillion yen into the economy in a bid to stem the 
prolonged recession and show its commitment to reducing the 
country's huge trade surplus. 
  The centerpiece of the package, endorsed at an evening 
special cabinet meeting, is income and other tax cuts worth 5.85 
trillion yen decided earlier by the coalition parties after four 
days of marathon debate on how to cover the resulting revenue 
shortfall. 
  Other key elements are 6 trillion yen in additional spending 
on public works for the current fiscal year through March, 1.2 
trillion yen to boost public housing loans, 1.36 trillion yen in 
measures to help smaller businesses, and deregulations to 
stimulate the real estate market and facilitate the liquidation 
of nonperforming bank loans. 
  With previous four public works-led packages already 
totaling 
some 30 trillion yen failing to lift the economy, the government 
decided for the first time to include tax cuts, hoping to make 
the package its final and decisive pump-primer. 
  The tax-led measures also came amid U.S. pressure on Japan 
for an income tax cut to boost domestic demand as a contribution 
to reducing its huge trade surplus. 
  Japan posted a record surplus for the second straight year 
in 
1993 in its politically sensitive current accounts, including 
goods and services trade. The statistics were released Monday. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is no doubt relieved by the 
agreement after a two-week delay caused by disputes over the 
now-enacted political reform bills as well as the tax issue. 
  Hosokawa said at a press meeting he expects "substantial" 
effects from the tax cuts, "to meet expectations both at home 
and abroad." 
  Hosokawa had been urging his ministers to prepare the 
package, to be followed by a third fiscal 1993 extra budget and 
the fiscal 1994 budget, in order to have it ready before his 
meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton on Friday. 
  The Finance Ministry is to compile its draft budgets on 
Thursday, but uncertainty still remains because of the extremely 
tight schedule, ministry officials said. 
  An official of the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) which 
compiled the package told reporters that a large chunk of the 
new outlays would be funded by the third extra budget, and the 
tax cuts would be included in the fiscal 1994 budget. 
  Of the total, 10.2 trillion yen is to boost the economy, he 
said, estimating that the gross national product (GNP) would 
expand by a nominal 2.2 percent beyond the fiscal 1992 GNP, the 
latest available figures, over a one-year period. 
  But he noted that the effects would not appear all at once 
in 
fiscal 1994. 
  The package is broadly divided into three parts, in line 
with 
their expected effects and results in stimulating the economy. 
  With the first part that includes tax cuts, public works and 
housing loans, the government is aiming to boost domestic demand 
to help the economy "overcome the current tough condition" in 
the short term, the EPA official said. 
  The second and third parts are intended to put the economy 
"on a full-fledged recovery phase in fiscal 1994" and to promote 
"stable growth in and after fiscal 1995" by solving structural 
problems since the collapse of the "bubble" economy in the late 
1980s and by facilitating forward-looking corporate activities. 
  Under the second part, the package calls for special tax 
breaks, 2.78 trillion yen advance purchases of public works land 
sites and other measures to stimulate the real estate market. 
It also calls for various deregulations in the financial and 
securities market primarily to help banks liquidate their 
nonperforming loans. 
  For the advance land purchases, the government will also 
earmark 500 billion yen for a quasi-public institute that 
supports private-sector city developments. 
  Also included are additional lending and other forms of 
support for smaller businesses and 10 billion yen for job 
programs amid increasing labor adjustments. 
  Farmers will be granted 230 billion yen in public works and 
through other plans to help them cope with international 
competition following Japan's decision to free its rice and 
other agricultural markets under the GATT-sponsored Uruguay 
Round of multilateral talks. 
  With the third part, the government is pushing for the 
easing 
and lifting of various microeconomic regulations, including 
those under the Antimonopoly Law. 
  A loan system worth 10 billion yen is to be offered by the 
Japan Development Bank and other public financial institutions 
to assist investment in new businesses. 
  Import promotion is also spelled out in the third part, with 
the emphasis on exhibitions and import centers, along with the 
recently-revealed action plan for government procurement. 
  Aside from all these government measures, the package also 
calls for "appropriate and mobile management in monetary policy 
with a careful watch on domestic and overseas economic trends 
and the international currency situation."

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- Following is the gist of the 
government's just-unveiled 15.25 trillion yen economic relief 
package. 
  -- Tax reductions totaling 5.85 trillion yen will be 
implemented. They include: 
  - 3.84 trillion yen cut in income tax 
  - 1.63 trillion yen cut in residential tax 
  - both cuts are effective only for fiscal 1994. 
  - the special corporation surtax, effective since April 
1992, will be scrapped. 
  - the 4.5 percent consumption tax for autos will be 
lowered to bring it in line with the 3 percent tax rate imposed 
on other goods and services. 
  - the two measures, to come into effect on April 1, 1994, 
will bring about 380 billion yen in tax returns. 
  -- Additional public works related outlays worth 7.2 
trillion yen are envisaged. They include 1.5 trillion yen for 
the government's advance purchases of land for public purposes 
and 1.2 trillion yen loans by the Governmental Housing Loan 
Corp. to finance purchases of an estimated 70,000 more houses. 
  -- Another 500 billion yen will be set aside for advance 
land purchases by the organization for promoting urban 
development, a government-affiliated agency. 
  -- Aid to small enterprises worth 1.36 trillion yen is 
envisaged. 
  -- 100 billion yen in funds will be allocated to nurture 
new promising businesses. 
  -- In view of expected damage to Japanese farmers when the 
rice market opens from 1995, 230 billion yen in emergency aid 
for growers is planned. 
  -- Another 10 billion yen will be set aside for government 
aid for companies that are rationalizing labor. The funds are 
also designed to create job opportunities. 
  -- Further deregulation is to be implemented.

<F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa at his </F>
official Tokyo residence with unidentified domestic 
correspondents -- live] 
  [Text] [Dean of press corps] The prime minister's office 
has asked that we limit this news conference to about 20 
minutes. However, I think it could last longer depending on the 
questions. Mr. Prime Minister, I would like to ask you if that 
is all right? 
  [Hosokawa] Yes. 
  [Dean of press corps] As dean of the press corps, I would 
first like to ask three questions. Following that the other 
reporters will have a chance. 
  [Hosokawa] Before I field any questions may I say something? 
  [Dean of press corps] Please, go ahead. 
  [Hosokawa] In response to an agreement reached at a meeting 
of representatives of the ruling coalition parties this morning, 
leaders of the government and the ruling coalition parties held 
a meeting at midday to make a final decision on the tax issue in 
which people are greatly interested. Before outlining the 
agreement, I would like to point out that the national welfare 
tax that I announced, together with our policymaking process, 
have been publicly criticized and I would like to offer my frank 
apology to the people for this. 
  I would like to outline the agreement. The first point is 
that income tax cuts amounting to 6 trillion yen will be 
implemented ahead of a tax rise in fiscal year 1994. The second 
is that a consultative body will be set up within the ruling 
coalition to discuss tax reform. The consultative body is 
mandated to discuss how to fashion a vision of a welfare 
society, how the people should share the burden of a society of 
senior citizens, and how the current tax system should be 
reformed. The consultative body is also mandated to discuss 
ways to cut taxes and secure financial resources to make up for 
a fiscal shortfall arising from the tax cuts. Relevant laws 
will be enacted at a Diet session within this year upon 
agreement among the ruling coalition parties. I have recently 
proposed a draft of the tax reform on the basis of discussions 
held by the Government Tax System Research Council since last 
autumn, and on a series of lively consultations between the 
government and ruling coalition parties. But a ruling partner 
has raised an objection to the tax reform draft. In response, I 
have asked the ruling coalition parties to coordinate their 
views again and they reached agreement today. With the ruling 
coalition parties reaching the agreement, a bill on cutting 
income tax by 6 trillion yen will be introduced to the Diet 
during its current session. I understand that a clear path has 
been drawn toward drastic tax system reform. Discussion will be 
conducted by the consultative body, which will take into account 
the ideas I have proposed. I intend to work out a draft of the 
government's plan for reform of the tax system based on a 
proposal to be drawn up by the ruling coalition parties. 
  [Dean of the press corps] Mr. Prime Minister, you said a 
while ago that you apologize to the people. The national 
welfare tax that you announced has been scrapped. That means 
your decision has been overturned. Mr. Prime Minister, how are 
you going to take responsibility for that? I think you are 
politically responsible for the public criticism. Mr. Prime 
Minister, would you explain what you have apologized about? 
  [Hosokawa] I believe the biggest issue is our policy 
decision process. Of course, people have talked about various 
aspects of the national welfare tax. Among other things, they 
have pointed out that the policymaking process was overly hasty. 
I have to apologize to the people for creating that impression. 
  The policymaking process of the ruling coalition parties is 
one of interparty negotiations and I believe this kind of 
process has its limitations. As a result, the outcome of 
interparty discussions are prone to be leaked. I think the 
process probably creates the impression that the ruling 
coalition parties are in disarray over policy. As for the 
importance of my remarks as prime minister, I have always kept 
that in mind. I believe that I will undergo a process of trial 
and error in the course of making policy decisions. If there is 
something I need to correct, I will not hesitate to correct it. 
  [Dean of the press corps] At one time there existed a 
situation wherein it was questionable which side would formulate 
a compromise plan between the government and the ruling 
coalition parties. Some have pointed out that such a situation 
was created by the ambiguity of the prime minister's 
instructions and his lack of leadership. Prime Minister, what 
do you think of this criticism? 
  [Hosokawa] Since the tax issue is important, I have asked 
the ruling coalition parties to engage in full discussions of 
the issue. My proposal for the national welfare tax was rejected 
by one of the ruling coalition parties, and the expression 
scrapping has been used. Nonetheless, I have asked the meeting 
of the representatives of the ruling coalition parties to again 
discuss in detail the tax issue, and this morning the ruling 
coalition parties reached the agreement I mentioned at this news 
conference. 
  [Dean of the press corps] Prime minister, you have said the 
ruling coalition parties will discuss the reform of the current 
tax system and the securing of financial resources to make up 
for a fiscal shortfall incurred from future tax cuts. Prime 
Minister, would you explain through what process the ruling 
coalition parties will discuss them? Prime Minister, you said 
you have asked the ruling coalition parties to discuss reforming 
the current tax system, taking your proposal into account. 
Prime Minister, some feel your proposal has been scrapped. 
What do you think of this? 
  [Hosokawa] The ruling coalition parties will discuss ways to 
reform the current tax system. As for your question about 
through what process the ruling coalition parties hold 
discussions, I do not know. However, they will draw a 
conclusion within this year on the issue of securing financial 
resources to make up for the financial shortfalls arising from 
tax cuts. I hope they will work on drawing a conclusion to the 
issue at the earliest date. 
  [Dean of the press corps] Then, please, ask questions. 
  [Correspondent] My question concerns how the tax cuts will 
spur the economy. According to an estimate, a salaried 
household with two children and an annual income of 5 million 
yen will benefit only about 40,000 yen a year from the tax cuts. 
A salaried household with two children and an annual income of 
8 million yen will benefit only 160,000 yen a year from the tax 
cuts. Given these tax benefits, I wonder if the tax cuts will 
generate the desired effect of stimulating the economy. Prime 
Minister, what do you think? 
  [Hosokawa] It is very hard for me to explain the effect of 
the tax cuts in numerical and quantitative terms. However, we 
need to put our nation's economy on a path to full-fledged 
recovery. To that end, we should adopt various policies, and 
our adoption of those policies has been strongly demanded by 
foreign nations and our own people. The reductions in the 
income tax will spur personal spending and investments in 
equipment and plants, bringing the pervasive effect to the 
entire economy. My view is that the cuts in the income tax will 
contribute to a recovery of the economy. 
  [Correspondent] Prime Minister, you have just expressed your 
apology and have pointed out that the policy decision process is 
at issue. Given the last week of political vacuum, I would like 
to ask you, how do you plan to change the process in the future? 
  [Hosokawa] My answer may be a repetition of what I have just 
said. Various discussions held by the coalition government have 
been made public, and this is a good aspect of it. As I just 
mentioned a while ago, the ruling coalition parties have given 
the impression that they delayed in making a final decision 
prior to making the decision public. They present these two 
aspects. Now, the ruling coalition parties hold the meeting of 
their secretaries in charge of the policy affairs, the meeting 
of secretaries in charge of the tax affairs, and the meeting of 
their representatives. The government and the ruling coalition 
parties hold their meetings. Major issues are decided at those 
meetings. I intend to work to prevent a recurrence of the 
latest situation in the future. I believe I will have to keep 
that point in mind. 
  [Correspondent] What about the issue of who is responsible? 
  [Hosokawa] As I have said, I think this has proved a very 
difficult issue. It has not only involved negotiation among the 
ruling parties on the issue itself, but discussion about what 
the coalition administration ought to be like. As this is our 
first, fully fledged coalition administration and it is still 
new, I would hope people will understand that we are bound to 
have some trial and error. The ruling coalition parties will 
work to prevent a recurrence of such a situation, and they will 
concede to each other when they need to do so. I intend to work 
hard to keep the coalition government functioning smoothly. 
  [Correspondent] You made similar remarks when you met 
reporters on Friday. But I am sure you did not offer such an 
apology at that time. Have you changed your mind over the past 
few days in now making an apology? 
  [Hosokawa] Of course I had such feelings when I met 
reporters a few days ago, but the issue was not resolved at the 
time. I intended to express my views concerning the current 
confusion when the issue was resolved and the prospects for the 
tax issue were clearer. 
  [Correspondent] Do you still believe the idea of introducing 
a national welfare tax is right? 
  [Hosokawa] Since last fall, from about 3 September when I 
attended a meeting of the Tax Commission, I have expressed my 
views about how the taxation system should be changed to reflect 
the fact that society will have to deal with increasing numbers 
of senior citizens. There is also the issue of how tax cuts 
should be implemented to deal with the current economic 
recession. The Tax Commission discussed these issues for more 
than two months to try to seek a way to satisfy these two 
factors. After that, discussion has been held at policymaking 
meetings of secretaries general of the ruling coalition parties, 
meetings of their economic consultative body, and meetings of 
representatives of the coalition. I have repeatedly stated my 
views at Diet sessions since last September. I also asked the 
Tax Commission to discuss the tax issue in line with my view 
that unless a well-balanced taxation system of income, 
consumption, and property taxes is established, Japan cannot 
prepare for the future aging of society. This basic view has 
not changed. 
  [Correspondent] Do you mean that you want the ruling 
coalition parties to discuss the tax issue based on the idea, 
which you recently announced, of introducing a 7 percent tax in 
three years? 
  [Hosokawa] No, I do not. I hope that the consultative body 
of the ruling coalition will hold discussions in the future 
based on my basic view. At present, though, I am not sticking 
to the tax rate or anything. 
  [Correspondent] I repeat a question about the national 
welfare tax. The proposal to introduce the national welfare tax 
has been killed. Do you refuse to withdraw or give up your 
proposal, and do you intend to maintain the need for a national 
welfare tax in the future? 
  [Hosokawa] No, I do not. I announced earlier that the 
proposal was politically frozen. After it was frozen, a new 
decision was made at a meeting of representatives of the ruling 
coalition. As I stated earlier, I think that they will probably 
discuss the tax issue while keeping my view in mind. 
  [Correspondent] Prime Minister, you are holding this news 
conference to apologize to the people for what you have done. 
Prime Minister, you have said that it is inevitable for the 
coalition government to undergo a process of trial and error, 
while repeatedly saying you are aware of your political 
responsibility. I wonder if you are really reflecting on what 
you have done? This is my frank feeling. Prime Minister, you 
called a news conference to explicitly say to the people that 
you plan to adopt the national welfare tax. The people see the 
reversal of your plan to adopt the tax system as inconceivable. 
This is what the people frankly feel. At this news conference, 
I wonder if you feel political responsibility. What do you 
think of your political responsibility? 
  [Hosokawa] I think your question is very tough and 
forthright. As Japan moves toward a society of senior citizens, 
Japanese should share their due burden for society. I have said 
as much to that effect at the Diet. I also made that statement 
when I announced the government's vision of a welfare society. 
I have consistently thought of measures to be taken for a 
society of senior citizens. Certainly, though, I will not deny 
that the national welfare tax was announced in a sudden and 
hasty manner. I am tasked with tentatively deciding on the 
fiscal 1994 budget and compiling the third supplementary budget. 
I also have to announce the government's fiscal measures for 
local governments. And I have to prepare for Japan-U.S. summit 
talks. I made a decision on the national welfare tax under very 
difficult circumstances. I do not deny I was hasty in making 
the decision. I frankly apologize for my haste. I hope the 
people will understand such circumstances. 
  [Correspondent] Prime Minister, you have repeatedly said 
that the process is what is at issue. What is at issue is not 
the process. Prime Minister, what you announced to the people 
has been reversed, and I think that as the top official in 
charge of our nation, you are responsible for that reversal. 
Prime Minister, my feeling is you cannot be released from 
responsibility by simply saying the process is at issue. Prime 
Minister, do you not share my feelings? 
  [Hosokawa] I have said I will constantly keep the weight of 
my remarks as prime minister in mind. Although I am sorry for 
repeating my statement, my coalition government is the first 
full-fledged coalition government Japan has had. There have 
been various discussions. I announced the national welfare tax 
not as the coalition government's proposal, but as my own 
proposal. My proposal has not been accepted by the ruling 
coalition parties and I would like to offer my frank apology on 
that point. I intend to resolve the tax issue on the basis of 
the agreement reached among the ruling coalition parties. 
  [Correspondent] As the Japan-U.S. summit meeting is to be 
held on 11 February, do you think the United States will rate 
the tax cut plan highly even though the legislation on the 
6-trillion-yen tax cut will be effective for only one year? 
  [Hosokawa] I think the United States will rate the tax cut 
plan highly. 
  [Correspondent] It seems from what has been said so far that 
you admit the previous decisionmaking process was faulty, but 
feel this was an issue which required the approval of the ruling 
coalition parties. Contradicting what you have said since you 
referred the tax issue to the Tax Commission, you eventually 
came up with the idea of the national welfare tax. As we look 
at the problem, it seems questionable whether thorough 
discussion has actually ever been held among the ruling 
coalition parties, considering the course of events that lead to 
your making such an announcement. For example, even Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who happens to be here, 
said he was unaware of your decision until the last minute. Do 
you intend to change this manner of decisionmaking? This is the 
first question, and here is another. It has been revealed the 
tax cuts will be not be permanent. I feel the truth is that the 
real problem has been shelved because the legislation is 
effective for only one year. Anyhow, as there will be a 
6-trillion-yen revenue shortfall due to the planned tax cut, you 
say that necessary steps will be taken to secure a definite 
source of revenue to make up such shortfalls and that a drastic 
reform of the tax system will be implemented by the year-end. 
Are we to understand that you intend to sincerely stake your 
political future on carrying this out by the year-end to fulfill 
your responsibility to the people? 
  [Hosokawa] I shall answer the latter question first. The 
government and the ruling coalition parties will make concerted 
efforts to reform the current tax system. I believe the passage 
of tax system reform legislation, within the period I have 
promised to the public, is the fulfillment of my most important 
political responsibility. As for what I think of the 
decisionmaking process, I must frankly admit that this is a 
rather difficult matter. Even yesterday, as a result of the 
situation, I held discussions on the tax issue with the chief 
cabinet minister and others. Getting down to business, we asked 
each other what steps could be taken. In form, there are 
various forums, such as a meeting of secretaries general on 
policy affairs. However, we have here five secretaries general. 
This is different from the situation in which a single party is 
in power: Then there is only one secretary general, one general 
council chairman, and one policy research council chairman. In 
our case, there are five policy research council chairmen, five 
general council chairmen, and five secretaries general. Matters 
must be cleared at these various levels. I am amazed by the 
difficulties we face. Frankly speaking, I realize we must 
correct these problems as much as possible. 
  [Correspondent] You mentioned the term political 
responsibility. I would like to confirm that this means you 
intend to resign from your post as prime minister? 
  [Hosokawa] No, I did not say that. I said that for the 
government and ruling coalition parties to try to their utmost 
to fulfill their roles constitutes fulfillment of political 
responsibility. 
  [Correspondent] Is this what you refer to as the prime 
minister's responsibility? 
  [Hosokawa] As I have just said, it is nothing more than 
that. I believe that to put all our efforts into this and get 
tax measures implemented would satisfy the expectations of the 
people. 
  [Correspondent] The Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] 
has taken quite a hard-line stance on the tax issue, even 
threatening to break away from the coalition government. As the 
breakaway failed to materialize this time, does it mean that in 
the future no party within the coalition will ever take steps 
toward this end? 
  [Hosokawa] I do not know about that. We cannot tell what 
kind of problems may arise in the future, nor what kind of 
approach each party will take on the various problems. In each 
case, parties will have to make self-sacrifices. I believe the 
ruling coalition parties will make every effort to hold 
themselves together in the future. It is my earnest desire that 
we all try to do this. 
  [Correspondent] Prime Minister, ever since your 
inauguration you have advocated consumer-oriented policies and 
politics geared toward the people. However, this time we have 
the impression you have been turning your attention to 
Nagata-cho [a district in Tokyo where the Diet building is 
located] and Kasumigaseki [a district in Tokyo where government 
ministries and agencies are located]. Does this not run 
contrary to your principles? 
  [Hosokawa] I feel taxes are certainly an issue that draws 
strong public interest. However, as I have repeatedly said, I 
question whether it is correct to maintain a tax system which 
deprives people of their desire to work while in the prime of 
their lives. In order to construct an aging society which is 
full of vitality, I think everyone of us needs to share 
necessary burdens. Otherwise society as such will cease to exist 
in the future. In this regard, we have to say things which 
people do not want to hear, though of course it is true that 
sovereignty resides with the people. We must all have a common 
understanding and determination to construct a new society. I 
believe politicians should say this to the people in a 
straightforward manner. 
  [Correspondent] Do you not think that a willingness to 
discuss this with the people is important? 
  [Hosokawa] That is correct. 
  [Correspondent] Do you not think that the people disapproved 
of your unilateral announcement, and that the manner in which 
you made the announcement was the issue of debate? 
  [Hosokawa] Regarding that point, as I have said before, I 
feel a thorough discussion has not been held. However, the tax 
commission is an organization which consists of experts 
representing the people. I asked the tax commission in early 
September -- 3 September -- to study how to establish a tax 
system that is well-balanced regarding consumer capital and 
income. Moreover, I had parties hold discussions on the issue 
within their respective intraparty organizations. Therefore, I 
feel a certain amount of time has been spent on studying the 
issue. However, I also agree that more time should be spent on 
it. 
  [Correspondent] Looking back at recent movements, we get 
the impression that the Ministry of Finance holds strong power 
within the government. You have launched various reform plans, 
and now it seems you will have to start changing the ministries 
and agencies. We are uncertain about your reform plans. 
  [Hosokawa] I often hear that. However, it is not correct. 
Needless to say, the financial authorities have their own ideas. 
But even during the recent events, the financial authorities 
have hardly had a chance to talk to me directly, except 
yesterday or the day before when I asked the minister of finance 
and other financial authorities to come to the official 
residence. I instructed them to listen to the opinions of the 
coalition parties and cooperate with them in ironing out our 
differences. The Ministry of Finance did not insist on their 
demands or try to steamroll us. In a sense, it is natural for 
them to say no to what they cannot accept; their stance is 
natural. Otherwise they cannot fulfill their responsibilities 
as financial authorities. I think the important thing is for 
politicians to take the lead or give guidance to the financial 
authorities, while also giving consideration to their opinions. 
  [Correspondent] You have mentioned several times the 
government's Tax System Research Council as an example that you 
have spent enough time on discussions. But the Tax System 
Research Council is a government organization, and its members 
were not elected by the people. When it came to tax issues 
while it was in power, the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] spent 
forever on discussions with the party. To the bureaucrats, it 
might have appeared a very inefficient process of flattering and 
pacifying the voters by merely listening to their complaints. 
However, this time the process of discussion was reported by 
the media, so the people were able to pinpoint the problems. 
They were able to think along with the politicians. Prime 
Minister, do you think the LDP's endless discussions within the 
party were inefficient? 
  [Hosokawa] Well, I do not know. As I said earlier, the 
coalition administration is still in the stage of trial and 
error, and is trying to find an ideal way of carrying out 
discussions not only on the tax issue but also on other matters 
as well. I also said there may be many points which we need to 
continue to improve. The Policy Board is studying the tax 
system. We are also talking about the possibility of forming an 
organ which is similar to the LDP's Tax System Research Council. 
We will try to form such an organ after reaching a consensus 
among the coalition parties. 
  Any more questions? 
  [Dean of Press Corps] Do you have any more questions?

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry [MOF] 
on Tuesday [8 February] released a set of measures to help 
financial institutions dispose of bad loans as part of the 
government's new pump-priming package. 
  The administrative guideline attached to the new 15.25 
trillion yen stimulus package focuses on liquidation of the 
so-called "restructured loans," or loans for which banks have 
reduced or suspended interest payments as part of a bailout 
program for financially troubled borrowers. 
  The ministry said it will allow banks to set up a special 
entity to shift their restructured loans to nonbank money 
lenders such as housing loan companies. 
  The ministry also said it will expand the scope of a special 
write-off reserve account to include loans that have a risk of 
default. 
  These steps are designed to rebuild public confidence in 
Japan's financial system which was substantially eroded 
following the bursting of the speculation-driven "bubble 
economy" of the late 1980s. 
  The latest package is expected to maximize the effects of 
measures envisioned in an administrative guideline for the 
financial industry unveiled in August 1992, a ministry official 
told a press conference. 
  The amount of restructured loans held by Japan's 21 major 
banks is estimated to far exceed some 14 trillion yen in 
nonperforming loans they reported at the end of last September, 
which has weighed heavily on their earnings. 
  Banks are not required to disclose the size of restructured 
loans but are required to do so on loans to bankrupt borrowers, 
nonperforming loans or those with interest payments in arrears 
for six months or longer. 
  Currently, loans recognized by the Finance Ministry as bad 
assets can be provided for in the special reserve account, in 
which half the outstanding claims are free of tax. Ministry 
recognition requires that loans be unrecoverable, such as those 
to bankrupt borrowers. 
  Under the new step, banks will be allowed to use their own 
judgment to write off risky loans on a taxable basis, the 
ministry said. 
  The aim of the company tasked with liquidating restructured 
loans is to help avoid sales of such loans to third parties, 
which hamper smooth rescue of the troubled nonbank, the official 
said. 
  A creditor bank sells to a new entity its loan principal to 
a 
nonbank at discounted prices that reflect market prices. The 
bank then uses the proceeds to set up the entity. 
  The mechanism improves the bank's financial standing by 
producing a tax-free loss equal to the gap between the principal 
and the selling price. 
  The guideline calls for stable fund supply by financial 
institutions. 
  Specifically, it says banks should adopt an accommodative 
lending stance for small companies to meet their fund needs in 
new business areas. 
  In order to promote bank lending, the package also 
recommends 
that banks boost their capital base through issuance of 
preferred stocks and subordinated bonds. 
  The guideline says the Finance Ministry, in order to ensure 
stable housing and land supply, will ease restrictions on real 
estate-related lending. 
  It says the ministry will continue to ask financial 
institutions to refrain from resorting to the sale of 
stockholdings to generate profits ahead of book closing. 
  It encourages banks to step up use of Cooperative Credit 
Purchasing Co., a debt-buying entity set up in January 1993, as 
a way to smooth disposal of their nonperforming loans. 
  Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, in a press conference, said 
he hopes these measures will wipe out public concern over the 
eroded financial system, particularly the huge amount of 
nonperforming loans squeezing it.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- Yohei Kono, president of 
the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), voiced 
doubts over an agreement by seven governing parties Tuesday [8 
February] to implement a 6 trillion yen tax cut as a 
pump-priming measure ahead of finding offsetting revenue sources. 
  In a lecture at the party's headquarters, Kono said, "(the 
agreement) is a product of compromise. I don't know whether 
this will have an effective impact on Japan's prolonged business 
slump." 
  Kono said his doubts about the effectiveness of the tax cut 
have been spurred by the row he has seen among the coalition 
partners over the past few days on how to finance the tax cut. 
  Following the agreement, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
told a press conference the government will carry out the 6 
trillion tax cut for 1994. 
  The accord calls for enacting by the end of this year a new 
tax law that will include a clause specifying how the revenue to 
pay for the 6 trillion yen cut is to be raised. 
  Meanwhile, LDP Diet Affairs Committee Chairman Sadatoshi 
Ozato said that while the LDP supports the tax reduction itself, 
the amount is insufficient for pump-priming. 
  Ozato also said it is unclear who will foot the bill for the 
tax cut because the ruling parties held over the decision on how 
it will be funded. 
  Ozato said he cannot believe such a bill will be enacted by 
the end of the year, judging from what he called the weak 
performance of the administration led by Hosokawa.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- Economic Planning Agency 
chief Manae Kubota welcomed the government's decision Tuesday [8 
February] to adopt a 15.25 trillion yen economic relief package, 
saying it raises hopes for a genuine economic recovery. 
Referring to the decision-making process as a "difficult 
delivery," Kubota said she was pleased the plan contains the 
biggest-ever income tax reduction. 
  "I believe we can fully hope for the economy to show a 
genuine recovery from now on," she said. 
  Kubota pointed out the record size of the package, which is 
seen raising the gross national product by a nominal 2.2 percent 
annually. "I feel we have done everything we can," she said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii on Tuesday [8 February] evening voiced confidence that the 
15.25 trillion stimulus package announced the same day will help 
the Japanese economy shift to a stable growth track in fiscal 
1995. 
  The largest-ever package reflects "the best possible effort" 
by the government to turn around the long-ailing economy, Fujii 
told a press conference. 
  Fujii said he can say "with confidence" that the package 
will 
have "great effects" in achieving a full-fledged economic 
recovery in fiscal 1994 and sustainable growth in the following 
year. 
  A combined tax cut of 5.85 trillion yen envisioned in the 
package is likely to spur personal spending, Fujii said. 
  The Japanese economy is showing "steady" signs of recovery, 
Fujii said, citing strong housing-related spending and brisk 
investment in public projects. 
  The latest measures are likely to give further boost to the 
recovery, he said. 
  Fujii said the package contains an administrative guideline 
for the banking industry to solve the problem of bad loans which 
is affecting many banks following the collapse of the "bubble" 
economy. 
  The guideline is intended to reinforce a set of measures 
contained in a preceding guideline which was adopted by the 
Finance Ministry in August 1992, Fujii said. 
  The latest economic package, which is expected to bolster 
not 
only the Japanese economy but the global economy, will probably 
be highly rated by the United States during the coming 
Japan-U.S. summit, Fujii said. 
  He said his ministry has yet to decide on the scale of a 
third supplementary budget to finance the package but it may be 
agreed Thursday.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry will 
notify other government ministries and agencies Thursday [10 
February] afternoon of its austere fiscal 1994 budget proposal 
after getting government approval at an extraordinary cabinet 
session, ministry sources said Tuesday. 
  The general account budget for the year beginning April 1 
will be around 74 trillion yen, 2.5 percent higher than the 
initial budget for fiscal 1993. 
  In order to finance the 5.85 trillion yen cut in income and 
residential taxes decided by the coalition government Tuesday, 
the Finance Ministry will issue deficit-financing bonds for the 
first time in five years. 
  General operating expenditures will grow by only a modest 2 
percent to around 40.6 trillion to 40.7 trillion yen. 
  With the emphasis on reviving the sluggish economy, the 
budget is likely to almost fully provide for the ministries' 
requests concerning public works projects, rising 4.3 percent to 
around 8.9 trillion yen. 
  Defense outlays are expected to grow less than 1 percent 
amid 
the global trend toward cutting down on defense spending. 
  Official development assistance will likely increase around 
4 
percent to the 1 trillion yen scale, roughly unchanged from the 
original budget for fiscal 1993. 
  Tax grants to local governments are expected to be around 
15.5 trillion yen, lower than the amount in the current fiscal 
year. 
  Approximately 2 trillion yen from the Finance Ministry's 
Trust Fund Bureau will be transferred to make up for the 
shortfall, informed sources predict. 
  The budget for servicing outstanding government bonds will 
shrink by 300-400 billion yen to about 15 trillion yen, as low 
interest rates will reduce the payments of bond interest. 
  Tax revenues are expected to total around 58 trillion yen, 
down 4.4 trillion yen from the current year because of the 
implementation of tax reductions. 
  To compensate for the shrinkage, the Finance Ministry is 
planning to earmark approximately 3 trillion yen in nontax 
receipts such as those from the Bank of Japan. 
  If that measure fails to make up for the revenue shortfall, 
the ministry will resort to issuing deficit-financing bonds or 
construction bonds for long-term public investments, the sources 
said. 
  The Japan Development Bank said it will inaugurate a 
financing system to help companies invest in new business areas 
to be created through deregulation. 
  The government-financed bank said the new system will be 
available for local beer brewers, electric appliance recycling 
enterprises, construction of discount goods distribution 
facilities, and enterprises to promote sales of portable 
telephone and international sattelite television program 
receivers. 
  The bank said it will provide about 40 percent of investment 
costs at an annual interest rate of 3.65 percent. 
  The bank is expected to receive applications for loans 
totaling about 100 billion yen, it said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- The government of Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Tuesday [8 February] adopted the 
outline of a medium-term administrative reform program, 
including deregulation in 1,591 areas over the next five years, 
government officials said. 
  The officials said the decision was reached at the inaugural 
session of an administrative reform promotion group presided 
over by Hosokawa. 
  They said the program, based on the goal of total removal of 
regulations, calls for abolishing controls in 866 areas and 
easing them in 725 categories. 
  A total of 160 areas was added to the scope of deregulation 
announced by the government last December, they said. 
  To implement the deregulation, about 60 existing laws have 
to 
be revised, and the government will submit a host of 
law-revising bills to the current session of the Diet for 
approval, they said. 
  The officials said the people will be informed of the 
progress of deregulation through a white paper to be released by 
the government. 
  The deregulation includes an easing of automobile inspection 
requirements and paves the way for small-scale brewers to 
produce local brand beer, the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa departs for Washington on Thursday [10 February] for 
summit talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton, taking with him 
details of a fresh economic stimulus package expected to boost 
Japanese imports. 
  Foreign Ministry officials said the summit, which will be 
the 
third meeting between the two reform-minded leaders, will also 
focus on reviewing the progress of bilateral trade talks and 
coordinating foreign policy objectives. 
  The officials said Hosokawa and Clinton will begin their 
talks Friday morning at the oval office in a small group 
session, including Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and 
U.S. Vice President Al Gore. 
  The two leaders will then have an expanded session of talks 
and a working luncheon, followed by a joint press conference at 
the White House. 
  Hosokawa is expected to brief Clinton on Japan's record-high 
15.25 trillion yen economic stimulus package aimed at spurring 
economic recovery, as well as the country's fiscal 1994 budget 
and third supplementary fiscal 1993 budget. 
  The summit represents the first of four top-level biannual 
reviews of the current series of bilateral trade talks, which 
began last year between deputies of the two leaders on the basis 
of a "framework accord" worked out during Clinton's trip to 
Tokyo in July. 
  Under the accord, the two sides agreed to negotiate measures 
to bring about a "significant increase" of imports into Japan. 
  But the talks have stalled over how to interpret, in terms 
of 
specific measures, the "objective criteria" referred to in the 
framework accord for determining the extent to which foreign 
firms are making inroads into Japan. 
  "We agreed to measure, using objective criteria, either 
numerical or qualitative, achievement in implementation of 
measures introduced," said a Foreign Ministry official. "That 
is what we are doing and the extent to which we can go." 
  "But what the U.S. Government is seeking right now is a 
little bit beyond what we agreed upon," the official said, 
stressing that Japan never agreed to set "numerical targets" for 
imports. 
  Officials said Hosokawa will update Clinton on the various 
political, administrative and economic reforms he has been 
pursuing domestically, considering their global significance. 
  Hosokawa will also speak about the "renewed role to be 
played 
(by Japan) in international society" including its increasing 
participation in U.N. peace restoration efforts, they said. 
  Meanwhile, he will stress the importance of a "global 
partnership" between Japan and the U.S. as two nations that are 
allies, leaders of the world economy, neighbors in the 
Asia-Pacific region and members of the Group of Seven (G-7) 
major industrialized nations, they said. 
  The officials said Hosokawa and Clinton may exchange views 
on 
the situations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, where allied countries may 
soon carry out air strikes to break the siege of Sarajevo, as 
well as North Korea, which faces possible economic sanctions if 
it refuses to open its controversial nuclear facilities for 
international inspections. 
  The U.S. decision on whether to renew most-favored-nation 
(MFN) trading status for China and its recent decision to lift 
its trade embargo on Vietnam will also likely find their way 
onto the agenda, according to the officials, who also mentioned 
the possible topic of policy coordination on Iran. 
  After the summit talks, officials said Hosokawa will deliver 
"a rather major policy speech" later the same day at Georgetown 
University, followed by a question-and-answer session with 
students. 
  On Saturday, Hosokawa will hold a solo press conference and 
visit Arlington National Cemetery for a wreath-laying ceremony 
at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. An official said he may 
also pay his respects at the gravesite of the late President 
John Kennedy, for whom he has "some personal attachment." 
  Hosokawa will leave Washington later Saturday after an 
observation tour at the Children's National Medical Center, 
arriving back in Tokyo on Sunday.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- The Japanese Government 
began selling Californian rice to wholesalers Tuesday [8 
February] at prices some 16 percent lower than the price of 
domestic rice. 
  Sales of rice from Thailand and China are slated to begin 
next Tuesday, with authorities planning to sell a total of 
50,000 tons of the imported grain this month. 
  Japanese consumers should be able to find imported rice on 
the shop shelves for the first time in late February. 
  According to the Food Agency, unblended Californian rice 
will 
be sold to wholesalers for about 17,000 yen per 60-kilogram 
sack, or 16 percent cheaper than the standard price for domestic 
varieties. 
  Japan's domestic rice prices, however, are far higher than 
world market prices. For example, the U.S.-grown Koshihikari 
top-grade rice was retailing in the United States for 1.93 
dollars (208 yen at current exchange rates) per kilogram last 
year, while the equivalent in Japan was being sold at 650 yen a 
kilogram. 
  The imported grain is likely to be initially sold in 
test-size two-kilogram and five-kilogram bags. 
  When supplies of Japanese-grown rice become tight in March, 
imported rice and blends of domestic and foreign grain are 
expected to dominate rice sales. 
  Japan opted to import rice as an emergency measure after a 
poor harvest last year left the nation with a major shortfall of 
its main staple. 
  In December, Japan agreed at global trade talks to partially 
open its rice market, breaking a long-standing policy of barring 
most imports.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- The coalition parties agreed 
Tuesday [8 February] to appropriate funds in the 1994 draft 
budget to buy Patriot surface-to-air missiles and two more 
Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) electronic 
surveillance planes, informed sources said. 
  A policy reversal by the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of 
Japan -- SDPJ] made the decision possible and the sources said 
the items are now likely to be included in the draft budget for 
fiscal 1994 starting in April. 
  The Finance Ministry is scheduled to announce the 1994 draft 
budget plan Thursday. 
  The Defense Agency has pushed for four AWACS planes to boost 
its information gathering capability and has already concluded 
contracts to obtain two from the United States in its 1993 
budget. 
  The AWACS is a surveillance system which uses aircraft with 
radar and sophisticated communications equipment to detect 
airborne and seaborne targets and control weapons systems 
attacking such targets. 
  A single AWACS plane costs 55.4 billion yen but since the 
1994 appropriation is for 550 million yen, the remaining sum 
will be covered by subsequent budgets. 
  The Patriot missiles, which will cost a total of 35.2 
billion 
yen, will boost Japan's capacity to oppose an airborne or 
missile attack. The 1994 budget allocates 140 million yen for 
their purchase. 
  The SDP, which espouses a policy of disarmament, had 
strongly 
opposed the purchase of the AWACS. 
  But since the majority of the coalition favors their 
purchase, the sources said the party's leaders have expressed a 
desire not to further destabilize the coalition at a time when 
it is trying to survive a threat to its existence caused by 
disagreement over a proposed tax reform package. 
  The sources said the SDP has decided instead to push for a 
reduction in the rate of increase in the defense budget compared 
with the previous year's rate. 
  The SDP has also released a statement in which it said it 
will consider the issue of the AWACS and missiles within the 
context of a revision of the overall defense plan. 
  The decision is consistent with the previous Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) government's defense policy, which 
included the purchase of two AWACS planes in the budget for the 
1993 fiscal year as part of the midterm defense buildup program. 
  Despite a cabinet decision in December to approve a cut of 
580 billion yen in the 1991-95 defense buildup program, the 
then-LDP cabinet allowed the agency to proceed with its original 
plan to purchase the AWACS system. 
  The midterm defense buildup program, with a total 
expenditure 
of 22.75 trillion yen, includes provisions for the purchase of 
four AWACS planes.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- Komeito Secretary General 
Yuichi Ichikawa said Tuesday [8 February] Asian nations should 
establish a system of collective security with the United States 
as its center, similar to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
(NATO). 
  Ichikawa expressed the views at a press conference when 
commenting on Japan's existing security system in relation to 
Japan's plan to purchase the U.S.-made Airborne Warning and 
Control System (AWACS). 
  "In Asia, too, I think it would be better to establish an 
axis of collective security equivalent to NATO," Ichikawa said. 
  This is the first reference by Ichikawa to collective 
security, an issue contravening the constitution which renounces 
Japan's use of military force as a means of settling 
international disputes. 
  Ichikawa is known for his close relations with Shinseito co- 
leader Ichiro Ozawa, one of the main strategists of the 
coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Ozawa 
also advocates a cooperative security system in Asia. 
  Komeito, which is a member of the coalition government along 
with six other parties, has recently stepped up criticism of 
Japan's military policy as having a tendency to enjoy peace 
while refusing to help conflict-ridden countries. 
  In 1992, Komeito joined hands with the then-ruling Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) in enacting a Peacekeeping Cooperation 
Law that enabled the Self-Defense Forces to be sent overseas for 
the first time since the end of World War II on U.N. 
peacekeeping missions. 
  "Considering the international situation following the end 
of 
the Cold War, we should discuss at this juncture how far it is 
possible to defend one country alone," Ichikawa said. 
  Noting that NATO works as an military axis in Europe, 
Ichikawa said, "Asia has the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
(APEC) in the field of economy but it does not have a single 
axis in the security field." 
  He proposed creation of a collective security system in Asia 
by integrating APEC and the six-member Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations (ASEAN) as its nucleus and asking the U.S. to join 
in as well.

<F P=106> ["Ill-Boding Moves" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 8 (KCNA) -- The military moves 
of the United States against the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea have assumed greater intensity on and around the Korean 
peninsula. 
  Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today notes the United 
States recently deployed new-type F-16 fighter-bombers on a new 
combat mission at U.S. military bases in Japan and is now 
scheming to bring Patriot missiles and other sophisticated 
military hardware into South Korea. 
  The analyst says: 
  The hardline conservatives are crying that "the United 
States 
cannot avoid a showdown with North Korea." 
  This is a grave military provocation against the DPRK and 
shows that the U.S. policy of overpowering the DPRK with 
strength remains unchanged. 
  The U.S. moves to beef up its forces in Japan are part of 
the "strategy of forward deployment" aimed at hurling its huge 
forces into the Korean peninsula without difficulties in "the 
event of contingency". 
  On the other hand, the United States is planning to stage 
the 
"Team Spirit" joint military exercises against the DPRK under 
another name or in another place, if necessary, breaking its 
promise to refrain from using nuclear weapons and any other 
armed force and threatening the DPRK with them. 
  It is also intensifying ideological offensive in a bid to 
disintegrate the DPRK from within. The U.S. plan to set up 
"Radio Free Asia" is part of such moves. The United States 
employs smiling diplomacy at the negotiating table, as if it 
were interested in peace, and tries hard to isolate and stifle 
its dialogue partner behind the scene. This is really the 
height of duplicity and impudence. 
  The United States must know well of the opposite side.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Excerpt] The announcement by President Bill Clinton that 
the United States has decided to withdraw its embargo against 
Vietnam is most welcome. It has been hailed by many as a move 
that will be good for America, good for Vietnam, and good for 
the international community. 
  Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed has described 
the U.S. position as good news, adding that it will help Vietnam 
grow and prosper. And indeed it will as inflow of foreign 
investments into Vietnam, especially by American businessmen, 
will become a key factor in restructuring and boosting the 
country's economy. 
  The lifting of the embargo, imposed three decades ago, has 
been long overdue. In the United States, it has been a delicate 
issue because the Vietnam War had taken a heavy toll on the 
American servicemen's lives -- 61,000 in all -- and there are 
some 2,238 soldiers listed as missing or (?counted) as prisoners 
of war. 
  The U.S. President has said that he has made the move to 
lift 
the embargo not for economics, but because he thought it was the 
best way to get the fullest possible accounting of those 
missing, referred to as MIA. Whatever the reasons, it is a 
wise, bold, and pragmatic move despite the fact that there may 
be many Americans who are opposed to the measure. But it is the 
first step toward normalization of relations between the two 
countries. It is good that Vietnam has plenty to gain from the 
lifting of the embargo. Even when embargo was in place, Vietnam 
achieved a 7.5-percent economic growth. Now with the embargo 
lifted, the country's economy is expected to grow by more than 
10 percent this year. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Philippines will continue to maintain its claim 
on Sabah. This was Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo's 
reaction to Senator Arturo Tolentino's pronouncement that the 
country has renounced its claim to Sabah, which was relayed by 
the president to Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamed: 
  [Begin Tolentino recording in progress, in English] ...it's 
on border problems with the Philippines. Formerly, Mr. Mahathir 
said that unless the Sabah claim is dropped, he would not step 
again on Philippine soil. And he would not negotiate any 
treaties such as border agreements unless the Sabah claim is 
dropped. Now he has come here. He seems to be a very happy man 
and even went to the extent of giving a gift of an automobile to 
our president in exchange of a Timex watch. This means that he 
is very happy now, and the only explanation for his satisfaction 
is that the Sabah irritant has already been withdrawn. [end 
recording] 
  Romulo said, however, that this is not true and that the 
government has no intention of giving up its claim to Sabah. 
Romulo added that the Malaysian Government is ready to help the 
Sultan of Sulu's heirs with their territorial claim. [sentence 
as heard] 
  [Begin Romulo recording, in English] I believe that was 
brought up in the context of a conversation of the president 
with Dr. Mahathir. I cannot give you any further enlightenment 
on that. I assure you that there is no agreement on Sabah at 
this point in time. It was more the desire of the president to 
help the heirs of Sabah above and beyond the nominal rental that 
is being paid now. [end recording]

  [Text] A high-ranking official from the North Korean UN 
mission said today that North Korea does not want a war to break 
out on the Korean peninsula over the nuclear issue. The 
official stressed that North Korea has been very patient with 
the nuclear issue but that North Korea will not shrink but be 
resolute [turyoum opsi tangdanghage taehalkosirago] because its 
existence is at stake. 
  The official from the North Korean UN mission, however, 
warned that if a war should break out, it will not be a 
repetition of the Gulf war situation in which Iraq suffered. 
  In connection with the UN sanctions, the official said that 
although North Korea is having difficulties [pirok oryopkinun 
hana], it has been living without help from the United States, 
Japan, and Russia, and warned that even a worm resists when 
trampled upon. He did not make a negative statement about 
China, supporting the speculation that North Korea has had close 
contacts with Beijing over the nuclear issue. 
  The official said that he has no knowledge of the reported 
possibility of a behind-the-scenes contact between the United 
States and North Korea this week prior to the International 
Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors meeting.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- The Social Democratic Party 
has accepted a compromise to enact by the year-end a bill 
designed to finance a 6 trillion yen tax cut that is the core of 
a 15 trillion yen pump-priming package, party officials said 
Tuesday [8 February]. The decision by the largest party in the 
ruling coalition paves the way for Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa to announce a fresh tax reform plan, ending a nearly 
weeklong dispute over a new indirect tax that almost caused the 
breakup of his six-month coalition cabinet. 
  Five coalition leaders resumed talks at 10:30 A.M. Tuesday 
in 
a bid to settle the tax dispute. 
  Hosokawa vowed late Monday night to settle the rift in the 
governing coalition over funding details for the tax cut. 
  On Monday, representatives of the coalition parties agreed 
to 
implement the 6 trillion yen tax cut independently and establish 
a consultative body among coalition parties to decide funding 
details within a year, coalition officials said. 
  Coalition leaders agreed to scrap Hosokawa's original plan 
to 
replace the 3 percent consumption tax with a 7 percent "national 
welfare tax" in April 1997. 
  Officials said the Hosokawa cabinet will unveil the economic 
stimulus package Tuesday evening after settling the tax dispute. 
  The five coalition leaders who resumed the talks were 
Shinseito co-leader Ichiro Ozawa, SDP Secretary General Wataru 
Kubo, Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa, Democratic 
Socialist Party Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa, and Hiroyuki 
Sonoda, who represents an alliance of Hosokawa's Japan New Party 
and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura's Sakigake 
(Harbinger). 
  At an early morning news conference on February 3, Hosokawa 
announced the 6 trillion yen tax cut retroactive to January 1 
and also proposed imposing the 7 percent welfare tax to offset 
resultant revenue shortfalls. But the plan drew strong 
criticism from the SDP, which threatened to quit the coalition 
unless the new tax was dropped.

  The Nepalese paper DRISTI February 2 noted the United States

always bringing the military importance into relief. 
  The "nuclear issue" of the DPRK is, in fact, a lie and its 
settlement can be found only through dialogue and talks, the 
paper said. 
  The Yemeni paper AL-RA'Y AL-'AM said the nuclear capability 
of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea poses really no 
threat. The big threat to that country is actually the U.S. 
nuclear weapons deployed in South Korea, it added.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 8 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
puppet foreign minister, Han Sung-chu, at "a meeting of heads of 
embassies and legations abroad" on February 5 charged the North 
again with the non-existent "nuclear problem" and cried for "a 
stern measure" against the North, according to a radio report 
from Seoul. 
  His bellicose remarks were a dangerous provocation bringing 
the situation of the Korean peninsula to the brink of war. 
  When the process of a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue 
on the Korean peninsula has been driven to a fatally blind alley 
by the U.S. perfidious act, the South Korean puppet clique is 
showing feverish activities to bar the third-stage talks between 
the DPRK and the United States and touch off a nuclear war in 
league with outside forces. 
  Han Sung-chu also paid a lip-service to "dialogue." But this 
was nothing but a sophism for covering up the anti-national, 
anti-peace and anti-reunification criminal acts of the puppet 
clique which is driving the situation of the peninsula to the 
brink of war. 
  Crying for "dialogue" while brandishing the sword is 
virtually an insult to dialogue and its total negation. 
  The South Korean puppet clique is trying to isolate and 
stifle the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with the help 
of outside forces, clean indifferent to North-South dialogue. 
This invariable intention of the puppets was made clearer when 
Han Sung-chu stated that to take "a stern measure" was their 
"consistent position." 
  The South Korean rulers must clearly look at the will and 
resolution of our people and act with discretion. Their 
reckless new war provocation moves will bring them to 
destruction. 
  The puppet clique must unconditionally renounce the 
anachronistic moves of North-South confrontation.

  [Text] U.S. Trade Representative [USRT] Mickey Kantor 
returend to the United States on the evening of 4 February after 
holding separate talks with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and 
Posts and Telecommunications Minister Takenori Kanzaki in 
succession and exchanging views on new Japan-U.S. economic 
talks. After arriving in Japan on 1 February, he met with Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, and 
other officials and tried to seek a way out of the deadlocked 
economic talks by means of a "political decision." However, no 
progress was made and it seems that the remarks Kantor made 
while he was in Japan made Japanese officials distrustful of him. 
  At the 2 February meeting with Foreign Minister Hata, Kantor 
touched on the issue of objective criteria and repeatedly said 
seven or eight times that "the United States will review its 
ties with Japan if Japan does not accept (the U.S. demands)." 
In response, Foreign Minister Hata said that "we cannot 
negotiate under this kind of threat." Reportedly, sharp words 
were exchanged between them. 
  Because of this, some officials say that "USTR Kantor 
achieved nothing but fueled the confrontation between the two 
countries," (according to a senior official of the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry).

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan and the United States Should Aim at </F>
Expanded Equilibrium and Work for a Trade Agreement"] 
  [Text] The economic framework talks are still deadlocked 
even with the Japan-U.S. summit meeting close at hand. If Japan 
and the United States collide, not only will both nations be 
losers in a trade war, but the post-Cold War world economy will 
also fall into confusion. There is no other way but for both 
countries to look at the problem from a global viewpoint, aim at 
expanded equilibrium, and seek a solution to the impasse. 
  U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Mickey Kantor, who came to 
Japan amid the political confusion within the Hosokawa 
administration caused by the economic stimulation plan, stated 
before he left for home that "If we see no actual results, we 
might have to consider other options." He indicated the 
possibility of sanctions against Japan. Kantor thought that 
stubborn Japanese bureaucrats were obstructing any progress in 
the framework talks, and he attempted to effect a breakthrough 
through political consultations with Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata, and Minister of International Trade and Industry Hiroshi 
Kumagai. However, he did not succeed. 
  The United States demands the setting of numerical targets 
to 
promote market opening in automobiles and auto parts, insurance, 
and government procurement. In response, Japan firmly maintains 
its position of rejecting such numerical targets. 
  It is common sense in world economics that the setting of 
numerical targets will lead to "managed trade." Last fall, a 
group of key U.S. economists, including Nobel Prize awardees, 
issued a statement urging Japan to say "no" to U.S. demands. 
Recently, a group of Japanese economists also suggested that 
"numerical targets will promote government-guided managed trade, 
and constitute a basis for the theory of Japanese heresy [nihon 
ishitsu ron]." 
  Numerical targets also run counter to the Hosokawa 
administration's goal of economic system reform. Furthermore, 
if Japan-U.S. trade, which ought to serve as the model in world 
trade, were to be managed by the government, this would negate 
the principles of free trade. In the final phase of the 
framework talks, Japan and the United States should reaffirm the 
principles of free trade, more than anything else. 
  Nevertheless, it will not be good for the arguments between 
the two countries to just continue to go round and round in 
circles. Due to the gap in economic conditions, there is a 
strong possibility that the bilateral trade imbalance will 
expand even further. While the Japanese Government has indeed 
worked on liberalizing its market, we can hardly say the 
Japanese market is sufficiently open. As a nation enjoying a 
huge trade surplus, Japan should strive, at least, to avoid 
accusations that its market is closed. 
  A number of U.S. negotiators lamented that "it is like 
talking to the wall." Japanese negotiators should not only 
argue back at U.S. demands, but should also heed the call for 
market liberalization humbly. 
  Japan should come up with market opening proposals in each 
sector to the extent of not involving any numerical targets. 
For instance, a framework for private sector consultations 
between Japanese and U.S. automobile makers on marketing, parts 
supply, environmental measures, and so forth can be established. 
  Economic stimulation measures to break out of the recession 
also hold the key to negotiations with the United States. 
Measures to expand domestic demand, such as a large-scale 
income tax reduction, can do much to expand the world economy 
and correct the trade imbalance. It is high time for the 
Hosokawa administration to decide on bold pump-priming measures 
as the trump card to correct the imbalance between Japan and 
foreign countries. 
  If Japan is unable to open its market, and unable to come up 
with economic stimulation measures, thus leading to an expansion 
in the trade imbalance, this will only aggravate the pressure to 
appreciate the yen. This may also bring about legislation in 
the U.S. Congress calling for retaliation against Japan.

  [Text] With the 11 February Japan-U.S. summit near at 
hand, a senior Foreign Ministry official commented on the 
outlook for the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, which will 
become the focal point of the upcoming summit. On 7 February, 
the official stated: "The atmosphere surrounding the ongoing 
economic framework talks will be greatly changed depending on 
whether Japan can indicate its macroeconomic policies during the 
upcoming summit meeting." Thus, he expressed concern over the 
situation in which the government and the ruling parties are 
facing difficulties in working out plans to implement income tax 
cuts. 
  Moreover, in view of the worsening situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the deadlocked talks between the DPRK 
(North Korea) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
over the former's suspected nuclear program, the official 
indicated: "At the summit meeting, measures to deal with the 
former Yugoslavia and North Korea issues will be discussed in 
addition to the economic framework talks."

  [Text] In relation to the U.S.'s lifting the economic 
sanctions against Vietnam, Japanese enterprises foresee "the 
possibility of entering joint partnerships with U.S. enterprises 
and of exporting [products produced in Vietnam] to the United 
States, and broader chances for investment." Up to now, many 
Japanese enterprises have been cautious about large-scale 
investment in Vietnam, but this year saw the start of full-scale 
international assistance including that provided by the Japanese 
Government which forecast that Japan's activities in Vietnam 
will be accelerated. 
  Vietnam fever among Japanese enterprises has gained 
increased 
momentum in recent days. Every day more than 1,000 Japanese 
visited the JETRO [Japan External Trade Organization] sponsored 
"Vietnam Exhibit" which was held in Tokyo in the latter part of 
January. In March, a "Japan Industrial Sample Fair" is 
scheduled to open in Hanoi, to be participated in by more than 
100 Japanese machinery manufacturers. In April, a Keidanren 
[Japan Federation of Economic Organizations] delegation will 
visit Ho Chi Minh City to hold the second Japan-Vietnam joint 
economic conference. 
  Investments by Japanese enterprises started in the late 
1980's, centered around such small-scale operations as 
manufacturing textiles and home electric appliances. Since last 
year, however, heavy and chemical industries started to set up 
joint venture plants. Scheduled to be built are a minibus 
factory by Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, cement plants by Nihon 
Cement Co. Ltd. and Mitsubishi Materials Corporation, and a 
vinyl chloride plant by Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals Inc. is under 
consideration. 
  In addition to these, electrical and automobile 
manufacturing 
companies are placing emphasis on exports to Vietnam by opening 
offices there for sales and service. 
  The lifting of the U.S. trade embargo will enable Japanese 
enterprises which build plants in Vietnam to import parts and 
raw materials from the United States or to export their products 
to the United States. No restrictions will be imposed in 
financing funds and settling accounts in U.S. dollars. 
Furthermore, opportunities are available for Japanese to launch 
large-scale development of resources and to consolidate social 
infrastructure by entering joint partnerships with U.S. 
enterprises equipped with technical knowhow, and abounding with 
financial resources. The U.S. decision is likely to encourage 
activities of Japanese enterprises in Vietnam. 
  In the development of petroleum resources, three Japanese 
firms in partnership with Mobil Corporation of the U.S. have 
obtained the rights and interests to submarine oil fields. As 
part of Official Development Assistance [ODA], Japan decided to 
provide loans in the amount of 52.3 billion yen for eight 
projects which aim at improving such social infrastructure as 
power plants and railroads. U.S. enterprises are expected to 
make bids in international bidding, heightening competition for 
Japanese enterprises. Also it is likely that Japanese and U.S. 
firms will make joint bids. 
  Japanese enterprises, taking notice of a Vietnamese 
population of 70 million and abundant mineral resources, regard 
Vietnam as the most promising market next to China. However, 
Vietnam lacked social infrastructure and legal systems, and the 
U.S. trade embargo imposed obstacles, both material and moral. 
Morihito Kosuda, Nissho Iwai Corporation's representative in 
Indochina, set a high value on the U.S. measure "which is highly 
effective because Japanese businessmen can rid themselves of the 
psychological restraint to refrain from investing." Nissho Iwai 
will increase the number of staff members in Vietnam from 11 to 
21, and major trading firms plan to follow suit.

  [Text] Japanese business circles have highly praised the 4 
February U.S. decision to completely lift economic sanctions it 
previously imposed on the SRV, saying that "we should extend 
open arms to welcome it" (as stated by Akira Nishio, president 
of Nissho Iwai Corporation and chairman of the Japan-Vietnam 
Economic Committee under the Federation of Economic 
Organizations of Japan [Keidanren]). There are strong hopes 
that full-scale business operations in the SRV by U.S. firms 
"would help expand economic aid programs to the SRV, such as by 
the IMF, and help vitalize its market" (as stated by a Japan 
External Trade Organization official). This would also help 
diminish investment risks. Japanese businessmen thus welcome 
this latest U.S. move. 
  Presuming that sanctions would be lifted, about 30 major 
U.S. 
businesses, including IBM Corporation and Coca Cola Enterprises 
Incorporated, have already made preparations to advance into the 
SRV market. For example, they have set up local branch offices 
staffed by their employees. Among Japanese firms, Nissho Iwai 
Corporation has worked things out "to the point where operations 
can begin immediately" regarding tie-ups with U.S. firms. For 
example, it embarked on a joint project last December to probe 
off-shore SRV oil fields with Mobil Corporation, a U.S. oil 
major, and other firms. 
  Last year, Japanese trade with the SRV increased about 23 
percent over the previous year to $1.6 billion. There is high 
Japanese business interest in the SRV since, among other 
reasons, yen appreciation has forced firms to search for cheap 
labor. 
  After the end of the Vietnam war, Japanese firms resumed 
trade with the SRV in the early stages. They are said to be 
ahead of U.S. firms by seven years. For this reason, U.S. firms 
are deeply concerned about their "having made a late start." 
Thus, it is expected there will now be fierce competition 
between Japanese and U.S. firms.

  [Text] The "Tripolar Forum for North Pacific Security," 
which was held in a Tokyo hotel (under the auspices of the Japan 
Institute for International Issues), ended 2 February. It was 
attended by concerned government and private representatives of 
three countries; Japan, the United States, and Russia. 
  During discussions, which were held for two days, the United 
States and Russia proposed that joint military exercises among 
Japan, the United States, and Russia in north Pacific regions be 
carried out. Japan disapproved the proposal, citing, among 
other things, that: 1) the forum's purpose is not to counteract 
other nations except the three countries; and 2) there are 
things needed to be done first, including fostering trust. 
  At the forum, the participants agreed that it is definitely 
important for Russian reform efforts to take root for stability 
in the region.

  [Text] It was learned on 4 February that Colonel General 
Andrey Nikolayev, commander of the Russian Border Security 
Force, in an unofficial visit to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
[MOFA], asked the Japanese Government to take appropriration 
actions against Japanese boats engaging in "illegal fishing 
operations" around the northern territorial islands. 
  According to an official concerned, Commander Nikolayev 
visited the MOFA on 3 February to meet with officials of the 
MOFA and the Maritime Safety Agency. At the meeting, he warned 
that Russia will take measures to ban Japanese boats from 
fishing in Russian waters in the future, saying: "Such acts 
cannot be tolerated because it is a violation of Russian 
borders." The MOFA insisted there was no problem because these 
northern territories are Japan's territories. But the Russian 
commander said emphatically: "No peace treaty has been concluded 
with Japan yet, and Russia's borders with Japan are existing 
facts."

  [Text] A government source disclosed on 5 February that, 
in connection with the issue of Russian dumping of radioactive 
wastes in the Sea of Japan, the government has firmed its plan 
to provide financial support to Russia for a project to build 
new simplified on-land disposal facilities. The government 
plans to send a fact- finding mission to Russia shortly to work 
out details. 
  Hoping to prevent further dumping of nuclear wastes at sea, 
the government had originally proposed to Russia that it would 
supply a Panamanian-registered chemical tanker (with 
displacement of 6,800 tons). 
  However, Russia rejected the offer in mid-January, pointing 
out that "the tanker cannot operate in frozen waters because the 
outer walls of its hull are too thin." Instead, Russia has 
indicated its intention to tentatively store radioactive wastes 
in its own tanker built exclusively for this purpose. In 
addition, it has revealed a plan to construct simplified 
disposal facilities for handling liquid radioactive wastes in 
Vladivostok and has asked Japan to provide financial support for 
this project. 
  In this connection, the Japanese Government, after careful 
review, has decided to extend several hundred million yen in 
financial assistance to help fund construction of a filtering 
device which is to become the core of the disposal facilities. 
The government plans to allocate funds for the project from a 
$100- million fund designated for dismantling nuclear weapons 
possessed by former Soviet states.

<F P=106> [Report by Beijing correspondent Moriyasu Okazaki] </F>
  [Text] It has been learned that China wants Japan to make 
the construction of a bullet train system between Beijing and 
Shanghai a key project in the next yen-based loans that will 
begin in 1996. During a recent visit to China by Tsutomu Hata, 
deputy prime minister and foreign minister, the two countries 
agreed to carry out a symbolic project of Japanese-Chinese 
cooperative relations, and this project could be a suitable 
project for fulfilling that agreement. But France and Germany 
are reported to be pulling ahead of Japan in selling the 
high-speed railway project to China. If China decides to adopt 
France's TGV [le train de grande vitesse -- high-speed train] 
system but to use yen-based loans, this will pose a difficult 
problem for Japan. 
  The plan for the high-speed railway system envisages 
constructing an elevated railway 1,330 km long. Its train should 
be able to run at a maximum speed of 250 km an hour, thus 
reducing the travel time between Beijing and Shanghai to six to 
seven hours from the current 17 hours. The construction project 
will cost 800 billion to 1 trillion yen. A source familiar with 
Japanese-Chinese relations said that China has only presented an 
unofficial list of yen-based loan projects, and that the 
high-speed railway construction project is on this list. 
  A problem is that Japan is considered to be behind other 
competitors in this project. The Chinese newspaper CHINA DAILY 
has reported that competition for it is intense and that France 
and Germany are ahead of other competitors. Because the 
yen-based loans are untied and are provided without strings 
attached, Japan in principle cannot complain even if China 
decides to build a French bullet train system using funds 
provided by Japan. But in Japan, there are people asking why it 
should provide huge yen-based loans to China, which is 
continuing its rapid economic growth, when Japan's own economy 
is experiencing a serious situation. Usually, the yen-based 
loan plan is prepared for a five- to six-year period. This time, 
however, Japan will prepare the new yen-based loan plan for a 
two- to three-year period, no doubt out of a desire to make the 
amount of financial assistance look smaller this way. 
  But, in view of the principle of economical cooperation, 
there is no way for Japan to openly ask China to choose the 
Japanese bullet train system. It is possible to use a "clever 
move." For example, if Japan extends China technological 
cooperation from the stage of carrying out an economic 
feasibility study, this will mean carrying out the study using 
the specifications of the Japanese bullet train system, which in 
turn may lead to China's eventually choosing the Japanese 
system. In any case, Japan has no choice but to keep its 
fingers crossed. Depending on how one looks at it, this can be 
a good opportunity for Japan to roll back the competition. But, 
it is likely to be an issue which will cause some headaches.

  [Text] It was learned on 1 February that the government 
has formulated a draft action program for government procurement 
in response to foreign criticism that Japan's current procedures 
for the government procurement lack transparency. The draft 
action program calls for: 1) making it a principle for the 
government to procure goods through open competitive contracts; 
2) lowering the size of government procurement subject to public 
announcement from the current amount of 1 million SDRs (the 
IMF's special drawing right and approximately 162 million yen) 
to 0.8 million SDRs (approximately 130 million yen) and 
expanding opportunities for foreign firms to obtain information 
on the government procurement; and 3) making all goods subject 
to the current complaint-addressing procedure in order for 
foreign companies to file their complaints with the government 
about its procurement. 
  The government, which will formally decide on the draft 
action program at a cabinet meeting on 4 February, plans to 
brief the U.S. side on the draft action program at the 
Japan-U.S. summit talks on 11 February. Both Japan and the 
United States have been locked in a sharp confrontation in their 
negotiations on the government procurement under the Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks. The government intends to break the 
deadlock in the negotiations by describing the action program as 
a "declaration of the Japanese market opening in the government 
procurement sector," (says a Foreign Ministry source). 
  The draft action program calls for making it a principle for 
the government to procure goods through open competitive 
contracts which allow foreign firms to bid for contracts out of 
consideration to U.S. complaint that "Japan's free (individual) 
contracts shut foreign firms out of biddings for the contracts." 
The draft action program explicitly calls for cutting the number 
of free contracts that are concluded between the government and 
the government- designated individual enterprise. The draft 
action program also calls for the need to raise the transparency 
in the government procurement by announcing the government's 
procurement plans beforehand in the Official Gazette even if the 
government inevitably concludes free contracts. 
  In the government procurement of computers in which the U.S. 
companies are greatly interested, the draft action program calls 
for adopting a general assessment formula under which the 
performance of computers is assessed as a criteria for 
procurement judgment in addition to the current tender formula 
under which contracts go to under-bidders [saiteikakaku 
rakusatsuhoshiki]. 
  As for large-scale government procurement, the government 
has 
made public its plans for the procurement of goods worth more 
than 1 million SDRs once in January every year since 1991, but 
the draft action program calls for holding down the amount to 
more than 0.8 million SDRs. For foreign firms which are eager to 
bid for contracts but have no detailed knowledge of the 
government procurement, this step will promote their market 
access by helping them gain more and quick information on the 
government procurement. 
  As part of freedom of information efforts, the government 
intends to increase the transparency of its procurement by 
releasing an annual report (white paper) on the government 
procurement. 
  In addition, the government plans to expand the application 
of the current procedure to address foreign complaints about the 
government procurement of computers to all other goods. As part 
of steps to prevent a recurrence of bid riggings, the government 
plans to ask the Fair Trade Commission to set a guideline on 
biddings for the government procurement and deal sternly with 
illegal practices.

  [Text] In order to expand its procurement of foreign-made 
equipment, Tokyo Electric Co., Ltd. [TEC] will introduce a 
system of international bidding for procuring large 
general-purpose equipment, including hydraulic power generators. 
As the first step, TEC will invite European companies to join 
in an international bid to be held in the near future to procure 
a water turbine for one of its generators. TEC has so far held 
international bidding only for procuring high-tech equipment 
such as nuclear reactors, or for general-purpose equipment such 
as transmission lines which would require only a small amount of 
funds. TEC is expected to place constant orders for equipment 
-- such as hydraulic power generation equipment which requires 
relatively large amounts of funds. If the international bidding 
for this procurement should be expanded, it would be useful in 
easing the demand by the United States and European countries to 
open the Japanese market. 
  TEC plans to place an order for a water turbine for one of 
its generator to replace the obsolete turbine at Yukawa 
Hydraulic Power Station (in Nagano), and also to increase its 
generating capability to 18,000 kilowatt-hours. Prior to the 
bidding, in late January four Japanese companies and three 
European manufacturers -- including Hitachi Ltd. and Toshiba 
Corporation as well as GEC Arstaum-Nelpick of France, 
Fest-Alpine of Austria, and Surdzer- Eshawis of Switzerland 
[names as published] respectively -- were entrusted with 
estimations. 
  Various European countries have criticized Japanese electric 
power companies for favoring mostly American companies such as 
General Electric (GE) as far as international biddings are 
conducted. European companies are known for high technological 
standards in manufacturing hydraulic power generators. TEC has 
judged that with the participation of the three European 
companies in this bidding, various European countries will 
become less dissatisfied. 
  A water turbine costs hundreds of million in yen. However, 
in addition to turbine used at the Yukawa Hydraulic Station, TEC 
still has many hydraulic power stations whose turbines have to 
be replaced. Therefore, it is expected that a considerable 
number of orders for water turbines will be placed in the 
future. If TEC should succeed in the current order, the company 
intends to invite more foreign companies to join in the bidding 
for large machines such as thermal power generators.

  [Text] The government is racking its brains over its deep 
concern of the emergence of an argument in Europe and the United 
States regarding "Japan's nuclear armament" in connection with 
the issue of suspected nuclear development in the DPRK (North 
Korea). In some quarters of the government, officials initially 
laughed it off, saying: "It is absolutely ridiculous." However, 
references to this issue have been made by U.S. Government 
authorities. To prevent this issue from arousing any 
unnecessary feelings of apprehension among neighboring Asian 
countries, growing concerns have been voiced suggesting that 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, himself, for that matter, take 
the opportunity to clearly defend Japan's position on this issue 
during such occasions as the Japan- U.S. summit meeting 
scheduled for 11 February. 
  Analyzing the issue, one Japanese-U.S. diplomatic source 
notes the following points: 1) there is an ulterior motive 
behind this; 2) spreading rumors that Japan has nuclear 
capabilities could be used as an advantage in breaking the 
stalled DPRK nuclear issue; and 3) this signifies the collapse 
of the Japanese-U.S. security structure, proving that the U.S. 
military has weakened. However, a top Foreign Ministry official 
argues: "To use this as a whip against North Korea is a 
completely mistaken notion. We are very annoyed." But what 
makes the issue so complicated is that "there exists the idea in 
Europe and the United States that nuclear weapons should be 
countered by nuclear weapons, and it is impossible no matter how 
hard Japan, which has experienced a nuclear attack, tries to 
make them understand its almost allergic reaction to nuclear 
weapons; it is almost like playing a game of "whack-a-mole" [a 
game in which the object is to keep hitting mechanical moles 
which randomly pop out from their holes]" (as stated by a senior 
Foreign Ministry official). 
  In some quarters of the government, officials hope for an 
early settlement of the DPRK nuclear issue which is at the core 
of Japan's new problem. However, to wipe out this argument on 
Japanese nuclear armament, they plan to work harder to try to 
persuade U.S. Congressmen to understand Japan's position before 
Hosokawa's U.S. visit.

Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ], against a plan to appropriate funds in the draft budget 
for the next fiscal year for the procurement of Airborne Warning

  He was speaking at a news conference held the same day at 
Hyakuri Air Self-Defense Force Base. Aichi stated: "The

  [Text] In the morning of 3 February, Defense Agency [DA] 
Director General Kazuo Aichi met with Prime Minister Hosokawa at 
the prime minister's official residence. Regarding the expense 
in purchasing an airborne warning and control system (AWACS), 
which the DA is demanding to be included in a budget for fiscal 
1994, Aichi pointed out, among other things, the need to give 
consideration to Japan-U.S. relations. He demanded that the 
expenses be included in the budget, saying: "I want the 
expenses to be approved when the Finance Ministry's draft budget 
will be unofficially announced. The ministry is scheduled to do 
that on 10 February prior to your trip to the United States."

  [Text] On 1 February, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
informally decided on members of an advisory panel to be set up 
for revising "the National Defense Program Outline." As an 
advisory council directly under the prime minister, the panel 
will consist of nine members, including former administrative 
officials, business leaders, and experienced scholars. Asahi 
Breweries Corp. Chairman Hirotaro Higuchi is expected to chair 
the panel. The decision on panel members will be officially 
made following the compilation of the fiscal 1994 budget; and 
then, the panel will be inaugurated as early as late February 
with its administrative office at the Cabinet Security Affairs 
Office. Regarding Japan's defense strategy in this post-Cold 
War era, the panel is expected to work out a report which will 
become the framework for the new "Outline" before guidelines for 
the fiscal 1995 estimate budget requests are decided in August. 
  In responding to a strong request from business circles, 
Hosokawa finally agreed to appointing Higuchi as chairman. 
Moreover, what is noteworthy in this informal list is Makoto 
Sakuma, former Joint Staff Council chairman and current adviser 
to the Defense Agency [DA]. The DA recommended Sakuma and he 
will be the first former Self-Defense Force [SDF] senior 
official to participate in the panel. 
  It was decided in September 1993, shortly after the 
coalition 
government came into power, that the panel on revising defense 
policy should be set up. The DA, which first proposed the need 
for such a panel, has worked out a list of candidates and the 
prime minister has informally agreed to this list. However, 
Hosokawa will call DA Director General Kazuo Aichi and DA 
Administrative Vice Minister Shigeru Hatakeyama to his official 
residence for final coordination. Thus, depending on the 
results of the coordination, the decision on the list may remain 
in a state of fluidity. 
  What is noteworthy is the fact that experts specializing in 
defense issues, except former DA and SDF officials, have been 
deliberately excluded from the list. It is said that panel 
members are selected on the basis that they are "intellectuals 
capable of discussing wide-ranged defense issues from an 
international viewpoint," (as stated by a DA source). However, 
judging from the selection list, panel discussions will 
certainly become DA-oriented. 
  In addition to Higuchi and Sakuma, others who have been 
informally selected as panel members are: (names listed in the 
order of the kana syllabary) Yoshio Okawara, former ambassador 
to the United States and current Keidanren [the Japan Federation 
of Economic Organizations] adviser; Toyoo Gyoten, former deputy 
vice minister for financial affairs and current Tokyo Bank 
governor; Hiroshi Saito, Keidanren vice chairman and chairman of 
Nippon Steel Ltd.; Seiki Nishihiro, former DA administrative 
vice minister; Shinji Fukukawa, vice chairman of Kobe Steel 
Corp. and former administrative vice minister of the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry; Ken Moroi, vice president of 
the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations and chairman of 
Chichibu Cement Corp.; and Akio Watanabe, professor of Aoyama 
Gakuin University and formerly professor of Tokyo University.

Secrets Obtained: Coalition Camp Prediction on Election; 
Election Results in the 274 Single-Seat Districts Throughout 
Japan Will Turn Out This Way!"] 
  [Text] Contests in the political world are decided by 
judging the future. The political reform bills which are based 
on reform of the election system had only just begun to be 
deliberated in the upper house, but the coalition government 
camp had begun work on making a list of prospective candidates 
in the single-seat election districts, and anticipating the 
election results. Among the candidates backed by the coalition 
of the ruling parties are listed even the names of incumbent LDP 
Diet members, and Diet members who will be urged to "switch 
sides" are also revealed. Within this is concealed a 
level-headed, shrewd calculation which foresees a 
re-restructuring of political circles.

Notes: The predicted number of Diet seats for each party was computed 
centered on those who were certain to win (@), those who had a good chance 
of winning (0), and also considering candidates whose chance of winning 
depends on the situation in the election district (#--slight chance, 
*--almost no chance). The "Other" of the candidates backed by the coalition 
governing parties includes such persons as those who are not at present 
members of the coalition government parties, but who will become candidates 
backed by the coalition government parties at the time of the election. The 
"Other" of the opposition parties are such persons as independents linked 
to the LDP. 


<H5>  Even Formation at One Stroke of a New Unified Party </H5>
  Even if the political reform bills on which deliberation has 
begun in the upper house were to be passed in the current Diet 
session, the work of dividing into single-seat election 
districts would not be settled until about next summer. But 
predicting the division of the new districts is not difficult 
for an election professional. And the "fitting (into election 
districts)" of candidates based on the division of districts is 
already progressing steadily behind the scenes. 
  One cannot do the "fitting" unless one grasps the trend of 
opposing candidates, not to mention the votes received in the 
past by candidates on the government-party side based on the 
division of districts and the analysis of vote-gathering 
organizations. It is no exaggeration to say that this ability to 
collect information before the fact makes the difference between 
victory and defeat. This table of predictions was made by 
executives of the coalition governing parties, based on 
information from every party, as material for the purpose of 
advancing as quickly as possible the coordination of candidates 
within the coalition governing parties. 
  The system of single-seat election districts is advantageous 
to large political parties. If the current coalition governing 
parties were to each field their own candidates without 
cooperating in the election, there would be no doubt of a strong 
victory by the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] in virtually every 
election district. If the coalition camp also desires to survive 
after reform of the election system, it has no choice but to 
merge and form a new party, or to narrow down to a single 
candidate by coordinating candidates among a number of parties. 
Even if it does not go so far as to form a new unified party at 
one stroke, the building, as soon as possible, of a system of 
election cooperation which has a re-restructuring of political 
circles in view is a question of life or death for the coalition 
government parties. 
  That is, the election situation summarized in the prediction 
table not only constitutes reference material for devising the 
governing parties' election strategy and reconstruction 
strategy, it also constitutes material for persuasion when 
urging candidates of other parties to switch sides.

<H3>  "It Is Painful for the Social Democratic Party of Japan, But 
It Is an Accurate Reading" </H3>
  Incidentally, what one notices as soon as one looks at the 
table is that even though the parties in the same coalition 
government, members of Sakigake [Harbinger] and the left 
faction of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] have not 
been made coalition-backed candidates. Sakigake is forming a 
unified group with the Japan New Party, and both Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Takemura and Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Hatoyama, 
who guard Prime Minister Hosokawa's flanks, are from Sakigake. 
But it has been rumored more than once that they are not on good 
terms with the Komeito-Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] bloc, 
which forms the root and trunk of the party side. Outwardly, the 
people involved deny that they are not on good terms, but to the 
extent that one looks at this chart, one can see that there 
seems no likelihood that the split between the two will be 
healed. 
  To the executives who made the table, the nucleus of the 
governing party is strictly Shinseito, Komeito, and the 
Democratic Socialist Party, plus the Japan New Party; 
furthermore, the ideal appears to be to form a new group, if 
possible, by drawing in the right faction of the SDPJ. In 
election districts in which it is judged that members of 
Sakigake and incumbent members of the SDPJ's left faction will 
run, they are throwing coalition-backed candidates against them 
without mercy. In that sense, one can say that the prediction 
table's selection of coalition-backed candidates is rather 
arbitrary. But if one bases it on the present situation of the 
Shinseito-Komeito bloc holding leadership power, there is no 
doubt that this prediction is a simulation with a high degree of 
probability. 
  "I feel it is a bit painful for the SDPJ, but it is an 
accurate judgment. It is certainly the work of a pro." 
  Political commentator Minoru Morita said that in a positive 
manner after just glancing over the table. 
  "About the time of the Kaifu government people were saying 
things like young politicians will fight in election districts 
and elders need only move to the proportional representation 
section, but after all, ultimately there is no choice but to 
field candidates who can fight. The most important thing to 
politicians and political parties is being elected, so water 
flows downward, and politicians try to survive. That is very 
clear when one looks at the table." 
  A considerable portion of the single-seat election districts 
were formed by dividing existing midsized districts into two. In 
such cases, it appears that if the governing parties' strongest 
candidate chooses one of the two districts, there will be a 
tendency for the opposition party's strongest candidate to 
choose the other district. If that happens, it means that both 
sides will be able to survive. But at the same time, the 
agricultural sector of LDP Diet members and the urban sector of 
governing party Diet members will not "get in," no matter how 
they adjust. In the end, candidates who are relatively weak in 
elections will have to switch to other parties, or transfer to 
proportional representation districts. 
<H3>  Young Japan New Party Candidates Will Be Pursued in Urban 
Sectors </H3>
  The table on the preceding page brings together those among 
incumbent Diet members who will very possibly lose their 
election districts. In the agricultural sector the names of LDP 
party elders are conspicuous, and in urban sectors it is the 
names of young Diet members of the Japan New Party, who were 
elected in the previous new party boom, and of SDPJ Diet members 
who have an air of decline. 
  Needless to say, to political parties it is more welcome for 
former Prime Minister Nakasone and Diet member Yuriko Koike of 
the Japan New Party to collect votes from throughout Japan as a 
person on the proportional representation list, than to have 
them fight a close race in a single-seat district where winning 
the election is not necessarily guaranteed. But it also remains 
to be seen whether this kind of fastidious person will move to 
proportional representation with little fuss. 
  Well, if we take it that things work out as predicted by the 
executives, the total Diet seats for the coalition parties in 
the single-seat election districts will be 153, exceeding the 
LDP's 115 Diet seats by nearly 40 seats. In particular, 
Shinseito will win 41 seats and be the top party of the 
coalition governing parties. Why is Shinseito strong? Morita 
analyzes it as follows. 
  "At present the only ones that have grassroots 
vote-gathering 
ability are the Komeito-Shinseito bloc and the LDP, which still 
has power. It is inevitable that in the single-seat election 
districts the basic pattern of the election will be a battle 
between these two." 
  Komeito, which possesses the firm support base of the Soka 
Gakkai, and Shinseito, which has been skillful in elections 
since the time of the LDP's Takeshita faction, are currently at 
the core of the government, so it is natural that they will gain 
strength. On the other hand, the hollowing out of the LDP will 
progress increasingly with the passage of time. That is the 
centripetal force of power. Even so, the provincial 
organizations that were built up over the course of 40 years 
will not crumble that easily. It seems likely that the LDP will 
continue to maintain a force that will account for a third of 
all Diet seats. 
<H3>  The Key to Understanding the Route of Reorganization of the 
Government Is... </H3>
  The downward trend will be spurred still more for the SDPJ, 
which, along with the LDP, shouldered one wing of the 1955 
system. In single-seat election districts it will be overtaken 
by Shinseito and fall to second place among the governing 
parties. According also to the prediction for proportional 
representation districts (see the table) concerning which SANDE 
MAINICHI made an estimate based on analysis of such things as 
recent public opinion polls and the past voting behavior and 
rate of votes gained for each party, the result will be that the 
SDPJ will be overtaken by the Japan New Party, and barely be 
able to garner more than 30 Diet seats. It appears that because 
of the breakup of the prefectural, regional and district 
councils, the local labor union organizations, which occurred 
along with the start of Rengo, the SDPJ will not be able to put 
a brake on the loss of support. 
  Morita dismisses it, saying, "The trend of the times is to 
seek persons with individuality. The SDPJ and Sakigake, which 
have vague policy lines, will be weeded out in the end." 
  When we look at the increases and decreases for all Diet 
seats which adds together the Diet seats which the 
governing-party executives predict for single-seat election 
districts and the Diet seats which SANDE MAINICHI predicts for 
proportional representation districts, the LDP will decline by 
nearly 40 seats from the number it has now, and, conversely, the 
governing parties will add the large number of 17 independent 
Diet members, so it will increase by about 30 Diet seats. If the 
combination of parties remains as it is now, it would probably 
mean that the Hosokawa coalition government will continue to 
shoulder the responsibility for government, and will also become 
more stable. But it is to be expected that that is not the only 
aim of the single-seat election district predictions. 
  What deserves attention here is that, even if one excludes 
the group that will switch from the LDP and which is counted as 
independents, the core governing parties bloc, consisting of 
Shinseito, Komeito, and the DSP, will total 140 Diet seats, 
which means that whether this number joins with the 62-seat 
SDPJ, or with the 54-seat Japan New Party, it will surpass the 
188 seats of the LDP. In other words, the three parties of the 
core bloc would now for the first time gain a free hand in 
re-reorganization of political circles. It seems likely that the 
aim hidden in the prediction chart will be the key to 
understanding the route to a new reorganization.

  [Text] The administration of Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa registered a support rate of 74 percent, according to 
an emergency nationwide telephone poll conducted by MAINICHI 
SHIMBUN on 31 January, immediately after the political reform 
bills were enacted the previous day. The administration has 
thus recovered the high level of support it enjoyed at the 
outset of its inauguration last August. Political reform has 
been a major political task which has been tackled for six 
years, and failure to enact political reform bills has caused 
the administrations of former Prime Ministers Toshiki Kaifu and 
Kiichi Miyazawa to topple. Apparently, the public has reacted 
favorably toward the Hosokawa administration for managing to 
have the political reform bills enacted in the final moments of 
the last Diet session. Although 70 percent of the respondents 
supported passage of the bills, many objected to easing the ban 
on corporate donations, among other points. 
  Meanwhile, the support rate for the Liberal Democratic Party 
dropped 9 percentage points from that registered in a poll 
conducted last December down to 15 percent. This is the first 
time the party's support rate has dropped below 20 percent. 
Results of the poll also showed that a record 46 percent of the 
respondents supported no particular party. 
  The support rate for the Hosokawa administration registered 
75 percent at the outset of the administration's inauguration -- 
the highest such rating ever recorded in MAINICHI SHIMBUN's 
polls. In a subsequent poll conducted last September (by 
interviewing voters), the administration's support rate dropped 
to 65 percent. It further dropped to 58 percent in a poll 
conducted in the same manner last December. Thus, the 
administration's support rate has shown a rapid downward trend. 
  The latest poll shows that 74 percent of the respondents 
support the Hosokawa administration, while 12 percent do not 
support it and 13 percent have no opinion. 
  Supporters of the administration were also asked to give 
reasons (more than one accepted) for their support. Of all the 
given reasons, 49 percent was that "the administration can be 
expected to come up with new policies"; 32 percent was that 
"Prime Minister Hosokawa has a good personality"; 30 percent was 
that "the administration is a coalition government which is not 
dominated by a single party"; and 26 percent was that "the 
administration can be expected to carry out political reform." 
The last reason ranked second in the poll conducted at the 
outset of the administration's inauguration. 
  Among reasons given by nonsupporters of the administration, 
45 percent was that "Prime Minister Hosokawa's leadership and 
abilities are doubtful"; 33 percent was that "the administration 
cannot be expected to come up with new policies"; and 31 percent 
was that "there seems to be a dual power structure within the 
government." These three negative reasons have each increased by 
5-6 percentage points over the initial poll last August. The 
fourth reason, at 30 percent, was that "the government is 
unstable because it is a coalition." This last reason has 
dropped by 13 percentage points over the initial poll.

  [Text] MAINICHI SHIMBUN conducted an emergency opinion 
poll by phone at the end of January. Regarding the 
participation of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], 
the largest ruling party, in the coalition government, 31 
percent of respondents said: "Its participation is desirable"; 
24 percent said: "It is better for the SDPJ not to 
participate"; and 44 percent said: "It is hard to say." 
  It was a shock to the SDPJ that an accord was reached on 
opening Japan's rice market at the Uruguay Round talks. The 
party has become divided on the passage of the political reform 
bills, and it has been questioned as to whether the party should 
remain in the coalition. Moreover, the party will be asked to 
undergo a "test for loyalty" in dealing with the issue of 
raising the consumption tax rate. However, the number of 
respondents favoring "the SDPJ's participation in the coalition" 
exceeds that of respondents opposing it. And yet, when a poll 
was held immediately following the coalition government's 
inauguration last August, 44 percent of respondents favored its 
participation while 11 percent opposed it. Therefore, when these 
results are compared with those of the current poll, the number 
of those who favor the participation has dropped by a large 
margin while that of those who oppose it has increased. 
  A large number of those who support various ruling coalition 
parties favor the SDPJ's participation in the coalition. In 
particular, 59 percent of those who support the SDPJ favors its 
participation while only 16 percent favors its secession from 
the coalition. On the other hand, 23 percent of those who 
support the Liberal Democratic Party favors the SDPJ's 
participation while 37 percent opposes it. As for Japan 
Communist Party supporters, 26 percent favors its participation 
and 57 percent opposes it. Of those who support the Hosokawa 
cabinet, 36 percent favors its participation while 22 percent is 
against it. Of those who answered that it is "desirable" to 
have the passage of the political reform bills, 34 percent 
supports its participation while 24 percent does not. As for 
those who answered it was "undesirable," 24 percent supports its 
participation while 29 percent is opposed. This survey was 
conducted by phone on 30 January to obtain answers from 1,000 
eligible voters throughout the country. 
  With regard to this survey's results, SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi 
Murayama said: "It reflects that the party has been forced to 
make an agonized choice." However, he also stated: "We are not 
trying to adversely influence the administration, but we must 
have our party's view reflected in the administration's policy."

  [Text] In the wake of the enactment of the political 
reform laws, YOMIURI SHIMBUN conducted a nationwide opinion poll 
to probe voters' attitudes toward the next general elections 
under the new election system. Public opinion varied regarding 
the appropriate timing for the elections, as over 30 percent 
each supported "as soon as possible after this fall" and "one or 
two years later." When asked which parties the respondents 
would like to vote for in the next elections, the LDP won 25 
percent support for single-seat constituencies, and 26 percent 
for proportional representation constituencies. While the LDP 
held the top positions in both constituencies, its popularity 
declined by 6 percent from the previous survey held in June 1993 
on the eve of the latest general elections. As the result, our 
latest survey revealed the decline of the LDP and Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]. 
  On a multiple choice question on top priority issues, the 
second largest group of 46 percent said "anti-corruption 
measures" is the most important task after the political reform 
debates, although 68 percent indicated economic issues such as 
"the yen rate appreciation, recession, and inflation" are more 
important. It appeared the public strongly believe political 
reform efforts must not be concluded with the enactment of the 
new election system. 
  Regarding the appropriate timing for the next general 
elections, 33 percent said "as soon as possible after this fall 
(when new election constituencies are prepared)," 32 percent 
said "one or two years later," and 22 percent said "elections 
are not needed until the terms of lower house members expire." 
The respondents' attitudes widely varied on the question. 
  The YOMIURI questionnaire then asked which parties the 
respondents would like to vote for in the next general 
elections. For single-seat constituencies, the support rates for 
the LDP, the Japan New Party [JNP], Shinseito, and the SDPJ were 
25, 18, 10, and 8 percent respectively. Both Sakigake and 
Komeito obtained support of 4 percent, and the Japan Communist 
Party [JCP] and the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] obtained 
support of 2 percent. The support rates for proportional 
representation constituencies were 26 percent for the LDP, 19 
percent for the JNP, 10 percent for Shinseito, 9 percent for the 
SDPJ, 4 percent for Komeito, 3 percent for Sakigake, and 2 
percent for the JCP and the DSP. In the June 1993 survey, the 
rates were 31 percent for the LDP, 15 percent for the SDPJ, and 
12 percent for the JNP; however, these figures should be 
compared with those in the latest survey because Shinseito and 
Sakigake were organized after the previous survey.

  [Text] A final draft of the "plans for promotion of future 
administrative reform," that will become a guideline for the 
government to push for administrative reform beginning 1994, 
came to light on 1 February. In response to Prime Minister 
Hosokawa's strong intention to set 1994 as a starting year for 
the administrative reform, the guideline stresses, among other 
things, the need for the government to steadily promote 
deregulation. The guideline is composed of eight points, 
including the promotion of decentralization, the promotion of 
public disclosure of administrative information, and the 
streamlining of administrative procedures. As for deregulation, 
the guideline calls for the need to review 1,450 licenses and 
approvals (800 subject to removal and 650 subject to relaxation) 
and explicitly indicates the need to amend 60 laws to that end. 
The guideline calls on the government to submit about 50 
amendments to the Diet during its current session and quickly 
draw up concrete plans for deregulation. 
  The Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters (headed by 
Prime Minister Hosokawa) will formally decide on the guideline 
as part of a new package of stimulus measures on which the 
government plans to decide on 3 February. 
  The government intends to make a thorough review of 
deregulation in line with a final report compiled by the 
Economic Reform Research Council (the Hiraiwa Committee). The 
government is examining ways to draw up a "five-year plan for 
the promotion of deregulation" in 1994 and to incorporate a 
clause in the law that if a regulation is put into effect, it 
shall be reviewed after a certain period. 
  On decentralization, the guideline calls on the government 
to 
review the current share of administrative functions between the 
central and local governments, promote the transfer of 
administrative authority from the central government to local 
governments, and promote the ban or relaxation of the central 
government's intervention in local government affairs. The 
guideline also calls on the government to set a "guideline for 
changing the current administrative relationship between the 
central and local governments" on the premise that the 
government tries to have the Diet legislate a basic law on the 
promotion of decentralization. 
  As for the public disclosure of administrative information, 
the guideline calls on the Administrative Reform Committee to 
make a full-fledged study of systems involving the public 
disclosure of administrative information, while calling on the 
government to look for a way to smoothly enforce laws concerning 
administrative procedures.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Hosokawa Needs To Take Open And Aboveboard </F>
Attitude] 
  [Text] The government's conclusion on reforming the tax 
system, which has been a major point in the coming economic 
stimulus measures, came about in the early morning of 3 
February, when Prime Minister Hosokawa made a political 
decision. Prime Minister Hosokawa said that a 6-trillion-yen 
[Y] reduction in income and resident taxes will be carried out 
while the consumption tax will be replaced with a 7 percent 
national welfare tax. The prime minister said that the proposed 
tax system is designed to help boost the economy, noting the tax 
reductions will be retroactive to 1 January 1994 and the tax 
increase will go into effect in April 1997 -- about three years 
after the tax reduction is carried out. 
  We would like to give a positive evaluation to the 
government's proposal because the prime minister's decision 
basically reflects the purpose of tax system reform aimed at 
introducing a new tax system that imposes adequate taxes on 
income, consumption, and properties so that the people feel 
impartial about their own tax burden. We would also like to 
admit that even though a future tax hike is scheduled, the tax 
reductions will have instant an effect on the economy. 
  There is the opinion that it would be more effective to 
increase taxes two or three years after a tax cut is carried 
out. However, of course, there is a counter-argument that the 
people would feel uneasy about when and what sort of tax 
increase will be carried out and that such a plan would curb 
economic activities. Above all, we would like to stress that 
this issue's real substance lies in tax system reform. 
  For those reasons, we can basically support the government's 
decision. However, there is a problem in the government's 
decision- making process. Although we do not simply subscribe 
to a critical view that the government has formed a hasty 
conclusion without listening to public opinion and the ruling 
parties' opinions, we wonder why the prime minister could not 
simply say that the government will raise the consumption tax. 
He must have thought that the government's introduction of the 
national welfare tax, which replaces the consumption tax, can 
win the people's understanding. But it is wrong. 
  However hard one thinks, a national welfare tax is a 
consumption tax. There is no doubt that most of the people will 
consider the government's proposal as deceiving the people, and 
the people will increase their opposition to the proposal. Most 
of the taxpayers must be considering that the consumption tax 
has taken root in its own way except political activists, 
scholars who stick to their own ideas, and their followers. In 
this sense, the prime minister should have openly and logically 
explained the reason the government has to raise the consumption 
tax. If he takes such an honest attitude, the people would 
further support his government. 
  We also wonder why the amount of the tax increase is set at 
Y9.5 trillion despite the amount for the tax cut being Y6 
trillion. We think the tax increase is too big, even if various 
welfare measures are taken under the name of the national 
welfare tax. The government is required to study the 
possibility of expanding the scale of tax reductions including 
corporate taxes. 
  It will take a little more time to make a final decision. 
Thorough discussions by the Tax System Reform Council are 
scheduled to begin soon. In promoting discussions, there are 
many things to discuss -- such as whether three years is an 
adequate grace period for the tax increase, whether some 
portions of the current consumption tax system should be 
reviewed, and for what purposes the national welfare tax should 
be used.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Hosokawa Administration Urged to Return to </F>
  Its Original Stance of `Implementing Tax Reductions First'"] 
  [Text] The government and the ruling coalition parties 
decided to scrap the plan to introduce a "national welfare tax" 
and implement an income tax cut. It is unusual to scrap an 
official announcement by a prime minister. However, judging 
from the fact that this is a deep-rooted issue, it is a rightful 
decision. It is time for the Hosokawa administration to 
recognize the severity of the Japanese economy, which is bogged 
down in the worst recession of the postwar era, and rush to 
fine-tune economic measures by returning to its original stance 
of "implementing tax reductions first." 
  There were some doubts about the contents of this tax 
concept, which Prime Minister Hosokawa announced abruptly, and 
about the policy making method. A substantial tax increase will 
thwart economic recovery. The announcement to introduce a 
welfare tax, which was merely a consumption tax with a different 
name, was nothing but an attempt to fool the people. There was 
absolutely no reason to change the name. It is not clear how 
this concept came about or what kind of decision-making 
processes were taken. 
  We have to say that the recent announcement, which should 
have been made only after obtaining the people's understanding, 
was an unskillful act. Since the official announcement was 
scrapped, the prime minister should do some soul-searching. 
  On the other hand, we have many doubts about a revised 
proposal made by the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], 
which fiercely opposed the prime minister's concept. The 
proposal to turn the welfare tax into an object tax will be 
linked to freezing revenue from that financial resource. There 
is a possibility that no rules will be applied to the use of the 
revenue from the object tax. It is necessary to use every 
available means to avoid the introduction of an object tax. An 
income tax reduction will have no meaning unless it is linked to 
a revision of the tax system, which includes a review of the tax 
rates. The SDPJ's proposal to turn the consumption tax into a 
refundable tax is indeed an easygoing way of thinking. 
  Following the scrapping of the prime minister's plan, the 
government and the ruling coalition parties must first ask 
themselves what is expected of the Japanese economy now. It 
seems that the Hosokawa administration's debate over the tax 
system was being promoted on the precondition that a "tax 
increase is a must." It is strange that we hardly heard that the 
debate had been held because of details of the income tax 
reduction plan. What we should recall is that a large-scale 
income tax reduction is needed for the Japanese economy, which 
is in a serious recession, before securing a source of revenue. 
  We have repeatedly said that an income tax reduction 
amounting to over 6 trillion yen should be introduced first, as 
a pillar of the government's economic package, and that the 
consumption tax rate should be raised to six percent when 
economic recovery becomes apparent. The amount of this tax 
reduction will be about the same as that of the tax increase. 
We are certain that the income tax reduction will act as a 
measure needed for the time being to recover from the recession 
and to revise the ratio difference between direct and indirect 
taxes. We need to revise the tax rate difference between direct 
and indirect taxes so that we are prepared for the advent of an 
aged society. 
  An introduction of comprehensive economic measures was 
delayed due to the deadlocked tax debate. There is a 
possibility that the compilation of a budget for fiscal 1994 
will be further delayed unless the tax reduction issue is 
settled. This delay will have negative impacts on local 
autonomies' budget compilation too. We cannot ignore its 
psychological effect on industries either. 
  The Japan-U.S. summit talks are just ahead while both 
countries are still divided over the issue of setting numeric 
targets for individual fields. Under such circumstances, we are 
certain that Japan-U.S. relations will become tense. 
  Regarding the important tax issue, the Hosokawa 
administration should not rely on a rough-and-ready method 
again. However, we hope that the same administration will come 
up with responsible conclusions that are acceptable to the 
people as soon as possible. We hope that the prime minister, in 
doing that, will not only listen to the Financial Ministry's 
narrow-minded financial theories, but will make a decision with 
an eye on the current severe economic situation and on Japan's 
future economy. The Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] has many 
politicians who are familiar with the tax system. If it thinks 
the Japanese economy is in a critical state, the LDP should stop 
criticizing the Hosokawa administration's blunder. It is the 
LDP's turn to cross the line of party interests and propose 
concrete economic measures.

  [Text] It seems that the scale of comprehensive economic 
measures, which the government will announce soon, will reach 
some 15.1 trillion yen in total, the largest ever. The package 
will consist of 5.7 trillion yen in tax reductions, including 
income and resident tax cuts and expansion of housing-related 
tax system, and 9.4 trillion yen in public investment and loans, 
such as public works projects. A possibility of studying new 
measure -- designed to liquidate interest reduction and 
exemption bonds payable to nonbank and other companies by 
selling them to bond purchasing companies to urge private 
financial institutions to deal with bad bonds they have -- will 
be incorporated in the package. However, the process of 
coordinating views among the ruling parties on the issue of 
finding financial sources to cover a shortfall, which will be 
created by tax reductions, is experiencing rough sailing. 
Because of this, there is a possibility that the total amount of 
the package may change depending on the outcome of the 
coordination process. 
  The details of the public investment and loans in the 
comprehensive economic measures are: 5 trillion yen for "public 
investments," 2.8 trillion yen for purchasing land before 
mapping out utilization plans for it to activate land 
transactions, and 1.3 trillion yen for helping 
small-to-medium-sized enterprises. 
  Of the 5 trillion yen for public investments, 2.9 trillion 
yen will be allocated for additional general public works 
projects and public corporations' projects for fiscal 1993. 
Regarding expenses for improving facilities, additional 600 
billion yen will be earmarked mainly for education, research, 
and medical services. The government will ask the 
municipalities to increase the amount of public works projects, 
which local governments will carry out independently, by about 
300 billion yen. Amount of the Housing Loan Corporation's 
housing loans will be increased by 1.2 trillion yen, which is 
enough to cover loans for 70,000 housing units. 
  Of the 2.8 trillion yen for purchasing land before mapping 
out utilization plans for it, 500 billion yen will be secured 
for purchases of new land for general urban development 
projects. Land purchases for these projects will be made through 
a private [minkan] organization for promotion of urban 
development.

  [Text] The Small and Medium Enterprise Agency [SMEA] under 
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] will set 
up a new loan system -- as one of the new economic stimulus 
measures to support small and medium companies planning to start 
new business. This system will focus on those small and medium 
companies that have technological potential but lack good 
business performance at this point. On the condition of 
accepting business administration guidance from the Small 
Business Finance Corporation [SBFC], each company may obtain 
loans up to 600 million yen [Y], of which up to Y40 million will 
be provided without collateral, which will be a special measure 
of this system. The total amount of loans in the first fiscal 
year may reach Y60 billion. The SMEA plans to support these 
ambitious companies by expanding loans without collateral. 
Normally, private financial organs are negative about providing 
such loans. 
  The new system, which is called the "Loan System To Foster 
New Business" (tentative name), aims at providing loans to those 
small enterprises that offer unique services or have unique 
technology but have difficulties in raising funds from private 
financial organs due to lack of good business performance or 
sufficient collateral; such loans will be earmarked for starting 
new business. Under this system, the interest rate will be set 
at the current SBFC standard rate of 3.65 percent plus an 
additional 0.3 percent, and the maximum loan term can be set for 
15 years. 
  The committee on fostering new business, to be set up at the 
SBFC, will check such factors as the new business' potential and 
technology. MITI considers that if the SBFC can continue to 
provide management guidance after financing, dependability of 
new businesses may increase; and that this system may serve as 
"priming water" for expansion of loans by private financial 
organs. 
  Originally, MITI studied the possibility of starting the new 
loan system in fiscal 1994. However, since small and medium 
companies seem to have lost their interest in starting new 
business due to such factors as the drop in the number of 
companies that have started new businesses due to the prolonged 
recession, MITI will start the system after the third 
supplementary budget is approved ahead of schedule. 
  Private financial organs have restrained from providing 
loans 
to areas involved with high risk. Thus, MITI has decided that 
expansion of support from government-affiliated financial organs 
is indispensable to the fostering of new industries.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, February 3 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The main 
force of the political opposition in the country the Mongolian 
National Democratic Party [NDP] has given up its intention to 
cooperate with the government formed by the Mongolian People's 
Revolutionary Party two years ago. The leadership of the party 
announced the other day about its refusal of their suggestions 
having been submitted to the prime minister last autumn. The 
twelve points of those suggestions included some particular 
ideas designed at the way out of the crises for the national 
economy. 
  The repudition of any intentions to cooperate with the 
government the party explains by that the governmental programme 
has fully been discredited the government itself has been 
steeped in corruption and abuses of official position which 
relates to its top level most. [sentence as received] As a 
pretext for such statements served the recent statement by chief 
of the counterintelligence colonel L. Sanjaasuren. He accused 
the chairman of the parliament, his deputy and the premier of 
the government of criminal liaison with citizens of China 
working, according to the data available in this office, for the 
secret services of the southern neighbour.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 2 KYODO -- The United States and Russia 
are apparently planning to hold unprecedented joint military 
exercises, a senior Japanese Foreign Ministry source said 
Wednesday [2 February]. 
  The source said the subject was broached by the former enemy 
powers in a two-day meeting in Tokyo of military brass, 
government officials and academicians from the U.S., Russia and 
Japan. The closed-door discussions on Tuesday and Wednesday, 
the first of their kind to be participated in by all three 
countries, took place in the Trilateral Forum on North Pacific 
Security organized by the Japan Institute of International 
Affairs. 
  According to the source, the participants discussed the 
promotion of a "strategic partnership" between the U.S. and 
Russia. He said it appeared from the discussions that talks on 
joint military exercises were already under way. There were 
suggestions that Japan also participate, but the idea was 
dismissed by Japanese participants as premature, he said. 
  The U.S. participants included Assistant Defense Secretary 
Graham Allison and Adm. Frank Bowman, deputy director for 
political and military affairs on the Joint Chiefs of Staff at 
the Pentagon. 
  Attending from Russia were Deputy Foreign Minister Georgiy 
Mamedov, Gen. Andrey Nikolayev, head of the Russian Federal 
Border Service and commander-in-chief of the border forces, and 
Col. Gen. Vladimir Zhurbenko, deputy chief of Joint Staff of the 
Armed Forces. 
  Japanese participants included Yoshiji Nogami, deputy 
director general of the Foreign Ministry's Foreign Policy 
Bureau, and Maj. Gen. Toshimasa Fujiwara, a member of the 
Self-Defense Forces' Joint Staff Office in charge of plans and 
policies. 
  The source said the Russian side expressed a desire to see 
Russia's entry into the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
forum in the future, despite an existing moratorium on adding 
new members. The meeting also covered such subjects as Russia's 
new military doctrine, North Korea's suspected nuclear 
development program, and the future situation surrounding China, 
he said. Japanese participants endeavored to keep discussions 
of China to a minimum since no Chinese participants were present 
at the meeting, the source said. While China and other 
countries may be invited to future meetings, there was not yet 
any consensus on expanding participation, he said. 
  Two more such meetings are planned, the next to be held in 
Moscow, possibly in September, after which a set of policy 
recommendations may be issued to the governments of the three 
countries.

  [Text] Beijing, Feb 9 (AFP) -- Pyongyang "is prepared for 
war" should Washington force the imposition of sanctions over 
the nuclear issue, a North Korean diplomat said here Wednesday. 
"If the United States decides to make sanctions against us we 
can answer. These sanctions are pressure against us so we are 
prepared for war or peace," North Korean Counsellor to Beijing 
Choe Han-chun told journalists. 
  North Korea has refused to accept International Atomic 
Energy 
Agency (IAEA) inspections of facilities in Yongbyon, north of 
Pyongyang, suspected by Western countries of storing plutonium 
for making nuclear weapons. Washington and Seoul have warned 
Pyongyang that it would face concerted international action, 
most likely sanctions, if it fails to agree to inspections 
before February 21, when the IAEA convenes a board of governors' 
meeting. 
  Choe said the hardline Stalinist state would agree to 
inspections only when "the United States is not trying to force 
us and make the circumstances to receive the inspection." 
However, he reiterated that his country would not open all its 
facilities to "irregular and ad hoc" inspections, as the IAEA is 
demanding. "To inspect all facilities means we give full scope 
inspection -- we did not promise this inspection to the United 
States. We promised only for guaranteeing the continuity of the 
safeguard," he said. Choe said the situation on the Korean 
peninsula would remain "dangerous and still strained" until the 
United States and South Korea called off planned Team Spirit 
military exercises. 
  China -- which has veto power on the U.N. Security Council 
-- 
has opposed sanctions, cautioning that they could drive isolated 
North Korea to an unpredictable response and urging the United 
States to continue negotiations.

<F P=106> ["Papers Rap at Han Sung-chu's Sophism on `Nuclear Issue'" </F>
-- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 9 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
puppet foreign minister, Han Sung-chu, at a recent "meeting of 
heads of embassies and legations abroad" blared that it is the 
stand of the "government" to take "a stern measure" in case the 
"nuclear issue of the North" is not solved. And the South 
Korean Christian Broadcasting System (CBS) reported that Han 
Sung-chu would meet with U.S. masters to "readjust" the stand 
of both sides and discuss the socalled "follow-up measures" 
pursuant to the "resolution" of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency. 
  Commenting on this, papers here today say this suggests that 
the South Korean puppets will seek international "pressure" and 
"sanctions" against the fellow countrymen in the North in league 
with outside forces at whatever costs. 
  An analyst of NODONG SINMUN says: 
  The South Korean puppets have neither qualification nor face 
to run about with the "nuclear issue" of the North. 
  It is imprudent, ridiculous and shameless that the very ones 
creating nuclear threats on the Korean peninsula are crying over 
the "nuclear issue" of the North. This reminds people of a 
thief crying "stop thief". 
  It is clear that the South Korean puppets are trying to put 
a 
spoke in the wheel of the third round of the DPRK-USA talks 
aimed at solving the nuclear issue and do harm to the fellow 
countrymen in the North in league with the outside forces. 
  Such malicious act can be committed only by traitors who are 
dyed to the marrow with flunkeyism and treachery. 
  The reality proves that with traitors such as Kim Yong-sam 
and Han Sung-chu left alone, neither reunification nor peace of 
the country can be achieved. If the puppets, together with the 
outside forces, seek to slay fellow countrymen in defiance of 
the desire of the nation, it will result in precipitating their 
self-destruction.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 9 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
DPRK Foreign Ministry in a statement today decisively rejects 
the reckless act of the United States in accusing the DPRK of 
the fictitious "human rights problem" as a violation of its 
sovereignty prompted by a political aim to stifle its system and 
as a hostile act of interference in its internal affairs. 
  The statement says: 
  The U.S. State Department, in its "Annual Report on the 
World Human Rights Situation" published on February 1, 
groundlessly slandered our country as if there were a "human 
rights problem" in our country. This is a gross distortion of 
the reality of our country and fabrication which does not 
deserve a passing note. 
  As far as human rights are concerned, it is a matter of 
socio-political rights and economic and cultural rights 
including the dignity, sovereignty and the right to existence, 
equality and the right to development which must be guaranteed 
to man in society. 
  All these rights are fully ensured in our country. 
  Our people are genuine masters of the state and society and 
enjoy an independent and creative life all alike without any 
social and political uncertainty or any worry about their life 
under our anthropocentric socialist system. In our country 
there is not a single jobless person, nor a beggar, nor a 
vagabond, nor an illiterate, nor a drug addict. Ours is a state 
where human rights are respected and surely guaranteed. 
  This notwithstanding, the United States hurled malicious 
abuses at our country. This is part of its brazen scheme to 
tarnish the image of our Republic with the nonsensical "human 
rights problem" as it does with the fictitious "nuclear problem" 
of our country and to isolate and stifle our socialist cause. 
  What face does the United States have to criticize others 
over the "human rights issue"? 
  At present, there are in the United States more than 1.4 
million prisoners, over 9 million unemployed people, millions of 
vagabonds and 35 million people living below the poverty line. 
And it is plagued with criminal cases of murder by arms 
claiming the lives of more than 38,000 people a year and drug 
consumption which accounts for 65 percent of the world's drug 
output, and narcotic-related crimes which are quite common. 
This is inevitable and is an incurable cancer under the present 
U.S. social system. 
  The U.S. President himself could not but admit in his "State 
of the Union Address" this year to the grave phenomena 
threatening the U.S. public including violent crimes. 
  We see almost every day that the United States not only 
harshly tramples upon the human rights of its people but also 
perpetrated such inhuman acts as openly overthrowing and 
destroying sovereign states with the mobilization of its state 
Armed Forces and making havoc with their people's human rights, 
while highhandedly interfering in the internal affairs of other 
countries. 
  All these facts prove that the United States is the 
universally recognized worst graveyard of human rights and the 
kingdom of human rights abuses. 
  It is the height of impudence for the United States to talk 
about other's human rights situation, while freely violating 
human rights within and without. 
  In its "Report on Human Rights Situation" the U.S. State 
Department tried to beautify South Korea in a far-fetched way, 
claiming that the situation of human rights has been "improved" 
there. This is also the height of sarcasm. 
  The South Korean authorities under the mask of "civilian 
government" are getting frenzied in terrorism, arrest, torture 
and murder in reliance on the "National Security Law" and other 
fascist laws and repressive tools, overshadowing the successive 
military dictators. 
  And countless are cases of human rights abuses by the 
U.S. Forces present in South Korea. 
  As regards the present South Korean situation in which human 
rights abuses have been carried into extremes, however, the 
United States dare argue that "the human rights situation has 
improved" there. This is really a brazen-faced deception. 
  Whatever row the United States may raise over the "human 
rights problem" it can never impair the essential advantages and 
invincible vitality of socialism of our style to which the 
chuche idea is applied. 
  The United States would be well advised to mind its own 
business, instead of taking stock of other nations and 
instructing them, while acting "a judge of human rights" whom 
nobody recognizes.

challenged the allegations of the Central Intelligence Agency 
(CIA) of the United States about North Korea at an action forum 
held in Chicago under the sponsorship of the U.S. academic and 
religious circles. 
  The paper conveys their remarks as follows: 
  Professor of East Asian and International History, Bruce 
Cummings, pointed to the different estimates of the U.S. State 
Department, which says, "North Korea may have nuclear weapons" 
and the CIA, which says the North Koreans have them. 
  Cummings said the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
relies heavily on the CIA for its "information about North 
Korean nuclear capability," although IAEA has conducted a series 
of full inspections of North Korean nuclear sites. 
  These inspections have been allowed even though the first 
section of the IAEA's statutes say that any nation can refuse to 
allow such inspections if it feels another country threatens its 
security. 
  Referring to the question of why the CIA persists in its 
claim that North Korea has nuclear weapons, Professor Henry Em, 
candidate in history, University of Chicago and instructor at 
Lake Forest College, charged that the CIA is fighting to 
maintain its 300 billion dollars annual budget and strives to 
maintain a "threat of dangerous enemies" as a means to gain 
public and congressional support. 
  Em said: "The attitudes ascribed to North Korea can be 
better 
applied to the CIA--that it is dangerous, unstable and 
self-serving."

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 9 (KCNA) -- The U.S. 
imperialists on February 6 and 7 mobilized overseas-based combat 
flying groups in an exercise of long-distance mobility and 
deployment in South Korean bases, according to military sources. 
  The exercise held with the support of KC-135 tanker planes 
was an extremely reckless war gamble aimed at examining 
overseas-based flying groups' capability of quick movement and 
deployment and entry into a war according to the war scenario of 
the U.S. imperialists. 
  In separate action on February 7, formations of Japan-based 
fighter planes of different types flew above the operational 
zones in Yongwol and Pyongchang in an exercise of surprise 
attack and intensive bombing. 
  Such war maneuvers of the U.S. imperialists, timed to 
synchronize with the heinous anti-DPRK campaign they have 
launched on the pretext of the fictitious "nuclear problem" of 
the DPRK, are premeditated acts of provocation designed to 
render the situation on the Korean peninsula further strained.

plot to obstruct the national reunification," and rushed toward 
the "American Cultural Centre" in Kwangju. 
  When riot police blocked their way firing tear gas the 
protesters resisted them with rocks.

<F P=106> ["Ozawa's Utterances Betraying Heinous Intention of Japanese </F>
Reactionaries" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 9 (KCNA) -- Ichiro Ozawa, 
representative of the Japan Renewal Party, in an interview with 
Fuji Television on February 6 raved that the DPRK might take "a 
military action" and Japan must examine "a countermeasure" to 
cope with "the event of contingency" on the Korean peninsula, 
slandering the system of the DPRK. Commenting on this, NODONG 
SINMUN in a commentary today brands the utterances of Ozawa as a 
dangerous aggressive blast that betrays the heinous intention of 
the Japanese reactionaries to play the role of a shock brigade 
of the imperialists in isolating and stifling our socialism. 
  The analyst says: 
  Ozawa tried to create an atmosphere of terror with the 
outcries over "a military action" of the DPRK. This may be 
termed "a shock propaganda" designed to channel public opinion 
to a support to the conversion of Japan into a military power 
and its nuclear armament. 
  No matter how loudly Ozawa may cry over "threat" from the 
DPRK, it can convince none of the people who have an unbiased 
view of things. The world considers that Japan, with its huge 
stockpile of plutonium, can become a nuclear power in a short 
time, if it decides to. 
  Having paved the way for troop dispatch overseas, Japan is 
going to embark upon reinvasion in Asia, taking Korea as the 
first target. Ozawa's call for examining "a countermeasure" to 
cope with "the event of contingency" on the Korean peninsula 
revealed the intention of Japan to round off the preparations 
for aggression on Korea and move up the date of military action. 
  The Korean people will never allow anyone to infringe upon 
the dignity and sovereignty of our Republic and hurl mud at our 
system. 
  The Japanese reactionaries must act with discretion, mindful 
that the conversion of Japan into a military power, its nuclear 
armament and a war of aggression would lead them to destruction.

  [Text] Tokyo, February 7 (KNS-KCNA) -- The inaugural 
meeting of the Human Rights Association of Koreans in Japan took 
place here on February 5. 
  Ho Chong-man, chief vice-chairman of the Central Standing 
Committee of the General Association of Korean Residents in 
Japan (Chongnyon), made a congratulatory speech at the meeting. 
  He said the formation of the association was of great 
significance not only in upholding the great leader 
Generalissimo Kim Il-song and the dear leader Marshal Kim 
Chong-il with loyalty and defending and exalting the 
anthropocentric socialist homeland of chuche but also in 
developing the patriotic movement of Chongnyon to defend and 
expand the rights and life of Koreans in Japan by bringing 
together their legal and economic knowhow and technologies. 
  Solidarity greetings were made by Japanese figures who were 
present at the meeting as observers. 
  A letter to Generalissimo Kim Il-song was adopted at the 
meeting.

  [Excerpts] Cairo, 8 Feb (MENA)--Kim Yong-sop, North Korea's 
ambassador to Egypt, has stated that the Korean people are 
looking forward to President Husni Mubarak's visit to the 
country later this year. 
  The North Korean ambassador held a news conference at the 
North Korean Embassy in Cairo today to mark the 52d birthday of 
Kim Chong-il, chairman of the North Korean Defense Committee and 
son of the country's leader Kim Il-song. He spoke of the tense 
situation in the Korean peninsula and praised the friendly 
relations between Egypt and his country. [passage omitted] 
  On the situation in the Korean peninsula, he said that the 
tension has risen to an unprecedented level in the past few days 
and that his government is making intensive efforts to reunite 
the two parts of the country by peaceful means and through 
dialogue. He noted that the United States is not abiding by the 
clauses of several agreements it concluded with North Korea in 
recent negotiations and at the same time it is demanding that 
North Korea fulfill its commitments or face political and 
economic pressures. 
  Kim Yong-sop said that the International Atomic Energy 
Agency 
[IAEA] continues to use a double standard and although the 
United States decided to halt the Team Spirit maneuvers, it 
announced it will carry out another major military exercise. 
  He said: We demand that Washington halt these maneuvers, not 
merely change their names, in order to ease the tension and 
create an appropriate atmosphere for negotiations. 
  The ambassador said: The United States has announced it will 
deploy Patriot missiles in South Korea, which would escalate the 
tension to the point of war, although we want peace. He 
asserted that if Washington does not fulfill its commitments, 
North Korea will also not abide by its pledges, will consider 
suspending its IAEA membership, and transform its current 
reactors which are employed for useful purposes into nuclear 
reactors [as received]. 
  He added that North Korea will not beg for a resumption of 
the negotiations, explaining: We agreed to negotiate in order 
to ease the tension. We can live without U.S. aid or 
assistance. If the United States resorts to sanctions, we will 
adopt the necessary measures in response. 
  Regarding the position adopted by South Korea and 
neighboring 
countries on these developments, the North Korean ambassador 
said that the South Korean authorities persist in depending on 
foreign forces and turn their backs on the Korean people in the 
north. 
  He remarked: We believe that if the problems between us and 
the United States are solved, our relationship with Seoul will 
automatically improve. 
  He said: Neighboring countries like China, Japan, and Russia 
have different attitudes on this issue. We respect the views of 
others and are trying to develop friendly ties with them. We 
hope that these countries will not escalate tension in this 
region.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 9 (KCNA) -- The praise of the 
dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il by all people is growing higher 
with each passing day. 
  It is an irresistible trend of the present times for the 
world people to deeply trust and revere Comrade Kim Chong-il who 
is guiding the cause of independence to victory with his 
tested and veteran leadership. 
  A typical instance is that gifts of best wishes are 
presented to him from many countries every year. 
  Last year, he received precious gifts from party and state 
leaders of more than 100 countries including Chairman of the 
C.C. [Central Committee], the Lao People's Revolutionary Party 
and Premier of the Lao Government Khamtai Siphandon, Syrian 
President Hafiz al-Asad and Afghan President Borhanoddin

Chong-il, treasured swords and gold and silver knives showing 
their ardent desire for his longevity in good health and hunting 
equipment and rare medicines. 
  Among the gifts there are many ornaments of thick national 
coloring, special clocks, high-grade musical instruments and 
valuable relics. 
  The praise and reverence for Comrade Kim Chong-il are found 
in the fact that books praising his great ideology and theory 
and feats and noble virtues have been written and published in 
many copies in a host of countries. 
  "Kim Chong-il and Shining Korea" (Pakistan), "The Lodestar 
Which Has Risen Over Korea" (Nepal), "The Genius of the East" 
(Syria), "Kim Chong-il, Brilliant Great Man" (Mali), "Collection 
of Papers Marking the 50th Birthday of the Dear Leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il" (Japan), "Art of Diamond" (Peru) and many other 
books have been written and published in recent years to be 
widely read. 
  Praise of the revolutionary exploits performed by Comrade 
Kim 
Chong-il finds manifestation in orders, medals, honorary titles 
of various countries awarded to him. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il has received supreme orders of many 
countries including the Kiettikhoun Order (Laos), the Grand 
Cordon of the National Order of Leopard (Zaire), the Grand Order 
of Independence (Equatorial Guinea) and the Grand Cross (Mali) 
and last year he was awarded the Star Order of Sacred Kuds of 
Palestine and medals of Bagneux City, France; and Marinha

professor of the Iquitos and Los Andes de Huancayo Universities

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 9 (KCNA) -- Kim Ki-nam, 
secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of 
Korea, made a report on the subject "Modelling of the whole 
society on the chuche idea is a great programme of socialist and 
communist construction in our age" at a national symposium 
marking the 20th anniversary of the proclamation of the 
programme for modelling the whole society on the chuche idea 
which opened Tuesday in Pyongyang. 
  The reporter said: 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in February 1974, 20 
years ago, proclaimed modelling the whole society on the chuche 
idea as the supreme programme of our party with his scientific 
insight into the mature requirement of our developing revolution 
which had entered a new stage and into the process of 
development of the world socialist movement. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il said: 
  "...It is a completely mature requirement to dye the whole 
society in one idea, the revolutionary idea of the leader under 
the present condition of our country." 
  The reporter pointed out: 
  A new guiding idea was required by the new historic era in 
which the popular masses had presented themselves as masters of 
history and their destiny and the revolutionary struggle of the 
popular masses for socialism had entered a new stage. 
  It had become the desire of the revolutionary people of the 
world and urgent requirement of the times to build socialist and 
communist society with the chuche idea of the respected leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song as the guiding idea of revolution and under 
its banner. 
  This demand of the times concerning the destiny of the 
socialist and communist cause was fully met when the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il scientifically formulated the revolutionary 
idea of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and proclaimed it 
as the guiding idea of revolution in our era. 
  The revolutionary idea of Comrade Kim Il-song is, in a word, 
a system of the idea, theory and method of chuche. 
  The characteristics of the revolutionary idea of Comrade Kim 
Il-song which distinguishes it from the preceding revolutionary 
theories of the working class, is that its quintessence is the 
great chuche idea, the first of its kind in the history of human 
thought, and it systematizes the revolutionary theory and the 
method of leadership in an integral way on its basis. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il expounded that the 
revolutionary idea of Comrade Kim Il-song, different from the 
preceding revolutionary ideas of the working class which were 
the combination of separate doctrines, gives answers to all the 
theoretical and practical questions of revolution and 
construction, proceeding from one man-centered philosophical 
principle and one basic idea of respect for humanity. This is 
an immortal exploit in that he elucidated the fundamental 
characteristics of the revolutionary idea of Comrade Kim Il-song 
and its absolute superiority to the preceding revolutionary 
ideas of the working class. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il, formulating the revolutionary idea of 
Comrade Kim Il-song, scientifically expounded that his 
revolutionary idea is an encyclopedic revolutionary idea 
containing theories of all fields of transforming nature, 
society and man and all stages of revolution and construction. 
  Thus it has been convincingly proved that the revolutionary 
idea of Comrade Kim Il-song is a flawless communist 
revolutionary theory leading the revolution and construction of 
our era to victory and an almighty treasured sword which should 
be tightly held in the whole course of the revolutionary 
struggle to realise the independence of the popular masses. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il, after proclaiming the great chuche 
idea 
as the guiding idea of the times, set it forth as a great 
programme of communist construction to dye the whole society in 
one idea, the revolutionary idea of Comrade Kim Il-song. 
  The programme for modelling the whole society on the chuche 
idea is a programme of communist construction to remould man, 
reform society and remake nature as required by the chuche idea 
and thus build and complete communist society which is based on 
the chuche idea and to which it is fully applied. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il was the first in 
history 
to define the course of socialist and communist construction as 
a course of embodying the revolutionary idea of the leader and 
dying society in the revolutionary idea of the leader by 
proclaiming the programme for modelling the whole society on the 
chuche idea. 
  The proclamation of the programme is a scientific discovery 
that socialist and communist society is, in essence, a society 
in which the independence of the popular masses has been fully 
realised and, at the same time, the whole of it is 
singleheartedly united. 
  With the proclamation of the programme by Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, it has become clear that socialist and communist 
society is a society in which the independence of the popular 
masses has been completely realised in all fields of social life 
and that the strategic target of socialist and communist 
construction is to occupy the ideological and political fortress 
and the material fortress by remaking nature, reforming society 
and remoulding man to meet the demand of the popular masses for 
independence. 
  Thus the limitation of the preceding theory that communism 
can be realised only if the material wealth is increased by 
developing productive forces was overcome and the 
unreasonableness and reactionary essence of the view of the 
modern revisionists who pursued only "material prosperity" was 
exposed and refuted. 
  At the same time, the programme clarified that socialist and 
communist society is a society of singlehearted unity all 
members of which are closely united as comrades to form a 
socio-political organism. 
  The programme is a programme of singlehearted unity which 
fully embodies and consummates the unique idea and revolutionary 
stand on dying the whole society in the chuche idea to make it a 
community of destiny whose members are united around the leader 
with comradely love and revolutionary obligation on the basis of 
the idea of the leader. 
  For this the banner of singlehearted unity is a great 
revolutionary banner which firmly guarantees the victory of 
socialist and communist construction. 
  It is, indeed, the immortal exploits of the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il which will shine through generations with 
the advance of history and the eternal treasure of the chuche 
cause that, by scientifically formulating the revolutionary idea 
of Comrade Kim Il-song and proclaiming the programme for 
modelling the whole society on the chuche idea, he exalted the 
revolutionary idea of the great leader as the guiding idea of 
the age of independence and opened a true way of building 
socialism and communism in which the independence of the popular 
masses will have been completely realised on the basis of the 
chuche idea. 
  The reporter noted that the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il 
has wisely led the struggle of our people to materialize the 
programme for modelling the whole society on the chuche idea. 
  He said: 
  What holds a brilliant place in the great exploits of the 
dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il who has led the socialist cause 
of our people to victory under the banner of modelling the whole 
society on the chuche idea is, first of all, that he made clear 
the essence of socialism and the law of its realisation and has 
turned our socialism into socialism of chuche. 
  By studying socialism centering on the popular masses by 
applying the chuche idea, he overcame the limitation of the 
preceding socialist idea and theory attaching decisive 
significance to economic necessity by placing economic relations 
in the center and clarified that socialism is not only a society 
where social equality prevails, free from exploitation and 
oppression of man by man, but also a society where the popular 
masses lead an independent and creative life suitable to the 
intrinsic character of social human beings, firmly united in 
comradeship as the common masters of the state and society. 
  After establishing the scientific idea and theory on 
socialism centering on the popular masses, he has successfully 
applied this great idea and has wisely led the struggle to 
remould and develop man, economy, culture and all other sectors 
of social life under the banner of the three revolutions, 
ideoligical, technical and cultural, to suit the nature of 
socialist society. 
  What holds a brilliant place in his great exploits in 
leading 
the socialist cause of our people to victory under the banner of 
modelling the whole society on the chuche idea is also that he 
expounded a new revolutionary idea on the formula of building 
socialism and has decisively turned the chuche style, the Korean 
style into a universal revolutionary formula of our times. 
  He, making it his motto of revolution to establish chuche, 
put forward the revolutionary slogan "Let us live our own way" 
and successfully applied the unique idea of carrying on 
revolution our own way and creditably fulfilled the historic 
tasks raised by the socialist movement of our times. 
  Embodied in our style, the chuche style are man-centered 
chuche philosophy, politics centering on the popular masses, our 
people's consciousness of national independence and national 
self-confidence. 
  He, with the faith and will of chuche, has built the party 
our own way, built the state by our own faith and developed 
politics, economy and culture our own way. This is why the 
socialism of our country is being built and developed by our 
people's own efforts, not by imitation of other countries nor by 
instructions or pressure of someone, and is making a long drive 
as invincible socialism unshakable and indestructible in any 
political storm of the world. 
  What holds a brilliant place in the great exploits of the 
dear leader is also that he has remarkably strengthened and 
developed the political forces of revolution and the Armed 
Forces. 
  He gave precedence to firmly building the party 
organisationally and ideologically in leading the revolution and 
construction and has strengthened the people's power and 
enhanced its function and role in every way. 
  It is an outstanding exploit of Comrade Kim Chong-il, the 
supreme commander, and a shining fruition of his chuche-based 
military idea and commanding art that he, as a peerless 
brilliant commander, has built up our People's Army into the 
army of the leader, the army of the party whose lifeblood is 
loyalty to the party and the leader and has strengthened and 
developed it into each-a-match-for-a-hundred revolutionary Armed 
Forces capable of defeating any aggressor. 
  What holds a brilliant place in his exploits is also that he 
has established an orderly scientific theory on the inheritance 
and completion of the socialist cause on the basis of the 
revolutionary outlook on the leader and given a steadfast 
continuity to the vitality of our revolution. 
  He defined it as an important task concerning the destiny of 
socialism to correctly resolve the issue of succeeding the 
socialist cause and gave a most correct answer to this by 
studying the course of starting and developing the socialist 
cause with the leader in the center for the first time in 
history, on the basis of his scientific analysis of the 
practical experiences of the Korean revolution and the historic 
lessons of the socialist movement. 
  It is thanks to Comrade Kim Chong-il, an outstanding thinker 
and theoretician produced by mankind that our party has become a 
great party with the immortal guiding idea of the completion of 
the revolutionary cause of chuche, our motherland has become a 
glorious country glorifying the guiding idea of the times 
generation after generation and our people have become a great 
people who are building socialism and communism along a most 
straight road. 
  The reporter in conclusion laid stress on adding shine to 
our-style socialism centering on the popular masses by 
thoroughly implementing the programme for modelling the whole 
society on the chuche idea and upholding with loyalty the idea 
and leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in order 
to reunify the country and accomplish the revolutionary cause of 
chuche.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 9 (KCNA) -- The Central People's 
Committee and the Administration Council of the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea today sent a message of greetings in 
joint name to the international seminar on the chuche idea of 
independent development and mutual cooperation of the world 
people which is due to be held in Kampala. 
  The message says: 
  It is a significant event to hold the international seminar 
on the chuche idea to discuss the question of independent 
development and mutual cooperation of the world people in a 
historical period when independence has become an irresistible 
trend of the times. 
  To dismantle neo-colonialism, the leftover of the old era, 
and achieve complete economic liberation of countries and 
consolidate their political independence is an urgent 
requirement of the present time which is advancing along the 
road of independence and a common task of the peoples of the 
developing countries. 
  The chuche idea is the most humanitarian and democratic idea 
which opposes all manner of domination and subjugation and 
defends human dignity and national sovereignty. It is a genuine 
internationalist idea which requires friendship and cooperation 
among the peoples be strengthened for the common prosperity of 
mankind. 
  The Korean people could build a socialist country, 
independent in politics, self-supporting in the economy and 
self-reliant in national defence, and strengthen the bonds of 
friendship and cooperation with the peoples who champion 
independence as they have regarded the chuche idea as the 
guiding idea in the building of a new society and applied it in 
all domains of social life. 
  There is no doubt that when the people advance under the 
banner of independence and cooperation as required by the chuche 
idea a historical change will be brought about in building a 
free and prosperous new society, a new world. 
  Now the people's cause of justice is undergoing trials due 
to 
the moves of the old forces seeking domination and subjugation, 
but no force on earth can arrest the historical trend of the 
times toward independence, and the aspirations of the people who 
want to live independently would surely be realized. 
  Firmly believing that the seminar will greatly contribute to 
strengthening the independent development and mutual cooperation 
of the world people, we sincerely wish the seminar success in 
its work.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 8 (KCNA) -- Phosphate fertilizer 
producers in Korea are effecting an upswing on the threshold of 
the 30th anniversary of the publication of the rural theses 
(February 25). 
  According to data available, the output of phosphate 
fertilizer in the last ten days was up more than 20 percent from 
the like period of last month. 
  Notably, the Haeju smeltery nearly doubled output by 
operating all equipment at full capacity. 
  The Phungnyon and Yongyu mines which overfulfilled their 
January plans on January 25 are these days producing much more 
phosphorus concentrates than planned.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu by reporter </F>
Kim Cha-su on 8 February -- place not given] 
  [Text] [Kim Cha-su] People in the United States generally 
believe that the strategy to resolve the North Korean nuclear 
issue through dialogue and negotiations has reached its limit. 
  [Han Sung-chu] The U.S. Government has not officially 
stated that the possibility of resolving the North Korean 
nuclear issue is remote. Only the mass media have expressed 
hardline views. The ROK and United States hold that they will 
continue their efforts to resolve the nuclear issue through 
dialogue and that if they fail in their efforts, they will 
examine the possibility of imposing sanctions on North Korea 
through the UN Security Council and other means. 
  [Kim] How will you hold consultations with the United 
States? 
  [Han] The two countries will examine and analyze the 
development of the situation so far. They will also discuss the 
principle on resolving the nuclear issue through dialogue. 
Conditions permitting, they will discuss ways to foster 
cooperation with China, Japan, and other countries concerned. 
  [Kim] Is it possible that the North Korean nuclear issue 
will 
be presented to the UN Security Council? How will our 
government respond then? 
  [Han] It seems inevitable that it will be presented to the 
UN Security Council if no progress were made in the negotiations 
on nuclear inspections before the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] Board of Governors meeting. However, even if the 
issue is presented to the UN Security Council, no decision on 
economic sanctions [kyongjejejae] or other measures will be made 
right away. The government will honor any decision by the UN 
Security Council and positively participate in its 
implementation. 
  [Kim] Do you predict how the international community will 
react if North Korea promises to accept nuclear inspections 
right before the IAEA Board of Governors meeting? 
  [Han] The problem at present is to confirm whether the 
continuity of nuclear safeguards is ensured. Deciding on 
whether the continuity of nuclear safeguards is ensured or not 
is the IAEA's own right, and I think the international community 
will honor the IAEA's decision on this matter. 
  [Kim] It is rumored that North Korean President Kim Il-song 
has failed to correctly perceive the reality concerning the 
nuclear issue. 
  [Han] There is such a rumor or analysis. However, I 
cannot correctly comment because I have had no direct dialogue 
with North Korean policymakers. However, if this were true, it 
is truly worrisome. 
  [Kim] At New York contacts, the United States promised to 
North Korea that it would discontinue the Team Spirit exercise 
and decide on the timing of the third round of North Korea-U.S. 
talks if North Korea accepts nuclear inspections. Is the 
promise still valid? 
  [Han] The agreement at the New York contacts will be valid 
until the IAEA declares the discontinuation of nuclear 
safeguards.

<F P=106> [Article by Kim Chung-kun from Beijing] </F>
  [Text] A notion has been put forth that the Team Spirit 
exercise, an annual ROK-U.S. military exercise, has been very 
effective in checking a North Korean provocation. However, on 
the other hand, it has brought about an adverse effect of 
triggering North Korea to excessively adhere to its nuclear 
development. In other words, this points out that the Team 
Spirit exercise is not always advantageous for the long-term 
security of the Korean peninsula. 
  Such a notion has been brought up not only by the Chinese 
authorities but also by ROK and U.S. officials stationed in 
Beijing. Even though the notion is a minority opinion, it points 
out the need to map out a new view on security to countermeasure 
the changing situation in Northeast Asia. 
  A U.S. official, who has closely watched the North Korean 
situation, said: "Ever since the nuclear issue has come to the 
fore, many discussions and analyses took place among U.S. 
defense and intelligence authorities over the background behind 
North Korea's adherence to the nuclear weapons and the actual 
capability of the North Korean nuclear arms," and added that 
"During the course of those discussions, some believed that the 
Team Spirit exercise, a ROK-U.S. joint exercise simulating 
actual warfare, is not always beneficial to the Korean 
peninsula's security." 
  He then continued saying: "After seeing the United States, a 
super power, staging a three dimensional exercise simulating 
actual warfare staged annually with its main land forces and 
materials, North Korea may have figured out that it must have 
nuclear weapons even it means sacrifice," and pointed out "The 
Kim Il-song group is afraid of the U.S. power since it 
experienced a serious defeat from the United States in the 
Korean war which it provoked." 
  A ROK official, who is well informed of the North Korean 
situation, said: "After the ROK normalized ties with China, it 
gave me a better chance to observe North Korea `more closely' 
via China and, through my observations, I came to realize how 
much North Korea is afraid of the Team Spirit exercise," and 
added that "I think the newly established situation in Northeast 
Asia propels us to think about a regional security group that 
includes North Korea, or at least a type of security that does 
not provoke the other party so as to prevent it from coming out 
with a more fierce counteroffense." 
  The Chinese side has also expressed to the ROK through 
various channels that "As regards to the nuclear issue, the 
biggest stumbling block for China to persuade North Korea is a 
joint military demonstration, such as Team Spirit exercise."

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
editorials and articles published by Seoul vernacular newspapers 
on 9 February on the crisis situation on the Korean peninsula 
concerning North Korea's nuclear issue. 
  The conservative Seoul CHOSON ILBO in Korean publishes on 
page 3 a 1,000-word editorial entitled "Is the Government Making 
Proper Preparations To Cope With the Crisis Situation?" and 
notes the security-related ministers' meeting held in 
Chongwadae, presidential office, on 8 February to discuss North 
Korea's nuclear issue. The editorial summarizes the three main 
points of the meeting: One, if the United Nations impose 
sanctions against North Korea in the event no agreement is 
reached on nuclear inspections, our government will support the 
sanctions; two, our government will make constant efforts to 
hold dialogue with North Korea; and three, the current situation 
on the Korean peninsula is causing a degree of uneasiness among 
the people. The editorial notes: "What is clear at present is 
that there are more things we are not aware of than things we 
are aware of in connection with the security situation on the 
Korean peninsula. We are not aware of the degree of North 
Korea's nuclear weapon development and we do not know how it 
will use its nuclear card in the future." Noting the recent 
U.S. media reports about the tension on the Korean peninsula, 
the article stresses: "We should constantly review in a 
multilateral way our security situation and map out a policy to 
maintain security." The editorial notes the likelihood that 
because North Korea is aware of its limits in negotiations with 
the United States, it will participate in North-South dialogue. 
The editorial concludes that the government should take 
measures to prepare for the resumption of North-South dialogue. 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 a 
1,000-word editorial entitled "Security Meeting and People's 
Attention," and notes the people's desire that "North Korea's 
nuclear development should be prevented without fail. However, 
the issue of preventing North Korea from developing nuclear 
weapons should be resolved peacefully and any unfortunate 
situation should be avoided." The editorial quotes President 
Kim Yong-sam as saying at the security-related ministers' 
meeting: "North Korea's nuclear issue is facing a grave crisis 
because of dissension between North Korea and the International 
Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, over inspection methods. Even 
though the situation on the Korean peninsula is not in a state 
of crisis situation at the moment, the cabinet should take 
multilateral measures against a sudden difficulty." Regarding 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's visit to the United States, the 
editorial reports: "He should persuade the U.S. Administration 
to understand our will to resolve peacefully North Korea's 
nuclear issue. He should negotiate a method with the U.S. 
Administration to get North Korea to accept nuclear 
inspections." The editorial notes the importance of the 
government's efforts to resolve diplomatically North Korea's 
nuclear issue even after North Korea's nuclear issue is referred 
to the UN Security Council. The editorial notes the people feel 
uneasy about the situation on the Korean peninsula because the 
government has remained silent about the spreading crisis 
situation on the Korean peninsula. The editorial concludes: "It 
is important to resolve peacefully North Korea's nuclear issue 
before it enters a grave stage and to implement a policy to cope 
with a worst case scenario. The government should not forget, 
however, that they should inform the people of the status of 
negotiations with the North, the trends in North Korea, and the 
situation on the Korean peninsula. By so doing, the government 
should seek the people's cooperation through consensus." 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN in Korean publishes on page 3 
a 1,000-word editorial entitled "The Government Should Make the 
People Feel Relieved" and notes recent foreign press reports 
that tensions have been heightened on the Korean peninsula. The 
editorial cites the security-related ministers' meeting held on 
8 February as deciding: "The current situation on the Korean 
peninsula cannot be regarded as a crisis situation. Even though 
North Korea's defensive drills and strengthening of underground 
military facilities have been observed, there is no sign of an 
immediate military provocation." The editorial continues: "It 
is urgent that the government should dissipate the people's 
sense of uneasiness about our security situation on the Korean 
peninsula. The government should, above all, encourage the 
people to engage in their work without worrying about security 
because misunderstandings and rumors of a groundless crisis 
situation could result in considerable economic and social 
damage." The editorial urges the government to analyze closely 
North Korea's situation and inform the people of North Korea's 
trends. The editorial concludes: "It is necessary for the 
government to make efforts to strengthen the ROK-U.S. security 
cooperative system and to frequently inform the people and 
foreign enterprises of the government's policy toward the North. 
By so doing, the government will create an atmosphere for the 
people and foreign enterprises to work without uneasiness." 
  The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN in Korean publishes on page 
3 a 1,200-word article by Pak Chong-mun noting "the emergence of 
the pessimistic opinion that North Korea's nuclear issue is 
rushing toward a catastrophe regardless of one or two relevant 
authorities' desire to control the nuclear issue." The article 
summarizes "objective circumstantial factors about North Korea's 
nuclear issue as follows: It is highly likely that North Korea 
will not accept IAEA full-scale inspections in the future. If 
North Korea does not give a positive answer about nuclear 
inspections by 21 February when the regular meeting of the IAEA 
Board of Governors is expected to be held, the IAEA plans to 
report North Korea's noncompliance with obligatory inspections 
[uimusachal] to the UN Security Council; and the ROK and the 
United States will no longer be able to seek negotiations with 
North Korea." The article notes the IAEA and the United 
Nations, the ROK, the United States, Japan, and China are put 
into a difficult position because of objective circumstantial 
factors. After elaborating on the ROK-U.S. position on North 
Korea's nuclear issue, the article notes China's position: 
"China is facing a difficult position in that it can neither 
veto nor favor the U.S.-led resolution on sanctions against 
North Korea. To avoid the current circumstances, China seems to 
be making every effort to persuade North Korea." Regarding 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's visit to the United States, the 
article reports that "considering the fact that Minister Han has 
left for the United States approximately one week ahead of 
schedule, there seems to be reasons other than the Foreign 
Ministry's explanation."

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 8 (YONHAP) -- Kim Tae-chung, chairman 
of the Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation, on Tuesday suggested that 
the United States lay down a package proposal to North Korea to 
resolve the controversial North Korean nuclear issues. 
  While meeting with reporters at Kimpo Airport upon his 
return 
from a visit to three Nordic countries, Kim said he believes 
North Korea would accept it if the United States, in concert 
with China, persuades North Korea over a package deal. 
  Kim stressed that the nuclear question should be resolved at 
an early date before it is referred to the U.N. Security Council. 
  The former opposition leader also said that if a war recurs 
on the Korean peninsula, it would deal a tremendous damage to 
the 70 million Korean people. 
  Referring to the idea of taking Pyongyang in a war, which 
was 
recently voiced by a senior U.S. Administration official, Kim 
said, "We must cooperate with the United States in areas where 
we should, but the United States ought to be more prudent over 
matters like this."

  [Text] In a report from Bangkok, Japan's SANKEI SHIMBUN 
reported on 8 February that North Korea, which has been 
denounced internationally for its alleged nuclear development, 
has persistently asked Thailand, the chairman state of ASEAN, to 
permit its participation in an ASEAN regional forum to be held 
in July in Bangkok. 
  The newspaper quoted a Western source in Thailand. The 
newspaper added: North Korean participation in the forum will 
not be possible due to fierce opposition from the United States 
and other countries. North Korea wants to participate in the 
forum because it is uneasy with the fact that it is excluded 
from the "Asian security framework."

  [Text] Beijing, Feb. 8 (YONHAP) -- North Korea is moving 
secretly to build a memorial hall for President Kim Il-song 
after his death modeled after the Mao Zedong Memorial Hall in 
China, a source close to Pyongyang said on Tuesday. The North 
Koreans are paying special attention to making a large 
waterproof glass coffin which will preserve Kim's body in the 
hall's mausoleum, he added. The glass coffin will be 10 meters 
long and 10 meters wide, and kept in an underground mausoleum 30 
meters deep for permanent preservation of Kim's body, which will 
automatically rise to the ground for public displays. 
  To prevent the body from decaying, the coffin will be placed 
five to six meters from the walls of the mausoleum, the source 
said. In October last year, eight North Koreans secretly 
visited Beijing to meet five Chinese technicians who took part 
in making the glass coffin for the late Mao Zedong. 
  North Korea is using Chokwang Trading Co. in Macao, one of 
its foreign trade bases in Asia, to procure the materials needed 
in the mausoleum and glass coffin such as wood, special steel 
plates, copper pipes and marble, he said. Last October and in 
early February, Korea Taesong Trading Co., one of North Korea's 
leading trading houses in Pyongyang, contacted a building 
supplies firm in Hong kong while opening a letter of credit for 
300,000 U.S. dollars to purchase the materials, he added. 
  Negotiations with the Hong Kong firm are proceeding smoothly 
and if its initial shipment to the port of Hungnam in North 
Korea is successful, there will be second and third shipments 
from the firm, he said.

  [Text] South Korea will hold crucial bilateral meetings on 
telecommunications issues with China and the United States, the 
first since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round negotiations of 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  On one hand, the meeting with China could broaden South 
Korea's participation in the modernization of its 
telecommunications network while that with the U.S. could signal 
the beginning of pressure for greater domestic market opening. 
  Communications Ministry officials said one of the critical 
aspects of the meetings is that they are both being held on 
foreign soil, tomorrow and Thursday and Thursday and Friday in 
Beijing and Washington respectively. 
  The officials said yesterday that the working level meeting 
with China will place primary emphasis on the trial operation of 
Korean-made TDX-10 (time division exchange-10) switching systems 
in China. 
  China's Ministry of Telecommunications and Posts has yet to 
approve the testing of the TDX systems in the modernization of 
their telecommunications network and the meeting is expected to 
iron out outstanding issues, the officials said. 
  The Chinese telecommunications market represents one of the 
most lucrative in the world and a number of Korean companies are 
already operating there in joint ventures to produce switching 
machines. 
  Led by No Hui-to, the ministry's director of 
telecommunications promotion, the meeting is mainly a follow up 
on last year's ministerial meetings in Beijing and Seoul and 
will also include talks on the agenda for the next high level 
meeting. 
  Among other issues to be put on the table in Beijing later 
this week are the scope and timing for joint research and 
conditions for engaging in joint investments, the officials 
explained. 
  In Washington, the primary concern will be on examining the 
two countries' conformance to the record of understanding (ROU) 
concluded in February 1992 which outlined the liberalization of 
the Korean market to American companies. 
  As a direct result of the stipulations of the ROU, AT&amp;T 
qualified to bid in the government's open procurement bidding 
last August and took home over 17 percent of the switching 
systems to be installed this year. 
  The meeting, the fourth to be held since the conclusion of 
the ROU, will be represented by Yim Chong-sin, head of the 
ministry's telecommunications cooperation commission, and Peter 
Collins, deputy assistant U.S. trade representative. 
  The ministry officials said the basic purpose of the meeting 
is to evaluate the extent to which the two sides have been 
abiding by the contents of the ROU but could prove to be a forum 
for the U.S. to exert pressure for further and accelerated 
opening of the Korean market. 
  In the previous meeting in Seoul last October, the U.S. 
representatives expressed strong interested in the participation 
of U.S. companies in the lucrative second cellular telephone 
project, the license for which is due to be awarded sometime in 
the first half of this year.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 8 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and China 
have agreed to boost science and technology cooperation by 
exchanging post-doctoral researchers. 
  The two sides signed a memorandum on a training program for 
science and technology post-doctorates at the first working 
meeting of the Sino-Korean Science and Technology Cooperation 
Committee on Feb. 4-5 in Beijing, a spokesman for the Korean 
delegation said Tuesday. 
  Under the agreement, 15 designated scientists and engineers 
from each side will be exchanged for one year of training to 
learn in areas where one side is more advanced than the other, 
the spokesman said. 
  Candidates at the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation 
are currently being screened: Once chosen, they will begin 
their studies in China from July this year. 
  The Chinese have already sent a list of 20 candidates, 15 of 
whom will start the fellowship program here in April. 
  The working committee also agreed to hold an exhibition on 
the advanced Chinese technologies displayed jointly by the city 
governments of Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin at the KOEX (Korea 
Exhibition Center) in October. 
  Twenty researchers will be exchanged annually for four years 
from 1994 and joint research projects will be increased to 10 
from the current two, the spokesman said. 
  A Korea-China Science and Technology Cooperation Center will 
be set up in Seoul sometime in the second half of the year.

<F P=106> [Article by National Speaker Yi Man-sop on his China trip] </F>
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] China clearly perceives South 
Korea as a trust-worthy economic partner. 
  This belief is based on the judgment that when China's human 
and material resources and the ROK's capital and experience in 
economic development are combined, it will produce greater 
effects than any other tie-up. 
  This does not mean that China is looking at us only from the 
point of view of its economic interests. The historical and 
traditional friendship forged over thousands of years cannot be 
explained only in terms of "national interest" adhered to by the 
distant West. Deeply embedded in the Sino-Korea relationship are 
the special affinity and bonds forged unconsciously. 
  During my short 3-day stay in Beijing, I was able to meet 
with all the three top leaders who are building a "new China," 
namely, Jiang Zemin, Qiao Shi, and Li Peng. Deng Pufang, 
chairman of the Association of the Handicapped, came up to 
Beijing from Shanghai, where he was looking after the paramount 
leader Deng Xiaoping who was wintering there, to pay me a 
courtesy call at Diayutai. Zu Liang, chairman of the NPC Foreign 
Affairs Committee, accompanied me during my entire 6-night, 
7-day China itinerary. All this hospitality exceeding the 
customary protocol should be understood in the context of the 
special friendship between the two countries based on the 
affinity mentioned above. [passage omitted] 
  I stressed to Jiang Zemin and other leaders that of the 
three 
elements of "arms, food, and trust" as referred to by Confucius, 
trust is most important, and that the two peoples should carry 
out exchanges open-mindedly trusting each other by "showing 
utter devotion to a friend" as the saying goes. [passage omitted] 
  China is more prepared than we are for economic cooperation 
between our two countries. 
  During the hour-long candidate dialogue, Chairman Jiang said 
he would take personal charge of economic cooperation, 
mentioning specific interests such as the automobile, 
electronic, and semiconductor sectors. Zao Qisheng, Shanghai 
deputy mayor, said that he personally explained the "Pudong New 
District" development plan to Korean businessmen when they 
visited Shanghai at his invitation. 
  We are now seeking internationalization and futuristic 
progress as our national goal. Through my recent visit I could 
confirm that China is our most important cooperative partner, 
given the present state of the North-South relationship. 
  During our visit to China, we, the National Assembly 
delegation, keenly realized that this is the time for our 
politicians and businessmen to pool their wisdom and 
resourcefulness for the sake of national development rather than 
wasting time and energy paying lip service to globalization and 
doing unproductive things. 
  In this sense it is of great significance that our National 
Assembly delegation, which included DP Secretary General Kim 
Tae-sik and other ruling and opposition party politicians, 
visited China at the outset of the new year which is dedicated 
to nationalization and opening. We firmly believe that our 
recent visit to China will add momentum to bringing about more 
brisk exchanges and a higher level of cooperation between our 
two countries. 
  The immense and friendly frontier called China is beckoning 
to us with open arms.

  [Text] Inchon, Feb. 8 (YONHAP) -- A belated memorial 
service for the Russian sailors fallen in the Russo-Japanese war 
in 1904 was observed on Tuesday in the sea off this harbor city 
of Inchon. 
  Ambassador Georgiy Kunadze and four other Russian Embassy 
officials sailed to the scene of the sinking of two Russian gun 
boats near Sowolmi-do Island aboard a maritime police patrol 
ship at 2 pm to observe the service. 
  The two Russian ships, 6,500-ton Variak and 1,200-ton 
Koryeth, were sunk in a battle with six Japanese warships on 
Feb. 9, 1904, one day after the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese 
war. 
  The Russian vessels were in the Inchon harbor at that time 
to 
protect the Russian legation in Seoul. 
  Sixty-four wounded sailors of the two ships were evacuated 
to 
nearby English, French and Italian vessels. But, the remainders 
went down with their vessels as they sank their ships rather 
than to surrender to the Japanese. 
  Earlier in the day, Ambassador Kunadze and his party called 
at the Inchon City Hall and discussed with Mayor Choe Ki-son 
ways to promote exchanges and cooperation between Inchon and 
Russian cities.

<F P=106> [Article by Song Yong-on] </F>
  [Excerpts] People often say that President Kim is a 
"political pro of the 10th grade." They mean to say that he has 
an outstanding ability to make political maneuvers and 
breakthroughs that baffle the imagination. He changed direction 
by suddenly announcing during his New Year's press conference 
the postponement of the DLP convention originally scheduled for 
May, and subsequently on 10 January hosting a luncheon in honor 
of the three former presidents. 
  Where did the president get his idea of bringing abut a 
turnaround in the political situation? His intimates unanimously 
point out that it was his own well thought-out idea. If so, is 
he a person who won't listen to others? [passage omitted] 
  In the process of adapting a political decision or selecting 
personnel, President Kim widely utilizes public and private 
channels. What he uses most is telephone conversation. In fact, 
he avails himself of every opportunity to make phone calls to 
many people to hear their opinions on various matters. He meets 
some of them in person, although the frequency of such meetings 
has decreased since he moved into the Blue House. 
  Said an official concerned: "President Kim seems to feel 
that 
overdependence on information furnished by official agencies 
might cause information overload and that there is a limit to 
his ability to listen to the public through these channels. 
That is why he is in all ears to listen to opinions from all 
sources." [passage omitted] 
  The president often makes the calls himself so that even his 
secretaries are kept in the dark. Mostly he does so between the 
end of the 2100 TV newscast and bedtime. When he moved into the 
Blue House, he carried with him his personal telephone book that 
he had kept when he lived in Sangdo-tong. Listed here, titled 
"Telephone Reference," are the names and numbers of more than 
800 persons, including those who are not well-known, such as his 
classmates, hometown friends, those he contacted during his days 
in the opposition, restaurant owners, etc. The list also 
includes many of opinion makers in the economic, judicial, and 
academic communities. [passage omitted] 
  Said an official: "President Kim has become acquainted with 
a 
surprisingly large number of people since he entered politics 
some 40 years ago. Valuing his ties with these people highly, 
he calls them up or meets them from time to time to hear their 
opinions on a wide range of issues." He calls just to say hello 
sometimes or to hear about the trend of public opinion. 
  When he discusses policy matters in the economic, judicial, 
and academic circles, he hears a lot. Prominent among those in 
the business community with whom Kim often consults are: Ku 
Pyong-hoe, chairman of Lucky-Goldstar; Kim Sang-ha, chairman of 
Samyang Co.; Kim Ung-se, president of Lotte World; Sin Kyok-ho, 
chairman of the Lotte Group, and Pak Yong-hak, chairman of the 
Taenong group. Lotte World President Kim is the father-in-law of 
President Kim's second son, Hyon Chol. 
  In the academic community Kim consults with: Professors Pae 
Chae-sik, Yi Kak-pom, Yi Myong-hyon, and Yi Su-song at Seoul 
University; Professor Pak Yong-sik (former president) of Yonsei 
University; Professor Kim Kye-su of the University of Foreign 
Studies; Professor Mun Pyong-chip (former president) of Chungang 
University; and Professors Ha Tok-mo and So Chae-kin of Tongguk 
University. 
  Professor Pae was President Kim's classmate at Kyongnam High 
School. President Kim often calls members of "Samsuhoe," an 
alumni organization of Kyongnam High School. Reportedly, he met 
them once in a group. The membership of Samsuhoe is about 80, 
some of whom live in Pusan. In the judicial circles the 
president consults with: Attorneys Kim Yun-to, Kim Hong-su, and 
Mun In-ku. 
  The president also seeks opinions from many in the military. 
Last spring while discussing the 12 December [1979] incident, 
Kim said, "I recently met with Gen. Chong Sung-hwa." 
  A source close to President Kim said: "He got acquainted 
with 
many in the military because he himself served in the National 
Assembly Defense Committee for many years when he was an 
Assembly member. He seems to seek opinions from many military 
figures, regardless of whether they are in uniform or on the 
reserve list or in civvies." 
  There is one person whom we cannot omit when discussing 
Kim's 
private channels of communication. That is Hyon Chol, his 
second son. He is currently taking a doctorate course at Koryo 
University. It is said that he presents candid opinions to his 
father on a wide range of issues. 
  In the December government and party reshuffle, including 
the 
replacement of Blue House senior secretaries, some belonging to 
the Sangdo-tong inner circle were appointed. Some observers 
attribute this to Hyon Chol's influence. 
  Chon Pyong-min and Yi Chung-pom are said to be assisting Kim 
Hyon-chol. Shortly before the new Administration, Chon was 
tentatively chosen for Kim's senior secretary for policy affairs 
but was later struck from the list. Yi, on the other hand, 
formerly served as Blue House secretary for executive oversight, 
but resigned because of the controversy over the lawyer's 
retainer.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Choe Kyu-sik] </F>
  [Excerpts] One of the few prominent politicians who have 
been continually in the limelight since the inauguration of the 
Kim Yong-sam administration is Blue House Secretary General Pak 
Kwan-yong. His emergence in the limelight is particularly 
conspicuous because he does not belong to the Sangdo-tong inner 
circle, the center of power. He consolidated his position during 
the reshuffle of the ruling hierarchy late last year which 
reaffirmed President Kim's abiding trust in him. The reshuffle 
was aimed at strengthening President Kim's governing in person 
and placing people in the Sangdo-tong inner circle in key 
positions. [passage omitted] 
  It is said that it was none other Pak who advised Kim to set 
the strengthening of international competitiveness as the 
foremost goal of state administration in the new year and to use 
this goal as the cardinal criterion in selecting a new Cabinet. 
He was not directly involved in the reshuffle of the government 
and the party. Nevertheless, it is a common belief that he was 
virtually the only one whom President Kim consulted. 
  Early this year Pak completed the reorganization of the 
presidential secretariat to assist the president more 
effectively in his second year of office, although the 
reorganization fell short of his original intentions. The 
reorganization will now free him to concentrate more on his 
advisory role. 
  Unlike other veteran politicians in their fourth term in the 
National Assembly, Pak has his own views on a wide range of 
issues such as the unification issue and is reputed to be a 
very rational and resilient person. Yet "not exceeding the 
bounds" and knowing his place are the better known ingredients 
in his character. 
  According to Blue House sources, Pak bore himself with 
dignity in the past year despite his not belonging to the 
Sangdo-tong inner circles, and his deportment must have given 
President Kim a strong impression. In taking control of state 
affairs in the early stage of his term in office, President Kim 
may have found it necessary to choose as his Blue House 
secretary general a person from whom he should keep a certain 
"distance" rather than one of his retainer group whom he could 
address by his first name except in public. 
  Pak's modest personality and smooth human relations played a 
significant part in travelling the political road without a 
hitch. He is on intimate terms with Yi Won-chon, Blue House 
senior secretary for political affairs, who belongs to the 
Sangdo-tong inner circle. [passage omitted] 
  Pak also has a friendly relationship with Hong In-kil, Blue 
House senior secretary for general affairs, who belongs to the 
Sangdo-tong inner circle. The two have worked together in the 
Blue House in the past year. Of course, Hong is courteous to 
Pak, his college senior, and plays the role of a "protective 
shield" for him. 
  Clearly, Pak has become one of the handful of important 
"pillars" which President Kim can use. As Kim's perception of 
statecraft improves, he might need late this year or early next 
year a secretary general who is more of a manager than a 
political adviser, and it might become possible for him to 
appoint former Assemblyman So Sok-chae. Even in that event, it 
is generally speculated, Pak would be found "more useful" in 
some other capacity. 
  One of those who know Pak well said: "It is a lie to say 
that 
politicians have no ambition. As far as Secretary General Pak is 
concerned, quiet deportment has become a habit." It is said that 
Pak sometimes hesitates to tell things straight to the president 
or the intensity of his advise is somewhat weak. But Blue House 
officials said, "a true adviser's role is to act quietly to 
make an opening for solving an outstanding issue."

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 7 (YONHAP) -- South Korean 
Information Minister O In-hwan says that the second phase of 
President Kim Yong-sam's reforms calls for a resolute drive to 
internationalize Korea. After the first reform phase, which was 
aimed at rationalizing and normalizing the political, social and 
economic sectors, O said South Korea must boost its competitive 
strength through internationalization. 
  Speaking at a meeting of heads of South Korean overseas 
information services in the United States, O said, "We have to 
awaken the potential capacity and possibility of every field and 
deploy all our energy so that we can mount a challenge on the 
world stage." 
  "Heightening the image of our country by letting the world 
know about the dynamic reforms of our civilian government and 
cultural tradition is the way to raise the status of the country 
and strengthen competitiveness," he said. 
  In order to achieve this goal, O said the government plans 
to 
build up a joint official and private promotion system, partly 
by channeling publicity functions that are scattered among 
various ministries. 
  The heads of the overseas information services heard reports 
on internationalization and the country's competitiveness, and 
exchanged views at the meeting. 
  Prior to coming to Washington, O presided over similar 
meetings in Tokyo and Paris. He is scheduled to return home via 
New York on Sunday.

  [Text] The government announced yesterday it will raise 
the special excise tax rates on gasoline, diesel oil and 
kerosene from 10-150 percent to 13-190 percent from February 15 
in a move to generate revenue to finance the modernization of 
social infrastructure such as subways, roads and ports. 
  The tax rate for gasoline, diesel oil and kerosene will rise 
to 190 percent, 25 percent and 13 percent, respectively, from 
the current 150 percent, 20 percent and 10 percent, the Ministry 
of Finance announced following a meeting of economic vice 
ministers yesterday. 
  The tax rate hike will offset a reduction in oil prices 
which 
was announced by the government, which will link domestic oil 
prices to international prices. 
  The Trade-Industry-Energy Ministry said last week that 
consumers can enjoy a reduction in oil prices by 4-5 percent 
from February 15. 
  International oil prices fell to 12.85 dollars per barrel in 
January this year from 15.81 dollars per barrel last year. 
  As international oil prices fall, the government estimates 
that its "transportation tax," which was introduced this year to 
finance the modernization and expansion of social overhead 
capital (SOC) projects, will be down by more than 600 billion 
won this year from the original target. 
  The government set the tax base at 15.81 dollars per barrel 
for a collection of 3.2 trillion won in transportation tax this 
year, out of which 2.6 trillion won will come from the tax on 
gasoline. 
  But as international oil prices fell, the tax base also 
fell. 
Thus, the MOF said the government decided to raise the tax rate 
on the three key oil prices. The end result is that drivers 
must buy gasoline at the current price of around 610 won per 
litter even after the government links the domestic oil retail 
price to international fluctuations from the middle of this 
month. 
  The government has been under fire for "arbitrarily" raising 
tax rates or implementing a new tax without full debate at the 
National Assembly or through public hearings. 
  Last month, it announced plans to collect 1.5 trillion won 
each year for the next 10 years to finance the rural sector, at 
the instruction of President Kim Yong-sam. 
  The government also suddenly announced yesterday that it 
will 
raise the special excise tax rates on major oil products.

  [Text] The government will promote an envisioned 
medium-sized (50 to 100 seat) commuter aircraft development 
program through international cooperation rather than with 
Korean firms alone. 
  The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) said 
yesterday such actors as the technological level of the domestic 
aerospace industry and access to the world market after 
development have led it to opt for international cooperation 
instead of a purely Korean effort. But when international 
cooperation is hard to come by, the ministry said, Korean firms 
will have to work on their own after introducing foreign 
technology. 
  The ministry also said the prototype aircraft will be 
developed by a consortium comprising all three Korean aircraft 
assemblers--Samsung Aerospace Industries, Daewoo Heavy 
Industries and Korean Air. This decision goes against Samsung's 
insistence that the development program be carried out by one 
single prime contractor to ensure control of the whole program. 
  The consortium, however, will be led by one company. To 
select it, the ministry will soon form a committee, which will 
map out criteria for the leading firm and send request for 
proposals (RFP) to the three candidates. 
  The ministry's decision, following advice by the Korea 
Aerospace Research Institute (KARI), has put the three firms in 
fierce competition to gain designation as the leading company. 
The final selection is expected to be made in May this year. 
  The consortium, after being formed, will seek participation 
from advanced foreign companies into the Korean commuter 
development program. 
  The ministry will leave it to the consortium to decide on 
how 
large the envisaged aircraft should be. Originally, it planned 
to develop a 50-seat commuter craft, but Daewoo and KAL opposed 
the idea on the grounds that a 50-seat aircraft would not be 
profitable. 
  The government plans to complete the development program by 
1998 at an estimated cost of 279 billion won (about $344 
million). Over half of the cost will be shouldered by the 
government. 
  The development program will be promoted in four 
divisions--overall management, aircraft development, design 
verification and certification. Except for the actual 
development work, other jobs will be handled by relevant 
professional research organizations, the ministry said. 
  The ministry intends to finalize its development plan in 
March after acquiring endorsement from the deliberation 
committee on aerospace industry development. 
  The medium-sized commuter development program is part of the 
government efforts to foster the domestic aerospace industry. 
By developing an exportable commuter, it intends to secure core 
aircraft design and testing technology, put the industry on a 
solid growth path and reduce deficits in the nation's aircraft 
manufacturers. 
  According to a report by KARI, the international 
medium-sized 
commuter industry, unlike the large aircraft (over 100 seats) 
industry, is not dominated by an oligopoly, implying that entry 
by Korea will not be difficult. 
  The institute forecast that the break-even point for Korea 
will be about 180 aircraft. The ministry expects that by 2010, 
Korea will have a domestic demand of 170 medium-sized commuters. 
by then, it hopes,the domestic aerospace industry will also be 
able to export 50 to 100 commuter aircraft.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 8 (YONHAP) -- The Seoul prosecution on 
Tuesday placed under arrest two executives of Korea Automobile 
Fire and Marine Insurance Co. on perjury and graft charges. 
  The two were Yi Chang-sik and Pak Chang-kwang. 
  The prosecution charged that the two, acting on instructions 
from their company president, tried to bribe Rep. Kim Mal-yong 
of the Democratic Party with money. However, they falsely 
testified at an Assembly Labor Committee session on last Jan. 
27 that they did not seek to hand an envelop containing money 
to Rep. Kim, the prosecution said. 
  Meanwhile, the Seoul area Labor Administration Office 
announced Tuesday it had decided to take legal actions against 
Pak Chang-kwang and 13 other officials and employees of Korea 
Automobile Fire and Marine Insurance Co. on charges of engaging 
in undue labor activities. 
  An investigation based on a complaint filed by the labor 
union of the insurance firm indicated that the 14 people had 
tried to control and interfere in labor activities of the firm's 
union, the labor office said. 
  By law a person found guilty of undue labor activities is to 
be sentenced to a prison term not exceeding one year or to a 
fine of 15 million won.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Sin Yong-pae] </F>
  [Text] The ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) has been 
disturbed by talk ahead of the parliamentary election in 1996 
about a possible large-scale replacement of old-guard 
politicians with young newcomers. Particularly, older 
politicians within the DLP, who garnished political favors from 
previous governments, fear that they may be excluded from party 
nominations of candidates for the National Assembly. 
  The possibility of wholesale replacements was raised at the 
end of last month when DLP Secretary-General Mun Chong-su 
indicated that the party will push for a generational change in 
the party line-up on a gradual basis. In a report on party 
policies for 1994 to President Kim Yong-sam, Mun said he will 
try to keep the party from aging by recruiting more young 
people. He also pointed out that the number of DLP lawmakers in 
their 50s or 60s will make up nearly 90 percent of the party in 
1996. As a matter of fact, the need for personnel changes within 
the DLP has been discussed continuously in hushed tones among 
reform-minded party lawmakers since the inauguration of the Kim 
government on a mandate of change and reform early last year. 
They are said to have been displeased with the failure by their 
party to show teamwork in carrying out in-house reform measures 
because of intraparty factional divisions. 
  The DLP, a product of a three-party merger in 1990, consists 
of three factions with different political ideologies and 
backgrounds. Mun's suggestion for a generational change was in 
line with President Kim's recent call for a transfusion of 
"young blood" into the DLP through the nomination of reformist 
candidates for the general elections. Kim, who is also the party 
president, said old- fashioned politicians who have failed to 
adapt themselves to the new times will gradually disappear from 
the political community. 
  As the DLP leaders have raised the nomination issue earlier 
than expected, speculation has persisted that more than 50 
percent of the current DLP lawmakers will be dropped in the 
selection of party candidates for the Assembly elections. Party 
insiders predict that the expected rejectees will be those who 
are old and lack reform zeal, and who have been targets of 
public criticism for their accumulation of wealth in an illegal 
or immoral way. But the controversial DLP move to infuse "young 
blood" into the party has drawn a reaction from old politicians 
within the DLP, mainly from the party's two conservative 
factions. 
  Displeasure with the move to replace old politicians with 
young newcomers erupted during a meeting of party advisers, who 
are senior politicians, early this month. They argued that it is 
wrong to allege that old politicians should retire only because 
they are old. 
  DLP Chairman Kim Chong-pil, a symbol of the old-fashioned 
politician, was not enthusiastic about the prospect of personnel 
changes. He said he is willing to push for a generational change 
but noted it is desirable that the experience of the old and the 
vigor of the young are harmonized in politics. 
  The dispute surrounding replacement of old politicians with 
young newcomers has already intensified conflicts between 
factions within the DLP. The two conservative groups have been 
uneasy over the possibility of personnel changes. They said the 
move was engineered by their rival reform-minded faction made up 
of relatively young politicians in order to grab party hegemony. 
But the reformists, loyal to President Kim, stressed the need 
for a large-scale replacement of old politicians with young 
reformists, saying that party candidates for the general 
elections should be fresh figures befitting the new era of 
reform.

  [Text] Some political analysts recently made a shocking 
prediction that the main opposition Democratic Party (DP) would 
suffer from serious in-house factional conflicts in the not too 
distant future. They based their pessimistic view on the 
complexity of an emerging power struggle within the DP. 
  Party Chairman Yi Ki-taek does not appear to be firm in his 
leadership these days. In addition, the DP appears to be split, 
apparent even to outsiders. 
  The struggle for the party leadership was triggered by Yi's 
announcement early last month that he will run in the 1997 
presidential election. Yi's declaration immediately brought a 
bellicose response from his political rivals who think Yi is not 
a man of real presidential timber. "The public approval rate for 
the DP has stood at just 18 percent," said a DP lawmaker. 
"Unless the party makes a drastic change in its leadership, the 
transfer of power to the DP will be impossible," he said. 
  Yi currently chairs the party's top decision-making body, 
the 
Supreme Council, that consists of nine senior lawmakers. But his 
leadership is described as shaky. He obtained slightly more than 
50 percent of the vote in March last year when he was elected 
party chairman. Furthermore, just 31 of the DP's 97 lawmakers 
belong to the faction led by Yi. Another group of 43 lawmakers, 
which had been led by former DP leader Kim Tae-chung, is 
considered friendly to Yi but has not clearly come out in 
support of him. And as many as 55 lawmakers, including those 
who have dual factional membership, are members of the 
anti-mainstream group led by Reps. Kim Sang-hyon, Chong 
Tae-chol, Kim Won-ki, and Yi Pu-yong. 
  Chairman Yi has acted like a presidential candidate since 
his 
formal announcement that he will run for the presidency last 
month, exposing himself to criticism. Experts interpreted Yi's 
plan to meet with North Korean President Kim Il-song in 
Pyongyang as part of his efforts to realize his presidential 
ambitions. Almost all his public activities seem to be aimed at 
boosting his political and popular image. Yi has expanded his 
private political organization, called the Unification Research 
Center, by establishing local chapters across the nation. He met 
with prominent business and religious leaders, including 
Cardinal Stephen Kim So-hwan, environmental scholars and people 
from almost all sectors of society. The DP leader also visited 
market places, farming villages, police stations and homes for 
the underprivileged in a bid to take a first-hand look at the 
lives of ordinary people. 
  Meanwhile, Yi's extraordinarily visible behavior has begun 
to 
stimulate his opponents and rivals to work out countermeasures. 
A group of 20 reform-minded DP lawmakers held an emergency 
meeting Jan. 28-29 and called for a change in the party 
leadership. Saying that Chairman Yi is too weak for the DP's 
presidential bid, they demanded that the party's national 
convention be held ahead of schedule during this year. The 
national convention, in which the party chairman will be 
elected, is scheduled for May next year. 
  Rep. Yi Pu-yong said at the meeting that he will run for the 
party chairmanship, if 80 percent of his group members support 
his candidacy. Reps. Kim Sang-hyon and Chong Tae-chol, who were 
defeated by Chairman Yi in the party leadership race last year, 
came out firmly in support of the reform-minded lawmakers' 
demand. Kim and Chong also made their own efforts to widen their 
political influence in the opposition camp. 
  Kim recently visited Japan and the Philippines along with 
his 
supporters and has made many contacts with other factional 
leaders in order to form a united front against Chairman Yi. In 
May, Kim and Chong plan to visit China, where they will meet 
with political leaders in Beijing and hold seminars. 
  "The DP needs a new face. The incumbent chairman is clearly 
unqualified to compete in the presidential race," said a 
lawmaker who belongs to the Kim Sang-hyon faction. Yi's camp 
reacted to the views of his opponents by insisting that it is 
impossible to find a clear alternative to Yi's chairmanship. 
  Though their is obviously some tendency to break away from 
the influence of Kim Tae-chung in the DP, both mainstream and 
anti-mainstream factions are striving to secure Kim's support in 
the race for the party leadership. Since his inauguration as 
party chairman last year, Yi has made desperate efforts to fill 
the political vacuum left by Kim's retirement from politics in 
December 1992. Yi ha sought closer ties with the 43-member DP 
faction formerly led by Kim. The chairman has also made efforts 
to merge with splinter opposition parties to broaden his 
political base. Yi's political status has somewhat improved 
thanks to his efforts so far but he has yet to overcome the 
widespread skepticism over his ability as party leader as well 
as his calibre as a presidential candidate.

<F P=106> [By reporter Hong Chun-ho: "Is the KTC-YKT `Alliance' </F>
Working All Right? -- a Subtle Shifting of Current in the DP 
Power Dynamics"] 
  [Excerpts] The Democratic Party [DP] has been operating by 
an alliance between former Chairman Kim Tae-chung [KTC] and 
present Chairman Yi Ki-taek [YKT]. More specifically, the YKT 
leadership came into being thanks to the tacit support of KTC 
who had just retired from first-line politics. And even today it 
is difficult to explain its existence minus that factor. 
  Needless to say, KTC is a retiree from politics. He himself 
reaffirmed it publicly on many occasions. But the fact is that 
even though he retired from active politics, it does not mean 
that his influence has also been "retired." This fact was 
verified more than once. KTC remains a member of the DP and, 
more importantly, all his men are in good shape in the DP. 
[passage omitted] 
  According to the party Constitution, the next DP national 
convention is to be held in May 1995; however, in the event of a 
national election, it can be moved up by a maximum of 6 months 
or delayed by up to 3 months. Therefore, the next DP convention 
is, basically, far more than a year away, but Chairman Yi 
recently referred to the possibility of moving it up within the 
range indicated in the party Constitution. He thus hinted at his 
so-called intent for en early convention, creating a subtle stir 
in the party; until then, he had been negative about moving up 
the convention date. Now, since he himself raised the issue, 
there must have been a reason for it. Conversely, his action 
proves that an anti-Yi offensive within the party is approaching 
to a critical level. In fact, the nonmainstreamers have been 
demanding, intermittently though, the holding of an 
extraordinary party convention sometime in the first half of 
1994. 
  Chairman Yi seems to be feeling the same pressure in the 
course of his management of the DP's National Assembly policy 
during the regular Assembly session, too. While the "nine man, 
nine different minds" criticism against the party leadership 
continues unabated, he could so far lead the party rather 
smoothly by effectively managing the balance of power among the 
members of the party Supreme Committee. However, as soon as he 
moved to show his own color in his National Assembly speech and 
in his parliamentary strategy as the opposition leader, the 
nonmainstreamers strongly reacted against it. Even among the 
Supreme Committee members, fewer came forward backing him up. No 
Mu-hyon and Yi Pu-yong of the Democratic faction [from the 
former DP before its merger with the UPP] turned their backs on 
him. No Mu-hyon, while holding on to his basic line since the 
last party convention in March, is nevertheless intensifying his 
criticism of Chairman continuously. What makes the chairman 
worry even more is that Yi Pu-yong, who had been relatively 
cooperative, reversed his attitude, turning critical of the 
chairman. Since No and Yi Pu-yong are also members of the Reform 
group, these things have spawned speculations that Chairman Yi 
has not only lost his grip of the Democratic faction but is 
perhaps shunned by the Reform group, too. Only two Supreme 
Committee members, Kwon No-kap and Han Kwang-ok, remain loyal to 
the chairman, while the Tonggyodong faction reportedly sees 
something missing in Chairman Yi, at times feeling dissatisfied. 
  Meanwhile, the Tonggyodong faction has been constantly on 
the 
move since it unified its genealogy in the name of [KTC's] Naeoe 
Munje Yonguso [Institute of Internal and External Affairs]. 
Recently, it reorganized Yonchong, a private organization of 
KTC. Chairman Yi also has launched a membership drive for his 
private organization, T'ongil Sanha Hoe [Society for Reunited 
Mountains and Rivers]. But he finds himself under mounting 
intraparty pressure. In short, the Reform group does not approve 
of "dual citizenship" of members, putting pressure on the 
chairman and his force. 
  Chairman Yi's camp is aware of all this subtle shifting. So 
much so that some insiders say that they might be oversensitive. 
At any rate, YKT and his force are known to be working on 
strategies to ensure that their leadership continues after the 
National Assembly regular session and further to defend its 
power base at the next party convention while keeping a close 
eye on its own faction that is turning rebellious, on the 
increasingly visible resistance of the progressive forces within 
the party, and on the growing signs of disharmony with the 
Tonggyodong faction, the main force in the DP. 
  In this atmosphere, Chairman Yi is said to have tried to 
contact KTC recently. In fact, this does not pay for either 
side. For KTC, it could harm the image of his retirement from 
politics. Chairman Yi could also be hurt because it would 
further enhance his image as a weak leader unable to run the 
party independently. But the immediate reality is that something 
has to be done to change the flow of things in the combined 
forces of a DP apparently plagued by internal disharmony. 
Chairman Yi's side in particular seems to be feeling the need 
more keenly. Therefore, reports say, he tried to contact the 
Tonggyodong camp while discreetly keeping a distance. 
  Acting as mediators between the two camps are Kwon No-kap 
and 
Han Kwang-ok, both members of the Supreme Committee, plus Rep. 
Mun Hui-sang, Chairman Yi's chief secretary, and Pak Chi-won, DP 
spokesman. Mun was the first chairman of Yonchong. He also had 
served as its sixth chairman until Kim Ok-tu took over recently. 
He is one of the key figures among KTC's direct disciples and he 
is always present at their gatherings. Despite his position as 
Yi's chief secretary, he would say unhesitatingly that "my `home 
base' is Tonggyodong." Pak also has his roots in Tonggyodong and 
was part of the KTC campaign in the last presidential election. 
The two are the key workers playing the role of a bridge between 
the YKT and KTC forces to prevent a split and ensure cooperation. 
  They are said to be playing the part of letting Chairman 
Yi's 
side know --through a variety of routes--what KTC thinks about 
Yi's National Assembly strategy and political course in general, 
or vice versa. They contend that there is no gap between 
Chairman Yi and KTC. They explain that there has been no change 
in their basic relationship--even amid the subtle undercurrent 
of a power game within the party. They assert that KTC has had 
no objections to Chairman Yi's political line, to the substance 
of his National Assembly speech delivered in October as a 
product of that new line, and to his press conference in late 
September in which Yi stated that he would give the economy 
priority over the issue of liquidating the past--namely, to all 
those things that fed the feud within the party. Needless to 
say, it was Mun Hui-sang himself who led the writing of that 
speech. Moreover, Pae Ki-son, former assistant chief secretary 
for KTC, also took an active part. Pae has also been working as 
an aide for Chairman Yi for some time. Another source familiar 
with developments on both sides asserts that "there is nothing 
going on that could fundamentally reverse the internal balance 
of power within the mainstream." He insists that the only 
problem is the dissatisfaction among mainstreamers with the 
performance of Chairman Yi, who they think lacks in leadership 
for an effective struggle against the ruling camp. And it is a 
problem that can be resolved, he adds. 
  The nonmainstreamers have a different view. While agreeing 
that the KTC-YKT alliance will not be easily shaken, they do not 
think that YKT will remain the alternative for the mainstreamers 
for too long. At the same time, the mainstreamers themselves 
have the realistic need to try and shake the mainstreamers from 
inside to make sure that he will not. Their concerns are, in 
fact, no longer over the KTC-YKT alliance but are focused on the 
moves of the Tonggyodong faction.

  [Text] Jakarta, Feb. 9 (ANTARA) -- Commander of the 
Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI) Gen. Feisal Tanjung said here 
Wednesday that it would be okay for Indonesian volunteers to go 
to Bosnia-Herzegovina and assist the struggle of its people. 
"Yes, I would say that it's okay," he said when asked by newsmen 
on whether or not Indonesian volunteers could go to the war-torn 
country. 
  Two Islamic organizations, the Indonesian Islamic Boarding 
House Cooperation Agency (BKSPPI) and the Indonesian Committee 
for the World Islamic Solidarity (KISDI) have stated that they 
will draw up the list of volunteers to go to Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
Indonesian people has also extended assistance to the Bosnians 
in the form of financial aid raised by the National Committee 
for the solidarity of the Bosnian Muslims headed by business 
tycoon Probosutejo. The financial aid reportedly totalled 
hundreds of million rupiah. 
  The government has also sent 24 military officers as 
observers under the UN banner. In the near future, a military 
health team will also be sent to the former Yugoslav state.

  [Text] Jakarta, Feb 9 (OANA-ANTARA) -- The visit by Taiwan 
President Li Teng-hui to Indonesia will in no way change 
Indonesia's line of one china policy, said Foreign Ministers Ali 
Alatas. "President Li Teng-hui's visit will not change a bit of 
our policy of one China. We retain the line," he said here on 
Tuesday. 
  He was commenting on the protests forwarded by Beijing and 
circles concerned here on a planned meeting between Taiwan 
President Li Teng-hui and President Suharto in Bali later this 
week. The circles expressed their concern that such a meeting 
could destabilize the relations between Indonesia and China. 
  "Li Teng-hui's visit to Bali is only an informal one. He is 
on vacation in Bali. There is nothing deviated from Indonesia's 
stance on having only trade relations with Taiwan," he said. 
  He noted that there is no need for the public to worry that 
Indonesia will change its one China policy. "Foreign Ministry 
has given necessary explanation to Chinese ambassador here and 
our staffs in Beijing did so to the Chinese Government. There is 
no need to exagerate such a meeting as both leaders will meet in 
their own personal capacity. Li's meeting with Minister of 
Research and Technology B.J. Habibie is also a kind of two 
scientists' meeting," he said. 
  Asked about the possibility of Taiwan's presence in APEC 
leaders' informal meeting here next November, Alatas said that 
the procedure of organizing the summit meeting of APEC leaders 
will be the same as that of in Seattle, the United States, last 
November. "Jakarta's meeting next November will be the same as 
that of one in Seattle. It'll be still a informal one. Hong 
Kong and Taiwan will be represented by their ministers, he said.

  [Text] Denpasar, Bali, Feb. 9 (ANEX-ANTARA) -- Chief of the 
Indonesian Army Gen. Wismoyo Arismunandar said here Tuesday that 
Bali and East Timor because of their "uniqueness" need a special 
attention regarding the aspect of security. 
  "Bali, as a major tourist attraction is an international 
gate 
to Indonesia, while East Timor as the country's youngest 
province still has a lot to catch up with the progress of other 
provinces," he said in an address to mark the transfer of post 
of the chief of Udayana Military Command. 
  The post of the commander of the Udayana Military Command 
(supervising Bali, East Timor, and Lesser Sunda Islands) was 
handed over from Maj. Gen Theo Syafei to Maj. Gen R. Adang 
Rukhiatna Puradireja. 
  Wismoyo further said that the Udayana Military Command has a 
heavy task because aside from supervsing Bali and East Timor and 
all their uniqueness, it must also look after Lesser Sunda 
Islands which are prone to natural disasters. 
  "This obviously calls for a high spirit of dedication among 
the Udayana Military Command members," he said adding that the 
command's main task is maintaining security and stability so 
that development activities can take place smoothly. 
  About development programs, Wismoyo, however, also said that 
they must be conducted in such a way that not only economic 
growth is achieved, but also even distribution of welfare.

<F P=106> [By Frank Longid Jr.] </F>
  [Text] The National Democratic Front [NDF] wants to resume 
exploratory talks with government provided a preliminary meeting 
is held on issues the NDF wants to resolve before accepting the 
invitation to meet with government representatives in Vietnam. 
  The NDF also insisted on the presence of exiled Communist 
Party of the Philippines [CPP] founder Jose Ma. Sison during 
talks with government. Although Fr. Luis Jalandoni is the NDF's 
official representative, Sison -- who is believed to be the 
current CPP chairman under the nom de guerre Armando Liwanag -- 
is recognized as a "consultant" of Jalandoni on the peace 
process. 
  In a 22 January letter addressed to Ambassador Howard Dee, 
chairman of the government panel dealing with the communist 
rebels, Jalandoni stressed the need to "adequately resolve 
certain matters of principle and procedure. The NDF is willing 
to resume exploratory talks," Jalandoni wrote. However, he said 
government must first "adhere to the Hague Declaration" and 
remove the obstacles to the peace process. 
  Members of the panel and its working groups confirmed the 
contents of the document but refused to discuss it further, as 
well as the courses of action the panel is considering. Dee in 
27 December accepted the NDF's invitation for a preliminary 
meeting in Europe before holding further exploratory talks in 
Vietnam. But he said the NDF must drop "their preconditions to 
the exploratory talks." 
  In response, Jalandoni wrote "contrary to your allegations 
that the NDF is making a precondition of EO [Executive Order] 
125, it is Mr. Ramos who has thrown a monkey wrench into the 
peace process by issuing EO 125." He added "any delay in the 
NDF-GRP [Government of the Republic of the Philippines] talks is 
ascribable to the Ramos regime's refusal to adhere to the letter 
and spirit of the Hague Declaration, and setting up obstacles to 
the peace process." 
  Jalandoni said the executive order is "a violation of the 
Hague Declaration because it delimits the NDF-GRP talks to what 
already appears in the existing GRP constitution." But Dee had 
said that EO 125 cannot be rescinded because the order "in 
effect creates the office of the peace process and also the 
three panels (dealing with the country's rebel groups)." 
  In addition, a source in the panel explained that the EO 
"does not necessarily delimit the talks...it is an internal 
document and the NDF is not covered by it." 
  Jalandoni also denounced what he called "the Ramos regime's 
continuing total war policy." But the source said the protest 
was "uncalled for," claiming the firefights between government 
troops and communist guerrillas have been declining steadily. 
"Isa pa," [One more thing] he added, "aren't they the ones who 
had earlier stated that we should conduct talks first before 
declaring a cease-fire, that any cessation of hostilities should 
come after the talks and not before?" 
  Jalandoni also claimed government "has been coddling (NDF) 
renegades and expellees from the revolutionary movement." He 
said this, along with "statements threatening to withdraw from 
talks with the NDF and to hold peace talks with the renegades 
and expellees," were all part of government's "psy-war" efforts.

  [Text] Cotabato City -- Fighting between the military and 
guerrillas of the major Muslim rebel groups is still raging in 
the mountainous town of Barira, Maguindanao. An officer of the 
6th Infantry Division based in the town of Dinaig said the 
hostilities began 27 January when a combined force of about 600 
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and Moro National 
Liberation Front (MNLF) fighters attacked three security 
checkpoints of the Consunji logging company. The logging company 
has been operating in the area for many years. 
  Two security guards died during the attack on the 
checkpoints 
located a few kilometers from MILF's Camp Abubakar Sedik. Al Haj 
Murad, MILF vice chairman for operations and concurrent 
chief-of-staff of the Bangsamoro Islamic Army, denied the 
military's allegations. Murad said the fighting started when 
combined forces of the logging company's security guards and the 
military encroached on and penetrated the defense perimeter area 
of their camp. 
  Murad said there has been a standing formal agreement 
between 
the MILF and the government for a cease-fire. The agreement, 
respected until the incident of 27 January, was entered into in 
1984. 
  The clashes also constitute a gross violation of the ongoing 
government-MNLF cease-fire agreement, Murad said. The MILF, he 
added, had always supported the peace negotiations between the 
government and the MNLF and the cease-fire agreement forged 
earlier this month. The MILF, he said, has not been formally 
included in the ongoing peace talks but had pledged support to 
it. He hoped the clashes will not escalate into major 
hostilities. 
  He called on all concerned to find ways to stop this even as 
he ordered MILF fighters and supporters in Mindanao to be on a 
more "active" defense posture.

<F P=106> [By Grace Q. Bangaoil] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Philippine economy grew by 2.3 percent in 
1993 but fell short of the 2.5 percent downscaled target by the 
National Economic Development Authority (NEDA). In a press 
conference yesterday, NEDA officials led by Economic Planning 
Secretary Cielito F. Habito said the gross national product 
(GNP) growth rate last year made them stick to the 4.5 percent 
in 1994. 
  They pointed out that the GNP growth in 1993 reflected a 
"definite" improvement from the 1 percent real growth in 1992. 
"The 4.5 percent for 1994 under the Medium-Term Philippine 
Development Plan is achievable," Habito assured in a separate 
interview. The growth, according to the NEDA officials, was 
primarily led by the private sector. Consumer purchases, 
investment and exports all posted improvement. 
  The domestic economy likewise improved in 1993. Gross 
domestic product (GDP) grew by 1.7 percent from 0.1 percent in 
1992. NEDA said this shows that the local economy has gathered 
steam. [passage omitted] 
  NEDA cited the improvement in power supply as a "big factor" 
in the economic growth last year. Although the year started 
with a "debilitating" power crisis which kept the economy from 
growing in the first six months, the fast-tracked power projects 
came on stream to improve the power situation in the last two 
quarters, the officials said. 
  Net inflow from abroad amounted to P [Philippine pesos] 21.8 
billion, showing a 27.5 percent improvement compared to that in 
1992. In real peso terms, however, imports grew by 13.7 percent 
outstripping total exports which increased by 9 percent 
according to NEDA director Ofelia Templo. 
  Templo said the disparity may be corrected this year when 
export growth in real peso term is expected to reach 11.2 
percent and import growth to slow down to 12 percent. 
  All production sectors showed better performance in 1993. 
The agriculture sector initially provided the push in the first 
two quarters. When power supply improved in the third and 
fourth quarter, the industry sector played a more dominant role. 
  Among the production sectors, the services sector recorded 
the highest growth of 2 percent compared to 1 percent in 1992. 
The services subsectors -- except for the government services 
-- improved, communications went up by 6.5 percent, private 
services by 2.9 percent and trade by 2.4 percent. 
  The output of the combined agriculture, fishery and forestry 
sector went up by 1.5 percent, showing a turn around from the 
0.1 percent decrease in 1992. Growth came from palay [unhusked 
rice] which went up by 7.9 percent, livestock at 4.7 percent, 
poultry by 6 percent, and corn which grew by 1.8 percent. 
  Among the industry subsectors, construction growth showed 
the 
highest at 4.5 percent. According to the NEDA officials, this 
was mainly due to higher public construction growth as well as 
the turn around in private sector construction activities. 
[passage omitted] 
  Growth on the demand side was marked by a strong export 
performance. In real terms, merchandise exports expanded by 13 
percent led by semi-conductors and electronic microcircuits. 
[passage omitted] 
  Investments in fixed capital grew by 8.6 percent which is 
slightly lower than the 9.2 percent in 1992, though marked this 
time by a huge increase in private construction which grew by 
7.1 percent. 
  To stimulate the growth of the production sector, NEDA 
proposed some measures which include: 
  -- Ensure the normalization of power supply; 
  -- Vigorously implement the key commercial crop 
development program to increase the production of high-value 
crops; and 
  -- Undertake intensive promotional campaign to attract 
more tourist investors into the country.

  [Excerpts] The visit of the Malaysian Prime Minister 
Mahathir Bin Mohamed ends more than three decades of chilly 
relationship between Malaysia and the Philippines. It marks the 
beginning of the normalization of the relationship that had been 
hampered by their territorial dispute over Sabah, now in fact 
one of the federal states of Malaysia. 
  The visit is a breakthrough in the sense that the dropping 
of 
the Philippine claim to Sabah was not a precondition to Doctor 
Mahathir's visit. High on the agenda are issues associated with 
the expansion of bilateral economic relationship within the 
context of transforming Asean into an economic bloc that can 
counter the protectionist tendencies of competing regional 
groups such as the North American Free Trade Association and the 
European Community. 
  In shelving the Sabah issue, both the Philippines and 
Malaysia recognize that the territorial dispute does not stand 
in the way of expanding economic relationship, which is now a 
priority over political questions. [passage omitted] 
  In this decade where economic development commands the 
priority of the Asia-Pacific nations, the expansion of bilateral 
relationship between Manila and Kuala Lumpur has become more 
important than fanning the embers of a territorial dispute.

  [Text] A 24-hour general strike in Vanuatu is reported to 
have severely disrupted government, airline, and other services 
in the country. There have also been reports of several people 
being taken to hospital as a result of violence relating to the 
strike. The strike has been organized by the Vanuatu Council of 
Trade Unions in support of public servants who have been on 
strike for 10 weeks in a pay dispute with the government. 
  The news agency, PACNEWS, says all government offices in the 
central capital, Port Vila, (Lugen Ville), and other government 
centers have closed. Hospital outpatient departments were 
closed except for emergencies and nearly all schools and fuel 
stations in Port Vila and other centers were closed. 
International flights in and out of Port Vila were disrupted 
with one flight being canceled. The domestic airline, Van Air, 
was also affected. 
  The vice president of the Trade Unions Council, Barton 
Basiwe, said some government sympathizers had harassed strikers, 
including incidents involving sticks and stands on trucks.

  [Text] In Vanuatu, a 24-hour general strike has been 
extended indefinitely. Yesterday, Vanuatu Council of Trade 
Unions held a 24-hour stoppage in support of a 10-week old 
strike by public servants over a pay claim. 
  The council's secretary, Ephraim Kalsakav, says the general 
strike was successful with most schools closing and government 
services disrupted. The airport was closed for several hours, 
delaying domestic and international travel. Scruffles broke out 
on picket lines with several people taken to hospital for minor 
injuries. 
  Mr. Kalsakav said the strike would continue indefinetly 
until 
the government reopens negotiations with public servants.

Province, disclosed that the Interior Ministry on 4 February 
issued an order instructing provincial administrations along the 
border with Cambodia to open for 24 hours per day temporary 
crossing points for Thai logging companies to transport timber 
left stranded in Cambodia. The opening of the crossing points 
will last until 31 March. The Cambodian Government earlier 
announced a relaxation of the timber export ban for Thai loggers 
to transport their timber to Thailand before the 31 March 
deadline. [passage omitted] 
  Some 100,000 to 200,000 cubic meters of timber worth several 
hundred million baht of Thai logging companies will be sent 
across the border to Thailand. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Nong Khai province is preferred by Thailand as 
the site of Vientiane's first consulate to help visits by 
Laotians after the Thai-Lao Friendship bridge is inaugurated, 
Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said yesterday. Prasong was 
speaking after discussions with his Laotian counterpart Somsavat 
Lengsavat, who is making an official visit at the invitation of 
the Foreign Ministry. [passage omitted] 
  Prasong said he told Somsavat that Thailand preferred the 
first Laotian consulate to be in Nong Khai. 
  An informed source said Prasong's proposal was appropriate 
as 
the bridge would become the pre-eminent entry point for both 
countries. 
  The source said Vientiane had initially considered either 
Nong Khai or Khon Kaen for the consulate. 
  Somsavat will pass on the Thai proposal to his government 
for 
approval. He told guests at yesterday's ceremony that his visit 
will help to strengthen bilateral relations and that Laotians 
are excited about the opening of the bridge and HM the King 
visiting the country. Somsavat, accompanied by Prasong, 
yesterday evening was granted an audience with the King at 
Chitlada Palace. According to the source, Somsavat was to have 
informed the King of his schedule for inaugurating the bridge.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 9 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Wednesday [9 February] that Japan-U.S. "Framework" 
trade talks are deadlocked, showing pessimism on whether a 
settlement can be reached before his meeting with U.S. President 
Bill Clinton in Washington on Friday. "Everything has come to 
an impasse," Hosokawa told reporters when asked about progress 
in talks focusing on automobile and auto parts, insurance, and 
government procurement of telecommunications and medical 
equipment. 
  Asked whether he will send International Trade and Industry 
Minister Hiroshi Kumagai to Washington in a last-minute effort 
to break the impasse, Hosokawa said the situation is still 
"fluid." He said various moves were possible to break the 
impasse, suggesting that Kumagai will go to the United States. 
  Senior Japanese and U.S. officials met Tuesday in Washington 
for yet another round of talks on ways to ensure U.S. access to 
the Japanese market, but no agreement was reached. 
  The biggest stumbling block, Japanese and U.S. officials 
said, centers on the issue of "objective criteria" for measuring 
if the Japanese market is truly open to imports. The U.S. 
Government has demanded that Japan accept a variety of numerical 
targets such as import levels to evaluate the openness of its 
market to foreign goods. 
  Hosokawa told reporters Japan's acceptance of such 
"objective 
criteria" is "impossible," adding that the U.S. is also showing 
no sign of softening its stance. The premier made the remarks 
after a meeting with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, Finance 
Minister Hirohisa Fujii and the trade minister at his official 
residence.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 9 KYODO -- Japan should scrap its 
remaining tariffs on materials used in car parts and cut levies 
on imported sugar, a government panel said Wednesday [9 
February]. The report by the Customs Tariff Council, an 
advisory panel to the finance minister, came just two days 
before a deadline on Japan-U.S. trade talks, which both sides 
say have become particularly bogged down over the contentious 
auto and auto parts issue. 
  The council urged repealing a 4.6 percent tariff on rubber 
tubing for radiator hoses, a 2.4 percent levy on rubber belts 
and a 9.6 percent tariff on polyester material used for seat 
covers. 
  The report, which excludes levies covered by December's 
global accord under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT), says scrapping the import duties would almost eliminate 
Japanese tariffs on auto parts. 
  A ministry official said the foreign share in the three 
areas 
should increase, adding that foreign radiator tubes account for 
only 200 million yen of the 85 billion yen annual Japanese 
market, and that foreign rubber belts and the seat cover 
material each amount to 600 million yen of 11 billion yen 
markets. 
  The report said tariffs on raw sugar should be slashed by 
21.5 yen per kilogram to 20.0 yen, which the official said would 
amount to about 60 percent. It called for lowering those on 
refined sugar by the same amount to 35.5 yen per kilogram, which 
he said would be about 80 percent.

  [Text] The U.S. Federal Reserve Board [FRB] decided late 
last week to tighten the money market for the first time in five 
years. 
  Commenting on the FRB's decision, Bank of Japan Governor 
Yasushi Mieno, said: I believe FRB Chairman Greenspan, who has 
asserted that interest rates have remained too low during the 
months of economic recovery, has concluded that it has become 
necessary to raise interest rates to keep the U.S. economy 
growing longer. I believe that the tight monetary control in 
the United States will have no major impact on international 
financial markets. 
  In this way, Mr. Mieno indicated that tight monetary control 
in the United States will not bring about any drastic change to 
foreign exchange and stock markets.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 5 KYODO -- The U.S. Federal Reserve 
Board's reversing of its easy-money policy will have little 
affect on Japan's interest rate movement, a Bank of Japan source 
said Saturday [5 February]. 
  "I don't believe the Fed has decided to tighten the credit 
condition. Rather, it has driven it to natural [as received]," 
the source said on condition of anonymity. 
  Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said Friday the Federal Open 
Market Committee has decided to tighten its credit policy which 
is "expected to be associated with a small increase in 
short-term money market rates." 
  The source said the Fed has so far guided interest rates 
lower as an emergency step to realize the economic recovery and 
the stable financial mechanism. 
  "Now that the U.S. economy is on the recovery, the Fed may 
have given up the idea of lowering rates. If it continues to 
ease credit conditions, fears of inflation may arise," the 
source said. 
  "Interest rate development in the Japanese short-term money 
market is set by domestic factors, rather than the U.S.'s. It 
is hard to believe it will have a big influence on Japan's 
credit policy."

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- Japanese and U.S. military 
leaders hailed the successful conclusion Friday [4 February] of 
the 1994 Keen Edge computer-simulated military exercises, the 
U.S. Forces Japan (USFJ) reported. The 10-day exercises, 
directed jointly by Japanese and U.S. military officials, 
involved some 3,400 Japanese and 3,200 U.S. participants, the 
USFJ reported in a news release. 
  Gen. Tetsuya Nishimoto, chairman of the Joint Staff Council 
of the Self-Defense Forces, said the exercises gave the 
commanders a "comprehensive assessment of the ground, navy, air, 
joint and combined operations." In addition to operational 
capability, the exercise also "enables us to develop the very 
comprehensive and capable logistics and support functions we 
will need to win the war," Nishimoto said. 
  USFJ Commander Lt. Gen. Richard Myers said the simulator 
"proved its ability to realistically test procedures and 
logistics support for simulated air, land, and sea operations, 
and in doing so, increased the training value of the exercise 
for both the U.S. and Japanese participants." 
  "This exercise was a great test of the U.S. and Japanese 
military staffs' ability to conduct crisis action planning and 
to practice commanding and controlling the simulated movement of 
equipment and forces," said Myers. "I am absolutely confident 
both staffs are now able to do a better job of defending Japan 
should the need ever arise," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 7 KYODO -- Nissho Iwai Corp., Japan's 
leading trading house, has agreed with the Vietnamese Government 
to jointly establish a chemical fertilizer venture in Ho Chi 
Minh City, company officials said Monday [7 February]. Under 
the preliminary agreement, Nissho Iwai and Southern Fertilizer 
Co. (SFC), which is controlled by the local government, will set 
up the venture as early as March, the officials said. 
  Nissho Iwai plans to import 200,000 tons of chemical 
fertilizer annually from the venture, they said. The new 
company is capitalized at 10 million dollars, and Nissho Iwai 
will hold a 51 percent equity share with SFC holding the rest. 
The new firm will establish a factory to manufacture chemical 
fertilizer with an annual capacity of 200,000 to 300,000 tons, 
the officials said. Nissho Iwai and SFC want to start the 
operation in September 1996. The venture is Nissho Iwai's first 
business deal in Vietnam, they said.

  Moreover, he said that the term territory has become a 
painful word to the Russians who lost territories as a result of 
the collapse of the Soviet Union and that if Japan presses 
Russia to solve the territorial issue by using such a word, 
nothing will be solved.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- Shinseito co-leader Ichiro 
Ozawa said Tuesday [8 February] he thinks by intuition that 
North Korea has already developed nuclear weapons. Ozawa told a 
press conference that "it is impossible to explain" the basis 
for his belief that the country is developing nuclear weapons 
because "I have not seen it with my own eyes, but I believe so, 
that's my hunch." 
  Ozawa, one of the main strategists of the coalition 
government, told a television interview Sunday that North Korea 
"definitely has nuclear arms," without giving any evidence to 
back up his statement. He reasoned that if the country did not 
have any nuclear weapons, it would open its facilities to 
inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
Ozawa said that if it has nothing to hide, it "should show 
everything." 
  The pro-Pyongyang General Association of Korean Residents in 
Japan (Chongryun) demanded that Ozawa withdraw his remarks, 
saying "they are preposterous and defiant" and that they "ignore 
elementary diplomatic common sense."

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- Japan on Tuesday [8 
February] condemned the devastating mortar attack on a Sarajevo 
marketplace last Saturday, but remained noncommittal on support 
for possible air strikes against Bosnian Serbs to end the siege 
of the capital. "We strongly condemn such a barbarous and 
atrocious act against innocent civilians," Foreign Ministry 
Deputy Spokesman Kishichiro Amae said. 
  Referring to the attack on an open-air Muslim marketplace 
that killed 68 civilians and injured some 200, Amae said Japan 
"considers that the offenders should be identified as soon as 
possible and duly punished." But the spokesman did not go so 
far as to express support for air strikes by the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization (NATO) on Bosnian Serb artillery and mortar 
sites in the hills around Sarajevo. 
  UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali asked the NATO 
allies Sunday to authorize the use of air power in response to 
the shelling of Sarajevo. NATO is expected to decide whether to 
take such action in a meeting on Wednesday in Brussels, which 
will be attended by the ambassadors to NATO from its 16 member 
countries.

<F P=106> [By Keiko Tatsuta: "Japanese Firms Cautiously Seeking </F>
Business With Israel"] 
  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 9 KYODO -- Japanese companies are 
seemingly cautious but steady in seeking business with Israel 
following its historic accord with the Palestine Liberation 
Organization (PLO) last September. 
  One group of Japanese firms and individuals is preparing to 
set up the Japan-Israel Business Club on February 16 to exchange 
information about the climate for investment and trade in the 
Jewish nation, industry sources said. However, a major trading 
firm, which is said to have initiated the club's formation, was 
nervous about being identified and refused to comment. 
  Other trading houses seem to be unaware about the 
organization or undecided about joining. 
  The club will serve as a "saloon" for individual members, 
who 
effectively represent their respective firms, the sources said. 
  Many Japanese companies have avoided taking conspicuous 
action to boost trade with Israel, apparently still fearful of 
the Arab League's boycott, which means the loss of Arab markets 
and oil supplies. 
  "The peace agreement would not have substantial impact on 
our 
business because there remains the Arab boycott, though it is 
somewhat becoming a mere shell," said a spokesman for Itochu 
Corp. Itochu has never been involved with setting up the club, 
another spokesman said. 
  Arab states have boycotted the Jewish society in three 
stages 
-- primarily by cutting economic relations with Israel, 
rejecting business with companies that have economic relations 
with Israel, and boycotting firms connected with those that do 
business with the nation. 
  Although Kuwait announced last June that it was ready to 
stop 
blacklisting companies doing business with Israel, the effective 
date is uncertain since the Arab League's previously planned 
plenary session on the issue was indefinitely postponed, said an 
official of the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO). 
  "We are in a stage of watching developments there," Hiroshi 
Nozu, Middle East and Africa section general manager of the 
international corporate planning department of Marubeni Corp., 
said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE. 
  Nezu said Marubeni will seek business with Israel at a "slow 
and steady" pace because political uncertainty in the region 
remains despite the accord, which he called an "agreement for 
agreement." 
  Because Israel has advanced technology in such areas as 
agriculture, biology, telecommunications and aviation, Marubeni 
believes future ties are promising, Nozu said. 
  Nozu denied having heard of the Japan-Israel Business Club. 
  The Itochu spokesman said that in terms of population, only 
Egypt and Turkey are the region's large markets. Itochu 
business with the two, mainly in crude oil, vehicles and plant 
equipment, will continue as before, he said. 
  Currently, Itochu does not plan to open a representative 
office in Israel, and no immediate impact on Itochu is expected 
as a result of the Israel-PLO agreement, the spokesman said. 
  "We cannot help being cautious about business with Israel 
because of psychological factors," said Masami Naruse, assistant 
manager of corporate communications division of Mitsui and Co. 
  "It all depends on what will become of the Arab boycott," 
Naruse said, "because we have close relations with Arab nations 
such as the UAE (United Arab Emirates) and Kuwait." He said his 
company has yet to decide whether to participate in the 
Japan-Israel Business Club. 
  According to government statistics, Japan's trade with 
Middle 
East nations has gradually expanded, from 29.04 billion dollars 
in 1988 to 44.46 billion dollars in 1992. The figures include 
trade with North African states and exclude Turkey. 
  For the January-November period in 1993, however, trade with 
these countries decreased by 7.8 percent from the same period in 
1992. 
  Meanwhile, bilateral trade between Japan and Israel 
increased 
by 3.2 percent for the first 11 months last year over the same 
period in 1992. It expanded from 1.1 billion dollars in 1988 to 
1.7 billion dollars in 1992. 
  Japan's exports to Israel, mainly automobiles, amounted to 
about 1 billion dollars in 1992, while imports from Israel, 
primarily diamonds, came to around 700 million dollars. 
  Japan's vehicle exports to Israel totaled 66,792 units last 
year, following 82,249 in 1992 and 58,593 in 1991, according to 
the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association. 
  Among nine exporting automakers, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. 
ranked first with about 24,000 units for the January-November 
period of 1993, industry sources said. 
  While Mitsubishi and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. have a long 
history in exporting autos to Israel, others were relative 
newcomers, the sources said. 
  "The general business environment there is headed in a 
favorable direction," a Nissan Motor Co. spokeswoman said. 
However, because Israel's population of five million is not 
big, Nissan does not expect the peace accord to lead to a rapid 
increase in export volume, she said. "We'll just steadily 
market our products there" at the current pace of some 3,000 
vehicles per year, she said. 
  Despite uncertainty over the boycott, Japan and Israel will 
deepen bilateral ties from a long-term viewpoint, said Yoshihiro 
Otsuji, director of the Middle East-Africa office of the 
International Trade Policy Bureau at the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry (MITI). 
  Inquiries concerning the boycott and other information on 
Israel have been increasing since last November and exchanges 
between MITI officials and Israeli counterparts have expanded, 
Otsuji said. 
  The Japanese Government has officially called for an end to 
the trade refusal.

Organization (JETRO) will start next Tuesday [8 February] 
providing free counters to importers in seven cities to help 
sell foreign products, JETRO officials said Saturday. The 
counters, called "JETRO Import Squares," are aimed at boosting 
the availability of imports outside Tokyo, where the majority of 
importers run shops. 
  Importers can use the JETRO squares for a year free of 
charge, excluding utility costs. The squares will be provided 
in seven major local cities -- Sapporo, Nagoya, Sendai, 
Takamatsu, Fukuoka, Osaka and Hiroshima.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 9 KYODO -- Japan's Finance Ministry 
announced Wednesday [9 February] the easing of regulations, 
effective in March and April, in a bid to spur international 
financial dealings. The ministry is to allow more freedom under 
the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law on deposits, 
securities transactions, direct investment, lending and 
borrowing, and import-export accounts. 
  For overseas nonyen deposits by residents, the amount which 
is free of ministry permission will be raised to up to 100 
million yen from the current 30 million yen March 1. 
  Referring to last year's statistics, a ministry official 
said 
overseas foreign currency deposits with between 30 to 100 
million yen accounted for about half of the 130 deposits 
approved overall. 
  The same measure will be taken for investment by residents 
on 
overseas securities and by nonresidents on domestic securities. 
  The nonpermission amount for nonbank lending and borrowing 
between residents and nonresidents will be raised to up to 100 
million yen from the current 10 million yen. 
  On the current 10 million yen limit per case for trading 
houses and other firms using an accounting method of offsetting 
export and import payments between head offices and overseas 
branches, the ministry will allow an increase of up to 100 
million yen from April 1. 
  The period for leaving the payments on the accounting record 
for settlements through the offsetting method will be extended 
to six months from the current three months. 
  The ministry will also abolish and ease March 1 various 
reporting obligations linked to the above regulation revisions. 
The move is intended to "improve convenience and further 
facilitate overseas dealings amid international financial 
transactions becoming increasingly active," ministry officials 
said. 
  They said the measures are in line with an agreement late 
last year under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT)-sponsored Uruguay Round of multilateral talks and also 
with an administrative reform outline decided by the government 
Tuesday.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- Science and Technology 
Agency Director General Satsuki Eda Friday [4 February] 
dismissed concerns that Japan's rocket development program aims 
at turning the country into a major military power. 
  To the contrary, Eda said, the successful launching earlier 
in the day of an H-2 series rocket, the first to use wholly 
Japanese components "turned space from a theater for Soviet-U.S. 
military competition into a sphere of activity for people who 
want to give wings to peaceful dreams." 
  Eda told a news conference following a regular cabinet 
meeting that Japan's plutonium program and its rocket 
development, which have sparked international concerns over the 
country's nuclear intentions, are both strictly devoted to 
peaceful purposes. He said Japan would "pay careful attention" 
so that no such concern need arise.

  [Text] Aomori, Feb. 8 KYODO -- A malfunction in a 
compressor at a uranium enrichment plant in Rokkasho, Aomori 
Prefecture, on Monday [7 February] has forced the closure of the 
plant for two to three months, Japan Nuclear Fuel Ltd. said 
Tuesday. A statement from the Aomori-based company said the 
compressor is responsible for conveying depleted uranium to a 
waste recovery vessel. It said there were no radioactive leaks 
as a result of the breakdown. 
  The company said that at 10:40 A.M., part of the device 
which 
monitors the factory's operations malfunctioned and that when 
the factory was reactivated after an inspection, the compressor 
stopped operating. The same machine has broken down three times 
previously.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 7 KYODO -- A Finance Ministry advisory 
panel on Monday [7 February] completed a report on rules for 
stock trading in anticipation of deregulation on the practice of 
companies buying their own shares, panel officials said. 
  The rules, worked out by a special group of the Securities 
and Exchange Council, require corporations to regularly disclose 
quarterly trading of their own shares, the officials said. They 
said firms acquiring their own shares will be barred from making 
buy orders at prices higher than the previous day's closing 
price. 
  The regulations are designed to prevent insider trading and 
stock price manipulation which are banned under the Securities 
and Exchange Law. 
  A company will be barred from buying its own shares for a 
certain period of time preceding the closing of daily trading in 
order to avoid stock manipulation, the officials said. 
  The officials said the report will be submitted to Finance 
Minister Hirohisa Fujii after it is approved at the council's 
plenary session February 21.

position on the issue into consideration. 
  The ministry had urged that a tax cut proposal be combined

  Fujii told reporters that Tuesday's agreement was not based 
solely on the ministry proposal, but did take it into account. 
He also said the whole amount of the tax cut will be funded by 
deficit-covering bond issues.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- Japanese business leaders 
Tuesday [8 February] welcomed the government's new pump-priming 
package, expressing hope that it will help boost the stalled 
Japanese economy. Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan 
Federation of Employers Associations (Nikkeiren), said the 
package should give a further impetus to the Japanese economy, 
which he said is beginning to show signs of recovery. 
  Some executives, however, expressed doubts over the 
confusion 
in the coalition government following Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's announcement of a "national welfare tax." 
  He proposed last Thursday that the government introduce a 
fresh 7 percent "national welfare tax" in April 1997 to finance 
the tax reduction that will be retroactive to January 1. But in 
the face of stiff opposition from the Social Democratic Party 
[of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], the biggest contingent in his 
seven-party coalition, he was forced to retract the scheme. 
  Yoshiaki Sakakura, chairman of the Japan Department Stores 
Association, said he was perplexed when Hosokawa retracted the 
tax cut proposal. 
  Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of 
Corporate 
Executives (Keizai Doyukai), said the SDPJ should have acted "in 
a more responsible manner" as the No. 1 coalition partner. 
  Nagano also said the size of the tax cuts could have been 
larger but added he had no objections to implementing tax cuts 
without securing funds to finance them. 
  Osamu Uno, chairman of the Kansai Economic Federation 
(Kankeiren) in western Japan, also said implementing tax cuts 
without securing funds to make up for them was unavoidable 
because Japan is in deep recession and Hosokawa faces a summit 
with U.S. President Bill Clinton on Friday in Washington.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- The government and the 
ruling coalition parties agreed Tuesday [8 February] to slash 
the inheritance tax, retroactive to January 1, to ease the 
burden caused by a steep rise in land prices, government sources 
said. 
  The sources said the revenue decrease will amount to about 
170 billion yen in the initial year. They said the tax cut will 
be made by raising the minimum taxable level to 50 million yen 
from the present 48 million yen and boosting tax exemption for 
individual heirs to 10 million yen from 9.5 million yen. 
  Tax rates on inherited assets ranging from 10 to 70 percent 
will remain unchanged but the number of tax gradations will be 
rearranged to nine from the present 13, they said. The highest 
tax rate of 70 percent will be applied to inherited assets 
exceeding 2 billion yen in value, up from the present 1 billion 
yen, the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- The head of the

view that financial sources to cover a tax reduction announced 
earlier in the day are ensured from a broader viewpoint. 
  Kan Kato was commenting on a decision by the government of 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to slash income and other taxes 
worth 5.85 trillion yen as part of an economic stimulative 
package and to discuss how to fund the cuts in a consultative 
body to be created within the coalition government. 
  "We now have a system whereby we can solve the issue of 
revenues," he told reporters. "In a wide sense, we have managed 
to come through with putting the tax reduction together with a 
tax increase." 
  Kato said he will keep a keen eye on discussions to be made 
in the consulting body. 
  "We have put off deciding on the revenues, but we must come 
to a conclusion by the end of the year. The Tax Commission will 
keep participating in the struggle," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- A standard family of a 
couple and two children with an annual income of 8 million yen 
will receive 160,000 yen in tax rebates as a result of the 
income and residential tax cuts announced Tuesday [8 February], 
government officials said. 
  The one-year tax cuts worth 5.85 trillion yen were adopted 
as 
part of a pump-priming package aimed at getting the faltering 
economy back on its feet. 
  The officials said the income tax refunds for the January to 
June period will be made in June and those for the second half 
at the end of the year. 
  As for the residential tax rebate, the refunds will be made 
in part by reducing such tax payments to zero in June and July 
and in part by prorating the remainder for the 10-month period 
from August, in equal installments. Currently, the standard 
household pays 460,000 yen in income tax and 330,000 yen in 
residential tax annually. 
  With the stimulative package calling for slashing individual 
and local residential taxes by 20 percent each, households with 
annual incomes of 8 million yen will receive about 160,000 yen, 
the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 9 KYODO -- The ruling coalition 
Wednesday [9 February] adopted a tax reform platform for fiscal 
1994 following the previous day's agreement among coalition 
leaders on the tax issue. The seven-party coalition, in line 
with Tuesday's accord, called for a one-year, 5.47 trillion yen 
income and resident tax cut and taxation modifications to 
rectify inequities. 
  Measures proposed to redress the tax burden inequalities 
include a levy of 10 percent on entertainment expenses declared 
by companies even within the currently nontaxable limit and a 
punitively heavy tax on companies' unexplained expenses. 
  Inheritance taxation would be relaxed by enlarging tax 
brackets and lowering tax rates. 
  Liquor taxes would be raised, such as a 9 yen tax increase 
on 
a 633-milliliter bottle of beer. 
  Also included in the proposal are tax incentives for 
stimulating land and housing transactions.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 9 KYODO -- Bank of Japan Governor 
Yasushi Mieno urged financial institutions Wednesday [9 
February] to work harder to clear their mountains of bad loans 
in line with Finance Ministry guidelines issued the day before. 
  At a regular press conference, he also welcomed Tuesday's 
record 15.25 trillion yen economic stimulus package as 
"appropriate" for helping spur the long-flagging economy. But 
Mieno said his view has not changed that the economy remains 
weak with no clear signs of recovery amid a continued mix of 
good and bad signs. Even if banks should have to post losses -- 
long a taboo in the Japanese financial system -- to write off 
the bad loans they hold, that "would not be a grave thing" 
because of their underlying strength, Mieno said. 
  Stressing the importance of financial institutions' own 
efforts to dispose of problem loans, he urged them to do more 
than they have so far in clearing the loans, a hangover from 
speculative excesses of the late 1980s that continue to weigh on 
bank lending. He urged them to make the efforts in line with 
ministry guidelines included in Tuesday's pump-priming package. 
  The guidelines propose establishing an institution to 
shoulder bad loans expanding special write-offs to cover 
"restructured" loans, those in danger of default on which 
lenders have lowered interest rates or forgiven some repayment 
obligations. 
  But Mieno declined to endorse calls to require banks to 
report the restructured loans on their books. Only loans to 
bankrupt enterprises and those at least six months in arrears on 
interest payments must now be disclosed, prompting calls for 
more openness. 
  Mieno pointed to a government panel report issued last year 
that called for gradual improvement in disclosure while taking 
into account possible disruptions it would cause in the 
financial system. 
  On the economy, he referred to the recent bright spots of 
stabilizing corporate sentiment and smoothly proceeding 
inventory adjustment. But he said they remain pitted against 
such minus factors as a gradually worsening employment situation 
and time-consuming adjustments in corporate balance sheets. 
  As a step to help revive the still-stagnant economy, Mieno 
praised Tuesday's stimulus package, citing its record size, its 
inclusion of income tax cuts and proposals for financial 
deregulation. He noted some "supply-demand uneasiness" in the 
bond market, which fears that the flood of new government bonds 
needed to finance the pump-priming package could overrun market 
demand and push interest rates higher. 
  Recent rises in longer-term market rates also reflect 
recovering stock prices and a correction from earlier large 
falls in rates, Mieno said. 
  Asked about banks' recent 0.3 percentage point hikes in 
their 
long-term prime rates, the first in eight months, he said they 
would not hurt the economy as rates remain at historically low 
levels. 
  Mieno played down last week's hike in a key U.S. overnight 
interbank lending rate, the first such tightening in five years. 
"I don't think it will have a big, immediate effect on the 
currency markets," he said. He noted that his U.S. counterpart 
Alan Greenspan said in hiking the federal funds rate that it had 
been too low and that interest rates should be neutral to ensure 
long-term economic expansion.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 9 KYODO -- A government panel on 
Wednesday [9 February] called for a tax system reform and 
further spending cuts in order to rebuild Japan's fiscal 
standing. 
  The Fiscal System Council, an advisory body to the Finance 
Minister, endorsed bond issuance for the government's new 
stimulus package as "an exceptional and inevitable option" under 
the current economic and fiscal conditions. But ways of 
repaying such bonds should be ensured in a tax system reform the 
government promised to make by the end of this year, the panel 
said in a report. 
  The report was presented to Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii 
on Wednesday so that recommendations can be reflected in the 
fiscal 1994 budget, to be formulated shortly. 
  Speaking before a press conference, Eiji Suzuki, the head of 
the panel, voiced concern over the government's failure to 
secure a specific way of financing the 5.85 trillion yen tax cut 
envisioned in the latest pump-priming package. The government 
coffers would be eroded further without funds to cover the tax 
cuts, the report said, citing a call for the government to carry 
out its pledged tax system reform "in a responsible manner." 
  The report noted Japan's tax revenues, which dropped in 
fiscal 1991 and 1992, are expected to slip substantially in 
fiscal 1993. 
  As a way to strengthen Japan's fiscal base, the panel, in a 
separate report, urged all-out government efforts to slash 
spending. The report called for a drastic review of spending 
allocations for public projects, budget areas widely viewed as 
rigid due to turf battles among ministries. 
  In order to get rid of this rigidity, the panel recommended 
setting priority areas based on actual spending needs. 
  Required spending cuts cited by the report also include 
social security, education, defense, agriculture and 
transportation.

  [Text] Fukuoka, Feb. 9 KYODO -- The head of Japan's most 
powerful business lobby on Wednesday [9 February] called on the 
government to implement sweeping tax reforms. 
  Speaking at a news conference in this southwestern city of 
Kyushu, Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic 
Organizations (Keidanren) said, "the government needs to figure 
out ways, with a public consensus, to secure financial sources 
to cover tax cuts, taking full account of the rapid aging of 
Japanese society." He was referring to the government's 
decision Tuesday to slash income and other taxes worth 5.47 
trillion yen as part of a pump-priming package aimed at lifting 
the flagging economy out of the doldrums. 
  The government is to form a consultative body to discuss the 
funding question for enactment by the end of the year. 
  Hiraiwa sought an early implementation of the 15.25 trillion 
yen economy-boosting package, saying a delay would sap its 
effect on the economy.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 9 KYODO -- A government tax panel 
issued its report on fiscal 1994 tax reform Wednesday [9 
February], endorsing the income tax cut but expressing regret 
over its insufficient discussions. The report handed to Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa also features tax breaks to encourage 
housing purchases, the correction of unfair tax treatments and 
liquor tax hikes. 
  The Tax Commission, an advisory panel to the prime minister, 
considers the income tax cut as "unavoidable for a limited 
one-year period...As an emergency escape to find a way out of 
the economic slump." 
  But it calls for "appropriate measures over financial 
burdens 
caused by the temporary income tax cuts," and stresses that the 
tax plan is against the panel's November "medium-term" report 
that recommends a "single dealing" of an income tax cut and a 
hike in the consumption tax. 
  Speaking at a press meeting after handing over the report, 
panel chairman Kan Kato said he expressed his "regret" to 
Hosokawa that the panel was not given sufficient time to discuss 
its proposals thoroughly. 
  The government and ruling coalition parties decided Tuesday 
on the 20 percent income tax cut, totaling 5.47 trillion yen, 
but left aside the funding issue by setting up a forum to 
discuss it for enactment as law by the end of the year. 
  The tax plan was included in a record 15.25 billion yen 
economic stimulus package unveiled later Tuesday. 
  Kato urged the forum to promptly decide on tax reform bills 
based on the November report, and said his panel would also 
continue studying the issue to win public support. But he also 
noted that the government and coalition debate over the tax 
issue helped raise public interest, and repeated that the 
funding problems should be settled in "six months" while that 
interest remains high. 
  The report spells out that the panel "recognizes (the tax 
plan) as a bridge toward realizing the tax reform" for a 
balanced tax system among income, consumption and assets to cope 
with the aging of the population. 
  Meanwhile, the panel also supports the government's planned 
inheritance tax cuts, and the abolition of special corporate 
tax, and a higher consumption tax rate on passenger cars. The 
report endorses "appropriate" tax incentives to spur housing and 
other effective use of land, but notes that the basic framework 
decided in fiscal 1993 tax reforms to prevent a revival of 
speculation and a land price boom must be maintained. 
  On unfair tax treatment, the panel recommends raising the 
special low tax rate or lowering the tax exemption amount, 
currently at 30 percent, on donations to religious and other 
nonprofit organizations. 
  As for entertainment expenses which are seen to be used by 
companies to evade corporate tax, the panel wants the government 
to levy a given proportion of the current amount of tax 
exemption at smaller businesses. 
  Concerning the punitive heavy tax on unexplained expenses 
proposed earlier by the coalition parties, the panel thinks it 
should be "temporary" because the effects on corporate 
activities and tax enforcement are unpredictable. 
  The panel also calls for reviewing special tax treatments on 
mass media and six other designated businesses and rewards to 
medical practitioners under the social security program. 
  The report approves the tax hikes on beer and other liquor 
decided earlier by the government.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 9 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry is 
planning to raise the fees of state-run universities by around 
36,000 yen to 447,600 yen per year. The increase is to take 
into account the possibility of a large shortfall in tax revenue 
and a widening gap with the fees of private universities, 
ministry officials said Wednesday [9 February]. 
  The ministry intends to apply the new fees to those who 
enter 
state universities in April 1995. The plan, if approved, would 
be incorporated into its budget proposal for fiscal 1994, which 
starts in April. 
  The fees of state-owned universities were hiked in fiscal 
1991 and 1993 by 36,000 yen each. 
  Private universities have raised fees almost every year, 
with 
average fees for students majoring in liberal arts standing at 
587,900 yen a year, those majoring in engineering at 787,900 yen 
and those majoring in medicine at 2,444,700 yen.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 9 KYODO -- Japan plans to issue a 
record 36.53 trillion yen in government bonds in the coming 
fiscal year, up 6.61 trillion yen from its plan in the initial 
fiscal 1993 budget, the Finance Ministry said Wednesday [9 
February]. That will break the record 29.92 trillion yen 
initially planned for the current fiscal year ending March 31, 
said a ministry official. 
  The government boosted its bond issuance plan for fiscal 
1993 
to 37.79 trillion yen through two sets of extra budgets and is 
to increase it further with a third one slated for release 
Thursday. The fiscal 1994 forecast includes deficit-covering 
bonds but their amount will not be officially decided until a 
cabinet meeting Thursday morning, the official said. 
  Government bond issuance in the private sector is expected 
to 
rise 7.56 trillion yen in fiscal 1994 from this fiscal year's 
initial plan to 28.76 trillion yen, but the total amount 
digested by the public sector will likely dip by 95 billion yen 
to 7.77 trillion yen, the report said. It forecast the amount 
of government bonds placed in public auction will climb by 4.36 
trillion yen to 16.56 trillion yen, with big increases in both 
four and six-year issues for which the official cited strong 
demand. 
  But despite the inflated supply of bonds in the market, the 
ministry official said there was "no big concern" over rising 
rates as the economy remains stagnant and credit policy remains 
loose. 
  The dip in public-sector handling of bonds will result from 
a 
1.70 trillion yen drop to 3.69 trillion yen by the ministry's 
trust fund bureau, as its ability to buy bonds is restricted by 
tight budgets, the official said. But he said the ministry has 
sought the help of underwriting syndicates to pick up the slack, 
with the report saying their purchases will rise 3.20 trillion 
yen to 12.20 trillion yen. 
  Purchases by the Bank of Japan should rise 2.62 trillion yen 
to 2.82 trillion yen as it rolls over expiring issues in its 
holdings.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry will 
permit tax-exempt write-offs of some bad loans by Japanese banks 
and other financial institutions, ministry officials said Friday 
[4 February]. 
  The move, beginning in the current fiscal year ending March 
31, is intended to speed up the liquidation of bad loans to 
housing loan companies and other debt-ridden nonbank financial 
institutions, the officials said. 
  Under present plans, financial institutions will create new 
companies to buy their interest-exempted loans to nonbanks. 
  The institutions, which have exempted interest payments on 
some loans to help bail out debt-ridden loan recipients, will be 
allowed to make tax-free write-offs of losses from the selling 
of loans. Write-offs of interest-exempted loans, tax-free or 
otherwise, have not been allowed since they are intended to help 
the bailout of loan recipients.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- Government officials 
started final negotiations Tuesday [8 February] to coordinate 
views on a projected 2.4 percent growth target for Japan's gross 
domestic product (GDP) for fiscal 1994, beginning April 1. The 
negotiations also cover a projected 2.6 percent growth target 
for gross national product (GNP) for the year, the officials 
said. 
  GNP, the value of goods and services produced by a country, 
includes income remitted to Japan by Japanese companies and 
individuals here or Japanese companies overseas. GDP does not. 
  The final targets may be revised upward from the projections 
under study, since the Finance Ministry and the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry (MITI) are calling for a GDP 
growth target ranging from 2.5 to 3.0 percent, the officials 
said. But the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) has insisted on a 
growth target of slightly over 2.0 percent, in the belief that 
full economic recovery will be delayed until the second half of 
fiscal 1994. 
  The estimate for GNP growth in fiscal 1993 is likely to be 
cut to 0.2 percent from the initial forecast of 3.3 percent, the 
officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 9 KYODO -- Japan's governing coalition 
adopted a broad fiscal 1994 budget platform Wednesday [9 
February], calling for special attention to be paid to smaller 
businesses and job security. The seven-party coalition 
indicated that the government's budget should show concern for 
the running of small and mid-sized firms and for stabilizing 
employment conditions, areas particularly affected by the 
nation's prolonged recession. 
  The coalition, which also issued a tax reform platform, 
presented its view on the budget for the fiscal year starting in 
April, the draft of which will be presented to the government by 
the Finance Ministry on Thursday. 
  In line with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's emphasis on 
turning government attention toward improving people's standard 
of living, the platform calls for rethinking budget priorities 
and reviewing the long-fixed system of public works projects. 
  The coalition called for measures as soon as possible, in 
the 
wake of December's agreement settling the Uruguay Round of world 
trade talks, for reforming Japanese agriculture, including 
training to keep younger generations on the farm and 
revitalizing remote mountain communities. 
  On the international front, the coalition platform calls for 
increasing the number of diplomats, improving Official 
Development Assistance and actively addressing such global 
issues as environmental problems and drug abuse.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- Japan's economy remains in a 
slump, with almost all sectors showing no vitality whatsoever, 
the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said Tuesday [8 February]. 
In a monthly economic diagnosis virtually unchanged from the 
previous month's, the agency said, "The Japanese economy is 
going through an adjustment phase and showing an overall slump." 
  The agency said both consumers and corporations remain 
tight-fisted, despite a few signs in personal spending which 
some analysts say might indicate a pickup. An agency official 
briefing reporters on the report said there are some such signs, 
such as upturns in household spending and recovery in department 
store sales and in durable goods sales. 
  But all of them are unconvincing as they are caused by 
temporary factors rather than by a steadfast change in the 
consumer trend. "We have to watch these more carefully," the 
official said. 
  The EPA report also noted that inventory reductions have 
hardly progressed recently, leaving industrial production 
sluggish. With their finances under a squeeze, corporations are 
pessimistic over the future of their businesses, it said. 
  On the labor front, the jobless rate has steadily increased 
while job offers have decreased, particularly in the 
manufacturing sector. 
  The only bright spots, the report said, are public works 
spending, boosted by the government's efforts to galvanize the 
economy, booming housing construction, resulting from low 
interest rates, and stable prices.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 9 KYODO -- The Economic Planning Agency 
(EPA) set a fiscal 1994 growth target for Japan's real gross 
domestic product (GDP) of 2.4 percent Wednesday [9 February]. 
The forecast 2.4 percent growth target for the year starting 
April 1 marks the lowest since the government set a target of 
2.5 percent in fiscal 1974 on a real gross national product 
(GNP) basis. 
  The latest EPA forecast is much higher than the less than 1 
percent projected by most private think tanks. It represents 
the agency's perception that the economy will shift to a 
full-fledged recovery track by the end of the next fiscal year. 
  The 2.4 percent growth comprises a 3.0 percent rise in 
domestic demand and a 0.6 percent shrinkage in external demand, 
the officials said. They said the agency forecasts a current 
account surplus for the year of 13.8 trillion yen, against the 
14.4 trillion yen projected for the current year. 
  Consumer prices are forecast to rise 1.5 percent and 
wholesale prices 0.2 percent. 
  The GNP growth projection for this fiscal year was revised 
down to 0.2 percent from initially projected 3.3 percent, the 
officials said. 
  The projections, reported to Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa 
on Wednesday, will be finalized at a meeting of cabinet 
ministers responsible for economic matters on Thursday.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- The gloomy economy in Japan 
has cut into both the number of travelers going abroad and those 
acquiring passports, a Foreign Ministry report released Thursday 
[3 February] said. The number of ordinary passports issued in 
1993 was 4,663,372, down from 4,677,020 from the previous year, 
the report said. 
  January and February marked the largest drop in passports 
issued in 1993, each slipping 13 percent compared with the same 
months in 1992, the report said. It attributed the decreases to 
the sluggish economy. 
  But the high yen and low-priced travel packages offered by 
travel agencies to boost overseas trips pushed up slightly the 
number of document issued in the latter half of the year, it 
said. 
  Of the total, men accounted for 51 percent and women 49 
percent, the report said. 
  The number of women obtaining passports continued to rise, 
up 
60,000 from the previous year, while the figure for men fell by 
70,000, it said. 
  Women aged 19 or younger and those in their 20s also 
outnumbered men, while women in their 70s and 80s receiving 
passports marked a record high at 46 percent, it said. 
  The report also found that the number of Japanese who lost 
or 
had their passports stolen in and out of Japan increased to a 
total 31,308. 
  Although the number of instances in which diplomatic offices 
abroad had to issue new passports decreased by 5 percent to 
4,154 cases, there were 27,154 cases requiring Japan to reissue 
the document, it said.

  [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in 
Japanese at 2238 GMT on 5 February carries, during its weekly 
"News 2001" program, a 74-minute interview with Shinseito 
Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa. The program, which is moderated 
by Yuji Kuroiwa and Kaori Matsuyama, includes regular guests 
freelance commentator Kenichi Takemura and Keio University 
Professor Yoshiaki Kobayashi. 
  At 2239 GMT, regarding the process of proposing the national 
welfare tax announced by Prime Minister Hosokawa, Ozawa says the 
tax reform system has been discussed among the ruling coalition 
parties for a long time, and the proposed tax did not crop up 
suddenly. He notes the need for substantial discussion on the 
tax system. Takemura, noting Social Democratic Party of Japan 
(SDPJ) opposition to the Hosokawa-proposed national welfare tax, 
says the media have reported that two or three people, including 
Ozawa, decided on the tax without consulting with the SDPJ. In 
reply, Ozawa says the proposed tax was announced after 
discussion among the coalition parties. Asked about the timing 
for deciding on ways to raise funds for the tax cuts, Ozawa 
says: "I have no objection to spending several years in making 
the decision. However, implementing tax cuts repeatedly until 
then by issuing deficit-covering national bonds incontinently is 
very bad for the future of Japan. This is like a drug. Issuing 
deficit-covering national bonds is the easy way out." 
  At 2249 GMT, Kazuhide Uekusa, a laboratory man at the 
Stanford University, in a satellite relay from Los Angeles, 
gives his views on the U.S. stance with the 11 February 
Japan-U.S. summit approaching. Asked how the current situation 
concerning the tax debate will affect relations between Japan 
and the United States in future, Ozawa says: "It is true that 
this is of no benefit to Japan-U.S. relations. However, I 
believe the United States is coolly considering whether it is 
appropriate for it to attack Japan out of spite at the present. 
Meanwhile, in Japan, serious discussion should be held among 
the people on the tax system or funds for tax cuts." On the 
policy-deciding system of the ruling coalition, he says: "There 
is no problem with the system." 
  At 2255 GMT -- following a two-minute commercial break -- 
Ozawa discusses the national welfare tax, social welfare, the 
tax system, and other general topics. He says the 
Hosokawa-proposed national welfare tax is necessary to prepare 
for the upcoming aging society. Explaining the current tax 
system, Ozawa states the balance between direct and indirect 
taxes has to be rectified, and stresses the need to improve the 
pension and medical security systems. He casts doubt on the 
effect of income tax reduction as an economic pump-priming 
measure, saying: "Tax reduction for policy purposes, such as 
tax cuts concerning housing and land, is more effective" in 
revitalizing the economy. He then explains how the current 
preferential taxation system has to be remedied. 
  Matsuyama asks about the possibility that Shinseito and 
Komeito will merge as a prelude to reorganization of the 
political world. Ozawa replies: "It is impossible. The mass 
media are trying to emphasize the Shinseito-Komeito line. There 
is no possibility that our party will ally with Komeito to take 
the lead in doing something." Ozawa also denies the possibility 
that the ruling coalition and the Liberal Democratic Party will 
merge to form a large coalition. 
  On what Japanese society ought to be like, he states that a 
society in which personal ability is displayed and personal 
imagination is developed should be established. 
  At 2336 GMT, Ozawa comments on the threat of the DPRK's 
nuclear programs and Japan's crisis control. He says: "I think 
(North Korea) definitely has nuclear arms. Therefore, it has 
delayed talks with the United States on one pretext or another. 
There is no progress in the talks. It has been said that the 
country is just playing for time. I do not think the country 
will accept the IAEA's full-scale inspection of its nuclear 
facilities. I think its nuclear arms have already been 
completed." He predicts a power struggle after Kim Il-song 
steps down, and notes the possibility that there might be 
upheaval on the Korean peninsula. In this connection, Ozawa 
says: "There is no crisis control system in Japanese society." 
Reviewing Japan's diplomacy at the time of the Persian Gulf 
war, Ozawa says Japan lacks the ability to make a quick decision 
on diplomatic affairs. He questions what Japan would do if the 
DPRK took military action and the United Nations, led by the 
United States, tried to deal with it. Ozawa stresses that it is 
important for politicians to make a quick decision and to act 
responsibly. 
  At 2350 GMT -- following a two-minute commercial break -- In 
reply to a question sent via fax by MAINICHI SHIMBUN special 
editor Takao Iwami, Ozawa says the priority political task from 
the medium- to-long term viewpoint is to change the current 
political structure and to establish a political system that 
prevents Japan from being isolated in the international 
community. The interview winds up at 2352 GMT after Ozawa 
stresses the need for all people to cooperate in carrying out 
political reform.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- Public support for the 
cabinet of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has plummeted to 
52.5 percent from 64.7 percent in December following the 
political crisis sparked by his announcement last week of a new 
7 percent indirect tax, the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reported 
Tuesday [8 February]. It was the lowest since Hosokawa formed 
the coalition cabinet last August, the business daily said. 
  Of those questioned, 65.4 percent opposed the "national 
welfare tax," compared with 32.2 percent who supported it. 
  On Monday, TV ASAHI reported that its opinion survey 
indicated a significant 21.1 percentage point decline in the 
cabinet's approval rating to 56.3 percent, down from 77.4 
percent on January 30 after Hosokawa succeeded in getting 
political reform enacted by the Diet. 
  The NIHON KEIZAI's telephone poll, conducted between Friday 
and Sunday, covered 3,000 out of Japan's 94 million voters, of 
whom 1,868 gave valid responses. 
  The poll showed 27.2 percent did not support the cabinet, up 
from December's 14.9 percent. Those who made no clear answer 
reached 20.3 percent, up from 20.5 percent. 
  It said 40.3 percent were dissatisfied that Hosokawa decided 
on the new tax "without full debate" and 37.3 percent opposed 
the process of decision-making in which "an abrupt decision" was 
reached "in closed-door sessions." 
  The poll indicated 19.0 percent voiced full-fledged or 
qualified support for the decision-making process. 
  The opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) was the most 
popular among political parties at 28.0 percent, up from 23.2 
percent in December, followed by the Social Democratic Party at 
12.8 percent, up from 11.2 percent, Shinseito at 10.3 percent, 
down from 12.1 percent, and the Japan New Party at 9.4 percent, 
down from 14.6 percent. 
  Asked who they support most among nine leading politicians, 
17.5 percent said former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, 14.4 
percent House of Representatives speaker Takako Doi, 12.6 
percent LDP Policy Affairs Research Council chairman Ryutaro 
Hashimoto, and 11.1 percent Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
Hosokawa was not among the nine.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- Land prices in Japan were 
continuing to fall as of January 1 due to Japan's prolonged 
economic slump, the National Land Agency said in a survey 
released Tuesday [8 February]. 
  The agency made a spot survey on 849 sites in residential 
and 
commercial districts of both big and smaller cities, including 
Japan's major centers of Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka. The survey is 
conducted once every three months. 
  Of 522 residential tracts, prices on 88 were down 
substantially, an increase from the 81 recorded in the previous 
three-month-period survey, while prices on 163 fell slightly, 
down from 139, and prices on 264 remained flat, up from 258. 
  Prices fell across the board on the 327 commercial sites.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry will 
abolish its system of automatically imposing a limit on loans to 
the real estate industry when certain conditions are met, 
ministry officials said Friday [4 February]. The "trigger 
system," introduced in 1991 to control growth in loans to the 
industry, has never been put into force. 
  The system will be abandoned under the new financial policy 
guidelines that the ministry will announce after the government 
comes out with its new pump-priming package on or after 
Saturday, the officials said. 
  Abolition of the system is unlikely to rekindle the kind of 
serious land price inflation that Japan experienced during the 
years of the inflationary bubble from the late 1980s to the 
early 1990s, the officials said. 
  Loans to the real estate industry by banks and other 
financial institutions have remained at a low level in recent 
years due to the economic recession. 
  The Finance Ministry introduced the trigger system in 1991, 
when it abolished its arrangement for limiting the growth of 
loans to the real estate industry to less than that of total 
loans to all industries. 
  The officials said the trigger system will be abolished to 
help activate land transactions and promote business recovery.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- The government Tuesday [8 
February] decided on outlays of 230 billion yen in its package 
of economic stimuli for strengthening the nation's agriculture, 
government officials said. 
  The spending, included among the additional outlays for 
public works projects, is aimed primarily at improving the 
foundation of agriculture and expanding the scale of farms, they 
said. The decision is a follow-up to a new global trade 
agreement reached last December under the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The Uruguay Round accord calls for 
opening Japan's rice market to imports. 
  Of the total expenditures for beefing up agriculture, 145 
billion yen will be allocated by the government itself, 
officials said. 
  Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Eijiro Hata had 
high marks for the decision, saying, "The stage has been set 
(for dealing adequately with the effect of the Uruguay Round 
agreement on domestic farmers)."

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 27 KYODO -- Job transfers have forced 
some 481,000 men, or some 1 percent of male employees, to live 
apart from their wives and children, the Management and 
Coordination Agency said in a survey released Thursday [3 
February]. Such job-related family separations recorded up to 
October 1992 soared by 62,000 or almost 15 percent over 1987, 
the year of the previous survey on job transfers, and a further 
increase can be anticipated, according to the survey. 
  "Due to problems such as children's schooling or house 
ownership, the number of fathers leaving their families behind 
when taking up a new job is likely to continue to increase," the 
survey said. The higher the number of employees at a company, 
the more likely that employees will be assigned to a post in 
another city without their families. 
  Such male employees are most often to be found among those 
in 
the middle echelons of management. The vast majority, about 70 
percent, are in their 40s or 50s. 
  These facts further corroborate the stereotyped image of the 
salarymen living apart from his family as being "middle 
management staff with a major company," the survey said. Most 
men living a job-related single life had been transferred to 
Tokyo, some 59,000, followed by 35,000 assigned to new posts in 
Kanagawa Prefecture, and 30,000 working in Chiba Prefecture.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: "The Very Dangerous </F>
Bellicose Absurd Remarks"] 
  [Text] According to broadcast reports from Seoul, Han 
Sung-chu, who is called the minister of the puppet Foreign 
Ministry, raved about some kind of dialogue to resolve the 
nuclear issue of the North at the conference of heads of 
overseas missions. He added bellicose absurd remarks that when 
circumstances do not permit dialogue, it was also the 
government's consistent stance to take strict measures against 
the North. 
  These very dangerous provocative absurd remarks are leading 
the situation on the Korean peninsula to a phase of war 
[chonjaeng kungmyon] and are outraging our people. 
  As everyone knows, the whole world recognizes that the 
nuclear issue in our country is an issue to be resolved between 
us and the United States. The reason the nuclear issue has been 
raised on the Korean peninsula is because the United States is 
increasing the risk of nuclear war [haekchonjaeng wihom] by 
introducing more than 1,000 nuclear weapons of various types to 
South Korea; is deploying them in forward positions in the areas 
adjacent to the Military Demarcation Line; and is conducting 
nuclear war exercises, including the Team Spirit military 
exercise, against the Northern half of the Republic every day. 
  Therefore, the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula should 
be resolved between us and the United States -- the party that 
introduced nuclear weapons to South Korea and that is increasing 
the risk of nuclear war. The South Korean puppets are not 
qualified to interfere in the resolution of the nuclear issue on 
the Korean peninsula. They only have to act according to the 
decisions made through negotiations between us and the United 
States. 
  If the South Korean puppets have anything to say concerning 
the nuclear issue, they should frankly apologize to all nations 
for bringing U.S. nuclear weapons to the land of South Korea to 
spread nuclear disaster among their fellow countrymen and for 
increasing the risk of nuclear war with the United States, and 
should ask to be given due punishment. It is intolerable that 
Han Sung-chu did not mention one word about this in his attempt 
to interfere in the resolution of the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula. 
  It is ridiculous that the South Korean puppets, which can 
hardly be called human beings as they are first-class colonial 
hunting dogs and flunkyist nation-sellers, are trying to 
interfere in the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula. 
  What cannot be overlooked is that South Korean puppets are 
raving about some kind of resolute measures while the United 
States is threatening ultimatums by setting a deadline for us to 
accept the full-scope inspection [chonmyon sachal] of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. 
  The South Korean puppets have so far made innumerable 
criminal outbursts disparaging us under the pretext of the 
nuclear issue. However, considering the fact that they spat out 
more belligerent outbursts, such as a stern measure, we can be 
well aware that the rascals' new war provocation moves have 
entered a very grave stage. 
  The South Korean puppets have committed every strategic move 
to frustrate the DPRK-U.S. talks during the past period. Today, 
the process of peaceful solution of the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula is facing a crisis situation because of the 
betrayal of the United States [onul migugui paesin 
haengwirohaeso chosonbando haengmunjeui pyonghwajok haegyol 
kwajongi wigi sanghwange noigedoeja]. With this situation as a 
motive, the South Korean puppets are frantically running wild to 
prevent the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks from being realized 
and to bring about a nuclear war in our country, which will 
annihilate the entire nation in collusion with foreign forces. 
  Under the pretext of the so-called meeting, Han Sung-chu 
will 
visit the United States from 16 to 22 February, meet with the 
U.S. President and secretary of state, establish the final U.S. 
and ROK position, and discuss a follow-up measure regarding the 
IAEA decision based on the North's attitude. This is one of the 
criminal moves to crush the fellow countrymen in collusion with 
foreign forces. 
  Even Han Sung-chu babbled about dialogue, this is nothing 
but 
a brazen-faced maneuver to cover up their antinational, 
antipeaceful, and antireunification activity, which is driving 
our country's situation into the brink of a war. 
  It is unreasonable for the South Korean puppets, who are 
trying to enforce the large-scale nuclear war exercise against 
our Republic in collusion with the United States and deploy 
Patriot missiles to South Korea, to talk about holding dialogue 
with us. 
  Babbling about dialogue while wielding guns [chongdae] is, 
in 
fact, an insult to dialogue and negation of dialogue. Han 
Sung-chu confessed that a stern measure is a consistent 
position. Thus, the unchangeable real intention of the puppets, 
who are not interested in North-South dialogue at all and are 
trying to separate and crush our Republic in collusion with 
foreign forces, becomes clearer. 
  Facts show that the South Korean puppets are rushing toward 
the road to North-South confrontation and war, not toward peace 
and peaceful reunification, and that they do not hesitate to 
endanger the entire nation with a nuclear holocaust. 
  The entire nation set this year as the year for the great 
national unity and is accelerating the great advance for 
national reunification. The South Korean puppets, however, are 
taking the road to war and are the traitorous group that cannot 
live together under the same sky. 
  The South Korean puppets should look straight at our 
people's 
will and determination and act with discretion. The rascals' 
reckless new war provocation will only result in their own 
destruction.

  [Text] The ROK Government plans to significantly beef up 
the checklist, which includes North Korea's military movement, 
to find signs of North Korean provocations as early as possible. 
  By so doing, the government intends to prepare for the 
possibility that the North Korean nuclear issue will be 
presented to the UN Security Council when the nuclear 
negotiations between North Korea and the International Atomic 
Energy Agency fail. The government has comprehensively analyzed 
North Korea's status of the accumulation of military materiel 
and other indications by using the intelligence capabilities of 
the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces Command. 
  A high-ranking government official said: "Even though major 
military facilities of North Korea have been reportedly built 
underground, the Combined Forces Command's intelligence 
capabilities can fully detect them." He also said: "Still, the 
government will further beef up this list and strengthen its 
intelligence capabilities against North Korea."

<F P=106> [By Raymond Burgos] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Nationalist Revolutionary Alliance [RAM], 
the rightist military rebel group that mounted several coup 
attempts against the previous administration, yesterday threw 
its support behind the groundswell of protest against increases 
in oil prices, power rates and transport fares. It also gave 
tacit approval to the bombings of the offices of three oil 
companies by the leftist Alex Boncayao Brigade [ABB]. 
  "We believe it is the right of the people to protest in the 
loudest possible manner, and RAM will be a participant in the 
planned protest actions," Captain Danilo Lim, RAM spokesperson, 
said in a televised interview. Church, labor, consumer and even 
business groups have also joined the clamor for a rollback in 
fuel prices. 
  Lim described the attacks on the oil company offices as "the 
only language which the government understands. Such bombings 
are being conducted since only through such acts can the people 
capture the attention of the government," he said. 
  In a separate interview on radio, Gregorio "Gringo" Honasan, 
who led several of the coup attempts, urged the government to 
heed the public outcry or face worsening violence. At the same 
time, however, he appealed for sobriety and for earnest 
dialogues. "We need a sober approach. We are on the side of the 
protesters because the impact is serious, but let us focus (our 
efforts)," he said. "The choices are we either fight each other 
again or sit down and talk about how we can help one another." 
Another rightwing rebel, Proceso Maligalig, who is involved in 
peace talks with the government, said: "We should be 
dispassionate about this. We should be rational about it. This 
could be the start of a serious problem." 
  In the provinces: 
  -- The multisectoral People's Initiative to Denounce and 
Reject Oil (Price Increases), or PIDRO, called off a rally 
scheduled in Davao City on Sunday, the day Malaysian Prime 
Minister Mahathir bin Mohamed visits Davao. 
  -- Students and non-government organizations plan a big 
protest rally today in Baguio. A bigger rally is set for 9 
February to coincide with the general strikes planned in Metro 
Manila, Davao and Cagayan de Oro cities. 
  -- A similar mass action is scheduled today in lloilo 
City, regional center of Western Visayas. 
  -- Three radio stations in Cebu City whose commentators 
have reportedly been urging people to join a civil disobedience 
movement are under fire from the National Telecommunications 
Commission [NTC]. 
  The National Bureau of Investigation, meanwhile, released a 
sketch of one of four men believed to have lobbed sticks of 
dynamite at Petron and Shell buildings in Makati last Tuesday. 
On that day, too, a bomb was hurled at the Caltex office in 
Manila. 
  President Ramos reiterated an appeal for sobriety and 
solidarity "so as not to jeopardize our efforts for national 
recovery. Panic and extremist actions can only result in higher 
inflation, fewer jobs, reduced investment, trade and tourism, 
and delayed growth," Mr. Ramos said at the opening of the 
two-day conference of the Federation of Industrial Security 
Organization of the Philippines. [passage omitted] 
  "It is not the people who should bear the brunt of the 
government's excessive spending and blind obedience to the 
dictation of powerful forces outside the government," Lim said. 
Echoing a common sentiment aired by other protest groups, he 
said the Ramos administration could look for other ways to raise 
revenues than increase the price of gasoline and other petroleum 
products. 
  In Camp Crame, top police officials and security officers of 
government and private installations agreed in a meeting to 
adopt "airtight defenses to thwart further sabotage around their 
facilities." Police officials said these measures would include 
security in and around power, oil, water and communications 
facilities. "We are not taking any chances despite the 
pronouncement of the ABB to hold off further attacks in Metro 
Manila," said Director Pedro Sistoza, deputy chief for 
administration of the Philippine National Police. 
  Present at the meeting were security chiefs of Caltex 
Philippines Inc., Pilipinas [Philippines] Shell, Petron, Meralco 
[Manila Electric Company], Philippine Long Distance Telephone 
Co., Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System, National Power 
Corp. and the Energy Regulatory Board. [passage omitted] 
  The National Telecommunications Commission will investigate 
radio stations DYLA, DYRB and DYFX in Cebu for their 
commentators' advocacy of civil disobedience as a form of 
protest. Danilo Sy, NTC regional director, said he would ask 
officials of the three stations to explain why their 
commentators were allowed to make statements that could cause 
public unrest. DYLA is owned by the Associated Labor Union-Trade 
Union Congress of the Philippines (ALU-TUCP). DYRB belongs to 
defeated presidential candidate Eduardo Cojuangco, and DYFX has 
the Iglesia ni Cristo [Church of Christ] as its major 
stockholder. 
  Rally organizers in Davao City put off their mass action in 
response to an appeal from Mayor Rodrigo Duterte to hold their 
rally any day except on the day of Mahathir's visit. The 
organizers also had a dialogue with Duterte's chief of staff, 
Leoncio Evasco. Duterte later promised to provide government 
vehicles to transport protesters from the countryside to the 
city center. "I would like to extend my gratitude to whoever 
were planning to stage a mass action for their understanding," 
he said. Duterte said he would not join a rally set for Monday 
by the militant People Against Oil Price Increase because "the 
greater interest of the people requires that I support President 
Ramos. My duty is to assure that the government remains stable," 
he said.

  [Text] According to Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin, 
the economic impact on Thailand of the lifting of the U.S. trade 
embargo against Vietnam will be assessed and followed closely by 
the Finance Ministry and the Bank of Thailand. 
  He said the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo will result in 
the Vietnamese economy being more active. This will result in 
increased trade and investment activities which will benefit 
Thailand. The finance minister believes foreign investment in 
Vietnam will increase and that Vietnam will benefit from the 
investment and improve its economic position. However, this 
will not result in Vietnam drawing the capital market away from 
Thailand. This is because Vietnam and Thailand have different 
development and technological bases. Foreign investors in 
Vietnam will be attracted by the cheap labor, while in Thailand 
investors emphasize value added products. As a result, there is 
no fear of market competition. 
  Tharin said: "In fact, increased investment in Vietnam will 
benefit Thai businessmen because it will result in investment 
opportunities, such as in the construction sector."

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 9 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata, leaving on short notice for Washington on Wednesday 
evening [9 February], said he will try to resolve the 
differences on trade between Japan and the United States before 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's summit meeting with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton. Hata said he will try to break the 
deadlock between trade negotiators of the two countries so that 
Hosokawa and Clinton can look back on the results of the talks 
with satisfaction when they meet Friday. 
  The foreign minister, who was originally scheduled to depart 
for Washington along with Hosokawa on Thursday, said he was 
leaving early on instructions from the premier. He said his 
schedule in Washington has yet to be fixed. 
  Hata, who doubles as deputy prime minister, said he will 
impress upon his U.S. interlocutors how determinedly the present 
administration has been in its attempts to revive the Japanese 
economy and stimulate increased imports from the U.S. and other 
countries. He suggested there is a lack of understanding in the 
U.S. Government in that regard. 
  Hosokawa and Clinton are scheduled to assess progress in the 
bilateral economic talks being held under a trade framework 
accord concluded last July. Hata said he wants to tackle the 
matter before the summit begins, so that the two leaders can 
have broad discussions on areas other than the economy. 
  Asked about the idea of setting numerical targets to gauge 
the openness of Japanese markets, Hata did not dismiss it out of 
hand, saying instead, "we will discuss the matter keeping in 
mind the potential implications, including what the implications 
could be internationally." 
  But Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura suggested 
earlier Wednesday that Tokyo will continue to oppose such a 
move. "In the negotiations, the Japanese Government has taken 
the stance that it is very difficult to accept the proposal for 
numerical targets," he said. 
  Takemura added he believes Hata "will finalize political 
negotiations before the summit in line with this basic stance."

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 9 KYODO -- A Japanese career 
diplomat on a mission to break an impasse in Japan-U.S. 
framework trade talks met U.S. President Bill Clinton on Tuesday 
[9 February], informed sources said Wednesday. 
  Akitane Kiuchi, who has served as ambassador to Malaysia, 
Thailand and France, is visiting Washington as a special envoy 
of Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, they said. 
  Kiuchi conveyed to Clinton a message from Hosokawa pledging 
he will try to solve issues with sincerity, the sources said. 
Clinton was quoted as saying it is time for the two sides to 
upgrade negotiations to the cabinet-minister level. 
  Hosokawa told reporters in Tokyo on Wednesday that the trade 
negotiations have been deadlocked over U.S. demands for 
"objective criteria" for measuring the degree of foreign access 
to the Japanese market. 
  Hosokawa is due to leave Tokyo for Washington on Thursday to 
hold talks with Clinton on Friday.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar January 27 TASS--An inter-governmental 
agreement between Mongolia, Russia and China on the 
determination of junction points of state borders of the three 
states has been signed in the capital of Mongolia today. This 
was a result of joint strenuous work of experts for a year 
because border issues demanded urgent settlement. 
  The adoption of a such a document for the first time is an 
evidence of strengthening of mutual respect, sovereignty of each 
of the member states and the development of friendly relations 
between them, as well as the positive changes in international 
relations as a whole. 
  The conclusion of this agreement means for us that Mongolia 
has reached a full agreement on state border issues and thus 
laid the foundation of its stability, Zhalbuugiin Choinkhor, 
Mongolian minister of foreign relations, told ITAR-TASS. 
  Russia and China with respect to Mongolia demonstrated 
respect for such important international principles as 
inviolability of its state borders, its independence and 
territorial integrity. The historical importance of the present 
agreement lies just in all this, the Mongolian minister of 
foreign relations stressed.

NATO. Moscow Keeps Calm"] 
  [Text] Vice Premier C. Purebdorj said that NATO "is not an 
aggressive alliance" today. In the vice premier's opinion, most 
speedy rapprochement with NATO "would have a positive impact on 
strengthening Mongolia's national security as it makes the 
transition to a democratic society." 
  C. Purebdorj told correspondents that a large group of NATO 
experts is due to come to Ulaanbaatar this summer for the first 
time "to establish contacts and hold consultations on national 
security questions." 
  In the opinion of Russian Foreign Ministry experts, the 
Mongolians' view of the North Atlantic bloc is by and large the 
result of a positive attitude to the decisions adopted at the 
last NATO session, in particular, the "Partnership for Peace" 
program. IZVESTIYA was told that diplomats in Moscow have not 
got a complex over this. 
  The European Parliament Commission recently heard a report 
on 
the situation in Mongolia advocating an exchange of 
representatives and the organization of dialogue with the Great 
Hural. The Europeans decided on the advisability of granting 
most-favored-nation status for imports of Mongolian goods to the 
West and also of concluding a partnership treaty. 
  We learned from diplomatic sources in Moscow that Mongolian 
banks have already received 8 million European Currency Units 
from Europe within the framework of the so-called "TACIS" 
economic aid program.

  [Excerpts] The inauguration ceremony for the second 
Myanmar [Burma]-Thailand-Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR] 
tripartite ministerial conference on cooperation in drug abuse 
control was held at 0900 today at the conference hall of the 
International Business Center on Prome Road, Yangon [Rangoon]. 
[passage omitted] 
  In his opening speech, Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt, 
secretary-1 of the State Law and Order Restoration Council 
[SLORC], expressed his pleasure at having the opportunity to 
open the second ministerial conference of the LPDR, Thailand, 
and the Union of Myanmar on cooperation in drug abuse control. 
He said he warmly welcomed the delegates on behalf of the 
government and the people of the Union of Myanmar. He said he 
also welcomed the observers and representatives from Bangladesh, 
the PRC, India, the United Nations Drug Control Program [UNDCP], 
WHO, UNICEF, and FAO. 
  Lt.Gen. Khin Nyunt said that the menace of spreading 
narcotics use is a matter of major international concern, and 
the scourge of illicit drugs trafficked across international 
borders can be successfully overcome through the strength of 
international unity. Myanmar believes that all international 
cooperation at the individual, regional, and international 
levels are necessary for this endeavor. He said Myanmar is 
simultaneously combating narcotics in a national campaign and 
cooperating fully internationally in striving to solve the 
problems of illicit use, production, and traffic in narcotic 
drugs on all fronts. 
  After his speech, Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt cordially greeted 
members of the Thai delegation, led by the deputy prime 
minister; the LPDR delegation led by the Prime Minister's Office 
minister; ambassadors; and representatives from the UN agencies. 
[passage omitted] 
  Speaking at the meeting, Lt. Gen. Mya Thinn, leader of the 
Myanmar delegation, chairman of the Central Committee for Drug 
Abuse Control [CCDAC], and home minister, said the cooperation 
among our three countries, which form part of the infamous 
Golden Triangle, in combating the menace of narcotics will be 
seen as an important milestone in the history of the world. He 
said such an endeavor serves the interests of all humanity. 
  Lt. Gen. Mya Thinn said that the countries attending the 
current conference are part of the region known as the Golden 
Triangle. He said everyone knows who created the Golden 
Triangle and who is smearing its image with black paint. He 
said collective efforts to solve the problem, rather than the 
practice of blaming one another, will gradually bring an end to 
the narcotics problem. 
  He said the history of our country's narcotics problem was 
presented at the first meeting. He said remarkable efforts had 
been made by Myanmar since the first meeting. He said a 
ministry for development of the border regions -- where most of 
the opium is grown -- and national races was formed on 24 
September 1992 and that the Law on the Development of the Border 
Regions and National Races was enacted on 13 August 1993. He 
said one of the objectives of the law is to totally eradicate 
the cultivation of narcotic drugs by establishing economic 
enterprises. He said priority has been given to this task since 
May 1989 and as of the end of 1993, the state has spent kyat 
1,512.4 million for this task. He said the task of eradicating 
opium cultivation in the Kokang Region within six years and the 
Wa Region within 10 years is being carried out in consultation 
with the local national leaders. 
  Lt. Gen. Mya Thinn said agreements had been signed by 
Myanmar, the PRC, and the UNDCP and Myanmar, Thailand, and the 
UNDCP on 12 June 1992 under a joint regional program for 
narcotic drug eradication with financial assistance from the 
UNDCP. Representatives from Laos were invited to attend the 
meetings held by Myanmar. Furthermore, an agreement was signed 
with India on cooperation in combating narcotics on 30 March 
1993 and the first meeting was held in New Delhi on 19 October 
1993. It is hoped that a cooperation agreement with Laos would 
be signed with assistance from the UNDCP. Similar consultations 
will be made with Bangladesh. 
  Lt. Gen. Mya Thinn said cooperative efforts and common 
objectives of the neighboring countries had earned them praise 
from the 36th Conference of the Narcotic Drugs Commission held 
in 29 March-7 April 1993 in Vienna, Austria. The commission 
conference urged West Asia and other regions to take similar 
action. He said another outstanding endeavor was the signing of 
the memorandum of understanding by representatives of Myanmar, 
PRC, Laos, and Thailand on cooperation in combatting illicit 
traffic and use of narcotic drugs on 26 October 1993 at the UN 
Headquarters. 
  Continuing, Lt. Gen. Mya Thinn explained the Narcotic Drugs 
and Psychotropic Substances Law of 27 January 1993. He said 
this law was drafted and promulgated in accordance with the 
provisions of the United Nations Convention Against Illicit 
Traffice in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. He said 
the menace of narcotic drugs is growing while psychotropic 
substances are now infiltrating our countries. In addition, he 
said, the task of banning chemicals used in refining narcotic 
drugs is also very important. 
  Lt.Gen. Mya Thinn explained that there is no illicit 
production of these chemicals in Myanmar and there are strict 
restrictions on the matter and the new law contains effective 
penalites. A constant watch is maintained for illegal traffic 
in these chemicals from neighboring countries. Lt.Gen. Mya 
Thinn said that under the new law, laundering financial proceeds 
from the narcotics trade in the form of movable as well as 
immovable property and bank deposits can be investigated and 
they can be confiscated as public property. He said profit is 
the main motive behind the illicit production and trafficking of 
narcotics, and only when the proceeds can be confiscated as 
public property can its machinery be stopped. Similarly, it is 
necessary to make joint efforts to contain traffic in 
narcotics-related chemicals. 
  What is more important is that the drug traffickers can 
easily move across borders and disregard international 
boundaries. It can be seen that they are even capable of defying 
governments concerned with illegal weapons. Therefore, it is 
about time that countries producing weapons stop this illegal 
trade. Lt.Gen. Mya Thinn said the Cold War is over and all 
countries should join hands in working to combat AIDS -- an 
offshoot of the menace of narcotics -- in the interests of all 
humanity. Therefore, in conclusion, he urged all countries to 
continue to cooperate until success is achieved in accordance 
with the motto: Prevent and combat the menace of narcotic drugs 
which endanger humanity. [passage omitted on speeches by Lao, 
Thai delegates]

  [Excerpts] Kota Kinabalu, Sun. [6 February] -- Kadazans can 
choose from many other capable leaders who are honest, 
hardworking, and who care for the people to lead them, Prime 
Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said today. 
  He said the people of Sabah, particularly the Kadazan/Dusun 
community, should not sacrifice their well-being by supporting 
Parti Bersatu Sabah [Sabah United Party -- PBS] President Datuk 
Sri Joseph Pairin Kitingan's aspiration to continue as the chief 
minister. [passage omitted] 
  Dr. Mahathir said as Sabah was lagging behind in 
development, 
the people now had the opportunity to be on par with their 
counterparts in other states by giving the mandate to the BN in 
the coming elections. He said a Barisan government would be fair 
to all races. "When the BN makes promises, they will be 
delivered," he said to the applause of the large crowd. Dr. 
Mahathir said Barisan had nothing against the PBS but could not 
get along with its leaders, particularly Pairin, who had proven 
himself to be insincere. 
  He said that during the 1990 general election, Pairin played 
out the BN by pulling out of the coalition a few days before 
polling. "Pairin now wants to return to the BN, but how can we 
trust him?" He urged the voters not to be duped by the PBS' 
tactics of confusing the people that UMNO [United Malays 
National Organization] was trying to grab power in the state.

  [Text] Malaysia has requested for support from the 
Ukrainian Government to bring about a justifiable end to the 
conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Foreign Ministry Secretary 
General Tan Sri Ahmad Kamil Jaafar said Malaysia appreciates the 
contribution made by Ukraine in Bosnia, especially to the United 
Nations peacekeeping forces. He said he had requested for 
Ukraine's support to bring about decisive action that Malaysia 
is seeking out with other countries, not only on the (?ground), 
but also in the United Nations. 
  He said this at a press conference after meeting Ukraine's 
deputy foreign minister, A.D. Makarenko, in Kuala Lumpur. Tan 
Sri Ahmad Kamil said the meeting was the beginning of a process 
to upgrade relations both in the political and economic fields, 
including the various trade agreements in the framework for 
economic cooperation. Makarenko said Ukraine was interested in 
sharing its expertise in field products, space program, and the 
aircraft manufacturing industry, especially in the area of large 
cargo planes. [sentence as heard]

  [Text] The misconception about attracting foreign 
investment into ASEAN is that it should come from outside the 
region. In doing so, ASEAN do not realize the immense potential 
in cross-border investment. For far too long, member countries 
have been relying on investments outside ASEAN. This will only 
serve to make the region dependent on others. Besides this, it 
is not in line with efforts toward ASEAN economic integration. 
  The fact is that member countries do not have to go far for 
investment. With regional trade expanding rapidly, there is 
much scope for greater intra-ASEAN investment as well. As Prime 
Minister Datuk Sri Dr Mahathir Mohamed noted, investment by 
ASEAN investors in ASEAN had grown substantially over the years. 
However, the choice by ASEAN investors to place their money in 
the region does not come automatically. It is vital for member 
countries to provide a conducive climate for investment. This 
means that the investment climate must be ideal, with the 
necessary laws and policies in place. 
  ASEAN countries have done well in providing the right 
environment for foreign investment. Still, with other regions 
also competing for investment, member countries must guard 
against complacency. Economies in Eastern Europe, Latin America, 
and Africa are competing for foreign capital to create jobs and 
prosperity. Here, a key to cross-border investment is to 
complement one another's economic mood. This is exactly why the 
growth triangle concept has become very popular in the region. 
It is more effective for a few countries to get together to 
develop their respective regions bordering each other. Within a 
short period of time, the committees in charge of developing the 
growth triangle have swung into action. It is a matter of time 
before they start bearing fruit. 
  The bottom line is that if their investment climate is ideal 
for ASEAN countries, they should also be conducive for investors 
from outside the region. Therefore, there is much scope for not 
only intra-ASEAN trade, but cross-border investments as well 
among member countries. The challenge is for the respective 
private sectors to tap into each other's potential. Rather than 
going for high-cost areas far away, ASEAN countries are among 
the most lucrative investment destinations. Areas that need to 
be looked into to ensure the flow of investments of proper 
infrastructure facilities. [sentence as heard] Efforts should 
be made to enhance skilled manpower in the region. This could 
encourage reverse investment by some of the more developed 
countries in neighboring ASEAN countries. 
  All this would go a long way in boosting the region's quest 
for a single free market. When that is achieved, ASEAN would 
emerge as a cohesive force, much to the envy of others. At the 
same time, it would give the region a better bargaining power in 
international economic issues.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Stop the Serbs -- now"] </F>
  [Text] The time for action on Bosnia was when the problem 
erupted, two years ago. Nothing was done, for reasons ranging 
from desire to keep out of others' wars, to the fear of losing 
them, to disagreement between the members of the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization (NATO). When the Serbs of rump Yugoslavia 
and the Croats began carrying out ethnic cleansing and genocide 
with impunity, the United Nations decided that it would 
intervene to keep the peace. That word was a misnomer, for 
there was no peace to keep. Paralysed by an arms embargo that 
removed their ability to defend themselves, the Bosnian Muslims 
became prey to the barbarities of the Bosnian Serbs. These 
Serbs were abetted by their brothers in Belgrade who, the same 
embargo notwithstanding, enjoyed vast superiority in arms 
because the hardware of the erstwhile Yugoslav military had come 
to their possession. The massacre of Bosnians continued, 
whether through outright shelling or the more insidious sniper 
fire and a siege that kept humanitarian supplies from reaching 
starving and wounded populations. In the meanwhile, out-of-work 
European politicians became famous by flying in and out of 
Sarajevo and Belgrade, trying to achieve a settlement which 
they, more than anyone else, knew existed only in the 
imagination. The reason: the Serbs knew that they did not have 
to make peace, for they were simply doing fine in an unequal 
war. As the world agonised and political leaders looked the 
other way, Bosnians died slowly and painfully. 
  Then, last weekend, the shocking death of 68 people in a 
mortar attack in Sarajevo reminded NATO that it has some 
responsibility for ensuring that the Balkans do not slip 
irreversibly out of the civilised world. Foreign Ministers of 
the European Union (EU) met in Brussels on Monday to issue the 
toughest warning heard in recent months to those strangling 
Sarajevo. After the usual disagreements among themselevs, they 
asked that NATO meet to see how besieged Sarajevo could be 
relieved using all necessary means, including air strikes. But 
even now it is not certain that those necessary means will be 
used. 
  True, air power is not an end in itself. Not only will its 
use endanger the UN peacekeeping forces in Bosnia, will air 
strikes not supported by ground action lead to a Serb 
withdrawal? Who will provide the ground troops? Are NATO 
governments ready to face the political cost of sustaining 
casualties in what may turn out to be a protracted war? In 
terms of realpolitik, is it worth all the effort as long as the 
Bosnian massacre does not grow in a larger European problem? 
That apart, what is the point of undertaking military 
intervention in the absence of a larger, sustainable peace plan 
whose enforcement must be the objective of the military action? 
Is there such a peace plan? 
  These are legitimate questions, but they can also become 
dishonest excuses for doing nothing -- which is exactly how they 
look today. The Serbs need to be punished for what they are 
doing, and prevented from doing what they will do if they are 
not stopped. The demilitarisation of Sarajevo enforced through 
limited air strikes, will remind them that they can be losers in 
an equal war. Strategicaly, the strikes will hold the situation 
while increased diplomatic pressure is brought to bear on the 
Serbs for a political solution. Concurrently, a lifting of the 
arms embargo on Bosnia will enable it to balance the military 
scales for the same purpose: to make the Serbs realise that they 
have to talk real peace. To date, the U.S. has shown more than 
any other NATO member that the plight of the Bosnians means 
anything to the conscience of the civilised world. In the name 
of that civilisation, in the name of the right of a people to 
resist genocide, in the name of innocent Bosnians who are still 
alive, it is the U.S. which needs to lead the way to what needs 
to be done at once: Stop the Serbs.

  [Text] Phnom Penh, Feb 10 (AFP) -- Senior Cambodian 
parliamentarian Son Sann has appealed for a ceasefire between 
the radical Khmer Rouge and government forces, a statement 
released Wednesday said. The ongoing fighting between the Khmer 
Rouge and the government was detrimental to the Cambodian 
people, Son Sann, the leader of the small Buddhist Liberal 
Democratic Party (BLDP), said in the statement. 
  "The Cambodian people...strongly aspire towards peace, a 
widespread and lasting peace which would allow them benefit from 
the proper reconstruction of the country," he added. 
  The BLDP and Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC [National 
United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and 
Cooperative Cambodia] party were allied with the radical Khmer 
Rouge fighting against the Vietnamese-backed Phnom Penh regime 
throughout the 13-year civil war brought to a formal end with 
the signing of the 1991 Paris peace accords. The peace accords 
paved the way for the UN-supervised elections last May which led 
to the formation of the current coalition government consisting 
of the Phnom Penh party, the royalists and the BLDP. But the 
Khmer Rouge boycotted the polls and continued their guerrilla 
struggle against the government. 
  Son Sann said the victims of the current fighting were first 
of all Cambodian soldiers from both sides. 
  "But it is the people who suffer the most," he said. "The 
inhabitants of combat zones are killed and wounded. The 
survivors have to flee their destroyed homes and abandon all 
their belongings. Many try in vain to seek refuge abroad." 
  Son Sann called on all belligerent forces to declare a 
ceasefire in order "to end or diminish the suffering of the 
Cambodian people." 
  He also called for talks to start as soon as possible to 
implement a peace proposal put forward by King Norodom Sihanouk. 
The king suggested that "acceptable" members of the Khmer Rouge 
be given senior government posts in return for the radical 
faction opening up its zones, ceasing all guerrilla activities 
and merging its fighters with the government's royal armed 
forces. 
  Khmer Rouge nominal leader Khieu Samphan recently said he 
supported the king's proposal but co-premiers Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh and Hun Sen accused him of being "insincere" and 
demanded that the Khmer Rouge obey a ceasefire first and then 
hold the peace talks. 
  Government forces captured the Khmer Rouge's major 
headquarters and logistics base at Anlung Veng, near the Thai 
border in Siem Reap province on February 5, government officials 
said, adding that one of the main objectives of the attack was 
to push the guerrillas towards accepting a ceasefire. 
  Troops were also moving on Khmer Rouge positions to the east 
of Anlung Veng, in remote northern Preah Vihear province, 
co-premier Prince Ranariddh said Monday. 
  Some 2,000 villagers recently fled their homes in the Choam 
Khsan district of Preah Vihear to escape heavy guerrilla rocket 
and artillery attacks on government positions 
  Prince Ranariddh and Hun Sen have also threatened to attack 
the Khmer Rouge's main headquarters at Pailin in Battambang 
province if the guerrillas did not agree to the ceasefire prior 
to negotiations. 
  A western diplomat, however, said the government seemed to 
be 
losing patience with the guerrillas and to be shifting from a 
policy of fighting and talking, to just fighting.

<F P=106> [Unattributed "Article": "The First Step Toward National </F>
Unification"] 
  [Text] The recent capture of the Anlung Veng base by the 
Khmer Royal Armed Forces of the Kingdom of Cambodia was a great 
victory for the entire nation. This victory means the beginning 
of efforts to flush out the radical Khmer Rouge from the seceded 
area in one part of the country which the Khmer Rouge have 
claimed as their stronghold. While the Khmer Rouge have not 
been able to defend their high command, this is a good sign in 
the future for the royal government because the latter has 
decided not to fight on the negotiating table anymore but 
instead do the fighting on the battlefield. 
  This issue is clear when the Khmer Rouge started to make 
(?insistent) and unreasonable demands which the royal government 
cannot accept in its role as leader of the nation and of the 
country. In its role as the leader, the current government 
cannot bow to the stubborn outcast group. The royal government 
has to carry out its duty to safeguard the nation and the 
country's interest. 
  It is about time to start using strong measures. This time 
around the royal government has performed well right from the 
beginning. This is praiseworthy. The royal government has not 
only captured and controlled Anlung Veng but has also made plans 
to seize other areas controlled by the Khmer Rouge. The capture 
of Anlung Veng is serious pressure on the Khmer Rouge who have 
been affirming that they have sufficient forces and weapons to 
defend their strongholds in the country. This is also proof 
confirming the royal government's capability to run the country. 
  With efforts of the army to unite the nation, the situation 
is developing well and clearly for the future. The vigorous and 
energetic step and the preparations made with high technical 
standards could be the turning point for the resumption of talks 
between the Khmer Rouge and the royal government. Anlung Veng 
no longer has any leverage in talks to force the Khmer Rouge to 
comply with the royal government's conditions. 
  Because of this occasion, long-awaited by everyone, one 
should be glad with all national leaders who have adopted such 
active and firm actions.

  [Text] Reports from Chhuk District [Kampot Province], say 
that on 29 January leaders of the Vietnamese communist puppets 
and the two-headed government gathered a regiment of troops from 
Chhuk District, Kampot Province, to attack the people and the 
National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] along Route 3 in 
Chhuk District. However, as soon as as they showed up, they 
were ambushed and routed by the people and the NADK. The NADK 
and the people killed 11 enemy soldiers, including a platoon 
officer who died on the spot, and wounded 13 others. We seized 
six AK rifles and a quantity of war materiel. 
  The reports also say that the NADK and the people in Chhuk 
District, Kampot Province, remain constantly vigilant to smash 
and rout the offensive campaign of the Vietnamese communist 
puppets and the two-headed government. Furthermore, they say 
that offensive campaign of the Vietnamese communist puppets and 
the two-headed government against the people and the NADK is an 
act killing the nation and people. It is also an act pushing 
the Cambodian nation, people, and territory into the communist 
Vietnamese's Indochinese federation strategy. 
  The people cannot accept this. Our people want Cambodia to 
have independence, peace, and sovereignty with territorial 
integrity. They want national reconciliation in accordance with 
the five-point policy of Samdech Euv [Sihanouk] the king. 
  The reports further say that the NADK and the people have 
warned that by continuing to fuel Vietnam's war of aggression, 
leaders of the Vietnamese communist puppets and the two-headed 
government are war criminals. As a retribution, these war 
criminals will certainly be dissolved and disappear like 
previous traitors because of the people's curse.

<F P=106> [Article: "Effectively Broaden Economic Cooperation and </F>
Relations With Foreign Countries"] 
  [Text] After we began implementing the policy of broadening 
economic cooperation and relations with other countries as well 
as international organizations having good intentions toward our 
country -- regardless of the differences in political and social 
systems, by late 1993 it was reported that foreign and Lao 
business ventures had invested in 421 projects in our country 
with a total capital of U.S. $585 million. Of the said amount of 
investment, more than U.S. $91 million has come from domestic 
financial sources. The said investment was reported to be 
carried out in three sectors, namely, agriculture, industry, and 
services. Of the three sectors, 187 projects with a capital of 
U.S. $265 million are in the service sector; 159 projects with a 
capital of U.S. $217 million are in the industry sector; and 75 
projects with a capital of more than U.S. $103 million are in 
the agriculture sector. Compared with the previous years, the 
amount of investment capital in the aforementioned fields has 
increased markedly. 
  We can see that all this reflects an important achievement 
our party and government have made in implementing the policy of 
broadening economic cooperation and relations with foreign 
countries. It appears that the implementation of this policy has 
been effectively carried out with some modifications, thus 
attracting more and more foreign business interests to invest in 
Laos. Under the terms of this policy, the equitable sharing of 
legitimate benefits will be fully ensured for all the parties 
concerned. Most of these investment projects are in the fields 
of agriculture and forestry, electricity production, and 
infrastructure for export-oriented goods production. In addition 
to affirming the merit of our policy of broadening economic 
cooperation and relations with foreign countries, the 
achievement of attracting more foreign investment to our country 
also serves to enhance the role and prestige of our party and 
government in the international arena. 
  Nonetheless, it can be said that most of the foreign 
investment in our country is mainly concentrated in the service 
sector. With regard to this trend, many commentators, especially 
our economic experts, have cautioned that our efforts to attract 
foreign investment to transform the natural and semi-natural 
economy into a goods production economy in our country starting 
from agricultural and forestry development may be misdirected. 
Superficially speaking, this assumption has a certain degree of 
rationality in it. However, we must learn more lessons on this 
from the neighboring countries. 
  In the meantime, we cannot afford to be too theoretically 
rigid in our economic principles. Everyone must agree that the 
building of our country along the correct policy of the party 
and government requires a large amount of investment. Therefore, 
given the present economic, social, and cultural circumstances 
and the status of our country, it is appropriate that we try to 
attract foreign investors to bring capital into our country for 
investment here. At the same time, we must always keep in mind 
that proper facilities must be available to serve the service 
business operations in our country, such as trading and tourism. 
A network of needed infrastructure, such as roads, 
telecommunications facilities, means of transport, hotel 
accommodation, services, and financial outlets must be set up. 
Many economic experts and public figures frequently point out 
that a number of investment projects in Laos proposed by foreign 
businessmen have been delayed. This is because the requests to 
implement some investment projects here are often submitted to 
our authorities by brokers, who subsequently sell the permits 
granted to them to foreign investors for profit. Such practices 
naturally result in delays in the implementation of the projects 
concerned, thus causing losses to both our country and the 
foreign investors, and discouraging prospective foreign 
enterprises from making investment here. In addition, the 
implementation of some investment projects has not been carried 
out in earnest, thereby causing numerous difficulties to our 
management sector. On average, most [foreign investment] 
projects, be they small, medium, or large, have been smoothly 
and effectively executed on the basis of mutual trust, equality, 
friendship, and mutual benefits. 
  At the moment, preparations are being made for the launching 
of a number of major investment projects, such as the 
construction of hydroelectric, cement, and other plants. Relying 
on past experience, our authorities and cadres concerned are 
energetically and comprehensively carrying out the necessary 
work to ensure that all management loopholes are completely 
plugged so that no losses will ensue to the investors and our 
country. 
  To continue broadening our economic cooperation and 
relations 
with foreign countries effectively, we must first pay special 
attention to our management work to ensure that the party's and 
government's policy on promoting foreign investment in various 
forms of lasting cooperation for mutual benefits is effectively 
implemented, especially in the fields of agriculture and 
forestry, hydropower production, and infrastructure construction 
for export- oriented goods production, thereby creating more 
financial resources for our national development. 
  To effectively achieve this goal, we must adopt more 
essential regulations to be included in the law on foreign 
investment and implement necessary policies with a view to 
creating favorable conditions for foreign investors. In 
addition, we must issue more documents with accurate investment 
data for use by foreign business enterprises. Our service 
management style must also be improved in order to promote 
competent businessmen and eliminate brokers. We must rigorously 
encourage all the services concerned to provide needed 
conditions to foreign investors.

  [Text] President Ramos disclosed yesterday that Malaysian 
Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamed had expressed his desire for 
the final settlement of the Sabah claim during his state visit 
last week. He said that while the Sabah issue was not in the 
agenda of Mahathir's visit, he (Ramos) brought up the subject 
during their one-on-one meeting at Malacanang last Thursday. 
  Mr. Ramos said he informed the Malaysian premier that the 
government put up a foundation to help the heirs and descendants 
of the Sultan of Sulu in terms of investment and livelihood 
opportunities instead of depending on the small rental paid 
annually by the Malaysian government. He said Mahathir conveyed 
his wish to assist the heirs of the Sulu sultan, "if my help is 
needed please let me know," Ramos quoted the Malaysian head of 
government as saying. 
  The late Sultan Ismail Kiram of Sulu ceded to the Philippine 
government sovereignty rights over Sabah in 1963 in order to 
recover the territory which become part of Malaysia. But the 
proprietary rights remain with the Sulu sultanate. Based on the 
decision of a Malaysian court in 1939, the heirs were entitled 
to an annual rental payment of 5,000 Malaysian ringgits (about 
P50,000.00 [Philippine pesos]). 
  Mr. Ramos debunked the claims of some of the heirs that the 
government has been neglecting its commitment to help in 
resolving their propriety or compensation claims. He said the 
issue is being addressed by the executive-legislative council on 
Sabah claim and the Sabah desk of the Department of Foreign 
Affairs (DFA). 
  The president said the certain problems were created by the 
destruction of valuable documents on the Sabah claim when the 
old DFA building along Padre Faura street, Manila was burned a 
few years ago. He said a group of scholars have been trying to 
reconstruct these documents. 
  Mr. Ramos said part of the comprehensive solution of the 
Sabah Issue is his proposal for the creation of an East ASEAN 
growth area (EAGA) composed of Mindanao, East Malaysia, Eastern 
Indonesia and Brunei Darussalam.

  [Text] Malacanang [presidential office] said it would 
abide by the agreements reached in the recent Uruguay Round to 
tear down barriers, particularly on agricultural products, 
although it would pursue parallel actions to prevent any 
dislocations in the country's agricultural sector. 
  Agriculture Secretary Roberto Sebastian said the government 
will gradually reduce trade barriers on agricultural products in 
the wake of the successful conclusion of the General Agreements 
on Tariff and Trade (GATT). But the tempo of this policy will 
have to conform with the existing laws such as the Magna Carta 
for Small Farmers which requires some form of protection for the 
country's agricultural sector, he added. 
  Sebastian said the government can only liberalize its market 
once the country is already prepared to competitively take on 
the global market. Sebastian explained that the government's 
protection on smaller farmers does not reverse the government's 
commitment to free trade and fairer playing field in the world 
economy. He said these moves are part of government's measures 
to prepare local farmers for global competition. 
  To prove his point, Sebastian said Malacanang is willing to 
certify as urgent a package of legislative measures to help 
local farmers compete in the world market. He said the 
government is also putting in place the infrastructures needed 
to become globally-competitive -- irrigation, post-harvest 
facilities and farm-to-market roads -- while trying to reduce 
protection measures gradually. 
  To demonstrate how the protection measures are gradually 
reduced, the agriculture department cited the lifting of 
quantitative restrictions on processed meat products which was 
earlier listed on Memorandum Order 95 which reimposes 
quantitative restrictions (QRS) on a number of products, like 
corn, corn substitutes, livestock, meat and meat products and 
other agricultural produce.

  [Text] Australia's unemployment rate has fallen to its 
lowest level in 20 months coming in at 10.6 percent last month. 
Officially just over 929,000 Australians are out of work, down 
by a little over 8,000 for the month. Linda Mottram reports the 
new figures also show another 22,000 Australians found work in 
January. 
  [Begin Mottram recording] The January figures from the 
Australian Bureau of Statistics defied a columnist's prediction 
that there could be a slight rise in the jobless rate. Instead, 
there was a fall of 0.1 percent from December to 10.6 percent in 
January. It is the third successive monthly fall in the 
unemployment rate. Most significantly, the numbers of men 
seeking full-time jobs fell by almost 12,500 but a longer term 
measure of the trend in the unemployment rate continues to be 
flat at 10.8 percent. The figures also show a slight rise in 
the participation rate, that is the combined number of people 
with jobs and officially registered as looking for work, 
indicating renewed confidence among job seekers about their 
prospects in the work force. The figures also give the new year 
school leavers their search measure of the state of the job 
market. [end recording]

  [Text] PORT MORESBY, Feb 10 (AFP) -- A prominent Papua New 
Guinea leader Thursday spoke out strongly here against any 
Australian political involvement in the secession-torn province 
of Bougainville. Bernard Narokobi, an influential opposition 
MP, gave an emphatic "no" when responding to an agreement 
between prime ministers Paias Wingti of PNG and Paul Keating of 
Australia that an Australian parliamentary delegation could 
visit Bougainville. 
  The island province has been riven by conflict since a 
secessionist uprising there four years ago and each side has 
accused the other of atrocities. A delegation would assess 
security and investigate allegations of human rights abuses. The 
timing and composition of the group is to be discussed between 
the two governments. 
  Narokobi, a former attorney general, was one of two 
government negotiators of two failed peace accords -- the 
Endeavour Accord and the Honiara Declaration -- made with 
Bougainville rebels. Narokobi accused Wingti, currently 
visiting Australia, of admitting failure by agreeing to allow 
outsiders to attend to PNG's domestic problems. He told 
journalists that Australia would be meddling in PNG's internal 
affairs if it sent the delegation. 
  "Australian parliamentarians have no right whatsoever to 
walk 
into Bougainville," he said. 
  Narokobi said he would personally refuse to co-operate with 
them, and has called on security forces in Bougainville not to 
allow the delegation on to the island. He said for any outsider 
to come in would be the "highest form of insult." 
  "Australians would do well to attend to the plight of their 
indigenous people," he said. And if an Australian parliamentary 
delegation was allowed into PNG, then a similar PNG delegation 
should be allowed to go to Australia to look into issues 
affecting indigenous Australians, he added.

  [Text] There have been two new clashes between Papua New 
Guinea [PNG] security forces and the Bougainville Revolutionary 
Army [BRA] in which one person was reported to have been killed 
and three wounded. PNG Radio said the first clash occurred when 
the BRA attacked the government station at Boku in Southeast 
Bougainville yesterday morning. The radio said one of the 
rebels was killed in an exchange of fire with troops guarding 
the station. In the second clash, three civilians, including a 
senior public servant, were wounded when rebels ambushed two 
government vehicles travelling from Sovele to (?Koto). One of 
the vehicles was abandoned and later set on fire by the rebels. 
PNG Radio said the clashes are part of step-up attacks by the 
BRA in government- controlled areas of Bougainville.

  [Text] Yukio Itagaki, chairman of the Japan Auto Parts 
Manufacturers' Association (and president of Zexel Corporation), 
gave a speech at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan in 
Tokyo on 8 February. Speaking about the U.S. demands at the 
Japan-U.S. Government talks on setting numerical targets with 
respect to procurement of auto parts, Itagaki noted, "business 
volume is bound to change depending on economic conditions." He 
cast doubts on the rationale for the U.S. Government's rigid 
position, saying "the government should not interfere in purely 
private business dealings." 
  He also said "not-externally-forced, voluntary cooperative 
relations should be established between Japan and the United 
States."

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Takayuki Hikuchi] </F>
  [Text] During a series of meetings with Japanese cabinet 
ministers, U.S. Trade Representative Kantor, who visited Japan 
last week, said: "Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata will assume the 
overall responsibility for the Japan-U.S. economic framework 
talks." His statement has raised controversy within the 
government. The Foreign Ministry has asked the U.S. Government 
to correct Mr. Kantor's statement, claiming, "The foreign 
minister never made a statement to that effect." The U.S. 
Government, which is pinning high hopes on the Japan-U.S. 
foreign ministerial talks to he held shortly before the 
Japan-U.S. summit talks slated for 11 February, has yet to 
answer the request. 
  The interpretation of Mr. Kantor's statement is that Foreign 
Minister Hata has assumed the position of Japan's top negotiator 
responsible for the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. A 
source familiar with the talks, who attended two rounds of 
meetings between Mr. Kantor and Foreign Minister Hata, said the 
foreign minister made no remark to that effect. 
  On 7 February, Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito shook 
his 
head, saying, "Since (Mr. Hata) is foreign minister and deputy 
prime minister, Mr.Kantor probably thought Mr. Hata would assume 
overall responsibility for the talks." He also flatly denied 
Mr. Kantor's statement, saying, "It is not proper for Mr. Hata 
to assume the overall responsibility for the talks." It has 
been agreed that vice ministerial officials from the two 
countries would hold the talks. Agreements reached by both sides 
will be compiled in a report for presentation at the Japan-U.S. 
summit talks, but no ministerial talks are scheduled. At first, 
the Japanese Government was annoyed by Mr. Kantor's visit to 
Japan, but it treated him as a special envoy to the U.S. 
President. 
  It is unclear why Mr. Kantor made the statement, but he is 
believed to have made the statement with the aim of bringing a 
hasty political settlement to the talks by drawing Prime 
Minister Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Hata out to ministerial 
talks if vice ministerial negotiations fail to hammer out any 
agreements. 
  At first, the Foreign Ministry tried to ignore Mr. Kantor's 
statement as "publicity for back home." But it later decided to 
ask the U.S. Government for a correction, fearing that 
controversy might spread within the government. 
  The United States has pressed Japan for concessions in the 
automobile negotiations, which have continued to face rough 
sailing. Vice Foreign Minister Saito stressed that the 
automobile issue is out of our ministry's jurisdiction, saying, 
"How to deal with the automobile issue is primarily up to the 
international trade and industry minister." It seems that the 
real intention of the Japanese side is that: "It does not want 
to break a good relationship among the Foreign Ministry, the 
Finance Ministry, and the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry." Did Mr. Kantor's feint operation not work in the 
face of the bureaucratic barrier of the three ministries that 
remain more cohesive than at any time in the past?

<F P=106> [Unattributed report] </F>
  [Text] A government official disclosed on 9 February that a 
U.S. official in charge of the Japanese-U.S. framework trade 
talks has proposed a plan to submit at the 11 February 
Japanese-U.S. summit meeting an "interim report on 
consultations" which includes a side-by-side listing of points 
of dispute between Japan and the United States as they currently 
stand. The United States has apparently taken this step after 
judging that it has become difficult to reach an agreement with 
Japan in such individual trade sectors as automobiles and auto 
parts, over which negotiations have been stalled. Because the 
United States has termed this report as being "interim" in 
nature, there is a strong possibility that the trade talks will 
virtually be extended. Therefore, prospects are that 
negotiations now will turn to dealing with the case of the two 
nations failing to reach an agreement. 
  The interim report plan has been proposed by W. Bowman 
Cutter, deputy assistant to the president for economic policy 
and who is the U.S. official in charge of deputy-level 
negotiations. The report is said to list, side by side, 
Japanese and U.S. assertions over such issues as "numerical 
targets." The agreement reached by Japan and the United States 
last July concerning the new framework trade talks stipulates 
that an assessment be made of the progress in the trade talks at 
a deputy-level meeting prior to the summit meeting and that a 
report subsequently be submitted to the leaders of the two 
nations. 
  A Japanese Government official asserts that "because the 
United States has further pressed for setting numerical targets 
even in the area of government procurement, where negotiations 
have made relative progress, the trade talks as a whole have 
regressed instead." 
  In this connection, a senior official of the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI] said on the evening of 9 
February: "No work has been done to narrow the gap between 
Japan and the United States at the resumed negotiations in 
Washington between Koichiro Matsuura, deputy vice minister of 
foreign affairs, and W. Bowman Cutter, deputy assistant to the 
president for economic policy. They are already talking about 
what to do now." 
  On the same evening, MITI Minister Hiroshi Kumagai said, 
"There is a wide gap (between Japanese and U.S. assertions)." 
He expressed the hope that a negative impact on bilateral 
relations can be kept to a minimum even in the case of an 
agreement not being reached.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Shigeru Komogo] </F>
  [Text] Washington, 9 Feb -- The Clinton administration has 
taken a tough stand on trade toward Japan by notifying the 
Japanese Government that it will break off working-level 
negotiations under the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks. 
Because of disappointment over Japan's new package of stimulus 
measures, which fell short of fulfilling the United States' high 
hopes, the Clinton administration appears to have decided to 
break off the working-level negotiations between bureaucrats of 
the two countries and to look for political decisions from Prime 
Minister Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Hata. The Clinton 
administration has decided to do so because of the U.S. 
Administration's long-held view that "if pressure is applied on 
Japan, Japan yields to the United States' trade demands." This 
is unfortunate for Japan. The Clinton administration has 
decided to break off the working-level negotiations in defiance 
of domestic criticism against it for being impatient for trade 
results from the framework talks. Its decision can be termed a 
dangerous gambit. 
  The administration's decision to break off the working-level 
negotiations has been anticipated. In the working-level 
negotiations on government procurement of telecommunications 
equipment and medical instruments held on the morning of 8 
February, before the Clinton administration notified the 
Japanese Government [of the working-level talks' suspension], 
the U.S. Trade Representative made an unprecedented demand that 
"Japan increase its government procurement of foreign-made 
telecommunications equipment and medical instruments by 25 
percent every year" with the aim of having Japan reject this 
demand. The Japanese delegation clearly viewed this demand as a 
"U.S. proposal aimed at bringing an end to the working-level 
negotiations." 
  A member of the U.S. delegation said that "Japan's new 
package of stimulus measures" has prompted the Clinton 
administration to break off the working-level negotiations. The 
Japanese Government originally was supposed to decide to cut the 
income tax for three years, but now it has decided to cut it for 
only one year. In response, the Clinton administration has 
expressed its dissatisfaction. 
  In cabinet-level negotiations, the U.S. side will try to 
wring a commitment from the Japanese side under which Japan will 
go along with the United States on numerical targets and will 
cut its income tax for many more years. The Clinton 
administration thinks that toward this end, it is wise to opt 
for negotiations with Japan's foreign minister, who is 
considered to be "close to the prime minister and able to make 
decisions."

<F P=106> [Article by Kenji Takeuchi, Tokyo Economic News Department </F>
reporter: "Bureaucrats Take Tough Attitude Toward U.S."] 
  [Text] The Japanese Government's negotiating stand in the 
Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks has been notably tough. 
In the talks, the U.S. side has stuck to its demand for setting 
"numerical targets" designed to gain access to the Japanese 
market. This approach has come under attack in the United 
States. Being inspired by the attack in the United States, the 
Japanese side therefore has gotten tough increasingly at the 
talks. The thinking of bureaucrats in the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI], the Foreign Ministry, 
and the Finance Ministry at the talks has changed greatly. Will 
the transformation of Kasumigaseki [government district in 
Tokyo], which has begun to speak out with a "no" [to U.S. trade 
demands], result in the construction of an "equal Japanese-U.S. 
partnership," which has never gotten off the ground, or result 
in the further deepening of the United States' distrust in 
Japan? Japanese-U.S. relations now stand at a crossroads. 
  An official at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo disclosed that 
apprehension spread within the U.S. Government late last year 
when Masahisa Naito, director general of MITI's Industrial 
Policy Bureau, resigned. At the time, a U.S. Government 
official asked, "Is MITI really going to sack a pro-American 
official?" Mr. Naito was in fact dismissed, and he was one of 
the Japanese Government officials who knew the United States 
well and who had broad personal ties with U.S. Government 
officials. 
<H5>  Dependence on Personal Ties Becomes Less Important </H5>
  Mr. Naito resigned because of Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party], which aimed to subordinate the bureaucracy to 
politicians, and because of a factional struggle within MITI. 
Some officials in MITI said in unison, "The U.S. Government's 
apprehensions missed the point." The dependence on personal 
ties in the conduct of diplomacy with the United States has 
certainly become less important. 
  The chief of the Americas Division of MITI's International 
Trade Policy Bureau is a working-level official in charge of 
trade negotiations with the United States. Many of the 
successive division chiefs have served in the New York office of 
the Japan External Trade Organization (Jetro), which is called 
"MITI's hidden channel to the United States." 
  Mr. Masakazu Toyoda, who became the chief of the Americas 
Division last July, has not served in the United States. He is 
the first division chief who has written an article in the 
"Report on Unfair Trade" compiled by the Industry Structure 
Council that was critical of the United States' protectionist 
trade policy. A senior MITI official says that Toyoda was 
appointed division chief under "MITI's personnel management 
policy of giving important posts to officials who are able to 
analyze the United States in a unbiased way." 
  In the Finance Ministry, which has maintained its own 
negotiating channel with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, 
Deputy Finance Minister Matoko Uchinai, a typical pro-American 
official, resigned in 1991. The channel is now close to 
breaking. 
<H5>  The Emergence of Officials With a Diversified Awareness </H5>
  The Finance Ministry asked the Foreign Ministry to arrange a 
meeting between Prime Minister Hosokawa and U.S. Treasury 
Secretary Bentsen when the latter visited Japan in late January. 
This became a topic among government officials. The "practice" 
under which "the Finance Ministry is exclusively in charge of 
arranging all itineraries in Japan for high-ranking officials 
from the U.S. Treasury Department, and that the Foreign Ministry 
cannot touch these itineraries, has broken down." 
  While the diplomacy-through-personal-ties is receding, an 
assertion of "multilateralism" is emerging in Kasumigaseki. 
This multilateralism has emerged from the "multilateral trade 
system," a doctrine of GATT. Some government officials are 
asserting that Japan's trade policy, which has so far focused on 
trade relations with the United States, should transform itself 
into one that conforms to GATT rules and focuses on trade 
relations with other nations. 
  In taking advantage of the Uruguay Round (the multilateral 
trade negotiations), each ministry has staffed its bureau in 
charge of GATT affairs with capable officials. GATT is set to 
be transformed into the World Trade Organization (WTO), which 
will have a powerful say on world trade matters. Yoshihiro 
Sakamoto, director general of MITI's Trade Policy Bureau, says, 
"We want to foster an awareness among our officials that they 
need to hold trade talks with U.S. negotiators with a 
multilateral perspective." 
  The officials with a multilateral perspective are already 
claiming: "If the United States slaps sanctions on Japan, Japan 
will take its case to GATT. If Japan compromises with the 
United States on numerical targets, this would lead to a loss of 
Japan's credibility in Asia and Europe." What should not be 
overlooked is their experience with the Uruguay Round. 
<H5>  The United States Is More Pusillanimous Than Thought </H5>
  A junior MITI official who saw the United States make large 
concessions in 11th-hour negotiations with the European Union 
(EU) says, "I think that although the United States talks tough, 
it is more pusillanimous than I had thought." 
  Multilateral negotiations are "open negotiations" in which 
negotiators exchange their assertions according to rules and are 
a power game in which the interests of nations clash. In 
previous Japanese-U.S. negotiations, attention has focused on 
how far Japan will go in making concessions to the United 
States. Now, however, a group of bureaucrats with a sense of 
the game, and who are eager to hold trade talks with U.S. 
negotiators on an equal basis, is emerging. 
<H5>  The Concessive Thinking Is Losing Weight </H5>
  Japanese Ambassador to Washington Takakazu Kuriyama, who 
recently returned to Japan, told Prime Minister Hosokawa, 
"Although the United States has a good impression of the 
Hosokawa government, it is tough in trade negotiations." In 
response, a senior Foreign Ministry official said coolly, 
"Almost no Foreign Ministry officials believe that Japan must 
concede as much as possible to the United States to keep its 
relations with that country in place." 
  According to the same senior Foreign Ministry official, the 
keywords of Japan's diplomacy toward the United States are 
"broad and in the medium-term." The idea is that "Japan aims to 
build a friendly medium-term relationship between Japan and the 
United States while pointing out to the U.S. Government, which 
is focusing on economic issues, the importance of maintaining 
security and politically cooperative relations between the two 
countries." This concept implicitly indicates that Japan does 
not care about the occurrence of temporary discord in its 
relations with the United States. In fact, no tensions are 
evident in government offices despite rough sailing in the 
Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks. 
  With the collapse of the cold war structure, the importance 
of security issues in Japanese-U.S. relations has decreased. 
Another senior Foreign Ministry official said, "The Foreign 
Ministry is no longer in an obsessive mood to recheck Japan's 
relations with the United States whenever Japanese-U.S. summit 
talks are held." 
  There is another reason why Japanese bureaucrats feel 
relaxed: the decrease in the competitiveness of Japan's economy. 
The Japanese-U.S. semiconductor agreement, which the U.S. 
Government intends to use as a model for "numerical targets," 
was concluded in 1986; plans for the expansion of Japan's 
purchase of U.S.-made auto parts were announced in early 1992. 
At the time of concluding the semiconductor agreement, Japanese 
chip makers were in a dominant position, and some Japanese chip 
makers even said, "Our cornering the U.S. chip market is just a 
matter of time." At that time, the share of Japanese-built cars 
in the U.S. market was on the increase. 
  Now the situation has been reversed. U.S. chip and 
automobile makers have outstripped their Japanese counterparts 
after catching up with them. Japan's current-accounts surplus 
posted a record high in 1993. It is apparent that the surplus 
is on the decline after peaking that year. 
  A senior MITI official involved in semiconductor 
negotiations 
with the United States said: "We felt guilty in our minds that 
Japan was disrupting the economies of the United States and the 
world. Now, we have no such guilty conscience." A cynical 
structure has been built wherein the "weakness of one's economy" 
leads to strength in negotiations. 
<H5>  Danger Leading to a Change in Attitude </H5>
  Perhaps the new thinking of bureaucrats is a first step 
toward transforming the psychologically warped Japanese-U.S. 
relations into "ordinary bilateral relations." In their being 
transformed, however, there is a danger that this could lead to 
a "change in the attitude of each toward the other." At a 
recent seminar, junior MITI officials snarled at a U.S. official 
well versed in Japan-U.S. negotiations: "The Japanese market is 
open, and there is no problem with the market. The United 
States is heading toward managed trade." The U.S. official 
responded to their criticism, saying: "We believe that Japanese 
businessmen and scholars do not disagree at all on the point 
that the Japanese economy is managed to a substantial extent. 
If Japanese bureaucrats are only criticizing the United States 
for pursuing `managed trade' instead of themselves addressing 
Japan's problems, the United States will point out their 
hypocrisy."

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 10 Feb 94 Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] In a news conference before his departure for the 
United States on 9 February, Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister 
cum foreign minister, commented on reports that U.S. Treasury 
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen criticized Japan's comprehensive 
economic stimulus package as "a small step." Hata reacted 
strongly, saying: "The United States may be thinking it is 
something like a tax rebate. The package worth a total of 15.25 
billion yen is the largest in scale in history. The United 
States does not yet understand what it is about." 
  Asked about the view that the United States might incite a 
further increase of the yen value on the exchange market should 
the Japan-U.S. framework talks end in failure, Hata said: "The 
exchange market is something that reflects the fundamentals 
[preceding word published in English] of that nation. An 
incitement by words only does not have a long-lasting effect." 
He then complained harshly: "An official in an influential 
position should be very careful about what he says." 
  Speaking about his talks with top U.S. leaders preceding the 
Japan-U.S. summit meeting, he reiterated the position of not 
accepting U.S. demands in the economic framework talks regarding 
numerical targets. He said: "Japan is making steady progress 
toward removal of its surplus. If I speak frankly, they will 
probably come to understand it." But he added: "I would like to 
hold a dialogue, based on the principle that numerical targets 
cannot be accepted."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Do Not Bank on Recovery of U.S. Economy"] </F>
  [Text] The Japan-U.S. summit talks are scheduled to open 
in Washington this weekend. As usual, the biggest topic is how 
to reduce Japan's trade surplus, which recently reached a record 
high of $140 billion. 
  However, while Japan-U.S. economic frictions have been 
discussed under a hypothesis that "The Japanese economy is 
stronger than that of the United States," the framework has 
completely changed since the Clinton administration's 
inauguration. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will certainly be surprised 
if he actually sees a sudden recovery of the U.S. economy, since 
Japan has not yet found a way out of the prolonged recession. 
  An economic expansion of the United States economy is good 
news for the Japanese economy. Generally speaking, the yen 
becomes cheaper against the dollar when the U.S. economy becomes 
strong. Expanded output by U.S. industries brings about 
increased machine and part exports from Japan to the United 
States. Since the exporting industries of Japan have been 
suffering from the rapid appreciation of the yen rates, they may 
be given a break. 
  Of course, the U.S. economy has not yet become strong enough 
to allow Japan's economic recovery through boosted exports to 
the United States. On the other hand, Japanese industries' 
competitive power is currently too weak to resume violent 
exports to the United States. 
  Japan must accelerate its efforts to revitalize its economy 
by stimulating domestic consumption. At the same time, it is 
about time Japan dealt with the United States as an equal 
partner, overcoming its passive manners in bilateral 
negotiations. 
  In the last quarter of 1993, the real growth rate of the 
U.S. 
economy reached 5.9 percent. This demonstrated the United 
States is really heading for economic recovery. After the 
enactment of legislation for reducing fiscal deficits, private 
consumption and capital investments were triggered by a rapid 
decline in long-term market interest rates. 
  According to U.S. President Bill Clinton's budget message to 
the Congress, the federal government's fiscal deficits in fiscal 
year 1995 (from October 1994 to September 1995) will drop to 
$170 billion. If the figure remains below $200 billion, it will 
be the lowest in the last six years. 
  The reduction of fiscal deficits is a result of the budget 
cut and tax hike policies. Lowered interest rates and economic 
recovery are also positive factors in the sense that these bring 
about a reduction of interest payments on national bonds and an 
increase in tax revenues. 
  Yet, we cannot be too optimistic about the future of the 
U.S. 
economy. The government's belt-tightening policy is a negative 
factor for further economic expansion. If the Congress rejects 
the government's medical insurance reform plan, long-term 
interest rates will rapidly pick up in anticipation of fiscal 
deficit growth. 
  It is also uncertain how long personal consumption will 
remain brisk in the United States because individual consumption 
is already growing faster than people's income. Increased job 
opportunities are primarily for temporary employees of 
restaurants and other service industries, rather than permanent 
employees in manufacturing industries. The expansion of 
individual consumption will be limited when the economic 
recovery does not raise workers' earnings. 
  It is not very easy to maintain high levels of economic 
growth through the domestic market's expansion when the nation 
is working on reducing fiscal deficits. So, the Clinton 
administration has an economic strategy to expand exports to 
boost the economy. This is why the United States is strongly 
urging Japan to open its markets and expand domestic consumption. 
  Prime Minister Hosokawa is going to attend the summit with 
the new pump-priming package as a souvenir. At that time, the 
prime minister should not let the United States entertain too 
many expectations about effects from the pump-priming package 
because it cannot boost the Japanese economy or reduce Japan's 
trade surplus immediately. 
  The prime minister should candidly explain the fact that the 
government has very limited control over the economy. The 
private sector's self-help effort is an indispensable condition 
for overcoming the recession. Also, U.S. exports to Japan 
cannot be increased without efforts by U.S. companies. If Japan 
accepts U.S. demands for setting numerical targets for 
increasing imports from the United States, it will only result 
in a reinforcement of governmental restrictions over business 
activities. 
  The foundation for international policy coordination is 
sincerely seeking steady growth of one's own economy, not 
criticizing each other. We hope the two leaders reconfirm this 
point at the summit.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Leaders of Japan and the United States are </F>
urged to hold High-Dimensional Talks"] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will depart for 
Washington on the evening of 10 February to meet with President 
Bill Clinton in a Japan-U.S. summit -- without knowing when the 
Japan- U.S. economic framework talks will come to a conclusion. 
The meeting at the White House on the morning of 11 February, 
local time, will be the prime minister's third summit with the 
President, after one in New York and another in Seattle last 
year. What will come out of it being so difficult to predict, 
the Foreign Ministry officials who are involved in preparing for 
it said, "We have no idea what will happen there." 
  The two governments in the framework talks are supposed to 
make reports on progress of negotiations every half year with 
respect to "macroeconomics," "structural and sector-by-sector 
talks," and "global scale cooperation." As far as 
"macroeconomics" is concerned, the prime minister will be 
hand-carrying a gift -- the nation's largest economic stimulus 
package including tax reductions for 6 trillion yen, but no 
headway is being made in the "sector-by- sector talks" dealing 
with the priority areas, such as the government procurement, 
insurance market, and automobiles and auto parts. 
  In particular, the dispute between the United States which 
demands setting specific numerical targets market shares and 
Japan which objects to it, saying such numerical targets would 
lead to managed trade is still there where it started. 
  The framework talks are now expected to drag on until the 
last moment before the summit meeting. On some of the things 
like the automobiles and auto parts, it is even possible that 
the top leaders will have to make a political decision 
themselves. 
  In the previous two meetings, the United States did not push 
difficult demands on Prime Minister Hosokawa. That was because 
the economic consultations were still under way, and the United 
States thought it would be to its benefit to back up the new 
administration which was supposed to be all for a "reform." The 
United States is beginning to have doubts about the basis of the 
Hosokawa coalition government and the leadership of the prime 
minister himself. 
  WASHINGTON POST reporter Howard Cohen [name as published] 
wrote recently: "The people close to President Clinton now feel 
they might have overestimated Prime Minister Hosokawa, or at 
least misjudged his ability to fulfill his pledge on market 
liberalization." 
  As if in comformity with such atmosphere in the United 
States, Foreign Minister Hata has been set to attend the meeting 
between the two top leaders. Recently when U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor came to Japan, he said "I would 
like to talk with a politician who has real power," and then met 
with Foreign Minister Hata. As seen in that instance, it 
appears certain that the United States is beginning to question 
where the real policymaking power resides in Japan. 
  There is no doubt that a show performance will be played out 
to plant an impression that the summit itself has been a 
"success." But the problem is whether deep-rooted distrust -- as 
observed in the words of the two countries' negotiating 
officials -- can be removed. 
  Just as the Clinton government has no comprehensive policy 
on 
Japan, the Hosokawa government has no policy on the United 
States. All that is happening is that the bureaucrats in the 
forefront of the negotiations are clashing with each other over 
their national interests and reputations. While people were 
unaware as their eyes were focused on domestic affairs, the 
situation in the Japan-U.S. relations has developed into a 
rather critical one. 
  It is unfortunate for the two countries to turn economic 
issues into political issues. We hope that the two top leaders 
-- now more than at any time -- will hold a meeting of high 
dimension [kojigen] with long-term future in their perspective.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article] </F>
  [Text] Amid the deadlock in the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks, the attitude adopted by Walter Mondale, U.S. 
ambassador to Japan for five months now, has become a popular 
topic of discussion among quarters concerned with Japan-U.S. 
relations. Unlike former Ambassador Michael Armacost, dubbed 
"Mr. Gaiatsu [Foreign Pressure]," while Mondale has done nothing 
astounding, "he applies pressure through legitimate channels, 
using his extensive personal connections (both in Japan and the 
United States)" (according to a Foreign Ministry source). Thus, 
he also proves to be a formidable foe. 
  Mondale, who served in the U.S. Senate for 12 years, was a 
vice president, and also a Democratic presidential candidate, 
took office in September 1993 as the second 
politician-ambassador after former Ambassador Mike Mansfield. 
Since then, he has held talks energetically with the heads and 
influential members of all political parties, except the Japan 
Communist Party, and executives of various economic 
organizations and U.S. companies in Japan. In late January, in 
a speech at a gathering organized by the Kansai Federation of 
Economic Organizations, he argued for the need to reach an 
agreement in the framework talks with the Japan-U.S. summit 
meeting close at hand on 11 February. He said, "We need to 
reach some sort of positive agreement quickly." 
  Many appreciate Mondale's style of doing things through 
regular channels. Mondale, who has strong connections with the 
core of the U.S. Administration, "is an ambassador who can call 
the White House directly, and exercise influence on the U.S. 
Government's policymaking" (according to a U.S. Embassy source). 
Japanese Government officials also admit that "unlike 
Ambassador Armacost, who relied on Mr. Ozawa (Ichiro Ozawa, 
current secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]), 
he does not provoke much ill will" (according to a Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry source). 
  Officials both in Japan and the United States highly 
appraise 
Mondale's abilities. They believe the recently concluded 
Japan-U.S. construction talks were the result of Mondale's 
meeting with the embassy's economic section twice a week to come 
up with ways to break the deadlock. 
  According to a U.S. Embassy source, with regard to the 
present economic framework talks, Mondale has been "advising" 
the U.S. Administration over the past three months that "instead 
of the rhetorical arguments about whether or not numerical 
targets will be accepted, the United States should negotiate on 
the more concrete issues of what it wants and what it would like 
Japan to do." 
  Mondale's remarks on the employment issue in relation to the 
import and export of computers during the 1984 presidential 
campaign made people think that he took a strongly anti-Japanese 
stance. However, "(his reputation as a) champion of Japan 
bashing is a thing of the past. He now behaves very moderately" 
(according to diplomatic sources in Japan and the United 
States). Mondale is also said to have favorable feelings toward 
the Hosokawa administration, which upholds "reform" -- a cause 
he himself has advocated. 
  Nevertheless, he is an astute politician. Some Japanese 
government officials simply think that "he is merely being 
careful now because he knows what came out of Mr. Armacost's 
methods." 
  Mondale may leave for the United States temporarily on 8 
February to give a direct briefing on the Japanese situation to 
President Clinton. As the framework talks, which may have 
serious effects on Japan-U.S. relations, enter a critical stage, 
it is also an opportune time to see how this powerful ambassador 
will exercise his leadership.

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] has prepared a pamphlet in which various examples of 
successful business operations by foreign companies in Japan are 
introduced. This pamphlet, written in English and aimed at 
promoting the advance of foreign companies into the Japanese 
market, gives examples of successful operations by 20 foreign 
companies, including Bayerishe Motoren Werke AG. [BMW], 
Coca-Cola Japan Co., Ltd., Mobil Oil Corporation, and American 
Family Corporation. 
  The brochure, which is entitled: "An Invitation to the 
Japanese Market," describes various facts such as changes in 
each individual company's sales as well as the factors for their 
success. For example, regarding BMW's success, the pamphlet 
cites the following factors: 1) Improvement of the 
implementation of a sales strategy befitting the market 
situation; 2) introduction of products conforming to market 
characteristics such as right-hand drive models; and 3) 
establishment of a network of dealers specializing in its cars. 
In this way, MITI explains that strategies befitting the 
Japanese market have resulted in successful operations. 
  Many factors cited in the pamphlet as accounting for 
successful operations seem to be based on the argument 
maintained by Tokyo at the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. 
The pamphlet appears to have been designed to promote Japanese 
refutation of the United States' criticism that "due to the 
closed nature of the Japanese market, it is impossible for us to 
join in."

  [Text] Regarding the issue of the DPRK's (North Korea) 
suspected nuclear arms development, by 9 February, Japan, the 
United States, and South Korea had agreed on an understanding 
that if there is no change in North Korea's position of refusing 
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), 
economic sanctions by the UN Security Council would be 
inevitable. This was revealed by a government source. The 
Japanese Government -- primarily, the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, and 
the Ministry of Finance -- will soon begin studying taking such 
specific measures as restricting trade with North Korea and 
stopping remittances to North Korea by Korean residents in 
Japan. In the Japan-U.S. summit meeting on 11 February, Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa also wants to confirm that Japan will 
maintain close contact with the United States on ways to deal 
with North Korea. 
  Since North Korea declared its withdrawal from the Nuclear 
Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) in March last year, Japan has 
continued to take a cautious attitude of watching the question 
of enforcing economic sanctions against North Korea, hoping the 
matter will be resolved through the U.S.-DPRK talks and 
South-North Korea dialogue. 
  But the DPRK-IAEA talks underway since late last month, 
which 
came on the heels of the U.S.-DPRK talks, again reached an 
impasse. The situation is now such that (according to a UN 
diplomatic source) it looks as if "there is no choice but to 
begin discussions on economic sanctions against North Korea" if 
the IAEA, at its Executive Council meeting on 21 and 22 
February, decides to move the North Korean question onto the UN 
Security Council. Under such circumstances, Japan, the United 
States, and South Korea held a working-level meeting in New York 
on 4 February to discuss measures to deal with the situation. 
  If the UN Security Council decides on economic sanctions, 
the 
Japanese Government will begin revising government rules on 
trade control, foreign exchange control, and control of entry 
into, and departure from, the country as necessary; it wants to 
freeze money remittance channels such as ships traveling between 
Niigata and Wonsan (North Korea), and foreign banks in such 
places as Hong Kong. 
  According to trade statistics for 1992, Japan-DPRK trade 
included: 28.28 billion yen in exports from Japan of products 
like textiles and machinery products, and 22.68 billion yen in 
imports from North Korea of textiles, nonmetallic minerals, and 
others. It has recently been learned that some Japanese 
products including high-tech equipment have been converted to 
military use. Concerns have also been raised over the reports 
that Korean residents in Japan are sending funds to the tune of 
60 to 100 billion yen a year to North Korea. 
  Furthermore, the Japan-U.S. summit meeting on 11 February is 
expected to take up the policy on North Korea, and to confirm 
the position: "If IAEA security measures do not transpire, Japan 
and the United States should cooperate in deciding on what to do 
as the next step." A government source said: "It is clear 
`what the next step' means." Thus he indicated that enforcing 
economic sanctions will be considered step by step.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 10 Feb 94 Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] On the morning of 9 February, Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa was briefed on the economic outlook for fiscal 
1994, including a projected 2.4 percent growth target for 
Japan's gross domestic product (GDP). The briefing was given at 
the prime minister's official residence by Tsutomu Tanaka, 
administrative vice minister of the Economic Planning Agency 
[EPA], and other top EPA officials. During the briefing, the 
prime minister expressed doubt about achieving the 2.4 percent 
growth target because the figure was much higher than the 
average 0.6 percent forecast by private research organizations. 
  According to Tanaka, Hosokawa said: "Will this target really 
be attained?" The prime minister's concern stems from the fact 
that recent government economic forecasts have been far from the 
actual state of the economy, Tanaka said. 
  It is very unusual for a prime minister to question the 
economic growth target which has been agreed upon by the EPA, 
the Finance Ministry, and the Ministry of International Trade 
and Industry. 
  Tanaka explained to the prime minister: "When the economy is 
flagging, private research organizations tend to calculate a low 
economic growth rate with a pessimistic view. This is why there 
are big gaps between the economic growth rate forecast by the 
government and those calculated by private organizations. A 
series of government pump-priming measures will bring about the 
desired effect this year and the economy will be put on the road 
to recovery." In this way, he stressed that it was possible to 
achieve the 2.4 percent target. According to Tanaka, the prime 
minister eventually accepted his explanation and said: "I 
understand."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Work Out Reputable Tax System Reform Plans"] </F>
  [Text] The tax issue, over which political turmoil has 
continued ever since Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa announced 
his "national welfare tax" plan, has finally been settled for 
the time being. 
  However, the agreement among coalition leaders -- setting 
aside the amount of tax cuts -- leaves us with a strong 
impression that the scattered manner in which tax cuts are to be 
made and how a source of revenue to make up for them is to be 
ensured are merely stop-gap measures. We deeply regret this. 
  Granted, it could not be helped considering the impending 
situation regarding the political timetable, including the 
implementation of pump-priming measures, compilation of the 
draft budget for the next fiscal year, and the upcoming 
Japan-U.S. summit meeting. However, the problem has merely been 
shelved, as the issue of financial insurance for tax cuts has 
now been left completely up to discussions among the ruling 
coalition parties. 
  The greatest concern is that there is no real guarantee that 
an agreement on the source of revenue to make up for tax cuts 
will be reached by a consultative body made up of members from 
the ruling coalition parties. 
  According to the statement of accord among coalition 
leaders, 
legislation on a source of revenue is to be enacted during a 
Diet session by the year end. However, there is a precondition 
that this can only be done "under agreement among the ruling 
coalition parties." If the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ], which is the largest contingent among the ruling 
coalition parties, should decide to voice opposition to a tax 
hike, threatening once again to "break away from the coalition 
government," there is no guarantee the tax issue will not be 
shelved again. 
  Moreover, unified local elections are to be held in the 
spring of 1995, and an upper house election is to be held the 
following summer. Depending on the political situation, there 
may even be a lower house election. As the time for elections 
get closer and closer, election-motivated opposition to tax 
hikes will inevitably grow stronger. 
  Meanwhile, coalition leaders have also agreed to implement a 
6-trillion-yen tax cut plan (which includes 5.5 trillion yen in 
income and residence tax cuts) retroactive to 1 January, for 
which the legislation is to be effective for one year only. 
  This means that if legislation for securing a revenue source 
for tax cuts should not be enacted by the year end, the tax cut 
plan will be cut off thereafter. In that case, the pump-priming 
effects of the 15-trillion yen economic stimulus package will go 
to waste. 
  Furthermore, the planned tax cuts rely heavily on 
deficit-covering bonds as a revenue source. The ruling 
coalition parties should make a thorough review of these matters 
and strive to come up with a responsible decision. 
  The responsibility mentioned here does not simply mean that 
the ruling coalition parties should look from a short-term 
viewpoint to study the issue of finding a revenue source for tax 
cuts. It also means they should look from a medium- to 
long-term viewpoint to study the issue of how the tax system 
ought to be in preparation for the coming of an aging society; 
and particularly, the issue of drastic tax system reform which 
includes rectifying the balance between direct and indirect 
taxes. 
  This is why we have basically supported the "Hosokawa plan," 
despite such faults as the abrupt manner in which it was 
announced, the sudden changing of the consumption tax name, and 
the nontransparent decisionmaking process. 
  Although the "Hosokawa plan" has basically been brought back 
to the drawing board, it still bears significance for bringing 
problems out into the open. Clearly, the current tax system 
which leans heavily toward direct taxation centered on income 
taxes will eventually collapse as the society rapidly progresses 
to a state in which one out of every four Japanese will be over 
65 years old. 
  There may be divided views on whether a 7-percent tax rate 
is 
reasonable. However, it is impossible to shift the strain of 
the burden of rapidly rising pension, medical, and nursing costs 
to workers in the prime of their lives. Regardless of name, 
indirect taxes -- particularly the consumption tax -- must be 
raised, and it is inevitable. 
  It is the politician's duty to continue striving to gain 
public approval by sharing the pain with the people, while 
taking such future prospects into consideration. It is 
desirable that a reputable plan on tax system reform be worked 
out and presented to the people as soon as possible. Sweet 
promises should not be made merely to put off the issue.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ichiro Ozawa, secretary-general of Shinseito </F>
(Japan Renewal Party), by commentator Yasusuke Ueda; place and 
date not given; first 11 paragraphs Ueda's introduction] 
  [Text] The year 1993 marks an epoch in the political 
history of the post-World War II period: the collapse of 
one-party rule by the Liberal Democratic Party and the birth of 
the coalition government. The commotion of political reform 
touched off by this situation has directly stirred up the 
political community, and there are no immediate signs of 
tranquility. 
  The economic community is panting for breath in the 
recession 
which is said to be the worst following the war, and there is no 
immediate prospect of economic recovery. A glance at the world 
situation shows no visible signs of the reconstruction of world 
order following the end of the Cold War. 
  They say you had better learn from history when the future 
is 
unpredictable. In order to "clearly" anticipate the immediate 
future, it is necessary to "steadily" look back on the immediate 
past. In the immediate past we had the same situation as we are 
experiencing now -- that is, the transitional period called the 
Taisho era. The following are rough comparisons: 
<H5>  Domestic Politics </H5>
  Taisho era: There existed the decline of the clan government 
and the beginning of party politics. In the background lies the 
mutability of the general public as symbolized by rice riots, as 
well as a tendency toward political participation as seen in 
campaigns for universal suffrage. 
  Heisei era: This era witnessed the end of one-party rule by 
the Liberal Democratic Party, and the indignation of public 
opinion at the repetition of scandals. In the background lies a 
mass society engagaed in television politics. 
<H5>  Economics </H5>
  Taisho era: There existed the rapid expansion of economics 
due to the wartime boom of World War I and the rehabilitation 
boom after World War I, and the chronic recession which came 
soon after the collapse of the bubble economy. 
  Heisei era: Japan became an economic superpower through high 
economic growth, heading for the bubble economy. Japan has 
suddenly fallen into a prolonged recession. 
<H5>  International Situation] </H5>
  Taisho era: This era witnessed the collapse of the Imperial 
Government of Germany and the Russian Empire, as well as the 
collapse of the old European order; the dissolution of the 
Anglo-Japanese Alliance; the emergence of the antagonism between 
Japan and the United States; and the intensification of the 
nationalistic movement of China. 
  Heisei era: The stability maintained by the balance between 
the United States and the Soviet Union has been weakened due to 
the collapse of the Soviet Union. There has also occurred a 
continuation of the economic friction between Japan and the 
United States, as well as the rapid upsurge of the Chinese 
economy. 
  The greatest person in the political community of the Taisho 
era was Takashi Hara. Hara, who organized a party government 
for the first time in Japan, was called the "common" prime 
minister. The organization of a cabinet by both a prime 
minister who was neither a veteran statesman of the Imperial 
Restoration of Meiji nor a bureaucrat and soldier, and by party 
men, was the greatest political reform of that time. Now in the 
period of Heisei, when political reform is urged similarly, the 
key man in the current political situation is Ichiro Ozawa. 
There is always a violent blizzard of arguments for and against 
his speech and behavior. This proves he is the center of 
attention. 
  [Text] Ozawa says "he learns from history." Therefore, we 
have asked him to tell us his views on the political climate and 
economics, with due consideration for the immediate past. 
However, we refrained from asking his observations on the 
current political situation, which is constantly on the move. 
Instead, we wanted to know about the path of the immediate 
future as it exists in the mind of Ichiro Ozawa, a politician. 
<H3>  In the Period of "Adjustment," Real Politicians Were not 
Needed </H3>
  [Ueda] In your book entitled "Plan for Reforming Japan," you 
cited four politicians from whom we should learn: Toshimichi 
Okubo, Hirobumi Ito, Takashi Hara, and Shigeru Yoshida. All of 
them exercised great leadership at the turning point of their 
times. What is interesting about Japan is that times changed in 
an approximately forty-year cycle from the Meiji era. 
  The first period is from the Meiji Restoration to the 
Russo-Japanese War. The first leader is Okubo, who is followed 
by Ito. 
  The second period lasted for forty years till the end of the 
Pacific war. Party politics, founded by Takashi Hara, collapsed 
and was replaced by a military dictatorship. 
  The foundation of the third period was established by 
Shigeru 
Yoshida. The period covered forty years, in which we 
experienced postwar rehabilitation, high economic growth, and 
became an economic superpower. It was a fortunate period in 
comparison with the preceding two, for we experienced no war or 
decisive crisis. That fortunate period has at last come to an 
end, and we have entered a turning point. 
  In greeting the fourth period, what do you think politicians 
should do? 
  [Ozawa] You have classified the times into three periods. I 
do not think excessive political action is necessary when a 
period moves on stable rails. Such a period requires 
administrative ability. The idea is that a two-sworded samurai 
is not needed in time of peace. In time of change, however, 
politicians in particular are required to possess a knowledge of 
the times and a knowledge of history, as well as the discernment 
and judgment necessary to foresee the current of the times and 
of history -- to have such abilities and the power to translate 
such abilities into practice. 
  Take the third period, for example. That was the high 
economic growth period after the end of World War II. Even in 
world politics it was a fortunate period, for Japan had the 
least responsibilities. All politicians had to do was 
redistribute the wealth as impartially as possible. In my view, 
this so-called "adjustment" was almost the sole responsibility 
for politicians to perform. 
  However, the time has come for Japan to share responsibility 
in international politics and international economics, which are 
the prerequisites for the creation and maintenance of wealth and 
peace. With the world order in doubt due to the collapse of the 
Cold War structure, Japan has entered an age in which the 
politicians must have a mid-term vision and a perspective on 
Japan's way of life, at least in preparation for the 21st 
century; otherwise, they cannot function as politicians. 
  [Ueda] What is inevitable for Japanese politicians is that 
they must pay attention to human relations of a rural style, 
while simultaneuosly managing modern bureaucratic and 
parliamentary systems of the western style. Party-type men are 
strong in the former, and bureaucratic-type men are strong in 
the latter, but there are very few politicians who are strong in 
both and who can create a vision. 
  This leads to the cause for breeding the dual power 
structure. Takashi Hara had two types of abilities, and kept his 
political party as firm as rock. What do you think of this dual 
power structure? 
  [Ozawa] In Japan, ability is classified into two types: 1) 
the ability necessary to smoothly carry forward human relations 
and social establishments which are indigenous to Japan; and 2) 
discernment, ideas, and the ability to formulate policy, with 
the international community within one's vision. In Japanese 
politics following the end of the war, politicians needed only 
the ability of adjustment within Japanese society. 
  Takashi Hara is a major senior citizen in my home town. 
He placated the kingpins of the clan government like Aritomo 
Yamagata who were still alive and who exercised power even 
though they were weakened; he installed party politics and 
parliamentary politics in the center of the power structure; and 
he tried to develop foreign policies. His character aside, he 
was to be the leader of the times of the Meiji era, next to 
Toshimichi Okubo. 
  If he had been alive, the history of Showa might have been 
different. Because he died, party politics thereafter ended up 
being politics concerned primarily with human relations or 
political relations within Japan, which eventually led to our 
mistake. 
<H5>  Japan Will Sink if It Indulges in an Inward-Looking Attitude </H5>
  The political leaders of the Meiji era turned their eyes to 
the international community, widening their mental horizon. For 
good or evil, they were conscious of being leaders on the road 
from feudalism to modernization. They controlled themselves as 
leaders although emotionally they were Japanese. This 
consciousness gave rise to the progress of the Meiji era. 
  Postwar politics came into being in the midst of the 
protection by the United States and during the confrontation 
between the two great camps -- the United States and the Soviet 
Union. No sooner had this framework been removed than Japan 
became unable to cope with the international community. 
Therefore, the Japanese way of thinking has not essentially 
changed -- Japan is inward-looking. 
  The reason I use the exaggerated phrase "the second opening 
of Japan" is that unless Japan can overcome the inward-looking 
period of 1980-1990 and guide itself again -- in a sense, like 
it did in the Meiji era -- with foreign countries within its 
view, in my view it will surely sink. 
  [Ueda] That requires powerful leadership, but are there 
necessary conditions for accepting such leadership? 
  [Ozawa] The Japanese have a strong tendency to revert to an 
inward-looking attitude typical of the Japanese. The Meiji 
Restoration produced such a change and such leaders through a 
sense of crisis, for Japan as it stood at that time would have 
become a colony under the imperialism of the Western powers. 
The Japanese people were aware of this and accepted it. The 
Meiji Restoration is a great revolution on a world scale. 
  However, the Japanese have lived within the narrow confines 
for thousands of years, and the moment their leaders die they 
lose their awareness and tend to become inward-looking. That is 
an easier way to live; therefore, they tend to evade directly 
dealing with problems such as international isues. That is the 
problem. 
  However, that does not make living difficult for the 
Japanese, nor is Japan in danger of being invaded because of 
external factors. Although the Japanese are well aware of the 
existence of problems, they fail to squarely confront them. 
Therefore, good leaders are thought to be men who are not exact 
but who are moderately affable and gentle. 
  Such a mood prevails not only in the political world, but 
also in companies, bureaucratic organizations, and everywhere. 
People dislike men who freely express themselves or freely 
exercise leadership. 
  [Ueda] Takashi Hara was different, was he not? 
  [Ozawa] Hara probably thought things as they existed at that 
time would not do. He considered what he should do for the next 
era. However, he fell because the Japanese could not keep up 
with him. Therein lies the difference between the people's 
awareness of that time and during the closing days of the 
Tokugawa government. Following the end of World War I, the 
Japanese indulged in the idea of both Japan being a great 
country and of the bubble economy. They had an incorrect idea 
of true democracy and became the ignorant crowd, shouting 
"democracy" and "culture." The people at that time could not 
yet accept a man like Takashi Hara who possessed powerful 
leadership and beliefs. 
  What the politicians should learn is that thereafter 
politics 
ceased to function and the awareness of the people declined, 
losing the possibility of future growth. In short, the people 
indulged in egocentric emotionalism, which is characteristic of 
the Japanese, and politics lost its responsibility, propelled by 
a slogan "Forward, forward! Go, go! Do not stop." I think the 
steering of politics at the turning point of history is very 
important. 
<H3>  The Inability To Issue Deficit-Covering Bonds Is Due to the 
Lack of Political Power </H3>
  [Ueda] There was a great recession early in the Showa era. 
With the outbreak of the Manchurian incident, the attention of 
the people was drawn to that, and party politics in Japan ceased 
to exist. Was it not true that politics could not overcome the 
recession? 
  [Ozawa] It was due to the absence of politicians who had not 
only knowledge of economic problems, but also vision, judgment, 
and leadership. Anyway, the Japanese are an extremely emotional 
people, but if politicians also form emotional judgments, that 
is the end of Japan. The role of politicians is to calmly draw 
objective conclusions no matter what the people say. 
  Politicians exist to form correct judgments at crucial 
times, 
even though they are asleep after the usual drinks of sake. Why 
can the Japanese not understand this despite the enormous 
sacrifices they suffered in their history? 
  [Ueda] The seriousness of the recession at that time cannot 
be compared with that of the current recession. The upturn of 
the economy began at the time of Finance Minister Korekiyo 
Takahashi following the collapse of the party cabinet due to the 
15th May incident. He expanded government finances by issuing 
deficit-covering bonds, which was also to raise military 
expenses for the Manchurian incident. He extricated Japan from 
the great recession through that means. We are deficient in 
ideas expressed by financiers or statesmen, are we not? 
  [Ozawa] We have exhausted every theory and wisdom. As you 
have said, if we adopt an inflationary policy by issuing 
deficit-covering bonds, without fail that will function as a 
kind of lever for economic recovery. However, we will fail if 
we stimulate business activity via a temporary munitions boom or 
in areas where demand is not constantly created. 
  The idea of issuing deficit-covering bonds is necessary. 
However, we must establish a comprehensive policy by which we 
can confirm that issuing bonds will lead to regular 
reproduction, or to the development of a new field, or to the 
accumulation of social capital; otherwise the idea of issuing 
bonds will be defective as a concrete plan. 
  My opinion is we can do it if we want to; to our regret, 
political power is not strong enough for that. 
  Conversely, the lack of political power means the people 
still do not have such awareness. The reason is because we are 
still rich. That makes a great difference. However, if we are 
placed in a situation where we are unable to eat starting 
tomorrow, the seriousness of the people's awareness will be 
quite different. 
  However, the people's understanding is increasing 
considerably. Therefore, I directly tell them about the problems 
of agriculture or rice. My belief is that if I talk to them, 
they will understand. Among the people, however, there is a 
feeling: "We understand, but the situation is not serious 
enough." 
  However weak that feeling may be, such feelings makes the 
politicians hesitant, which makes them liars in the end. That 
causes distrust in politics, bringing about adverse effects. 
<H3>  It Is Irresponsible for Enterprises To Ask for the 
Government's Help Without Making Efforts To Help Themselves </H3>
  [Ueda] You have said politics does not have the power to 
issue deficit-covering bonds. Does that refer to the present 
administration? 
  [Ozawa] No, not to the present administration. Even the 
administration of the Liberal Democratic Party is not much 
different from the present administration. 
  The awareness of the people will deepen if employment 
adjustment becomes more serious. Since the people have a vague 
sense of anxiety, they refrain from spending. They feel anxiety 
because they have not yet formed a clear view of the future, not 
because they are at death's door. 
  The people are merely tightening the purse strings; they 
do have money. The number of people who traveled abroad 
increased compared with that of last year. Although the total 
amount of travel expenses decreased, people went to places where 
the cost was moderate. 
  This is the case with enterprises, for more than half of the 
people in enterprises are still optimistic. They are not 
serious enough. For the last two or three years since the 
collapse of the bubble economy, I have said the current 
recession is a structural one, and that a small amount of fiscal 
expenditure or financial policy will never boost the economy. I 
told the same story to the "Keidanren" (Japan Federation of 
Economic Organizations) people, but they did not listen 
seriously to me. 
  [Ueda] The business community is complaining that politics 
is insensitive to the economy.... 
  [Ozawa] It is the enterprises which are insensitive to the 
situation. I said positively in my speech to the business 
community: "You are solely responsible for the bubble economy. 
You have had the audacity to say that economics is first rate 
and politics is third rate. Why does the first-rater come to 
the third-rater for help now? If you are a first-rater, do it 
yourself." 
  They are wholly responsible for themselves. Politics is 
responsible in that it failed to control the situation and did 
not have the proper economic perspective. However, it was they 
that pushed for doing so. 
  Whether in the automobile or other industries, they have 
increased the working force and equipment investment twofold, 
and are gasping for breath. That is their own doing. A little 
sober reflection will tell you that eternal high economic growth 
is impossible. 
  [Ueda] Which means they have no other recourse but 
self-help? 
  [Ozawa] No, self-help is just one means to an end. English 
words are much in vogue now, like "restructuring." They have to 
restructure themselves, with careful attention to their own 
foothold. Enterprises must restructure themselves so they can 
live not only under slow and stable growth, but also in a mature 
domestic society where demand consists of buying new items in 
place of those that are worn out. Enterprises must make an 
effort in every field, including personnel expenses and others. 
  In that case, the expansion of the economy will cease 
temporarily; therefore, aggregate demands must be somehow 
maintained in its place. Accordingly, government expenditures 
will be increased drastically, even if deficit-covering bonds 
are issued. 
  Since Japan is a third-rate country in stock matters, it has 
much to obtain -- such as its living environment, information, 
communication, housing, and the Shinkansen (a high-speed 
passenger railroad system). While maintaining aggregate demands 
for such items, we will accumulate stock. In the meantime, the 
business community will curtail itself, making itself slim. 
These two must be undertaken simultaneously. 
  The problem with the business community is that it is 
irresponsible, keeps its fatty diabetic constitution intact, 
asks the government for help, and asks the government to usher 
in a good age without any suffering on its part. That is asking 
too much, is it not? 
  There is a story about the use of public funds to write off 
bad debts held by financial institutions. It is not that I am 
against it. However, it is unreasonable for financial 
institutions to ask for the use of public funds to write off all 
their bad debts caused by the inflation of the bubble through 
their indiscriminate lending of money. Unless they reform 
themselves, there is no reason for the nation to provide funds 
for particular enterprises, and enterprises which have conducted 
irresponsible management at that. 
  However, it is quite another story if they say: "We will 
take responsibility by reducing our weight by half. All 
officers will resign. We will reduce our salaries by half. 
Therefore, allow us to use the nation's funds for the 
maintenance of a financial system and for the economy of the 
nation as a whole." 
<H3>  There Is a Danger of North Korea's Attacking Japanese 
Nuclear Power Plants With Conventional Missiles </H3>
  [Ueda] Concerning international problems, Takashi Hara saw 
that Japan should not go to war with the United States even if 
it was obliged to make concessions. Presently the tension 
between Japan and the United States is similar to what occurred 
then. 
  [Ozawa] The United States is still powerful. In addition, 
it has the potentiality for remaining a mighty power. 
  Looking back historically over the Japan-U.S. relationship, 
we find the Japan-U.S. relationship inevitably changes about ten 
years before the turning point in Japan. Therefore, Japan is 
always hit about ten years later. The trade friction between 
Japan and the United States has been brewing for nearly the past 
ten years. 
  The modernization of Japan was prodded by the United States, 
and with guns at that. It was the United States which 
restrained and checked Japan, and it was the United States which 
inflicted a crushing defeat on Japan. But it was also the 
United States which reconstructed Japan. We should give weight 
to the realities of this history. 
  [Ueda] Takashi Hara pointed out that "the Chinese problem is 
the U.S. problem" -- the interests of Japan and the United 
States will clash over China. 
  [Ozawa] That will hold true in the future. There is no 
change in that. The Russian problem will be attached to the 
Chinese problem, and Japan's interests will clash with U.S. 
interests over Chinese-Russian problems. The watertight liaison 
and cooperation between Japan and the United States are 
prerequisite to safety. Moreover, the North Korean problem will 
present the greatest threat to Japan. 
  [Ueda] From the military point of view, the attack on 
Japanese nuclear power plants with conventional missiles will 
have the same effect as atomic bombs. 
  [Ozawa] There is a fair possibility of that. Japan had 
better prepare for an attack in the belief there will be one. 
However, since the Japanese are happy-go-lucky, they will never 
think about it. 
  I have talked with a very influential American, and we 
completely agree on North Korea. 
  Concerning Japan's cooperation with other Asian nations, 
Japan's credibility is now such that no Asian nation will trust 
Japan once Japan's relationship with the United States is 
severed, because Japan has been doing nothing but robbing and 
earning without giving anything back. It is necessary for Japan 
to make steady efforts in that direction for generations to come. 
  [Ueda] The Japanese are unmindful, thinking everything will 
come out all right. 
  [Ozawa] The Japanese are a very happy-go-lucky people. 
(laughter) 
  [Ueda] With the international situation in a state of flux, 
it is necessary for politics to regain its centripetal force. 
However, there is a troublesome problem -- the problem of 
political activities and money. 
  [Ozawa] Money is everything nowadays, is it not? It is 
politicians who are responsible for developing such a tendency, 
but really good politics and politicians will be not be created 
unless the awareness and tendencies of the nation are changed. 
It is necessary for the nation to be conscious of this. We 
must take action before everything gets out of order. 
  For another, the Japanese are reluctant to bear the cost 
of politics in every sense. It is not that the people should 
entrust a lot of money to individual politicians; it is 
necessary for the people themselves to trim the cost of 
politics. But they must give necessary money to politicians. 
They are making a great fuss over politics without bearing any 
of its cost. 
  Politicians exist to steer Japan in the right direction at 
critical moments. Ignoring this, the people expect politicians 
to do trifles for them every day, like repairing the ditches 
behind their houses. Politicians are so busy rendering services 
to the people, they do not have time to think about Japan's 
future. 
  Politicians do not think about Japan's future unless they 
are 
required to do so, because they are most highly evaluated when 
they render trivial services to the people, like repairing 
ditches. Consequently, politics degenerates further and further. 
I think the people are responsible for that. I am being 
attacked because I always say such things. (laughter) 
  [Ueda] It is about time for you to come to the fore. 
  [Ozawa] I have not yet been asked to do that. The time is 
not ripe. Look at what the media is doing every day. All it 
does is find fault with me and heap criticism and slander on me. 
Its awareness of the seriousness of the situation is not enough. 
  [Ueda] Are you thinking about coming to the fore when the 
opportunity is ripe? 
  [Ozawa] It would be best if the time never came when it 
would be necessary for me to thrust myself forward. Then I do 
not have to be overly serious.

<F P=106> [By Harufumi Kiyoda] </F>
  [Text] Seoul, 8 Feb -- Hwang Pyang-tae, South Korean 
ambassador to China who is now temporarily back in Seoul, met 
with an ASAHI SHIMBUN reporter on 8 February and disclosed his 
noteworthy views on North Korea. Hwang said that since last 
November, North Korean President Kim Il-song has again started 
"his direct rule over the nation" in dealing with issues of top 
priority such as the alleged DPRK nuclear development so as to 
get over the most serious crisis ever since the nation's 
founding; and that North Korea is now moving toward implementing 
the policy of granting limited rights of independent cultivation 
to farmers, which is a policy basically modeled on the reform 
program that was started in China in the late 1970's, as well as 
the policy of setting up special economic zones. 
  As for the reasons why President Kim is restoring "his 
direct 
administration," Ambassador Hwang cited the following points: 
members of the "interim generation," meaning the generation born 
between the first and second revolutionary generations and 
including Kim's brother Kim Yong-chu, have been reappointed to 
front-line political posts in the personnel reshuffle last 
December; Secretary Kim Chong-il as well as other prospective 
leaders of his generation such as Kim Tal-hyun and Kim Yong-sun 
are now made to play only lesser roles; and in his recent talks 
with various guests such as UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali, American missionary Billy Graham, and VIP's from 
China, President Kim Il-song hinted at his posture of directly 
controlling the state administration. 
  However, Ambassador Hwang also pointed out that the 
restoration of President Kim's direct rule seems to be limited 
at this point to important pending diplomatic issues such the 
nuclear issue, the normalization of diplomatic relations with 
the United States and Japan, and the issue on dealing with the 
south on the one hand, and those issues related to the basic 
principle of the government administration on the other. For 
example, there are problems related to the partial reform and 
open-door policy, which was started on a trial basis by leaders 
of the second revolutionary generation such as Secretary Kim 
Chong-il but which has now come to a deadlock. 
  Secretary Kim Chong-il has so far rejected the Chinese-type 
reform and open-door policy, terming it as "revisionism". 
However, President Kim Il-song sent Secretary Hwang Chang-yop 
to China early this year to put an end to its relations with 
China which have become rather awkward since China established 
diplomatic relations with the ROK in the summer of 1992, and at 
the same time to instruct him to make an inspection tour of 
special economic zones in Shenzhen and Zhuhai. It is reported 
that experts in economic affairs have been dispatched to special 
economic zones since then. 
  Ambassador Hwang also maintained that President Kim 
Il-song's 
intention to restore his direct control is not an indication of 
his attempt to change his decision on assigning Kim Chong-il as 
his successor. As a basis for this observation, Ambassador 
Hwang cited the fact that Kim Pyong-il -- who is Kim Chong-il's 
half brother and who had returned home late last year after 
completing his assignment as ambassador to Bulgaria -- has been 
reappointed as ambassador to Finland.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Hoang Huan: "The Truth About the </F>
Establishment of Radio Democratic Asia"] 
  [Text] During the "Cold War," the United States had more 
than 40 radio stations which were all run by the CIA and which 
were designed for instigation and ideological sabotage in the 
world. Of these, the three largest radio stations were the 
Voice of America, VOA, which, headquartered in Washington, was 
under USIS, the U.S. Information Service; Radio "Free Europe" 
which, headquartered in Munich in the Federal Republic of 
Germany, was targeted at the East European countries; and Radio 
"Freedom," which was targeted at the former Soviet Union. 
  When the Cold War was over, a number of people suggested 
dissolving Radio "Free Europe" and Radio "Freedom" because the 
main goal of these two stations had been achieved: communist 
rule over European countries no longer existed. But U.S. 
President Clinton holds a different view. He wants to maintain 
Radio "Free Europe" and Radio "Freedom." He is also calling for 
the setting up of Radio "Democratic Asia" [Chaau As Daan Chur], 
arguing that, just like Europe, Asia is a continent with an 
important role and a strategic position. In the current 
situation, the role and strategic position of Asia are all the 
more important. With a large population, Asia now has some 170 
million English-speaking people. The United States must have a 
sense of responsibility toward Asia, especially at a time when 
there is a "new-type Cold War," that is, a peaceful evolution 
strategy, the purpose of which is Asian domination. More 
importantly, this strategy is also aimed at eradicating 
communist nations, including Vietnam. 
  That is the reason for the coming into life of Radio 
"Democratic Asia." This radio, headquartered in a borrowed 
place in Asia, has constantly beamed distorting broadcasts 
against socioeconomic reforms and social progress in various 
Asian countries. It has also carried news about various 
activities on the U.S. mainland and about the exemplary role 
played by the United States overseas. 
  Looking back over the years, we will see that Washington has 
been very keen on using radio to spread propaganda in Asia. 
Since August 1986, Washington has used the airwaves of a radio, 
which is also called Radio "Freedom" (located in Thailand and 
operating with U.S. technological and financial assistance) to 
regularly beam broadcasts in English, French, Vietnamese, and 
Thai. From late 1992 to early 1993, Mrs. Helen D.Bentley, a 
Republican member of the House of Representatives, put forth a 
proposal calling for the establishment of Radio "Free Asia." 
Then on 15 June 1993, President Clinton came up with a proposal 
to set up Radio Democratic Asia and to organize an ad-hoc 
committee with its members appointed by the president himself to 
manage the operations of various radio stations such as the 
Voice of America, VOA; Radio "Free Europe"; and Radio "Freedom." 
More specifically, this new committee will replace the old Board 
of International Broadcasting and will be responsible for 
establishing Radio "Democratic Asia," whose broadcasts are to be 
directed at those countries which, according to Clinton, lack 
democracy, such as Vietnam, China, Myanmar [Burma], North Korea, 
and so forth. 
  The U.S. Government has set aside $30 million from its 
budget 
for the running of Radio "Democratic Asia." When talking about 
his proposal at the White House, Clinton stated: "The purposes 
for the maintenance of Radio "Free Europe" and Radio "Freedom" 
and for the establishment of Radio "Democratic Asia" are to help 
consolidate democratic institutions in various areas, both in 
Europe and Asia, where there is an absence of democracy. People 
in undemocratic countries still need genuine information which 
should be free from being doctored or distorted by the local 
administration." (!) 
  President Clinton's new proposal has won strong support from 
many congressmen, including Senators Russell Feingold and Joseph 
R. Biden -- two very powerful figures at the U.S. Senate in this 
matter. 
  On learning of the decision on the setting up of Radio 
"Democratic Asia," a number of reactionary political 
organizations among the exiled Vietnamese in foreign countries 
appear to have been delighted. They regarded this as a 
long-awaited victorious step in the "democratic construction 
strategy" for Asia in general and for Vietnam in particular. 
  But "anything rational will remain, while anything 
irrational 
will go bust." They might have forget this age-old axiom. That 
is why they have displayed their ecstacy too soon.

<F P=106> [Lunar new year message to the nation by President Le Duc </F>
Anh; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Dear countrymen and comrades: On the occasion of 
the Vietnamese traditional new year and on behalf of the party 
and state, I cordially extend my kind regards, greetings, and 
best wishes to all countrymen, comrades, and combatants 
throughout the country and to Vietnamese abroad. I would like 
also to convey my friendly greetings to our foreign friends who 
are celebrating the lunar new year in our country. 
  During the past few years, despite swift and complicated 
changes in the international situation and despite the heavy war 
consequences and prolonged U.S. embargo against us, we have 
scored important achievements. Our economy has consistently 
developed, our people's spiritual and material life improved, 
our political situation stabilized, and our diplomatic 
activities expanded. These initial achievements have enhanced 
our people's confidence and enthusiasm and have won admiration 
from our friends around the world. This success has once again 
testified to our people's great creativity, vigorous energy to 
surge forward, and profound sentiments toward our friends both 
near and far. 
  It can be said that today we have sufficient internal 
factors 
to ensure firm and long-lasting political security. We also 
have a firm base to maintain peace on a long-term basis and many 
prerequisites to lead our nation toward a new stage -- the stage 
of national industrialization and modernization. 
  In the years ahead, our party, state, people, and the armed 
forces must strengthen their unity to enhance experiences, 
uphold the spirit of national independence and sovereignty, 
expand international cooperation, seriously practice diligence, 
thrift, honesty, and righteousness; develop creativity, and 
accelerate the renovation process. With great efforts to carry 
out these tasks, we will surely be able to overcome all 
difficulties and ordeals and score new, ever greater 
achievements on the path of building socialism to attain the 
goals of making our people prosperous, our nation powerful, and 
our society just and civilized, thereby step by step building 
our country more beautiful and prosperous as wished by our 
esteemed beloved President Ho Chi Minh. 
  I wish all countrymen, comrades, combatants, and families 
throughout the country good health, happiness, and prosperity in 
the new year.

<F P=106> [Editorial from 10 February NHAN DAN: "The Spring of </F>
Opportunities and Challenges"] 
  [Text] With this Vietnamese traditional new year, we have 
entered the eighth year of implementing the renovation process. 
During the past years, we have surmounted numerous acute 
difficulties and surged forward. We have taken a very important 
step in curbing the socioeconomic crisis. The capabilities of 
our nation, people, party, and state have been enhanced amid 
difficulties and hardships. The achievements recorded on the 
internal and international fronts have created new opportunities 
for national development. 
  However, our nation is still poor and the results of our 
economic activity are insufficient and uncertain. At the same 
time, hostile forces are attempting to undermine us, and social 
vices -- especially corruption and lavish spending -- are still 
prevalent. These are the great ordeals in our efforts to advance 
along the path chosen by our esteemed Uncle Ho, the party, and 
the people, which is aimed at making our people prosperous, our 
nation powerful, and our society just and civilized so as to 
catch up with developments in countries around the world. 
  Indeed, our past achievements have created favorable 
conditions for our country to enter a new stage of development. 
New opportunities as well as some acute ordeals are currently 
placing increased demands on our nation's capabilities. People 
throughout the country are concentrating their efforts to 
accelerate development by attaching importance to agriculture 
and changing the economic structure in the direction of 
industrialization and modernization. Efforts are also being 
made to improve social welfare, strengthen political stability, 
and consolidate national defense and security, thereby helping 
to extricate the nation from its socioeconomic crisis and lead 
it to a new, firm developmental position. 
  Spring always comes with prospects; the greater the 
prospects, the more efforts must be made to attain them. We 
must seize opportunities to overcome any obstacles and only by 
overcoming obstacles will we be able to advance further. We 
must bear in mind that all developments depend chiefly on 
internal strength. People throughout the country are united and 
heading in the same direction, and as a result new opportunities 
will be seized and developed in the new year.

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanichaphak has 
rejected as untrue the observations made by certain elements in 
the Thai private sector that the Thai Government has been acting 
slowly in dealing with trade and investment in Vietnam following 
the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo. He told reporters that 
the Thai Government's consistent efforts to build economic 
cooperation with Vietnam and other neighboring countries was 
part of the impetus behind the U.S. private sector pressing 
their government to terminate the trade embargo. 
  The deputy prime minister said that soon after it first 
assumed office, the government began promoting trade with 
Vietnam as if there was no U.S. trade embargo. The government 
has extended the Mekong River development program to cover six 
countries, and is considering inviting China to participate in 
the scheme. Vietnam and Thailand are in the process of 
establishing energy cooperation, and Thailand plans to buy 
natural gas from Vietnam. The government intends to open a Thai 
investment promotion office in Vietnam, and is encouraging Thai 
commercial banks to open branches there. The number of Thai 
commercial banks currently operating in Vietnam is second only 
to France. Officials are working on a plan to link the two 
countries' telecommunications networks and promote investment in 
Vietnam's tourism industry. Meanwhile, the Thai Government has 
also provided gratis financial assistance to Vietnam. 
  Suphachai noted that the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo 
will help Thailand become the trade and investment center of the 
Indochinese region. Japan is using Thailand for that purpose. 
He said the private sector should realize the government cannot 
interfere in every matter. Its duty is merely to lay the 
foundation for them. He pointed out that the government only 
wants good investors to invest in foreign countries, not those 
who want to be brokers or middlemen and sell official permits to 
other investors.

  [Text] Two organisations, one public and one private, have 
decided to open new offices in Vietnam to exploit an expected 
increase in Thai business resulting from last week's lifting of 
the U.S. trade embargo. The two are the Government's Board of 
Investment [BoI] and the private sector's Thai Military Bank. 
The BoI will set up an office in Ho Chi Minh City, its first in 
Vietnam and seventh abroad, while Thai Military Bank says it 
will apply for a representative office--and ultimately a 
branch--in Hanoi to supplement its Ho Chi Minh office. 
  They see opportunities for Thai businesses both as suppliers 
and contractors for an expected increase in investment in 
Vietnam, and as manufacturers exploiting the newly created 
opportunity of exporting from Vietnam to the United States. 
  In addition to the opening of a Ho Chi Minh City office, the 
BoI's Vietnamese push will include an investment seminar next 
month, similar to one organised last month in Phnom Penh and, 
like the Phnom Penh event, timed to coincide with a visit by 
Prime Minister Chuan Likphai. The Ho Chi Minh City office will 
join the BoI's existing six offices abroad: in New York, 
Frankfurt, Sydney, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Paris. 
  Board secretary-general Sathaphon Kawitanon said it would 
also welcome the setting up of a special economic zone ("Zone 
4") in Thai border areas to increase cooperation with 
neighbouring countries and boost the competitiveness of Thai 
investment. 
  Thai Military Bank's decision to apply for a second 
representative office in Vietnam and ultimately a branch, both 
in Hanoi, follows what the bank reports to be a profit at its Ho 
Chi Minh City representative office after only one year. 
  Although Ho Chi Minh City is still considered to be the 
larger business centre, bank executives believe that a presence 
in Hanoi is needed to be closer to decision-making, including 
those involving infrastructure. 
  Bank president Thanong Phithaya and his executives believe 
that the lifting of the embargo will spark a growth in activity 
for Thai businesses. This will partly be to support the 
expected new American investment and related Vietnamese 
infrastructure projects, and partly to use Vietnam as a 
production base for exporting to the United States. 
  Dr Thanong said yesterday that Thai construction companies 
were already studying opportunities. Construction materials 
would also be needed for the project, executives sald. 
  Dr Wirasak Apharak, senior executive vice-president, said 
that Thai garment manufacturers wanted to invest in Vietnam in 
order to export to the United States because many categories of 
garments made in Thailand have hit their quota limits. But for 
the time being no one knows what exactly the trading terms will 
be after the lifting of the US embargo. 
  Dr Thanong said he expected approval for the representative 
office in Hanoi to be routine. Setting up a branch would take 
longer. 
  Thai Military Bank is one of only two Thai banks represented 
in Vietnam--the other is Bangkok Bank. 
  Executives say that while Bangkok Bank has concentrated on 
larger Thai corporations doing business in Vietnam, Thai 
Military Bank has been working with smaller operations, 
particularly imports of goods from Thailand into the Vietnamese 
markets where prices can be considerably higher. Dr Wirasak 
said that almost all motorcycles in Vietnam were made in 
Thailand and many were bought using Thai Military Bank credit. 
Thai Military Bank is also considering applying for a 
representative office and later a branch in Shanghai. It 
already has a joint venture bank in southern China. 
  The rationale for setting up in Shanghai is similar to that 
for Hanoi being close to where commercial decisions are being 
made. Dr Thanong is due to make a business trip to Shanghai in 
April. He said the request for a representative office was one 
of the subjects likely to be discussed. 
  The BoI's first step in establishing an office in Vietnam 
will be to send officials to cooperate with the Thai commercial 
counsellor's office in Ho Chi Minh City in providing information 
for Thai investors. 
  Mr Sathaphon said the BoI must pay close attention to 
economic changes in Vietnam because with the lifting of the 
embargo trade and investment in the region would expand. 
  Thailand should not worry about effects on Thai investment 
in 
Vietnam in four sectors in which the United States has expertise 
which Thailand cannot match--food products, consumer products, 
services and energy. Thailand should join the U.S. on 
investment projects in energy, he said. Thailand had competed 
for investment with countries such as other ASEAN members and 
China for a long time. Vietnam would be just a new competitor. 
  Vietnam had an advantage in labour costs because in that 
country these are just 10% of total investment outlay, he 
said. 
Raw materials, infrastructure, investment regulations, tax and 
government policy were significant to foreign investors. 
Vietnam wanted a long period to develop its electricity, 
transport and airports. 
  Mr Sathaphon said Thailand must reduce costs and increase 
its 
skilled workforce to attract foreign investors. Thailand must 
speed up development of infrastructure in remote areas. 
However, Thailand's strategy was to develop supporting 
industries which were small or medium-scale looking towards high 
technology. Vietnam needed a long time to develop its industry. 
  Mr Sathaphon said the establishment of "Zone 4" in Thailand 
might increase the competitiveness of this country's remote 
areas. 
  The BoI has agreed in principle to set up zone 4 in horder 
areas such as in the growth triangle. If the Government has a 
clear policy on zone 4, the Finance Ministry, Commerce Ministry 
and the BoI will cooperate to consider the details which cover 
complicated aspects such as tax systems and quotas. 
  Mr Sathaphon said the BoI would join the Vietnamese 
Government in holding a seminar on investment prospects in 
Vietnam. More than 50 Thai businessmen were expected to attend 
the session in March. The seminar will give Thai investors a 
chance to meet state enterprise representatives from Vietnam for 
talks on joint ventures. 
  Mr Chuan is scheduled to visit Vietnam in March. 
  Thais can invest in Vietnam in many areas such as mining 
consumer products, light industries and agriculture, most of 
them under state enterprises the Vietnamese Government wants to 
privatise. Thailand has prospects of exporting spare parts and 
construction materials to Vietnam which aims to double its Gross 
Domestic Product by 2010. 
  The Vietnamese Government's development plan for the next 
six 
years envisages spending about US$40 billion, made up of $12-13 
billion from foreign investment, $7-8 billion from domestic 
sources and $20 billion from foreign loans. 
  The BoI reported that 119 foreign investment projects in 
Vietnam in 1993 comprised 15.35% of total investment. 
Taiwan 
ranked first with 32 projects or 26.9% of the total 
foreign 
investment. Thailand was fifth with eight projects and 
6.72% of 
the total investment.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday 
emphasised that Taiwan's President Li Teng-hui would be paying a 
private visit to Thailand that carried no official endorsement 
from the Government. President Li, who was reported to have 
left the Philippines for Indonesia yesterday, is expected to 
arrive in Thailand on Monday on the last leg of a regional tour 
that Beijing strongly opposes. 
  Squadron Leader Prasong said the Taiwanese president 
arranged 
the trip to Thailand through the private sector and that there 
were no plans for him to meet Prime Minister Chuan Likphai or 
other Cabinet ministers. The Foreign Minister reaffirmed 
Bangkok's one-China policy but he pointed out that this did not 
exclude economic relations. Thailand and Taiwan are co-members 
of the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong made the points after meeting China's 
Ambassador-designate Jing Guihua, who made a second trip to the 
Foreign Ministry yesterday, to make sure that the Foreign 
Minister had received Peking's protest note. 
  The envoy had delivered Peking's protest to Permanent 
Secretary for Foreign Affairs Pracha Khunakasem on Tuesday, when 
the Foreign Minister was absent. 
  The envoy presented his credentials to His Majesty the King 
yesterday afternoon, after meeting Sqn Ldr Prasong. 
  "I informed him [the Chinese envoy] that the Thai Government 
did not issue the invitation, and that the Foreign Ministry had 
received no communication on the matter," Sqn Ldr Prasong sald. 
  "They [the Taiwanese] contacted the private sector," he 
said. 
Thailand broke off diplomatic relations with Taiwan when it 
normalised relations with China on July 1, 1975. 
  "We respect the agreement and we have a one-China policy," 
Sqn Ldr Prasong said. Thailand did not intervene in the 
political problems between China and Taiwan which were "their 
internal affair". But economic relations were a different 
matter, especially when Thailand and Taiwan were co-members of 
APEC. Exchanges of visits for talks on economics and trade were 
"possible". 
  China is also a member of the 15-nation grouping, which 
rallies all six member states of the Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations (ASEAN) and their main trading partners. In a 
statement issued on Monday, Beijing warned regional states of 
possible damage to "friendly relations" between them and China 
if they endorse "in whatever name or form" Mr Li's visits. 
  Taiwan is a major investor in the region. According to 
informed sources, the Taiwanese president is accompanied by 
First Lady Cheng Wen-hui. Foreign Minister Fredrick Chien, 
economic planning agency chief Vincent Siew, deputy secretary to 
the president Tai Jui-ming and Nationalist Party 
secretary-general Hsu Hsui-teh. 
  Chinese President and Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin is 
reported to be planning visits to Thailand and other ASEAN 
member states in the second half of this year.

  [Text] Navigation channel along the upper Mekong River has 
been found to be suitable to be open to commercial navigation. 
The four-nation working party recently surveyed the new 
navigation route along the upper Mekong River slated to be open 
for cargo and passenger ships. The working party studying the 
feasibility of navigation said the new route is suitable from a 
southern town in China through Myanmar [Burma] and Laos to 
Chiang Saen and Chiang Khong Districts in Chiang Rai Province. 
  Director General of the Department of Engery Affairs Prathet 
Sutabut said the opening of the new navigation route will 
benefit the four countries in communications, transportation, 
and tourism. The new project is part the Quadrangle Economic 
Cooperation Plan among Thailand, Laos, Myanmar [Burma], and

  [Text] Thailand and Indonesia this week signed an 
agricultural cooperation at a ceremony in Bangkok. Minister of 
Agriculture and Cooperatives Niphon Phromphan said that the 
signing ceremony followed by bilateral talks between Thailand 
and Indonesia on agricultural cooperation held for the first 
time in Jakarta, Indonesia, in February 1993. [sentence as 
heard] Minister Niphon said cooperation included vegetation, 
livestock, and fishery. As a result, business people of 
Thailand and Indonesia have set up joint ventures in poultry 
farm, feed stock industry, and deep sea fishery. 
  The minister said that the second meeting in Thailand 
emphasized on attracting the private sectors from both countries 
to invest in agricultural production and agroindustrial

  [Text] Foreign ministers of the Nonaligned Movement [NAM] 
today started discussions on realizing the NAM's efforts to 
overcome international political and economic problems. The 
consultative meeting of a number of NAM foreign ministers under 
way at the Department of Foreign Affairs in Jakarta will end 
tomorrow. 
  Opening the meeting this morning, Foreign Minister Ali 
Alatas 
said efforts to end Serbian brutalities and to enhance 
cooperation between the NAM and the Group of 77 are among the 
pressing issues that need to be tackled. Indonesia reiterated 
the need for an immediate lifting of the arms embargo on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the convening of an international 
conference on Bosnia. The lifting of the arms embargo will 
motivate the Serbs to honor various UN resolutions and end their 
indiscriminate acts against the Bosnians. 
  The NAM members also need to continue paying attention to 
the 
debts of developing nations. He reminded the NAM and the Group 
of 77 to continue coordinating and consolidating their economic 
activities. 
  The consultative meeting attended by 21 NAM members, 
including Indonesia is expected to overcome the problems in 
preparation for a NAM ministerial meeting to be held in Cairo, 
Egypt in early June.

  [Text] Jakarta, Feb. 9 (ANTARA) -- Foreign Minister Ali 
Alatas on Wednesday the UN decision to create "safe areas" in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina must be enforced to deter further attacks and 
ensure the flow of humanitarian aid to the war-torn region. 
Action should now be taken against Serbian forces in the event 
that they attack the safe areas or block humanitarian and aid 
operations," he said at the key-note address of the consultative 
meeting of Nonaligned Movement (NAM) foreign ministers. 
  Alatas said the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR)'s 
mandate to enforce and establish a unified command structure for 
all troops in Bosnia should be more effective. He also stressed 
the need to launch air strikes against Serbian forces and stop 
its arms supply. 
  "The air strikes against Serbian forces and an interdiction 
of arms supplies to their units in Bosnia must now be put into 
effect," Alatas said, adding that the arms embargo on Bosnia 
should be lifted to rectify the acute imbalance of armaments in 
the field and to motivate the Serbs to come to the negotiating 
table. "Our current efforts on Bosnia are focused on these 
endeavours and on the feasibility of convening an international 
meeting on Bosnia." 
  The minister also expressed concern over the crisis in 
countries such as Somalia and in the Middle East. He said the 
current situation in Somalia was complicated by the intended 
pullout of American, French, Italian, and Turkish troops that 
once made up the UN peacekeeping forces in the country. 
  In addition, he also mentioned that Israel had not yet 
fulfilled the December 13 date to withdraw from designated areas 
as stipulated by the peace accord it signed with the PLO last 
September. 
  "Further aggravating the situation is the persistence of 
oppressive Israeli policies and practices in the occupied 
territories and the inflexibility shown in its negotiations 
which cannot but have broader ramifications," he said. 
  In his speech, Alatas said he hoped to see the Joint 
Coordinating Committee (JCC) establisted by NAM and the Group of 
77 (G-77) begin its operations this year. 
  "For this purpose, an ad-hoc working group comprising of 
members of NAM and G-77 will be established to formulate its 
term of reference," he said. 
  The idea of forming the JCC was first mooted by heads of 
state at the 10th NAM summit in Jakarta two years ago. They had 
all stressed the need to harmonize, consolidate, and whenever 
necessary integrate the economic activities of both NAM and 
G-77. G-77 is a consultative forum for economic affairs of 
developing countries with Egypt as the leader. 
  The JCC is expected to harmonize NAM's action programme for 
economic cooperation and the G-77's Caracas Program of Action 
(CPA). 
  "When the JCC starts operating, we can expect South-South 
cooperation to be more focused and more efficient as it brings 
about the harmonization of APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation] and CPA programs," said Alatas. 
  The two-day NAM ministerial consultative meeting was 
attended 
by foreign ministers and representatives of 22 member countries.

  [Text] Jakarta, Feb 9 (ANTARA) -- The Nonaligned Movement 
(NAM) will explore the possibilities of the United Nations 
convening a special session on Bosnia-Herzegovina if current 
efforts to establish peace in the area prove fruitless, Foreign 
Minister Ali Alatas said Wednesday. The idea of calling for a 
special UN session was approved by a NAM foreign ministers 
conference currently underway here, Alatas told newsmen. 
  Participants of the NAM ministerial meeting requested 
Indonesia as NAM chairman to propose to the movement's 
coordinating bureau in New York to meet with the purpose amongst 
others to explore the possibilities of having the United Nations 
organize a special session on Bosnia-Herzegovina, he said. A 
special UN session was a last resort in case the UN Security 
Council proved unable to implement the resolutions it had itself 
issued, Alatas said. 
  The NAM foreign ministers also asked the five Nonaligned 
countries that are currently member of the UN Security Council 
to urge the council to carry out its resolutions. 
  "If the UN Security Council cannot execute its own 
resolutions we will, through our coordinating bureau in New 
York, call for a special UN session on Bosnia", Alatas said. 
  He said non-implementation of the UN Security Council's 
resolutions -- such as on establishment of safe areas and 
limited air strikes against Serb forces in Bosnia, was caused by 
reluctance on the part of a number of council members. A 
special UN session, according to Alatas, could authorize a 
number of member countries to settle a conflict such as had 
happened in the case of the Korean war. In such a special UN 
session a decision could be reached by voting while the veto 
right of UN Security Council members did not apply. 
  "We hope that in this manner the slaughter in the region can 
finally be ended," he said. 
  The NAM Foreign ministers also supported the idea to stage 
an 
international conference on Bosnia-Herzegovina as proposed not 
long ago by the Organization of the Islamic Concerence (OIC), 
Alatas said. 
  They called on the NAM chairman to propose to the movement's 
coordinating bureau in New York to examine the possibilites of 
undertaking such an international conference since the London 
conference on Bosnia had yet to produce any decision capable of 
halting the war. Alatas said the principles of the London 
conference's resolutions had remained unimplemented. "It is 
therefore time to settle the conflict in Bosnia in a just and 
comprehensive way," he said. 
  The ministers at their meeting here also called for the 
lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to 
bring about a military balance and press Serbia into returning 
to the conference table, Alatas said. 
  Opened by Alatas Wednesday, the NAM foreign ministers 
meeting 
here is being attended by 22 countries and will discuss a number 
of topics in preparation of a NAM ministerial meeting due to 
take place in Egypt next June. 
  On the meeting's opening day Indonesia as NAM chairman 
briefed participating countries on various progammes of 
activities that had been implemented and those yet to be carried 
out.

  [Text] Jakarta, Feb 10 (ANTARA) -- President Suharto in his 
capacity as the chairman of the Nonaligned Movement (NAM) said 
that there has been a change in the pattern of approach to 
implement the North-South cooperation. 
  "Today, the partnership spirit has become the new pattern of 
the North-South cooperation," said the head of state when 
receiving 21 representatives of NAM members here on Thursday. 
  Foreign Minister Ali Alatas quoted President Suharto as 
saying that the North-South cooperation should be implemented on 
the basis of mutual interest and inter-dependency spirit. The 
president said that some resolutions and agreements reached by 
NAM members at the Jakarta's 10th NAM summit 17 months ago in 
the sectors of debt management, population, food etc have been 
implemented. 
  Suharto said he had discussed with leaders of the Group of 
Seven (G-7) industrialized countries debt burden issues 
involving 50 NAM members, 18 of which are classified as the 
poorest countries with the slowest GNP. The G-7 groups the US, 
Japan, Britain, Canada, Germany, France and Italy. The leaders 
of the G-7 have admitted the important roles played by the 
108-member movement in settling the debt burden, Alatas quoted 
President Suharto as saying. 
  Stating that the NAM will always strive to put more emphasis 
on such an economic issue, the head of state said that Indonesia 
is ready to share its experiences with other members in managing 
the debt. 
  "We made an effort to soften the debt burden faced by 
countries having the lowest revenue. It could be the 
re-scheduling of the debt payment," he added. 
  On the Bosnian issue, the head of state has expressed his 
strong support for the establishment of an international 
conference on Bosnia. 
  For this aims, the chairman of the NAM will give inputs to 
the NAM coordinating bureau in the U.N. to follow up their 
planned international conference. 
  Minister Alatas said that he could understand if there are 
some groups of people who have expressed dissatisfaction towards 
Indonesia's inability to send its troops to Bosnia. He said 
that the sending of the troops would never settle the problem. 
  "It would only be worsening the condition," he said, adding 
that the key to the settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue 
is to implement the U.N resolutions and abide by the 
international law. 
  Alatas strongly asked the Serbian and Croatian forces to 
stop 
the aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina, saying "If necessary, 
the U.N may use the arms force to stop it."
