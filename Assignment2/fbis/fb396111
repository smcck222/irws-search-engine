<F P=106> [Interview with Chong Chong-uk, senior secretary for Foreign </F>
and National Security Affairs of the Presidential Secretariat, 
by unidentified presidential office reporters at Chongwadae on 
16 February] 
  [Text] [Reporter] What is the content and scope of the 
facilities to which North Korea has decided to accept 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection? 
  [Chong Chong-uk] Apart from the five facilities, 
including the eight megawatt-class atomic reactor; critical 
reactor [imgyero]; semi-critical reactor [chunimgyero]; the 
plant producing nuclear fuel rods; and the storehouse for 
nuclear fuel rods that have received regular [chonggi] 
inspection; and two other facilities, including the five 
megawatt atomic reactor and the radio-chemistry laboratory, 
which have aroused doubts concerning it being a nuclear 
reprocessing facility by Western countries, are to be inspected. 
In particular, an agreement for supplementing inspection of 
each facility will be concluded for the two facilities that did 
not receive regular inspection. 
  [Reporter] How do you assess the North's acceptance of the 
nuclear inspection? 
  [Chong] It is fortunate that North Korea made such a 
decision. If an agreement for inspection had not been reached, 
North Korea's nuclear issue would have been handed over to the 
UN Security Council. Also, regardless of our side's position to 
continue dialogue, the situation would have moved toward 
sanctions against North Korea. It is fortunate that the 
possibility of handing over North Korea's nuclear issue to the 
UN Security Council has been eliminated. However, this does not 
mean that nuclear transparency will be guaranteed through the 
upcoming inspection. 
  [Reporter] What are the remaining problems? 
  [Chong] Working-level contacts for the exchange of 
special envoys will take place with the inspection team's visit 
to the North. Through the inspections, the continuity of 
safeguards that the facilities had not been transformed for 
military use should be proven and working-level contacts should 
successfully develop so meaningful dialogue can be exchanged. 
After that, the rest of the problems, including the guarantee 
of transparency of undeclared facilities, will be discussed at 
the third round of the U.S.-North Korea talks. 
  [Reporter] Do you think the acceptance of inspection 
constitutes a great sea change in North Korea's external policy? 
  [Chong] I think it is neither a great sea change nor a 
minor change. There are still many problems and obstacles that 
we have to overcome. Nevertheless, I think a meaningful 
breakthrough has been made for the resolution of the nuclear 
issue. We have avoided the stage of sanctions and the special 
envoy exchange between South and North Korea is now possible. 
The scope of dialogue is wide open. 
  [Reporter] What do you think North Korea has gained by 
accepting inspection? 
  [Chong] It has avoided being referred to the UN Security 
Council. I think the policy was adjusted on the occasion of Kim 
Chong-il's birthday. (On this point, other Chongwadae 
authorities feel it is because North Korea could not explain to 
its people that international sanctions were imposed on Kim 
Il-song, the hero of the chuche idea, of which North Korea was 
most afraid). 
  [Reporter] What will happen to the Team Spirit exercise? 
  [Chong] The question of its suspension will be decided in 
connection with the IAEA nuclear inspection and the discussion 
between South and North Korea regarding the exchange of special 
envoys. The timing of the announcement could be somehow 
different. 
  [Reporter] What is the president's opinion? 
  [Chong] The talks between the IAEA and North Korea began 
at 6 pm in Vienna on 15 February. More than one round of talks 
were held. The president received continuous reports in the 
evening and early morning. The president has thoroughly and 
concretely taken care of the nuclear issue. 
  [Reporter] Did Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's activities 
during his U.S. visit help the resolution of the issue? 
  [Chong] It was very timely. Judging that the rumor of 
the emergency situation on the Korean peninsula was agitating 
North Korea, the president had the foreign minister visit the 
United States on 9 February, earlier than the 13 February 
original schedule. Minister Han's persuasion of U.S. 
journalists and coordination of positions with high-ranking 
policymakers was very helpful. 
  [Reporter] Kim Il-song reportedly proposed a meeting with 
President Clinton through Reverend Billy Graham, who recently 
visited the North. 
  [Chong] We are well aware of the contents through close 
consultation with the United States. The reports are not 
exactly true. I cannot reveal further. 
  [Reporter] What do you think of the visit to North Korea by 
Representative Ronald Dellums, chairman of the U.S. House Armed 
Services Committee? 
  [Chong] He received the invitation from North Korea last 
year. He may convey a verbal message from President Clinton, but 
there will be no personal letter as far as I know. He is not a 
government official so he will not negotiate, but will convey 
the existing U.S. position. 
  [Reporter] Were there any signs that North Korea would 
accept nuclear inspections? 
  [Chong] The remarks by a spokesman of North Korean 
Foreign Ministry last week said the nuclear issue would be 
resolved through dialogue. From that point we could interpret 
that the previous stance on inspections would be changed. In 
addition, there had been indirect communication between the 
United States and North Korea, and the IAEA and North Korea, 
although I cannot give further details.

<F P=106> [By So Chae-kyu] </F>
  [Text] Washington, Feb. 16 (YONHAP) -- Most "Korea 
watchers" here, noting the latest developments in the North 
Korean nuclear dispute, say it should not be viewed simply as a 
tug-of-war between Washington and Pyongyang but as part of an 
overall U.S. strategy for the Asia-Pacific region. In other 
words, those laboring under the impression that the United 
States is being intimidated by North Korea are making the 
mistake of looking at the trees but not the forest, they say. 
They also argue that it is wrong to assume that President Bill 
Clinton's administration is unable to forge a consistent policy 
on North Korea as it is busy looking over its shoulder at the 
hawks in the Defense Ministry and the Central Intelligence 
Agency. The White House may even be trying to give that 
appearance, they say. 
  In a nutshell, the White House is attempting to maintain and 
protect its controlling position not only on the Korean 
peninsula but also in the whole of Asia by playing "the North 
Korea card" to the fullest, they say. 
  One has to keep in mind, they advise, that the North Korean 
nuclear issue has been dragged out since Washington's interest 
in the region and Pyongyang's urgent need for improved relations 
with America have meshed nicely. Of course, unexpected events 
and the interests of China and Japan tended to complicate the 
issue, but in the end, the compromise worked out by Washington 
and Pyongyang appears to have gone as planned by both sides. 
Banking on its anxiety, South Korea could have been made to 
play the game, probably unwittingly, by the White House, some 
analysts say. 
  Certain diplomatic sources in Washington question how 
accurately the South Korean Government has been "reading the 
minds" of President Clinton and his staff at the White House. 
As one example of Seoul's inability to divine the White House's 
intentions, the sources cite the aborted visit to North Korea by 
Rep. Ronald Dellums. 
  Even after Dellums' scheduled trip to Pyongyang was 
announced, South Korean Foreign Ministry officials were said to 
be skeptical of the visit ever coming off. They reportedly 
wondered: Would it be necessary when North Korea had already 
accepted outside inspection of its nuclear facilities? 
  Some South Korean officials were even said to be betting on 
Dellums' visit being cancelled, which has indeed happened. In 
any event, it wasn't for nothing that North Korea singled out 
Dellums, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and "an 
influential dove" in the U.S. Congress, and invited him to visit 
Pyongyang at this crucial juncture, they say. The White House 
says Dellums' planned visit had nothing to do with the U.S. 
Government, but no one in Washington would take this statement 
seriously, the analysts say. 
  One American Korea watcher said North Korea has "earned" a 
one-year lease on life by agreeing to allow the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to inspect its facilities. It is 
thus time for South Korea to be really alert and pursue policy 
bearing its own interests in mind, they say.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 17 (YONHAP) -- The government will 
announce a conditional suspension of this year's "Team Spirit" 
military exercise with the United States next week when an 
outside nuclear inspection team arrives in North Korea, while 
seeking to resume low-level dialogue with Pyongyang on an 
exchange of special envoys, officials said Thursday. 
  At the same time, North Korea and the United States will 
announce plans for a third round of high-level talks on 
improving bilateral relations. 
  The government's announcement on Team Spirit will state that 
the joint South Korea-U.S. field maneuvers would be suspended 
if the International Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] inspections 
of North Korean nuclear sites and the working-level inter-Korean 
dialogue proceeded smoothly, according to the officials. 
  These were among the topics discussed Thursday at two 
meetings of unification-related ministers on inter-Korean 
relations after Pyongyang's decision Wednesday to permit IAEA 
inspections. One meeting was presided over by Unification 
Minister Yi Yong-tok and the other by Prime Minister Yi 
Hoe-chang. 
  The U.S. announcement on plans for a third round of 
high-level talks with North Korea will contain the same 
conditions as those in the South Korean statement on Team 
Spirit's suspension, the officials said. 
  The government will seek to exchange special envoys with 
North Korea next month, with an eye to solving the North Korean 
nuclear issue initially and then to implementing the basic 
North-South agreement and arranging reunions for separated 
families. But the government will prepare for the possibility 
that North Korea might hinder the IAEA inspections or stall on 
resuming inter-Korean dialogue to buy time for its nuclear arms 
program, the officials said. 
  Seoul and Washington both maintain that an exchange of 
special envoys between North and South Korea must take place 
before the next high-level North Korea-U.S. talks, they added. 
There will be no other form of inter-Korean contact but the 
exchange of special envoys, an official said. 
  Another official said, however, it was unlikely that the 
initial exchange of visits by the two Koreas' special envoys 
would precede the high-level North Korea-U.S. talks, adding 
that a visit by one side to the other could meet the condition 
for resuming high-level discussions between Washington and 
Pyongyang.

<F P=106> [By Ha Chun-u: "The MND's (Ministry of National Defense) </F>
Reaction to North Korea's Acceptance of Nuclear Inspections"] 
  [Text] With North Korea's acceptance of nuclear 
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], 
attention is now focused on whether the ROK and U.S. Governments 
will suspend the Team Spirit exercise since North Korea has 
demanded the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise as a 
precondition for the settlement of the nuclear matter. 
  Regarding this, the ROK Defense Ministry, the department in 
charge of the exercise, is taking a prudent attitude. 
  The Team Spirit exercise is a large-scale military mobile 
exercise that has been staged every year since 1976 and has 
played a major role in weakening North Korea's will for war. 
Ever since the United States won the Gulf war by mobilizing 
ultramodern weapons, North Korea bears in mind that the odds are 
in favor of the United States in case a war breaks out on the 
Korean peninsula. Furthermore, North Korea, terming the Team 
Spirit exercise as a war exercise for northward invasion, is 
learned to have been greatly menaced by the exercise, and 
assumed emergency alert posture while the annual exercise was 
conducted. 
  Such being the case, the MND maintains that the question on 
calling off the exercise is certain to be an effective 
bargaining chip for resolution of the nuclear issue. 
  The MND assumes a stance that North Korea's acceptance of 
nuclear inspection cannot be seen as the resolution of the 
nuclear issue but, at best, a return to the situation before it 
announced its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty. Its reason is that there are other problems that need 
to be solved, including the inspection of undeclared sites, to 
prove its nonpossession of nuclear weapons. In a nutshell, the 
MND thinks the time is not ripe to discuss the issue at the 
present stage, 
  The MND sees that the suspension of this year's Team Spirit 
can only be discussed when IAEA inspections are actually carried 
out in North Korea and the exchange of North-South special 
envoys gets good results. 
  Only when these demands are met, the MND maintains, should 
there be the ROK-U.S. joint announcement on the suspension of 
the Team Spirit exercise, along with the agenda for the third 
round of North Korea-U.S. talks. 
  The MND has also made clear that an expression of the will 
to 
suspend the exercise does not correspond to the suspension of 
the exercise. This means that it will announce the skipping of 
this year's exercise only when tangible achievements are seen in 
IAEA nuclear inspections and the exchange of special envoys. 
  Judging that IAEA inspection will take at least two weeks. 
The MND notes that if North Korea shows a sincerity in 
negotiations for North-South mutual nuclear inspections and the 
third round of high-level talks with the United States during 
this period, it may announce the suspension of this year's 
exercise. 
  Before the final decision is made, chances are high that its 
intention to call off Team Spirit may be expressed through a 
government-level channel toward the end of February or early 
March, however, this is eligible to change during the 
negotiating process with the North. 
  Taking into account that North Korea has employed a 
foot-dragging tactic in negotiating inspection-related issues 
until now, the MND predicts that North Korea is much likely to 
express its intention to receive nuclear inspections before the 
IAEA Board of Governors' Meeting slated for 21 February for the 
moment and then delay inspections of undeclared sites to the 
extent that Team Spirit cannot be conducted. This is what the 
MND is concerned about. 
  In this perspective, the MND position is that the question 
on 
whether to cancel the exercise or not is effective in resolving 
the North Korean nuclear issue and that it should be used as a 
final bargaining chip to the maximum until North Korea clears 
its attitude. 
  It was learned that the MND is discussing with the United 
States whether or not the ROK may make the final decision on 
suspending or conducting the Team Spirit exercise, at least this 
year, instead of sharing the decision with the United States.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 17 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the 
United States plan to announce the dates of the next North 
Korea-U.S. high-level talks and suspension of the joint military 
exercise "Team Spirit" as early as next week, a Foreign Ministry 
official said Thursday. The announcement will be made around 
the time an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection 
team arrives in North Korea, according to the official. But the 
announcement will carry conditions -- that North Korea allow 
unrestricted IAEA inspections as agreed this week, and that 
Seoul and Pyongyang reopen dialogue, he said. 
  Unification-related ministers met Thursday morning and 
discussed necessary action following the North Korea-IAEA 
agreement on nuclear inspections. 
  Pyongyang is demanding that Seoul and Washington suspend 
Team 
Spirit and schedule the next North Korea-U.S. high-level talks 
simultaneously with the arrival of the IAEA inspection team, the 
ministry official said. This would constitute the "small 
package deal" between Pyongyang and Washington. 
  North Korea has yet to notify the IAEA of the entry date and 
schedule for the inspection team, but Seoul expects the IAEA 
delegation to arrive in Pyongyang late this week and begin work 
next week. Inter-Korean dialogue is likely to resume next week 
as well, the official predicted. The resumption would be in the 
form of previous working-level contacts for the exchange of 
presidential envoys. He said the announcement on Team Spirit 
and North Korea-U.S. high-level talks would come around that 
time. 
  "But it will be a conditional announcement," said the 
official. North Korea would have to meet the necessary 
prerequisites in order for the high-level contact to take place 
and for Team Spirit to be canceled. Speculation has it that the 
date of the high-level contact would be sometime in mid-March, 
since the IAEA inspection team needs two to three weeks in North 
Korea and another few weeks to file a report.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 17 (YONHAP) -- Inter-Korean economic 
cooperation is expected to become revitalized soon due to 
Pyongyang's acceptance of inspections by the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Trade, Industry and Energy 
Ministry said Thursday. 
  The ministry plans to change the current indirect trade with 
the North to direct trade as well as encourage South Korean 
enterprises to invest in North Korea if the nuclear problem is 
cleared up. An official at the ministry said, however, that 
economic cooperation will have to start with projects which need 
little capital, low-level technology and a short start-up period 
because of the difficulty in predicting North Korean policy. 
  Even though the nuclear problem is nearing resolution, 
follow-up measures to improve inter-Korean relations including 
exchanges of special envoys will not necessarily be taken by 
North Korea, according to the official. The ministry thus plans 
to sell light industry goods first, which can contribute to an 
improvement of living conditions among North Koreans. 
  In the event that full-fledged investment in North Korea was 
realized, initial projects would focus on joint production of 
light industry goods including footwear, shirts and blouses, on 
which Daewoo Group Chairman Kim U-chung reached agreement when 
he visited Pyongyang in 1991. 
  Kim agreed to undertake construction of plants to 
manufacture 
nine items, including a knitting mill capable of producing up to 
2.4 million knitted goods a year. 
  A ministry official said, "The most difficult project to 
push 
ahead with is development of Kumkang Mountain, which Hyundai's 
Honorary Chairman Chong Chu-yong agreed to push during his visit 
to North Korea, because it requires much capital and a long time 
to complete." 
  Meanwhile, if the government allows businessmen to travel to 
North Korea, many are expected to visit for discussions on 
direct trade and investment. More than 40 businesses have 
already received invitations from North Korea or submitted 
applications for visits to the National Unification Board (NUB).

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 17 (YONHAP) -- The government is 
pushing to conclude an industrial cooperation agreement with 
China in a bid to strengthen economic links when President Kim 
Yong-sam visits Beijing in March, Trade, Industry and Energy 
Ministry officials said on Thursday. The government is also 
forging comprehensive measures for economic advancement into 
China, including expansion of trade, promotion of investment and 
strengthening of industrial cooperation. 
  During the president's visit, the first joint committee for 
industrial cooperation will meet to discuss the fundamental 
principles of industrial cooperation and ways to push ahead with 
priority cooperation projects, according to the Ministry. 
  The top projects will include automobiles, airplanes, time 
division exchange (TDX), a type of electronic telephone 
exchange, and technology market plans, Ministry officials said. 
  The government will also increase financial support for the 
deferred payment export fund of the Export-Import Bank of Korea, 
designed to aid export businesses here, and ease conditions of 
such support to expand bilateral trade with China. 
  Within this year, the Ministry will designate the types of 
industries which can benefit from the government's financial and 
administrative support when they invest in China, officials said. 
  The Ministry is also studying establishment of trade offices 
in the Chinese cities of Dalian and Chongqing in addition to the 
current offices in Beijing and Shanghai, as well as prudent 
management of the adjustment tariff and anti-dumping tariff 
systems to remove possible sources of trade friction. 
  South Korea's exports to China increased 165 percent in 1992 
and 90 percent last year, and China has become an important 
trade partner. 
  China is now attracting the most South Korean investment, 
recording 1 billion U.S. dollars as of last year's end, 
officials said.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 16 (YONHAP) -- Youthful South Korean 
office workers give 61 marks out of 100 to the Kim Yong-sam 
government, a recent opinion survey showed on Wednesday. A poll 
taken by the Kwangjang Communications Co. indicated that 48.6 
percent of the pollees gave the stabilization of real estate 
prices as the most important task facing the country. 
  Those who said the eradication of corruption and 
irregularities are the most urgent accounted for 31.8 percent of 
the total while 29.7 percent gave economic development as the 
most exigent task. 
  The opinion survey, made in a contract awarded by the 
Citizens Coalition for Economic Justice, was conducted toward 
721 office workers in the age group of twenties and thirties in 
Jan. 18-26. 
  Most of the questioned, 81.8 percent, complained of a high 
tax rate, saying that compared with others, their earned income 
tax rates were too high. 
  The average optimum wage hike suggested by the pollees for 
this year was 14.2 percent. As for reason for the increase, 
91.5 percent cited price spiral and 4.3 percent productivity 
increase. 
  Asked to give the politicians on whom they pin highest 
expectations this year, 31.8 percent named Pak Chan-chong, head 
of the New Political Reform Party: 15.7 percent President Kim 
Yong- sam: 12.6 percent Yi Pu-yong, a sumpre member of the 
Democratic Party: and 7.8 percent Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 17 (YONHAP) -- Chongwadae, the 
presidential office, will send officials at grade three and 
above to private companies so that they can learn about advanced 
business management expertise and conditions in the private 
sector, a Chongwadae official said on Thursday. The move is to 
be taken on President Kim Yong-sam's instruction that public 
servants learn management expertise from the business circles in 
light of the need to increase the nation's competitiveness, the 
official said. 
  Five teams of officials are being sent to the training 
centers of such companies as Samsung, Kolon and Lucky-Goldstar. 
The first eight-member team attended the Samsung Training 
Center in Yongin, Kyonggi Province, on Feb. 14-16. They 
listened to lectures on business survival strategies, new 
administrative skill, and ways to increase competitiveness in 
the world market along with other participants from private 
companies and government bodies. 
  "The lectures' contents seemed somewhat unfamiliar, but they 
were still helpful," an official said.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 17 (YONHAP) -- Chairman Kim Chong-pil of 
the ruling Democratic Liberal Party on Thursday called for 
political reforms and administrative district revisions, saying, 
"This is the time for our politics to seek its proper role in 
the 21st century, sloughing off the practice of sticking to the 
past." 
  Politicians must restore public trust by conducting "moral 
and salutary politics and productive, efficient and high 
value-added politics," he said in a policy speech at the 
National Assembly plenary meeting. 
  Kim stressed the need for both the ruling and opposition 
parties to produce "a mature image of parliament" through policy 
confrontation at all of their meetings. 
  For reform of the electoral system, the election law 
amendments which are being reviewed by the two parties must be 
passed by parliament during its current session, he said. 
  This year, the ruling party will pursue a plan to revise 
administrative districts for improved administrative services to 
the people and successful local autonomy. 
  He said the ruling party would develop a new social welfare 
model suitable to the realities of the country and work to 
prepare a basic social security law based on this model.

  [Text] Asked about the PRC Embassy's protest letter in 
connection with the meeting between Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai 
Wirawan and the Taiwan president, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai 
said that the Taiwan president has the right to come to Thailand 
because he has not been declared persona non grata. The 
government has already explained this issue to China. The prime 
minister noted that the meeting between the Taiwan president and 
Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan was a personal affair. He 
said: 
  [Begin recording] [Chuan] Trade relations between Thailand 
and Taiwan are quite extensive. Taiwan's investment in Thailand 
is fairly high; last year it ranked third behind the Japan and 
the United States. Trade contacts have not been broken. We 
send workers to work in Taiwan. 
  As far as political relations are concerned, you can see 
that 
the Taiwan president did not have any official meetings with 
Thai political leaders. I did not meet with him. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What will our reaction be to 
Taiwan's 
attempt to use this visit for propaganda purposes? 
  [Chuan] It depends on how we treated the visit. The foreign 
minister and I did not have any official meetings with the 
president. This issue should come to an end. [end recording]

  [Text] Speaking to reporters after his meeting with 
Singapore Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar at the Foreign Ministry 
this morning, Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri 
said that his new Singapore counterpart came to see him just to 
get acquainted and their discussion touched on general issues. 
  Asked about the Taiwanese president's recent visit to 
Thailand, the foreign minister said he had earlier pointed out 
that the visit was a personal affair. There was no official 
reception held for Li. He does not believe that the visit will 
have any impact on relations between Thailand and the PRC. 
However, the foreign minister said that Chinese Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen will stop in Thailand on 27 February and he 
will take this opportunity to explain to him about the Taiwanese 
president's visit to Thailand so that China will understand 
Thailand's position. 
  Asked about the report on the extended detention of Burmese 
opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, the foreign minister said he 
knows nothing about this matter, adding that the permission 
granted to a U.S. democratic congressman to meet with Aung San 
Suu Kyi is a good sign because it indicates that the Burmese 
Government has become more open in dealing with all problems. 
However, he noted that the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi is an 
internal affair of Burma. The foreign minister anticipated that 
Burma's political situation will improve since the world is 
paying much attention to it and the Burmese leaders themselves 
are aware of this fact.

  [Text] Aphisit Wetchachiwa, spokesman for the Prime 
Minister's Office, held a news briefing at Government House, 
during which he answered reporters' questions on the PRC's 
protest over Taiwan President Li Teng-hui's visit to Thailand. 
The spokesman said that President Li Teng-hui is not persona 
non grata. Besides, his visit to Thailand was a private visit; 
he was not even the guest of the Thai private sector. There is 
no reason at all for Thailand to prevent President Li Teng-hui 
from visiting the country. 
  Concerning Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan's meeting 
with President Li Teng-hui when he visited Thailand, the 
spokesman said the meeting was private. Regarding the luncheon 
hosted by House of Representatives Speaker Marut Bunnak for 
President Li Teng-hui, the spokesman said it was a parliamentary 
affair and the government had no business interfering with it. 
  The spokesman for the Prime Minister's Office reiterated 
that 
Thailand is a free country, and anyone who is not persona non 
grata can visit. The government, meanwhile, has reaffirmed its 
one China stance, and hopes that the PRC does not become too 
worried about the issue. The spokesman said he believes the 
Foreign Ministry will be able to make China understand this.

  [Text] A House Foreign Affairs Committee member yesterday 
claimed that Taiwanese President Li Teng-hui's "private holiday" 
to Thailand would only benefit a certain political party. 
Kuthep Saikrachang, the deputy House committee spokesman, made 
the comment to Parliament reporters but refused to identify the 
party. He said that during the last general election campaign, 
a rumour was spread nationwide that some countries could "buy" 
Thailand through some political parties that have spent "huge" 
sums of money to win elections. 
  Mr Kuthep who is also Phalang Tham MP for Si Sa Ket, said he 
did not know if Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri, deputy leader 
of the PDP, was told in advance of the Taiwanese leader's trip. 
He also denied that PDP members have vested Interests in Taiwan. 
  Other House committee members also questioned why some New 
Aspiration Party MPs and executives were seen at the dinner 
meeting hosted on Valentine's Day at the Pacific Island Resort 
Hotel in Phuket. 
  The NAP's Labour and Social Welfare Minister Phaithun 
Kaeothong led a Thai delegation consisting of MPs and job 
placement agency owners to Taiwan last year to seek more work 
positions on the island nation for Thai workers. 
  Mr Kuthep told the press that the House committee would next 
Wednesday invite Deputy Premier Amnuai Wirawan, Sqn Ldr Prasong, 
and Mr Phaithun to give testimony about their alleged 
involvement with the Taiwanese delegation. 
  Mr Amnuai was present at the party at the Pacific Island 
Resort Hotel in Phuket while Mr Phaithun has denied that he 
attended the meeting. The House committee deputy spokesman said 
the Taiwanese leader's trip has prompted China's House Foreign 
Committee to postpone its trip to Thailand from February 23 to 
March 1. The postponement was seen by the Thai House committee 
as a protest by the Chinese delegation. Mr Kuthep insisted that 
his House committee would again invite the Chinese delegation to 
visit the kingdom.

  [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Dr. Surin Phitsuwan held a 
briefing on 16 February to describe his meeting with U.S. 
Representative William Richardson, a Democrat from New Mexico, 
who called on him at the Foreign Ministry. The latter detailed 
his 14-15 February visit to Burma, authorized by the Burmese 
Government, to meet with Burmese leader General Khin Nyunt and 
opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. 
  Minister Surin said the new development reflects U.S. 
interest in Burma and the importance it attaches to diplomatic 
contacts with Burma. It also reflects the same concern that 
ASEAN feels for Burma. The deputy foreign minister said 
Representative William Richardson expressed his satisfaction 
that there is greater access to the Burmese leader and to Aung 
San Suu Kyi as a result of the constructive engagement policy. 
  Mr. William Richardson also wants Thailand to help promote 
unity in Burma in the areas of politics, narcotics, and human 
rights, and stressed Thailand's role with regards to the Burmese 
refugees at the common border with Burma. He said that 
Thailand, as Burma's neighbor, is in a good position to help 
Burma solve these problems. The deputy foreign minister said 
Thailand would do as much as it could to help Burma and provide 
the facilities that it needs.

  [Text] According to Oranut Osathanon, director of the 
Foreign Trade Department, the latest development in the 
negotiations between Thailand and the United States on extension 
of the textile quota which expired on 31 December is that the 
Thai side has asked for a new round of negotiations on 21-22 
February in the United States. The United States has not 
responded yet. 
  Earlier negotiations failed to reach agreement because the 
U.S. side wanted to include punitive action against countries it 
found to have exceeded quotas by using quotas of third countries 
by immediate reduction of the offending countries' quotas. If 
the quota violation is large, the reduction would be threefold. 
The Thai side felt the punishment to be unfair. It also sought 
quota enlargement and thus refused to sign an accord. The Thai 
side has been trying to organize other ASEAN countries to 
enhance its bargaining power. 
  Oranut said the fact that the Philippines accepted the U.S. 
conditions and signed an accord early last month could make it 
more difficult for Thailand to negotiate quota enlargement and 
punitive clauses. In any event, the accord reached between the 
United States and the Philippines will be studied to aid 
Thailand's negotiation position. 
  Oranut said an alternative is to not sign a quota accord, 
the 
course which Thailand chose three years ago.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] On 16 February the Bangkok newspapers 
THAI RAT and KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT publish editorials commenting on 
the trade conflict between Japan and United States and the 
possible impact on Thailand. 
  THAI RAT's 450-word editorial, on page 3, titled: "Keep a 
Close Watch on Japan," says it is necessary for "the Thai 
Government and the private sector to closely monitor 
developments following the collapse of the U.S.-Japan trade 
talks last week because they can have `considerable' impact on 
the Thai economy in general." 
  The editorial says that the failure of the negotiations has 
caused the yen's appreciation against the U.S. dollar. 
"Consequently, Thailand is affected immediately in two ways. 
First, it will have to pay more for raw materials and 
semi-finished products imported from Japan. Second, the 
exchange rate of the baht will rise and thus affect Thailand's 
competitiveness in the international market." 
  The paper cites reports on Japan's move to open its market 
for hundreds of countries with which it has been developing 
trade surpluses in an attempt to prevent them from being 
exploited by the United States. "We must closely monitor all 
developments so that we can figure out what goods we can sell in 
their market. Meanwhile, we must make the necessary 
preparations to cope with the relocation of Japanese factories 
to other countries. We have to attract them to our country." 
  "Labor costs in Thailand might be higher than those in 
China, 
Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Burma, but that is not a problem 
since labor forms only 22 percent of total production cost. We 
have an open money market and telecommunications network that is 
far superior to those of many other countries. If the state and 
private sectors join hands, we will gain substantially." 
  KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT's 400-word editorial, on page 2, titled: 
"Beware, We Might Get It," cites reports from foreign news 
agencies on U.S. President Clinton's pledge to impose sactions 
against Japan in retaliation for the latter's refusal to 
cooperate in solving the problem of the U.S. trade deficit. The 
first retaliatory measure to be used by the United States is the 
closure of its cellular phone markets. The editorial notes: 
"Although the cellular phone is only a product, the closure of 
the U.S. markets has psychological repercussions on U.S. trading 
partners, including Thailand." 
  The paper notes: "President Bill Clinton said earlier he 
would probably not take immediate retaliatory action against 
Japan. Nobody knows why he changed his mind. Therefore, we 
should try to find out why he changed his mind so fast." 
  The editorial assumes that the closure of the U.S. cellular 
phone market is a warning to Japan that the United States takes 
the trade deficit problem very seriously and proof of President 
Clinton's decisiveness to the American people. 
  "As for Thailand, we must always remember that the United 
States has been picking on us regarding its trade deficit. 
Seemingly lenient, the United States is very strict with us on 
violations of copyrights and other trade and service rights. We 
are still in a dangerous position, watched closely by the United 
States, and can also face trade retaliation. 
  "We cannot say that the United States will not do anything 
against us. What the United States has done to Japan should 
serve as a warning to all countries to not take advantage of or 
cheat it. It is believed, however, that the United States will 
use careful judgement before punishing any country, otherwise it 
might cause excessive difficulties or a tense situation which 
can trigger violent responses detrimental to the GATT endeavours 
to eliminate tax barriers and other obstacles to strengthening 
the international free trade system."

  [Text] According to Trat Governor Phairot Priyarat, his 
office has written to the Interior Ministry for permission to 
open temporary border crossing points to comply with the 
Cambodian Government's agreement allowing Thai logging firms to 
transport cut logs out of the country by 31 March. Cambodian 
officials are checking the number of these logs. 
  Trat Provincial Forestry Officer Chaikon Sapkit said the 
National Security Council will make the first recommendation on 
opening the border. The issue will then be forwarded to the 
Foreign Ministry, which will submit it to the cabinet for 
approval. The entire process is time-consuming and could be too 
late to meet the Cambodian Government deadline. 
  The five temporary crossing points in Trat that are expected 
to be opened are: 

  -  a) Ban Pong Chi, Tambon Dan Chumphon, Bo 
Rai District for the Phiphat Pamai Company; 
  -  b) Ban Khlong Pun 
Piak, Tambon Dan Chumphon for the Chao Phraya Chai Company; 
  -  c) 
Ban Kraduk Chang, Tambon Dan Chumphon for the Wooden Supply 
Import and Export Company; 
  -  d) Ban Mamuang, Village Group 3, 
Tambon Nonsi, Bo Rai District for the Nit Yothakan Company; and 
  -  e) Ban Tha Sen, Village Group 3, Tambon Laem Klat, Muang 
District for the Thung Din Dam Company. 

    The log transportation ban resulted in 25.21 million cubic 
meters of logs worth 15 billion baht being left in Cambodia and 
the loss of 1.2 million baht daily in use of transportation 
equipment and 150 million baht in skilled and unskilled labor.

  [Text] Defence Minister Wichit Sukmak yesterday said the 
Cabinet was still insisting that the Air Force use the barter 
system to purchase transport planes from Italy. 
  Wichit said the Cabinet had given approval to the Defence 
Ministry to buy six transport planes, worth Bt3.42 billion, from 
Italy, but it must cooperate with the Finance and the Commerce 
ministries to persuade Rome to buy Thai agricultural produce in 
return. Wichit said it would be difficult fol Thailand to ask 
Rome to accept the barter-trade deal since the purchase was not 
at government-to-government level. He also said if the Air 
Force had to coordinate with the other two ministries it might 
delay the plan and "the price will go up." 
  The Cabinet decided last November that the armed forces must 
inform the Commerce Ministy about future arms purchase so that 
it could help to negotiate possible barter deals. The Cabinet's 
move was lauded as a way to end decades of obscure weapons 
purchases which sometimes were plagued with charges about 
irregularities. 
  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai later played down the issue by 
saying that the decision was not mandatory. The Commerce 
Ministry however has set up a committee, chaired by Director 
General of the International Trade Department Oranut Osathanon, 
to study and coordinate potential arms barter-trade deals with 
foreign countries.

  [Text] The Civil Court of the People's Supreme Court 
opened a public session this morning in Hanoi to conduct a 
preliminary-cum-final trial of a case involving the roundabout 
dealings in 4,000 tons of steel designed to support the 
construction of the north-south 500 KV powerline. The dealings 
have caused a loss of 3.1 billion dong to the state budget. 
  Mr. Mai Ngoc Chinh, chief judge of the Civil Court of the 
People's Supreme Court, presided over the court session. 
Attending the session were the plaintiffs' defense lawyers, 
witnesses, and representatives of a number of agencies involved 
in the case.

proceedings, 
the court heard a representative of the Supreme People's Organ 
of Control read the verdict of the Procurator of the Supreme 
People's Organ of Control against the following plaintiffs:

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 17 KYODO -- Japan wants the United 
States to "act sensibly" to address bilateral trade disputes, 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said Thursday [17 
February]. 
  "The leaders of the two nations have agreed on the need for 
a 
cooling-off period for the Japan-U.S. economic talks," the top 
government spokesman told a news conference. "We expect the 
U.S. Government to act sensibly." 
  Takemura's comments came a day after U.S. President Bill 
Clinton said he expects to have policy recommendations drawn up 
in the next few days to slash Japan's vast trade surplus with 
the U.S. 
  The policy options under consideration reportedly include 
the 
renewal of a U.S. trade law that allows retaliatory measures 
against countries which refuse to change what Washington deems 
unfair trade practices. 
  U.S. press reports said a White House decision to revive the 
Super 301 trade measure through executive order is imminent, 
possibly by Thursday. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa failed to narrow 
differences 
with Clinton during a summit meeting last Friday over U.S. 
demands for cutting Japan's trade surplus and boosting the sale 
of foreign goods in Japan. 
  Takemura said Hosokawa will convene a meeting Thursday 
afternoon of Japanese officials who negotiated with the U.S. in 
the economic talks held under a bilateral trade framework accord 
concluded last July. 
  A meeting joined by cabinet ministers will also be held 
sometime in the immediate future, the chief cabinet secretary 
said. 
  Asked about a proposed dispatch of a special envoy to the 
U.S. to break the deadlock on the strained bilateral trade ties, 
Takemura said, "it is a thinkable option." 
  Ichiro Ozawa, a senior leader of Shinseito and the main 
strategist of Hosokawa's ruling coalition, suggested in a press 
interview that the government send an envoy to Washington in 
March to restore trust in the Japan-U.S. relations. 
  Takemura said Tokyo has just unveiled a new economy-spurring 
package and is not considering additional pump-priming measures 
right now. 
  But he also spoke of the need for efforts to reduce Japan's 
trade surplus, which totaled 130 billion dollars last year, 
including about 60 billion dollars with the U.S. 
  "As the Japan-U.S. ties are most important to us, the 
government should do its utmost to solidify the relations once 
again," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 17 KYODO -- A senior Japanese posts 
and telecommunications ministry official said Thursday [17 
February] Japan will not negotiate a cellular phone dispute with 
the United States under a threat of retaliation. 
  Masahito Tani, deputy minister for policy coordination, who 
returned Thursday from a trip to the U.S. for talks on the phone 
issue, also said the U.S. was vague on its argument that Tokyo 
breached a bilateral 1989 accord on boosted foreign access to 
Japan's mobile phone market. 
  In his talks with deputy U.S. Trade Representative Charlene 
Barshefsky, the U.S. side declined to specify which parts of the 
accord Japan has failed to fulfill, Tani said. 
  Citing Japan's perceived breach of the pact, the U.S. 
announced Tuesday its plans to impose sanctions against Japan, a 
move apparently prompted by the breakdown of the bilateral 
"framework" trade talks last week. 
  Futoshi Shirai, vice minister of posts and 
telecommunications, told a separate press meeting that Japan has 
little to do to avert the threatened U.S. sanctions. 
  "We have done what we could, but the U.S. says we have 
breached the accord. I doubt there is anything more we can do," 
he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 17 KYODO -- Deputy Foreign Minister 
Koichiro Matsuura, a top Japanese negotiator in the trade 
"framework" talks with the United States, on Thursday [17 
February] suggested holding informal sessions between the two 
countries to try to thaw the frozen negotiations. 
  Matsuura told a luncheon meeting at the Foreign 
Correspondents Club of Japan it might be more "productive" to 
hold informal meetings than having official discussions under 
the spotlight of public attention. 
  "On our part, we are prepared to get into negotiations 
again, 
but... We have had conceptual difficulties in defining 
'objective criteria'," Matsuura said. 
  "We have to think hard how we can overcome that conceptual 
difference. I hope the American side will also think hard," he 
said. 
  The framework talks, aimed at redressing the bilateral trade 
imbalance, broke down last weekend in Washington over U.S. 
demands that "objective criteria" such as numerical targets be 
set up to gauge foreign access to Japanese markets. 
  Matsuura said the greatest cause of the failure to come to 
full agreement was the different perception of the function of 
past bilateral agreements between Japan and the U.S. 
  The U.S. claimed that the past 30-odd accords between the 
two 
countries have not fulfilled their objectives, citing the 
deteriorating bilateral trade imbalance as proof, he said. 
  The Japanese argued that many accords have achieved their 
initial objectives such as an agreement on NTT procurement and 
one on beef imports, and that the bilateral trade imbalance is 
not the result of the failure of bilateral agreements but is 
caused by macroeconomics, he said. 
  Matsuura said Japan should hammer out a package of voluntary 
actions to deregulate its economy and to take further 
market-opening measures. 
  For example, Tokyo should look more carefully into its 
action 
program on government procurement announced earlier this month 
before the Japan-U.S. summit meeting, and study what additional 
elements it could add to it to introduce more competition and 
more transparency. 
  Concerning auto and auto parts, Matsuura said the Japanese 
and U.S. Governments should encourage cooperation among private 
sectors, saying additional government steps are limited because 
it is a highly deregulated area. 
  Matsuura, who led the Japanese delegation to the framework 
talks, said he feels "very depressed" that the six-month long 
negotiations failed. 
  He said at more than one point he felt the Japanese and U.S. 
delegations would be able to strike a deal and produce a small 
package. 
  It was a "very, very painful decision" for both sides to 
wrap 
up the talks without success. 
  After the luncheon meeting, Matsuura and other senior 
officials of the foreign, finance and trade ministries met with 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to discuss further action Japan 
should take following the breakdown of the talks.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 17 KYODO -- Japan's insurance market is 
more open than that of the United States, a Japanese Government 
source said Thursday [17 February], indicating there is no need 
for Japan to make more concessions in this area in trade talks 
with the U.S. 
  "The insurance market in Japan is far more open than that in 
the United States. The U.S. side is just not making enough 
marketing effort," the source said. 
  Last week, the U.S. and Japan failed to reach agreement on 
liberalizing the Japanese insurance market, one of the three 
priority areas under negotiation in bilateral framework trade 
talks. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton announced Wednesday that to 
address the trade issue, policy recommendations will be drawn up 
by the end of the week which could include revival of the 
punitive Super 301 trade measure. 
  The source indicated the Japanese Government has few new 
measures up its sleeve to respond to the retaliatory measures 
the U.S. may take. 
  "We are already doing everything we can to reduce Japan's 
trade surplus," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 11 KYODO -- California-grown rice, 
imported to meet last year's bad harvest, went on sale in 
supermarkets in Tokyo on Friday [11 February]. 
  The Seiyu chain's Kichijoji store prepared 350 two-kilogram 
bags and another 350 five-kilogram bags of the rice, priced at 
750 yen and 1,850 yen respectively, but they were sold out in 
two hours, store officials said. 
  Japan is expected to import as much as two million tons of 
rice to make up for a shortage resulting from last year's worst 
postwar harvest. 
  Rice produced in the United States, China and Thailand is 
expected to be sold at retailers throughout the nation by late 
February.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 17 KYODO -- The government may draw up 
a set of measures to further liberalize the Japanese market by 
February 26, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura 
indicated Thursday [17 February]. 
  The top government spokesman made the suggestion at a 
regular 
news conference after a meeting among Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and subcabinet-level officials who represented Japan at 
trade negotiations with the United States. 
  "A cabinet-level session will be convened on the matter next 
week," said one government source. 
  Prime Minister Hosokawa plans to focus on improving foreign 
access to the market in a meeting with cabinet members, 
government sources said. 
  They said the scheme, including deregulations and boosting 
imports, is designed to break the impasse in the bilateral 
framework trade talks. 
  The talks to whittle down Japan's lopsided trade surplus 
with 
the United States broke down last week, prompting Washington on 
Tuesday to announce plans to impose sanctions for a slow U.S. 
penetration into Japan's cellular phone market. 
  Takemura said the prime minister and government officials 
confirmed in the meeting that the government will voluntarily 
draw up measures to help slash Japan's vast trade surplus, which 
totaled 130 billion dollars last year, of which about 60 billion 
dollars was with the U.S. 
  The steps include deregulation and promotion of imports and 
investments in Japan, freeing competition for foreign goods and 
services in Japanese markets and improving government 
procurement. 
  Asked if the steps will be compiled before the February 26 
meeting of finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of 
Seven major economic powers in Germany, Takemura replied, "it 
should not be too late." 
  Hosokawa has noted the need for Japan to "swiftly" come up 
with voluntary measures since he and U.S. President Bill Clinton 
failed in their summit last Friday to narrow differences on 
cutting the trade surplus and boosting the sale of foreign goods 
in Japan. 
  Takemura added that a cabinet-ministerial meeting on Japan's 
trade gap with the U.S. should be held as quickly as possible. 
  He also renewed his call on the U.S. to refrain from 
imposing 
retaliatory measures. 
  Clinton said Wednesday he expects to have policy 
recommendations drawn up in the next few days to address the 
bilateral disputes. 
  The options under consideration reportedly include 
resurrection of a U.S. trade law that allows punitive measures 
against countries that refuse to change what Washington deems 
are unfair trade practices. 
  U.S. press reports said a White House decision to revive the 
"Super 301" trade measure through executive order is imminent, 
possibly by Thursday.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 17 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Thursday [17 February] that five ministers will 
join a cabinet task force next week to work out fresh Japanese 
market- opening measures following last week's virtual collapse 
of bilateral trade "framework" talks. 
  Hosokawa said the five are Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, 
Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, International Trade and Industry 
Minister Hiroshi Kumagai, Posts and Telecommunication Minister 
Takenori Kanzaki and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. 
  Two deputy chief cabinet secretaries, Yukio Hatoyama and 
Nobuo Ishihara, will also become members of the cabinet-level 
forum, Hosokawa said. 
  The forum will hammer out a package of market-opening 
measures which will include ways to promote deregulation, 
imports and investments. It will also include measures to 
tighten antitrust policies and improve government procurement 
procedures, government sources said. 
  Asked by reporters when the task force will reach a final 
conclusion on the package, Hosokawa said "I still do not know." 
  Hosokawa denied that he himself will ask U.S. President Bill 
Clinton by letter or telephone not to take punitive actions 
against Japan. 
  Clinton and Hosokawa, who met in Washington last weekend, 
failed to reach an accord over the trade framework. 
  The president said Wednesday he expects to have policy 
recommendations drawn up in the next few days to slash Japan's 
vast trade surplus with the U.S. totaling 50 billion dollars 
annually.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 14 KYODO -- The chairman of 
leading Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp. expressed concern 
over the surge in the yen against the U.S. dollar Monday [14 
February]. 
  Toyoda, who is in Washington for the Japan-U.S. business 
conference, said, "an excessive rise in the yen is not good." 
  "Lifting the yen is surely not the solution for all 
problems," he said, disagreeing with the view that a rise in the 
Japanese currency is the only way left to rectify Japan's trade 
surplus with the United States. 
  He suggested that the monetary authorities should step in to 
stop the dollar from falling further. 
  "There must be an appropriate level that reflects economic 
fundamentals, and we should help the market get nearer that 
level," Toyoda said. 
  In New York trading Monday the yen soared momentarily to 
101.10 to the dollar, and in late trading stood at 102.15-25 
yen, up 4.85 yen from the previous session.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 17 KYODO -- Consumers are buying more 
imports as the yen's appreciation makes foreign goods cheaper, 
according to an Economic Planning Agency (EPA) report published 
Thursday [17 February]. 
  The survey said 24.8 percent of those polled said they buy 
imports more frequently than before, up 10.2 percentage points 
from the previous survey taken in May. 
  Asked whether the yen's rise has helped cut the prices of 
imports, 65.4 percent answered yes, against 43.9 percent in the 
May poll. 
  People who answered they see no price changes despite the 
stronger yen accounted for only 18.8 percent of respondents, 
sharply down from 35.8 percent, a finding indicating that 
importers have been passing on the high-yen benefits to 
consumers. 
  The poll was conducted in mid-December on 4,200 people 
nationwide, of which 92.3 percent responded. 
  More than half -- 57.9 percent -- also wanted to see price 
cuts on everyday goods rather than luxury goods.

source said Thursday [17 February] the central bank is ready to 
show its determination to prevent the yen from rising sharply. 
The source made the remarks shortly after the U.S. Commerce 
Department released 1993 and December trade figures. 
  The department said the United States had a record 
merchandise trade deficit of 59.3 billion dollars in 1993 with 
Japan, while its deficit in December shrank to 5.30 billion 
dollars from 5.72 billion dollars in November. 
  "The December trade deficit figure was smaller than 
expected," the source said on condition of anonymity, noting the 
improvement reflects a steady recovery of U.S. competitiveness.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 17 (YONHAP) -- The Japanese Government 
is seeking to resume negotiations on normalizing ties with North 
Korea since Pyongyang decided to allow inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency, NHK (NIHON HOSO KYOKAI) 
television reported on Thursday. 
  "Pyongyang seems to have decided to accept nuclear 
inspections because it wanted to deal with economic problems 
such as food shortages and to keep relations with the 
international community from deteriorating further. The 
Japanese Government regards Pyongyang's decision as a change in 
attitude toward the international community, and so decided to 
work to restart negotiations with Pyongyang on normalizing 
ties," NHK said. 
  Negotiations between Japan and North Korea broke off at the 
eighth round of talks in Beijing in November 1992, when Tokyo 
demanded an investigation into the alleged abduction of a 
Japanese woman named "Yi Un-hui." 
  North Korean terrorist Kim Hyon-hui, who planted a bomb on a 
South Korean airplane that exploded over the Andaman Sea off 
Myanmar in November 1987, confessed that she had learned 
Japanese from a Japanese woman who had been abducted from Japan 
to Pyongyang by North Korean agents. 
  Pyongyang refused the investigation demand and no meetings 
between Tokyo and Pyongyang have been held since.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 17 KYODO -- Japan intends to soon 
resume small-scale grant assistance to Myanmar [Burma], 
suspended in part over the refusal of the military government 
there to transfer power to elected civilians, Foreign Ministry 
sources said Thursday [17 February]. 
  The sources said Japan will likely resume such aid by the 
end 
of March, while continuing its suspension of new official loans 
to Myanmar in light of the continued house detention of 
opposition leader Aung Sang Suu Kyi. 
  One source said Japan's grant assistance would not go to the 
Myanmar Government, but for projects being implemented at the 
grass- roots level by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). 
  The sources said the Japanese Government has already 
notified 
the United States of its intentions. Washington has strongly 
criticized the Myanmar junta over alleged human rights 
violations. 
  A number of requests have already been received from NGOs 
operating in Myanmar for project funding, the sources said. 
  Each project approved will likely be supported to the tune 
of 
several millions of yen, they said. 
  Japan considered a possible resumption of official loans in 
January, when Myanmar's national convention to debate a new 
constitution was resumed, the sources said. 
  The idea was dropped, however, when it became clear there 
remained no sign that Aung San Suu Kyi would be released, they 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 17 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Thursday [17 February] that he wants to visit 
European nations before the summit meeting of the Group of Seven 
(G- 7) leading industrialized nations scheduled from July 8 to 
10 in Naples, Italy. 
  "If possible, I want to visit Europe before the summit," 
Hosokawa said in a meeting with some 30 members of the 
Japan-Germany Dialogue Forum held at his official residence. 
  Hosokawa, who assumed the premiership last August, has 
already visited the United States and South Korea, but has not 
yet had a chance to go to Europe.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 17 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata is likely to visit Moscow next month if next week's 
working-level meeting on a bilateral territorial dispute shows 
progress, government sources said Thursday [17 February]. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Hiroshi Fukuda and Russian Vice 
Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov are scheduled to meet in Moscow 
Monday and Tuesday to discuss both nations' claims to a handful 
of Russian-held islands off the eastern tip of Hokkaido. 
  It will be the first working-level session to be held since 
last September's visit to Tokyo by Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin. 
  Fukuda and other Japanese negotiators are expected to 
propose 
expanding visits to Japan by the residents of the disputed 
islands and to let citizens of both countries know about a 
jointly-edited collection of historical materials regarding the 
territorial dispute, the sources said. 
  If the talks progress, Hata will probably visit Moscow on 
March 19-21, the sources said. 
  Tokyo will also be watching to see what influence Russian 
conservatives and rightists, who are opposed to the reversion of 
the islands to Japan and who did well in last December's 
parliamentary elections, have on the territorial discussion. 
  Both sides are also expected to exchange views on bilateral 
trade, North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development program, 
and strife in the Balkans, the sources said. 
  Tokyo claims Kunashiri, Etorofu, Shikotan and the Habomai 
group, which were overrun by the army of the former Soviet Union 
at the end of World War II.

Society said Wednesday [16 February] it will ship some nine tons 
of medicine worth 80 million yen to Irkutsk in the Russian Far 
East by chartered aircraft Thursday. 
  The medical aid is part of assistance which Japan pledged to 
the former Soviet Union. 
  With the same shipment a medical microscope will be 
delivered 
to the local red cross society. It was purchased with some 
500,000 yen in donations from the family of student Chieko Noda, 
who died in an airplane crash in Irkutsk in January at the age 
of 25.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 17 KYODO -- Japan and New Zealand have 
agreed to open a new flight route from Japan's new Kansai 
International Airport to New Zealand, a government official said 
Thursday [17 February]. 
  Under the accord at the bilateral aviation talks held in New 
Zealand, Japan Airlines (JAL) and Air New Zealand will operate 
the flights together three times a week, the official at the 
Transport Ministry said. 
  Air New Zealand will also make separate flights of its own 
on 
the route three times a week. 
  JAL will give over to Air New Zealand the route between 
Nagoya and New Zealand, being jointly operated by JAL and Air 
New Zealand, late next month. 
  JAL decided that it would be better to change to a route 
from 
the new Kansai airport, to open this fall, since most of its 
passengers who use the flights from Nagoya are from the Kansai 
region. 
  JAL is thinking of introducing a route from Kansai to either 
Christchurch or Auckland, while Air New Zealand is considering a 
route to either of those destinations with a stopover at 
Brisbane, Australia, the official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 KYODO -- The Japanese Government on 
Friday [18 February] decided to launch an investigation into 
alleged dumping of Pakistani cotton yarns in Japan under the 
Customs Tariff Law. 
  A team of officials from the Finance Ministry and the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) will be sent 
to Pakistan soon, and on the basis of its findings the 
government will decide within a year whether or not to levy a 
countervailing duty on cotton yarns imported from Pakistan. 
  This is the second time that the Japanese Government has 
investigated alleged dumping of goods in Japan by foreign 
interests. 
  The first case involves the dumping of ferrosilico-manganese 
in Japan by Chinese, Norwegian and South African concerns. 
  The Finance Ministry took up the yarn dumping issue in 
response to a suit filed last December by the Japan Spinners' 
Association, which claimed about 200 Pakistani manufacturers had 
exported cotton yarn for towels and sheets to Japan below the 
fair market value, causing damage to Japanese yarn manufacturers.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 16 KYODO -- Japan will invite 20 
Argentines between the ages of 25 and 35 for a training program 
to deepen their understanding of Japan, Foreign Ministry 
officials said Wednesday [16 February]. 
  The program will be held from February 23 to March 9. 
  The Argentines, who hail from the government, economic and 
academic circles, will have the opportunity to hold talks with 
Japanese Government officials and business people, the officials 
said. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa had proposed the training 
program when Argentine President Carlos Menem visited Japan last 
December. 
  The participants will attend lectures on Japanese history, 
culture, economics and diplomacy and will visit the Diet and 
automobile factories, they said. 
  The Argentines will also stay with Japanese families in 
Hiroshima and Kyoto, the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 17 KYODO -- Leaders of three out of the 
seven ruling parties appeared Thursday [17 February] to have 
agreed to oppose an early cabinet reshuffle being considered by 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, political sources said. 
  The heads of the Social Democratic Party, the Democratic 
Socialist Party [DSP] and Sakigake (Harbinger) reached the 
accord in a meeting Thursday night, the sources said. 
  They were Tomiichi Murayama of the SDP, Keigo Ouchi of the 
DSP, and Masayoshi Takemura of Sakigake. Ouchi serves as the 
health and welfare minister, while Takemura is the chief cabinet 
secretary. 
  Earlier this week, Hosokawa said he is considering an early 
cabinet reshuffle, hinting at removing Takemura from the key 
position of chief cabinet secretary, a post serving as the prime 
minister's chief spokesman and also chief of staff. 
  On Wednesday, Hosokawa told a parliamentary session he has 
yet to decide whether to reshuffle his cabinet, but failed to 
rule out such a move. "The issue is still a blank piece of 
paper," he said. 
  On Thursday, Hosokawa reiterated to reporters that he is 
undecided whether to reshape the cabinet.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 17 KYODO -- A Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI] official said Thursday 
[17 February] Japan might propose a five-year income tax cut 
plan to show "our resolution" to stimulate domestic demand. 
  The high-ranking official, who asked not to be identified, 
told reporters the planned concession is part of new proposals 
to break the deadlocked Japan-U.S. framework trade talks. 
  President Bill Clinton reportedly expressed his 
dissatisfaction with a one-year income tax reduction, which is 
the pillar of Japan's largest-ever pump-priming package, during 
his meeting with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa last week. 
  "Japan has to take the initiative by proposing some new 
concessions" to get bilateral negotiations moving again, the 
official said. 
  Earlier in the day, MITI Vice Minister Hideaki Kumano, 
speaking at a press conference, said the recent sharp yen surge 
against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the 
world economy and that of Japan as well. 
  The Japanese currency strengthened dramatically in the wake 
of failure of the framework negotiations at the Japan-U.S. 
summit meeting and Clinton's remarks that "objective criteria" 
will include foreign exchange movements. 
  The dollar closed Thursday trading in Tokyo at 103.48 yen, 
up 
from 108.25 yen on Friday.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 17 KYODO -- The just-announced cut in 
the German benchmark rate is an appropriate step that will 
positively affect the domestic and European economies, a Bank of 
Japan (BOJ) source said Thursday night [17 February]. 
  The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, "the 
cut was made in consideration of the domestic economy and I 
think it's an appropriate measure. 
  "It will have a good effect on the European economy as 
well," 
the source said. 
  The Bundesbank announced it will reduce the discount rate to 
5.25 percent from 5.75 percent, effective Friday, while leaving 
the Lombard emergency financing rate unchanged at 6.75 percent. 
  The move will have "no particular impact on Japan's 
financial 
policy," the source added.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 17 KYODO -- Japan's benchmark money 
supply grew 1.6 percent in January from a year before, the Bank 
of Japan said in a preliminary report Thursday [17 February]. 
  That was up 0.2 percentage point from a revised 1.4 percent 
year-to-year expansion for December, the report said. 
  The broader measure of liquidity, including postal savings, 
government bonds and investment trusts, rose 3.0 percent in 
January from a year before, after a preliminary 2.9 percent 
year-to-year gain in December. 
  The closely watched money supply figure measures cash in 
circulation, time and demand deposits and certificates of 
deposit (CDs). Its outstanding balance for January averaged 
513.7 trillion yen, the central bank said. 
  The January 1.6 percent year-on-year increase marked the 
first growth pace pickup in four months. 
  Although January's year-to-year money supply growth exceeded 
that of December, it represented one-time factors rather than a 
change in trend, a central bank official said. 
  He predicted money supply growth would stay in the 1.0-2.0 
percent range for the next couple of months, as it has since May. 
  One factor making the January figure look bigger was the end 
of the effect on year-to-year comparisons caused by a change 
last year in the tax system to monthly payments of inheritance 
taxes, the official told reporters. They had been paid in 
twice-yearly lump sums before that. 
  Also, a weaker yen last month inflated the value of foreign- 
currency holdings in yen terms, he said. 
  Asked about the effect of this week's sharp surge by the 
yen, 
the official said it is too early to tell if it will continue 
and contribute to lowering the February money supply results. 
  During January, CDs declined from a year earlier, but growth 
picked up in time and demand deposits. 
  January's 1.6 percent money supply growth roughly met the 
expectations of economists at 12 financial institutions who had 
predicted 1.5 percent year-to-year growth for January. 
  The survey earlier this week by KYODO NEWS SERVICE found 
predictions ranging from 1.3 percent to 1.9 percent.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 16 KYODO -- Newly appointed vice farm 
minister said Wednesday [16 February] his top priority is to 
create a healthier agricultural infrastructure in Japan to 
prepare the country for the opening of the rice market from next 
year. 
  Toshihiko Tsuruoka, former director general of the Food 
Agency, told a press conference that farming in Japan will be 
very different in the future from what it is today. 
  "Creating a stronger farming base is my task. Japan is small 
but the land has high productivity. So I believe that we can do 
it if proper measures suited to each region are taken," he said. 
  Asked about criticism that farm ministry officials should 
take responsibility for Japan's decision to lift its ban on rice 
imports last year, Tsuruoka said his responsibility "lies in 
carrying out what I should do, which is to help farmers prepare 
for the rice market opening." 
  Former vice farm minister Akio Kyoya, also at the press 
meeting, said he had to make "a painful choice" as a negotiator 
directly involved in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks, 
which completed in December. 
  He denied any connection between the rice decision and his 
retirement.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 17 KYODO -- The electric power industry 
is gearing up to introduce mixed oxide fuel, made up of uranium 
and plutonium, in light water nuclear power reactors as early as 
1998, industry sources said Thursday [17 February]. Currently 
such nuclear plants are driven by enriched uranium. 
  The end of the Cold War has spurred greater interest in use 
of surplus plutonium as fuel for nuclear power stations, the 
sources said. 
  Japan's nine major electricity utilities and Japan Atomic 
Power Co. will select at least one power plant in which the 
mixed oxide fuel will be used, the sources said. They said 
mixed oxide fuel will account for one-third or one- quarter of 
the total fuel for nuclear power stations. 
  Japan Atomic Power was jointly established by the nine power 
firms and the semigovernmental Electric Power Development Co. in 
1957. 
  The power industry plans to use 30 tons of plutonium to be 
obtained from Britain and France for such fuel. Japan has 
entrusted the two European countries to reprocess spent nuclear 
fuel. 
  Tokyo Electric Power Co. and Kansai Electric Power Co. had 
planned to introduce mixed oxide fuel for a boiling water 
reactor and pressurized water reactor, respectively, on a trial 
basis in the middle of the 1990s. 
  The plans have made little headway, however, prompting the 
10 
companies to consider using the fuel for a light water reactor 
in a move to rein in the generation of surplus plutonium, the 
sources said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 17 KYODO -- Payments by a government- 
backed body to compensate workers for unpaid wages and severance 
pay have hit an annual record, the Labor Welfare Corp. said 
Thursday [17 February]. 
  The Labor Ministry-backed corporation told KYODO NEWS 
SERVICE 
that as of February 10, fiscal 1993 payments totaled 4,032 
million yen, the highest since the corporation was established 
in 1976. 
  A total of 12,484 workers from 662 companies, mostly small 
businesses, received the benefits. 
  Payments for the year ending next March 31 are expected to 
reach 4.8 billion yen, more than double the 2.27 billion yen the 
year before, the corporation said. 
  The previous annual record was 3,864 million yen, paid to 
17,300 workers in fiscal 1985. 
  The corporation pays wages and severance pay to employees on 
behalf of their bankrupt and financially troubled employers.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 17 KYODO -- Nec Corp. said Thursday 
[17 February] it has developed a large-scale integration (LSI) 
chip that would make it possible to process moving video images 
with a single chip. 
  The leading Japanese electronics manufacturer said it is the 
world's first microchip capable of processing moving images 
produced by video cameras. 
  With current technology, a desk-size computer system would 
be 
needed for similar processing. 
  NEC said potential applications of the chip include a 
computer- based multimedia terminal that would handle image and 
voice data, as in teleconferencing. 
  The chip, 15.1 by 15.6 millimeters, comprises 10 million 
transistors, 64 processors for image processing and a 
two-million- bit memory device, NEC said. 
  The processors, through parallel data processing, make it 
possible to perform 3.84 billion calculations per second, NEC 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 17 KYODO -- Fujitsu Ltd., Japan's 
largest computer maker, said Thursday [17 February] it has 
developed an improved version of the so-called quantum effect 
transistor which has both logic and memory functions in addition 
to the usual on-off function. 
  With this special effect the multi-emitter 
resonant-tunneling 
hot electron transistor (ME-RHET) will help reduce the number of 
components of computer chips to about one-ninth, Fujitsu 
officials said. 
  For example, a pilot type of this transistor coupled with a 
resistor can perform on par with a circuit of 18 ordinary 
transistors and resistors, they said. 
  The new transistor is one of the major fruits of a project 
supervised by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. 
  In line with the project aim of developing ultra-small, 
quantum- effect device fabrication technology in the near 
future, Fujitsu released the first version of the transistor in 
1985, the officials said.

  [Text] Today at 0830 Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, 
first prime minister; and Samdech Hun Sen, second prime minister 
of the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC], received His 
Excellency [H.E.] Nguyen Manh Cam, Vietnamese foreign minister, 
who is visiting the Kingdom of Cambodia. The visit of the 
Vietnamese foreign minister is to prepare for the official visit 
by H.E. Vo Van Kiet, Vietnamese prime minister, planned for next 
month at the behest of the two Cambodian prime ministers. 
  During the one-hour meeting, Prince Krompreah Norodom 
Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen welcomed and highly appreciated 
the talks between Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut, minister of 
foreign affairs and international cooperation, with H.E. Nguyen 
Manh Cam, concerning bilateral cooperation in economics, trade, 
science and technology, culture, and tourism. The two sides 
agreed on peaceful coexistence and improving cooperation and 
good relations as neighboring countries in order to create peace 
and stability in the region. 
  Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen 
affirmed the government position on the issue of the border with 
Vietnam, saying that this should be resolved peacefully through 
mutual understanding and based on legal principles. 
  Concerning the issue of Vietnamese residents living in 
Cambodia and some who have returned to live along the border, 
the two Cambodian prime ministers specified that a solution will 
be found which is acceptable to national and international 
circles. 
  The two prime ministers stressed the difficulty involved in 
Cambodia's immigration law, soon to be promulgated, to ensure 
residence in Cambodia by immigrants because this matter is 
related to security problems caused by the Khmer Rouge group. 
In the past, Vietnamese immigrants had been the target of Khmer 
Rouge attacks. 
  Concerning the Mekong River, the two prime ministers and the 
Vietnamese foreign minister will find a common solution to 
continue and facilitate navigation through Vietnam and Cambodia 
without hindrance. An appeal was made to Laos to cooperate in 
ensuring the Mekong's suitability for serving the economic 
progress of each country and to avoid harming the environment. 
  Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen 
expressed their joy and told the Vietnamese foreign minister 
that the Cambodian Government is happy with the end of U.S. 
economic sanctions against Vietnam.

  [Text] Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut, deputy prime 
minister and minister of foreign affairs and international 
cooperation, held a working meeting on the morning of 16 
February with Vietnamese Foreign Minister His Excellency [H.E.] 
Nguyen Manh Cam and his entourage, who are officially visiting 
Cambodia. The prince welcomed the Vietnamese foreign minister's 
visit to Cambodia, considering it a new step toward reinforcing 
the mutual understanding and the relations of friendship between 
the two countries. 
  In his reply, H.E. Ngyuen Manh Cam recalled the traditional 
relations between Vietnam and Cambodia as well as the 
traditional struggle conducted by the two peoples for their own 
independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. 
  He also spoke about Vietnam's past economic, social, and 
diplomatic achievements and the country's efforts to promote 
fine relations with its neighbors and other countries with a 
view to strengthening regional stability. 
  H.E. Nguyen Manh Cam said Vietnam can never forget 
Cambodia's 
support and assistance in the 1960's. He thanked His Majesty 
King Norodom Sihanouk Varaman for his policy toward the 
Vietnamese people's struggle. He was confident that under the 
king's leadership, Cambodia would successfully achieve national 
reconciliation and peace and have good relations with its 
neighbors. He reaffirmed that Vietnam always respects Cambodia's 
independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity and wants 
to have harmonious relations and cooperation with the latter for 
the sake of the two countries' interests. 
  Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut promised to present the 
invitation for the king to visit Vietnam soon. 
  In the meeting, the two sides discussed the border issue and 
the issue of Vietnamese immigrants and decided to set up two 
processes. The first is to establish the border negotiation 
framework in order to turn the Cambodian-Vietnamese border into 
a border of lasting peace and friendship so as to ensure 
security along the border. On this issue, the prince said 
discussion over the matter should be based on the Kingdom of 
Cambodia's border of the 1960's that was recognized by Vietnam 
and certain other countries and in the spirit of the 23 October 
1991 Paris accord, which has a clause stipulating that every 
agreement concluded before 23 October 1991 and contrary to the 
spirit of the Paris accord concerning Cambodia's sovereignty 
should be considered null and void. Concerning the second 
process for determining the status of Vietnamese immigrants, the 
prince said the issue of the immigrants will be examined after 
the Cambodian National Assembly has adopted an immigration law 
and that it will be resolved according to international law and 
practice. 
  The two sides jointly denounced past violence against the 
Vietnamese immigrants. They also discussed the issue of a 
Mekong committee and concurred that exploitation of the Mekong 
River should be conducted based on unanimous agreement; this is 
in the interests of all countries with access to the river.

  [Text] Phnom Penh AKP February 17 -- Vietnamese Foreign 
Minister Nguyen Manh Cam agreed in principal to discuss the 
controversial issue of border demarcation between Vietnam and 
Cambodia, Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut said 
Wednesday, 16 February. 
  "We agreed with each other about the mechanism, the 
framework, we would like to have to discuss this," the prince 
said after lengthy talks here with his Vietnamese counterpart. 
  Other items on the agenda were the issue of Vietnamese 
settlers in Cambodia, trade facilities and customs regulations. 
  "But I told my Vietnamese friends the border problem is the 
main problem," the prince said. 
  The prince said he hoped further progress would be made when 
Vietnamese premier Vo Van Kiet visited Cambodia in March or 
April. 
  Prince Sirivut said he told the Vietnamese side that the 
government was also aware of Hanoi's concern about the fate of 
thousands of ethnic Vietnamese who fled to the border between 
the two countries last April to escape a Khmer Rouge campaign of 
ethnic cleansing and have since been barred from re-entering 
Cambodia.

<F P=106> ["Clarification" issued by the Party of Democratic Kampuchea </F>
spokesman; dated 16 February] 
  [Text] I. For a month long, from mid-January to 
mid-February, the two-headed government and the puppets of 
communist Vietnam and their masters have time and again claimed 
that they have captured Anlung Veng. On 15 January and on 17, 
20, 23, 27, and 31 January, they claimed the capture of Anlung 
Veng and informed national and international news reporters of 
the visit to Anlung Veng. 
  II. However, the news reporters have been waiting from one 
day to another till they have lost patience and accused the 
two-headed government of deceitful attempts. Such a scornful 
accusation has become the talk of the town, as the reporters and 
people in Phnom Penh know that the two-headed government and the 
puppets have suffered defeat after defeat in their operations in 
the direction of Anlung Veng. They had been severely defeated 
in their first, second, and third attempts. Their soldiers have 
suffered heavy casualties, both killed and wounded. They have 
died on the battlefield and from starvation, lack of water, 
malaria. Many of them have deserted. Even with such heavy 
casualties, the Hanoi authority and the entente continue to 
order the two-headed government and the puppets to launch the 
fourth attempt of military operation starting from 9 February. 
However, their soldiers -- who have low morale -- have 
deserted. Even the commanders of the operation -- such as Long 
Sopheap, Prum Samen, Keo Pisit -- have been scared of the 
battlefield as they have seen many generals, colonels, and other 
military officers killed or wounded at the front, and they are 
facing a deadly encirclement by the National Army of Democratic 
Kampuchea [NADK]. 
  III. The spokesman of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea 
[PDK] would like to make the following clarification: 
  First, the region of Anlung Veng still remains in the hands 
of the PDK, but it has been transformed into a battleground 
between, on the one hand, the forces of the two-headed 
government and the puppets, and on the other hand, the forces of 
the NADK and the local people. The fighting continues unabated. 
However, the most outstanding feature is the fact that the NADK 
and the local people have been able to encircle the headquarters 
of the enemy commanding post where Long Sopheap, Prum Samen, Keo 
Pisit, and quite a number of other generals have to stay 
permanently in their tanks and always on the move in western and 
southern parts of Anlung Veng region. Their tanks and heavy guns 
have been under constant attacks by the NADK and must be on the 
move at all times. But they are facing another difficulty; that 
is, the shortage of gasoline. 
  Secondly, from 9 to 15 February, for seven days, the 
front-line commanders of the troops of the two-headed government 
had been encircled by the NADK and local people who can see that 
those puppet commanders were either put to rout or killed on the 
spot. Those who were able to escape with their troops from the 
frontline were intercepted and inflicted heavy casualties by our 
NADK units. The enemy situation has been in a desperate 
position because of several factors: 
  1. They are hundreds of kilometers far from their near 
bases; 
  2. They have no one civilian who supports them in the 
region; 
  3. They cannot supply themselves on the spot. In a word, 
they are like in desert. Everyday, because of food supply, they 
complain about ammunition shortage, about the non-forthcoming of 
tanks, heavy guns because they had in Phnom Penh, and complain 
about diarrhea and other diseases which have target their 
troops. [sentence as heard] On top of the list, because of 
fatigue, desertion has increased. 
  Thirdly, experiences of wars in the world have indicated 
that 
when the enemies stay in such an encircled position, cut off 
from their supply bases -- such were the case of Stalingrad 
during the Second World War and Dien Bien Phu in Vietnam -- they 
are finally annihilated. 
  Fourthly, during the course of the war in general and during 
a major operation in particular, the gain of lots of towns has 
its own significance [words indistinct]. The most important one 
is the elimination of the enemy strength. If the enemies lose 
their strength on the battlefield, they will lose their fighting 
forces and the towns they occupy. Experiences of the wars in 
Cambodia and in the world have clearly vindicated that 
particular view. 
  IV. Can communist Vietnam and its puppets and the two- 
headed government and the entente -- who have worked out and 
implemented their strategies and tactics of starting the current 
situation through the pursuit of the war -- resolve the problem? 
What will be their fate? Is not a peaceful conciliation better? 
To such questions, the answers are as follows: 
  Firstly, the above-cited questions can be answered by 
another 
question. On the battlefield of Anlung Veng, how many more days 
or months or seasons can the forces of the two-headed government 
continue the fighting, as they are in a desert land; they are 
encircled and cut off from their supply bases; and they have 
been under a constant attack, especially the guerrilla warfare 
of the NADK and local people? 
  Secondly, another question is: Taking into consideration the 
situation in Cambodia as a whole, are the old and new aggressors 
and their puppets as strong as Americans and Lon Nol? Do they 
have as much money as at that time? Are they as strong as the 
first Khmer war of the communist Vietnamese with hundreds of 
thousands of troops from 1978 to 1991? The next question that 
comes to mind is: What will be the fate of the two-headed 
government who wants to continue the Vietnamese war? 
  Thirdly, another question is: Who wants national 
conciliation and peace? Who are against them? These questions 
are linked to the question of forces. Those who want national 
conciliation and peace will have forces. Those who are against 
them will not have forces. That is indeed a basic and strategic 
issue. Who supports the national conciliation and peace in 
accordance with His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk's five-point 
guideline? It is the entire Cambodian nation and people based 
in the countryside and in the cities, at home and abroad, and 
peace-loving countries and people in the world, especially those 
of Asia, who want peace, security, and stability in the region. 
  Fourth, the entire Cambodian nation and people have risen up 
to uphold the five-point national conciliation banner of His 
Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk. These forces are gaining 
strength by the day from one month or season to another. These 
forces will certainly get rid of the aggressors, the warmongers, 
those who oppose national conciliation and peace, and the 
puppets of communist Vietnam until the banner of national 
conciliation and peace of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk will 
fly all over the country. 
  World War I and World War II experiences, as well as 
regional 
wars, have vindicated that the aggressors and their puppets will 
be eliminated by the forces of the entire nation and people. 
The fate of the old and new aggressors and their puppets in 
Cambodia will certainly not be different. 
  [Dated] 16 February 1994 
  [Signed] The spokesman of the PDK

District, Kompong Chhnang Province. They completely burned down 
this puppet commune office. 
  2. Also on 6 February, the people and militiamen who are 
angry with constant oppression of the puppet state authority, 
cooperated to attack and dismantle the brutal state authority in 
(Lambao), Russei commune, in Srei Santhor District, Kompong Cham 
Province. Two officials of Vietnam's puppet state authority were 
killed and five AK rifles seized. 
  3. On 10 February, forces of communist Vietnam's puppets 
attacked and robbed people. They were ambushed by the people 
and militiamen near Thleay village, Thleay commune, in Memot 
District, Kompong Cham Province. Three were killed and five 
others wounded. Three AK rifles were seized and a car destroyed. 
  4. On 11 February people and militiamen ambushed Memot 
district troops who were on their way to attack and rob people. 
Three were killed and two others wounded; another two were 
arrested. A B-40 rocket launcher and 10 rockets were seized. 
  5. Also on 11 February, armed people who are constantly 
angry with the state authority of the communist Vietnam's 
puppets, revolted and attacked Ph'av town in Cheung Prey 
District, Kompong Cham Province, killing three local soldiers. 
They also destroyed two army vehicles, two tractors, and three 
warehouses. 
  The rubber plantation in Chamka Andong and other rubber 
plantations are all under Vietnamese control. Each month 
hundreds of tonnes of rubber are taken to Vietnam and sold for 
millions of dollars. The people are very angry because the 
rubber belongs to Cambodia but has been taken to Vietnam. 
Cambodia receives nothing. Therefore, the people have been 
killing communist Vietnamese and destroying the rubber of 
communist Vietnam's puppets. 
  6. On 13 February, state authority forces in Chamka Leu 
District attacked and arrested people who were collecting latex 
in Krek. They were ambushed by the people and militiamen in this 
rubber plantation. Two were killed and five others wounded. 
  7. Also on 13 February, people and village militiamen who 
are angry with brutal leaders of village and commune state 
authority -- that have been rounding up people's children to 
fight and die on its behalf -- attacked the commune office in 
Anlung Ak, Sokorng commune, in Kang Meas District, Kompong Cham 
Province. 
  8. On 10 February people and militiamen, who have been 
maltreated countless times by the village and commune state 
authority of the communist Vietnam's puppets, revolted and 
attacked Tang Krasang commune office in Santuk District, Kompong 
Thom Province. They completely destroyed this office.

  [Text] Manila, Feb. 17 KYODO -- Philippine defense 
officials have held "secret" meetings with their Taiwanese 
counterparts over the acquisition of 12 F-5E fighters Taiwan 
plans to discard once it acquires French-made Mirage fighters, a 
senior defense official said Thursday [17 February]. 
  The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told 
KYODO 
NEWS SERVICE that Defense Undersecretary Ernesto Gidaya had been 
invited to Taipei "several times" to talk about acquisition of 
the aircraft, though Gidaya is using veterans' activities as a 
cover for his trips. 
  The source said that even before the informal meeting 
between 
President Fidel Ramos and Taiwanese President Li Teng-hui on 
February 9 in Subic Freeport, 126 kilometers northwest of 
Manila, "there had been low-key defense and military contacts 
between the two countries." 
  The three-hour Ramos-Li meeting at Subic drew the ire of 
China, and Manila has since been walking a tightrope in its 
relations with Beijing and Taipei. 
  The Philippine Government had asked Taiwan in August 1992 to 
either donate or sell its old aircraft at concessionary rates to 
the Philippine Air Force. 
  The Foreign Affairs Department made a recommendation that 
year to purchase the planes, in a memorandum to Defense 
Secretary Renato S. De Villa, following the U.S. 
Administration's decision to allow defense sales to Taiwan for 
the first time since a break in diplomatic relations in 1979. 
  The Philippine armed forces, regarded as the most obsolete 
of 
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), launched a 
10-year program in 1991 to modernize its inventory of World War 
II and Vietnam war vintage planes and ships. The 10 billion 
dollar program has so far progressed at a snail's pace due to 
lack of funds.

<F P=106> [By Merlinda Manalo] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo expressed 
confidence yesterday China's protest over the meeting between 
President Ramos and his Taiwanese counterpart, Li Teng-hui, will 
not harm long-term RP [Republic of the Philippines]-China bond. 
  "From our perspective, we hope that situation (with China) 
will continue as it is, and on the same basis as before," Romulo 
said, adding: 
  "I am confident that in the long-term, friendly and cordial 
ties with China will be enhanced further." 
  Romulo stressed the Philippines continues to adhere to a 
`One-China' policy and clarified that a committee chaired by 
Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino formed last year 
was not meant to revise nor reassess the country's "One-China" 
policy. 
  According to Romulo, the President's orders to the Severino 
committee does not include a review of the Philippines' 
`One-China' policy but only focused on studies on a "wholistic" 
approach regarding the country's relations with China and 
economic ties with Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau. 
  Romulo said President Ramos ordered the formation of the 
committee after his state visit to China to underscore that 
country's importance to the Philippines, Asia, and the rest of 
the world as an emerging superpower and a key economic player in 
the world market. 
  Romulo stressed that the government did not violate its 
`One-China' policy because President Ramos' meeting with Li last 
Wednesday in Subic only focused on trade and investments. 
  "Trade, investments, and economic diplomacy with Taiwan is 
not in contradiction with the `One-China' policy," Romulo said. 
  The Chinese Embassy, however, stressed the meeting violated 
the Philippine policy on recognizing only one China. It 
emphasized that before the Ramos-Li meeting took place, the 
Chinese Government had repeatedly expressed concern over Li's 
trips to Southeast Asia. 
  "The incident has greatly hurt the feelings of the Chinese 
people and sabotaged friendly relations between China and the 
Philippines. Thus, the Chinese Embassy is instructed to lodge a 
protest with the Philippine Government." 
  The embassy said it hoped the Philippines would learn a 
lesson from the recent incident and would prevent similar events 
from recurring in the future. 
  A DFA [Department of Foreign Affairs] official, however, 
said 
that the Chinese Government's protest was "baseless" since the 
meeting could not be construed as a violation of the 
Philippines' `One-China' policy. 
  Romulo said that the Chinese Government "may be dismayed but 
they cannot be surprised" over the Ramos-Li meeting since they 
have been notified of it beforehand. 
  "We value China in this part of the world so we will not 
antagonize its government," Romulo added.

  [Text] Zamboanga City -- An official of the Moro National 
Liberation Front said MNLF rebels, not the "Lost Command," were 
responsible for the killing of 21 Marines and four militiamen in 
an ambush in Tuburan, Basilan, on 9 February last year. 
  The announcement was made Friday [11 February] afternoon to 
the daily, THE MORNING TIMES, by a relative of MNLF Commander 
Abdulnasir Samputu Kahalum. The chief of the Marine Forces in 
southern Philippines, Brigadier General Guillermo Ruiz, 
belittled Kahalum's claim that he led the ambush. He said that, 
as far as the military is concerned, all the attackers were 
"plain criminals, not MNLF rebels." 
  "We have never had a lost command in our area; all our men 
are MNLF regulars," the man said. 
  He said the MNLF attackers in Tuburan still have the 
firearms, uniforms, boots and other belongings they took from 
the slain Marines and militiamen. 
  "If General Ruiz says Commander Kahalum did not lead the 
ambush, how come Kahalum has the Marines' things?" the informant 
said. 
  Ruiz earlier belittled the claim of Kahalum that his group 
was responsible for the massacre of the 21 Marine soldiers and 
four militiamen at Sitio [village district] Badunggan, Barangay 
[village] Candiis, Tuburan. 
  Ruiz, who now heads the government panel in the joint cease 
fire committee with the MNLF, said he did not want to drag the 
name of the MNLF into the incident. 
  "In so far as we in the armed forces are concerned, the 
attackers are all criminal elements, whatever group they belong 
to, whatever creed they profess to, whatever sect or religion, 
they are criminal elements and we have to run after them," he 
said. 
  The general's reaction came after Kahalum, in an interview 
with radio station DXLL, confessed that he led Moro fighters in 
last year's massacre. 
  Kahalum said they ambushed the Marines in "self-defense." 
  He said the Marines were guided by six volunteers of the 
Civilian Home Defense Force and were poised to attack their camp 
at Badunggan. 
  "We had no choice but to defend our camp and prove to the 
Marines that we could resist them," Kahalum told broadcaster 
Jose Mari Bue. 
  Kahalum made the confession in order to clear the names of 
Tuburan Vice Mayor Rajid Sahabat and Tuburan Councilor Alih 
Sulaiman, who have been implicated in the ambush. 
  He said his purpose was also to let the truth come out. 
  Sahabat has been hiding since the court issued a warrant for 
his arrest, saying he could not pay the P450,000 [Philippine 
pesos] bail. 
  The 31-year-old Sahabat, who has sought refuge with the MNLF 
regulars, said he will turn himself in to the authorities as 
soon as he has money for bail. 
  Sahabat said he wanted to surrender even if he had to go to 
jail but was afraid of what the Marines might do to him. 
  "I want to go back to my work as vice mayor and to prove in 
court that I'm innocent," he said. 
  Councilor Sulaiman said their being implicated in the ambush 
was politically motivated.

<F P=106> [By Raymond Burgos] </F>
  [Text] The Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa [RAM - 
Nationalist Revolutionary Alliance], a group of rightist 
military rebels, had provided a cache of various explosives to 
the leftist hit squad Alex Boncayao Brigade (ABB), a RAM leader 
has disclosed. 
  The RAM leader, who requested anonymity, yesterday said the 
cache of explosives, mostly bombs used by the Armed Forces of 
the Philippines, was given to leaders of the ABB sometime in 
1990 after the RAM and the then Manila-Rizal committee of the 
Communist Party of the Philippines agreed to enter an "informal 
united front" to topple the administration of President Corazon 
Aquino. 
  The Manila-Rizal faction of the CPP [Communist Party of the 
Philippines] led by Felimon Lagman, broke off from self-exiled 
party founder Jose Maria last year, but kept the bombs given by 
the RAM. 
  "It's possible that the explosives used by the ABB team in 
bombing the head offices of three oil companies were part of the 
cache of explosives that were given to them," the military rebel 
said. 
  The ABB had claimed responsibility for the bombing of the 
offices of Shell and Petron in Makati and Caltex in Manila in 
protest over the 28 January decision of the Energy Regulatory 
Board to increase oil prices. 
  Two security guards of Petron were wounded during the 
bombings on 1 February. The ABB the next day said it would stop 
the bomb attacks to give way to street protests against the oil 
price increase. 
  President Ramos, on the eve of a planned general strike 9 
February agreed to roll back fuel prices, triggered off by a P1 
[Philippine pesos]-per-liter oil levy but on condition 
alternative sources of revenue were found. 
  The RAM leader's disclosure that bombs were given by the 
military rebels to the ABB supports the claim by communist 
factions loyal to Sison that the ABB is capable of "terroristic 
attacks" in Metro Manila. 
  Nova Salvacion, spokesman of a group in the Manila-Rizal 
communist committee which remained loyal to Sison, has said that 
a number of the bombs given by the RAM were planted by the ABB 
in "strategic areas" between 1990 and 1991 to promote chaos and 
provoke street fighting in Metro Manila. 
  According to Salvacion, some of the planted bombs are still 
intact and could still be detonated. 
  The planned bombings at that time were aimed at creating an 
insurrectionary situation" that will lead to the collapse of the 
Aquino administration. 
  At the height of protests calling for a permanent roll back 
in fuel prices last 9 February, police discovered several home 
made bombs and C-4 blasting caps inside the Motorola compound 
along the South Superhighway in Sucat, Paranaque. 
  Police investigators, however, failed to determine whether 
the bombs were part of a terror plot timed with the 9 February 
nationwide protest. 
  They also failed to identify the group responsible for 
planting the bombs inside the Motorola compound, owned by the 
family of businessmen Raul and Jose Concepcion, who supported 
the call for a general strike. Interior Secretary Rafael Alunan 
III claimed "extremist groups" planted the bombs found in 
Paranaque. Alunan, however, did not identify the group.

  [Text] The government has raised objections to the United 
States, which has made firm its plan to initiate procedures for 
imposing sanctions against Japan on the issue of U.S. access to 
Japan's market for automobile and portable telephones. The 
government has complained that "since Japan has faithfully 
complied with agreements made with the United States, it is hard 
to understand why sanctions should be imposed," (as stated by an 
official of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications). 
Should the United States actually initiate sanctions against 
Japan, the government plans to consider taking its case to the 
GATT. However, to avoid an all-out confrontation, the 
government also plans to promptly work out a "comprehensive 
surplus-cutting and market opening program" (tentative name) to 
accelerate market opening and reduction of Japan's current 
account surplus. 
  On the afternoon of 15 February (early morning of 16 
February, Japan time), the U.S. Government, in accordance with 
Article 1377 of its Trade Act, ruled that "Japan has violated a 
bilateral accord concluded in 1989" regarding Japan's market for 
automobile and portable telephones. There has grown a strong 
likelihood that the U.S. Government will subsequently initiate 
procedures for imposing sanctions. Japan is "prepared to appeal 
to the GATT should sanctions be initiated," (as stated by 
Takakazu Kuriyama, Japanese ambassador to the United States), by 
the United States through such measures as levying punitive 
tariffs on certain Japanese items. 
  The government is also determined to reject numerical 
targets 
the U.S. Government wants Japan to accept so that the U.S. 
Motorola Inc.'s transmission system for mobile phones will 
become more widespread in Japan. Whether this system, which is 
handled by the Nippon Ido Tsushin Corporation (IDO), will become 
popular is a question that would depend on business decisions 
that private firms will make. Therefore, the government plans 
to break the deadlocked situation on the basis of discussions 
between private firms. 
  However, both Japan and the United States hope to avoid a 
"battle of reciprocal sanctions," (as stated by U.S. President 
Bill Clinton), at all costs because the entire Japanese economy 
would be seriously affected, should the United States further 
wave its "let-the-yen-rise negotiating card." 
  For this reason, the government plans to once again seek 
U.S. 
understanding of Japanese efforts by compiling a comprehensive 
program to reduce its surplus and open its markets. At a 
cabinet meeting held on the morning of 15 February, Tsutomu 
Hata, deputy prime minister and concurrently foreign minister, 
Chikara Sakaguchi, labor minister, and other ministers pointed 
out the need for such a program. The government is considering 
plans to announce this program as being undertaken at Japan's 
own initiative. 
  Details of the program will now be worked out mainly by 
relevant ministries. The program is expected to include such 
plans as stricter application of the Antimonopoly Law and 
further deregulation, in addition to the improvement in 
procedures regarding government procurement -- on which 
agreement has already been made at the Japan-U.S. framework 
trade talks. 
  Since the United States is further pressuring Japan to open 
its markets and reduce its surplus through a two-pronged 
strategy of sanctions and encouragement of yen appreciation, it 
seems Japan will have to work out its comprehensive program 
before the July summit meeting of major industrialized nations 
(Naples summit).

<F P=106> [By Yoichi Funahashi, chief of ASAHI SHIMBUN's U.S. General </F>
Bureau] 
  [Text] Japanese diplomacy has been described as a 
diplomacy of "gifts" and "apology." Maybe "private settlement" 
should be added to this. Such a description indicates the 
extent to which Japan has gone in being passive, waiting for 
outside pressure, being engrossed with pleasing its partners, 
and indulging in behind-the-scenes deals. The Japan-U.S. 
semiconductor agreement may be a classic example to illustrate 
this point. 
  However, things have changed drastically with the latest 
Japan-U.S. summit meeting. This time, Japan offered neither 
"gifts," "apologies," nor "private settlements." The two 
nations failed to reach agreement on the framework trade talks 
due to a dispute over the issue of designating "objective 
criteria" to measure progress in the opening of Japan's markets. 
Both nations were given verdicts that "it is a time for mature 
deliberation" (as stated by U.S. President Bill Clinton) and 
that "it is a time for us to cool our heads" (as stated by Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa). 
  The Japanese negotiating team feels refreshed. Apparently 
they feel a sense of satisfaction and relief as they were able 
to resist "being pressured with managed trade in the form of 
numerical targets." Even U.S. negotiators seem to have "felt 
cathartical" (as stated by a high-ranking White House official). 
  The same official has added: "Nothing can move as long as we 
have to deal with Japanese bureaucrats. Sensing it would be 
useless to go on like this, we were extremely frustrated." 
  Both the Japanese and U.S. Governments tried to give the 
impression that their relationship was undergoing a "maturing 
process" (as stated by U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher) so this relationship, as a whole, would not be 
shaken despite the breakdown in top-level trade negotiations. A 
high-ranking U.S. Government official has explained: "Although 
the United States has at times imposed sanctions against 
European nations and Canada because of trade disputes, it has 
been able to maintain basic relations with these countries. Our 
relationship with Japan has reached this stage." In other 
words, this relationship is probably one based on "gamesmanship." 
  This cannot necessarily be denied. In the United States, a 
younger generation of politicians who are intolerant of Japan's 
attitude of taking advantage of U.S. tolerance has taken control 
of politics and diplomacy. In Japan, the idea that Japan should 
say what it has to say to the United States and maintain a firm 
attitude so as to come up to the expectations of other Asian 
countries is spreading among its leaders. Both nations have 
begun to think about whether they can somehow have more 
business-like relations with each other. It certainly is 
necessary for the two nations to broaden the scope and context 
of their relationship by outgrowing their excessive bilateralism 
under which they look at each other from the opposite ends of a 
telescope. 
  Nevertheless, the latest "cathartical diplomacy" between 
Japan and the United States lays bare the uncertainty of 
post-Cold War relations between the two nations. 
  There was almost no coordination of macroeconomic measures 
to 
maintain economic growth, while microeconomic measures to deal 
with sectoral trade issues stood out. The idea of "Japan-U.S. 
cooperation on a global scale" regresses as the United States 
sticks firmly to its inward-looking stance. While Japan and the 
United States call for a promotion of an open regionalism for 
the Asia-Pacific region, both of the all-important nations 
continue to engage in their chronic trade conflicts. 
  The Clinton administration has its own "internal problems" 
to 
worry about. Since it pushed through the enactment of the North 
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) against opposition by big 
labor unions, it has had to secure concessions from Japan at 
bilateral trade negotiations that would keep the labor unions 
happy. It would not be a bad idea to take a hard-line stance 
toward Japan to wipe away the administration's image of 
"diplomatic weakness" built up by its faulty handling of the 
Bosnian conflict and other issues. 
  At the latest framework trade talks, the U.S. Government 
decided that "everyone would sing the same song" (as stated by 
U.S. Senator John D. Rockefeller IV). During the Cold War era, 
such U.S. Government agencies as the White House's National 
Security Council (NSC) and the State Department played the role 
of trying to keep trade conflicts from intensifying. This time, 
however, they closed ranks with the Government's economic and 
trade departments and agencies to avoid causing utter confusion. 
It seems as if the United States considers Japan in the same 
way it previously considered the former Soviet Union. 
  Above all, what is significant is ideological fluctuation. 
One high-ranking White House official has said: "One of the 
reasons the trade negotiations broke down is that Japan made a 
caricature" of the framework trade talks as if it were a 
confrontation between the United States, which advocates managed 
trade, and Japan, which champions free trade. 
  Meanwhile, Japan has a mass of "internal problems" to 
deal with. But, in the series of trade talks with the United 
States, Japanese bureaucrats particularly came under fire. 
  On the eve of the summit talks, President Clinton read such 
books by Prime Minister Hosokawa as There Will Be No 
Tomorrow [Ashita-wa Gozanaku-soro] and a compilation of 
Hosokawa's past comments translated into English, entitled "The 
Time To Act Is Now." Clinton reportedly showed great interest 
in Hosokawa's call for reforming the Japanese bureaucratic 
system, and revealed to his close aides his intention to support 
the prime minister in his struggle against bureaucrats. 
  The "breakdown" in the trade negotiations may have resulted 
from Japanese bureaucrats' reaction to such a Japan-U.S. 
partnership toward reforming the bureaucratic system. In this 
connection, it is suspected that bureaucrats may have skillfully 
manipulated nationalistic feelings. 
  Japan-U.S. relations can probably mature only after the two 
nations carry out their respective reform programs broadly, 
deeply, and swiftly. It is too early to speak of maturity at 
this stage.

<F P=106> [Article by U Chong-chang: "Is There a Change in Kim </F>
Chong-il's Health?"] 
  [Text] It was learned that North Korean President Kim 
Il-song's son, Kim Chong-il, has critically damaged his brain. 
According to information obtained from China in mid-January, our 
intelligence agency said: "Kim Chong-il was in a traffic 
accident around September 1993. He is in critical condition, 
with broken bones and brain damage." 
  This information was obtained by an official of the National 
Unification Board [NUB] through a researcher of a Chinese 
strategic institute when they participated in a seminar on 
Northeast Asian affairs held in the United States. The Chinese 
researcher said that he heard of such news from a friend with 
whom he served in the Army and who is currently working at the 
Chinese Embassy in Pyongyang and from a friend from school. 
  The content of the information conveyed by the Chinese 
researcher is as follows: "Kim Chong-il, who is a speed demon, 
was in a traffic accident while driving his car at high speed. 
Kim damaged his brain and his bones were broken. North Korea 
invited Chinese experts who can read X-rays well as well as 
brain surgeons. However, the North Korean side did not allow 
the Chinese doctors to see the patient. They returned to China 
after saying they could not make a diagnosis without seeing the 
patient." 
  Related agencies including the NUB and the Agency for 
National Security Planning [NSP] are currently analyzing this in 
detail. A related source said: "As a result of monitoring 
North Korea's various media, unusual signs are appearing 
surrounding Kim Chong-il such as the reduction in the number of 
teachings being carried out under his name. It seems definite 
that there is a change in Kim Chong-il's health." 
  There is additional evidence that there is a "great change" 
in Kim Chong-il's health. U.S. evangelist Billy Graham, who 
recently visited Pyongyang to hold a revival service, said: 
"What was most surprising about my visit to Pyongyang this time 
was the fact that Kim Chong-il had disappeared from view." 
  According to Rev. Graham, when he visited Pyongyang in 1992 
Kim Il-song said to him: "Kim Chong-il is in charge of 
everything and I am standing at the second line." However, when 
he asked Kim Il-song about Kim Chong-il this time, Graham says 
he intentionally avoided the question. Billy Graham expressed 
his will to meet Kim Chong-il by saying: "I have a gift for Kim 
Chong-il." However, Kim Il-song changed the subject, Graham 
said. 
  An expert in South-North affairs said: "In the phrases `the 
great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il' which are being used commonly, the phrase `the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il' has been gradually disappearing 
since September 1993. This shows that there is a change in Kim 
Chong-il's succession system." 
  A scholar on the issue of the reunification of the Korean 
peninsula said: "Viewing from various signs within North Korea, 
it seems that Kim Chong-il will face a change in his health 
before Kim Il-song. Now is the time to closely observe how Kim 
Chong-il's death will influence South-North relations." 
  An NSP official concerned says: "As far as we know, there 
seems to be something wrong with Kim Chong-il's cardiac system." 
He still insists that this is "intelligence" [choppo], not 
"information" [chongbo]. This official also said: "A heart 
specialist from Lyon University in Paris secretly visited 
Pyongyang in March 1991 and performed surgery to install a heart 
pacemaker." He went on to say: "At that time, Western 
intelligence agencies believed only Kim Il-song could afford 
such expensive surgery and paid attention to the physical 
checkup of Kim Il-song, an old man. However, Kim Chong-il seems 
to be the person who underwent the surgery." 
  This is not the first time that it was speculated something 
had happened to Kim Chong-il. Moscow radio reported in June 
1993: "Kim Il-song strongly reproached his son, Kim Chong-il, 
and Kim Chong-il was hospitalized for a shock from this." 
  At about the same time, Russia's ITAR-TASS carried a similar 
report under the headline "Kim Chong-il's Health Conditions." 
ITAR-TASS also carried this report in the ASIAN BULLETIN, which 
is distributed to Russian Government agencies and research 
institutes. 
  The report says: "Kim Il-song has recently strongly 
reproached Kim Chong-il, his son and heir apparent, for his 
mistakes in the handling of state affairs. As a result, Kim 
Chong-il suffered a nervous breakdown and could not carry out 
his official duties for two months." This episode immediately 
followed the "rumors that Kim Chong-il fell from a horse." It 
was said that during a horse ride, Kim Chong-il fell from the 
horse and suffered a serious head injury. Upon receiving this 
information, our intelligence agency closely examined Kim 
Chong-il's appearances on Pyongyang television. The agency 
found out that Kim Chong-il barely used his left arm in official 
functions. 
  An aide to Kim Chong-il, who contacted our side's official 
concerned in Beijing, China, said: "It is true that Kim 
Chong-il was injured when he fell from a horse. He was not 
injured in the head but slightly injured in the arms." 
  A little while later, Kim Song-ae, who had disappeared for 
some time, suddenly appeared at an official function and 
demonstrated that she is all right. Kim Song-ae is Kim 
Chong-il's stepmother and Kim Pyong-il's mother. Kim Song-ae 
and Kim Chong-il are on hostile terms. 
  Our side's agency concerned says: "When Cambodia's Sihanouk 
arrived in North Korea on 22 July 1993, Kim Song-ae appeared at 
the Pyongyang airport to receive Sihanouk. Kim Song-ae appeared 
at an official function to welcome a foreign state guest for the 
first time since she had disappeared from the public. This 
means Kim Song-ae regained her past authority." 
  What is also drawing our attention along with the rise of 
Kim Song-ae is the change in the status of Kim Yong-chu and Kim 
Pyong-il. Kim Il-song's younger brother Kim Yong-chu "lived in 
exile" for 18 years in North Hamgyong Province but was suddenly 
appointed to vice president in early December 1993. While 
serving as ambassador to Bulgaria, Kim Pyong-il was summoned in 
1992. Since then his whereabouts had been vague. However, it 
was learned around early December 1993 that he was in good 
health and living in Pyongyang. 
  It is a widely known fact that Kim Chong-il and his half 
brother Kim Pyong-il do not get along well. According to a Mr. 
Kang who defected to the ROK from North Korea, Kim Chong-il 
injured his arm when Kim Pyong-il shot him with a gun. Mr. Kang 
said that he heard of such an incident when he visited Pyongyang 
in April 1990 from his uncle who works for a government agency. 
When Kim Pyong-il temporarily returned home while serving as 
ambassador to Bulgaria in early 1990, his mother Kim Song-ae 
said to him: "Kim Chong-il is treating me harshly by saying that 
I am his step-mother." When Kim Pyong-il heard this he got very 
angry and fired a shot at Kim Chong-il, but it only hit his arm. 
  The rise of Kim Yong-chu, Kim Song-ae, and Kim Pyong-il go 
hand-in-hand with the signs of change in Kim Chong-il's health. 
Since September 1993, when it was learned that Kim Chong-il 
suffered brain damage in the traffic accident, Kim Yong-chu who 
was alienated, advanced to the core of the power structure. 
Also for Kim Song-ae to appear at an official meeting was not a 
common matter. It was learned that after an interval in his 
activities since ending his position as ambassador to Bulgaria, 
it was tentatively decided that Kim Pyong-il will assume the 
position of ambassador to Finland. 
  An official of the NSP said: "Absolute power is bound to be 
concentrated in one person. The dispersion of power shows that 
there has been a change in Kim Chong-il's succession system. 
Also, it seems that lining up Kim Il-song's family to the core 
of the power structure is a measure to prepare for an 
`unavoidable circumstance' within the family." 
  In connection with Kim Chong-il's position, it is noteworthy 
to see changes in North Korea's "Room No. 39." "Room No. 39." 
is a secretariat for Kim Chong-il. The agency concerned 
speculates that "Room No. 39," which used to be an office of the 
Finance Ministry under the party center (refers to Kim 
Chong-il), was disbanded recently and that it was merged into 
the Organization Department [chojikpu]. "Room No. 39" has been 
a channel for ROK business corporations' advance into North 
Korea. Therefore, they pay particular attention to changes in 
Kim Chong-il's position and the fate of "Room No. 39." 
  Via Japanese media, North Korea has recently released a 
photograph of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il with Mt. Paektu in 
the background. The photograph shows Kim Chong-il on top of Mt. 
Paektu in the winter wearing ordinary clothes. Why did North 
Korea suddenly release such a photograph? 
  A Chongwadae [presidential residence] official concerned 
says: "North-South relations will undergo momentous changes some 
time this year at the earliest, or next year at the latest." He 
also says: "Those changes will be made in a direction favorable 
to us."

  [Text] Beijing, Feb. 17 (YONHAP) -- Kim Chong-il, the son 
of and heir to Kim Il-song, has recently been rebuked by his 
father over Pyongyang's nuclear policy and has since been 
refraining from appearing in public scenes, a source here in 
Beijing said on Thursday. 
  The source well versed with North Korea's internal affairs 
said this is why he has been staying away from various recent 
public gatherings designed to mark his 52nd birthday on Feb. 16, 
one of major North Korean national holidays. The junior Kim is 
known to have been managing day-to-day state affairs on behalf 
of his aging father for years. 
  "It has been learned that the senior Kim reprimanded his son 
for engineering Pyongyang's nuclear policy in a hardline 
direction, a policy which has made North Korea's position very 
difficult," the source said. 
  As Kim Il-song has lately been raising his voice in major 
policies and as nuclear talks with the United States were 
progressing, Kim Chong-il voluntarily chose to be on his good 
behavior, the source said. He was quick to add, however, that 
this does not mean that Kim Chong-il's position as the future 
ruler has been shaken. The junior Kim enjoys a broad power base 
built elaborately in the party, administration and military, the 
source said. Yet, he said, it is true that moderate people with 
Kim Il-song in the center, who advocate the resolution of the 
nuclear question through negotiations, are rising fast in North 
Korea today. 
  The source also showed skepticism over various rumors 
surrounding the junior Kim, saying none of such rumors could be 
verified. The rumors include an alleged brain damage he 
suffered in a traffic accident last autumn and his being in an 
awkward position over the uncovery of his misuse of a large 
amount of foreign exchanges.

  [Excerpt] The private visit of Taiwanese President Li 
Teng-hui has triggered strong reaction from the Chinese 
Government. On 16 February, the Chinese Government reportedly 
issued a protest note, accusing Thailand of violating the 
agreement and understanding between each other on the one-China 
policy and emphasizing its strong regret on the matter. 
  The note was issued after the Taiwanese president's visit to 
Thailand, which took place between 14 and 16 February during 
which the Thai Government organized a reception in Phuket. 
Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai was at the reception, played golf, 
as well as discussed economic cooperation with the visitor. 
  Thailand was the last leg of President Li's visit to the 
region. He was in the Philippines and Indonesia and was received 
by Presidents Fidel Ramos and Suharto despite the Chinese 
Government's charge that the visit would affect its relations 
with those countries. The Chinese Government issued two protest 
notes to the two countries and canceled a visit of Chinese 
parliamentary foreign affairs committee to those countries. 
  The Chinese Government resorted to the same two practices 
vis 
a vis Thailand. There was a reminder from the Chinese foreign 
minister. The Thai Government, however, viewed the Taiwanese 
president's visit as private to "rest for three days to play 
golf." 
  In any event, China has made an initial protest by canceling 
indefinitely an official visit by an NPC foreign affairs 
delegation, originally scheduled for 23 February-1 March. A 
protest note also followed. 
  Meanwhile, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai told reporters that 
Thailand firmly abided by its one-China policy and that the 
Taiwanese president's visit would not affect that policy. He 
said the Thai Government should be able to practice a basic 
principle in the conduct of its fully independent foreign policy. 
  China and Thailand established diplomatic relations in 1975, 
and Thailand ceased diplomatic relations with Taiwan, which 
China regards as one of its provinces. 
  In any event, it was reported that on 16 February the king 
hosted a dinner for the Taiwanese president at Phuphing Palace, 
Chiang Mai Province. Prime Minister Chuan Likphai was present 
at the dinner. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Dear friends: Mrs. Ho The Lan, spokeswoman for the 
Vietnamese Foreign Ministry, held a regular news conference in 
Hanoi this afternoon with a large number of local and foreign 
correspondents in attendance. 
  The REUTER, AP, ABC, NIKKEI, and YOMIURI SHIMBUN 
correspondents raised questions about the timing, venue, and 
level of the forthcoming Vietnamese-U.S. talks on the issue of 
financial claims and about any other issues that will be 
discussed at these talks. The REUTER correspondent asked another 
question about the reason for the postponement of the talks on 
financial claims and about when the two sides would discuss the 
opening of liaison offices. In reply, Mrs. Ho The Lan said: 
  It is true that Vietnam and the United States had initially 
planned to discuss mutual financial claims on 15-16 February. 
But as Mr. Le Mai clearly stated at his 4 February news 
conference, with President Bill Clinton's declaration lifting 
the embargo against Vietnam, and with his proposal to exchange 
liaison offices between the two countries, new issues have 
arisen that need to be discussed by both sides. The talks must 
therefore be postponed for some time to allow for better 
preparation. The issue of financial claims and the setting up 
of liaison offices in Hanoi and Washington will certainly be 
included on the agenda of the upcoming talks. We have thus far 
only agreed that Hanoi will be the venue for the talks. I will 
inform you of the timing when an agreement is reached. 
  To a question raised by the REUTER and AP correspondents 
about when Vietnam and the United States will begin their talks 
on human rights, Mrs. Ho The Lan said: 
  Vietnam advocates holding dialogues with all countries, 
including the United States, on matters of mutual concern, 
including the human rights issue. As for how much progress has 
been made in connection with the dialogue on human rights, we 
have reached a general understanding that such a dialogue will 
be an exchange of views based of equality, mutual respect, and 
noninterference in each other's internal affairs. It is on this 
basis that Vietnam and the United States have agreed to meet to 
discuss matters of mutual concern, including the human rights 
issue -- in the near future in New York or Washington -- to 
understand each other's positions better. By the way, I would 
like to reassert it is Vietnam's policy to attach importance to 
relations with the United States and to wish for normal 
relations between the two countries on the basis of respect for 
each other's independence and sovereignty, noninterference in 
each other's internal affairs, equality, and mutual benefit. 
During their previous talks, both the United States and Vietnam 
came to understand that the goodwill and efforts of both sides 
will determine whether or not obstacles arise in the path of 
normalized relations between the two countries. The two sides 
also unanimously held that no political conditions should be 
attached to the normalization of relations between Vietnam and 
the United States. 
  The BANGKOK POST correspondent asked whether Vietnam saw any 
prospects for differences over the Spratly and Paracel 
archipelagoes being settled through preventive diplomacy, in 
view of the 16 February Bangkok seminar on preventive diplomacy 
held between the ASEAN countries and their interlocutors with UN 
participation. Mrs. Ho The Lan said: 
  The Paracel and Spratly archipelagoes are under Vietnamese 
sovereignty. We advocate settling all disputes through peaceful 
negotiations. This conforms to the general trend of the 
countries in the region. We believe that all differences can be 
settled through negotiation and diplomacy. 
  The QUAN DOI NHAN DAN correspondent said that according to 
the Chinese press and Radio Australia, China has sent two 
research ships to the Spratly archipelago to explore for oil. 
The correspondent asked if the Vietnamese side had any comment 
on this. Mrs. Ho The Lan said: 
  Time and again, we have affirmed that the Spratly and 
Paracel 
archipelagoes are Vietnamese territory. Any foreign oil 
exploration in the Spratly archipelago area or on Vietnam's 
continental shelf without Vietnam's permission or approval 
amounts to a violation of Vietnam's sovereignty and other 
rights. This incident is at variance with an agreement reached 
between the two countries that both sides should refrain from 
doing anything that may further complicate the situation while 
they conduct negotiations to settle problems in the Eastern Sea. 
  Answering a question from the ITAR-TASS correspondent 
regarding Vietnam's observation of the results of the Geneva 
conference on Indochinese refugees, Mrs. Ho The Lan said: 
  We have expressed our stance on several occasions regarding 
the repatriation of Vietnamese refugees still stranded in 
first-asylum countries. I would like to reiterate that the 
Vietnamese Government is ready to hold talks with all parties 
concerned to take back refugees whose applications for 
resettlement in third countries are turned down. Such 
repatriation must be carried out on the basis of willingness; 
respect for human dignity; and guarantees of safety, 
orderliness, and the necessary international financial 
assistance so that returnees can gradually stabilize their lives 
after returning to Vietnam. In this spirit, we have been 
cooperating and are currently cooperating effectively with the 
High Commissioner for Refugees and other parties concerned to 
help complete the repatriation program by the end of 1995. 
  Asked by the ITAR-TASS correspondent about Vietnam's 
reaction 
to the possible NATO bombing of Sarajevo in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
Mrs. Ho The Lan said: 
  We hope that the Sarajevo issue will be settled through 
peaceful negotiations among the warring factions. We do not 
believe that bombing will bring peace to that country or 
stability to the Balkan region. 
  [Hanoi VNA in English at 1445 GMT on 17 February in a 
similar 
report adds: "On news about whether Japanese Prime Minister 
Hosokawa would visit Vietnam, Mrs Lan said: Vietnam has not 
received such news through official channel. However if the 
Japanese prime minister plans to visit this year, he is welcome 
and Vietnam considers it an important event in the development 
of the friendship and cooperation between the two countries. 
Mrs Lan rejected the news that Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet was 
going to visit Indonesia and to meet with Taiwan's president in 
Bali."]

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 16 KYODO -- President Bill Clinton 
said Wednesday [16 February] he expects to have policy 
recommendations drawn up in the next few days to address trade 
disputes with Japan. 
  Clinton failed to resolve differences with Japanese Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa during a summit meeting last Friday 
over U.S. demands for reducing Japan's trade surplus and 
increasing the sale of foreign goods in Japan. "Ever since the 
talks I had with Prime Minister Hosokawa, we've been reviewing 
our options, consulting with our friends, trying to assess what 
course we ought to take," Clinton said. 
  "I think sometime in the next few days, my economic team... 
[ellipses as received] and our national security team will come 
back with a set of options and recommendations to me and then 
I'll have something to say," he told reporters during a White 
House ceremony announcing a 6 billion dollar sale of civilian 
aircraft to Saudi Arabia. 
  Clinton said the policy measures under review are different 
from the sanctions the U.S. Government announced Tuesday over a 
dispute with Japan on access to the Japanese cellular phone 
market. "That's an issue of longstanding development," he said. 
  The policy options under consideration reportedly include 
the 
resurrection of a U.S. trade law that allows punitive measures 
against countries which refuse to change what Washington deems 
unfair trade practices. 
  U.S. press reports said a White House decision to revive the 
"Super 301" trade measure through executive order is imminent, 
possibly by Thursday. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown said the 
White House has made no decision on the "Super 301" measure but 
predicted that Clinton will take some kind of action against 
Japan. 
  "We are absolutely bound to act. We are reviewing options 
now," Brown said in a television interview. 
  Asked about the possibility of a trade war with Japan, Brown 
said, "We don't even like to use that kind of language." Brown 
said the United States is faced with "a very difficult 
situation" but reiterated that the Clinton administration is 
determined to "open (Japanese) markets to American goods, 
products and services." 
  "We're going to do everything we can to get that done." He 
said. "We have said to Japan, `we have to have measurable, 
monitorable results. Your markets must be opened because 
American exports mean American jobs.'"

  The memorandum reads in full: 
  It is a worldwide-known fact that the successive rulers in 
South Korea have long carried forward their clandestine 
programme for the development of nuclear weapons under the U.S. 
"nuclear umbrella." 
  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea issued its memorandum early last year, 
disclosing South Korea's nuclear weapons development programme. 
  Many governments, political parties, public organizations 
and 
the world community at large have expressed great concern over 
the South Korean authorities' machinations for nuclear weapons 
development and demanded their immediate discontinuation. 
  This notwithstanding, the South Korean authorities have 
refused to comply with this demand and stepped up their nuclear 
weapons development at accelerated pace. 
  In connection with another revelation of the fact that the 
South Korean authorities have recently increased plutonium 
output from their pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR) for the 
development of nuclear weapons, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is issuing this 
memorandum, considering it necessary to disclose the true 
picture thereof. 
<H3>  I. The South Korean Authorities' Nuclear Weapons 
Development Policy and Introduction of PHWR </H3>
  South Korea's nuclear weapons development policy was shaped 
in the early 1970s. 
  The 1960s witnessed a rapid collapse of the imperialists' 
colonial system in different parts of the world, that gave way 
to a chain of the declaration of independence by countries under 
the colonial domination. In the 1970s, the suzerain states 
moved toward withdrawing their troops from their former colonies. 
  Critically ill at ease over these moves, the former dictator 
Pak Chong-hui tried to find a way out in developing nuclear 
weapons. 
  A former aide close to the "Chongwadae" [presidential 
office] 
testified that Pak Chong-hui "concluded that the last resort for 
self-reliant national defence capability is the acquisition of 
nuclear weapons." (South Korean monthly magazine SINDONG-A, 
April issue of 1989). 
  Recalling this period, a South Korean newspaper reported 
that 
"with all testimonies pieced together, Pak Chong-hui seemed to 
have taken a `shortcut' toward the acquisition of nuclear 
weapons by the mid-1970s." (South Korean newspaper CHUNGANG 
ILBO, August 6, 1992) 
  As Pak Chong-hui committed himself to the nuclear 
development 
policy, his primary preoccupation was to obtain access to the 
nuclear explosive substances and introduce the PHWR to this end. 
  The South Korean monthly magazine WOLGAN CHOSON in its 
August 
issue of 1988 commented that "Pak Chong-hui forcefully 
suppressed the anti-PHWR voice within his `government' and 
ordered Chairman Mun Chung-sik of the `Korea Electric Power 
Corporation' (KEPCO) to resolutely push forward the introduction 
of the PHWR. This seemed to reflect his preoccupation with the 
nuclear arms development". 
  The same magazine in its October issue of 1991 wrote that "a 
person, once deeply engaged in the nuclear development 
programme, admitted that the introduction of the Wolsong PHWR 
from Canada was aimed at manufacturing nuclear weapons." 
  Even a physicist who remembers the PHWR introduction 
asserted 
that "the PHWR introduction is apparently related to the nuclear 
weapons development." (South Korean monthly magazine SINDONG-A, 
April issue of 1989). 
  South Korea embarked on a pilot-production of nuclear 
weapons through PHWR as early as in the late 1970s. These 
attempts by South Korea to develop nuclear weapons escalated 
during the years of the Chon Tu-hwan "regime". 
  On December 19, 1980, Chon Tu-hwan took the "measure of 
merging and dissolving the `government-subsidized agencies,'" a 
camouflage to feign the abandonment of nuclear weapons 
development scheme, but in fact "maximized their research 
capability." (South Korean YONHAP yearbook, 1981 edition) 
  In September 1983, Yi Ki-paek, the then "chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff of the `ROK' Army", submitted his "verbal 
report on the nuclear policy" of South Korea to Chon Tu-hwan, 
and this was the occasion for the evolution of the "secretly 
planned strategy for nuclear arms option," which has since been 
vigorously promoted". (South Korean monthly magazine WOLGAN 
CHOSON, October issue of 1991) 
  Under the cloak of the "localization of nuclear fuel," the 
Chon Tu-hwan military "regime" succeeded in developing the PHWR 
nuclear fuel in 1986 and completed its experimental facilities 
for processing the PHWR nuclear fuel in 1987. This process has 
enabled the "regime" to move toward the goal of an independent 
capability of producing the total amount of nuclear fuel needed 
for the Wolsong PHWR and at the same time toward the stage of 
perfecting the technology of reprocessing the spent fuel. 
  The No Tae-u military "regime" stepped into a full-scale 
stage of achieving a greater practicability of the industrial 
foundation of its nuclear weapons development programme by 
completing this foundation. 
  Stressing the need to "actively meet the fast-changing 
situation", No Tae-u had the "Taedok Declaration" adopted 
pledging to complete by 1992 the project of the "Taedok science 
town", general headquarters of the nuclear weapons development 
programme, 4 or 5 years ahead of schedule, and on November 27, 
1992 he officiated at the dedication ceremony of the town 
project. (South Korean DONG-A yearbook, 1991 edition, MBC 
television, November 27, 1992) 
  Throughout the process of their nuclear weapons development, 
the present South Korean authorities attempted to divert the 
world public attention from their telltale nuclear arms 
programme under the cloak of the light water reactors (LWR) 
system. 
  In face of the mounting international public opinion against 
South Korea's increasing moves towards nuclear weapons 
development, Kim Yong-sam tried to whitewash such moves, saying 
that they "have no intention at all to go ahead with any 
independent nuclear weapons development programme". (South 
Korean Radio No. 1, November 14, 1993) 
  South Korean authorities' decision to introduce the PHWR was 
"motivated by the analysis which indicates a higher purity of 
plutonium from the reprocessed natural uranium as compared with 
the spent enriched uranium." (South Korean monthly magazine 
WOLGAN CHOSON, April issue of 1992). 
  The South Korean monthly magazine WOLGAN CHOSON in its 
November issue of 1989 quoted the chairman of South Korea's 
non-governmental "Council for Atomic Power Development and 
Safety" as saying in the early 1970s that "the Canadian 
Deuterium-Uranium (CANDU)-type PHWR is fuelled by natural 
uranium, which we can supply on our own". 
  The PHWR introduction is also aimed at circumventing the 
supervision by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  A South Korean physicist who remembers the period of the 
PHWR 
introduction confessed that "the IAEA's supervision is almost 
difficult, because the PHWR leaves room for a random fuel 
discharge." (South Korean monthly magazine SINDONG-A, April 
issue of 1989) 
  As seen in the above, the Wolsong PHWR is a pile geared to 
plutonium production which the South Korean authorities have 
commissioned into operation in pursuit of their policy intention 
to develop nuclear weapons. 
<H3>  II. The Stockpiling of Plutonium Through the PHWR and 
Completion of System for the Full-Scale Nuclear Weapons 
Development </H3>
  The Wolsong PHWR plays a pivotal role in the South Korean 
authorities' nuclear weapons development programme. Under a 
South Korean-Canadian December 1974 contract, the Wolsong PHWR 
project began in January 1976 and went into operation in April 
1983. 
  At present, South Korea has the Wolsong PHWR, the 
multi-purpose research reactors (K-NRR) and post irradiation 
test facilities in operation as an integral centre of the 
plutonium production. 
  The amount of nuclear material from a 1,000 MWe [megawatts 
electric] PHWR after one year operation is enough to manufacture 
around 50 atomic bombs of Nagasaki type. 
  Therefore, it follows that the 678.7 MWe PHWR operating in 
South Korea since 1983 has by now produced potential plutonium 
enough to manufacture over 370 atomic bombs. 
  The U.S. newspaper INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE on November 
2, 1993 said that South Korea is speeding up its ambitious 
nuclear programme under IAEA "safeguards," and further wrote 
that "experts estimate that its accumulated spent fuel would 
yield about 10 tons of plutonium if reprocessed. This stockpile 
of potential plutonium will increase to an estimated 24 tons by 
the year 2,000." 
  This was pointed out also by the Japanese magazine SEKAI in 
its December issue of 1992, which reported that South Korea has 
stockpiled about 10 tons of plutonium extracted from the spent 
fuel. 
  Quite obvious is how much the stockpile of plutonium will 
bulk up, when another PHWR now under construction is 
commissioned into operation. 
  South Korea is speeding up its projects to build more PHWRs 
in an effort to extract more plutonium under the pretext of 
reprocessing 300 tons of spent fuel annually discharged from 
eight LWRs currently in operation plus 1,140 tons of spent fuel 
contained in underwater storage to be recycled back into these 
PHWRs. 
  Commenting on this, South Korean newspaper HANGYORE SINMUN 
reported on March 15, 1990 that the South Korean authorities 
were planning to recycle the LWR spent fuel into low-enriched 
PHWR fuel blended with other uranium waste, a move "implicative 
of their military consideration reflected by their intention to 
build more PHWR power plants that allow an easier extraction of 
plutonium." 
  Peter Hayes, an anti-nuclear activist, wrote in his essay, 
entitled "The Republic of Korea and the Nuclear Issue," that "it 
is evident that the South Koreans have not abandoned the idea of 
reprocessing their spent fuel. In October, 1989, South Korea 
began informal discussions to organize a trilateral arrangement 
involving South Korea, the United States, and Canada, whereby 
coprocessing would be established in South Korea. 
  "Also in October, 1989 an IAEA seminar in Vienna was told by 
a KEPCO official that South Korea wants to install more PHWRs. 
A South Korean official added at the same meeting that South 
Korea would like to reprocess LWR spent fuel for recycling 
plutonium back into these PHWRs." 
  The point at issue is that the spent nuclear fuel from the 
PHWR is diverted directly into manufacturing nuclear weapons 
after its conversion into plutonium through the undisclosed 
reprocessing facility at the "Taedok science town." 
<H5>  III. The PHWRs Must Be Replaced By the LWRs </H5>
  The South Korean authorities have given the United States 
carte blanche to deploy numerous nuclear weapons in South Korea 
and meanwhile, on their part, actively pushed ahead with their 
own nuclear weapons development programme, and they are planning 
these days to introduce even "Patriot" missiles. 
  This graphically testifies to a sheer incongruity of their 
words and deeds, allegedly devoted to the implementation of the 
"joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula". 
  Now, South Korea is practically moving toward invalidating 
the "joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula". 
  In this regard, an American scholar Selig S. Harrison wrote 
in his comment that "criticism of the agreement has intensified 
in South Korea since Mr. No left office. One of the key 
advisers to President Kim Yong-sam, Chong Chae-mun, chairman of 
the `National Assembly's Foreign Affairs and Unification 
Committee' has called for a review of the 1991 agreement. `We 
know that we could generate nuclear power at a lower cost if we 
have reprocessing facilities,' Mr. Chong said last May, `and we 
cannot continue to depend on foreign countries for nuclear 
fuel.'" (U.S. newspaper INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE, November 
2, 1993). 
  The increasingly undisguised efforts on the part of the 
South 
Korean authorities to invalidate the "joint declaration on the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" have further 
intensified recently, simultaneously with the on-going ruckus 
over the DPRK's so-called `suspected nuclear programme'. 
  South Korea's former "Minister of National Unification" Yi 
Se-ki said in April 1993 that "the `North-South joint 
declaration on the denuclearization' has been invalidated in 
principle," and went the length of insisting that "it is high 
time we have to acquire nuclear weapons capability, and the 
`National Assembly' should raise voice calling for this." (South 
Korean newspaper TONG-A ILBO, April 11, 1993). 
  South Korean "MBC Television" reported on October 9, 1993 
that some observers speculated that Kim Yong-sam called a 
"security-related ministers' meeting," unusually attended by the 
"minister of science and technology," and the meeting discussed 
matters related to the "acquisition of nuclear fuel reprocessing 
facilities" and to the "review of the `declaration on the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.'" 
  It has become a stark fact that the persistent dustup by the 
South Korean authorities over the DPRK's so-called "suspected 
nuclear programme" is, after all, intended to justify their 
attempts to develop nuclear weapons. 
  Commenting on this, the Romanian weekly EUROPA in its 
edition 
No. 152 disclosed that "the South Korean authorities' kickup 
over the North's `suspected nuclear programme' is part of their 
propaganda offensive to legalize their own nuclear weapons 
development." 
  The Canada-based overseas Koreans' newspaper NEW KOREA TIMES 
commented on October 23, 1993 that "particularly, the voice of 
the new right-wing forces in South Korea calling for the 
possession of nuclear weapons was high in intensity and the 
opposition response was no less tough. As if reflecting such 
pros and cons, South Korea's nuclear independence turned out to 
be a favorite topic in the `National Assembly' as well". 
  These facts alone suffice to show that the South Korean 
authorities are dashing headlong toward nuclear weapons 
development, unconcerned with the "joint declaration on the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula," which they have now 
rendered worthless. 
  The South Korean authorities must renounce their "nuclear 
weapons development policy" for the denuclearisation of the 
Korean peninsula, remove the nuclear materials they have already 
produced or brought from other countries, and take urgent 
measures either to dismantle their PHWRs both in operation and 
under construction or to replace them with LWRs.

<F P=106> [Foreign Ministry Memorandum: "The True Picture Concerning </F>
the Production of Plutonium From PHWRs in South Korea"] 
  [Text] The DPRK Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 18 February 
issued a memorandum exposing the true picture of secret nuclear 
development in South Korea where plutonium output from 
pressurized heavy water reactors [PHWR's] [chungsuro] has been 
increasing recently. 
  The memorandum reads in full: 
  It is a fact known worldwide that the successive rulers in 
South Korea have long carried forward their clandestine program

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 18 (KCNA) -- Students in Kwangju 
and Taegu Thursday staged powerful anti-U.S. demonstrations, 
according to a South Korean radio report. 
  More than 300 students in Kwangju in their anti-U.S. protest 
in front of the "American Centre", charged that the United 
States was whipping up the atmosphere of war on the Korean 
peninsula, increasing pressure on the North over the "nuclear 
issue". 
  They strongly demanded that the United States stop 
pressuring 
the North for nuclear inspection and the "Team Spirit" joint 
military exercises. 
  The protesters threw a hundred bottles of paint and rocks at 
the "American Centre" in the fierce demonstration. 
  On the same day about fifty students rushed to the "American 
Centre" in Taegu and staged a surprise anti-U.S. demonstration 
shouting "we oppose the United States increasing tensions on the 
Korean peninsula" and pelting scores of paint cans at the 
building.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: "Just Struggle"] </F>
  [Text] According to a radio report from Seoul, students 
staged strong anti-U.S. demonstrations in Kwangju and Taegu on 
the morning of 17 February. Approximately 300 university 
students in Kwangju district staged anti-U.S. demonstrations in 
front of the American Center in Yangnim-tong, So-ku, Kwangju 
City. The students denounced the United States for recently 
strengthening pressure on the North regarding the nuclear issue 
and for creating a war atmosphere on the Korean peninsula. The 
university students strongly urged the United States to stop 
pressuring the North on the nuclear inspection issue and to 
discontinue the Team Spirit joint military exercise. 
  It is said that the furious students threw approximately 100 
paint bombs and stones at the American Center and staged strong 
demonstrations. 
  In addition, approximately 50 university students rushed to 
the American Center in Taegu City and staged a surprise 
anti-U.S. demonstration. According to the radio report, the 
students threw dozens of paint bombs at the American Center, 
while chanting the slogan: "We oppose the United States 
aggravating tension on the Korean peninsula." 
  The South Korean youth and students stage very justifiable 
struggles to prevent the war danger developing on the Korean 
peninsula, to establish durable peace, and to realize the 
independent and peaceful reunification of the country. 
  As everyone knows, even though half a century has passed 
since our country was divided, our country has not been 
reunified. The danger of war -- not durable peace -- has been 
further increased on the Korean peninsula. This is because the 
United States has occupied South Korea and has run wild to bring 
about a new war. 
  If the United States did not bring approximately 1,000 
nuclear weapons of all kinds into South Korea, the nuclear issue 
on the Korean peninsula would not arise. If the United States 
did not deploy tens of thousands of aggression forces in South 
Korea and did not run wild to bring about a new war, the 
situation of our country would not be tense. 
  Worse still, the United States has been putting pressure on 
us to accept nuclear inspections and has openly revealed the 
inner intention to conduct the Team Spirit joint military 
exercise -- a test nuclear war and a preliminary war to invade 
the North. 
  Now the U.S. warmongers say that if the Team Spirit joint 
military exercise cannot be conducted, they plan to conduct 
another joint military exercise targeted at our Republic. They 
are babbling that if the joint military exercise cannot be 
conducted in South Korea, they will conduct it even in Hawaii. 
  In actuality, the U.S. Forces based in Okinawa will begin a 
military move regarded as the conduction of the Team Spirit-94 
joint military exercise. 
  Facts show that the Team Spirit war exercise will become a 
reality. In spite of the strong opposition by our people and 
the people of the world, if the Team Spirit war exercise is 
conducted, the tension in our country will be extremely 
aggravated and the dark cloud of nuclear war will hover over our 
people. 
  Furthermore, at a time when tension has been extremely 
aggravated due to nuclear inspection moves by the United States 
and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] against us, 
conducting the Team Spirit war exercise is very dangerous, like 
playing a war gamble on an arsenal depot. If such a very 
dangerous thing is overlooked, the irrevocable nuclear holocaust 
will be imposed upon our nation. 
  Thus, in face of the fascist suppression, South Korean 
youth, 
students, and people are staging strong struggles calling for 
the United States to discontinue the Team Spirit war exercise. 
  Our nation cannot fall a victim to nuclear holocaust. 
Whether they are in the North, South, or overseas, the people 
who think about the future of the country and the nation should 
rise up to the just struggle to prevent and frustrate the U.S. 
nuclear war moves through the unity of all nations. 
  The United States should give up the moves to conduct the 
Team Spirit war exercise move as claimed by the South Korean 
people, it should get out of South Korea immediately by 
withdrawing its forces, nuclear weapons, and all aggression 
forces from South Korea. 
  If the United States persistently conducts the Team Spirit 
war exercise in spite of our people's strong opposition, it 
should be entirely held responsible for the consequence arising 
therefrom.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 18 (KCNA) -- The collection of 
travel notes "Visit to the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea" has been brought out in Japan. 
  The book contains travel notes written by the members of a 
delegation of the Aomori Prefecture Solidarity Committee of 
Japan for supporting Korea's reunification who visited Korea 
last year and photographs taken by them. 
  Reitaburo Sagawa, who led the delegation, in his travelogue 
says the DPRK has registered phenomenal achievements under the 
wise guidance of the great leader President Kim Il-song. The 
policy of believing in the masses and relying upon them is the 
driving force of socialist construction in the DPRK, he notes. 
  He states that the policy centred on the masses in Korea 
proves the superiority of socialism. 
  "The demand of the International Atomic Energy Agency for a 
'special inspection' of the military sites of the DPRK, is, no 
doubt, based on the manoeuvres of the United States, Japan, etc. 
The United States seeks in this to keep its forces in South 
Korea for a long period and disarm the DPRK," he says.

display "Party's Care Will Be Eternal" now being performed in 
celebration of the birthday of the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il from Februray 16 is evoking great repercussions upon

"Let Us Uphold Our Party" and "Singlehearted Loyalty and Filial

of the Korean people extending highest honour and wishing a long 
life and good health to Comrade Kim Chong-il who is enjoying a 
unanimous respect and admiration and absolute support and trust 
from the revolutionary people over the world. 
  Executive Secretary General of the C.C. [Central Committee],

be performed only by the youth and children of Korea, stressing 
the unified rhythm and correct action of the performers were 
surprising. 
  "The mass gymnastic display of Korea is a grand performance 
going beyond human imagination. This is a most splendid 
masterpiece that people all over the world should see", he said. 
  Prof. of Economics Takao Kamakura of Saitama University of 
Japan who is also director of the board of the International

the invariable faith and will of the Korean youths who are 
determined to uphold and follow His Excellency Dear Kim Chong-il 
to the end," he said. 
  National leader of the Communist Party of Canada (M-l) 
Hardial Bains stressed such wonderful work as the mass gymnastic 
display of Korea can be seen nowhere in the world. 
  "Seeing the performers joyfully displaying their talents I 
could deeply feel that Korea's children are very happy in the 
bosom of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and that their future is already 
promised," he said.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 18 (KCNA) -- Papers here today 
carry articles on the lapse of 20 years since the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il proclaimed the programme of modelling the 
whole society on the chuche idea on Feb. 19, 1974. 
  This was a proud event in which the chuche idea was declared 
a great guiding idea of the socialist cause in the present time, 
the author of a NODONG SINMUN article says. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is quoted as saying: 
  "...The idea, theory and method of chuche founded by the 
great leader are the most correct ones for the guidance of the 
building of socialism and communism in our time." 
  The article continues: 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il developed and enriched 
the chuche idea with his energetic ideological and theoretical 
activities, comprehensively reviewed the history of the 
preceding revolutionary thought of the working class and 
scientifically analysed the rich experience of the Korean 
revolution and the historical lessons of the socialist movement. 
On this basis, he formulated the chuche idea in an integral 
system so that it could shine as the guiding idea of our time. 
  He proclaimed the programme of modelling the whole society 
on 
the chuche idea and made the chuche idea the flawless guiding 
idea of the age of independence. This was a great event which 
brought about a new turn in the development of socialist thought 
and its cause. 
  This was also a historic milestone in heralding a new epoch 
in the history of human thought and a historic turning point in 
placing our socialism on a firmer ideological and theoretical 
basis. 
  The proclamation of programme by Comrade Kim Chong-il is a 
great exploit which makes it possible to successfully build 
socialism on the basis of the chuche idea. 
  It is a programme of advancing the revolution with the 
revolutionary idea of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, the 
chuche idea, as the guiding principle and build and perfect 
communist society on the basis of this idea. With this 
programme declared, it was clarified for the first time in 
history that the course of building socialism and communism is a 
course of implementing the leader's revolutionary idea and 
modelling the whole society on it. 
  In the history of the communist movement spanning one 
hundred 
and dozens of years, no party had ever raised the modelling of 
the whole society on the leader's revolutionary idea as the 
programme of building communism. This great revolutionary 
programme could be propounded only by Comrade Kim Chong-il who 
has a chuche outlook on the revolutionary cause of the working 
class and unfailing loyalty to the leader's cause. 
  Definite priority should be given to the remoulding of 
people 
in order to raise their consciousness of independence and 
creative ingenuity and, on this basis, nature and society be 
transformed. This is the true path of building communism 
indicated by the chuche idea and that is what the modelling of 
the whole society on the chuche idea means. 
  The programme of modelling the whole society on the chuche 
idea is a most scientific programme clarifying the way of fully 
realising the independence of the popular masses, the makers of 
history, and an immortal revolutionary banner under which to 
resolutely defend the socialist cause and bring it to 
accomplishment under any circumstance. 
  The unity of our society in ideology and purpose on the 
basis 
of the chuche idea has been immensely strengthened, a true model 
of socialism based on singlehearted unity been built, the 
ages-old idea of the popular masses been put into reality and 
their independent life been ensured through the transformation 
of all spheres of social life as required by chuche. These are 
great achievements made in the course of modelling the whole 
society on the chuche idea. 
  The programme of modelling the whole society on the chuche 
idea is a historical cause which can be successfully 
accomplished only by Comrade Kim Chong-il who has intense 
loyalty to the chuche cause, iron will and faith to carry out 
the revolution with chuche-based ideas and theories and 
clairvoyant wisdom and outstanding leadership ability. 
  He was the first in history to propound the perfect 
revolutionary programme embodying the guiding idea of the time 
and wisely guide the efforts to implement it, setting a 
brilliant example of socialist construction. This is a great 
and imperishable exploit of his for the people's cause of 
independence.

  [Text] With regard to U.S. moves for the revival of the 
Super 301 provision, the Japanese Government observes that 
"because it is President Clinton's campaign pledge, there is a 
great possibility of the revival," (as stated by an official at 
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry). However, 
some Japanese Government officials doubt whether the Super 301 
provision will be actually invoked as a retaliatory measure in 
the wake of the recent breakdown in the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks. 
  The Super 301 provision requires the U.S. Government to 
consider sanctions based on an annual report on trade barriers 
which is issued every spring. For this reason, the revival of 
the Super 301 provision does not mean an immediate retaliatory 
action. In 1989, the U.S. Government studied a possibility of 
imposing sanctions against Japan over disputes concerning 
satellites, supercomputers, and timber products. However, 
sanctions were avoided because an agreement was reached in the 
Japan-U.S. negotiations.

<F P=106> [Article by U.S. Bureau Chief Yoichi Funabashi: "Changing </F>
Stands of the United States"] 
  [Text] The new, "mature" era of the Japanese-U.S. 
relationship began with the Clinton administration resuming 
attacks on Japan, using the high yen and economic sanctions as 
weapons. This is a strange situation in which even the 
President is not hesitating to talk about a "trade war" between 
Japan and the United States. Both countries declared, after the 
framework talks broke up, that they would resume the framework 
talks after a "cooling-off period." But the character of the 
U.S. negotiating team, the team's attitude in the talks, the 
pressure it is receiving, as well as its views on the politics 
of Japan have changed greatly from the past. If Japan fails to 
recognize this change adequately, another rupture in the talks 
is possible. What has changed in this era of "mature" 
frictions? We will examine it. 
<H5>  Compromise Comes Only at Last Moment </H5>
  One of the U.S. congressional staff members blamed the 
rupture in the talks on the presumptuous force of the "lawyer 
mafiosi" such as U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] Mickey Kantor 
and Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshevsky. 
Another official said, "The only way they know how to do things 
is to demand the highest possible price, and then to bargain at 
the last moment." They overdid it this time, and they failed. 
  The USTR with his lawyer's seriousness persisted with the 
"numerical targets" issue, warding off attempts to attach 
loopholes to them. There is no denying that this made a 
political decision difficult. In Japan, there are wishful 
voices saying, "If only Kantor were not there" (to quote one of 
negotiating team's members), but (according to a White House 
staff member), his political standing now is "very strong, for 
he is close to Mrs. Clinton." 
<H5>  The NEC's Predominance </H5>
  The power of the National Security Council (NSC), which used 
to have the final say on Japanese-U.S. relations during the cold 
war, is now falling fast with the appearance of its rival, the 
National Economic Council (NEC), which is having a great impact. 
Particularly with respect to economic relations with Japan, the 
NEC's power is clearly predominant. In the "mature" 
relationship, which may mean having economic matters handled 
separately from political and security matters, this state of 
the NSC being unable to fully interfere in the NEC's formulation 
of policies on Japan is likely to become permanent. 
<H5>  Gephardt </H5>
  During the days of the Republican government, the issues of 
trade with Japan were always a "political football" to be kicked 
around between the government and the Democratic-led Congress. 
There were signs that the Democratic Congress bashed Japan in 
order to bash the Republican government. 
  Now both the government and Congress are headed by the 
Democrats, but the "political football" is being kicked around 
between President Clinton and the protectionist force of House 
majority leader Gephardt, who is supported by major trade 
unions. There is a strong residue of hard feelings after the 
President enlisted the help of the Republican Party in pushing 
for NAFTA in the face of labor's objections to this treaty. The 
trade issues with Japan are thus also being used as a 
"compensating" mechanism by which the President wants to restore 
his relations with labor. 
<H5>  Business </H5>
  Japanese-U.S. trade frictions -- whether in the framework 
talks or concerning sanctions -- are almost always the upshot of 
persistent campaigns waged by one or two companies or the heads 
of these companies. 
  Many times, lobbying efforts in Washington by top executives 
of Cray Computers or the Motorola company have simply turned 
into demands made by the U.S. Government of the Japanese 
Government. 
  "Previously, leaders of major corporations got together and 
agreed on what the government should demand of other countries, 
but there is no longer such a group of leaders who share the 
government's goals," said Mr. Donald Gartin of the Atlantic 
Council, who used to be involved in business roundtable talks by 
big business associations. 
  Besides, high-tech businesses have close relations with the 
Defense Department (Pentagon). Since the end of the cold war, 
the Pentagon has been active in promoting the development of the 
high-tech industry. This is also creating a new perspective 
within the Pentagon concerning Japan, with the former coming to 
consider it a "rival" rather than an "ally." 
  Almost all the members of the U.S. negotiating team are 
persons who have the experience of having earlier done business 
in Japan or with Japan. What is common among these people is 
the conviction that "the Japanese market is not open; Japan is 
not like other countries." Mr. Robert Kief, a political 
consultant, said: "The allegations that the U.S. Government has 
no people who know Japan are totally groundless. It is full of 
people who know Japan. But the problem is that they know Japan 
wrongly." The argument of the so-called revisionists about 
"Japan being unlike other countries" which emerged in the late 
1980's is now losing its impact among intellectuals, but it 
appears that such a way of thinking is only gaining force among 
the people occupying the political and economic circles. 
  An official close to President Clinton said that the 
president is one of these people. According to the official, 
one of the reasons why the President decided to break up the 
talks was out of concern that "the economic recession in Japan 
is not as serious as is reported, and that Japan will pull 
through this and will become even stronger." Is this an 
expression of the belief that "Japan is different from other 
ordinary countries?"

  [Text] It has been disclosed that on the issue of market 
access discussed at the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) 
Mickey Kantor sent letters, which were dated 16 February and 
contained new proposals, to Japan and the European Union (EU). 
As he explained before, Kantor, in the letter, demands that 
Japan lower tariffs on forestry products and distilled liquor. 
The Japanese Government plans to reject the demand, saying: 
"We already reached an agreement late last year on the tariff 
issue." Now that a ministerial meeting, scheduled to be held in 
April to sign an accord, is drawing near, however, the Uruguay 
Round is facing new difficult issues. In the letters, Kantor 
proposes that the United States, Japan, and the EU develop a new 
package. While explaining a plan to scale down [kotai] a 
proposal, in which the United States pledged to reduce tariffs 
on such items as electronic machines, Kantor urges Japan to make 
additional tariff cuts on forestry products and other goods. 
From the EU, Kantor is demanding further reduction of tariffs on 
aluminum. The United States is saying that it will lower a part 
of its tariffs on trucks. However, the letters call for a 
scale-down in each nation's average tariff reduction rate. 
  It seems that USTR Kantor sent the letters because of 
pressure from the U.S. Congress. However, both Japan and the EU 
are opposing the U.S. proposals. They will strongly urge the 
U.S. Government to abide by the agreement reached late last 
year. At the same time, Japan and the EU are studying the 
possibility of asking GATT Secretary General Sutherland to act 
as a mediator.

  [Text] The U.S. Government has announced that it has 
decided to begin taking the process of slapping sanctions on 
Japan in connection with the issue of increasing U.S. mobile and 
car phone manufacturers' access to the Japanese market. In 
response, Takenori Kanzaki, minister of posts and 
telecommunications, issued on the morning of 16 February a 
statement saying, "Japan has scrupulously observed an agreement 
concluded between Japan and the United States, and I regret the 
U.S. Government's decision." In the statement, the minister 
also said, "If the United States imposes sanctions on Japan, 
Japan will deal with the sanctions in accordance with GATT's 
rules." In this way, he indicated that Japan will not hesitate 
to take its case to GATT. Meanwhile, the U.S. Government is 
reportedly studying the possibility of slapping more sanctions 
on Japan following the breakdown of the Japanese-U.S. framework 
talks. In his statement, Mr. Kanzaki expressed his vigilance 
about the move by the U.S. Government, saying, "Although I 
cannot clearly anticipate what sort of sanctions the U.S. 
Government is planning to impose on Japan, the U.S. Government 
will undoubtedly take a tough stand on trade toward Japan." 
  The posts and telecommunications minister in his statement 
stressed that the Japanese Government has fulfilled its side of 
the Japanese-U.S. agreement on mobile phones by taking the 
necessary steps, including allotting frequencies to U.S. firms, 
and he said that the U.S. Government's reason for imposing 
sanctions on Japan is not justified. 
  A government source indicated on the morning of 16 February, 
"Japan has been doing what it has to do, and I believe that U.S. 
firms' business efforts probably have been inadequate." The 
Japanese Government is poised to wait and observe future 
developments for the time being, saying, "It is hard to take any 
action until the sanctions to be imposed on Japan by the U.S. 
Government come to light." The Japanese Government, however, 
intends to take Japan's case to GATT if the U.S. Government 
imposes sanctions on Japan. Some government officials take the 
view that "If the Japanese Government takes Japan's case to GATT 
to argue with the U.S. Government at the GATT's arbitration 
panel, it is clear that the U.S. Government has no justified 
counterarguments and that the U.S. Government may not actually 
impose sanctions on Japan."

  [Text] It is known that with Japan and the United States 
being locked in confrontation over automobiles and mobile 
phones, the U.S. firm Motorola has asked the Japan Mobile 
Communications Company [JMCC] to set numerical targets for the 
purchase of its mobile phones. In response, JMCC has rejected 
this request by claiming that "making any commitment to our 
future purchase of mobile phones runs counter to free 
competition." This is the first time that Motorola, Inc. has 
asked for numerical targets, in taking advantage of the recent 
Japanese-U.S. mobile-phone friction, which has its roots in the 
"1989 Japanese-U.S. agreement." It has become clear that 
Motorola, Inc. has a strategy of pressing Japan not only to 
increase the number of ground relay stations serving it but also 
to increase the purchase of its mobile phones. 
  JMCC has decided to invest 30 billion yen in building more 
ground relay stations for Motorola's mobile-phone service in 
Japan over the next two or three years. The U.S. mobile-phone 
company expects the number of its subscribers to grow to 450,000 
by the end of 1996. Motorola, Inc. has asked JMCC to place 
orders for 225,000 sets of Motorola-made mobile phones within 45 
days after Japanese subscribe to Motorola's mobile-phone 
service. The U.S. mobile phone company also has asked JMCC to 
increase the ground relay stations available to it "two years 
earlier than planned." 
  Motorola, Inc. is posed to press Japan for the simultaneous 
expansion of market access and purchases, but JMCC is resisting 
this pressure, asserting, "The Japanese mobile-phone market will 
be liberalized in April, and we cannot accept the request of 
Motorola, Inc." 
  Motorola's request, which was made just before 15 February, 
which is the deadline set by the U.S. Government for a survey of 
the Japanese mobile-phone market, was an "ultimatum." For this 
reason, the growing opinion is that the breakdown of the 
Japanese-U.S. framework talks has influenced the United States 
to "confirm Japan's violation of the Japanese-U.S. agreement."

  [Text] The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MPT] 
disclosed on 16 February details of the U.S. demand for access 
to the Japanese market for car telephones and cellular 
telephones made by U.S. firms. The main points of the demand 
are: 1) Japan Ido Tsushin [Mobile Communication] Company (IDO) 
should increase the rate of using the U.S. Motorola system to 
"the same level" as that for Nihon Telegram and Telephone 
Company's (NTT) system by increasing the number of base stations 
before the end of 1994; 2) the MPT should guarantee that Ido 
carry out its plan, and should transfer Ido's license on running 
the Motorola system to a different company which is more willing 
to do business in case Ido fails to do so; 3) part of the 
frequencies used by the NTT system should be reassigned to the 
Motorola system to prevent Ido from further expanding the use of 
the NTT system. 
  The MPT rejects the U.S. demand for increasing the number of 
base stations for the Motorola system, saying "Ido will have to 
make facility investment beyond its financial capability" to do 
that. Regarding the compulsory transfer of a license to a third 
party, the MPT insists "it goes beyond the government's 
jurisdiction under the current law," and adds "they are demands 
that can never be met." The MPT has so far taken the stand that 
"we cannot talk about the details of the negotiations in 
progress," but has decided to make the details public now that 
the United States has ruled Japan violated the 1989 agreement. 
These demands were supposed to have been received on 10 January. 
  The Japan-U.S. agreement concluded in 1989 gave new 
frequencies to the Motorola system so that Motorola-system 
equipment can be used in the Tokyo or Nagoya area. Ido, which 
had new frequencies assigned to it pursuant to the accord, 
started providing service by the Motorola system since the fall 
of 1991 in addition to the existing service by the NTT system. 
But, right now, while the number of the NTT system telephones 
number about 310,000 units, that of the Motorola system 
telephones is only about 10,000 units. This is the reason for 
the U.S. dissatisfaction.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 18 February Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] Discussing what Japan should do in view of the 
breakdown in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, a senior 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] official 
said on 17 February: "We should review and augment the Five 
Year Economic Plan for a Better Quality of Life and the 430 
trillion yen plan for public investment by this fall, and 
clarify our position from the next fiscal year." He indicated 
that Japan should clearly manifest its efforts to reduce the 
trade surplus through the expansion of domestic demand in order 
to win the understanding of the United States. 
  The official also touched on the ratio of the current 
accounts surplus to GNP (2.8 percent) in the government's 
economic forecast for fiscal 1994, saying: "If we can come up 
with a figure for the ratio of the surplus to GNP in the process 
of reviewing the economic programs, we will be able to predict 
the course of the Japanese economy from fiscal 1995." He, in 
effect, suggested that Japan should draw up a voluntary plan for 
reducing the current accounts surplus. This was the first time 
a senior government official has referred to the need to set a 
macroeconomic target. Such a remark seemed to represent an 
effort to meet U.S. expectations by setting a "voluntary target" 
at the macroeconomic level through the inclusion of a ratio for 
current accounts surplus in Japanese economic plans. 
  However, the senior official stressed that this ratio "is 
absolutely a voluntary figure to be shown to the people; it is 
not a target to fulfill for the United States." 
  Last July, at the beginning of the framework talks, the 
United States demanded the setting of macroeconomic numerical 
targets, such as the ratio of current accounts surplus, but 
Japan refused. This eventually led to an agreement to draw up 
"objective criteria" in specific sectors, such as automobiles 
and auto parts, and so forth.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Look For Other Ways To Reduce the Surplus"] </F>
  [Text] With the breakdown of economic framework talks at 
the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks, there has obviously been a 
number of negative effects, such as the rapid appreciation of 
the yen, and moves by the U.S. Government to impose sanctions 
against Japan in automobiles and mobile phones. 
  Japan is at a loss as to what is the effective way to deal 
with this new development. It is now important to face the 
situation calmly, and try to look for even one or two concrete, 
viable ways to straighten out Japan-U.S. economic relations 
before the meeting of leaders of the advanced nations (Naples 
Summit) in July. 
  There are two aspects to U.S. President Bill Clinton's 
evaluation of the recent summit talks. First, he is 
disappointed that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa was not able 
to override the bureaucrats. On the other hand, he also pins his 
hopes on further serious efforts by both leaders to deal with 
the problem. 
  However, such hopes are not necessarily shared by officials 
who work closely with the President. People around him, 
including Congress, still work at cross purposes. 
  Regarding the appreciation of the yen, while the President 
did talk about the "foreign exchange rate factor" at a news 
conference, there is no conclusive evidence that the Clinton 
administration is manipulating the exchange rate. 
  It remains to be seen whether the U.S. Government will now 
engage in vigorous Japan bashing. 
  We would like to make three suggestions to Prime Minister 
Hosokawa. It was right to say "no" to the U.S. demand for 
numerical targets. All U.S. scholars who have received the 
Nobel Prize for economics oppose numerical targets. However, we 
need alternative proposals on what to do with the huge trade 
surplus against the United States. 
  In this regard, Japanese and U.S. negotiators were stuck on 
the issue of numerical targets at the framework talks. We need 
to come up with a comprehensive plan, and present this to the 
United States. 
  Second, something should be done to normalize relations 
between the automobile industries in both countries. 
Fortunately, Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota Motor 
Corporation, has been designated the next chairman of Keidanren 
[Federation of Economic Organizations]. The prime minister 
should support a private sector-led solution to restore the 
balance between the Japanese and U.S. automobile industries. 
  This will probably take the form of mutual market 
participation through horizontal division of labor. There 
should be an unbiased way for both parties to make use of each 
other's marketing networks. Reaching a compromise on automobiles 
will enhance the sense of equality between Japan and the United 
States, and contribute to the solution of a considerable part of 
the trade imbalance issue. 
  Third, in the multimedia sector, where the United States 
enjoys a significant edge, Japan should accept U.S. leadership. 
It will be much cheaper for Japan to just adopt U.S. 
technology. Then, Japan can devote time to improve on such 
technology to develop original technology for Asia. 
  The point is, to work on the key issues of Japan-U.S. 
friction from a broad perspective. If we merely come up with 
trivial piecemeal measures, it will only serve to aggravate the 
distrust between Japan and the United States. 
  The prime minister seems unable to attract talented 
advisers. 
Therefore, even if he is successful at coordination, there can 
be no new creative ideas. He should look for people who can 
come up with real ideas, and listen to their suggestions. While 
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry is good at 
discussing specific issues, recently, its ideas lack coherence. 
  In the financial sector, Japan should also establish 
principles as soon as possible that will guarantee no 
discrimination in investments in Japan. In the insurance sector 
negotiations, the United States was distrustful of the Japanese 
negotiators. Japan is partly to blame for this. 
  It is easy to criticize the United States; some say it acts 
like a spoiled brat. However, this will only put Japan in a 
difficult position. 
  Even regarding the issue of the exchange rate, the dollar is 
strong against the European currencies. Japanese companies 
cannot afford to raise the price of their products even with the 
appreciation of the yen. Therefore, for the time being, a 
strong yen will not affect prices in the United States. The 
United States is taking advantage of Japan's weak point. 
  However, there is no need to worry too much about the strong 
yen. The fact that there has been a reversal in the balance of 
power between Japan and the United States means the exchange 
rate will recover to a realistic level in due course.

  [Text] Hideaki Kumano, administrative vice minister of 
international trade and industry, expressed deep concern 14 
February about the recent steep rise in the yen's value. He 
said: "I am greatly concerned about the impact of the yen's 
appreciation on the economy. The economic recession has lasted 
for four years. However, the economy -- far from being 
revitalized for the first time in four years -- will be cooled 
down by the recent strong yen." 
  Vice Minister Kumano pointed out: "The yen's appreciation 
will largely worsen profits of export-oriented companies. In 
the short-term the exchange rate will have a negative impact on 
people's incomes rather than a favorable effect on commodity 
prices." 
  He stressed that if economic conditions in Japan 
deteriorated 
further due to growing pressure for the yen to appreciate, it 
would have an unfavorable effect on the world economy as well as 
on the Japanese economy.

  [Text] Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], delivered a lecture at the 
Foreign Correspondents Club on 16 February. Referring to a 
possible political realignment in the future, Kubo said: "I 
think it is impossible to merge coalition parties into one based 
on the theory of nation building, behind which there is an idea 
of establishing a two-conservative-party system advocated by 
Ichiro Ozawa, chief secretary of Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party]." In this way, he indicated that the SDPJ would not 
agree to a plan proposed by Shinseito and Komeito that coalition 
parties should merge and form "a new party" to contest the next 
House of Representatives election as a single party. 
  Kubo stressed: "I share the same view with Hokkaido Governor 
Yokomichi. We think that the coalition parties should cooperate 
in tackling urgent issues and that those who aim to establish a 
similar government should cooperate." In a question and answer 
session after the lecture, Kubo clarified differences between 
his idea and Ozawa's, saying: "My idea about the nation is 
different from Ozawa's. I think we also have differing opinions 
on Japan's international contributions and the Constitution." 
  With regard to the issue of reshuffling the cabinet, Kubo 
said: "If the government is considering a cabinet reshuffle to 
remove a certain minister, it will lose its centripetal force."

<F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 18 February Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] In an interview with MAINICHI SHIMBUN on 17 
February, Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito, 
reiterated his support for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's 
plan to reshuffle the cabinet. He also said: "Objectively 
speaking, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura was the one 
who created the cabinet reshuffle problem." He indicated the 
cabinet reshuffle issue had nothing to do with a realignment of 
the political world, but was caused by Takemura's inappropriate 
behavior as chief cabinet secretary. 
  Commenting on Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] 
Secretary General Wataru Kubo's view that the future 
administration should be a coalition under a "trilateral 
structure" consisting of the "new conservative forces," "new 
reformist forces," and Liberal Democratic Party, Ichikawa said: 
"Such a setup will not be suitable under the heiritsu system 
[electoral system combining single-seat constituencies with 
proportional representation]." 
  Commenting further on a suggestion by the SDPJ and Chairman 
Akira Yamagishi of Rengo [Japanese Trade Union Confederation] 
that "social democracy" or "liberalism" should serve as the 
unifying force of the political regime, Ichikawa said: "That is 
a question for the distant future. We should unite and fight in 
the election as an extension of cooperation in reform efforts 
(such as Diet reform and deregulation)." He expressed his 
belief that the present coalition framework should develop into 
a new-new party. He maintained: "It is the SDPJ which should 
undertake self-reform first in the areas of foreign policy, 
defense, energy, and taxation, to make itself a proper key 
component of the political regime."

<F P=106> [Article by Hiroyoshi Ono, SANDE MAINICHI reporter] </F>
  [Text] Ichiro Ozawa and Ryutaro Hashimoto have become 
the undisputed leaders of the political world. The two have 
begun a "confrontation" outside of the Diet also. One has 
published the book Blueprint for Building a New 
Japan, and the other has published a policy book on 
Vision of Japan. Which of these books will prove to 
be a plus for Japan's immediate future? We asked Sophia 
University Professor Kuniko Iguchi (international politics) to 
act as the referee. 
  [Iguchi] In the past, policy has been announced in the form 
of the party platform or the party's stereotyped ideological 
stance. However, with the appearance of these books in easily 
readable and accessible form for everyone, pricewise, I believe 
that a new format has been presented for policy debate in Japan 
in the post-Cold War era. Also, because both books were prepared 
for critique when they were published, I would like to evaluate 
them as a courageous first step, hoping that it will develop 
into a new trend. 
  (Shinseito representative director) Ozawa's Blueprint 
for Building a New Japan (Kodansha) was published in May 
1993 and is a best seller with over 600,000 copies sold. Also, 
in late November (LDP Policy Research Council chairman) 
Hashimoto made public his Vision of Japan (KK 
Bestsellers) with 100,000 copies already sold, proving a good 
matchup. 
  [Ono] Leaving an overall evaluation of the "Ozawa-Hashimoto" 
contest until later, we asked Professor Iguchi to analyze the 
individual policies. There is a wide divergence between their 
views concerning the "foreign affairs stance." 
  "One of my beliefs regarding foreign affairs is to maintain 
a 
close alliance with the United States" (from Ozawa's book - 
hereafter referred to by the symbol *). 
  "As long as the United States continues to be a Pacific 
nation, Japan has no intention of shaking the axis of U.S.-Japan 
relations. However, when the United States has forgotten its 
face as a Pacific nation, we will be forced to change U.S.-Japan 
relations whether we like it or not" (from Hashimoto's book - 
hereafter referred to by the symbol **). 
  [Iguchi] The above quotes show a considerable disparateness. 
Ozawa's quote represents a pro-American line, while Hashimoto's 
quote leaves a little distance. Rather than being an out-and-out 
pro-American line, I believe his point is to stress the 
Asia-Pacific framework as central. 
  There is a somewhat over-conceptualized aspect in Ozawa, and 
I believe that, in the case of a "normal nation," he sees the 
United States as a normal nation. However, it is the United 
States that is a special nation and, if we say that all the 
other nations are not normal nations unless they play military 
roles and are armed like the United States, the world would 
become extremely unstable. Therefore, I believe that the 
majority of the world's nations probably wish to become 
Japan-style states, that is, "lightly armed economic states." 
Today, with the Cold War ended, I believe that they support a 
style like Japan. 
  Also, Ozawa looks only at the classic U.S.-Japan relations, 
so that there is a lack of plane expansion. A nation that has no 
local support has no persuasive power on the international 
stage. Therefore, support in Asia is a prerequisite, and it can 
be argued that Japan must have support in Asia in order to 
protect its national interests in U.S.-Japan relations. 
  On the other hand, Hashimoto says: "U.S.-Japan relations are 
certainly important, but they are not something that must be 
protected by relinquishing sovereignty." However, in modern 
times when economic interdependence has increased, the concept 
of sovereignty has changed. Intervention in internal affairs and 
sovereignty were strongly stressed among the 19th century-type 
military states. However, with growing interdependence, a nation 
is impacted greatly by the economic trends in the other nations. 
Therefore, any nation would argue over these trends. 
  Consequently, in terms of economic management, I believe 
that 
it is contrary to the long-term national interest if the 
formation of a common base is hindered by bringing up the 
concept of sovereignty, and we should consider this point. This 
is a stereotyped way of expression, is it not? 
  Also, U.S.-Japan relations are decisively important and must 
absolutely not be broken. It is also true for the United States. 
However, there are many more options on the U.S. side to 
undermine them, such as the EC and Russia. There is only the 
United States for Japan. Therefore, depending on the situation, 
Japan must often compromise. If there is dissatisfaction with 
the situation and a notion to align itself with another region, 
such as the Asia-Pacific region, it is an extremely naive notion. 
<H5>  Expectations Toward a Japan-Style National Existence </H5>
  An Asia-Pacific region without the United States cannot be a 
substitute for the United States from Japan's standpoint. 
Japan's economy cannot stand up by trading only with the nations 
of Asia. An Asia-Pacific sphere including the United States must 
be reinforced, and the notion that only the United States and 
Europe, that is, the EC, will suffice in the world must be 
defeated. 
  In terms of foreign affairs, severe demands are made of both 
leaders. 
  What about "national security and the problem of the 
constitution" which in reality faces the issue of international 
contribution? 
  (Ozawa's book) "What is meant by a `normal nation?' It means 
to perform what is considered to be natural conduct in the 
international society under the nation's own responsibility. 
This is particularly true regarding national security." 
  (Hashimoto's book) "My position is not to align with the 
so-called `interpretative constitutional theory.' However, I am 
one who believes that we should engage in PKO [UN peacekeeping 
operations] activities." 
  Ozawa contends that three paragraphs should be added to 
Article 9, Paragraph 2, of the Constitution, and that an article 
should be inserted to ensure that the activities of the 
Self-Defense Forces as a UN standby force or under UN comand are 
not hindered. He also theorizes that this can be adequately met 
by changing the interpretation of the present Constitution. On 
the other hand, I read in Hashimoto's writings his position 
that, while he does not rule out PKF [peacekeeping forces], 
enough can be done within the present limitations. 
  When the United States is called a "normal nation," there is 
an aspect of treating the United States in an absolute light. In 
a sense, it symbolizes the world outlook of Japan's 
conservatives. It is a world outlook of Japan as a small nation. 
As for a normal nation, that is, the United States, Japan would 
like to approach as close as possible to the United States, the 
normal nation. 
  For example, it is said that Japan will militarize if it 
becomes a member of the UN Security Council. Conversely, it is 
inconceivable that the Security Council will play an economic 
role with Japan's entry. The debate does not develop to the 
point where Japan is considered a player in the creation of any 
global aspects. 
  There is some sense of limitation in the idea of aiming 
toward a normal nation like the United States. For the majority 
of nations, aiming toward a Japan-style existence is more 
persuasive. It is more realistically attainable, and I believe 
that we should expect more from such a concept. 
  In addition, the concept of a UN standby force mentioned by 
Ozawa is an unrealistic proposal. 
  As to how the United States is coping with security and 
regional disputes in the post-Cold War era, there are two policy 
directions. 
  One is a desire to win political legitimacy through the use 
of the UN Security Council. However, regarding the other, it 
does not wish to use the United Nations for military purposes. 
In other words, the United Nations does not have any war 
expertise, so the United States cannot put the lives of its own 
soldiers under UN command. Therefore, the United States will 
probably not accept what Ozawa calls a UN standby force. I 
believe that a responsible nation does not think of entrusting 
(its military forces) as a UN standby force. 
  [Ono] Ozawa's book attracted so much attention that the U.S. 
Government reportedly had it totally translated immediately 
after its publication. However, according to Professor Iguchi's 
analysis, within the limits of the "security" theme, the 
thinking of both men remains within the framework of Japanese 
thinking, and there is probably an aspect that is unacceptable 
internationally. 
  [Iguchi] In terms of domestic issues, both men show a strong 
tendency to evolve their pet theories on the problems of 
"welfare" and "independence." 
  (Ozawa's book) "First, the people must be freed from their 
incubator. 
  "Naturally, self-responsibility is thus demanded of the 
people. However, I believe that it is what should be expected. 
Where there is no self-responsibility, free choice does not 
exist." 
  (Hashimoto's book) "My father, who was a politician, spoke 
frankly to his sons about the importance of social security and 
welfare administration from his own experiences, and he coped 
with them. He himself was physically handicapped." 
<H5>  The People's Evaluation of "the Shape of Japan as a Nation" </H5>
  Here, too, the difference in stances between the two is 
apparent. Ozawa's position is that one must look after onself, 
and that it is the same in the case of individuals as well as 
nations. Hashimoto shows a very deep concern for the weak. I 
believe that it is based on special emotions about his own home 
environment. 
  I believe that Ozawa's desire to seek what he calls 
"self-responsibility" from companies and organizations will be 
the trend in the future era of deregulation. 
  However, it is linked to the question of why the state 
exists. While there are such classical roles as defense and the 
law-governed state, I believe that there is an additional desire 
for the state to serve as a haven for the weak. 
  In effect, in ordinary times, everyone can be independent as 
citizens and assume self-responsibility. However, there are 
cases where people are burdened with extreme risks, or become 
suddenly physically handicapped one day, or are faced with a 
major natural disaster. In such cases, I believe that they wish 
to depend on the state. In that sense, Hashimoto's viewpoint 
concerning the weak and welfare will draw empathy. 
Simultaneously, it does not conflict with Ozawa's theory either. 
I believe that both can be considered in tandem. 
  Now for the overall evaluation of the books by the two. 
  Unfortunately, Hashimoto does not touch upon the aspects 
that 
relate to the real political trend, such as how to wrest 
administrative power. 
  In this respect, Hashimoto's close associate comments that 
"the point of his book is centered on Hashimoto's thoughts and 
experiences. It is difficult to write about the moving trend of 
the times." 
  [Ono] On the other hand, Ozawa indicates the "new shape of 
Japan's politics" in his book, and, albeit in a subtle way, it 
is taking shape within real politics. Although Professor Iguchi 
did not rate the two books as either superior or inferior, the 
evaluation of the two books will ultimately depend on how the 
people visualize the "shape of Japan as a nation."

Department of Architecture and Townbuilding has made in 1993 an 
examination of some projects worked out by Mongolian and foreign

Ulaanbaatar Thermoelectric Power Station No. 3 and the electric 
power station of the city of Darhan, which was worked out in the 
USA, and on the technical economic feasibility of the

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, February 17 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- In 
connection with the pending official visit of the Mongolian 
President P. Ochirbat to India the president has granted an 
interview to the newspaper "HINDUSTAN TIMES". 
  Answering the question of the newspaper correspondent, what 
he expects from the visit to India, the head of the Mongolian 
state notes that Mongolia and India were maintaining friendly 
relations from the ancient times. These traditional relations, 
according to the outstanding son of India J. Nehru, have more 
than 1500 years history. Then the President P. Ochirbat 
expresses satisfaction with the present successful development 
of friendly relations and cooperation in all spheres, including 
political, pointing out to an important role of the dialogue of 
leaders of the two countries of the last years in the cause of 
strengthening confidence, mutual understanding, cooperation 
between Mongolia and India. 
  I am confident, announces P. Ochirbat, my present visit will 
become an important event in the history of mutual relations of 
the two countries and will open a new page. During the visit 
the signing of a number of documents, including an agreement on 
friendly relations and cooperation between the two countries, an 
agreement on foundation of an intergovernment commission on 
cooperation, an agreement on refusal of double customs duties 
and income taxes, and an agreement on prevention of evasion of 
payment of taxes, is expected, says the president. 
  Answering the question of the newspaper about the state of 
trade cooperation between Mongolia and India, P. Ochirbat 
announces that in relations of long centuries between the two 
countries the trade relations prevailed. The first trade 
agreement between Mongolia and India was signed in 1968. 
  The volume of Mongolian export to India constituted in 1992 
3.8 thousand US dollars, in 1993 1268.3 thousand US dollars. 
The volume of Indian export to Mongolia constituted in 1992 
1268.3 thousand US dollars, in 1993 1759.3 thousand US dollars. 
In this connection P. Ochirbat also points out to the changes 
in structure of commodity circulation in the last years, its 
shifting from the state limits to the private sphere, which 
creates favourable preconditions for its expansion, opens wide 
perspectives. 
  Answering the question about the existing difficulties in 
expansion of trade relations and the ways of overcoming them, 
the Mongolian president names such objective reasons as Mongolia 
does not have an outlet to sea, absence of direct land transport 
communication between the two countries. In P. Ochirbat's view, 
for overcoming these difficulties it is necessary, first of all, 
to create conditions for development of air communication, use 
the privileges granted to the countries, which do not have an 
outlet to sea. Secondly, also the transport agreements signed 
between Mongolia and her two neighbours are of great importance 
in this cause. 
  Answering the question about the unsolved issues of 
development, which Mongolia is facing now, and the role, which 
India can play in solution of them, the head of the state 
stresses that the country has encountered with many problems on 
the way of transition to market economy. 
  Among them providing with the dwelling, rendering support to 
the aged persons and children, providing them with social 
protection offer considerable difficulties. I think that the 
Indian Government can render a concrete support in this cause 
within the framework of realization of concrete projects, says 
the Mongolian president.

wrestling on the occasion of the big wrestling tournaments held 
on the eve of the Mongolian New Year according to the lunar 
calendar. The fact that the young wrestler C. Byambadorj, 
bearer of the title "Falcon", has won one of the prizes, made a 
big confusion in the prognoses of the experts. 
  Pointing out to the success of the wrestler, who was the 
winner of the tournaments on the occasion of the first issue of 
the newspaper "ARDIYN ERH" in 1990, the editorial staff of the

social democracy, playing a considerable role in political life 
of Europe.

Great Hural N. Bagabandi, the Deputy-Chairman of the Parliament 
J. Gombojav and the Prime Minister P. Jasray to send in their 
resignation. The newspaper publishes the declaration of the

that the National Security Conception, which is being 
elaborated, should be up to the country's peculiarities. 
  In his view, at present the main threat to Mongolia's 
security exists in the sphere of economy.

of Mongolia T. Dashdondov about the outcome of the recent

  [Text] Seoul, 16 Feb -- Secretary Kim Chong-il, the heir 
apparent to President Kim Il-song in the DPRK (North Korea), 
marked his 52d birthday on 16 February. However, foreign 
currency remittance from abroad, a "major financial source" for 
Secretary Kim Chong-il, stopped recently and rumors have it that 
"something unusual" has happened to him. In addition, it is 
observed that his power as heir apparent to President Kim 
Il-song has waned. 
  Since the beginning of this year, South Korean firms and 
Korean firms affiliated with the General Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan [Chongnyon], that have been engaged in trade 
with North Korea, have revealed that foreign currency 
remittances from abroad to Secretary Kim Chong-il have stopped. 
According to a source in Seoul, the "No. 39 Office" of the 
Financial Department of the Central Committee of the Workers' 
Party of Korea, which handles Secretary Kim Chong-il's personal 
finance, has been closed recently. There is an unconfirmed 
report that Choe Su-kil, chief of the office, president of the 
Taesung Bank, and a confidante of Secretary Kim Chong-il, has 
been dismissed. 
  The "No. 39 Office," a secret organ more usually referred to 
as the "party Central Committee No. 39 office," was a personal 
safe for Secretary Kim Chong-il. The office collected and 
managed proceeds from the exports of weapons and "loyal 
contributions" made by North Korea's overseas organizations, 
including the Chongnyon and North Korean diplomats posted to 
foreign nations. The office managed funds with the Taesung Bank 
(in Pyongyang) and the Kumsong Bank (in Vienna) under its 
financial control. The office, which controlled the "party 
economy" independent of the government, was a source of 
financial power for Secretary Kim to help him solidify the 
foundation of his succession as president. 
  South Korean firms are believed to have contacted Choe 
Su-kil, chief of the "No. 39 Office," and other officials with 
its Beijing office, to prepare for future business deals with 
North Korea. Some take the view that the closure of the "No. 39 
Office" is connected to the recent downfall of former Deputy 
Premier and State Planning Committee Chairman Kim Tal-hyun, who 
operated as a contact point with South Korean firms as a 
confidante of Secretary Kim Chong-il. 
  Over the past few years bribery has been pervasive and the 
corruption conspicuous among officials in charge of handling 
foreign currency. In addition, whistle-blowing heightened 
distrust among these officials while other officials close to 
Secretary Kim were subject to disciplinary action. All of this 
action is seen as responsible for the closure of "No. 39 
Office." President Kim Il-song, father of Secretary Kim, was 
the only person in North Korea who could close the office. This 
kind of "reprimand" of Secretary Kim can be seen as part of 
moves by President Kim Il-song to govern North Korea by himself. 
  Meanwhile there has been a change in the North Korean 
leadership, with Kim Yong-chu, a member of the Political Bureau 
and younger brother of President Kim Il-song, being reinstated 
as deputy president last year after 18 years of obscurity. In 
this way, the Kim family has been mobilized to keep the North 
Korean system in place. President Kim Il-song is said to have 
made no mention of Secretary Kim during a meeting with the Rev. 
Billy Graham, creating the impression that Secretary Kim's power 
has waned. 
  North Korea hailed its decision to pull out of the nuclear 
Non- Proliferation Treaty (NPT) last March as a "decision by 
Secretary Kim." But President Kim Il-song now appears to be 
trying to deal personally with the issue of North Korea's 
suspected nuclear development.

  [Text] Bangkok Feb 12 (CTK) -- Czech President Vaclav 
Havel, on a state visit to Thailand since Friday [11 February], 
met today with Thai Premier Chuan Likphai. 
  At the meeting, the Czech delegation pointed to the 
stabilising role Thailand plays in South East Asia and praised 
the country's economic results. 
  The Thai and Czech representatives agreed that the Czech 
Republic can be an entrance gate to Europe for Thailand, while 
Thailand serves as an entrance gate to Indochina for the Czech 
Republic. That is why nothing bars mutual relations from 
developing, the politicians said. 
  Likphai stressed that Thailand was willing to deepen its 
cooperation with the Czech Republic, adding that his country of 
almost 60 million inhabitants presented a big market where it 
was possible to push oneself through. 
  Trilateral cooperation, including that between the Czech 
Republic, Thailand and Vietnam was also discussed. Abolition of 
the U.S. embargo on the trade with Vietnam led to opening of the 
Vietnamese market, Thai representatives said. 
  The meeting also focused on the Central European Free Trade 
Zone (CEFTA) and a similar South East Zone (AFTA). Thai 
politicians see this process as a long-term one and expect it to 
take some 15 years. 
  The Czech delegation drew attention to the considerable 
possibilities of investing in the Czech Republic within the 
privatisation process. They also showed their interest in Thai 
financial participation in the Czech banking sector. 
  Czech Deputy Premier and Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik, one 
of the Czech delegation's members, invited Likphai to Prague on 
behalf of Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus. 
  Havel also met with chairman of the Thai parliament, Marut 
Bunnak. They agreed on a visit of Czech parliamentarians to 
Thailand in late March. 
  Today Havel is to tour some of Bangkok's monuments. Four 
inter-state agreements are also to be signed. 
  Havel today received an honorary degree from Chulalongkorn 
University and gave a speech of thanks. On leaving the 
university, which is named after a turn-of-the-century king who 
abolished slavery, Havel said with a smile he saw an "enormous 
gulf" between the quantity of doctorates he received and the 
quantity of knowledge he had. 
  The way of coexistence of various cultures and powers which 
would not threaten the fate of the globe, is a big task for the 
present world, Havel said in a speech given at the occasion of 
being awarded the title. 
  It is necessary in the present era that a multicultural 
world 
and a multipolar atmosphere in conditions of a single global 
civilisation are created, Havel said. 
  A generally acceptable minimum must be sought within the 
variety of national features, historical and cultural traditions 
and different ways of thinking. This minimum must be cultivated 
with full respect for all differences and equality of their 
bearers. Simply, the era of new global universalism has come, 
Havel said. 
  The several principles included in the mentioned minimum are 
those of respect for the basic human rights -- those to freedom 
and dignity, democracy, a respect for property, including 
private property, care for material development of human 
communities and generally acceptable social rights. Without 
this minimum being sensibly and steadily cultivated, developed 
and deepened, and without the world's identifying itself with 
it, he could hardly imagine that the present civilisation does 
not result in big catastrophes, Havel stressed. 
  A new political metaculture could gradually arise from the 
new spirit of world cooperation. It would be the culture of 
political existence on principles of equality and cooperation 
of various cultures of the present multicultural civilisation, 
he said. 
  Havel said that several basic tools, whose development, 
strengthening and transformation in line with the emerging 
political metaculture should be carried out in the decades to 
come, already exist. These are universal systems, such as the 
UN and other global institutions, including economic ones. 
These institutions' importance will rise with the increase in 
the new spirit of the multicultural world, Havel stated. 
  Besides these institutions, integration groupings are 
important as well, Havel said. As an example of such groupings 
he gave the European Union, Association of the South East Asian 
Nations (ASEAN), Organisation for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) and NATO. He said he viewed these 
institutions as significant elements in the newly emerging 
system of world cooperation, the sense of which surpasses the 
pragmatic framework of the advantages of regional cooperation 
and defence. They are co-creators of the world's political 
metaculture at the same time, as they adhere to many principles 
included in the minimum mentioned above. They cultivate and 
push them through within their reach, and thus make mutual 
political communication within the international community 
easier, Havel emphasised.

  [Text] Bangkok Feb 12 (CTK) -- Czech Deputy Premier and 
Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik and Foreign Minister Josef 
Zieleniec signed today, along with the Thai Foreign Minister 
Prasong Sunsiri, a Czech-Thai trade agreement, agreements on 
protection and support of investments, on prevention of double 
taxation, and on cooperation of the two countries' Foreign 
Ministries. 
  Kocarnik and Zieleniec are members of the Czech delegation 
currently visiting Thailand and headed by Czech President Vaclav 
Havel. 
  Zieleniec said that by signing the agreements, the two 
parties wanted to indicate that their relations were "more 
intensive and surpassed the phase of acquainting each other." 
  At the Czech visitors' meeting with Thai representatives 
today, the discussion focused on a future cooperation between 
the countries associated in the Central European Free Trade 
Agreement (CEFTA), comprising the Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Poland and Slovakia, and the Asian Free Trade Agreement (AFTA), 
of which Thailand is member. 
  "The agreement on this sort of cooperation is very important 
for us, since Asian countries are known for their 
protectionism," Zieleniec said. 
  Kocarnik informed journalists that the Thai partners were 
well acquainted with the economic situation in the Czech 
Republic, which they found "unambiguously the best of all" 
post-communist countries. 
  "The premier (Chuan Likphai) even said he was sorry about 
the 
shortage of (Czech-made) Skoda cars which Thailand had 
imported," Kocarnik said. He added that Thai bankers intended 
to establish a bank in Prague which would promote mutual trade.

  [Text] The National Coalition Government of the Union of 
Burma, NCGUB, welcomes the meeting between U.S. Congressman Bill 
Richardson and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. This meeting is one of the 
results of pressures for reform in Burma. The NCGUB also agrees 
with U.S. Congressman Bill Richardson's proposal for a meeting 
between Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the State Law and Order 
Restoration Council [SLORC]. The NCGUB also firmly believes 
that the political problems in Burma can only be resolved 
through a comprehensive political dialogue and calls on the 
international community to continue pressure on the SLORC until 
this end is achieved.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Clinton's Folly"] </F>
  [Text] The Clinton administration's response to the 
collapse of the weekend trade talks between the United States 
and Japan is disturbing news. Threatening trade sanctions 
against Japan for a transgression of dubious validity, namely, 
failing to ensure that a U.S. company, Motorola, won a certain 
quantitative share of the Tokyo cellular phone market is bad 
enough. To also say, as Mr. Clinton did, that yes, sanctions 
could trigger a trade war but the United States is "willing to 
take that risk" borders on recklessness and irresponsibility. 
Already, stock and currency markets in Asia are reeling. They 
have nothing whatsoever to do with the U.S.-Japan trade spat. 
And there are consumers and producers, buyers and sellers, and 
traders and investors all over our economically interdependent 
world who would be hit. It is tragic and hugely unfair that 
their fortunes should be buffeted by willful economic 
saber-rattling. 
  The operative word here is willful. According to a NEW YORK 
TIMES report, the administration's strategy is to create 
uncertainty and anxiety in Japan so as to drive up the value of 
the yen and thus pressure the Japanese to return to the 
bargaining table on American terms. If true, this suggests a 
cynicism that is misguided and dangerous. It is misguided 
because, first, a sudden and unexpected appreciation of the yen 
without consultation with Japan would undermine the effects of 
the economic stimulus package which the United States Government 
lobbied for and the Japanese Government worked so hard to 
deliver. A prolonged Japanese recession is the last thing U.S. 
producers need if they want to sell more to Japanese consumers. 
Second, a yen appreciation would indeed raise Japan's export 
prices and blunt it competitiveness. But there is a downside: 
Japanese-made parts and components which account for a large 
proportion of Japan's exports to the United States would also be 
more expensive. This would undermine the competitiveness of 
many U.S. industries. Third, even if a stronger yen were a 
great idea, there is not much sense talking the currency up 
without any mechanism to keep it there. The administration's 
strategy is therefore at best, a short-term gamble. And like 
many gambles,it could be dangerous. Far from forcing the 
Japanese to dance to an American tune, it could inflame 
nationalistic sentiment in Japan and stiffen resolve to resist 
U.S. pressure. If the conflict then escalates, the Japanese 
could even be tempted into retaliatory action -- and they are 
not short of options. 
  For now, good sense seems to have prevailed in Tokyo. Japan 
has shown no signs of upping the ante. On the contrary, it has 
said it will take unilateral steps to open its markets -- which 
it must do, because there is truth in much of what the United 
States is complaining about. But Japan has done the responsible 
thing by saying it will take its case to the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade. This is, after all, the rightful place to 
settle disputes of this sort -- disputes that may be bilateral 
in origin but are in today's world, multilateral in their 
effects. It is to the Clinton administration's discredit that 
despite having just recently signed the Uruguay Round, it has 
chosen to disregard it totally.

  [Text] His Excellency [H.E.] Nguyen Manh Cam, the 
Vietnamese foreign minister, left Phnom Penh, capital of the 
Kingdom of Cambodia, with his colleagues this morning after 
concluding a three-day official visit. 
  During their stay in Cambodia, H.E. Nguyen Manh Cam and his 
colleagues were received by Samdech Chea Sim, acting head of 
state and chairman of the Cambodian National Assembly, and held 
talks with First Prime Minister Prince Krompreah Norodom 
Ranariddh and Second Prime Minister Samdech Hun Sen of the Royal 
Government of Cambodia [RGC]. 
  H.E. Nguyen Manh Cam also held talks with his Cambodian 
counterpart, Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut. The focus was on 
consolidating and expanding relations between the two countries 
and peoples of Cambodia and Vietnam, which are based on 
friendship and good-neighborly cooperation. They also discussed 
the issue of the Vietnamese immigrants. Unanimous agreement was 
reached on establishing two mechanisms. The first mechanism is 
to determine the framework for discussions on the border issue, 
to make the Cambodian-Vietnamese border a border of long-lasting 
peace and friendship and to ensure security along the border. 
The second mechanism is to determine the framework for 
discussing the Vietnamese immigrants. The two sides also talked 
about the Mekong committee. They agreed that the exploitation 
of the Mekong River should be based on consensus and should 
benefit all of the countries along the river. H.E. Nguyen Manh 
Cam affirmed that the Vietnamese Government respects Cambodia's 
independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity and wants 
Southeast Asia to become a zone of peace, stability, and 
cooperation. On the issues of the border and the Vietnamese 
immigrants, the two sides agreed to solve these problems 
peacefully and with mutual consideration, using legal principles 
as the basis. 
  During his visit, H.E. Nguyen Manh Cam also signed a 
memorandum of agreement on economic, science and technology, and 
cultural cooperation between the RGC and the Vietnamese 
Government. 
  Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut, deputy prime minister and 
minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation; 
leading Foreign Ministry officials; and various diplomats 
accredited to Cambodia were on hand at Pochentong Airport to see 
off the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry delegation.

  [Text] His Majesty the King points out that the situation 
in Cambodia is deteriorating in all fields and that he will come 
back in April. In his message dated 3 February 1994, His 
Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk pointed out the following: 
  1. Some have unjustly criticized the regime of Sangkum Reas 
Niyum, accusing it of being a dictatorial monarchy. But the 
truth is that during the time of Sangkum Reas Niyum, Cambodia 
had been developed in all fields. At present, some people 
praised about the so-called advanced democracy with multipartite 
system and respect for human rights. But as a matter of fact, 
Cambodia is crumbling in all fields. 
  2. The situation in Cambodia, as a whole, has been severely 
deteriorating. This has indeed let our people and our foreign 
friends to feel deeply hopeless. For that reason, in April this 
year, even though the Chinese doctors do not permit me to do so, 
I will go back to Cambodia in order to help in some fields. 
  3. In the face of such a deteriorating situation, a number 
of foreign friends are prepared to close their diplomatic 
missions or embassies in Phnom Penh.

<F P=106> [By Salim Osman in Jakarta] </F>
  [Text] Jakarta -- President Suharto said yesterday he was 
pleased with the current state of bilateral relations with 
Singapore and suggested that both countries expand their 
cooperation in the field of tourism. Because of Singapore's 
strategic location and excellent facilities such as its 
international airport, he said, the Republic could serve as a 
distribution point for tourists going to Indonesia. 
  He made these points when he received Singapore Foreign 
Minister Prof S. Jayakumar, who called on him at the 
presidential office, Bina Graha, yesterday. 
  The Indonesian leader expressed keen interest in getting 
Singapore's contribution in promoting tourism. 
  Prof Jayakumar told THE STRAITS TIMES after the meeting that 
"we agreed that this was an area for further cooperation for the 
mutual benefit of both countries." 
  Singapore receives an average of six million visitors a 
year, 
compared to Indonesia's three million. 
  Mr Suharto also noted the progress made in the development 
of 
Bintan, Batam and Karimun in the Riau province, in which 
Singapore had a role under the Growth Triangle that includes 
Johor. 
  With such a development, he said, there would be more 
opportunities for Singapore investors to invest here. 
  Prof Jayakumar is in Jakarta for a two-day official visit at 
the invitation of his Indonesian counterpart Ali Alatas, with 
whom he had an hour of talks on Monday. 
  During his meeting with Mr Suharto, they also discussed the 
preparation for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
forum which Indonesia is hosting here in December. 
  "We noted that both Indonesia and Singapore shared common 
interests in the value of APEC and how it would be of benefit to 
ASEAN countries," he said. 
  Mr Suharto, who is currently chairman of the 110-member 
Non-Aligned Movement, took over the chairmanship of APEC after 
the heads of government gathering in Seattle last November. 
  APEC comprises the six members of ASEAN, the United States, 
Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, China, 
Taiwan, Hong Kong, Mexico and Papua New Guinea. 
  On bilateral relations, they noted that there were good 
personal ties between leaders and officials. 
  They agreed to look for ways to strengthen ties between the 
new crop of ministers and officials. 
  Prof Jayakumar, who is also the Law Minister, was 
accompanied 
by Singapore's Ambassador to Indonesia Edward Lee. He also 
called on his counterpart, Utoyo Usman, at his office yesterday. 
  Summing up his impressions of the visit before flying home 
yesterday afternoon, he said: "It has been a very good trip". 
  His visit is part of the traditional series of courtesy 
calls 
made by newly-appointed ASEAN foreign ministers on their 
counterparts. 
  Prof Jayakumar, who has already visited Kuala Lumpur and 
Bandar Seri Begawan, will be going to Bangkok and Manila as well.

if Indonesia made offensive moves, as Portugal has done, it 
would create the impression that the East Timor problem was 
important when, in fact, the problem is a trivial one. He 
clarified that Indonesia has adopted a wait-and-see attitude and 
only issues statements as necessary. 
  Meanwhile, several offensive actions have been carried out 
against Indonesia with regard to its foreign policy and the East 
Timor problem, including the production of a book, criticisms 
against Indonesia, and the friendly [as heard] visit to Dili by 
a European Parliament delegation.

<F P=106> [By Maggie Ford in Jakarta] </F>
  [Text] A banking scandal has erupted in Indonesia, 
implicating former ministers and a son of President Suharto in 
allegations of the improper use of influence over state banks. 
  The scandal follows revelations in the Indonesian Parliament 
that Bapindo, the state-owned development bank had lent U.S.$430 
million to Eddy Tansil, a businessman who heads the Golden Key 
group of companies. 
  Legislator A.A. Baramuli, who belongs to the ruling Golkar 
[Functional Group] party, told MPs that the money had not been 
repaid and was now one of 49 cases of bad or doubtful debts 
amounting to billions of dollars owed to state banks. 
  The loan was apparently made to subsidiaries of Golden Key 
for the construction of petrochemical plants in the West Java 
city of Cilegon. Hutomo Mandala Putra (Tommy), a son of 
President Suharto. was chairman of one of the subsidiaries and 
his Humpuss Group a minor shareholder at the time the loan was 
made. 
  Last week, General Sudomo, former coordinating minister of 
politics and security and now chairman of the president's 
Supreme Advisory Council, said he had recommended that Bapindo 
lend money for the project but that neither he nor his family 
had any personal financial interest in it. Gen. Sudomo had 
earlier strongly criticised the MP who revealed the loan details 
claiming that he had violated bank secrecy laws. 
  A series of current ministers, including Finance Minister 
Mar'ie Muhammed, Governor of the Central Bank Sudrajat 
Jiwandono, and Bapindo executives have appeared in parliament 
denying knowledge of the loan or refusing to answer questions 
about the matter. 
  Their reticence has led to parliamentary calls for revision 
of the bank secrecy laws. 
  J.B. Sumarlin, finance minister at the time the loan was 
granted in 1992 also denied that he had any personal interest in 
the project or that he had recommended it be granted when he was 
a commissioner of Bapindo. 
  Mr. Hutomo admitted he had pushed Bapindo to make the loan 
for the project but said that Humpuss had now sold its 
shareholding in the Golden Key subsidiary because it realised 
that the plant would cost double its planned budget. 
  Mr. Tansil has claimed that he is servicing the loan, but 
there appears little evidence that the money has been used to 
import equipment for the plant, the reason for the loan 
according to a letter of credit issued by Bapindo. Both Mr. 
Tansil and another Golden Key director have been banned from 
leaving Indonesia. 
  Foreign bankers say that the scandal points to the way 
influential people can ignore laws and regulations set up by the 
Central Bank and how state banks have been powerless to reject 
requests for loans from such people. 
  The loan to Mr. Tansil violated Bapindo's legal lending 
limit 
at the time and Mr. Tansil had been taken to court earlier for 
non-payment of loans to foreign banks. 
  "He is well known to Bank Indonesia," a foreign banker said, 
adding that normal credit risk evaluations were clearly not made. 
  The Golden Key case is not the first time that Mr. Hutomo 
has 
been involved in borrowing from state banks for failed projects. 
In 1991, he borrowed U.S. $400 million from the central bank to 
establish a monopoly over the clove trade, which subsequently 
collapsed. 
  Last year, the government ended the practice of so-called 
"memo loans" -- funds granted on the basis of a memo from an 
important individual -- from state banks under a programme 
backed by the World Bank to recapitalise the major state banks.

  [Text] On 11 February 1994, PASASON published some 
information from reporters covering the implementation of 
Lao-U.S. cooperation on U.S. POW-MIA's. In fact, the information 
was not really a statement issued by the Foreign Ministry. Our 
newspaper would like to apologize to its readers. Nevertheless, 
the information included a lot of details that are factual, 
clearly showing the good intentions and sincere cooperation 
rendered by the Lao side and the Lao authorities in implementing 
Lao-U.S. cooperation on Americans killed during the war in Laos. 
Because of the Lao side's wholehearted cooperation, the program 
has been carried out effectively so far. The remains of many 
MIA's have been recovered. While the search for more U.S. MIA 
remains was continuing, however, the Voice of America accused 
the Lao side of failing to cooperate. They even cooked up a 
story claiming that some live U.S. POW's were still in Laos. 
Why are they so suspicious and talkative? 
  As everyone well knows, since 1985 and 1986 Lao and U.S. 
technical teams have cooperated in carrying out excavation 
missions at crash sites of U.S. planes shot down by the Lao 
People's Army and our people throughout Laos. By September 
1993, the two sides had conducted 35 excavations in 11 provinces 
throughout the country and had retrieved the remains of 51 U.S. 
MIA's. According to the authorities concerned, Lao-U.S. 
cooperation in searching for U.S. POW-MIA's in Laos can be 
divided into four areas. The first is doing surveys and 
excavations of crash sites. Second is carrying out 
interrogations and searching for U.S. POW's that the U.S. side 
believes are still alive. Third is conducting interviews with 
prominent persons. Fourth is examining documents and movies 
related to the war. The Lao side has given its full cooperation 
to its U.S. counterparts in all these areas. We even comply 
with any additional requests by the U.S. This is because we are 
sincere. We think it is better to forget about past animosities 
and move on with rebuilding and developing our friendship. This 
is an act of goodwill on the part of the Lao side as well as a 
highly-esteemed humanitarian gesture by the multiethnic Lao 
people. We, the Lao people -- like the American people -- are 
able to differentiate between history, current reality, and the 
future. The Lao and American peoples should step up our 
cooperation in all fields in order to build our respective 
countries and make them prosperous. We should not talk and 
quarrel with one another about the past; it is not good for 
either of us. Of course our cooperation in the search for U.S. 
MIA's in Laos will continue. But it is ridiculous to conjure up 
the ghosts of the past in order to slander each other.

<F P=106> ["Talk" by Singhasai: "Is There Anything Else Behind the </F>
Plan To Set Up Radio Free Asia?"] 
  [Text] International public opinion has appreciated the 
United States' lifting the trade embargo against Vietnam which 
lasted 30 years. Everyone has praised the decision of President 
Clinton as it is considered appropriate, conforming to the 
common trend of the final decade of the 20th century, the era 
regarded by various industrialized countries, including the 
United States, as one of achieving cooperation and mutual 
understanding in all fields. In light of this, why has the 
U.S. Senate recently approved the establishment of Radio Free 
Asia again with the intention of beaming news broadcasts to 
China, Myanmar [Burma], Tibet, the DPRK, Cambodia, Vietnam, and 
the Lao People's Democratic Republic? It has said with a 
straight face that the residents of these countries have not had 
full freedom to express their views. It has also noted that 
Radio Free Asia will serve as a tool to gather views in 
different fields from the people of those countries. This may 
not be the true purpose of Radio Free Asia. There must be others. 
  It is difficult to answer this question. The questioner 
himself has not mentioned a correct answer. Nevertheless, radio 
experts are of the view that the new Radio Free Asia broadcasts 
will create interference on frequencies used by broadcasters in 
various countries in this region. Radio Free Asia has also 
reprimanded various nations in the region by saying that they 
have not maintained full rights and freedom of people to express 
their views. 
  The Lao people, like the peoples of other Indochinese 
countries, China, Myanmar, Tibet, and the DPRK, already enjoy 
full rights and freedom of expression. They can freely speak on 
whatever they want without needing Radio Free Asia. They have 
also exercised the rights to effectively safeguard their 
sovereignty and territorial integrity by opposing outside 
intervention and aggression under various forms. 
  Economically, the United States has announced the end of the 
trade embargo against Vietnam. It has done a precious thing. 
Why has it now announced the establishment of Radio Free Asia? 
Spiritually, this contradicts the economic interest of the 
peoples in the region. 
  BBC radio, in its broadcast of 29 January, expressed the 
view 
that the United States wants to set up Radio Free Asia because 
of its experience with its Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty 
contributing to the collapse of communism in Europe four to five 
years ago. If the BBC is correct, the new Radio Free Asia will 
not be characterized at all by creativity. Its purpose also 
runs counter to the earnest aspirations of the nations in this 
region, which want to create mutual understanding and promote 
and expand cooperation in various fields with all countries in 
the world, including the United States. 
  Generally, no matter what is behind the establishment of 
Radio Free Asia, if the owner of a radio station fails to 
understand the essential requirements, the true purpose of the 
establishment of the station will certainly be clear to the 
world in the future. The peoples in the region--the targets of 
the broadcasts--will even enhance their spirit of self-mastery 
and the spirit of being the owners of their countries, 
strengthening their cooperation in various fields to check all 
acts of outside intervention regardless of the form.

  [Excerpts] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said he would 
meet his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen on February 27 and 
expressed confidence that relations with Beijing would not be 
affected by the recent visit to Thailand of Taiwan's president. 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong said he would meet Mr Qian during the 
Chinese 
foreign minister's stopover in Bangkok and, if need be use the 
opportunity to clarify any problems. [passage omitted] Earlier 
in the day, Sqn Ldr Prasong said he had instructed Permanent 
Secretary for Foreign Affairs Pracha Khunakasem to clarify the 
country's stance with the Chinese embassy, and the Government 
itself was ready to confirm the policy. "The visit of Taiwanese 
President is like that of the Dalai Lama during which China also 
protested to the Thai Government," said Sqn Ldr Prasong. 
[passage omitted] 
  Foreign Minister Prasong reiterated that Thailand's 
one-China 
policy did not bar Thai people and businesses from making 
contact with the Taiwanese regarding commerce and trade affairs 
or at a personal level. The minister noted that there was no 
official welcoming ceremony for the Taiwanese president when he 
arrived in Bangkok on Wednesday. He also said Dr Amnuai did not 
receive Mr Li in the capacity of a senior official. 
  He said people who went to meetings with the Taiwanese 
president were not from the Cabinet, which belongs the executive 
branch, but from the Parliament which is regarded as the 
legislative branch. 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong said he was happy to clarify the matter with 
the House Foreign Affairs Committee at their invitation about 
his involvement in the matter if he was available during that 
time. If not, he would instruct the permanent secretary to go 
instead. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The approval of all member states would be 
needed for ASEAN to invite Burma to attend as a guest at the 
group's annual conference of foreign ministers, Singapore 
Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar said yesterday. Singapore would 
have no objections if the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
was to reach a consensus on the matter, he said. [passage 
omitted] 
  Mr Jayakumar described as "not finalised" Singapore Prime 
Minister Goh Chok Tong's plan to visit Rangoon. Mr Jayakumar's 
comments came after a U.S. congressman said he believed it would 
be "premature" for ASEAN to invite Burma if there were no talks 
between now and July between Burma's opposition leader Aung San 
Suu Kyi and the military junta's key member Lt Gen Khin Nyunt. 
Bill Richardson (Democrat-New Mexico) was replying to a 
reporter's question during a press conference on Wednesday after 
he became the first non-family member to be allowed to meet Suu 
Kyi in Rangoon. By July, the charismatic Burmese leader also 
will have been under house arrest for five years, normally the 
limit allowed by Burmese law. 
  Foreign Minister Sqn Ldr Prasong Sunsiri earlier spoke of 
the 
possibility of Thailand, as this year's chairman of ASEAN, 
inviting Burma to the meeting of the group's foreign ministers. 
He raised the possibility after the last ASEAN foreign 
ministers' meeting in Singapore. Sqn Ldr Prasong yesterday 
described the meeting between the U.S. congressman and Suu Kyi 
as an indication of improvements in Burma. But he said it would 
be "Burma's affair" whether or not the ruling State Law and 
Order Restoration Council kept Suu Kyi under house arrest until 
at least next year. 
  The Thai foreign ministry wanted to see better conditions in 
Burma before moving to invite Rangoon to attend the ASEAN 
meeting. The release of Suu Kyi was among a number of 
improvements sought. But Thai foreign ministry officials 
expressed confidence that there was still time for ASEAN to 
decide on the matter. Senior officials of ASEAN would not rush 
into the decision but closely monitor the situation in that 
country, a foreign ministry source said. 
  One senior foreign ministry source described the U.S. 
congressman's remark on the question as an attempt by a U.S. 
politician to dictate to other countries in international 
politics. 
  Meanwhile, the Singaporean foreign minister said he would 
like to see Thailand and Singapore work closely for "ASEAN 
interests" in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
group. Mr Jayakumar said there were no controversial issues 
between Thailand and Singapore.

  [Excerpts] An effective financial system for the export 
sector is one of key measures to increase the competitiveness of 
Thai products, and that is why the Government established the 
Export-Import Bank of Thailand, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai 
said yesterday. 
  In a speech marking the Exim Bank's official opening, Mr 
Chuan said the bank would provide financial services to the 
export sector, particularly those services not yet offered by 
other financial institutions. These could include medium- and 
long-term financing for some specific export products, export 
insurance and guarantees. New and small exporters in particular 
stand to benefit from the expanded services and additional 
sources of working capital. 
  The Premier said the insurance service would increase 
exporters' confidence in expanding their markets. [passage 
omitted] 
  The Government believes that on any issues Thailand's 
trading 
partners consider unfair, Thailand must listen and address them 
appropriately, the Premier said. 
  "But we will not give in to unreasonable demands from any 
particular countries. Therefore any concessions we make will be 
in agreement with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade." 
  By following this line, Thailand has left the Priority 
Foreign Country list and is now on a Priority Watch List. Under 
the latter, Washington cannot retaliate promptly; the worst it 
could do is return Thailand to PFC status, Mr Chuan said. 
  Commenting on the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations, he 
said 
the Government realises the importance of international trade 
regulations and the need for a central agency. Such an agency, 
he said, can be a haven for small countries such as Thailand in 
international trade negotiations. "Now that the GATT negotiation 
is complete the Government is determined to follow the GATT 
agreement closely. We will strictly abide by the rules and 
demand the same thing from other countries." [passage omitted] 
"Although we try to avoid any adverse consequences, sometimes we 
have to make sacrifices on some issues or else our trading 
partners can use it as an excuse to make trade retaliations 
which will cost us more." [passage omitted] 
  Prime Minister Chuan recalled that when he attended the Asia 
Pacific Economic Cooperation group summit in Seattle last 
November, last year, he was determined to show the world that 
Thailand believed in the spirit of economic cooperation among 
Asia-Pacific countries on technology transfer, personnel 
development and investment in the region. The Government is also 
firmly committed to the success of AFTA the ASEAN Free Trade 
Area, he said. 
  "We will not only pursue the policy of the preceding 
governments but will speed up the procedures so that AFTA can 
accomplish its objectives sooner. Moreover we will increase the 
number of products listed in AFTA cooperation, which we believe 
other member countries will agree with." [passage omitted]

  [Text] The negotiations between Thailand and the United 
States on double taxation failed to reach agreement. The U.S. 
wanted an agreement that was spelled out clearly, while the Thai 
side conducted the negotiations flexibly. The Thai side will 
review its position in the new round of talks scheduled for 
mid-October. 
  Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin said he received a 
report 
from the Revenue Department's M.R. Chatumongkon Sonakun, who 
negotiated on a double taxation protocol in the United States 
7-11 February. According to Chatumongkon, negotiations did not 
achieve desired results. He attributed this to the U.S. side 
wanting the Thai side to base the negotiations on legal 
references or clear terms because it had to submit the finished 
protocol--a legal documen--for congressional consideration. 
Vagueness could result in rejection by the congress. 
  Chatumongkon said the Thai side engaged in negotiations 
ready 
to compromise in certain areas, and it did indeed compromise on 
several points. However, the United States insisted that the 
Thai side produce a legal document spelling out every point, 
including permanent business establishment, business, and 
investment taxes. The negotiations failed as a result. 
  Chatumongkon said the Thai side will have to review the 
double taxation protocol in two areas. First, Thailand will 
have to draft a clear protocol for a new round of talks in 
mid-October. Second, Thailand has to assess whether the United 
States really wants to conclude a protocol. This is because the 
failure of previous negotiations was largely caused by the 
United States wanting Thailand to alter numerous points or 
shifting its positions constantly.

  [Text] The committee in charge of the study of the 
supportive measures for insurance liberalization agreed that the 
foreign shares limit in Thai insurance firms be raised, and the 
number of insurance companies in the country should be increased. 
  Sanit Worapanya, deputy permanent secretary of Commerce 
Ministry, disclosed that the increase in the foreign 
shareholding limit required amendment of the law to allow this 
to be raised to 49 percent while the ministerial regulation must 
be issued to fix the annual increase rate of the shareholding. 
He said it is time to increase the number of insurance firms in 
the country to pave the way for a major readjustment in line 
with the new GATT agreement which is to become effective soon. 
He said: 
  [Begin Sanit recording] The committee agreed during the 
meeting that the law has to be amended to limit foreign shares 
to 49 percent. Meanwhile, a ministerial regulation is needed to 
fix the annual increase rate of the foreign share limit. For 
example, the law will state that the limit during the first five 
years is fixed at not more than 40 percent, and the limit will 
be further expanded after that. Take this year for example, the 
foreign shareholding limit will remain at 40 percent until 1999 
and be raised to 49 percent in 2002. The annual increase will 
be stipulated in the ministerial regualtion. All members agreed 
that Thailand can no longer close its insurance market, and 
therefore, it must allow more insurance companies to operate in 
Thailand. The secretary of the committee has been assigned to 
consult with the private sector, mass media, and the 20 
representatives of consumers we invited to attend this meeting 
to figure out the exact number of companies to be allowed to do 
business. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Wassana Nanuam] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Cabinet insistence on Tuesday that the Air 
Force must purchase transportation planes only through the 
barter trade system is the first clear sign that cracks are 
beginning to appear in the relationship between the government 
and the military. [passage omitted] 
  Observers said the Cabinet move was seen as an attempt to 
prevent top brass, who traditionally ink the deals, from 
receiving kickbacks worth millions of baht or much more. 
  Chuan was less than totally clear about what he had in mind. 
But apparently aware of dissatisfaction among the top brass, he 
said the barter system would be employed on a case-by-case 
basis. "It is not mandatory," the prime minister insisted. But 
Chuan has seemed to be trying to distance himself from his vague 
"case-by-case" purchase policy. The issue became more ambiguous 
when he said the food-for-arms plan was not his own idea but 
that of former Navy Chief Adm Wichet Karunyawanit. [passage 
omitted] 
  Tension escalated after the Cabinet insisted that the Air 
Force's plan to buy six G222 transport planes from Italy, a 
Bt3.42 billion purchase, would not fall in the "not mandatory" 
category as defined by Chuan. "The Defence Ministry must 
cooperate with the agriculture, the foreign and the commerce 
ministries to persuade Italy to buy Thai goods in return," 
stated a Cabinet resolution. 
  The Air Force is determined to get the new aircraft, saying 
its present fleet of C123 transporters has been in commission 
for more than 30 years. "They (old model planes) should be 
decommissioned," an Air Force official, who asked not to be 
identified, said. 
  He said an Italian firm has already agreed to waive about 
Bt41 million in training fees in order to help Thailand close 
the deal. "I really don't see a way-out at the moment. I can't 
see how Italy could possibly agree with our proposal in its 
present form. I mean, what kind of agricultural produce do the 
Italians need from Thailand," the source said. He said he did 
not understand why the government had made the decision despite 
observations from officers that it would be difficult to 
negotiate a deal. "How can we, the military, negotiate the deal? 
It's impossible. We can't do it. Our only hope resides with the 
Commerce Ministry. But I really don't see the Italians giving it 
the nod," he commented. He also questioned the motives behind 
the resolution. 
  Commander of the Air Force Siriphong Thongyai reacted calmly 
towards the decision by saying "it is natural if there are other 
conditions to think about it (before buying the planes)."

  [Text] With a common desire to strengthen good bilateral 
relations and create a mechanism to develop cooperation for 
mutual benefit, Thailand and the Republic of Uzbekistan have 
been negotiating to establish a joint commission to promote 
bilateral cooperation. On 8 February the cabinet assigned the 
foreign minister to sign the agreement on the formation of the 
joint commission with the Republic of Uzbekistan during the 
official visit of a high-level delegation from Uzbekistan from 
15 to 17 February. The delegation is the first 
ministerial-level team from Uzbekistan to visit Thailand since 
that country gained its independence and seceded from the former 
Soviet Union in late 1991. Uzbekistan has shown its intention 
of having the agreement signed during the visit. 
  Therefore, the foreign ministry organized a signing ceremony 
on 16 February. Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri 
and the first deputy minister of the Uzbek Ministry of Foreign 
Relations signed the agreement on behalf of their respective 
governments. Uzbekistan is a new country in Central Asia with 
political stability and high economic potential. The joint 
commission is a mechanism to promote bilateral cooperation on 
economic issues, investment, and other issues in the interests 
of both countries.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 KYODO -- Japan should keep calm over 
the aggressive U.S. trade stance, Minister of International 
Trade and Industry Hiroshi Kumagai said Friday [18 February]. 
He made the comment in response to U.S. President Bill 
Clinton's statement on Thursday that the U.S. will pursue an 
"much more aggressive policy" to push Japanese markets open. 
  Clinton said he would try "different things" to achieve the 
goal of opening Japan's markets. 
  Kumagai told reporters after a regular cabinet meeting that 
the U.S. has often adopted such an attitude, even against old 
allies like Britain, when trade talks were deadlocked.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from "NHK News" program] </F>
  [Excerpts] In the House of Representatives' Budget 
Committee meeting that opened today, 18 February, Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa spoke about moves in the United States to take 
sanctions against Japan, and said the government is hurrying to 
prepare Japan's measures to open up its market -- including 
those to ensure improved transparency in procedures for 
government procurement and to step up deregulation. [passage 
omitted on a Dietman's question] 
  [Begin Hosokawa recording] In the areas of improving 
transparancy in procedures on insurance and government 
procurement, cooperation of Japanese and U.S. industries in 
automobiles, deregulation -- of which you too just said 
easygoing action will not be accepted -- or promoting imports 
and investments in Japan, I think we must be positive in all our 
actions. [end recording] 
  Masahiro Koga of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] then asked 
him about U.S. President Bill Clinton's criticism of Japan's 
economy-related government offices in reference to the failure 
of the Japan-U.S. economic consultations. The President cited 
the names of the government offices in making the criticism. In 
reply to the question, Prime Minister Hosokawa said the recent 
negotiations were not led by government officials, and the 
officials had to endure a lot during the negotiations. Setting 
numerical targets would lead to managed trade, and, hence, goes 
against the national interests of Japan. It is only natural 
that the people oppose it, whether they be politicians or 
bureaucrats. The prime minister thus said such criticism is not 
appropriate. [passage on remarks by others present at the 
meeting omitted]

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa suggested Friday [18 February] that Japan may send a 
special envoy to the United States in an effort to avert U.S. 
economic sanctions in the wake of last week's breakdown of 
bilateral trade "framework" talks. Hosokawa, speaking at a 
session of the House of Representatives budget committee, vowed 
to do his utmost to prevent relations between Japan and the U.S. 
from worsening. 
  The prime minister was replying to Michio Watanabe of the 
main opposition Liberal Democratic Party, who urged the prime 
minister to send an emissary to Washington in an effort to 
prevent Japan from being internationally "isolated." 
  Hosokawa and all his 20 cabinet ministers were present as 
the 
lower house's budget committee started deliberations on a third 
supplementary budget for fiscal 1993, which calls for a spending 
increase of 2,185.2 billion yen over the second revised budget. 
  This is designed to cover the largest-ever economic stimulus 
package of 15.25 trillion yen, and an increase in the overall 
general account budget for the current year ending in March to 
77,437.50 billion yen. 
  Besides the former foreign minister, nine legislators from 
both ruling and opposition parties posed questions. 
  While pledging efforts to rectify Japan's huge trade 
imbalance with the U.S., the prime minister urged Washington to 
make "a conscientious decision and response" to Japan. 
  Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton met last week in 
Washington, but failed to strike a deal on a new framework to 
slash Japan's trade surplus of over 50 billion dollars. 
  The collapse of the talks stemmed from a disagreement over a 
U.S. demand to set numerical targets to measure the openness of 
Japanese markets. Japan rejected the demand which it said would 
lead to managed trade. 
  A few days after the collapse of the framework talks, the 
U.S. on Tuesday unveiled steps to impose sanctions worth 
hundreds of millions of dollars in a dispute over access to the 
Japanese cellular phone market. At the budget committee 
session, Hosokawa reaffirmed that Tokyo will file a complaint 
with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) if the 
U.S. implements sanctions, but he also said Japan will deal 
with the situation "with a cool head." 
  Hosokawa said that Japan has to make its own efforts on both 
macroeconomic and microeconomic problems because it plays a 
large role in leading the world economy. "Japan must tackle 
what it can voluntarily...such as making procedures transparent 
for insurance and government procurement, promoting cooperation 
between the two countries' auto industries, deregulating the 
economy, accelerating imports and investments, and securing 
competition," Hosokawa said. 
  International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai 
told the same session that Japan will draw up a program by the 
end of February at the earliest to orient Japan's economic 
structure more towards domestic demand. 
  Hosokawa rejected U.S. criticism that "bureaucrats" have led 
the trade negotiations, saying that officials of each ministry 
made considerable effort to protect national interests. 
  He said neither politicians nor bureaucrats can accept the 
U.S. demand for numerical targets. "We cannot accept a demand 
that runs counter to economic deregulation," he stated. 
  Hosokawa also said Japan will act with responsibility if the 
United Nations Security Council imposes economic sanctions 
against North Korea over its suspected nuclear arms development 
program. 
  Both Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura 
said they have good relations in spite of reports that the 
premier wants to remove Takemura from his post.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 KYODO -- A senior 
telecommunications official said Friday [18 February] it is up 
to the private sector to resolve a dispute between Japan and the 
United States over U.S. access to Japan's cellular telephone 
market. 
  Yoshio Utsumi, director general of the Posts and 
Telecommunications Ministry's International Affairs Department, 
made the comment while briefing foreign reporters on Japan's 
position on the matter. 
  An official at the department confirmed the content of 
Utsumi's remarks at the briefing but said they were not as 
strong as had been reported. 
  AP-DOW JONES NEWS SERVICE reported that Utsumi warned that 
Motorola Inc.'s business in Japan could suffer if the company 
and the U.S. Government picked an "unnecessary" fight about the 
need for immediate results. 
  The ministry official said the tone of the U.S. wire 
service's report was too strong. "He (Utsumi) did not make such 
a warning. That story seems a little strong," the official said. 
  The U.S. Government said earlier this week it plans to 
impose sanctions against Japan for violating a 1989 bilateral 
cellular telephone agreement. 
  The agreement paved the way for Motorola to offer cellular 
telephones in the densely populated corridor between Tokyo and 
Nagoya on the basis of its own system. 
  Japanese officials say Tokyo has fulfilled its 
responsibilities to abide by the agreement, but the U.S. side 
complains that implementation of the agreement has effectively 
discriminated against Motorola.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Friday [18 February] that Japan will do whatever 
it can to rectify its huge trade imbalance with the United 
States. 
  It is natural that both Japan and the U.S. should make 
efforts but Japan has to make its own efforts on both 
macroeconomic and microeconomic problems in view of the fact 
that this country plays a large role in leading the world 
economy, Hosokawa said during a session of the House of 
Representatives' budget committee. 
  The powerful lower house started deliberation on a third 
supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 which calls for a spending 
increase of 2,185.2 billion yen over the second revised budget, 
to cover the largest-ever economic stimulus package of 15.25 
trillion yen, and an increase of the overall general account 
budget for the current year ending in March to 77,437.50 billion 
yen. 
  Commenting on last week's breakdown in the Japan-U.S. 
"Framework trade" talks in Washington, Hosokawa said that it was 
regrettable the two countries could not reach an accord, but 
that both sides agreed not to let the issue disrupt friendly 
relations between Japan and the U.S. 
  Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton failed to agree on 
trade negotiations aimed at reducing Japan's bloated trade 
surplus and opening its markets to U.S. firms. 
  "Japan must tackle what it can voluntarily...such as making 
procedures transparent for insurance and government procurement, 
promoting cooperation between the two countries' auto 
industries, deregulating the economy, accelerating imports and 
investments, and securing competition," Hosokawa said. 
  He made the remarks in response to questions by Shigeru 
Goto, 
a lower house legislator of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), 
the leading bloc of the seven-party ruling coalition. 
  The prime minister expressed his hope that the U.S. would 
act 
with sensible judgment, referring to recent U.S. moves toward 
retaliatory measures against Japan following the failure of the 
framework talks. 
  On U.S. criticism that "bureaucrats" have led the 
negotiations on Japan's side, Hosokawa denied the charge, saying 
that though the officials of each ministry made considerable 
effort to protect national interests, neither the politicians 
nor the bureaucrats can accept the U.S. "stance against economic 
deregulation."

to frontload its 10-year, 430 trillion yen public investment 
project as a means of reducing the country's trade surplus, a 
government source said Friday [18 February]. 
  "There is no such possibility," the source said. 
  He also said the government will not move to set any 
specific 
targets to help reduce the surplus. 
  "We will make efforts through easing of regulations," he 
said, emphasizing that the government's policies will be focused 
on deregulation and increased imports as annouced Thursday.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 KYODO -- Japan's top economic 
planner on Friday [18 February] urged the government to quickly 
formulate measures to reduce its huge trade surplus. 
  It is "very important" for economic-related ministries to 
craft measures that would lead to a "visible" reduction in black 
ink within half a year, Economic Planning Agency director 
general Manae Kubota told a news conference. 
  Kubota proposed a regular monitoring of Japan's trade 
balance, for example on a monthly basis. 
  She said the EPA, as part of surplus-cutting efforts, wants 
to formulate ways to improve access to Japanese markets and 
narrow the gap between domestic and overseas prices. 
  Measures should be worked out before the finance ministers 
of 
the Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations get together in 
Germany on February 26, she said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 KYODO -- Recent currency movements 
have been excessive, Bank of Japan governor Yasushi Mieno said 
Friday [18 February], stressing that industrial nations agree on 
exchange rate stability. 
  Referring to recent trends in the foreign exchange market, 
which saw the dollar plummet nearly 6 percent Monday and Tuesday 
on trade woes, Mieno told a Diet panel that "the movements have 
gone too far." 
  Answering questions in the House of Representatives budget 
committee, he stressed an agreement is still in effect among the 
Group of Seven (G-7) leading industrial nations that calls for 
exchange rates to move in a stable fashion reflecting economic 
fundamentals. 
  Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii made the same point earlier 
in the morning. 
  Mieno said he wants to work in close contact with other G-7 
members for exchange rate stability. Tokyo currency dealers 
reiterated Friday that the Bank of Japan appeared to be 
intervening in the market, selling the yen. 
  Mieno also appeared to quash expectations that the central 
bank will soon cut its already record low official discount rate 
to spur the economy. 
  If capital stock and other adjustments proceed smoothly, 
"current interest rate levels are sufficient to support an 
economic recovery," he said. 
  He repeated that the economic picture is a mix of good and 
bad, citing recent yen gains and gradually worsening employment 
conditions as minuses, pitted against the expected effects of 
last week's record 15.25 trillion yen fiscal stimulus package.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 KYODO -- A top government economist 
said Friday [18 February] it is desirable that the U.S. dollar 
rise back above 110 yen for the time being. 
  Tsutomu Tanaka, administrative vice minister at the Economic 
Planning Agency, told reporters that the yen's latest advance 
against the dollar is somewhat excessive in light of economic 
fundamentals in Japan and the United States. "I'm concerned 
that this level will linger and do damage to economic recovery," 
he noted. 
  The dollar finished at 104.57 yen in Tokyo Friday, up 1.09 
yen from Thursday's close but still far below the 110 yen level 
seen before the weekend Japan-U.S. summit in Washington.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 KYODO -- The yen's rise could 
undermine Japan's economy just as it is starting to show some 
signs of a recovery, the head of a life insurers' association 
said Friday [18 February]. 
  "Sales declines (in such consumer fields as) automobiles, 
department stores and life insurance policies have slowed 
recently although uncertainties remain over whether these can be 
judged as signs of a full-fledged (economic) recovery," Toshiomi 
Uragami told a regular press meeting. 
  But the chairman of the Life Insurance Association of Japan 
stressed, "the yen's appreciation will put a damper" on such 
movements. 
  "We must take (the yen's rise) calmly instead of falling 
into 
confusion," added Uragami, head of an industry which is also 
Japan's largest institutional investor. 
  The dollar plunged against the yen after Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton failed to 
reach agreement in so-called framework trade talks at their 
weekend meeting in Washington. 
  Uragami said, "it's extremely regrettable," but the failure 
was "inevitable" in the wake of the strong U.S. demand for 
"numerical targets." 
  He reiterated that numerical targets lead to "managed 
trade," 
and are especially inapplicable in the insurance field, as 
opposed to government procurement. 
  The summit was intended to reach an agreement on three 
priority fields -- insurance, automobiles and auto parts, and 
government procurement of telecommunications and medical 
equipment. 
  With the U.S. economy in recovery and the Japanese economy 
remaining weak, "(the bilateral) trade imbalance was apt to 
swell," Uragami said, adding that the situation is poised to 
change with Japan's economy about to pick up. 
  He welcomed the government's latest economic measures, 
including the record 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package, income 
tax cuts, and the economy-oriented budget for fiscal 1994. 
  Uragami gave a mark of 70 out of 100 to those measures, and 
said he deducted 30 because more spending would be favorable to 
"really jump-start" the economy. 
  Referring to plans by nonlife insurers to hold 
business-level 
discussions with the U.S. side, Uragami said his association 
already has foreign-affiliated life insurers among its members, 
and both informal and formal talks have been conducted. 
  In press remarks Thursday, Takashi Onoda, chairman of the 
Marine and Fire Insurance Association of Japan, said nonlife 
insurers intend to hold top-level and other discussions to 
deepen understanding. 
  Meanwhile, Uragami said the recent ongoing moves by life 
insurers to lower their rates on insurance policies for the 
second consecutive year are a decision "ultimately" reflecting 
the interest gap with market rates. 
  He brushed aside any connection with nonperforming loans at 
housing and other financial institutions related to life 
insurers. He said, "there is no plan now" for pension 
insurance, but it could be considered.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 KYODO -- The benefits of the yen's 
appreciation are not being fully passed on to consumers in 
revised import prices, two government surveys showed Friday [18 
February]. 
  Customs-cleared import prices for 30 selected items in 
December fell a weighted average of 4.7 percent from a year 
earlier, with 27 items declining and 17 posting double-digit 
declines, the Finance Ministry reported. 
  The fall reflected the dollar's average 12.7 percent decline 
to 108.35 yen for the month, and declines of more than 30 
percent were seen for French wine, Italian shirts and many other 
items denominated in other currencies that dropped more than the 
dollar against the yen, a ministry official said. 
  He noted that higher prices in three items and relatively 
low 
declines for 13 items came chiefly on supply shortage and yen- 
denominated contracts. 
  Meanwhile, the Economic Planning Agency reported that retail 
prices for imported goods fell for only 14 products in January 
while 18 of 20 surveyed items posted declines in customs-cleared 
prices in December. 
  Retail prices for 12 items, including wine and shirts, 
posted 
lower declines than customs-cleared prices, and two items 
remained unchanged despite lower customs prices, the agency said. 
  Moreover, it said consumers saw price increases in 
grapefruit 
and subcompact passengers cars although customs officers saw 
lower prices in the two items.

  [Text] Nagoya, Feb. 18 KYODO -- Toyota Motor Corp. will 
provide full technological assistance to a Chinese automaker 
with an eye to future business opportunities in the potentially 
vast market for cars there, Toyota officials said Friday [18 
February]. 
  The officials said the top carmaker in Japan will extend 
more 
comprehensive support to Shenyang Jinbei Passenger Vehicle 
Manufacturing Co. in Shenyang, Liaoning Province. 
  Under a technological transfer agreement reached in 1989, 
Nagoya- based Toyota has technologically assisted the firm, its 
only Chinese partner, in assembling its Hiace van. 
  The Shenyang firm, which started operations in 1991, 
produced 
4,400 units of the commercial vehicle in 1993 and plans to boost 
output to 20,000 units in 1995. 
  The Toyota move came as Japanese makers are lagging far 
behind Western rivals in making entry into the Chinese market, 
which Beijing plans to expand to a size of two million units a 
year by the year 2000, four times of the present scale, with aid 
from foreign makers. 
  A Toyota official said the Chinese market is indeed 
"attractive in the future" and that "there is an urgent need to 
boost our technological help for our Chinese partner." 
  The Toyota official said the details of the planned 
assistance have yet to be worked out, but will probably involve 
technological advice on more complicated parts of the car such 
as steering mechanisms and accelerators. 
  The officials also said Toyota plans to help the partner 
manufacture not only commercial vehicles but also passenger cars 
in the future. 
  As a step toward that, they said, the company plans stronger 
links with Gold Cup Automobile Corp., the parent of the Shenyang 
firm, through capital participation.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 KYODO -- The Japanese Foreign 
Ministry said Friday [18 February] it hopes a meeting between 
Myanmar's [Burma] ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council 
(SLORC) and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi will take place 
and pave the way for her release. 
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada told a press 
conference Japan welcomes the fact that U.S. Congressman William 
Richardson was able to meet Suu Kyi as the first nonfamily 
member to do so since her house arrest in 1989. 
  Terada quoted Richardson as saying Suu Kyi expressed a wish 
to hold high-level talks with SLORC and that the first secretary 
of SLORC also hinted at the possibility of such talks. 
  "We naturally hope to see the dialogue take place and that 
it 
will be a step forward for an early solution of problems, 
including the release of Aung San Suu Kyi," he said. 
  But he referred to a press briefing by SLORC on Tuesday in 
which it said Suu Kyi will be detained until next year, and said 
the Japanese Government would "regret this very much" if such is 
the case. 
  Richardson, a Democrat from New Mexico, met Suu Kyi on 
February 14 and 15. 
  Suu Kyi, leader of the National League for Democracy which 
won the national general election in May 1990, has been confined 
at her house in Yangon [Rangoon] since July 1989.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii said Friday [18 February] a 10 million yen donation to him 
from a salt wholesalers group last August was a "gratuity for 
services." 
  Fujii was replying at the day's session of the House of 
Representatives budget committee in response to an opposition 
questioner, who pressed him to account for the money from the 
Enyu- Kai, an association of salt wholesalers, whose business is 
under the supervision of the Finance Ministry. 
  Fujii said, "the money was a gratuity for my services, as I 
retired from a post in the industry association." 
  The finance minister said he worked for the body "since 1976 
or 1977," and that he returned the money "so that it would not 
trigger misunderstanding." 
  The questioner, Takashi Fukaya of the Liberal Democratic 
Party, said that Fujii contravened a legal obligation to report 
to tax authorities the acceptance of the money "as personal 
income." 
  Fujii earlier said he reported the money as an untaxable 
political donation to the Home Affairs Ministry. He said his 
two officially registered political fund-raising organizations 
received the money last August. 
  The Enyu-Kai is an affiliate of the Association of Salt 
Dealers' Cooperatives, to which Fujii had served as a longtime 
adviser. It acts as a "political organization" for salt 
wholesalers. 
  Fujii said, "there is nothing wrong in the fact that money 
exchanged hands between these political organizations." 
  Fujii, now a key figure in Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] 
spearheaded by Ichiro Ozawa, a chief strategist of the ruling 
coalition, was an LDP legislator until last June, when he and 
dozens of other LDP lawmakers renounced the scandal-tainted 
party to form Shinseito. 
  The YOMIURI SHIMBUN, the nation's largest-circulating daily, 
reported on Tuesday that the industry body gave the donation in 
congratulating him on being given the post of finance minister 
in a cabinet formation last August.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa on Friday [18 February] denied reports that he and 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura are at loggerheads 
and that he wants to remove Takemura from the key cabinet post. 
"We are not hostile to each other at all and we are in very 
close contact," the premier said at a session of the House of 
Representatives budget committee in response to opposition 
questioner Michio Watanabe. 
  Takemura told the same session, "I think we are on good 
terms. I don't think we are on bad terms." 
  Hosokawa was responding to a question as to why he sounded 
out Hiroyuki Sonoda, a senior legislator of the Sakigake 
(Harbinger) group founded by Takemura, on whether he is ready to 
take over as a cabinet member in case Takemura cannot remain in 
the cabinet. 
  Watanabe, a former foreign minister, pressed Hosokawa to 
clarify "whether you want to replace your chief cabinet 
secretary." "Why did your relations deteriorate?" He asked. 
  Hosokawa told the session many press reports are wrong. 
  But later on Friday, Hosokawa attended a reception for 
members of his Japan New Party and said, "my reformist 
administration is over. It has entered a second stage." 
  Political analysts said Hosokawa implied an intention to 
reorganize the cabinet by saying that his administration has 
entered a new stage. 
  Earlier this week, speculation ran high that Hosokawa will 
carry out an early cabinet reshuffle and remove Takemura from 
the post of chief cabinet secretary. On Monday the prime 
minister said he is considering to reshape the cabinet, launched 
last August. 
  Faced with strong opposition from Takemura's Sakigake and 
the 
Social Democratic Party, the biggest group in Hosokawa's 
seven-party coalition, Hosokawa retreated later and said 
Wednesday, "the issue is still a blank piece of paper and I am 
not working on the assumption that I should conduct it 
immediately." 
  Takemura, leader of the 14-member Sakigake, reportedly 
alienated Hosokawa and Shinseito co-leader Ichiro Ozawa over his 
opposition to the pair's proposal to slap a new 7 percent 
indirect tax on goods and services. 
  Ozawa, a key strategist in the ruling coalition, was 
reported 
late last year to have urged Hosokawa to remove Takemura from 
the key cabinet post. 
  Meanwhile, a senior official in Hosokawa's seven-party 
coalition denied that Sakigake is softening its opposition to 
the cabinet reshuffle and leaning toward accepting the removal 
of Takemura. He said Sakigake will not accept a proposal to 
transfer Takemura to another cabinet post if he gives in to 
pressure to quit the office of chief cabinet secretary, whose 
constant contacts with the press gives it special political 
advantages.

<F P=106> ["News analysis" by Takehiko Kajita: "Reshuffle Rift Stems </F>
From Icy Hosokawa-Takemura Ties"] 
  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 KYODO -- A rift in Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa's coalition government over a possible cabinet 
reshuffle reflects the premier's icy relations with his one-time 
closest ally. 
  The controversy stemming from Hosokawa's sudden scheme to 
shake up his six-month-old cabinet sent a chill wind through the 
government, raising further doubts about his capability as a 
leader. 
  In the face of unexpectedly fierce opposition from within 
his 
seven-party coalition, Hosokawa became cagey about his plan and 
said merely he had not decided whether to carry out a reshuffle 
or not. 
  He indicated Wednesday [16 February] he has no intention of 
reshaping the cabinet, at least until around early March, so as 
to focus on Diet discussion of the third supplementary budget 
for fiscal 1993 and on revisions to the political reforms that 
passed into law in January. 
  But the prime motive behind his perceived desire to 
reorganize his team is apparently to remove Masayoshi Takemura 
from the post of chief cabinet secretary. 
  It is now an open secret in Nagatacho, Japan's political 
heart, that Hosokawa wants to ditch Takemura, regarded until 
only recently as his most important political associate, because 
he is disgruntled with the top government spokesman's seeming 
disobedience. 
  The turning point was apparently reached February 3, when 
Hosokawa abruptly unveiled a plan to create a 7 percent indirect 
tax on goods and services in place of the present 3 percent 
consumption tax to finance a huge income tax cut meant to boost 
the sluggish economy. 
  The premier was eventually forced to scrap his plan because 
of strong objections from within the coalition, but Takemura had 
criticized it at a news conference when he said, "It is never 
too late to mend one's ways." 
  Traditionally, the chief cabinet secretary is expected to be 
a loyal assistant to the premier, and Takemura's remarks were 
seen as tantamount to rebellion. 
  "The chief cabinet secretary should work as one with the 
premier," an aide to Hosokawa said. "I doubt if he (Takemura) 
is functioning as chief cabinet secretary." 
  Aside from Hosokawa's personal feelings, the plan to 
reshuffle the cabinet fueled speculation that the premier has 
tilted toward Ichiro Ozawa, a senior leader of Shinseito (Japan 
Renewal Party) and the main strategist in the coalition. 
  This means Hosokawa may have opted to team up with Ozawa and 
Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito, another major 
member of the coalition. While the Ozawa-Ichikawa duo want a 
drastic reconfiguration of political parties to establish a 
two-party system, Takemura and Hosokawa have said they prefer a 
moderate multiparty system. 
  Bickering between Takemura and Ozawa is nothing new. The two 
men have clashed over some key policy issues since the Hosokawa 
administration set sail last August as Japan's first coalition 
government in nearly four decades. 
  It was reported that Ozawa pressed Hosokawa to fire Takemura 
late last year, when Ozawa and Takemura were at loggerheads over 
the handling of the premier's cherished political reform bills 
and the timetable for formulating the fiscal 1994 state budget. 
  At the time, Hosokawa sided with Takemura, saying he is an 
indispensable member of the cabinet, according to a source close 
to the premier. 
  Both former prefectural governors, Hosokawa and Takemura 
have 
long fostered friendly relations and agreed on the "marriage" of 
the political parties they respectively head -- the Japan New 
Party (JNP) and Sakigake (Harbinger) -- in the immediate future. 
  But the love affair is over. The merger of the two parties 
seems almost impossible as Hosokawa's scheme to reshuffle the 
cabinet has incurred the distrust of Sakigake legislators. 
  "I feel we can no longer get along with Hosokawa," said a 
senior Sakigake official, who requested he not be identified. 
  One Sakigake source also said, "We will never again trust 
Hosokawa, who has driven Mr. Takemura into a corner like this." 
  It remains to be seen whether Hosokawa will reshape his 
cabinet in March or later. But if the premier goes ahead with a 
reshuffle including the dismissal of Takemura as chief cabinet 
secretary, he could face a serious test of his authority as 
Sakigake may move to distance itself from the coalition. 
  "If he forces a reshuffle, we will have to cooperate with 
the 
government from outside the cabinet," another Sakigake source 
said. "If Mr. Takemura is removed, we will not offer any 
replacement."

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's cabinet on Friday [18 February] adopted its platform 
for fiscal 1994 tax system revision, featuring income tax cuts 
and tax incentives for housing purchases to prop up the flagging 
economy. 
  The outline, endorsed at a morning cabinet meeting, is based 
on a tax revision framework produced by the ruling coalition 
parties and a report by the Tax Commission, an advisory panel to 
the prime minister, both issued earlier this month. 
  The government's package to amend tax laws will be submitted 
to the current ordinary Diet session. 
  The platform calls for tax cuts worth 4,391 billion yen but 
leaves out any decision on a possible consumption tax hike and 
other measures to finance the tax cuts. 
  The government "will continue discussing tax reform to 
realize it by the end of the year," it says. 
  The tax cuts comprise 3,843 billion yen in national income 
taxes, 172 billion yen in inheritance taxes, 306 billion yen in 
abolition of special corporate taxes, and 70 billion yen in 
reducing the 4.5 percent consumption tax rate on passenger cars 
to 3 percent. 
  The income tax cuts are limited to one year, and the 
reduction amount does not include planned local resident's tax 
cuts. 
  The platform recommends revising land and housing tax 
systems 
to stimulate the land market and facilitate home purchases, 
estimating tax breaks worth 15 billion yen. 
  To back smaller businesses, deadlines on special tax breaks 
on their streamlining investments will be extended for six 
months to three years. 
  Various unfair tax treatments are also subject to revision, 
including donations at nonprofit organizations and entertainment 
expenses on smaller companies. 
  On unexplained expenses that are said to be used by 
companies 
to write off political donations and bribes, the government is 
to impose a punitive levy of 40 percent on top of regular 
corporate tax, but this will be limited to a period between 
April 1, 1994 to March 31, 1998. 
  The outline also calls for higher liquor tax rates.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 KYODO -- Fresh data show subtle 
brightening in some facets of Japan's slumping economy, but no 
clear signals of recovery have emerged, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) 
said Friday [18 February]. 
  The central bank's monthly economic review adds the words 
"on 
the whole" to its assessment of weak personal consumption, 
indicating a few areas with "nuances" of improvement, while it 
deletes mention of strong public investment, a BOJ official said. 
  The bank stuck to its judgment that "Japan's economic growth 
remains weak and no clear indication of imminent recovery has 
been identified." 
  With overall consumption weak, final demand still lackluster 
and corporate capital investment still falling, "there has been 
virtually no growth in industrial production and shipments, and 
inventory adjustments have stalled," the report said. 
  Labor conditions also continue to worsen gradually, it said. 
  Private housing investment remains strong, but growth has 
slowed in public investment, another recent bright spot, 
especially compared to robust year-earlier growth, it said. 
  Some public works projects have been delayed as local 
governments change bidding practices in the wake of construction 
scandals. But the official declined to tie the slower public 
investment growth to the scandals. 
  Among personal consumption categories, "sales of washing 
machines and personal computers are picking up, and revenues at 
major travel agencies in December increased above last year's 
level," the report said. 
  The partial improvements may have been affected by stock 
adjustments of household durable goods, higher housing 
investment and new products matching consumers' downscale 
desires, it said. 
  But overall, "personal consumption remains weak against the 
backdrop of slower employment growth and limited income growth," 
with such factors as cuts in bonus and overtime pay, the report 
said. 
  Personal consumption cannot be judged to be recovering 
without stronger income growth, the BOJ official said. 
  Manufacturing capital investment continued to decline, 
despite rises to boost capacity in such areas as semiconductors 
and liquid crystals, the report said, citing excess capital 
stock, lower use of capacity, low profits and increased shifts 
of production overseas. 
  The report noted that Japan's trade and current-account 
surpluses have declined, with exports falling in real terms, 
partly reflecting last year's soaring yen, which moved in a 
111-113 yen range in January. 
  Its recent surge to six-month peaks came "as the market 
reacted to comments attributed to U.S. officials." The yen 
closed Friday in Tokyo at 104.57 yen.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 KYODO -- The government decided 
Friday [18 February] to maintain the current interest rate on 
welfare savings offered through private banks at an annual 4.15 
percent for the next one-year period. 
  The decision came at a morning cabinet meeting, Finance 
Minister Hirohisa Fujii told reporters. 
  The move is intended to help pensioners and the disabled 
amid 
the current trend for lower interest rates in line with 
progressing financial deregulations, Fujii said. 
  Private banks offer welfare savings with a relatively high 
fixed interest rate under the Finance Ministry's permission. 
  He noted that the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications 
is 
expected to take a similar measure for such savings offered by 
post offices.

  [Text] Fukui, Feb. 18 KYODO -- The No. 1 reactor at the 
Kansai Electric Power Co. nuclear plant in Mihama was shut down 
Friday [18 February] morning after a warning lamp indicated the 
radioactivity level in the secondary coolant water supply has 
increased. 
  The company reported an analysis of the secondary water 
revealed that pipes in one of the plant's steam-driven 
generators were damaged, which allowed some of the primary water 
to leak into the secondary water supply. 
  Officials from the Fukui prefectural governments's nuclear 
power safety division said that while traces of radioactivity 
may have escaped into the atmosphere in the steam, its 
radioactivity monitoring systems in the prefecture showed 
nothing unusual. 
  The officials declared that there was no effect on the 
immediate environment. 
  The warning lamp at the No. 1 reactor went off at 6:10 A.M. 
[2110 GMT 17 February] while the Mihama plant was in full 
operation. The Mihama reactor is a pressurized water reactor 
with an output of 340,000 kilowatts. 
  The company began reducing the output of the plant at 7:37 
A.M. and 52 minutes later shut down the reactor to examine the 
cause of the alarm. 
  According to the safety officials, the warning lamp was set 
off when the secondary water was supposed to return to water 
after being turned to steam but remained a vapor, causing a 
vacuum in the return pump. 
  It appears that there has been an increase of about 0.1 over 
the normal numerical value of the monitor, officials said. 
  The pressurized water reactor generates electricity with 
turbines driven by secondary water which has been turned into 
steam by the superheated primary water.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 KYODO -- A member of the House of 
Reprsentatives on Friday [18 February] accused the agricultural 
group Zenno of what she sees as dubious accounting on its trade 
in rice used to make miso (bean paste) and rice crackers. 
  Sumi Fujita of the Japanese Communist Party presented to the 
government a report which said that Zenno (the National 
Federation of Agricultural Cooperative Associations) failed to 
properly return to farmers its profits from sales of such rice. 
  Zenno is entrusted by the government to market non-table use 
rice. It buys the rice from growers at prices about 40 percent 
lower than those the government pays them. 
  Fujita said in the report that Zenno spent 28,627 million 
yen 
during the eight years from 1984 through 1991 as "costs for 
boosting demand" and "collection expenses." 
  She said these expenditures are "beyond a level the food 
agency permits, and should be returned to farmers as sales 
profits." 
  She also accused the government of neglecting to oversee 
Zenno's accounting. 
  Admitting that it has not monitored the transport and 
management costs involved in Zenno's sales activities, the food 
agency said it will investigate the accusation. 
  Zenno said, meanwhile, the problem has already been resolved 
and defended its accounting as being appropriate. 
  After a similar complaint made by Fujita in February last 
year, Zenno was eventually prompted to return 4,281 million yen 
to farmers.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 KYODO -- Japan's beef imports in the 
first nine months of fiscal 1993 already exceeded the record 
amount imported in the whole of fiscal 1992, the Agriculture, 
Forestry and Fisheries Ministry said in a preliminary report 
Friday [18 February]. 
  The ministry said imports in the April-December period 
totaled 437,000 tons, rising 25.7 percent from a year earlier 
and topping the annual record of 423,000 tons set in fiscal 1992. 
  Imports in fiscal 1993, ending March 31, are expected to 
total 550,000 tons, the ministry forecast. 
  Japan liberalized beef imports in 1991 and reduced tariffs 
in 
1992 and 1993. Imported beef is used mostly by restaurant 
chains. 
  The ministry said beef imports are expected to continue 
increasing in the coming years, since Japan agreed in December 
at the Uruguay Round of global trade talks to further reduce the 
tariffs to 38.5 percent from the present 50 percent in the six 
years beginning 1995.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 17 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the 
United States reaffirmed Thursday that resumption of 
inter-Korean dialogue is a prerequisite to the next round of 
North Korea-U.S. high-level talks. The high-level talks would 
have to completely resolve the North Korean nuclear dispute 
including special inspection of suspected facilities yet to be 
opened to the IAEA, they agreed. 
  This would entail a "comprehensive" solution to the problem, 
with full-scale nuclear inspections allowed by Pyongyang in 
exchange for permanent suspension of the South Korean-U.S. 
military exercise "Team Spirit" and improvement in North 
Korean-U.S. relations. 
  Visiting Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and U.S. officials 
confirmed there was no change in requirements for the high-level 
talks -- satisfactory nuclear inspections by the International 
Atomic energy agency (IAEA) in North Korea and substantial 
progress in inter-Korean talks such as an exchange of 
presidential envoys. Han is carrying a personal letter from 
President Kim Yong-sam which will be delivered when the foreign 
minister meets President Bill Clinton on Friday, just before his 
departure for Seoul. 
  While stating that the Seoul-Washington agreement reached at 
last November's summit calls for a "thorough and broad" approach 
to solving the North Korean nuclear problem, President Kim is 
said to have reiterated that the two Koreas must exchange envoys 
before the North Korea-U.S. meeting. 
  "The two countries concluded that North Korea's acceptance 
of 
IAEA inspections has allowed efforts to continue to solve the 
problem through dialogue," said Director-General for American 
Affairs Chang Chae-yong, accompanying Han in the United States. 
  "We concluded that our strategy of dialogue pursued under 
close consultations between South Korea and the United States is 
leading in the right direction," He said after Han's talks with 
U.S. Assistant Secretaries Peter Tarnoff and Lynn Davis. 
  Pyongyang ended a lengthy stalemate Tuesday when it 
announced 
it would accept IAEA inspection of all of its seven declared 
sites. An IAEA inspection team is expected to arrive in North 
Korea early next week and start two to three weeks of checks on 
whether Pyongyang has diverted nuclear material since the last 
inspection a year ago. 
  Han meets U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor later in 
the day to discuss bilateral economic issues and South Korea's 
participation in the North American Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA). He delivers a keynote speech at the opening of the 
South Korea-U.S. 21st Century Council on Friday morning before 
leaving for Seoul.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation from 17 
February ROK vernacular newspapers on reaction to North Korea's 
acceptance of nuclear inspections by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) and prospects for future developments in 
this issue. This topic is covered extensively by the vernacular 
press with CHOSON ILBO, TONG-A ILBO, HANGUK ILBO, KYONGHYANG 
SINMUN, SEOUL SINMUN, and HANGYORE SINMUN all carrying 
editorials and articles analyzing future development prospects. 
<H6>  REACTION </H6>
  The moderate CHOSON ILBO, TONG-A ILBO, and HANGUK ILBO 
newspapers carry 800-word editorials on page 3 welcoming North 
Korea's acceptance of the IAEA nuclear inspections but caution 
that although the emergency atmosphere has dissipated on the 
Korean peninsula due to North Korea's acceptance of nuclear 
inspection, it is too early in the negotiation process to expect 
too much from North Korea. 
  Pointing out that "the nuclear issue began with the IAEA's 
demand for special inspections [tukpyol sachal]," the CHOSON 
ILBO editorial entitled "No More Nuclear Games," says that "ad 
hoc and ordinary inspections [imsi mit tongsang sachal] on seven 
declared facilities are meaningless" and that "the developments 
in the nuclear issue will only be possible following special 
inspections." The editorial warns that if North Korea accepted 
the inspections to avoid UN Security Council's sanctions, it 
will only add to its image of being "an impossible country to 
deal with" and urges North Korea to keep in mind the "economic 
benefits" that are to be gained from the resolution of the 
nuclear issue. The editorial concludes by telling readers to 
wait until North Korea accepts special and mutual inspections 
[sangho sachal] between the North and the South. 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO editorial entitled "Still a Long 
Way 
To Go To Resolve North Korea's Nuclear Issue" chimes in with 
CHOSON ILBO by saying that "real negotiations begin when the 
issues of special inspection on two undeclared facilities and 
mutual inspections [sangho sachal] between the North and the 
South are discussed at the third round of the U.S.-North Korea 
talks," but adds that developments prove that North Korea only 
takes action when faced with "resolute measures [tanohan 
taecho]." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO editorial entitled "While 
Catastrophe Has Been Avoided on the North Korean Nuclear Issue" 
says that "although North Korea's avoidance of catastrophe and 
economic sanctions is to be praised, ...this does not mean a 
complete resolution of the nuclear issue." The editorial urges 
the government to be fully prepared for North Korea's tricks as 
the sudden change is part of a "meticulous, premeditated plan." 
  HANGUK ILBO's 800-word article by Paris correspondent Han 
Ki-pong on page 2, in analyzing the implications of the long 
drawn-out negotiations process, says that "no progress has been 
made from the starting point of negotiations a year ago," but 
that the resolution of conflict between North Korea and the 
international community is important in and of itself. 
  HANGUK ILBO carries an 800-word article by Choe Kyu-sik on 
page 4 on the ROK Government's view on North Korea's acceptance 
of nuclear inspections. While finding North Korea's decision 
"fortunate and welcoming," the government expressed its position 
that it is too early to be optimistic. The article says that 
the government hopes to have meaningful development in 
working-level contacts concerning the exchange of special envoys 
and to lead North Korea to completely return to the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] system following a successful 
third round of U.S.-North Korea talks regarding the special 
inspections [tukpyol sachal] of the two undeclared facilities. 
While the government does not interpret North Korea's 
acceptance of inspections to mean complete abandonment of 
nuclear development, it is not being interpreted as "a temporary 
step" to get out of the recent emergency situation, but as one 
official put it, "a meaningful breakthrough." This official is 
said to have noted that "it is a considerable development that 
North Korea accepted ad hoc inspections [imsi sachal] on two 
facilities when it had only allowed replacement of batteries and 
films." 
  On page 5, HANGUK ILBO carries a 700-word article by Yu 
Sung-u noting the two interpretations among relevant government 
officials on North Korea's acceptance of inspections: One, that 
it is part of a long-term negotiation strategy, and two, that 
there has been a sudden change in power structure within North 
Korea. Supporters of the former theory feel that North Korea's 
concession was planned to prevent the resumption of Team Spirit 
and that "it may be short-sighted to analyze that North Korea 
changed its attitude because it felt pressured by the 21 
February deadline." Those who support the latter view note that 
while the declaration to withdraw from the NPT and the 
proclamation of a semi-war state in North Korea were done in Kim 
Chong-il's name, measures to settle the situation have been done 
in Kim Il-song's name. The article speculates that Kim Il-song 
may have chosen to involve himself in the settlement process 
after judging Kim Chong-il's management of diplomatic and 
economic affairs to have failed and concludes by saying that the 
issue of succession of power remains uncertain. 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN in Korean publishes on page 
3 an 800-word editorial entitled "The Problem of Inspections on 
North Korea's Nuclear Facilities Starts Now." The editorial 
welcomes North Korea's acceptance of IAEA nuclear inspections as 
evidence that North Korea wants to avoid serious confrontation 
with international society due to the nuclear issue. The 
editorial reports, however, that "the problem is how sincerely 
North Korea will accept IAEA inspections in the future," noting 
that there have been differences of opinion between the IAEA and 
North Korea regarding procedural matters on inspections, 
including its form and scope. 
  Noting that North Korea's acceptance of IAEA nuclear 
inspections is "nothing but a beginning" and "it is no more than 
returning to the situation one year ago when North Korea 
declared its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty, NPT," the editorial stresses that "in a sense, North 
Korea's acceptance has no new, special meaning other than just 
the start of discussions on the North Korean nuclear issue." 
  The editorial urges North Korea to allow the IAEA to inspect 
all nuclear facilities, including undeclared sites in Yongbyon 
and, at the same time, stresses the need for the United States 
and the IAEA to continue negotiations with Pyongyang "with a 
consistent principle." The editorial concludes that "the 
government should realize that if it continues its policy toward 
North Korea and its nuclear policy with an irresolute and 
inconsistent attitude, the people's unrest will intensify." 
  The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN in Korean publishes on page 
3 
an 800-word editorial entitled: "North-South Dialogue Should 
Also Be Resumed." While defining North Korea's acceptance of 
nuclear inspections this time and the IAEA's announcement to 
send its inspection team to Pyongyang soon as "a dramatic 
solution," the editorial notes that North Korea failed to 
mention if the two undeclared sites in Yongbyon -- which are 
under suspicion of storing liquid and solid nuclear fuel -- will 
be inspected this time. The editorial analyzes that North 
Korea's acceptance does not mean a solution to the North Korean 
nuclear issue, but means a start to its solution, stressing that 
success of the issue depends entirely on North Korea's attitude. 
  The editorial notes that "now that North Korea has agreed to 
IAEA full-scope inspection, the only remaining problem is to 
resume a meaningful dialogue between North and South Korea to 
discuss mutual inspections between the North and the South to 
confirm denuclearization of the Korean peninsula." 
  The editorial concludes that North Korea, which has thus far 
adhered to dialogue with the United States, should correctly 
understand the need for North-South dialogue, adding that "North 
Korea should be aware that the improvement of its relations with 
the United States cannot be achieved without South Korea's 
consent." 
  The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN in Korean publishes on page 
3 an 800-word editorial entitled: "The North Korean Nuclear 
Issue Has Passed the Crisis Stage." The editorial notes that 
North Korea's decision on 16 February to accept the IAEA demand 
for nuclear inspections is a "blitzkrieg" decision and that 
"with this the North Korean nuclear issue, which was heading 
toward a crisis stage, was defused for a while." 
  Enumerating the ominous moves of the recent months in 
connection with the North Korean nuclear issue -- such as tense 
North Korean-IAEA relations, the dispatch of a U.S. national 
intelligence team to South Korea, the announcement of U.S. plans 
to deploy Patriot missiles and Apache helicopters to South 
Korea, the plan to resume the Team Spirit exercise, the 
preparations for referring the North Korean nuclear issue to the 
UN Security Council, and North Korea's reactions to these moves 
-- the editorial notes that "these were indeed shocking moves 
for those directly related to the nuclear issue and who live in 
the southern part of the peninsula." The editorial then 
appraises our government's efforts to prevent a crisis of war on 
the peninsula, indicating Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's recent 
meetings with U.S. Government officials. The editorial 
expresses the hope for a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue. 
  HANGYORE SINMUN publishes on page 2 a 900-word article by 
Kim 
Tae-ho analyzing the prospects for the North Korean nuclear 
issue in the wake of North Korea's acceptance of IAEA 
inspections. Quoting an official concerned at the National 
Unification Board, NUB, as commenting that "now the first button 
has been fastened," the article reports that the NUB official's 
comment has two implications: One is that negotiations for the 
nuclear issue as a whole will be smoother in the future and the 
other is that North Korea's acceptance is just a new start. 
  The article stresses that the resumption of North-South 
dialogue depends on whether the Team Spirit exercise is 
suspended. The article also analyzes that North Korea will 
probably demand not only the suspension of the exercise, but 
also the renouncement of the international cooperative system 
against North Korea in connection with the nuclear issue in 
return for the realization of exchanges of North-South special 
envoys. The article stresses the need not to persistently 
adhere to a solution of the nuclear issue as we see it today, 
but to first promote economic and personnel exchanges between 
the North and the South. 
<H6>  PROSPECTS </H6>
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO in Korean carries on page 4 a 
1,000-word article by Yi Sung-u on prospects for North-South 
relations following North Korea's acceptance of nuclear 
inspections. Noting that the ROK Government is busy preparing 
necessary actions for resumption of North-South contacts, the 
article reports the government is optimistic that contacts will 
be resumed and yet assumes a prudent attitude that no 
significant progress will be made soon. 
  The article notes that as North Korea employed a 
foot-dragging tactic, the government assumed a flexible attitude 
in accordance with North Korea's reactions. Recalling that 
unification-related ministers met on 25 January and confirmed 
the government position that the nuclear impasse will be broken 
only when the North fully returns to the NPT, accepts 
substantial inspections by the IAEA, and basically agrees on 
South-North mutual nuclear inspections, the article predicts 
"chances are high that the government will flexibly readjust its 
stance in accordance with how IAEA inspections and North 
Korean-U.S. contacts will proceed." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO in Korean on page 3 carries a 
1,000-word article by Washington-based correspondent Chong 
Chin-sok on prospects for North Korean-U.S. relations. The 
article reports "North Korea's acceptance of nuclear inspections 
does not mean that nuclear transparency has been guaranteed. 
However, the North Korean nuclear issue has entered a new stage 
in which chances for a crisis on the Korean peninsula have been 
diminished to some extent and the safety-valve of the nuclear 
issue has been sealed." 
  The article reports that there are numerous diplomatic, 
political, and legal obstacles that should be overcome for the 
promotion of North Korean-U.S. relations. The article predicts 
that even if high-level U.S.-North Korean dialogue is resumed, 
there is a great possibility that relatively slow progress will 
be made in the issues of suspending the Team Spirit exercise and 
promoting ties because the nuclear issue has not been cleared 
from the agenda. 
  The moderate CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 a 1,200-word 
article by Pak Tu-sik entitled "How Things Will Turn Out After 
North Korea's Acceptance of Nuclear Inspections." Noting that 
North Korea has defused the crisis over the nuclear issue by 
accepting IAEA inspections, the article predicts that North 
Korean-U.S. negotiations or North Korean-Japanese negotiations 
will start in the first half of this year if progress is made at 
the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks. 
  The article questions if inter-Korean contacts for the 
exchange of special envoys can take place smoothly. The article 
points out that the "two sides should lower the level of their 
demands." 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO in Korean carries on page 2 an 
1,200-word article by Nam Chan-chong entitled: "How the Third 
U.S.-DPRK Talks Will Evolve." 
  Noting the future obstacles of U.S.-DPRK talks, the article 
reports that "to remove these obstacles, North Korea must allow 
the IAEA inspection team to inspect thoroughly its seven 
reported nuclear facilities and the exchange of special envoys 
between the North and South must be carried out." 
  The article reports that "the ROK and the United States will 
announce the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise this weekend 
when the IAEA inspection team arrives in Pyongyang," noting an 
agreement reached between North Korea and the United States at 
their 18th working-level contact held in New York on 29 December 
1993. 
  Referring to the U.S. deployment of Patriot missiles to 
South 
Korea as a new agenda item in the negotiations between North 
Korea and the United States, the article reports: "Although the 
United States says that it will deploy Patriot missiles to South 
Korea for defensive purposes, Pyongyang will make it a issue at 
the meeting with the U.S. side." Noting the possibility of the 
U.S. cancellation of its plan to deploy the Patriots, the 
article reports that "Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu has said 
that the ROK and the United States decided to discuss it after 
21 February." 
  TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 an 1,000-word article by Pak 
Che-kyun entitled: "The Situation After North Korea's 
Acceptance of Nuclear Inspection." Referring to the ROK role in 
North Korean-U.S. talks and in North Korean-IAEA contacts, the 
article reports: "The resumption of North-South dialogue is 
getting closer as the IAEA inspection team is allowed to travel 
to North Korea this weekend." 
  Referring to the need to settle the simultaneous North-South 
inspection issue by the North and South themselves after IAEA 
special inspections are conducted, the article urges the 
government to actively strengthen cooperation with the United 
States to make North Korea aware of the importance of the 
improvement of North-South relations in order to improve 
U.S.-North Korean relations. The article continues that "some 
government officials say that the government must show its new 
negotiating card, such as the North-South economic cooperation 
card, to realize North-South dialogue." 
  TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 a 900-word article by Kim 
Cha-su entitled: "The Background and Prospects of North Korea's 
Acceptance of Nuclear Inspections." The article reports: "It 
is very successful to confirm North Korea's attitude to resolve 
the nuclear issue through dialogue," referring to the 
government's preparations to respond to North Korea's acceptance 
of nuclear inspections. Noting the background of North Korea's 
acceptance of the nuclear inspections, the article reports that 
"North Korea accepted the inspections a day before Kim 
Chong-il's birthday, and that this is intended to attract 
international recognition of the Kim Chong-il power system by 
creating an atmosphere in which North Korea gives a gift to the 
international community." 
  TONG-A ILBO carries on page 4 a 400-word article by Yi 
Chin-yong entitled: "The Prospects for IAEA Nuclear Inspection 
of North Korea." Referring to the need to inspect the two 
undeclared nuclear facilities in Yongbyon to clearly dispel the 
suspicion of North Korea's nuclear weapon development, the 
article reports that "this issue is likely to be discussed at 
the upcoming U.S.-DPRK high-level talks." Noting the background 
of North Korea's refusal to accept IAEA inspections and its 
decision to withdraw from the NPT, the article concludes that 
"it will take a long time to even confirm the result of the 
inspections. Therefore, it is too early to be optimistic over 
the North Korean nuclear issue." 
  The leftist-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN in Korean carries on 
page 
3 an 1,000-word article by Pak Chong-mun entitled: "North 
Korea, South Korea, and the United States Stopped at the Edge of 
a Precipice." Referring to Vice Foreign Minister Hong 
Sun-yong's remarks that "North Korea's acceptance of the IAEA 
nuclear inspection is only the beginning to the resolution of 
the nuclear issue," the article points out several complicated 
problems in the settlement of the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  Referring to the IAEA upcoming inspections as an opportunity 
for maintaining the continuity of nuclear safeguards and for 
guaranteeing the transparency of future nuclear inspection

  [Excerpts] Seoul, Feb. 18 (YONHAP) -- A senior South 
Korean Government official on Thursday denied various press 
reports that "something has happened" to Kim Chong-il, son and 
heir-apparent to North Korea's paramount leader Kim Il-song. 
Kim Chong-il's conspicuous absence from nationwide celebrations 
of his 52nd birthday on Wednesday has triggered wild speculation 
ranging from rumors that he had been wounded in an assassination 
attempt to reports of his being placed on good behavior by his 
father. 
  "Such speculation was probably prompted by his absence from 
celebrations of his own birthday," the official said. "But it 
has been their (North Korean) custom that Kim Chong-il doesn't 
show up for such occasions." 
  The official, who declined to be identified, noted that Kim 
Chong-il was also absent from last year's celebration of his 
birthday. 
  "As far as we know, the theory that something happened to 
Kim 
Chong-il is groundless," he added. 
  A similar line of thought was expressed in Moscow, where 
most 
Russian officials in charge of collecting external information 
reacted to the reports on Kim Chong-il with incredulity. 
  "As of this moment, we have not received any information 
that 
something has happened to Kim Chong-il," one official said. 
  "Moreover, the report that he was gravely wounded in a 
shooting appears to have no foundation whatsoever," he said. 
  The ITAR-TASS News Agency said it has contacted its 
Pyongyang 
bureau to confirm the reports but was unable to receive any 
information. "A reliable report is bound to come out if we wait 
a little longer," one official said. 
  Meanwhile in Los Angeles, Korean-Americans who have close 
contacts with North Korea also said they have not heard anything 
untoward had happened to "the dear leader," as Kim Chong-il is 
commonly called in North Korea and by pro-Pyongyang ethnic 
Koreans abroad. [passage omitted on background] 
  Separately, it was reported in Beijing Thursday that Kim 
Chong-il was placed on good behavior by his father over North 
Korea's nuclear policy. This report, which quoted an 
unidentified source in Beijing, could not be confirmed either.

Chong-il is personally taking charge of the nuclear issue and 
the affairs concerning North-South dialogue and reunification, 
thus attracting attention. On 17 February, Pyongyang radio 
[pangsong] held that Kim Chong-il is giving guidance to overall

the reunification issue, is leading the entire nation to the 
road of reunification.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 (YONHAP) -- North Korea participated 
in an Association of Southeast Asian Nations-United Nations 
workshop held in Bangkok on Thursday, KYODO News Service 
reported Friday. KYODO quoted a diplomatic source in Bangkok as 
saying that the North Korean ambassador to Thailand took part in 
the workshop as an observer, the first time that Pyongyang has 
participated in an ASEAN-related meeting. At the workshop, 19 
countries discussed cooperating with one another in the 
diplomacy of peace and prevention of disputes. 
  North Korea has contacted the Thai and other ASEAN member 
governments about joining their group, and its participation in 
the workshop may be related to the move, according to KYODO. 
  Thailand was notified last week of North Korea's desire to 
participate in the ASEAN-UN workshop, and allowed Pyongyang to 
take part as an observer after consulting with other nations, 
KYODO said. 
  The United States, Japan, Vietnam and China also attended 
the 
meeting in addition to the six ASEAN members, but South Korea 
did not take part, KYODO said. 
  Meanwhile, a South Korean Foreign Ministry official in Seoul 
said that the Thai Government had invited South Korea as an 
observer. But he said he did not understand why Thailand had 
not invited South Korea, an ASEAN dialogue partner, as a formal 
attendant.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 17 (YONHAP) -- South Korean 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said Thursday that deployment of 
Patriot missiles is yet to be decided. 
  Seoul and Washington are looking into the military need for 
deploying Patriot missiles in South Korea but have made no 
decision, Han told reporters after a series of meetings with 
U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, Undersecretary of State 
for Political Affairs Peter Tarnoff and Assistant Secretary of 
State for Political Affairs Robert Gallucci. 
  Han made a second stop in the U.S. capital on the last leg 
of 
a trip to North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) member 
countries except Mexico to coordinate joint Seoul-Washington 
measures on the North Korean nuclear problem. 
  His remark struck a different note from that of Defense 
Secretary William Perry, who said he accepted a request for the 
Patriot missiles by Gen. Gary Luck, commander of U.S. Forces in 
South Korea, and was currently discussing the timing and means 
of transport with the Seoul Government. 
  The foreign minister said he expressed opposition to 
Washington's move to reauthorize the much-feared Super 301 trade 
legislation, which requires the USTR to identify and act against 
nations that erect barriers to U.S. goods and services, in 
retaliation for a broken trade agreement with Japan. 
  Kantor said that no action has been taken, with a decision 
to 
be made after watching developments in the Washington-Tokyo 
trade framework negotiations, Han told reporters. 
  Han said Korea would likely be excluded from the priority 
watch country list on intellectual property rights violations. 
He added that he might meet President Bill Clinton on Friday 
before boarding a flight to Seoul later in the day. 
  Predicting resumption of inter-Korean dialogue in "the near 
future," Han reiterated that the third round of 
Pyongyang-Washington high-level talks would be possible only 
after full nuclear inspections and an exchange of envoys by the 
two Koreas. However, he added that under certain conditions, 
the date for the third round may be set and revealed earlier, 
hinting that Washington could announce the date in advance once 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections begin and 
inter-Korean contact resumes.

<F P=106> [Report by Yi Tong-min] </F>
  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 18 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu can return from his U.S. visit confident 
that his strategy was right, giving him more self-assurance in 
dealing with future twists and turns in the North Korean nuclear 
question. 
  Luck was on his side. He went to Washington uncertain how 
much longer he could insist on dialogue to resolve the nuclear 
issue. When he left Seoul, a nagging fear of war was spreading 
here and hard-liners were demanding action, not negotiations, 
against North Korea. 
  The nuclear issue was on the brink of being tossed to the 
U.N. Security Council, which likely would have initiated steps 
for sanctions against North Korea. 
  Then Pyongyang announced this week it would accept 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections -- after a 
one-year hiatus -- of seven sites. 
  The announcement helped turn the mood around. South Korea 
and the United States confirmed during Han's visit that they 
would continue with dialogue. 
  This stroke of luck eventually proved that the foreign 
minister's insistence on a diplomatic solution was the right 
choice. The "experience" and success gained should prove 
invaluable for the new administrations in Seoul and Washington, 
for whom the row was the first major hands-on encounter with the 
unpredictable North Korean regime. 
  With a changed mood and heightened confidence, the foreign 
minister and U.S. officials sat down to chart their future 
course. 
  They focused not only on deterring North Korea's nuclear 
development but on preventing Pyongyang's nuclear card from 
getting out of hand. 
  Seoul and Washington's conclusion was to stick to their 
principles and seek a package solution. As far as principles, 
North Korea must allow unrestricted IAEA inspections and engage 
in meaningful dialogue with South Korea on denuclearization. 
  To stop North Korea from prolonging the situation, the two 
countries agreed to resolve the nuclear problem in its entirety 
at the next North Korea-U.S. high-level talks in exchange for 
improved political and economic relations. 
  With their initial success and added credibility to trumpet, 
they must nonetheless begin anew their wrestling with North 
Korea. 
  The sour note to Han's U.S.-Canada visit was the 
overshadowing of its original purpose -- strengthening relations 
with members of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). 
  Han's visit to Mexico was canceled at the last minute, and 
his meetings with trade officials in Canada and Washington were 
played down in comparison to the nuclear negotiations. But the 
foreign minister was still able to register his country's 
concern that the regional trade agreement should not 
discriminate against non-members, asserting that South Korea 
wants to participate in NAFTA in the long run. 
  Han and Canadian Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet agreed on a 
"special partnership" to cement bilateral trade relations. In 
Washington, Han conveyed Seoul's worries that any return of the 
U.S. Super 301 trade legislation could throw cold water on their 
economic ties. But the highlight, obviously, was the 
breakthrough in the nuclear impasse.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 18 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
will make state visits to Japan from March 24-26 and to China 
from March 26-30, the presidential office Chongwadae announced 
Friday. The visits are aimed at seeking a new post-Cold War 
order in Northeast Asia and holding consultations on the North 
Korean nuclear problem. 
  This will be the second summit for Kim and Japanese Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa covering political and trade issues. 
They met last November in the southern South Korean city of 
Kyongju, with next month's summit to follow up on issues covered 
then including regional cooperation and prosperity and 
multilateral ties such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
(APEC). They are certain to address the North Korean nuclear 
dispute, exchanging views on the latest developments. 
  Kim will attend a welcome dinner hosted by Emperor Akihito 
and deliver a speech before the Japanese Diet. 
  The South Korean president heads to Shanghai on March 26 for 
a weekend stay, when he will tour sites that once housed the 
Korean government-in-exile during Japan's colonial rule of 
1910-45. He is to arrive in Beijing the following day for talks 
with Premier Li Peng on furthering bilateral relations. Kim 
will also make an address at Beijing University during his visit. 
  Kim's Predecessor No Tae-u traveled to China, but this will 
mark the first time that a South Korean leader has been received 
on a state visit. Seoul and Beijing normalized relations in 
August 1992. 
  Senior presidential aide for diplomacy and national security 
Chong Chong-ok explained that Kim will discuss achieving 
friendly and cooperative ties with the two countries that are 
close to South Korea both historically and geographically. 
  "The visits will provide opportunities to settle on a 
multilateral security dialogue forum in the region and to 
strengthen bilateral political and security cooperation," Chong 
said. 
  First Lady Son Myong-sun will accompany her husband on the 
visits.

<F P=106> [Report by Kim Myong-chol] </F>
  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 18 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam's 
visits to Japan and China in March are designed to cement 
cooperation with the two powerful neighbors, serving to promote 
peace on the Korean peninsula and enhance Seoul's status to 
better prepare for a new order in Northeast Asia. 
  Just as cooperation with the four major world powers -- the 
United States, Japan, China and Russia -- is important to 
security on the Korean peninsula, so is cooperation with Japan 
and China vital to the growth of the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) forum as a driving force for regional 
cooperation and prosperity. Kim is visiting Tokyo and Beijing to 
strengthen such cooperation. It is significant that Kim is 
meeting the leaders of these two countries when a new post-cold 
war order in Northeast Asia is in the making, especially when 
the North Korean nuclear issue is taking a turn for the better, 
Chongwadae [presidential office] spokesman Chu Ton-sik says. 
  Kim's visits will provide an opportunity for him to lay a 
regional footing upon which to promote peace on the Korean 
peninsula and build a multilateral dialogue system for regional 
security, according to other Chongwadae officials. 
  They will also help create an environment for cooperation 
among nations in the region, including Japan and China, 
conducive to a peaceful solution to the North Korean nuclear 
issue and to improved inter-Korean relations leading to eventual 
reunification. Kim will likely ask the two countries to play a 
constructive role in prodding North Korea to emerge from its 
international isolation and ride the world trend of 
globalization. 
  Chong Chong-uk, Kim's senior secretary for Foreign Affairs 
and National Security, says the visits are part of diplomatic 
efforts to secure the firm support of China and Japan in 
attaining peaceful reunification of Korea. They will provide a 
practical opportunity to build a multilateral dialogue system 
benefiting security on the Korean peninsula, including solution 
of the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  Kim is holding summits with the Japanese and Chinese leaders 
to discuss a new post-cold war order in Northeast Asia, while 
talking about nurturing APEC -- which is still in an infant 
stage -- as a regional organization. 
  On the basis of his experience at the first APEC summit in 
Seattle last November, Kim will focus on how to best develop the 
forum as a regional engine of economic cooperation in 
preparation for the second APEC summit slated for November in 
Indonesia. 
  In view of Japan and China's emergence as South Korea's 
second and third largest trade partners -- with two-way trade 
reaching 28.7 billion U.S. dollars and 9.2 billion dollars, 
respectively, last year, next only to the United States -- Kim's 
trips should lead to increased economic cooperation with the two 
countries. 
  Thus, the visits are part of his summit diplomacy aimed at 
increasing the nation's international competitiveness in an era 
of tough trade competition unleashed by the Uruguay Round accord. 
  In China, Kim will taste the fruits of such summit 
diplomacy, 
including the signing of a Korea-China aviation treaty. But he 
is against the hasty conclusion of any economic pacts just to 
enjoy ceremonial fruit. 
  In Japan, Kim will promote cultural and educational exchange 
programs. 
  Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa promised in a 
recent telephone conversation with President Kim to increase the 
number of Koreans studying in Japan under the Japanese 
Government's scholarship program for foreign students from 100 
to 200. 
  Ambassador to Japan Kong No-myong has raised the issue of 
opening the country to Japanese arts, especially to Japanese 
music and films, drawing both positive and negative opinions 
from the public. This issue is expected to attract public 
attention again when Kim visits Japan. 
  In Japan, Kim will make a speech at the Japanese Diet 
calling 
for a forward-looking relationship between the two countries. 
Whether Kim raises the issue of their unhappy historical 
relations at the Japanese emperor's dinner remains to be seen, 
as he wants Japan to settle all pending historical problems. On 
the other hand, Japan will use Kim's visit to push ahead with 
its plan to have Emperor Akihito visit Seoul. 
  In China, Kim will visit the old provisional Korean 
Government building in Shanghai, meet President Jiang Zemin and 
Prime Minister Li Peng and speak at Beijing University. The 
itinerary arranged by Beijing for President Kim is rather 
exceptional in view of China's traditional relationship with 
North Korea, Foreign Ministry officials say.

  [Text] Taegu, Feb. 18 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
on Friday reiterated the importance of environmental protection. 
"As could be seen in the recent contamination of the Naktong 
River, keeping water clean is tantamount to preserving our 
lives," Kim said. 
  During his new year inspection tour of the Taegu City Hall, 
the president said that in the preservation of environment, 
government efforts alone are not enough and all citizens should 
work as watchers against pollution. Kim suggested that Taegu 
exert all available efforts to turn the city into an advanced 
industrial center in the 21st century. "Try to develop new 
high-tech materials and produce the world's top-quality 
products," he said. 
  His tour of Taegu was followed by a similar visit to the 
North Kyongsang Province administration, where the president 
urged city officials to work hard to make their office better 
meet the needs of internationalization. 
  "There should be sweeping reforms in local administrations. 
You should work harder in concert with farmers to ensure rural 
development," he said. 
  Later in the day, President Kim called at the North 
Kyongsang 
Province apple juice plant at Uihong-myon, Kunui County.

  [Text] Hong Kong, Feb. 18 (YONHAP) -- The Taiwanese 
Government has decided to impose high temporary anti-dumping 
tariffs on Korean- and Japanese-produced polypropylene. 
  The newspaper LIENHEPAO here reported in a dispatch from 
Taipei Friday that Taiwan Finance Ministry's tariff rates 
committee on Thursday decided on the tariffs ranging from 110.67 
to 6.57 percent on the ground that the polypropylene exported by 
South Korea and Japan has had a serious effect on the Taiwanese 
industry. This is the second Taiwanese anti-dumping tariffs on 
Korean products since diplomatic ties broke up between the two 
countries in August 1992. Last year, Taipei slapped 
anti-dumping tariffs on polyethylene cases exported by South 
Korea. 
  The report said that the anti-dumping tariffs will be 
imposed 
on Korean and Japanese polypropylene as decided by the committee 
as soon as the decision is approved by the administration, a 
rather perfunctory procedure. About 20 South Korean and 
Japanese industries are subject to the assessment of the 
tariffs, the paper added.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 18 (YONHAP) -- The opposition Democratic 
Party [DP] will vote against the Uruguay Round agreement on a 
new world trade order when it is referred to the National 
Assembly for ratification because it would make the country's 
farmland desolate, party chairman Yi Ki-taek said in a policy 
speech delivered at a legislative plenary session on Friday. 
  The party cannot approve the market opening schedules the 
government has submitted to the secretariat of the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade because they were prepared 
without consultation with the DP, he told parliament. 
  Yi then called for scrapping the National Security Law, 
which 
he called "a leftover of the Cold War era," and enacting a new 
law protecting democratic order to replace it. 
  Commenting on political reforms, he echoed ruling Democratic 
Liberal Party chairman Kim Chong-pil's call for passage of the 
reform bills by parliament during its current session. 
  The redistricting plan being studied by the ruling party 
should be limited to merging counties into their adjacent 
cities, and the central government should delegate many of its 
powers to local governments for effective local autonomy. 
  The ruling party should not make use of the redistricting 
plan to achieve its political objectives, he warned. 
  Yi also called for an immediate summit meeting between North 
and South Korea, adding, "I believe that even if a summit is out 
of question now I, in the capacity of the opposition leader, 
must meet the North Korean leaders to solve inter-Korean issues." 
  He welcomed North Korea's belated decision to allow 
international inspections of its nuclear facilities and said, 
"there still remain problems and the government should make 
diplomatic efforts to solve the nuclear issue in three-way 
negotiations among Washington, Pyongyang and Seoul." 
  Calling for revision of the denuclearization declaration on 
the Korean peninsula, which bars North and South Korea from 
possessing nuclear fuel-reprocessing facilities after the 
settlement of the nuclear issue, Yi said the annual military 
exercise with the United States, "Team Spirit," must be 
suspended as it stands in the way of a peaceful solution to the 
nuclear issue. 
  The government should give top priority in its economic 
management plan to fighting rising costs as the people now 
suffer from runaway inflation, he stressed. He called for the 
central bank to be independent from the government, tax reforms, 
amendments to labor laws, a law replacing the emergency 
presidential order requiring the use of real names in all 
financial transactions, and measures against water pollution. 
  The opposition leader urged President Kim Yong-sam to 
present 
a clear direction for his reform program and to carry it out 
lawfully, calling the reforms of the past year "a reform for 
show and demonstration."

  [Text] The Philippines welcomes North Korea's decision to 
finally agree to open its nuclear facilities to international 
inspection after a year long standoff. Foreign Affairs 
Secretary Roberto Romulo said that North Korea's decision will 
considerably diffuse tension in the Korean peninsula and ease 
the concerns of the countries in the region. Romulo said North 
Korea's move may have nipped U.S.-led efforts to push for 
sanctions against the communist state; this is, if it continues 
to refuse inspections of its nuclear facilities by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency.

  [Text] Cebu City -- The New People's Army (NPA) has 
threatened to bomb vital government and public utility 
installations in the Visayas if government decides to reimpose 
the 28 January oil price increases it temporarily rolled back on 
7 February. A message from the PNP [Philippine National Police] 
headquarters in Camp Crame to the regional PNP command said the 
rebels plan to bomb the installations in Cebu, Bacolod, 
Dumaguete and lloilo. 
  The message said that among the installations targeted in 
Cebu are oil depots, power plants of the National Power Corp., 
the regional offices of the Central Bank, the Mactan Cebu 
International Airport and military facilities. The message said 
the plan was hatched by Filemon Lagman, Communist Party of the 
Philippines (CPP) secretary-general, at a conference of the 
CPP's Visayas Commission last 1 February. 
  It was not clear why the rebels aired the threat at a 
supposed meeting on 1 February when the roll back had yet to 
come until a week later. 
  Cebu Metrodiscom [metro district command] director Senior 
Superintendent Jose Ayap said he has already placed all police 
units under him under alert.

  [Text] The National Economic and Development Authority 
(NEDA) yesterday approved P16.5 billion [Philippine pesos] worth 
of new power projects even as it gave assurance that brownouts 
will no longer not happen this year. [sentence as published] 
These projects, the NEDA said in a statement, are intended to 
stabilize the long term energy supply of the country. Among 
those approved are the Northern Negros and Mount Labo Geothermal 
Power Projects whose combined costs total P10 billion. 
  Socioeconomic Planning Secretary and NEDA director-general 
Cielito F. Habito said these projects involve the development of 
geothermal steam fields and the construction of baseload power 
plants in Mambucal, Northern Negros, and in Mount Labo, 
Camarines Sur. The baseload power plant in Mambucal will have a 
capacity of 40 megawatts (MW) while the one in Mount Labo will 
generate 120 MW of power. Habito said these projects will 
augment the power supply in the Luzon and Visayas grids. 
  The second power project approved is the Northwestern Luzon 
Extra High Voltage Transmission Line Project which will cost 
around P5 billion. It involves the installation of 500-kilovolt 
(KV) transmission lines from Labrador to San Manuel, and from 
San Manuel to San Jose. The line from Labrador to San Manuel 
will be 60 kilometers long while the one from San Manuel to San 
Jose will be 145 kilometers long. 
  The third project is the Masinloc-Labrador Transmission Line 
Project. It involves the installation of a 65 kilometer (km), 
230 kilovolt (kv) steel tower double circuit line from the 600 
MW Masinloc Coal Fired Power Plant to Labrador, Pangasinan. It 
will also expand the Labrador substation. Total cost of this 
project is estimated at P697 million. 
  The fourth project is the Cluster A Substation Expansion 
Project which involves the provision of additional power 
facilities and accessories in the following substations: Laoag; 
Dasmarinas; and San Manuel. It will cost P365 million. Habito 
said the project is expected to accommodate future increases in 
power demand, provide adequate reactive power support to avoid 
system collapse, and improve voltage regulation. 
  A similar project is the Cluster B Substation Expansion 
Project which the NEDA board also approved. The substations to 
be expanded are the following: La Trinidad Substation; 
Concepcion Substation; Dasmarinas Substation; and San Manuel 
Substation. With an estimated cost of P345 million, the project 
aims to complement generating capacity additions programmed for 
the Luzon grid. 
  The last project approved was the Permanent Bypass Damper 
and 
Stack System Project for the Bataan Combined-Cycle Power Plants. 
It will cost P395 million and will be implemented within eight 
months. 
  The other projects are the Environmental Equipment for 
National Power Corporation (Napocor) Power Plants Project and 
the conduct of Detailed Engineering for the Kanan Hydroelectric 
power plant. The two will have a combined cost of P274 million. 
Detailed engineering for the Kanan Hydroelectric Power Plant 
will involve the review and updating of the feasibility study of 
the Kanan B1 Hydroelectric Power. It will also carry out the 
detailed design of structures and facilitate technology transfer 
for Napocor engineers. This project will cost P145 million.

  [Text] The country's balance of trade deficit widened to 
$6.36 billion last year, up by 35 percent from the previous year 
due to the faster growth in imports. Total imports reached 
$17.63 billion, up by 21 percent, while exports rose by only 15 
percent at $11.269 billion. 
  The Philippine Airline's purchase of two airplanes ($281 
million) helped increase by 26 percent the country's import bill 
of $1.66 billion for last December. 
  Total export receipts for the month of December stood at $1 
billion. 
  Electronic imports reached $220.15 million, up by 1.3 
percent 
from the previous month. 
  Despite a decrease of 6 percent from the previous month's 
level of $181.40 million, import expenditures on power 
generators for December remained substantial at $170.45 million 
due to the continuing development of energy infrastructure. 
  Payments for mineral fuels, lubricants and related materials 
amounting to $154.20 million grew by only 2.6 percent from the 
November figures of $150.34 million. Compared to the year-ago 
level, however, a decline of 28 percent was posted. 
  Importation of telecommunication equipment and electrical 
machines was valued at $97.76 million. Import payments on these 
commodities, however, represented a decrease of 9.5 percent from 
the $108.03 million recorded during the previous month. 
Aggregate payments for these principal imports reached $923.49 
million, or 55.5 percent of the country's total imports for the 
month. 
  United States and Japan continued to be the biggest 
suppliers 
of Philippine imports. Imports from these two countries reached 
$448.45 and $353.27 million respectively, accounting for a 
combined 48.2 percent of the total Philippine imports for the 
month.

  [Text] Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam is now 
on an official visit to the Kingdom of Cambodia. This is the 
first official visit to Cambodia since the setting up of the 
constitutional monarchy government in that country in September 
last year. 
  Vietnam always attaches great importance to friendship and 
good neighborliness with Cambodia. Immediately upon setting up 
the new government, Cambodia affirmed its continued 
strengthening of relations with Vietnam. In such a situation, 
this visit by Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam is an important 
contribution to consolidating and strengthening mutual 
relations. The results of the talks between Vietnamese Foreign 
Minister Nguyen Manh Cam and his Cambodian counterpart signal 
good news in bilateral relations. They both discussed 
preparations for the coming official visit to the Kingdom of 
Cambodia by Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. Cambodian 
Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister Prince Sirivut remarked: 
These events will open up a new stage in relations between 
Vietnam and Cambodia. 
  Cambodia remains faced with many difficulties due to the 
lack 
of goodwill of the Khmer Rouge, but developments in Cambodia 
tend to be positive. This is due to the important and great 
role played by King Norodom Sihanouk in the process of peace and 
national reconciliation in Cambodia. 
  In the implementation of its open-door and diversified 
foreign policy, Vietnam is determined to establish and broaden 
multifaceted relations with Cambodia. This Cambodia visit by 
the Vietnamese foreign minister and the coming visit by the 
Vietnamese head of government will be a vivid expression of 
Vietnam's stance.

"Japan-U.S. Summit Meeting -- Stop the Trade War; There Are Many 
Other Important Things To Do; Speed Up Restoration of 
Cooperative Relations"] 
  [Text] Japan-U.S. Framework Talks Making No 
Progress 
  About two weeks ago I was listening at a hotel in Washington 
to a State of the Union address by President Bill Clinton. It 
was a strong plea for the revival of the United States by 
reforming the medical care system and by fighting crime. 
  What was interesting about it was there was no mention of 
either foreign economic issues or of a reference to Japan. One 
of the officials I met the following day told me that although 
the Office of U.S. Trade Representative and the Department of 
Commerce wanted the issue of the trade imbalance with Japan 
included in the speech, the White House wanted to focus on 
domestic issues. 
  This weekend, Hosokawa and Clinton will meet in the White 
House. In the days of U.S.-Soviet confrontation, Japanese-U.S. 
summit meetings had a successful outcome every time one was 
called. That was because the most important theme was 
confirmation of the Japanese-U.S. alliance, and because Japan 
was able to decide on defense policies or on the burdens 
necessary to implement such policies through agreement by only a 
handful of powerful men in the government and ruling party. 
With the Cold War structure gone, however, things do not work 
that way. It is still fresh in our memory that the 
Miyazawa-Bush conference in Tokyo in January 1992 was seen as a 
failure because it did not resolve economic problems. 
  The key topic at the forthcoming summit meeting is progress 
in the Japan-U.S. economic consultations. But the two sides are 
making heavy weather of the consultations, and it is by no means 
clear the summit meeting will be successful. For both Japan and 
the United States, it would be good political news to announce 
the "summit meeting was a success." But the present differences 
will make it difficult for the United States to even issue the 
usual announcement that "measures presented by Japan in the 
economic consultations are a first step in the right direction, 
and we welcome it." 
  Why are the consultations facing such heavy going this time? 
  First, the talks are not needed, economically speaking. The 
Japan-U.S. structural impediments initiative (SII) talks 
concluded in 1990 were aimed at agreeing on the macroeconomic 
measures necessary for both Japan and the United States to 
redress their respective problems of underconsumption and 
undersaving. This was following an agreement that "the 
difference in the volume of savings used for investment is the 
cause of the bilateral imbalance." Agreements made at those SII 
talks are in the process of being implemented step by step. 
  What Japan and the United States should be doing now, first 
of all, are further adjustments of macroeconomic measures within 
the framework of the talks (drastic Japanese deregulation in the 
interests of consumers, for instance). 
  But it was impossible for the Clinton camp, which criticized 
President Bush's trade policy during the presidential election 
campaign, to simply take over and continue the SII talks. They 
had to create new framework talks no matter how absurd the logic 
for them. The upshot is the comprehensive framework talks 
intended to put numerical targets, called "objective criteria," 
on industrial sectors about which the United States has been 
unhappy. The U.S. demands smell strongly of managed trade, 
while many of them are excessive in view of the existing market 
mechanism. 
  A second reason why the consultations are facing a tough 
time 
is that Japan, under the heavy pressure of economic recession, 
has become unable to find a way to accept the U.S. demands. 
Take automobiles, for instance. With the domestic production 
shrinking, there is no way the country can increase imports of 
auto parts from the United States no matter how hard the latter 
may push. 
  A third reason is the difficult schedule according to which 
negotiations on three priority areas -- government procurement, 
insurance and automobiles -- must reach agreement in six months. 
Changing Negotiation Politics 
  The SII talks started in July 1989. Six months later, in 
February 1990, Japanese and U.S. bureaucrats were still 
confronting each other. To find a breakthrough, Prime Minister 
Toshiki Kaifu and President George Bush met at Palm Springs at 
the end of February. Based on agreements at the meeting, 
negotiations resumed in March, and, after repeated pushing and 
pulling in the tough talks, they finally arrived at a conclusion 
in June. 
  Although the 1993 framework talks started in July, the same 
month the SII talks started, they were supposed to have been 
completed by February -- at the same stage the SII talks were 
only at the halfway point on the major points. To make matters 
worse, the Hosokawa government had, until recently, been very 
much occupied with debates on the issue of political reform. 
There is no denying that the talks have been too short. 
  then there is a fourth reason, which is even more 
troublesome. This is the matter of Japan-U.S. negotiation 
politics. Previously in this column I once wrote about the 
Clinton government's mistake of turning Japan-U.S. relations 
from a multilayered relationship involving politics, security, 
the economy, and global cooperation into a single-layered 
relationship involving only the economy. Under Republican 
leaders, those in charge of Japan-U.S. economic negotiations 
were Secretary of State Shultz and Secretary of State Baker. 
But in recent negotiations one cannot find the name of 
Secretary of State Christopher anywhere. The people taking part 
in the negotiations are only sectoral battle commanders like 
U.S. Trade Representative Kantor and Secretary of Commerce Brown. 
  Even during the SII talks there were sharp differences 
between Japan and the United States on individual issues. The 
reason the talks came to a conclusion despite them is that Japan 
promised to make public works investments of 430 trillion yen 
over a 10-year period and Secretary of State Baker, who was 
looking for a good time to conclude the talks, decided to accept 
the offer and ordered all troops to "stop shooting," even though 
not everyone on the U.S. side was satisfied with the deal. 
  In the current talks it is President Clinton himself who 
will 
assess the 15 trillion-yen economic stimulus package, which is 
the result of so much trouble and so many tribulations. The 
summit meeting apparently stands on a very thin layer of ice. 
  On the other hand, Japan has its problems. Prime Minister 
Hosokawa alone is responsible for making political decisions and 
implementing them. When Japan decided on a package of 430 
trillion yen at the time of the SII talks -- despite the strong 
resistance of the Finance Ministry -- it was possible to do so 
because there was support from powerful politicians. In the 
current talks, Hosokawa has no such supporters, and this means 
the bureaucrats can lead the talks. After all, if a country 
wants to prevent an economic issue from turning into a political 
issue in negotiations, it needs cooperation of both parties. 
  As far as the United States is concerned, talks with Japan 
are nothing more than political talks in which Congress, the 
industry, and the administration cooperate as a single force. 
If Japan tried to find a solution within its administration 
only, the talks would not work out well. That is because for 
Japan, which still makes something like $50 billion from the 
United States, it is a political decision on what, if anything, 
it can give back in return. 
  In discussing the politics of negotiation, there is an 
element which, though small, must not be overlooked. This is 
the attitude of the Japanese bureaucrats, who have long 
participated in negotiations with the United States and are 
increasingly displeased by the tough negotiation methods they 
encounter. Their attitude may represent a diminishing of 
respect by the Japanese toward the United States that is a 
result of a new generation of Japanese negotiators taking charge. 
  The framework talks are now at a critical phase. If they are 
not successfully concluded, the United States will take 
unilateral action against Japan, resorting to presidential 
decrees and other means. Throughout the first half of this year 
Japan-U.S. relations will likely remain strained. In Congress 
there is a feeling of resentment that the U.S. Government, which 
devoted so much time to NAFTA and the GATT's Uruguay Round of 
talks, made the mistake of letting Japan and China do as they 
pleased in bilateral trade. 
  But when seen in the long term, the current framework 
talks will probably be the last trade war between Japan and the 
United States. Japanese trade, which hit a peak last year, is 
thought to have decreased gradually since. According to last 
year's economic white paper, the income elasticity of import 
volumes for Japan from 1985 to 1992 was 1.48, which is three 
times as much as the income elasticity of exports. This means 
structurally it has become easier for Japan's economy to 
increase imports and to decrease exports. 
<H5>  Market Logic Should Solve the Problem </H5>
  While it is never desirable, a further drop in export 
elasticity or the export share of world trade is fully possible. 
The situation is more serious if we think about the problem of 
the excess capacity of Japanese industry, the pressure on 
industry to curb its tendency toward excessive competition, and 
the industrial hollowing out as a result of the 
high-yen-prompted removal of production facilities. 
  Rapid industrialization of Asian nations is now causing 
deindustrialization and deflation in Japan. There is now a 
growing view that Japan has no choice but to increase its 
nonmanufacturing service sectors. 
  All this -- as far as relations with the United States are 
concerned -- means things are flowing toward a redress of the 
imbalance. Bluntly put, this means the trade imbalance between 
Japan and the United States, which has lasted for more than a 
decade, is likely to be resolved through the logic of the 
market, not of the government. It will mean a reduction in 
exports of Japanese products to the United States in relative 
terms and not, as is wanted by the United States, an increase in 
its exports to Japan. 
  Japan and the United States have so many issues to discuss. 
These include role-sharing in the post-Cold War world, making 
contributions to stabilization in Asia, the DPRK nuclear issue, 
and the sort of economic and social structures the two countries 
should seek to encourage. Prime Minister Hosokawa and President 
Clinton need to speedily form a Japan-U.S. relationship 
befitting the new era. The chances are getting slimmer that 
Ambassador Mondale's hope for an early finish to the framework 
talks and candid discussions on other important matters will be 
realized. We do hope, however, the two leaders reach agreement.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Feb 18 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Russia should 
tell the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw all their heavy weaponry from 
the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina and not just Sarajevo, Malaysian 
Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said today. 
  Sarajevo is [word indistinct] everything; the whole of 
Bosnia 
should be liberated from the Serb (forces) and they should 
withdraw all their weapons, said the prime minister. 
  This was to allow the Bosnians to participate in 
negotiations 
without being threatened, he added. 
  He was responding to reporters' questions about a possible 
Serbo compliance with an ultimatum by the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organisation (NATO) fo the withdrawal of heavy guns around 
Sarajevo to help bring about a comprehensive solution to the 
Balkan conflict. 
  Russia was reported to have asked the Bosnian Serbs to 
comply 
with the NATO ultimatum. 
  Dr. Mahathir was also asked about the likely impact of 
imminent U.S. trade sanctions against Japan following the 
failure by both countries to reach a trade agreement. 
  He said the government was studying it first, at the moment, 
it was not sure what the effects would be. 
  But, he said: we agree that while we should open th market 
for everybody there should not be any numerical quota of imports 
by anybody... You buy what you think is fair and what you need, 
not on the basis of quota. 
  As to the possible effects of the U.S.-Japan trade impasse 
on 
the recently concluded Uruguay Round of multilateral trade 
negotiations and the General Agreemant on Tariffs and Trade, Dr. 
Mahathir said the US had withdrawn certain items from what they 
had agreed to in the Uruguay Round. 
  This is not a good omen... What is to stop other people from 
withdrawing items, then there would be no Uruguay Round, no GATT 
agreement, he added.

  [Text] Phnom Penh, Feb 18 (AFP) -- Government forces have 
captured another strategic Khmer Rouge base in northern 
Cambodia, government and military officials said Friday. 
  Co-Defence Minister Tea Chamrat said government troops 
captured the Khmer Rouge base at Anse, which straddles the Thai 
border in remote Preah Vihear province, Thursday. There were no 
immediate casualty figures. 
  Its capture comes after the government said it had full 
control over the radical faction's base at Anlong Veng some 80 
kilometers (50 miles) to the west which it seized earlier this 
month. 
  Anlong Veng was the Khmer Rouge's headquarters for guerrilla 
operations in north and central Cambodia. 
  Tea Chamrat said the Khmer Rouge had now pulled back east to 
Krapeang Kul, an isolated area where the Cambodian, Lao and Thai 
borders meet. 
  The Khmer Rouge had been bringing rocket launchers and 
artillery pieces forward from Anse to pound government positions 
in Choam Khsan, some 25 kilometers (15 miles) south of the 
border. 
  Government officers said the Khmer Rouge were attacking 
Choam 
Khsan as a diversionary tactic to draw Cambodia's troops away 
from Anlong Veng. 
  Western aid officials said that some 3,000 villagers had 
fled 
to the Preah Vihear provincial capital, Tbeng Meanchey, to 
escape guerrilla artillery and rocket attacks. 
  But provincial Governor Mean Sarin said the villagers should 
now be able to return home. 
  "I am very optimistic that after capturing Anse all the 
displaced villagers can come back from Theng Meanchey to Choam 
Khsan and they will have no more fears," he said. 
  The guerrillas captured Anse last August in an attack which 
United Nations peacekeepers said was partially launched from 
Thai territory. UN personnel, stationed at the border at the 
time, were detained by guerrillas during the attack but were 
later released unharmed. 
  Mean Sarin said that government troops would now try to 
recapture the nearby historic hill-top temples of Preah Vihear. 
  The guerrillas seized the temples in a pre-dawn raid July 7 
which government and military officials said was also launched 
from Thai territory. 
  "We have the ability and the means to capture the very 
famous 
temple back from the Khmer Rouge," he said. 
  Tea Chamrat said he did not know if the recent government 
victories would force the guerrilla faction to the negotiating 
table. 
  "We cannot guess whether they will come and talk. But if 
they 
don't want to talk, we can only stop them from disturbing us," 
he said.

  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday hit back 
at China for having rapped Bangkok over a private visit by 
Taiwanese President Li Teng-hui, saying the president was not a 
persona non grata and had every right to enter Thailand. 
"Everybody who is not persona non grata has the right to enter 
Thailand, just as the Dalai Lama has done," Chuan said his 
strongest statement yet on the Taiwanese president's visit. 
[passage omitted] 
  The prime minister said there was no agreement between 
Thailand and China to bar an unofficial visit by a Taiwanese 
president. 
  Chuan said that although Thailand holds a one-China policy 
and has no diplomatic ties with Taiwan, Bangkok has the right to 
negotiate with the island state over trade, economic and labour 
issues. "As I have said, Thailand has a one-China policy. But 
if any people like to travel to Thailand on the invitation of 
the private sector, he or she can do so. Thailand and Taiwan 
have trade ties, and Taiwanese businessmen are the third largest 
investors here, second to Japan and the United States. We give 
priority to economic ties with both Taiwan and China. Taiwan has 
more investment in Thailand than China does," Chuan said. 
  The prime minister said Li did not come to Thailand to 
discuss diplomatic or political ties, and had not met him or 
Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri. [passage omitted] Chuan said 
leaders of the two other Asean countries had provided reception 
to Li, but the Thai prime minister had not. "So, (China) should 
understand how we treat the China policy," Chuan said. 
  Prasong said yesterday that Li's unofficial trip to Thailand 
was just a "private" visit and the Chinese Ambassador in Bangkok 
would be invited for talks to clear up any misunderstanding. 
"The president's visit was very much a personal affair. The 
Thai government still holds a one-China policy," Prasong 
insisted. If China still did not understand the point, he was 
ready to explain it personally to the Chinese Ambassador. 
Prasong reiterated that Thailand did not intend to change its 
China policy. 
  He denied that the meeting between Deputy Prime minister and 
Li Teng-hui was official, adding that the two did not discuss 
politics or economics. "Amnuai went to see President Li in a 
personal capacity, not as deputy prime minister," Prasong said. 
[passage omitted] 
  Asked whether the visit would jeopardize progress in the 
Economic Quadrangle -- a multi-lateral development between 
China, Thailand, Laos, and Burma -- as charged by the opposition 
Prasong said the two subjects could not be linked. "It means the 
opposition doesn't know any thing about the Economic 
Quadrangle," he said, without elaborating. [passage omitted] 
  The House Speaker, Marut Bunnak denied he had discussed 
politics during a luncheon he hosted for the president at the 
Central Plaza Hotel on Wednesday. "I have been in Taiwan and was 
warmly welcomed. So I just wanted to show my hospitality in 
return. This is just Thai tradition," Marut said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 KYODO -- Japan will seek support on 
its economic efforts and call for reaffirming an accord on 
stable currency rates at a Group of Seven (G-7) industrial 
nations' meeting in Germany February 26, Finance Minister 
Hirohisa Fujii said Friday [18 February]. 
  "I will explain the direction of tax reforms" at the G-7 
meeting of finance ministers and central bankers, Fujii told 
reporters after a morning cabinet meeting. He was referring to 
reported U.S. dissatisfaction over Japan's income tax cuts 
limited to a single year. 
  Fujii noted that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa instructed 
his ministers at the cabinet meeting to pin down efforts in 
realizing tax reform by the end of the year, as agreed to by the 
ruling coalition parties. "That (agreement) spells out a 
balanced tax system on income and consumption," Fujii stressed, 
indicating a direction for full-fledged income tax cuts. 
  He also said he would "strongly insist" that Japan's record 
15.25 trillion yen stimulus package, including 6 trillion yen in 
tax cuts, would contribute to lifting the economy. 
  On currency exchange rates, Fujii expressed his intention to 
call for reaffirmation of a past G-7 accord that calls for 
cooperation to stem speculative moves and keep rates stable 
under economic fundamentals. "Wild volatility is bad not only 
for a country but for the global economy," Fujii noted. 
  Fujii brushed aside speculation that U.S. monetary 
authorities intend to tolerate the yen's rise, saying, "I don't 
know about other U.S. officials but I haven't heard any such 
remarks by the monetary authorities." 
  Regarding the Japan-U.S. "Framework" trade talks, the U.S. 
side "seems to be misunderstanding" the insurance area, Fujii 
said, noting that Japan must make further explanation. Japan 
will continue to take deregulatory and other measures in the 
insurance field, and they will be specified in a detailed 
program to be launched at the G-7 meeting. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura on Thursday told 
reporters that Hosokawa will hold a cabinet meeting to discuss 
Japan's measures in reducing the trade imbalance. 
  On possible U.S. sanctions against Japan, Fujii said 
although 
Hosokawa and Clinton failed to reach agreement on the framework 
talks during their February 11 meeting, they did agree to 
maintain "basic friendship relations." 
  "This must not be destroyed," he said.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA Feb. 16 -- Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh 
Cam arrived in Phnom Penh this morning, starting his 3-day 
official visit to Cambodia. Shortly after his arrival, Mr 
Nguyen Manh Cam held talks with Prince Norodom Sirivut, deputy 
prime minister and minister for foreign affairs and 
international cooperation of the Kingdom of Cambodia. 
  Present at the talks were, on the Vietnamese side, 
Ambassador 
to Cambodia Tran Huy Chuong and other senior officials of the 
Foreign Ministry on the Cambodia side, senior officials of the 
Ministry for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, 
Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Interior and others. Mr. N. 
Sirivut hailed the Vietnamese foreign minister's visit to 
Cambodia as an important contribution to the consolidation and 
development of the traditional friendship and neighbourly 
cooperation beween Vietnam and Cambodia. The two sides informed 
each other of the situation in each country, discussed 
orientations and measures aimed at consolidating and promoting 
the multi-faceted cooperation, building the neighbourly and 
durable ties between the two countries in the interest of each 
people, for peace, stability, cooperation and development in 
Southeast Asia. Both sides discussed preparations for 
Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's forthcoming official 
visit to Cambodia. They also touched on the regional and 
international issues of common concern. Minister Nguyen Manh 
Cam highly appreciated head of state Norodom Sihanouk's 
important role in the cause of peace and national reconciliation 
in Cambodia and expressed his hope that Cambodia will have 
stability to build a country of peace, independence, neutrality 
and non-alignment having friendly relations with other 
countries, firstly neighbouring countries. He once again 
affirmed Vietnam's determination to build and broaden the 
friendly and multi-faceted cooperation between the two countries 
on the principles stated in the joint communiques in January 
1992 and in August 1993. 
  Mr. Sirivut hailed the great achievements recorded by the 
Vietnamese people in their renovation cause and in the 
implementation of the external policy of broadening and 
diversifying relations and highly appreciated Vietnam's good 
will and positive attitude toward the process of peace in 
Cambodia. He also expressed the determination of the Cambodian 
Government and people to foster the friendship and long-term 
cooperation between the two countries. He stated that the coming 
visit to the Kingdom of Cambodia by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
will be an important event ushering in a new stage in the 
neighbourly relations between Vietnam and Cambodia. The talks 
took place in an atmosphere of friendship, sincerity, mutual 
understanding and reached positive results.

  [Text] The foreign affairs minister, Gareth Evans, says 
Australia won't be sending troops to back up United Nations 
peacekeeping forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Senator Evans says 
there is no shortage of available troops, and the decision has 
been taken out of respect for Australians with ties to the 
former Republic of Yugoslavia. 
  In a television interview, he said that once a country 
provided troops it was hard to appear impartial. Sen. Evans 
said the Bosnian conflict had a strong emotional impact on 
important sections of the Australian community--including 
Croats, Serbs, and Bosnian Muslims. He said they were 
represented in Australia in large numbers and, in such a 
situation--if troops were committed--it would be hard to avoid 
being seen to take sides.

  [Text] Australia says there is an element of brinksmanship 
in China's attacks on political reform in Hong Kong. 
Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, said China would be 
most unwise to undo electoral changes when it takes over the 
colony in 1997. Senator Evans was responding to an Australian 
Television interview to China's criticism of him as 
irresponsible over the Hong Kong issue. 
  The comment carried by the XINHUA News Agency followed 
Senator Evans' expression of admiration on Wednesday for the 
democratic reforms being promoted by Britain through its Hong 
Kong Governor Chris Patten. Senator Evans said his statement of 
support during Mr. Patten's official visit to Canberra was not 
the first time Australia had backed the electoral changes. 
Australia's foreign minister said Britain was taking a few 
modest steps on the path of democratization. Senator Evans said 
it was consistent with the terms of the agreement between China 
and Britain. He said Australia and rest of the world should 
stand firm on the democratic principle involved in Hong Kong. 
Senator Evans is scheduled to visit China in early April.

  [Text] The Australian Government says it has seen no 
evidence to support allegations of a second massacre by 
Indonesian forces in the East Timor capital, Dili, in November 
1991. The foreign minister, Gareth Evans, said there was no 
evidence to justify anything like the claim made by the 
Australian journalist, John Pilger. 
  Mr. Pilger's television documentary on East Timor, which is 
to be screened in Europe this week, claims that in addition to 
as many as 90 or more people killed by Indonesian security 
forces at Dili's Santa Cruz Cemetery those captured at the scene 
and wounded people taken to hospital were themselves 
subsequently murdered. 
  Speaking on Australian commercial television, Senator Evans 
said there was no evidence to support such an allegation. The 
Australian foreign minister said he placed less value on the 
report because of Mr. Pilger's record of distorted 
sensationalism mixed with sentiment. Senator Evans said there 
were still uncertainties about what happened and how many people 
were missing and dead as a result of the Dili incident. But he 
said there were a number of eye- witnesses at the hospital and 
cemetery who denied Mr. Pilger's claims of a second massacre.

  [Excerpt] New Zealand's prime minister, Jim Bolger, has 
welcomed news that the United States has decided to upgrade its 
contacts with New Zealand after seven years of restriction 
because of New Zealand's antinuclear policy. The announcement 
was made in a message from the American secretary of state, 
Warren Christopher, to New Zealand's foreign minister, Don 
McKinnon. Mr. Bolger said the upgrading applied to both 
governmental and military contacts. However, REUTERS news agency 
says the message emphasized that while the American Government 
had decided to resume senior-level contacts, this did not 
signify a restoration of United States' defense obligations to 
New Zealand. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The U.S. ambassador to Phnom Penh, Mr. Twining, 
hastily provided the two-headed government with medical aid on 
18 February. The bulk of this was surgical equipment and 
medicine. This was emergency assistance to the two-headed 
government's raiding forces, who have been engaged in major 
military operations especially at Anlung Veng and have suffered 
heavy casualties. Their many wounded are being treated at all 
the hospitals. The United States must stop interfering in 
Cambodia and desist from continuing to kindle the communist 
Vietnamese war of aggression in Cambodia. 
  Which is more beneficial: kindling the flames of war or 
letting Cambodians achieve national conciliation? The Cambodian 
people need national conciliation. They are resolutely opposed 
to all forms of aggressive war, wherever they may come from.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA in Cambodian 
publishes in its 19 February issue an approximately 1,000-word 
report on actions by government forces against trespassers in 
the O Bek K'am area in suburban Phnom Penh. 
  The report says that an appeal was made by Prince Krompreah 
Norodom Ranariddh, first prime minister, to armed persons who 
illegally occupied land in the O Bek K'am area. One day after 
the appeal was made, these persons still refuse to leave the 
expropriated land. "To resolve the issue peacefully, the 
government used airplanes to drop leaflets containing the appeal 
of the prince on the disputed area, which is reported to be 
about 200 hectares. 
  "Faced with the stubborness of these armed violators, on the 
afternoon of 17 February at around 1430, combined forces 
comprising troops from the special military region, the military 
police, and the Interior Ministry security police, accompanied 
by six tanks and armored vehicles, entered the area. The troops 
fired the first salvo against targets believed to be the 
positions of the ringleaders of the illegally armed persons." 
  "It is to be recalled that 80 percent of these land 
violators 
are armed and the other 20 percent rely on them." 
  "According to reliable reports, the ringleaders are a former 
FUNCINPEC (National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, 
Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia) general, a field grade 
officer; a former lieutenant general and a major general of the 
Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party. Ten percent of this group is 
demobilized soldiers; some are former Cambodian People's Party 
troops." 
  "According to preliminary reports, the combined forces are 
in 
complete control of the area. They have arrested more than 20 
trespassers and are burning houses built by them. According to 
reports from some people living near the area, by 1800 on 17 
February four persons were killed in the assault." 
  In its 20 February issue, REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA continues its 
report on the operations against the trespassers, saying that 
"about 1430, [on 18 February] the armed group, which according 
to reliable sources comprises about 100 armed persons, was still 
in the area and had fired two B-40 rockets at the special 
military region forces stationed nearby." According to the same 
sources, the special military region command and the Phnom Penh 
police received authorization following this incident to act to 
stop the violence. 
  "His Excellency [H.E.] General Tea Chamrat, co-defense 
minister, and co-Minister H.E. Yu Hokkri, accompanied by H.E. 
co-State Secretary Khan Savoeun, went to the scene. They issued 
orders to the forces in cooperation with the armored vehicles 
and tanks to launch an operation against the anarchic armed 
group." 
  "After a clash lasting about an hour and a half between the 
anarchic armed group -- which one source says consists of former 
Sereika movement troops led by Seng Phirom and Yim Vanna -- and 
the royal government security forces, the situation was calmed 
because many group members surrendered and others were arrested 
by the royal government forces. Realizing this unfavorable 
situation, the `ringleaders' of the anarchic group managed to 
escape and take along some weapons." 
  "According to preliminary reports on the operation to 
eliminate armed anarchy lasting a full afternoon on 18 February, 
many anarchic structures in the 200-hectare area were dismantled 
and burned by the combined forces. Furthermore, some forces 
have disclosed that as a result of this clash, the royal 
government's combined forces finally arrested 48 members of the 
anarchic group and the people staying in the area, including two 
women, and confiscated many weapons. "According to a reliable 
source, this brief armed clash resulted in a number of 
unspecified deaths and injuries." 
  The paper concludes the report saying that "on 18 February 
at 
about 0915, many members of the military police and the police 
force surrounded a building on Sivutha Road north of the Phsa 
Depo market in Tuol Kouk ward. The goal was to search and arrest 
some members" and that "a military policeman has disclosed that 
the combined forces arrested four suspects and took them to 
military police headquarters for questioning." According to 
this official, "what is regrettable is that a suspect, believed 
to be one of the ringleaders with the rank of major general, 
escaped before the search."

all types of Para Soldiers To Oppose Their Chiefs;" dated 19 
February -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] 1. On 18 February Tea Chamrat, Yu Hokkri, and Khan 
Savoeun -- Army offciers of FUNCINPEC [National United Front for 
an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] and 
co-ministers of national defense and security of the two-headed 
government -- led hundreds of soldiers and policemen with many 
tanks and armored vehicles and many large and small weapons to 
attack and burn 400 houses of other FUNCINPEC soldiers and their 
families and of other Para [troops of the Khmer People's 
National Liberation Front] soldiers in Stoeng Meanchey, 
Chaomchau [Phnom Penh suburb]. Fifteeen soldiers and their 
families died and over 30 were wounded; 60 were arrested. 
  2. The above savage and brutal act has caused all FUNCINPEC 
and other Para [Khmer People's National Liberation Front] 
soldiers to go through the roof with their anger. This 
represents FUNCINPEC Army officers and officials killing their 
men with their own hands. None of us ever thought this would 
happen. 
  What is the status of our chiefs now? Are they betraying 
their men? Are they colluding with the Hun Sen-Chea Sim group, 
lackeys of communist Vietnam? Can we remain with these chiefs? 
What should we do to stay alive? FUNCINPEC chiefs rounded us 
up to fight with no salary. Many of us died with no one caring 
for us. We starved and were very poor to the point of almost 
begging to stay alive. Our wives and children have been raped, 
oppressed, and exploited like animals. Land and houses have 
been plundered by our chiefs and we have practically nothing 
left. Our lives are constantly in the death pit. We asked for 
a salary, but were refused. We asked for a plot of land, but 
were also refused. They instead forced us to fight and die in 
great numbers, leaving our wives and children behind. There is 
no justice. They have been killing us. If puppets of communist 
Vietnam kill the nation and the people and plunder land and 
other property of the nation and people, they voice their 
support for this. 
  What should we do? We should fight back. We should flee and 
return to the farms, till the land, and grow crops to live as 
dignified persons. We should not be lackeys and allow ourselves 
to be killed at will. 
  For the commands of Divisions 9, 3, 11, 7, 8, 12, and 5 of 
ANKI [National Army of Independent Camabodia -- FUNCINPEC 
troops].

  [Text] Appeal to the fraternal soldiers of the 9th and 3d 
Divisions of the FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an

Anlung Veng battlefield: 
  1. The fraternal soldiers in FUNCINPEC's 9th and 3d 
Divisions have personally seen and experienced the casualties, 
shortages of food, and illnesses on the Anlung Veng battlefield. 
  2. In January and this February, you have seen and learned 
personally that hundreds of soldiers were killed or wounded and 
many dozens of them deserted their ranks everyday. 
  3. On 18 and 19 February alone, two generals, Phuong Siphan 
from Division 5 and (Pich Yeang) from Division 286 were killed. 
Four colonels, 12 other officers, and 109 soldiers were also 
killed; uncountable numbers of them were wounded; and 82 others 
were captured. On 18 February, a T-54 tank was captured and two 
more were destroyed. On 19 February, two other T- 54 tanks were 
destroyed. (?Kdei positions) of three regiments of Divisions 9 
and 3 were attacked and completely destroyed. Routed soldiers 
are fleeing in disarray into the jungle. They are suffering 
from food shortages and will not be able to avoid death. 
  4. The ringleaders of the Vietnamese communist puppets, such 
as Long Sopheap, Prum Samen, and Keo Pisit, have already fled to 
the rear, some to Bak Nim and some others to (?Samraong), 
leaving all of you to face death on the frontline. 
  5. For this reason, you should stop fighting. Stop fighting 
and quickly flee to Route 68 and back to your wives. Do not 
linger on to face death. Do not stay on for you might be killed.

  [Excerpts] PHNOM PENH, Feb 22 (AFP) -- Cambodian Government 
officials confirmed Tuesday that two of its generals had been 
killed, one in action against the Khmer Rouge and the other 
while removing a land mine the guerrilla faction had left behind. 
  General Sung Sothan was killed Friday while trying to 
dispose 
of a mine laid by the guerrillas near their major base at Anlung 
Veng, in northwest Cambodia, which the government seized early 
this month, said Toan Chay, governor of Siem Reap Province and 
commander of the 4th Military Region. Khmer Rouge guerrillas 
killed General Chean Eam the next day in a firefight north of 
Anlung Veng, near the Thai border, as government troops carried 
out mopping-up operations, he told AFP by telephone. The Khmer 
Rouge had reported the deaths earlier, but Toan Chay dismissed 
their claim to have killed an additional four lieutenant 
colonels, 12 other officers and 109 soldiers in fighting over 
the weekend. [passage omitted] 
  A Defence Ministry official said the casualty figures for 
the 
whole Anlung Veng operation so far was 40 government troops dead 
and 178 wounded, adding that the Khmer Rouge lost 128 guerrillas 
with some 139 others wounded. [passage omitted] 
  Co-Premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh also expressed his 
condolences and issued a note of caution. "I would like to 
express my sorrow at the deaths of the generals. This shows that 
although we have captured Anlung Veng we must be careful. We 
need to clean out the whole area," he said. 
  Government officials meanwhile dismissed a Khmer Rouge claim 
to have destroyed four tanks and captured a fifth during recent 
fighting around Anlung Veng. An Information Ministry spokesman 
said the government had not lost any tanks and claimed a picture 
published in a Bangkok newspaper Monday showing a group of Khmer 
Rouge guerrillas standing on top of what was supposed to be the 
captured tank was several years old. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, Prince Ranariddh said the government was still 
prepared to discuss with the Khmer Rouge a peace proposal put 
forward by King Norodom Sihanouk. The king suggested that 
certain "acceptable" members of the Khmer Rouge be given senior 
cabinet posts in return for the radical faction ceasing 
guerrilla activities, opening up its zones, and merging its 
fighters with the government's armed forces. "But up to now I 
have not received any letters or communication from the Khmer 
Rouge," the prince said. "The ball is still in the Khmer 
Rouge's court."

<F P=106> [By M.H. Tee: "Move on Khmer Rouge Positions Continue"] </F>
  [Excerpts] PHNOM PENH -- The Royal Army's concerted push 
towards Khmer Rouge positions through out the country is 
expected to continue until April when several key guerilla 
positions are to be captured. 
  Defence Minister Tie Banh told The CAMBODIA TIMES that the 
Royal Army was pushing forward to all of the Khmer Rouge 
positions in the country and not just Anlung Veng. It was 
learnt that the push has resulted in severe casualties on both 
sides, although most of the government soldiers were injured by 
mines, booby traps and other hazards in addition to accidents. 
  At least 70 government soldiers have been admitted to the 
army hospital in the capital here with injuries suffered mainly 
from mines and booby traps. Very few of the soldiers were 
injured in the exchange of fire with guerillas. Although 
military sources said that guerilla casualties were very much 
higher, it could not be determined as to what the actual figures 
are. Most of them were either dragged away by comrades or were 
left in dense foliage. 
  Morale among the government troops were also reportedly high 
when the initial push reportedly met with little resistance. In 
this instance, the government was right when it said that there 
was no large scale clashes but mere skirmishes. [passage 
omitted] Diplomatic sources said that the outcome of the battle 
depended very much on the morale of the troops, the command 
structure, as well as how cohesive the various armies which 
merged into the Royal Army. 
  It is no secret that some of the guerillas are fighting hard 
and have been in high spirits as they have been well paid and 
fed by their commanders. Although the same is probably true 
with the Royal Army, it is certainly more difficult given the 
strength of the army and the Royal Government's own financial 
constraints. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Letter from the Olympic market in Phnom Penh entitled: </F>
"The National Assembly Member and Traders at Olympic Market 
Expose the Two-Headed Government's Internal Dispute Over the 
Personal and Family Interests"] 
  [Excerpt] Following the dispute between Thai Boon Rong 
Company and the traders at Olympic market, there have been 
comments that Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh should not have 
sided with the puppet Hun Sen in opposing Sam Rangsi who is the 
vice chairman of the FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an 
Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] Party 
and finance minister of the two-headed government. 
  According to a National Assembly member from the FUNCINPEC 
Party, after the vendors at Olympic market protested against the 
Thai Boon Rong Company for greatly increasing the rent of their 
shops, not only had Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh failed to 
settle this problem as demanded by the vendors, but he sided 
with the puppet Hun Sen and Thai Boon Roong Company against Sam 
Rangsi, vice chairman of FUNCINPEC, who supported the protestors. 
  Phnom Penh residents know well that this Thai Boon Rong 
Company has joined hands with the ringleaders of the Vietnamese 
communist puppets, such as puppets Hun Sen and Chea Sim, in 
amassing and embezzling the wealth of the Cambodian nation and 
people worth hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars. During the 
elections organized by the UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in 
Cambodia], this company financed the Vietnamese communist 
puppets' Cambodian People's Party [CPP] in competition with 
FUNCINPEC and other parties. 
  Vendors at Olympic market said that if Prince Krompreah 
Norodom Ranariddh had the courage to arbitrate, this problem 
might have been settled. A dried fish vendor said that the 
Prince Krompreah dared not do anything but side with the 
Vietnamese puppets and this bloodsucking company because he is 
so afraid of the puppets Hun Sen and Sar Kheng. As a matter of 
fact, the prince is afraid of this Thai Boon Rong Company 
because it bought a personal plane for the prince. 
  A National Assembly member from FUNCINPEC added that Prince 
Krompreah should not have associated and curried favor with the 
puppet Hun Sen and the CPP. He should not have associated with 
Thai Boon Rong Company, which subsidized the puppets in carrying 
out their election campaigns against FUNCINPEC and in killing 
many FUNCINPEC members. Prince Krompreah's activity has led him 
to a conflict with traders, the masses in Phnom Penh, and even 
with his fellow FUNCINPEC members to the point that he even 
wanted to drive out FUNCINPEC Vice Chairman Sam Rangsi as 
finance minister. 
  According to reliable sources in the Finance Ministry in 
Phnom Penh, in addition to Thai Boon Roong, there have also been 
problems with the French oil company [name indistinct]. The 
sources said that Sam Rangsi signed an agreement with this 
company, but the Vietnamese puppets in the two-headed government 
refused to recognize Sam Rangsi's signature. This is because 
they want to deal with only a Vietnamese company [name 
indistinct] through which they can monopolize the profits for 
themselves and their CPP. Here, Prince Krompreah Norodom 
Ranariddh also sided with the puppet Hun Sen against Sam Rangsi. 
  Almost all the masses in Phnom Penh, including students, 
civil servants, and traders in market places, have said that 
members of the two-headed government do not have any policy nor 
have they done anything for the interests of the Cambodian 
nation and people. They only want to serve the Vietnamese 
communists and foreign companies and to gain profits for 
themselves and their families. This is why all the problems have 
not been resolved. Some have said that if they were not 
protected by the Vietnamese police and the allies, these 
two-headed government members would have been dead from the 
outset. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Statement by the Party of Democratic Kampuchea spokesman on </F>
19 February; place not given -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] 1. Hanoi communist Vietnamese Foreign Minister 
Nguyen Manh Cam was in Phnom Penh from 16 to 18 February. On 
that occasion, he announced that it was necessary to set up a 
commission to negotiate the border problem and the issue of 
sending Vietnamese nationals to Cambodia. 
  This was a very base and perfidious maneuver to enable the 
communist Vietnamese to legalize their annexation of Cambodia's 
land, seas, and islands by the tens of thousands of square 
kilometers and to legitimize the nearly four million Vietnamese 
nationals who have immigrated into Cambodia since 1979. 
  2. The party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] denounces and 
condemns with the utmost severity and indignation this savage 
and treacherous maneuver of the Hanoi communist Vietnamese, 
which is part of the concrete implementation of the late Ho Chi 
Minh's strategy of swallowing up Cambodia. 
  The question of Cambodia's territorial integrity and 
sovereignty is not negotiable. The communist Vietnamese must 
respect and abide by the pre-1970 Cambodia-Vietnam joint 
declaration and subsequent international agreements, especially 
the 23 October 1991 Paris agreement concerning Cambodia's 
territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence and the 
inviolability of Cambodia's borders. 
  If the communist Vietnamese want good relations with 
neighboring countries and desire regional peace and stability, 
they must respect Cambodia's territorial integrity within its 
land and sea borders, which was internationally recognized 
between 1963 and 1969 in accordance with the UN Charter and 
other international laws. 
  As far as the nearly four million Vietnamese nationals sent 
to Cambodia since 1979 are concerned, their true nature is that 
of an aggressive force trying to annex Cambodia. In the past, 
they served as an abundant source of auxiliary force for the 
communist Vietnamese aggressive troops. At present, they are 
the instrument of the Hanoi communist Vietnamese in implementing 
their strategy of swallowing up Cambodian territory and 
exterminating the Cambodian race through demographic warfare. 
In this capacity, all types of Vietnamese aggressive forces 
must be totally pulled out of Cambodia. The Cambodian nation, 
people, and national resistance forces should not be held 
responsible for anything that might happen to these communist 
Vietnamese forces of aggression. All nations, peoples, and 
countries will always rise up and fight foreign forces of 
aggression in order to defend themselves, protect their own 
right to live, and oppose external aggression and interference, 
which constitutes the most elementary principle of the universal 
declaration on human rights. 
  3. The Cambodian nation and people and the national 
resistance forces of Democratic Kampuchea are closely monitoring 
to see whether the two-headed government is being taken in by 
the base and perfidious legalization maneuver of the Hanoi 
communist Vietnamese. 
  Issuing the joint communique with the communist Vietnamese 
accepting negotiations on the question of Cambodia's territorial 
integrity and border is tantamount to giving the communist 
Vietnamese a free hand to legalize their annnexation of 
Cambodian territory grabbed since 1979. Any party or individual 
who is taken in by the communist Vietnamese maneuver allowing 
them to swallow Cambodian territories and send their nationals 
to turn Cambodia into a second Kampuchea Kraom must be held 
responsible before the nation, the people, and the history of 
Cambodia. 
  [Dated] 19 February 1994 
  [Signed] The spokesman of the PDK

  [Text] PHNOM PENH -- The Royal Government and locals must 
have the majority stake in any joint venture agreements with 
foreign companies. In addition to this, the country must also 
follow the example of many countries, among them Thailand, who 
do not allow foreign ownership of land and buildings. 
  There are legal systems which can be put in place which will 
preserve the interests of this nation and will still be 
acceptable to foreign investors. 
  In making this call, Son Sann, the Dean of the Members of 
the 
National Assembly, said in a statement: "The great misery 
endured by this nation dates back to 1970. Then, we witnessed 
the ruthless exploitation of our natural resources without 
profit or gain for our people." 
  "As such, there is a necessity in establishing an investment 
code. This code would reflect a reasonable degree of liberalism 
being based on mutual profit to encourage foreign investments 
but would also act to preserve our national interests." 
  "When I said the preserving of our national interests, I 
specifically meant to preserve our present interests which still 
remain to be preserved, as well as those of future generations," 
he said. 
  He added that it was within this perspective that he 
proposed 
(while waiting for an investment code reflecting a reasonable 
liberalisation, conceived with good consensus by the Royal 
Government and the National Assembly, with the present and 
future interests of our nation at heart) some necessary measures 
of precaution. 
  "Contracts not approved by the Supreme National Council or 
by 
the Royal Government should be cancelled or reviewed again. The 
occupation of certain economically important regions such as 
harbours, must be of a limited duration." 
  "We must make provision in these zones for a privileged zone 
to be reserved for locals and also a zone to be managed 
primarily by the Royal Government and, therefore, to be kept for 
future generations." 
  "With new friends and new accords currently being made, the 
Royal Government will certainly be able to obtain better 
conditions for our nation," Son Sann pointed out. 
  He added that with regards to oil exploration, fisheries and 
electricity, it would be desirable in the negotiations to have 
the collaboration of neutral and competent specialists, in 
particular well known local specialist residents in France or 
elsewhere who are current in their respective fields of research.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 19 (KCNA) -- A joint statement 
of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] and the Communist Party of 
Uruguay [CPU] was published in Pyongyang on February 17. 
  According to the joint statement, a delegation of the 
Communist Party of Uruguay composed of Executive Secretary 
General Petro Balbi and the executive member and international 
secretary of the Central Committee of the Party visited the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea from Feb. 11 to 17, 1994, 
on the invitation of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party 
of Korea. 
  During its stay in Korea, talks were held between the 
delegations of the two parties, at which the sides informed each 
other of their conditions and activities and exchanged views on 
a series of matters of common concern about the present 
international situation and reached a consensus on the 
fundamental matters discussed. 
  The WPK expressed firm solidarity with the CPU in its 
efforts 
to develop the party on the principle of Marxism-Leninism and 
its struggle against the "neo-liberalistic" strategy of the 
imperialists, after it reaffirmed the continued maintenance of 
the socialist idea and its working-class nature. 
  The CPU noted with high appreciation that the Korean people 
singleheartedly united around the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, are 
confidently defending and advancing the socialist cause under 
difficult conditions in which the imperialists are persisting in 
their anti-socialist, anti-DPRK moves, and expressed full 
support and solidarity for it. 
  It also manifested full support to the struggle of the 
Workers' Party and people of Korea to achieve the reunification 
of the country in the form of confederation based on one nation, 
one state, two systems and two governments on the basis of the 
three principles of independence, peaceful reunification and 
great national unity laid down by Comrade Kim Il-song. 
  The sides shared the view that an immediate end must be put 
to the unwarrantable acts of the western powers, particularly, 
the United States, in violating the inviolable principles of 
self-determination of peoples and non-interference in the 
internal affairs of each country, exercising privileges in the 
international arena. 
  They expressed their willingness to make joint efforts to 
destroy all the old international political and economic orders 
of domination and subjugation and establish new orders based on 
equality, justice and social progress.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 18 (KCNA) -- Speeches were made 
at the enlarged meeting of the Executive Committee of the 
International Liaison Committee for Reunification and Peace in 
Korea [Cilreco] held in Paris on February 6. 
  Speaking at the meeting, the honorary chairman of the 
Cilreco, George Pattas, former Greek general, said what is 
exasperating with regard to the nuclear issue of the Korean 
peninsula is that the United States is incoherent in its stand. 
  "I think if the Clinton administration is willing to find a 
peaceful solution to the acute nuclear issue of the Korean 
peninsula through bilateral talks between the DPRK and the 
United States it must adopt its decision properly at the 
present crucial juncture," he said. 
  Robert Parry, British Labour member of the House of Commons, 
said the prevailing situation requires that the essence of the 
nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula should be laid bare and 
the solidarity movement for supporting the Korean people's cause 
of reunification conducted more vigorously in diverse forms and 
ways. 
  He said when the international solidarity movement for 
supporting the just cause of the Korean people is intensified 
the United States will not be able to impose any kind of 
"sanctions" on the DPRK and, even if it is possible to do so, it 
is bound to end in failure. 
  Lawyer Stanley Faulkner, vice-chairman of the Cilreco and 
chairman of the U.S. Lawyers Committee on Korea, said the United 
States' deployment of nuclear weapons in South Korea is a crude 
violation of the Korean armistice agreement that prohibits the 
introduction of new weapons and military hardware from outside 
Korea, and called for an immediate pullout of the nuclear 
weapons from South Korea. 
  He stressed that war rehearsals of the U.S. should be 
stopped at once as they run counter to the U.N. charter on 
stopping threat to world peace and solving problems through 
peaceful means. 
  Roberto Gabriele, general secretary of the Movement for 
Peace 
and Socialism of Italy, said the Cilreco struggling for the 
reunification and peace of Korea should lay bare the essence of 
the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula by keeping in close 
contact with the committees for friendship and solidarity with 
the Korean people across the world and launch an international 
campaign to check and frustrate the anti-DPRK moves of the 
United States and its followers. Prof. Paulette Pierson at 
Libre University in Brussels, Belgium called on the U.N. 
Commission on Human Rights and governmental and 
non-governmental organizations to lay bare through international 
arenas the nature of the Kim Yong-sam "civilian" regime and 
build up widespread international opinion supporting the 
democratization of the South Korean society and Korea's 
reunification. 
  Joe Debono Greck, Maltese Labour member of Parliament, 
exposed the persistent despicable moves of some force of the 
United States to foil the DPRK-U.S. talks, saying it is a big 
mistake if the United States and its followers think they can 
frighten the Korean people united in one mind with pressure and 
threat and representative of the Sandinist National Liberation 
Front of Nicaragua Esmeralda Cardenas said if Kim Yong-sam truly 
wants the reunification he should tear down the concrete wall 
without hesitation as it is a product of the cold war that was 
built by the military dictatorial "regime". The secretary 
general of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, 
Amar Bentoumi, former minister of justice of Algeria, called on 
the progressive lawyers of all countries in the world who love 
justice and peace to launch into an international campaign 
urging the United States to abandon its hostile policy aimed at 
stifling the DPRK and implement the principles stipulated in 
the DPRK-U.S. joint statement in good faith. 
  Speeches supporting the Korean people's cause of national 
reunification were also made at the meeting by Robert Charvin, 
secretary general of the International Committee of Jurists for 
Democracy and Human Rights in South Korea; Basco Hago Fernandes, 
chairman of the Democratic Intervention of Portugal; Jaime 
Ballesteros, international secretary of the Communist Party of 
the Peoples of Spain, and other figures.

the principled stand of the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea for a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  Indrajit Gupta said the National Council of his party 
denounces the United States for bringing the talks between the 
DPRK and the U.S. to a rupture and hopes for a final solution 
of the nuclear issue through a peaceful negotiation. 
  The C.C., the Communist Party of India (Marxist) said the 
situation created by the U.S. Government clearly shows that the 
United States is trying to force the DPRK to accept a 
comprehensive inspection, not an inspection of the scope agreed 
upon, by using the International Atomic Energy Agency as a 
serviceable tool for gathering information on Korea for the 
imperialists, and intensify military plots against the DPRK by 
gaining time. 
  A solidarity message supporting the Korean people's cause of 
national reunification was also sent to the C.C., the WPK by the 
C.C., the Communist Party of Argentina. Expressing militant 
solidarity with the WPK, the DPRK Government and people in their 
just struggle for the peace and peaceful reunification of the 
country, it voiced full support for the Korean people's cause of 
defending the banner of socialism and safeguarding the 
sovereignty of the country.

Chong-il is an outstanding thinker and theoretician who has 
performed great feats for the development of thought and 
theories of mankind by steadily developing in depth the chuche 
idea". He said His Excellency Kim Chong-il is exalting the 
chuche idea founded by President Kim Il-song as the most correct 
guiding idea of the era of independence by conducting 
ideological and theoretical activities with rare wisdom and 
energy. 
  "His Excellency Kim Chong-il said the independent driving 
force of history is the integral whole of the leader, the party 
and the masses and the socio-political organism in which they 
share the same destiny and gave a new exposition of the position 
and role of the leader, the party and the masses in the 
socio-political organism and the basic principle of uniting the 
organism," he pointed out. 
  Mono Ndjana Hubert, former secretary of the People's 
Democratic Rally of Cameroon and head of the chair of philosophy 
of the Yaounde No. 1 University and director of the Board of the 
African Regional Committee for the Study of the Chuche Idea, in

the Lagos State Government of Nigeria and director of the Board 
of the African Regional Committee for the Study of the Chuche 
Idea and chairman of the Nigerian National Committee for the 
Study of the Chuche Idea, said in his speech: 
  "As it correctly reflects the demand of the popular masses 
for independence and fully clarifies the way of carrying it into 
reality, Kimilsungism has become the guiding idea representing a 
new era in which the popular masses have emerged as the masters 
of their destiny, and the guideline for building an independent 
new society." 
  Joseph Matseka, chairman of the Harare Provincial Committee 
of the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front and a 
parliamentarian and vice-chairman of the Zimbabwean National 
Committee for the Study of the Chuche Idea, in his speech on the

building new independent world". He said that the chuche idea 
is the most valuable wealth of the people in the era of 
independence and called for more brisk dissemination and study 
of this idea worldwide. 
  Mbonigaba Stanislas, councillor of the Ministry of Health 
and 
chairman of the Rwandan Committee for the Study of the Chuche 
Idea, noted that to strengthen the unity of the popular masses

Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front, director of the 
board of the African Regional Committee for the Study of the 
Chuche Idea and chairman of the Zimbabwean National Committee

South-South cooperation among themselves. 
  Baguma Isoke, member of the National Resistance Council, 
vice-director for youths of the mass mobilisation department of 
the secretariat of the national resistance movement of Uganda 
and chairman of the Ugandan National Committee for the Study of 
the Chuche Idea, said in his speech that the political formula 
of Western-style "democracy" does not suit the conditions of 
African countries theoretically and practically and called for 
drawing on the experiences of Korea in establishing the 
political formula of progressive democracy based on collectivist 
outlook on life.

Committee for Friendship with the People of the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea on February 10 called on the 
peaceloving people and revolutionary and friendship 
organizations across the world to defend great Korea for

  It stressed that to defend Korea means to safeguard world 
peace and security, crop the U.S. feathers, defend the bastion 
of the world revolution and build an independent world and bring 
a bright future earlier.

  [Text] The dignity and glory of the DPRK have been 
brilliant all over the world under the splendid banner of 
chuche. The people's genuine life has come into full bloom in 
the socialist fatherland's rivers and mountains. 
  During the revolutionary turning year when our country's 
socialist construction enters a new developing stage, we have 
glorified with loyalty and feats the worthwhile year of struggle 
when all the party, all the Army, and all the people should be 
mobilized to bring about the great revolutionary upsurge in all 
front lines. The morning of the most meaningful day -- the 
February national day -- breaks in the chuche-oriented 
fatherland. 
  With the unfolding of the history of a new year, 1994, full 
of confidence and optimism, the February national day is the 
greatest national felicitous day for which everyone has 
earnestly waited. 
  On the morning of the meaningful February national day, the 
people's minds have been constant, like the blue pine trees in 
the forests of Mt. Paektu, and have been clear, like the waters 
of Mt. Sobaek, and are going toward the secret camp -- the 
native home in Mt. Paektu. Mt. Paektu's secret camp is the 
native home where the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, the 
sagacious leader [chidoja] of our party and people and the 
supreme commander of the Korean People's Army [KPA], was born. 
  The voices of the anti-Japanese fighters that were raised 
when they experienced the greatest national felicitous day in 
this humble house now seem to ring out. The future of Korea is 
brilliant, because Mt. Paektu's bright star is brilliant. 
  Indeed, the birth of Mt. Paektu's bright star was a 
grandiose 
sunrise of the great guiding star that will inherit and complete 
the chuche revolutionary cause pioneered by the great leader 
[suryong], was a historic event that promised the brilliant 
future of mankind, and was a great national fortune that we 
should uphold another great man with the Mt. Paektu's legendary 
hero and the anti-Japanese female general. 
  Our people have enjoyed the great happiness and glory 
through 
16 February. The immortal chuche idea has brought into full 
play a stronger magnetism and invincible vitality. The party's 
leadership has become the lifeline, thus all the party, all the 
Army, and all the people have breathed and acted with a single 
ideology and consciousness and the chuche-oriented socialist 
cause has been victoriously advanced. This reality shows our 
party's authority and might. 
  All the people have been firmly united around the party with 
fidelity. The communist virtue of devoting all sincerity and 
even life to society, groups, and comrades is the genuine 
appearance of our society. 
  A heyday in all fields, including politics, economy, 
military, and culture, has been unveiled. The revolutionary 
line of independence, self-reliance, and self-defense in 
national defense bears brilliant fruit in our country. This is 
the outstanding pride and might of our country. 
  Socialism of our own style has pressed hard on the heels of 
the enemy without wavering in the face of vicious challenge and 
threat and of the moves of separation and blockade by 
imperialists and reactionaries. Our people have been proud of 
this glorious era in combination with the esteemed name of the 
dear leader comrade. 
  All dignity, glory, and happiness that our people enjoy are 
the greatest privilege and fortune that can be obtained only by 
upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il -- great leader 
with [yongdoja] literary and military accomplishments, loyalty, 
and filial duty; and outstanding ideological theoretician, 
politician, and military strategist; and model of loyalist 
unfailingly faithful to the fatherland the people -- at the head 
of the party and the revolutionary Armed Forces. 
  On the morning of the February national day, all the people 
across the country are looking up to the building of the party 
Central Committee on which our glorious party's flag is 
unfurling. 
  The compatriots in South Korea and overseas and world 
revolutionary people turn their envious eyes upon Pyongyang. 
The people upholding the great leader [yongdoja] are the 
happiest people. The people who do not uphold the great leader 
are the unhappiest people. This is truth. Looking around 
today's world, our people deeply feel this truth and they have 
deeply experienced the truth through their lives. All of our 
people have the great glory and happiness of upholding the great 
leader [yongdoja]. 
  We extend the greatest glory and warmhearted thanks to the 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. We deeply wish General Kim 
Chong-il, our supreme commander, long life and good health. 
  Our people's wish contains not only the absolute faith that 
we and the fatherland cannot exist without you, but also the 
ever- victorious confidence that we can win a victory if you 
exist. The dear leader comrade has tided over all tribulations 
with firm will and matchless grit and turned adversity into 
prosperity by single- heartedly rallying the hundreds of 
thousands of people through broad-scope politics and the 
politics of benevolence. 
  With the great grit of never being shaken by any thunder and 
lightening and with unrivalled strategy of [word indistinct] 
everything in the world, the dear leader comrade makes millions 
of enemies tremble. Our people have been convinced that as long 
as there is the dear leader comrade, there is nothing that our 
people fear and cannot implement. 
  Thus, even when the enemies brought the dark clouds of a 
nuclear war and threatened our people while talking about 
special inspections and collective sanctions, our people were 
not shaken at all. No matter how hard the imperialists may 
maneuver to separate and blockade us, our people, upholding the 
party's revolutionary economic strategy, have brought into full 
play the grit of self-reliance and fortitude and the might of 
single-hearted unity. 
  On the morning marking the great national felicitous 
national 
day, the only wish cherished deep in the people's mind is long 
life and good health of the leader comrade. 
  We wholeheartedly wish the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il--fate of our nation, fate of the country, great 
defender of the socialist cause, and symbol of victory--long 
life and good health for the sake of the completion and victory 
of socialism of our own style, independent reunification of the 
country, realization of turning the whole world into 
independence, endless happiness of our people, and the 
prosperity of the country for good.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Our People's Great Pride of Carrying </F>
Out the Revolution Along the Road Elucidated by the Great 
Ideology and Theory"] 
  [Text] Our people, who greet the February national day -- 
the most glorious day of our nation -- are overflowing with a 
great dignity and pride of victoriously carrying out the 
revolution and construction without the slightest deviation or 
vicissitudes along the road elucidated by the great ideology and 
theory that the dear leader Comrade has expounded. 
  The socialist cause is the cause that the scientific leading 
ideology can only guide. Today's reality in which socialism has 
collapsed in many countries and in which it temporarily suffers 
vicissitudes clearly proves that the socialist cause can be 
consummated only if the great leading ideology exists. To 
safeguard, adhere to, and glorify the socialist cause, it is 
imperative to strongly make the popular masses arm themselves 
with the socialist ideology. 
  The leader [yongdoja] of the revolution, the outstanding 
thinker and theoretician, can only carry out the cause for the 
development and consummation of the socialist ideology in 
conformity with the demands of the times and the developing 
revolution. The most important mission assigned to him, who 
leads the socialist cause, is to clearly elucidate the future 
road of the popular masses' cause for independence -- the 
socialist cause -- by developing the revolutionary leading 
ideology. 
  The socialist cause becomes ever-victorious today in our 
country, because it is being led by the great ideology and 
theory expounded by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. With 
his far-sighted wisdom, extraordinary faculties of inquiry, and 
boundless energy, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has 
glorified the chuche idea created by the respected and beloved 
leader [suryong] as the great leading ideology of the 
independent era. 
  The respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song has 
taught: Comrade Kim Chong-il is glorifying our party's chuche 
idea as the great leading ideology in the era of independence by 
conducting ideological and theoretical activity with his 
extraordinary faculties of inquiry and energy. 
  The revolutionary leading ideology cannot be completed at a 
moment, but instead can be completed in the course of 
generalizing the experience of the revolutionary struggle based 
on the conditions of the times and history. After proving its 
truth in a protracted struggle, the ideology can be completed as 
a monolithic ideological and theoretical system. 
  The chuche idea created by the great leader [suryong] has 
demonstrated its invincible vitality through the protracted 
revolutionary practice and is being constantly deepened and 
developed. The historical tasks to sum up, systemize, develop, 
and consummate the principle of the chuche idea have been 
brilliantly carried out by the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il's energetic, ideological, and theoretical activity. 
  Based on his deep study of the contents constituting the 
basic principle and quintessence of the chuche idea, the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has formulized the respected and 
beloved leader's revolutionary ideology into the monolithic 
system of method, the ideology and theory of chuche. Therefore, 
this great revolutionary ideology has been glorified as the 
leading ideology of the times and revolution along with the 
respected and beloved leader's esteemed name. 
  With the new principles and contents, the dear leader 
Comrade 
Kim Chong-il has further enriched the chuche idea and fully 
deepened and developed it in conformity with the demands of the 
present times and the developing revolution. Ranging from the 
chuche philosophical principle and the social historical 
principle to the theory of the chuche of revolution, the theory 
of the sociopolitical organism, and the principle of the chuche 
view of revolution, all of these theories of the chuche idea, 
which have been deepened and developed by the dear comrade 
leader, are constituted by the profound contents, principles, 
and theses. 
  The chuche idea has been fully enriched, deepened, and 
developed based on the new principles and contents. As a 
result, it has been the leading ideology in elucidating the 
future road of the popular masses -- who want to become the 
masters of the world and their destinies by thoroughly remolding 
nature, society, and human beings themselves -- as well as the 
leading guideline that the people carrying out the revolution 
should always firmly adhere to. 
  The chuche idea in our times is becoming the leading 
ideology 
in the era of independence. It is also vigorously leading 
hundreds of million people throughout the world to the single 
road of independence by firmly griping their hearts. Today it 
is a global trend to follow and learn the chuche idea. 
  Actually, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's ideology 
and 
theory are the great ideology and theory that have further 
enriched the chuche idea and, at the same time, have deepened 
and developed it into a new higher stage in conformity with the 
demands of the present times and the developing revolution. It 
is also a combatant banner that leads the socialist cause in our 
times to the ever-victorious single road. 
  The great revolutionary ideology is a result of the 
energetic 
ideological and theoretical activity by the outstanding thinker 
and theoretician. The ideological and theoretical activity by 
the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who has developed and 
enriched the immortal chuche idea and who has glorified it as 
the great leading ideology in the era of independence, is 
incomparably prominent and extraordinary. 
  Based on revolutionary practice in our times, the dear 
leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il is thoroughly studying all ideologies and 
theories and, also, originally developing them. The great 
ideology and theory that will lead the socialist cause to the 
victory can be derived from the revolutionary practice. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has always satisfied 
the 
demands of the times and the developing reality with his 
theoretical faculties of inquiry and basic principles of [word 
indistinct], not by the preconceived theories nor existing 
experience. Also, he has regarded it as a cornerstone of his 
ideological and theoretical activity to give a scientific 
solution to the demands. 
  The pressing historic tasks arising in our present times are 
to resolutely safeguard and adhere to the socialist cause 
against the imperialists and betrayers to socialism and to 
endlessly consummate it. Based on his deep analysis of the 
tragic event, the so-called collapse of socialism, the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has expounded the great ideology and 
theory to safeguard and adhere to the socialist cause and to 
victoriously consummate it. 
  The basic reason of the collapse of socialism and the 
socialist ruling parties has been scientifically elucidated in a 
great number of works -- such as "Historic Lesson of Socialist 
Construction and General Line of Our Party," "On the Fundamental 
Question of Revolutionary Party Building," and "Abuses of 
Socialism Are Intolerable" -- published by the dear comrade 
leader. These works have defined the course of socialism and 
the future road of the revolutionary party building. 
  In this way, the dear comrade leader's ideological and 
theoretical activity has always been carried out in conformity 
with the demands of the times and the concrete revolutionary 
practice. We cannot talk about the dear comrade leader's 
speculation and research without the struggle to safeguard and 
adhere to socialism. 
  By conducting the ideological and theoretical activity with 
his thorough practice, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il was 
able to seek the valuable truth that can give solution to the 
theoretical and practical problems in the implementation of the 
socialist cause in our times, as well as to gain an immortal 
achievement in the revolutionary cause of the working class. 
  Also, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's ideology and 
theory are characterized as profound and encyclopedic. The 
socialist cause raises a great number of the theoretical and 
practical problems -- unexpected, complicated, and difficult -- 
in our present time. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has 
given clear solutions to them, small or big, in the revolution 
and construction. 
  The dear comrade leader's ideological and theoretical 
activity has affected all fields, including politics, economy, 
military affairs, and culture. He has also given an ideological 
and theoretical solution to all problems arising in party 
building, state building, and armed construction, as well as in 
carrying out the external work and the cause for the national 
reunification. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has solved, 
one by one, all problems profoundly, perfectly, and 
philosophically, while dealing with the ideological and 
theoretical problems in the various fields. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's ideological and 
theoretical activity has also possessed the thorough 
serve-the-people spirit. The dear comrade leader has always 
conducted the ideological and theoretical activity among the 
popular masses. He has always gone down to the masses by saying 
that his command, leadership ability, and virtues can be 
originated from the popular masses. Thus, he has expounded the 
valuable ideology and theory after listening to the popular 
masses' voices, reflecting their aspiration and desire, and 
analyzing and summing up their struggling experience. 
Therefore, our party's ideology and theory are an expression of 
the popular masses' aspiration and desire. 
  Because of his correct reflection of the popular masses' 
aspiration and desire, the people have accepted the dear comrade 
leader's ideology and theory as their firm and solid faith and 
will. The enrichness, encyclopedic nature, profoundness, and 
creativeness of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's ideology 
and theory cannot be possible without his outstanding wisdom and 
extraordinary faculties of inquiry. 
  From the very beginning, the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il 
has had a great knowledge of all fields. Also, he has possessed 
his prominent insight, analytic thinking, extraordinary memory, 
and faculties of inquiry as his natural gifts. Because he has 
such extraordinary gifts and ideological and theoretical 
abilities, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has brilliantly 
carried out historical tasks -- which cannot be done by anyone 
-- in our times and has led the socialist cause to the single 
road of victory. 
  The dear comrade leader's ideology and theory is a 
revolutionary banner that inspires the spirit of the world 
revolutionaries, as well as the world progressive people who 
struggle for sovereignty, independence, and socialism, and that 
elucidates their future road. Today the revolutionary people 
seek ways to promote their advance based on the dear comrade 
leader's ideology and theory. They are more vigorously 
conducting their struggles to restore the socialist cause, 
overflowing with conviction and spirit of vigor. 
  The driving force and invincible vitality of the great 
ideology and theory are being vigorously proven with each 
passing day. Our people are overflowing with boundless dignity 
and pride of carrying out the revolution with the great ideology 
and theory that glorify the chuche idea along with the esteemed 
name of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. They have firmly 
resolved to more thoroughly embody his ideology and theory at 
the risk of their lives. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has gained a greater 
achievement with his energetic activity of ideology and theory. 
This achievement will shine forever along with the people's 
struggle for socialism in our times.

<F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 16 February article: "We Will Win Only If You </F>
Are With Us"] 
  [Text] One great faith is ringing the era and history. Our 
people who are vigorously advancing along the single road of 
socialism of chuche, firmly united as one mind around the great 
leader [widaehan yongdoja], are loudly expressing the faith in 
the certain victory that we will win only if you are with us. 
Today when a troubled and chaotic atmosphere of confusion and 
pessimism is increasing everywhere in the world due to the 
raging storm of counterrevolution, we hear the exciting 
exclamation that was heard in Korea of the sixties as a victor's 
answer! Why is this exciting exclamation so strongly hitting the 
hearts of a countless number of people and creating the waves of 
excitement in today's struggle and life of ours? We will win 
only if you are with us. Here, the great, firm faith in certain 
victory of our times, in which our people are staunchly 
traversing the road of socialist march, while fighting their way 
through all sorts of formidable adversities, is oscillating 
profoundly. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Because 
Comrade Kim Chong-il is outstandingly inheriting our 
revolutionary cause everything is being properly carried out in 
our country today and will be properly carried out in the 
future, too. 
  Faith in certain victory is synonymous with faith in the 
leader [yongdoja]. The faith in certain victory which one can 
have comes from one's awareness of the greatness of the leader 
[yongdoja] and one's absolute trust in him. We will win only if 
you are with us. This is a solemn declaration of the faith in 
the certain victory of our people who have keenly felt through 
their formidable and complicated struggle that the dear comrade 
leader is the destiny of the fatherland and the symbol of 
victory and who have firmly believed the final victory of 
socialism through his greatness. 
  Greeting the February holiday, a significant day in the 
history of our nation and country, this morning our people's 
hearts are soothing with the ideological feeling of upholding 
the great leader [widaehan yongdoja] with one mind of reverence 
and excitement. What is bursting forth from the hearts of the 
people who are running to the native house in the secret camp of 
Mt. Paektu where snow flowers bloom; from the hearts of those 
people who are visiting significant historic sites of the 
revolution with red Kim Chong-il flowers despite the cold 
weather in February; from the hearts of officers and men of the 
Korean People's Army who are cultivating their strength of 
annihilating the enemies, cherishing in their hearts the dignity 
and honor of upholding the great commander; from the hearts of 
the working class who are holding aloft the flames of innovation 
under deep deadends in mine galleries, upholding the party's 
revolutionary economic strategy; and from the hearts of 
functionaries who are devotedly working, mingling with the 
masses? It is precisely our people's absolute trust in the dear 
comrade leader and their firm faith that we will win if only you 
are with us. 
  An old hero in Kangson revealed his excited mind as follow: 
We will win only if you are with us. This word is precisely the 
faith which makes our hearts burn and which gives us strength 
and courage. No matter what storm may blow and may hit earth we 
will always be victorious only if General Kim Chong-il is with 
us. 
  We will win only if you are with us. This word is not only 
Korea's spirit of the times, which is burning in our struggle 
and life, but is also a vigorous pulse of all of our struggles 
and advances and a strong mettle of our nation. 
  Faith is trust. Human beings should have trust. The people 
who are carrying out the revolution should have the pillar of a 
firm mind. Trust is the faith and will that enable one to be 
true to one's principle and conscience under all adversities and 
trails. It is the burning zeal and fighting spirit that make it 
possible to surmount any difficulties. It is also the faith, 
vitality, and mettle that make it possible to advance toward a 
bright future without faltering. 
  Without trust we cannot avoid the destiny of endless 
despair, 
frustration, and destruction -- like a ship that has lost a 
compass on a ocean. The supreme trust of human beings is 
precisely the trust in his leader. 
  Christians [kyoin] believe in God as the savior of their 
destiny, and capitalists believe in only money in the world. 
  A person who embodies genuine truths and great power in the 
highest form in the world is the leader [yongdoja] of the 
revolution. The leader [yongdoja] of the revolution who leads 
the popular masses into the cause of independence and pushes 
ahead with history gives one ideas and ideology, wisdom and 
courage, and strength for unity and invincibility. 
  General Kim Chong-il is our heaven [hanul]. Because our 
heaven is boundlessly high and because our heaven is glorious 
eternally, our hearts feel secure [uriui maumi tundunhago], and 
our future is bright. 
  General Kim Chong-il: When we cherish his (?noble call) to 
our hearts, chuche-oriented truths lit our heads and the blood 
of loyalty rushes through our hearts. When we call his great 
noble name, the fire of determination flickers in our eyes and 
the might of 12 (?generals) springs from our hands. 
  Great experiences give rise to genuine truths. People 
consider truths -- which they learned from history, realized 
through experiences, and verified through lives and struggles -- 
to be their belief. Our people has come to have absolute trust 
for General Kim Chong-il not because any textbook or book or 
anyone teaches them to do so. Already a half century ago the 
first generation of our revolution [word indistinct] celebrated 
the birth of the bright star of Mt. Paektu as the nation's [word 
indistinct]. They wrote: The bright star of Mt. Paektu is an 
uncommon, great man who will glorify 10 thousand generations of 
our nation on trees in all mountains, fields, and rivers in this 
country. 
  How is Korea continuously walking along the single road of 
socialism in high spirits without being shaken or chaotic even 
when socialism has collapsed in many countries of the world and 
when the cold wind of imperialism is violently sweeping the 
entire world? How are revolution and construction advancing more 
vigorously and why are all people smiling happy smiles at a time 
the imperialists are desperately maneuvering to crush [apsal] 
us? From where does this strong nerve, which no political and 
ideological offensives can shake, which no nuclear weapons can 
frighten, or which no money can lure, come? This is possible 
due to our people's absolute trust for General Kim Chong-il. 
  Our people absolutely trust General Kim Chong-il, who is the 
great leader [yongdoja] of our party and people and the supreme 
commander of our revolutionary Armed Forces. 
  Our wisdom and courage in turning adversity into advantage, 
the might of our single-hearted unity in creating miracles of 
the century, and the strong spirit of our invincible Armed 
Forces: All of this might comes from the wise leadership of 
great General Kim Chong-il. 
  People who carry out the revolution believe their leader, 
their leader [chagi suryong chagi yongdoja], and firmly believe 
in the victory of the revolution based on the greatness of their 
leader, their leader [chagi suryong chagi yongdoja]. 
  Standing at the podium of the historic eighth League of 
Socialist Working Youth Congress in which our young people 
consolidated their determination to become 5 million people like 
Yi Su-pok and 5 million guns and bombs that resolutely defend 
Supreme Commander General Kim Chong-il, a representative 
expressed the following resolve: People ask us how socialism is 
ever-victorious in Korea without being shaken when socialism has 
collapsed in many countries of the world. Every time, we answer 
filled with pride that we have a great man of the century and a 
society idealistic to mankind. Supreme Commander Marshal Kim 
Chong-il is our heaven [hanul], and the chuche-oriented 
socialism is our earth [ttang]. Because our heaven is high and 
because our earth is solid, we are victorious all the time. 
  This is [words indistinct] for General Kim Chong-il, who is 
the great leader [yongdoja]. 
  Trust for General Kim Chong-il: This gives our people 
absolute confidence, absolute optimism, and a philosophy for a 
great victory in our era. 
  While walking along tens of millions of ri of revolutionary 
roads under the dear comrade leader's leadership, our people 
cherished deep in their hearts the notion that he is the 
people's great leader [yongdoja] who sets directions in history 
and who decides our destiny and that he is also a banner of 
invincibility who guarantees the victory of our revolution and 
socialism and the future of the nation. 
  The thought that without General Kim Chong-il, neither we 
nor the fatherland exist, and that a system without him is 
meaningless -- like the darkness without the sun -- and the firm 
belief that only when he exists can we keep our dignity and 
happiness and defend the socialist cause, and that only when he 
exists, the earth revolves, history goes on, and mankind can be 
salvaged from disaster; these are our people's real-life 
experiences gained from living in today's history and the 
deepest firm belief of all of us that enabled us to solemnly 
exclaim "We will win only if you are with us" looking up to the 
dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  With such lofty ideological emotion of our people, Comrade 
Yi 
In-mo said to a functionary that there was one thing about his 
experience from the deepest of his heart that he really wanted 
to talk about and expressed his genuine feeling: After I was 
returned to the bosom of the Republic, witnessing the 
fatherland's high spirit and the invincible grandeur of firmly 
defending the country's independence right and the nation's 
dignity resolutely against the imperialists, I felt from head to 
foot that the dear comrade leader is truly a great man. Today, 
Korea must have the dear comrade leader, and if we only have the 
comrade leader, the country shall remain strong and the people 
will always win even if the world disappears. 
  On the revolutionary road to overcome trials, the people 
know 
their leader [yongdoja] and firmly believe in the leader's 
[yongdoja] greatness in the life-or-death experience that 
determines destiny. Our people [passage indistinct] the 
extraordinariness, peerless courage, tested leadership of 
General Kim Chong-il, who smashes all the challenges of history 
to defend our destiny, and trust and follow him with faithful 
loyalty and filial piety. 
  There are leaders [yongdoja] who were respected and loved by 
the people in history, and there are great men praised as 
[passage indistinct] for their braveness and virtue. However, 
there has never been a peerless great man, extraordinary hero, 
and great human being across the ages and countries of the world 
like our dear comrade leader who perfectly and flawlessly 
personified all the qualifications and personalities of a leader 
[yongdoja] at the highest. 
  The dear comrade leader is an outstanding genius in ideology 
and theory, an extraordinary giant general in the art of 
leadership, the utmost reincarnation of faith and will, and a 
great benefactor who bestows benevolence and love. His ideology 
and wisdom is a flame for the joy, sorrow, and life that lifts 
the curtain of the times and lightens the future of mankind, and 
extraordinary wisdom and surprising insight that clearly sees 
through everything and grasps the key for victory in a flash. 
  The art of his leadership is a view of creativity and 
innovation that sees everything from a new point of view and 
gives unique explanations, and skillful cleverness and 
extraordinary sweep that enables him to know the entire country 
as well as he knows his own palms and move all the people as 
one. His faith and will is the faithful loyalty that goes on 
and on along the single road of chuche even if thousands of 
mountains and exploding volcanoes block the way; the boldness 
and stubbornness that always sets out on all work in a big way 
and push it ahead boldly looking down at the world; and the 
invincible fighting spirit and infinite might that carries out 
the work once he made up his mind, even if the sky falls. 
  His love is thousands kinds of love embraced in one bosom 
that gives joy and happiness; the fatherly and comradely love 
that blossoms flowers in snow and storm; and the utmost 
benevolence that would pick up the stars in the sky for the 
people and lay carpets of the most valuable gems for the joy of 
the people. 
  At the time when new political tasks were given to our 
revolutionary march and many challenges and trials were in front 
of us, what did we see from the ideology and leadership of the 
dear comrade leader who presented the slogan "We serve the 
people" and majestically proclaimed the determination and will 
of the Workers' Party of Korea to defend to the end and 
elucidate the popular masses-centered socialism of our style? 
  What did we witness with emotion in the peerless resolution 
and courage of the Supreme Commander General Kim Chong-il, who, 
when the imperialists staged a nuclear war exercise and imposed 
pressure and threat on us by all means in a bid to crush our 
Republic in the past, brilliantly defended the country's 
sovereignty and the nation's dignity by sternly warning that the 
enemies cannot [words indistinct] and that no one can deny our 
dignity? What are we witnessing in the great leadership of the 
dear comrade leader who demonstrated the might of our 
self-reliant economy and unfolded a hopeful blueprint of the 
revolutionary economic strategy despite the imperialists' 
tenacious economic blockade against us and who made this land 
full of the beautiful fragrance of communist human beings when 
the hubbubs of human being's moral corruption and destruction 
were raised everywhere in the world? 
  We have the trust that [passage indistinct] and there is an 
ever-victorious, invincible banner. We have the faith that we 
are always strong and we will always win victory in all fields 
because the greatest commander of the world, who are equipped 
with knowledge and military, is with us. 
  Because General Kim Chong-il is with us we won victory 
yesterday, we are winning victory today, and we will win victory 
tomorrow. 
  History advances along its own track, and we firmly believe 
the final victory of our socialist cause. There always exists 
the great commander and the excellent leader [chidoja] at the 
head of our revolution. We have firmly grasped the philosophy of 
great victory, which is the truth of invincible revolution of 
our times when we are always victorious. General Kim Chong-il! 
His disposition is always strong and ever-victorious. His bold 
courage is precisely the will of an unrivaled general. With this 
bold courage, history advances in this world, and with this will 
the people are advancing along [word indistinct]. 
  General Kim Chong-il's ideology and wisdom are the supreme 
ideology and wisdom of mankind; General Kim Chong-il's politics 
of benevolence are the best in this world; and his firm faith, 
will, courage, and leadership ability are matchless. 
  The people firmly believe that even though all sorts of 
adversities and chaos shake people's minds, we can live better 
off and can win victory only if General Kim chong-il is with us 
and only if we follow him. The road of the revolution is far and 
rough and difficult. There may be trials and adversities on the 
road of the revolution. 
  We who have directly confronted the imperialists should have 
the firm determination to break through more serious trials and 
difficulties in the future. We have nothing to fear. Korea is 
upholding the matchless great commander as invincible and no 
force can block the historic advance toward socialism. 
  Imperialism will be ruined without fail, and socialism will 
win victory without fail. This is the rule of history. Justice 
and victory are with us, and [word indistinct] and doom are with 
imperialism. No force can break the single-hearted unity of our 
party, Army, and people around General Kim Chong-il in this 
world. 
  Let us advance toward victory, following General Kim 
Chong-il, ever-victorious and iron-willed general. 
  We will win only if you, General Kim Chong-il, are with us. 
This is the eternal faith of our people.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 18 (KCNA) -- A national meeting 
was held at the February 8 House of Culture here today to mark 
the lapse of 20 years since the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il 
proclaimed the programme of modelling the whole society on the

  A portrait of the great leader President Kim Il-song and a

  Ho Chong-man, chief vice-chairman of the Central Standing 
Committee of the General Association of Korean Residents in 
Japan (Chongnyon), and Koreans from overseas, staying in the

  A report was delivered at the meeting by Yang Hyong-sop, 
alternate Politburo member of the C.C., WPK and chairman of the 
Supreme People's Assembly.

a deep penetration into the public sentiment of the times for

Il-song as the guiding idea and building socialism and communism 
under its banner and into the requirement of the development of 
the Korean revolution, published a historical work on modelling 
the whole society on the chuche idea on February 19, 1974, 
thereby giving perfect answers to the questions raised by the 
times and the revolution as urgent tasks. 
  He said it is an immortal and distinguished feat performed 
by 
the dear leader for the times and the revolution that he 
provided an invincible, mighty ideological and theoretical 
weapon surely guaranteeing the victory of the revolutionary 
cause of the working class, the cause of socialism and communism 
by profoundly expounding and systematizing in an integral way 
the historical position and characteristic features of the

<F P=106> ["Papers Call for Accomplishing Socialist Cause Under Banner </F>
of Modelling Whole Society on Chuche Idea" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 19 (KCNA) -- Papers here today 
dedicate editorials to the 20th anniversary of the proclamation 
of the programme of modelling the whole society on the chuche 
idea. 
  NODONG SINMUN says that the proclamation of the programme by 
the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il 20 years ago was a 
historical event which opened the road of a revolutionary turn 
in the building of the Workers' Party of Korea and in the 
struggle of the popular masses for socialism. 
  The paper quotes the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song as 
saying: 
  "Our revolution has greeted a new upsurge under the guidance 
of Comrade Kim Chong-il. It was since the start of his guidance 
that a new turn began to take place not only in the party work 
but also in the work of the political, economic and cultural 
domains and great innovations and upsurge have been effected in 
all the fields of socialist construction." 
  The paper says: 
  The 20 years since the proclamation of the programme of 
modelling the whole society on the chuche idea have been decades 
of gigantic creation and construction in which all the spheres 
of social life have been thoroughly transformed our own way, 
with a tight grasp on the idea and theory of the dear leader as 
the lifeline of the Korean revolution, decades of a proud 
struggle and victory in resolutely defending and glorifying 
socialism, determinedly smashing all challenges and obstructions 
of the imperialists and the reactionaries. 
  In the course of the efforts to implement this programme, 
our 
party's revolutionary line of independence, self-sustenance and 
self-reliance in defence has been strictly applied in all 
domains of the state activities and social life and Korean-style 
socialism has been strengthened and developed into the most 
solid and viable socialism remaining unshaken in any storm. 
  And it must be noted that in the struggle to imbue the whole 
army with the chuche idea, the Korean People's Army has been 
built up into combat ranks of a-match-for-a-hundred soldiers 
ready to devote their youth and lives for the party and the 
leader, into invincible army equipped with modern means of 
attack and defence of our style. This is a proud success defying 
comparison. 
  The Korean people have been able to effect changes of the 
century in all sectors of the revolution and construction under 
the slogan of modelling the whole society on the chuche idea and 
they owe all this to the wise guidance of the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  All the party members and other working people should hegard 
it as their first and foremost task to arm themselves firmly 
with the idea and theories of the dear leader, the basis of our 
singlehearted unity, and should resolutely defend and glorify 
the leadership exploits of our party through the application of 
the chuche idea. 
  MINJU CHOSON calls upon all the officials and working people 
to increase the might of our motherland in every way and carry 
to accomplishment the revolutionary cause of chuche started in 
the secret forest of Paektu by more resolutely fighting in 
singlehearted unity around the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, 
deeply cherishing the great national honour and happiness in 
living and making revolution under the leadership of the 
illustrious leader.

  [Excerpt] Yangon [Rangoon], 21 Feb. (OANA-ANTARA) -- 
Indonesia in its capacity as chairman of the Nonaligned Movement 
wants to ask Myanmar [Burma] to play an active role in regional 
and international activities, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said 
here Sunday. 
  Alatas who arrived here Sunday evening for a three-day 
official visit said in the current world changing situation, 
Indonesia hoped that Myanmar would be ready to to take part in 
the development of various cooperation programs either in term 
of the North-South or the South-South cooperation. 
  The minister is on a visit in Myanmar to hold talks with his 
Myanmarese counterpart U Ohn Gyaw on international, regional, 
and bilateral issues after a three-day tour of Laos. 
  Indonesia also hoped that Jakarta and Yangoon ties would 
further be enhanced and stepped up by increasing concrete 
economic cooperation, Alatas said. 
  He said that after Myanmar succeeded in overcomcng its 
internal problems, Indonesia wanted to ask Yangon to play an 
active role in various regional activities which would 
eventually lead it to return to its Southeast Asian membership. 
"For this purpose, we want to see what we can do as Indonesia 
has good traditional relations with Myanmar," Alatas said. He 
said that the latest developments in Myanmar indicated that this 
country had begun to approach its neighbouring Southeast Asian 
countries. "These developments are positive and need to be 
hailed," the minister said. 
  On bilateral ties, the minister said that both nations 
needed 
to fill in their ties with more concrete things. So far, the two 
nations have filled in their relations with cooperation far 
below their common potentials, particularly economic and trade 
potentials, Alatas said. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The Burmese Government has given Thai timber 
merchants until next month to haul 4,777 fallen logs out of 
Burma before it closes its forests, a source says. The source 
said that 47 Thai timber merchants have concessions in Burma but 
the Rangoon government decided last December to end them in a 
bid to save natural resources. 
  The Thais have been hauling logs out but some fallen logs 
remain in the concession areas and it may not be possible to 
remove them by the deadline. The source added that Thai timber 
concession holders have submitted their proposals to remove the 
fallen logs, but the Burmese government is still considering 
them. [passage omitted] 
  The Foreign Affairs Ministry source said that Burma's State 
Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), in consultation with 
several ministries, has outlined the following policies on the 
timber trade: 
  -- The government will extend timber trading until March for 
the fallen 4,777 logs as an exception in the Maw area within the 
Northeastern military command; 
  -- The Forestry Ministry will exclusively carry out timber 
trade. The Forestry Department will report transactions to the 
government for which the forestry ministry will draw up a yearly 
reverse sales plan, decreasing sales by 50 percent, 25 percent 
and 10 percent respectively; 
  -- The Forestry Ministry will also oversee all timber 
production within Burma, shutting out local and foreign private 
enterprises; 
  -- Internal timber trading and will be done on tender 
basis [as published]; 
  -- Cooperatives and private enterprises will not be 
allowed to export timber but will be allowed to process and 
export wood products; 
  -- People holding stakes in joint ventures will also be 
able to buy timber under a tender system based on current prices 
abroad; 
  -- The military will not be allowed to deal in timber 
trading; 
  -- Cooperatives and private enterprises will be encouraged 
to produce processed wood for export.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with U Sein Win, prime minister of the </F>
National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma, by Daw Tin 
Htar Swe of the BBC Burmese Section on the morning of 18 
February; place not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Swe] How does the National Coalition 
Government of the Union of Burma [NCGUB] view the Congressman 
[Bill Richardson] meeting with SLORC [State Law and Order 
Restoration Council] leaders and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi? 
  [Win] We joyously welcome the meeting between Congressman 
Bill Richardson and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. The meeting enabled 
Daw Aung San Suu Kyi to openly express her position not only to 
the Burmese people, but also to the whole world; and we hope it 
is the beginning of the resolution of various problems in Burma. 
[passage omitted] What we are talking about is our hope because 
things will work out only when the SLORC, all the democratic 
forces -- including the democratic forces led by Daw Aung San 
Suu Kyi -- and the national leaders meet and seriously discuss 
problems. Otherwise, there will be no comprehensive solution to 
the problems in Burma. We believe in this, and our hope is 
based on our belief. 
  [Swe] It is true that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi once mentioned 
that national reconciliation is very crucial and she is ready to 
discuss the restoration of national reconciliation with the 
SLORC; but she has been out of touch with the outside world for 
a long time. And now the SLORC has even arranged cease-fires 
with small rebel groups. It is also planning to draw up a 
constitution and is laying down principles for it which will bar 
Daw Aung San Suu Kyi from a leading role in Burmese politics. 
Its relations with ASEAN are also improving. Therefore, the 
question is: who will benefit from the meeting between the SLORC 
and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi? The SLORC or democratic forces? 
  [Win] As far as we are concerned, although it is holding 
talks with the national ethnic groups, the SLORC has not reached 
any agreements. It has not signed any agreements officially. 
These are just discussions. We believe that political matters 
must be included in the discussions. We also believe that, if 
the discussions concentrate only on the cease-fire, without the 
inclusion of political matters, then the discussions will not be 
fruitful and will not last very long. Similarly, laying down 
principles to ensure the Defense Services' leading role in the 
politics and exclude Daw Aung San Suu Kyi from Burmese politics 
at the National Convention will not get approval if people do 
not accept them. It doesn't matter whether it is the 
constitution or not. The constitution, which is not accepted by 
the people, will not last long. We also believe that the SLORC 
should think about this. 
  [Swe] Following the meeting between Mr. Bill Richardson and 
Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, it has been learned that Japan is 
considering providing small-scale aid to Burma, not as a loan 
but as a small-scale financial aid. This news came almost at 
the same time as Mr. Bill Richardson's visit to Burma. Why does 
Japan have to announce its plan to provide aid to Burma at this 
particular time? What is your view, U Sein Win? 
  [Win] We are still studying this. Why is Japan helping 
Burma? We have just learnt that it will provide something like 
a grant to Burma. If we have to express a position, we think it 
is premature. We believe Japan's move to provide aid to Burma 
is premature if it has only taken Bill Richardson's visit to 
Burma and improvements in other areas in Burma as positive steps 
into consideration. 
  [Swe] During the last couple days, while Mr. Richardson was 
in Burma, the SLORC extended Daw Aung San Suu Kyi house arrest 
another year. What do you think about this? 
  [Win] We believe that the SLORC has no honesty. The SLORC 
used Mr. Richardson's visit to improve its international image 
and, at the same time, extended her house arrest. The SLORC has 
no right to extend the house arrest. According to the SLORC's 
laws it cannot be extended. As long as the SLORC continues to 
do contradictory things -- breaching its own law and at the same 
time talking about the rule of law prevailing -- we will have 
difficulties believing the SLORC. Having these doubts, we 
believe that it will be very difficult to establish and restore 
national conciliation.

<F P=106> [Article: "Burma Student Front: Slorc Must Conduct Genuine </F>
Peace Talks" -- first paragraph is THE SUNDAY POST introduction] 
  [Excerpts] The Central Leading Committee of the All Burma 
Students' Democratic Front presents its perspectives of how 
peace negotiations should be conducted if the State Law and 
Order Restoration Council is truly sincere. 
  It is noteworthy that both internal and international 
disputes have been solved through peaceful negotiations, and the 
world is on the road to peace. Various methods have been 
applied for the resolution of seemingly insurmountable disputes 
such as apartheid in South Africa, the PLO and Israel, and the 
Cambodian civil war. The All Burma Students' Democratic Front 
(ABSDF) warmly welcomes all these achievements. 
  If a comparison has to be made between these international 
problems and the Burmese crisis, we sadly discover that the 
former were negotiated in a freer atmosphere than the latter -- 
the most significant point being that bilateral views can be 
expressed and exchanged freely under the watchful eye of 
international observers. 
  In the case of Burma, let alone allowing these 
internationally-accepted norms, Slorc (the State Law and Order 
Restoration Council, which rules Burma) has not created an 
atmosphere of hope or sincerity, not to mention a spirit of 
compromise. Instead, it has set unwritten conditions, such as 
the venue must be in their controlled areas, etc. 
  The ABSDF has always accepted the peaceful solution of 
political problems through political means. However, there must 
be: 
  -- A broad-based discussion on the current political 
problems 
  -- The creation of a harmonious atmosphere, and 
  -- The presence of international observers. 
  Slorc has deliberately ignored such conditions, without 
which 
chances of the talks' success are slim. 
  If we were to examine Slorc's overtures there is practically 
no chance of addressing the most important aspect -- the 
political problem -- which is the crux of the conflict, the 
ulterior motive being that it will be discussed only at Slorc's 
orchestrated National Convention. 
  At its talks with the Kachin Independence Organisation 
(KIO), 
it repeated that unconditional surrender is the only way to 
political discussions. 
  By insisting that this is an internal problem and talks 
could 
be held only inside the country, choosing insignificant towns 
instead of cities, clearly shows that it wants only its own 
version to be known. At the same time, it will restrict the 
movement of any negotiating party to prevent contact with the 
populace. [passage omitted] 
  Despite their loud rhetoric, it is evident that Slorc is 
not heading towards a multi-party democracy. Instead, it is: 
  -- Curbing fundamental freedoms, 
  -- Liquidating some political parties and adopting 
multifarious methods to maim others, and 
  -- Preventing people from participating freely in the 
political process. 
  The farcical National Convention aims to legalise the 
leading 
role of the Burmese army. Among other signs that the military 
has no intention of giving up power are: 
  -- Nullification of the 1990 general election, which was a 
manifestation of the people's desire for democracy. 
  -- Expansion of repressive measures, which continues 
unabated. 
  -- Monopolisation of the economy through both long- and 
short-term projects. 
  -- Expansion of the armed forces and purchase of huge 
amounts of weapons. 
  As the agenda for peace, all repressive measures must be 
revoked or abolished, such as martial law, extrajudicial 
killings, kangaroo courts, torture, concentration and 
interrogation camps, the secret Military Intelligence Service. 
  All political prisoners and prisoners of conscience must be 
released, and forced labour and forced eviction must be stopped. 
  Human rights must be protected and personal security 
guaranteed. Press freedom, freedom of assembly and freedom of 
expression must also be allowed, so as the rights of the workers 
and freedom in agronomy. 
  The military mechanism has to go. This means Slorc must 
reduce the number of the combat forces and prevent further coups 
d'etat from taking place. Further, it is imperative that the 
army be subordinated to a civilian government. 
  In regards to the ethnic minorities, equality and 
self-determination for them must be guaranteed. The right for 
them to freely participate in the political process is a must. 
Also, measures to promote the cultures and improve the living 
standards of ethnic peoples has to be implemented. 
  Compensation must be paid for losses caused by atrocities 
and 
civil war. Destroyed villages must be reconstructed, 
forcibly-evicted villagers must be relocated to their original 
homes, violators of human rights must be brought to justice, and 
rehabilitation programmes for refugees must be set up. 
  And finally, Slorc must transfer power to the duly-elected 
people's representatives. 
  ABSDF's perspective on the ongoing negotiations between 
ethnic groups and Slorc is that it understands and sympathises 
with the difficult situation of the ethnic nationalities which 
have forced them to enter into the peace talks. The ABSDF 
regards them as allies until final victory. 
  The ABSDF urges the nationalities: 
  -- To consider the whole national issues, 
  -- Not to confine themselves to bilateral economic issues 
but to highlight democracy and their rights, 
  -- To adhere to DAB policies, and 
  -- To strive for the unity of democratic forces and ethnic 
nationalities. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In the Malaysian state of Sabah, the ruling Parti 
Bersatu Sabah [Sabah United Party], PBS, has won the state 
elections. It won 25 of the 48 state assembly seats contested 
to retain the reign of government in the state. It got the 
simple majority after the results of 44 seats were declared at 
1030 PM [1430 GMT] last night. Newspapers described the PBS's 
victory as a slim one, as it defeated the Barisan Nasional 
[National Front] by only two seats. 
  Reports from Kota Kinabalu this morning said the swearing in 
of the new Sabah State Government before the governor, Tun 
Mohamed Said Keruak, was scheduled to be held at 0830 this 
morning. 
  Meanwhile, in a press conference in Kuala Lumpur this 
morning, Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said he 
has been informed that many of the PBS state assemblymen have 
been held in confinement for fear that they would cross over to 
Barisan Nasional. He said Barisan Nasional has received the 
messages that some PBS state assemblymen have expressed their 
intention to join Barisan Nasional. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said 
he was prepared to receive them.

  [Excerpts] KOTA KINABALU, Malaysia Feb 20 (AFP) -- Sabah's 
Catholic Chief Minister Joseph Pairin Kitingan, elected to 
another term, was unable to take his oath of office Sunday 
because he was locked out of the governor's mansion. [passage 
omitted] 
  The independent federal Elections Commission later declared 
the PBS the winner with 25 of the 48 seats in the state 
legislature, after a bruising campaign. The remaining 23 seats 
went to the National Front of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed, 
who had vowed to hound Kitingan out of office for deserting the 
federal coalition on the eve of parliamentary elections fours 
ago. 
  In Kuala Lumpur, Mahathir accused Kitingan of "unlawfully 
locking up" PBS legislators who wanted to switch their 
allegiance to the National Front. "The PBS should allow them to 
decide. Give them the freedom to move," he said. Mahathir also 
said that his National Front would not form a coalition with 
Kitingan, adding "There is no stalemate. It is up to the 
governor to decide" (who to swear in). 
  Kitingan told reporters early Sunday after that the 
governor's aides had told him through the locked gates that the 
governor was too sick to receive him. He accused the National 
Front of using money -- some "dropped by helicopter" -- to buy 
votes. 
  He also claimed that large numbers of Filipino and 
Indonesian 
immigrants were intimidated into voting for the federal 
coalition to avoid expulsion. "The elections were not fair," he 
said. The lock out was a virtual replay of Kitingan's first 
stunning election victory in 1985, when he was also refused 
entry into the then-governor's residence, and Muslim leader 
Mustapha Harun was sworn in as chief minister. 
  This time, the 76-year-old Mustapha, frail and ailing, 
briefly joined Kitingan outside the governor's residence on 
Saturday and again on Sunday in a show of support for his 
one-time Christian enemy. 
  Kitingan said he feared his elected assemblymen might buckle 
under pressure and defect. "We have heard that there may be 
some attempt to get our people to go to the other side," he said. 
  The election outcome showed a marked swing away from the PBS 
among Muslim and ethnic Chinese voters although Kitingan 
performed well in his traditional, mostly Christian, 
strongholds. Those areas are dominated by the Kadazans, the 
largest of several indigenous groups. 
  Mahathir had warned Sabah's almost 600,000 voters that a PBS 
victory could bring racial and religious strife between 
Christians and Muslims. He said the PBS had fanned racial, 
religious and parochial sentiment in the run up to the polls. 
"Does the PBS want to turn this country into a 
Bosnia-Herzegovina or Northern Ireland or Kashmir?" he said in a 
statement released Thursday. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia Feb. 21 (OANA-BERNAMA) 
-- Parti Bersatu Sabah [Sabah United Party] (PBS) President 
Joseph Pairin Kitingan whose party won the just ended state 
election with the narrowest margin possible was sworn in as 
chief minister of the East Malaysian state of Sabah Monday. 
  He took his oath of office before the yang dipertua negeri 
(governor), Mohamed Said Keruak, at 10.05 am local time. 
  Pairin had stationed himself by the istana [palace] gates 
since 9.40 pm on Saturday soon after his party won a simple 
majority, to stop any other person to be sworn in as head of 
state government. His action was to prevent a recurrence what is 
now known in local political circles as the 1985 incident. 
[passage omitted] Eight PBS winning candidates were sworn in as 
state cabinet members after Pairin took his oath of office. They 
are Bernard Dompok (Moyog), Amirkahar Mustapha (Banggi), Chau 
Tet Onn (Api-api), Joseph Kurup (Sook), Wilfred Bumburing 
(Tamparuli), Lajim Ukin (Klias), Lau Pui Keong (Karamunting), 
and Adib Sigoh (Nabawan). Dompok, Amirkahar, and Chau were 
appointed deputy chief ministers. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] KOTA KINABALU, Malaysia, Feb 22 (AFP) -- As the 
dust settles on possibly the dirtiest election in Sabah history, 
Chief Minister Joseph Pairin Kitingan faces the uphill task of 
repairing ties with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, analysts 
said Tuesday. 
  "He has survived for now but the real battle is only 
starting," said an aide to Kitingan, the embattled Catholic 
politician who beat Mahathir's Muslim-dominated National Front 
by a narrow two-seat margin in weekend polls to elect 48 members 
to the state assembly. 
  Kitingan made his first move toward a reconciliation with 
Mahathir on Monday, immediately after Governor Mohamed Said 
Keruak swore him into office after a humiliating 36-hour wait 
outside the bolted gates of the governor's mansion. "I hope 
things go smoothly. It's time to sit down and look ahead," he 
said, although supporters who kept a vigil outside the mansion 
for fear Kitingan would be denied office seemed less willing to 
overlook the indignity suffered by their leader. But the chief 
minister said threats made in the heat of an election campaign 
should not set the tone for the long-term relationship between 
his state and the federal government. 
  "Now that the election is over, there must be communication 
channels and sensibility," said Kitingan, who said Monday he 
would seek a meeting with Mahathir to improve federal-state 
ties. [passage omitted] 
  Sakaran Dandai, Sabah head of Mahathir's United Malays 
National Organisation (UMNO), the largest component in the 
National Front, said however that Kitingan's government cannot 
survive. "Several assemblymen have expressed interest in joining 
the National Front," said Sakaran, a federal minister. 
  Kitingan could also face a legal challenge to his right 
under 
the state constitution to appoint six members to the state 
assembly to fortify his position. "The provision may be in 
conflict with the federal constitution," according to federal 
Law Minister Hamid Albar.

  [Text] Defense Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak has ruled 
out the possibility of making public the copy of the memorandum 
of understanding, MOU, on an arms deal which Malaysia signed 
with Britain in 1988. He said the copy of the MOU is a 
government document classified as a secret as it involves 
national security. As such, it could not be made public. He 
said this in an interview with BERNAMA in Singapore today. 
Datuk Sri Najib was asked to comment on a report that the 
Malaysian parliamentary panel headed by opposition leader Lim 
Kit Siang was seeking a copy of the bilateral defense agreement 
following British media allegations of an arms-for-aid deal 
involving the Pergau Dam. 
  Datuk Sri Najib said the issue was touched on when he met 
the British parliamentary undersecretary of state for defense, 
(Lord Clampton) who called on him at his hotel suite. He said 
they agreed that there was no linkage between the Pergau Dam 
project deal and the MOU. Datuk Sri Najib and (Lord Clampton) 
are in Singapore to attend the Asian Aerospace 1994 Air Show. 
Datuk Sri Najib said the DAP [Democratic Action Party] was 
making the arms deal an issue just as it would have on any other 
matter.

  [Text] The Malaysian economy recorded a strong growth of 
8.1 percent in its real gross domestic product, GDP, during the 
third quarter of 1993 against 10.1 percent in the preceding 
quarter. The strong growth was attributed mainly to the 
manufacturing and construction sectors with each sector 
registering a double-digit growth of 12.5 percent. The Central 
Bank, in its third quarter economic review, said that activities 
in the services sector were equally buoyant maintaining a growth 
of 9.6 percent, while the agriculture sector slowed down to 2 
percent and the mining sector remained negative 0.8 percent. 
The continued buoyancy of the manufacturing sector reflected 
favorably growths of the export-oriented as well as domestic 
market-oriented industries. All the export-oriented industries 
recorded strong growths, especially the textile and wearing 
apparel industry, electronics and electrical product industries, 
and wood products.

  [Excerpt] Jakarta, Feb 22 (ANTARA) -- Thousands of students 
from Jakarta and Bandung staged a demonstration in front of the 
US Embassy here Tuesday, on the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue and the 
recent drug trafficking involving two staff members of the 
embassy. 
  "We insist that the US Government apologize over the 
involvement of its diplomatic staff in illegal-drug dealing," 
said the protesters, calling themselves the Salvation Front for 
Indonesia's Youth Generation (FPGMI). They also accused the US 
Government for influencing Indonesian youths with its 
"destructive culture", being unfair towards the Islamic world 
and forcing its interest on others. 
  "The inconsistencies of the US in upholding justice and 
truth 
are reflected in its double-standard policy toward Islamic 
world," they claimed. 
  The demonstrators interspersed anti-American chants with 
shoutings of "God is great" and sang a march. "US Embassy: We 
sell xtc (ecstasy), narcotics and morphine", "USA satellite of 
Zionism" and "Nato and USA are cowards, not heroes," said the 
banner and poster totting crowd. 
  Two protesters then delivered a copy of their statement to 
an 
embassy staff, while the others peacefully and voluntarily 
dispersed before the police could make any moves to end the 
demonstration, which occurred in less than an hour. In the 
statement, the demonstrators demanded that the US Government 
honor and respect Indonesia's law and sovereignty by not abusing 
their priviledges. 
  They also insisted that the US act honestly and fairly 
towards the Islamic world as well as refrain from using trade 
and economic issues for their own interests. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Central Executive Council of the All Indonesian 
Workers Union [SPSI] has welcomed the U.S. decision to postpone 
a review of the Generalized System of Preferences [GSP] 
privilege for Indonesia because this will make it easier for 
Indonesia to prove that it is improving worker welfare. SPSI 
Secretary General Bomer Pasaribu said this in Jakarta yesterday 
in response to the U.S. decision to postpone the review of the 
GSP privilege for Indonesia from 15 February to September 1994. 
Bomer Pasaribu said Indonesia is redoubling efforts to enhance 
worker rights such as the rights of union and negotiations and 
increases in minimum wages and social benefits. 
  Earlier, Manpower Minister Abdul Latief said the U.S. 
Government decided to postpone the review of GSP privilege 
because it will discuss the GSP law in September. Thus, the 
Indonesian Government highly appreciates the U.S. Government's 
decision to postpone the review of U.S. 643 million worth of the 
GSP privilege for Indonesia.

  [Text] The Indonesian Government today welcomed North 
Korea's decision to accept inspections of its nuclear 
installations by the International Atomic Energy Agency. A 
Foreign Affairs Department statement released today said 
Indonesia hopes that this positive development will reduce the 
tension on the Korean Peninsula, which has recently been quite 
worrying. The statement also said that the comprehensive 
settlement of this issue will prevent a prolonged political 
crisis in East Asia and disturbances to the region's security. 
  Indonesia, as the chairman of the Nonaligned Movement, has 
noted the positive response from the international community, 
especially from countries in the East Asia region, and the 
remarks from other nations that this new development will open 
the door for negotiations between the United States and North 
Korea over the nuclear issue.

  [Excerpt] Vientiane, February 21 (KPL) -- The visit to the 
Lao PDR [People's Democratic Republic] by Mr. Ali Alatas, who is 
the first Indonesian foreign minister to pay an official visit 
to the country since the two countries established their 
diplomatic relations in 1957, is of historic significance for 
these two countries to strengthen their relationship and develop 
their cooperation to economic field. 
  Foreign Minister Somsavat Lengsavat said this in a joint 
interview held before the departure of the visiting Indonesian 
foreign minister and his delegation yesterday morning. 
  In the joint interview, Mr. Ali Alatas said that the aim of 
their visit at the time was to discuss with the Lao side about 
seeking ways to deepen the Lao-Indonesian good relations leading 
to economic cooperation. The Indonesian foreign minister 
expressed his satisfaction that he had an opportunity to work 
and discuss with Mr. Somsavat Lengsavat and to visit President 
Nouhak Phoumsavan and other Lao leaders. He said this will 
enable both sides to see a deeper mutual understanding with 
their better cooperation. 
  Mr. Ali Alatas also voiced hope that Indonesia and Laos will 
sign an agreement on economic and technical cooperation when the 
Lao foreign minister is visiting Indonesia in the near future at 
his invitation because Laos and Indonesia have been coordinating 
and cooperating in various activities, especially in the 
settlement of the Cambodian issue. 
  The Indonesian foreign minister pointed out the position of 
Indonesia to international issues and those in Southeast Asia. 
As Indonesia is holding the chairmanship of the Nonaligned 
Movement, he indicated the stand and policy of the movement on 
such issues as South-South relations, North-South relations, and 
the activities of the movement within the UN framework. [passage

  [Excerpts] A high-ranking official of the Department of 
Foreign Affairs yesterday proposed the "internationalization" of 
the territorial disputes in the South China Sea through the 
intervention of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
(ASEAN) and the United Nations to prevent several countries from 
asserting their claims through the use of force. 
  Discarding previous proposals of confining the problem 
within 
the East Asian region, Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Rodolfo 
Severino said that injecting a "degree of internationalization" 
to the South China Sea issue will help lead to a more enduring 
and binding solution to the conflicting claims. 
  Severino presented this proposal during the third 
international workshop on ASEAN-UN cooperation in Peace and 
Preventive Diplomacy in Bangkok, Thailand. The Department of 
Foreign Affairs released copies of his briefing paper to the 
media. [passage omitted] 
  Despite the potential of armed conflict erupting in the 
region due to the disputes, there are no existing mechanisms 
readily available to prevent this scenario, or any concrete 
proposals to resolve the problem peacefully, Severino noted. 
  Severino explained that, ensuring the close cooperation of 
the ASEAN and the UN in peacefully resolving the brewing 
conflict will squelch fears that internationalizing the issue 
will only complicate it and lead to interference by "outside 
powers" who have no direct interests in the problem within the 
South China Sea. "On the other hand, one could argue that some 
degree of internationalization could be a form of preventive 
diplomacy," Severino said. "Focusing the international 
spotlight on a volatile, albeit regional problem, can 
effectively restrain states from resorting to the threat or use 
of armed force." 
  He added that bringing the issue to the United Nations will 
help ensure that any aggressor in the region will be held 
accountable "and will have to face the political consequences of 
his act." 
  Severino said that instead of waiting for the problem to 
erupt into a full-blown conflict, the ASEAN and UN should start 
working hand in hand as soon as possible to prevent any 
instability in the East Asian region. 
  Severino said that involving the ASEAN in the settlement of 
the claims in the South China Sea will limit international 
participation to the positive gains under this proposal.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 21 KYODO -- Chances are slim that 
Japan and the United States will reach consensus on the 
definition of "objective criteria" as a means to gauge foreign 
access to Japan's markets, a senior Foreign Ministry official 
said Monday [21 February]. 
  "Frankly speaking, an early breakthrough on the issue is 
unlikely, " Deputy Foreign Minister Koichiro Matsuura, a chief 
negotiator in the Japan-U.S. trade framework talks, said in a 
speech sponsored by the Japan National Press Club. 
  Terming solution of the issue "very difficult," Matsuura 
proposed holding informal sessions between the two countries. 
  Bilateral negotiations on a governmental basis are limited 
following the collapse of the framework talks during the 
Japan-U.S. summit earlier this month, he said. 
  As part of efforts to mend the soured economic relations 
with 
Washington, Matsuura cited the need for Japan to cut its global 
current-account surplus "significantly" within four to five 
years, in line with the Japan-U.S. accord last July. 
  As a first step, Tokyo should achieve its economic target 
for 
fiscal 1994 of cutting the ratio of the global current-account 
surplus against gross domestic product to 2.8 percent from about 
3.1 percent estimated for the current year, he said. 
  Achieving that figure would lead to a reduction in Japan's 
trade surplus with the U.S., which accounted for more than half 
of its global surplus of nearly 120 billion dollars in calendar 
1993, Matsuura said. 
  He said the state of the U.S. trade balance with Japan is 
like "a thermometer gauging U.S. harshness against Tokyo." 
  Matsuura called for U.S. efforts to reduce its budget 
deficit, expand savings and increase industrial competitiveness, 
in line with its commitments shown in the July 1993 meeting 
between then Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton. 
  Matsuura criticized the U.S. for threatening to scrap a 
global trade accord proposal on electronic components. 
  Washington recently unveiled a plan to retract a 60 percent 
to 70 percent cut in tariffs on electronic parts as agreed under 
the Uruguay Round of multilateral talks sponsored by the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  The U.S. said it will opt for the step because Japan has 
rejected a U.S. call for removal of wood product tariffs in 
Japan. Tokyo agreed in the Uruguay Round to halve the tariffs. 
  The latest U.S. action is "unconvincing" in terms of the 
procedure of the global trade talks, Matsuura said. 
  The concluded Uruguay Round allowed for additional offers by 
GATT member countries before February 15 only when such offers 
are regarded as steps leading to further market opening, 
Matsuura said. 
  On the overall Japan-U.S. relations, Matsuura said the two 
countries should do their utmost to prevent the current economic 
friction from impinging on other aspects like political problems. 
  It would reflect a "relationship of grown-ups" if the matter 
is handled at an economic level and prevented from worsening the 
overall relations of the two countries, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 21 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa expressed resolve Monday [21 February] to work out a 
fresh package of market-opening measures as early as possible, 
government officials said. 
  Hosokawa told a meeting of leaders of the government and 
ruling parties that Japan urgently needs to adopt market-opening 
measures to resolve the trade row with the United States. 
  Meanwhile, a government source said, "we want to produce a 
concluded package at the earliest possible date in March." 
  The Hosokawa cabinet decided last week to formulate a set of 
measures including deregulation and import promotion to improve 
foreign access to the Japanese market. 
  The decision followed a U.S. announcement that it plans to 
impose sanctions on imports of Japanese cellular phones. 
  The government source said, however, that the planned 
market- 
opening steps are not designed to avert threatened U.S. trade 
retaliation but are "voluntary efforts." 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a morning 
press conference that the government will hold a 
ministerial-level emergency meeting "within this week" to 
discuss ways to repair strained trade ties with the U.S. 
  Ministers of foreign affairs, finance, and international 
trade and industry will attend the session, which is likely to 
be held after the third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 
becomes law, probably Wednesday, government sources said. 
  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata told the ruling parties' 
meeting that the focal point now is how Japan and the U.S. can 
strike a deal on criteria without using figures to measure the 
openness of Japanese markets. 
  Hosokawa met U.S. President Bill Clinton earlier this month 
in Washington but failed to agree on a new framework to slash 
Japan's huge surplus in bilateral trade, which last year 
amounted to about 60 billion dollars, according to U.S. figures. 
  The U.S. asked Japan to set numerical targets but Japan 
rejected the demand, saying it would lead to managed trade.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- Japan cannot make reducing 
its current account surplus into a trade target with the United 
States, the country's economic planning chief said Tuesday [22 
February]. 
  Manae Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning 
Agency (EPA), told a regular press conference that official 
predictions of cutting the huge surplus as a proportion of gross 
domestic product (GDP) provide a reference figure but cannot be 
construed as a trade target. 
  The agency's prediction that the current account surplus 
will 
fall to 2.8 percent of GDP in the fiscal year starting April, 
from an expected 3.1 percent in the current fiscal year, can be 
an indicator of effort, but "it's impossible to use as a 
precondition" in trade talks, she said. 
  A senior Foreign Ministry official said Monday that 
achieving 
the target for cutting the overall current account surplus is 
important in reducing the black ink with the U.S. as well. 
  The comment by Koichiro Matsuura, deputy foreign minister, 
was interpreted as implicitly accepting the prediction as a 
trade target. 
  But Kubota said the current account, affected by such 
factors 
as exchange rate fluctuations, "is not Japan's problem alone." 
  Kubota, noting that Japan's current account surplus is 
declining in yen terms, said the government should endeavor to 
achieve its recently stated goals of deregulation, promoting 
trade and investment, improving competition through stricter 
antitrust enforcement and simplifying the government procurement 
system. 
  To help achieve those goals, she said, the EPA should 
support 
spurring domestic demand through planned incomes tax cuts and 
increased housing investment and public works spending. 
  The agency should also effectively use its ombudsman's 
office 
to improve foreign access to Japanese trade and investment and 
should form plans to reduce the gap between high domestic prices 
and those overseas, Kubota said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- The government is 
considering expanding the scheduled public works investment in 
the 10 years ending in fiscal 2000 by 100 trillion yen to deal 
with mounting economic friction with the United States, 
government sources said Tuesday [22 February]. 
  Existing plans call for the government to invest 430 
trillion 
yen in public works in the period. 
  The sources said the proposed increase in public works 
spending is intended to appease the U.S. tension has been rising 
between the two countries following the breakdown of the 
bilateral framework trade talks earlier this month. 
  The increased investment would help expand Japan's 
infrastructure, such as national communications networks, 
housing and parks, boost domestic economic demand and cut 
Japan's chronic current-account surplus with the U.S., the 
sources said. 
  In the framework talks, Japan had pledged efforts to sharply 
reduce the surplus in the medium term. 
  The government had earlier said it would announce next month 
a voluntary four-point program for cutting the surplus and 
opening its markets to imports. 
  But that and other programs announced in the past would not 
be enough to satisfy the U.S. Government, the sources said. 
  An advisory panel for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the 
Council for Economic Restructuring, called in December for an 
expansion of the public works investment program, and Hosokawa 
himself told a new year's news conference he agreed with the 
proposal.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- Japan's trade minister 
Hiroshi Kumagai said Tuesday [22 February] a political decision 
by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is necessary to unblock the 
bilateral "framework" trade talks with the United States. 
  Kumagai told a press conference after the regular morning 
cabinet meeting that the stalemate in the negotiations is "an 
issue which cannot be left to bureaucrats and requires a 
political decision." 
  He also reiterated that the government has to decide what 
measures -- both micro- and macro-economic -- it will take and 
when to break the impasse on the talks. 
  The bilateral framework negotiations meant to whittle down 
Japan's lopsided trade surplus with the U.S. broke down earlier 
this month due to a discord over a U.S. demand for quantitative 
targets for Japanese imports. 
  The collapsed talks apparently prompted the U.S. to announce 
plans last week to impose sanctions on Japan over a cellular 
phone dispute. 
  Asked about a U.S. move to withdraw its offer on tariff cuts 
on electronics products made at the completed Uruguay Round of 
trade talks, Kumagai said the U.S. about-face should not be 
"viewed in the context of the Japan-U.S. relations." 
  Washington has threatened to do so unless Japan reduces its 
timber tariffs. 
  He also appeared to be critical of the U.S. move, saying, 
"The Uruguay Round was concluded last December."

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 19 KYODO -- The government will work 
out a plan soon to open Japan's auto parts market to meet U.S. 
demands made in the failed bilateral "framework" trade talks, 
government sources said Saturday [19 February]. 
  Under the plan, licensed mechanics at auto repair shops 
would 
be allowed to overhaul and repair major auto components such as 
driving gear, the sources said. 
  Currently, only government-designated repair shops are 
allowed to service such components. 
  At the same time, auto repair shops would be encouraged to 
use generic auto parts, including imports, to end the trade 
custom of favoring Japanese manufacturer-supplied parts, they 
said. 
  In Japan, 70 to 80 percent of the auto parts are supplied by 
Japanese automakers. 
  The government will also consider sending its own inspectors 
to the United States to expedite inspections on auto imports, 
the sources said. 
  The auto industry has also started figuring out ways to 
boost 
imports and local procurement of auto parts and components, 
industry sources said. 
  Specifically, domestic automakers will draw up their 
respective plans to ensure more stable business deals with U.S. 
parts manufacturers and step up joint development of components 
with them. 
  Moreover, they will study ways of increasing domestic sales 
of imported vehicles, the sources said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- Japan rejected a U.S. call 
to expand its auto imports during the latest trade framework 
talks in Washington, Trade Minister Hiroshi Kumagai disclosed 
Tuesday [22 February]. 
  Washington had urged Japan to promise an annual increase of 
20 percent in its imports of auto components and finished 
automobiles, Kumagai, head of the Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry (MITI), told a House of Representatives 
Budget Committee session. 
  But Tokyo turned down the request because MITI thought such 
a 
promise would be hard to keep, Kumagai said. 
  The February 11 talks between Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton on establishing a new 
trade framework broke down when the two countries failed to 
narrow a gap over the definition of "objective criteria" as a 
means to gauge U.S. access to Japan's markets. 
  Japan is opposed to introducing numerical targets in autos 
and other trade areas as sought by the U.S.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 21 KYODO -- Japan will present to the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) a table of tariff 
cut offers made last December as part of the Uruguay Round pact 
without any changes, a Japanese official said Monday [21 
February]. 
  Hideaki Kumano, vice minister of international trade and 
industry, said the table will be submitted Monday despite a U.S. 
move to withdraw some of its trade concessions. 
  "We will not go back on the content (of tariff cut offers) 
as 
of last December," Kumano told reporters. 
  Kumano's comment came against the backdrop of reports 
quoting 
U.S. trade negotiator John Schmidt as saying Washington was 
withdrawing some tariff offers, including cuts on industrial 
electronics products. 
  Japan's ambassador to GATT Nobutoshi Akao accused the United 
States last week of "betrayal" in pulling back tariff cut offers 
that helped pave the way for the Uruguay Round trade pact. 
  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has denied the 
accusation but Akao says Washington has advised Tokyo that it is 
withdrawing lower customs duties on electronics against the 
agreement reached in December.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 21 KYODO -- Japan will defend its 
recent tax cuts to the United States again at a weekend meeting 
of top financial officials from the Group of Seven (g-7) 
economic powers, Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito said Monday 
[21 February]. 
  Saito told a regular press conference it remains "very 
difficult" to make the U.S. understand that the 6 trillion yen 
worth of tax cuts were not simply a one-time measure, so Japan 
will try again at the G-7 meeting in Frankfurt. 
  He said explanations are especially difficult as Japan 
scrapped Prime Minister Morihiro hosokawa's original plan for a 
permanent income tax cut to be offset three years later by 
replacing the 3 percent consumption tax with a 7 percent 
"national welfare tax." 
  Saito reiterated that ruling coalition leaders agreed to 
enact comprehensive tax reform this year, which is to shift the 
taxation burden away from such direct levies as income taxes and 
toward direct taxation on consumption and the like. 
  Over the weekend, Kosuke Nakahiro, vice finance minister for 
international affairs, tried to explain the tax scheme at a 
deputy- level meeting in Washington to prepare for the G-7 
gathering. 
  The U.S. has criticized Tokyo's recent stimulus measures as 
too little to boost the domestic economy and thus spur imports 
to curb Japan's huge trade surplus. President Bill Clinton has 
specifically cited finance and trade bureaucrats for the failure 
of recent U.S.- Japan trade talks. 
  Although he and his fellow bureaucrats must "reflect" on 
such 
criticism, Saito said that compared to the explicit welfare tax, 
the current plan is not what his ministry wanted. 
  "It's sad and painful," he lamented, adding that he cannot 
understand why the Finance Ministry is perceived as the 
"villain."

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 19 KYODO -- Japan plans to call for a 
stable movement in the currency market at the Group of Seven 
(G-7) industrialized nations' meeting of top finance officials 
to be held in Germany on February 26, financial sources said 
Saturday [19 February]. 
  Japanese officials want to confirm with their G-7 
counterparts an earlier agreement that erratic movements in the 
foreign exchange market are undesirable, and will request their 
cooperation in intervening to prevent such moves, the sources 
said. 
  The upcoming G-7 meeting brings together finance ministers 
and central bankers from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, 
Italy, Japan and the United States. 
  The themes of the G-7 talks will be considered when deputy 
finance ministers of these countries get together in Washington 
on Sunday. 
  The sources said they expect the G-7 discussions to deal 
with, among other things, aid to Russia and policies to 
stabilize the currency market. 
  The Japanese currency rocketed upward against the U.S. 
dollar in the wake of the failure last week between Japanese 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill 
Clinton to reach an agreement on trade talks at their summit 
meeting in Washington. 
  Speculation that the U.S. will strengthen upward pressure on 
the yen, after what in effect was a breakdown of the bilateral 
"framework" trade talks, spurred frantic buying of the yen in 
the currency market. 
  Although the yen has given up some of its gains due to the 
Bank of Japan's dollar-buying, yen-selling market interventions, 
the threat of the Japanese currency jumping up again still 
exists. 
  Japanese officials will likely tell the G-7 finance 
ministers 
that a higher yen has the danger of delaying recovery of Japan's 
economy as it could offset the benefits of the government's 
recently announced 15.25 trillion yen economic package, the 
sources said. 
  The officials will probably assert that not only will a 
strong yen put a brake on the Japanese economy and work against 
efforts to reduce the country's trade surplus, but that it would 
also run counter to the policy of the G-7 countries to strive 
together for a global economic recovery, they said. 
  Japan's assertions may not be easily accepted, however, amid 
the country's rift over trade talks with the U.S. 
  Although Europe supports Japan's stance of refusing U.S. 
demands to set numerical targets to gauge the openness of 
Japanese markets, the breakdown in trade talks has already put 
the Japan-U.S. relationship in a hostile tone. 
  On aid to Russia, the G-7 countries will hear from Russian 
officials the progress of economic reforms in that country, the 
sources said. It will consider whether the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) can offer Russia the second part of their 
financial package started in April last year. 
  In July 1993, Russia received 1.5 billion dollars of the 3 
billion dollar package, but the remainder of the IMF aid has 
been withheld since conditions such as improvement in the 
Russian economic situation have not been met.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 20 KYODO -- Japan asked other 
Group of Seven (G-7) economic powers Sunday [20 February] to 
cooperate to stem a further advance of the yen. 
  The request was made at a meeting of deputy finance 
ministers 
in Washington. 
  Kosuke Nakahira, the Japanese representative at the meeting 
held at the U.S. Treasury Department, told reporters he told his 
G-7 colleagues that volatility in foreign exchange rates is not 
desirable. 
  Nakahira, vice finance minister for international affairs, 
also said he explained the state of the Japanese economy and the 
government's series of actions to pull it out of the prolonged 
recession, including the 15 trillion yen pump-priming package 
unveiled earlier this month. 
  He did not give any indication, however, of whether the 
so-called G-7 deputies reached any agreement on his request. 
  The finance officials met to prepare for next Saturday's 
meeting in Frankfurt of the G-7 finance ministers and central 
bank governors. The G-7 groups Britain, Canada, France, 
Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. 
  The Frankfurt talks were originally expected to be focused 
on 
aid to Russia, but Japan now hopes that the G-7 countries will 
send some signals to the market that they do not desire further 
wild swings in the yen's value. 
  The Japanese currency gained as much as 6 yen at one stage 
in 
last week's trading, propelled by speculation that the collapse 
of Japan-U.S. "Framework" trade talks may prompt the U.S. to 
deliberately guide the yen higher to slim its colossal trade 
deficit with Tokyo.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- Group of Seven (G-7) 
ministers are expected to discuss the recent "artificially 
manipulated" currency rates, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii 
said Tuesday [22 February]. 
  "Artificially manipulated movements are undesirable," Fujii 
said, adding that this would be discussed at a meeting of G-7 
finance ministers and central bankers on Saturday in Germany. 
  Speaking at a regular press briefing after a morning cabinet 
meeting, Fujii was referring to the yen's recent sharp advance 
against the dollar on speculations over U.S. comments tolerating 
the yen's rise. 
  But Fujii said, "I'm not thinking at the moment" of 
requesting a statement over the yen's recent sharp movements. 
  He reiterated that the G-7 ministers would discuss their 
earlier accord to cooperate in keeping stable currency rates 
reflecting economic fundamentals. 
  Considering the tax issue, Fujii said he would try to 
explain 
again to the U.S. side that Japan is to implement a 
"full-fledged" tax reform by the year-end. 
  U.S. officials have said the 6 trillion yen tax cuts limited 
to a single year would not be enough to prop up Japan's domestic 
demand to curb trade imbalance. 
  Fujii repeated that the tax cuts were conducted as an 
"emergency measure" and the ruling coalition leaders have shown 
"a direction for full-fledged" reform by agreeing to set a 
"balanced tax system in income, assets and consumption" by the 
year-end. 
  Meanwhile, he said that discussions are under way over 
boosting a 10-year program of spending 430 trillion yen in 
public works as one option for Japan's market-opening measures. 
  But he stressed that financial sources must be secured, and 
also rejected increasing construction bonds which he noted are 
"better than deficit-covering bonds but are the same in terms of 
national debt." 
  The Finance Ministry estimated in the fiscal 1994 budget 
plan 
that Japan's outstanding balance of government bonds would top 
200 trillion yen.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- Bank of Japan (BOJ) 
governor Yasushi Mieno on Tuesday [22 February] voiced concern 
over the recent surge in the yen's value against the dollar. 
  The Japanese currency's strength against the dollar is 
"excessive," mieno told a private forum. The monetary 
authorities will "take appropriate steps in a timely manner" to 
stabilize exchange rates, he added. 
  He said the recent yen rise is feared to worsen corporate 
sentiment. 
  The yen gathered upward momentum against the dollar 
following 
the breakdown earlier this month of Japan-U.S. trade talks 
designed to establish a framework to help reduce Japan's huge 
trade surplus. 
  Mieno said the Japanese economy is still stagnant but he 
noted that corporate sentiment is showing some slight signs of 
recovery. He said the current short-term interest rates are low 
enough to support corporate restructuring efforts.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- Bank of Japan governor 
Yasushi Mieno vowed "appropriate steps in a timely manner" 
Tuesday [22 February] to stabilize recently gyrating currency 
markets. 
  Four days before meeting finance leaders of the Group of 
Seven industrial nations, Mieno said in a Tokyo speech that the 
recent resurgence of the yen had "clearly gone too far." 
  The yen has eased against the dollar in recent days from 
last 
week's trade woes-prompted jump, with dealers citing apparently 
repeated yen-selling interventions by Japan's central bank. 
  Mieno said that a surging yen could again dampen Japanese 
corporate sentiment, which he said had been showing glimmers of 
improvement since the year began. 
  He said he wants to watch the effect of corporate sentiment 
on economic recovery, but repeated that no clear signs of a 
turnaround are visible. 
  Mieno said the economy remains weak, repeating that 
corporate 
capital spending is still sluggish and personal consumption is 
weak overall, despite a few bright spots. 
  The basis for recovery, however, is firming, he said. 
  Capital stock adjustments will take time for full 
completion, 
but recovery can begin before that process is finished, he said. 
  Mieno also appeared to quash expectations of an imminent 
interest rate cut, saying the central bank's record low official 
discount rate, as well as money market and bank lending rates, 
are all low enough to support corporate restructuring. 
  He stressed that he is taking a long-term perspective in 
monetary policy to support sustainable, inflation-free growth 
and prevent a resurgence of the speculative "bubble" of the late 
1980s. 
  Banks remain reluctant to lend and companies reluctant to 
invest, Mieno said, adding that a "steep, large correction is 
needed" for financial institutions to clear their bad loans and 
corporations to improve their balance sheets. 
  Moreover, financial institutions should not focus solely on 
liquidating bad loans but should also show entrepreneurship to 
revitalize their businesses, he said. 
  Repeating that the main task rested with the efforts of 
corporations and institutions, Mieno said the authorities should 
pave the way. 
  He said the central bank will do its part and called for 
government "leadership" in such areas as deregulations included 
in its recent fiscal stimulus package, saying he hopes 
deregulation does not remain simply a slogan. 
  Deregulation would give companies and institutions the 
chance 
to use their "innovation potential" in new businesses and 
products, he said, calling deregulation and innovation the 
"wellspring of growth." 
  Mieno said deregulation can also play an important role in 
reducing Japan's trade imbalances with other countries.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 21 KYODO -- Rice traders expressed 
concern Monday [21 February] about the delay in Japan's 
emergency imports of rice from the United States and China for 
March. 
  The Food Agency says there is no need to worry about the 
pace 
of shipments of foreign rice, but traders say the agency is too 
optimistic. 
  "It might be difficult to secure necessary amounts of U.S. 
and Chinese rice next month, so domestic and Thai rice will be 
used to make up for them," one rice trader said. 
  The agency has said it plans to import 70 percent of total 
rice consumption for table use for the March-June period -- 20 
percent each from Thailand, China and the U.S., and 10 percent 
from Australia. 
  Japan's monthly rice consumption for table use is some 
500,000 tons, meaning that the agency has to import 350,000 tons 
of rice a month. 
  But Japan has imported only 200,000 tons so far for March 
supply, making it necessary to import 150,000 tons by the end of 
this month as it usually takes at least a month to place rice 
for sale on shelves after importation. 
  "The pace of rice imports (from China and the U.S.) has been 
picking up since the second half of February, so there is no 
concern," a Food Agency official said. 
  But rice traders said both the U.S. and China face problems 
exporting rice smoothly. 
  "A ship must often wait a long time at a (Chinese) port for 
rice to be loaded, in part because they have no experience in 
exporting and importing rice," said an official at one rice 
importer. 
  As for Californian rice, traders pointed to time-consuming 
sanitary inspections at U.S. ports. 
  "It will be necessary to raise the portion of domestic and 
long- grain Thai rice which has been imported smoothly," said an 
official at Beikoku Data Bank, a rice market research agency.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 21 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Monday [21 February] Japan will press North Korea 
to open its undeclared nuclear plants to international 
inspection. 
  Hosokawa, speaking to a House of Representatives Budget 
Committee session, said North Korea's agreement last week with 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is not enough to 
diffuse suspicions about the country's nuclear weapons program. 
  "The acceptance of (the IAEA's) inspections at only seven 
(declared nuclear facilities) cannot solve the problems," 
Hosokawa said. 
  In coordinated steps with the United States, South Korea and 
China, Japan will continue to urge the north to abandon its 
threat last March to withdraw from the nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty (NPT), the premier said. 
  He said Pyongyang must allow IAEA scientists to inspect two 
undeclared nuclear plants at Yongbyon, about 90 kilometers north 
of the capital. Some Western nations suspect the sites are 
being used to produce weapons-grade plutonium. 
  Hosokawa also urged the north to join South Korea in 
declaring the Korean peninsula a nonnuclear zone. 
  He said his government does not believe the north has 
already 
developed nuclear weapons but he voiced concern about the 
nuclear issue. "We have heard various reports." 
  On the Japan-U.S. trade dispute, Hosokawa said both nations 
"should move ahead toward the direction of revising the trade 
imbalance" out of a fear that worsening relations would have an 
adverse effects on the global economy. 
  Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton met earlier this month 
in 
Washington but failed to strike a deal on a new framework to 
slash Japan's trade surplus of more 50 billion dollars. 
  The collapse of the talks stemmed from a disagreement over a 
U.S. demand to set numerical targets to measure the openness of 
Japanese markets. Japan rejected the demand which it said would 
lead to managed trade.

  Although Japan has welcomed Pyongyang's promise to open its 
nuclear facilities to inspections by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA), "Japan will not welcome it any more if it 
is not to be carried out," Hata said at a news conference. 
  Hata's remarks represented a criticism of North Korea which 
on Monday informed the IAEA that it plans to grant visas to IAEA 
inspectors after first talking with the United States. 
  Inspectors for the UN nuclear watchdog agency had planned to 
begin checks of North Korean nuclear facilities this week, but 
have yet to receive the necessary visas from Pyongyang. 
  Hata also suggested that Japan will closely follow the 
issue, 
saying the situation may change in a couple of days since North 
Korea has asked the international nuclear watchdog for 
discussion. 
  In Washington, the State Department said the U.S. will not 
set a date for the third round of high-level talks with North 
Korea until IAEA inspections begin.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- Former Foreign Minister 
Michio Watanabe urged the government Tuesday [22 February] to 
tighten customs inspections of cargo and luggage going to North 
Korea to prevent a possible "outflow of Japanese high 
technology." 
  At a luncheon meeting at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of 
Japan, Watanabe described customs inspections in this area as 
"lax." 
  "Regarding the inspection of the carry-on baggage of Korean 
residents going to North Korea from the port of Niigata, 
inspections have been loose," said Watanabe, head of the 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party's No. 3 faction. 
  "Bulldozers, for example, have been claimed as carry-on 
baggage on the vessels and have been brought back to North 
Korea." He maintained that such goods should be subject to more 
stringent inspections. 
  Watanabe, concurrently deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister under former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, said that 
some Korean residents might have hidden high-technology products 
among cargo and luggage brought back to North Korea aboard a 
ferry from Niigata. 
  His remarks followed raids by Japanese police in January on 
some trading houses and makers of high-technology products, 
accused of exporting to North Korea "spectrum analyzers" for 
radio waves that are included on the Cocom list of restricted 
technology. 
  Cocom refers to the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral 
Export Controls. Press reports said North Korea might have used 
the equipment to upgrade the accuracy of the guidance system of 
its "Nodong" missiles. 
  Watanabe said, "because Japan has laws to prohibit the 
outflow of high-technology products to North Korea, it should 
invoke the laws strictly." 
  Watanabe urged Pyongyang to accept international inspection 
of two undeclared nuclear sites, on top of the seven declared 
nuclear facilities whose checkups it said it will accept. 
  "Unless North Korea accepts inspections of the undeclared 
sites, it will never be able to clear up suspicions," about its 
alleged nuclear arms manufacturing program, he warned. 
  "It is quite insufficient to allow the inspection only of 
the 
(seven) nuclear facilities it had earlier declared" to the IAEA, 
he said. 
  Watanabe also urged the governing coalition not to take 
retaliatory measures against the United States, even if the 
administration of President Bill Clinton imposes the "Super 301" 
punitive trade rule. 
  "Japan should not react emotionally," he said. "I can 
understand the U.S. frustration well, as Japan has run a chronic 
50 billion dollar trade surplus with the United States."

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 21 KYODO -- Japan on Monday [21 
February] welcomed NATO's suspension of air strikes against the 
last Bosnian Serb guns snowbound on the hills around Sarajevo. 
  "Our country hails the avoidance of air strikes," Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference. 
  "We hope this will lead to a first step toward peace not 
only 
in Bosnia but also in the former Yugoslavia as well," the top 
government spokesman said. 
  A deadline for the Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons or 
surrender them to United Nations peacekeepers expired at 
midnight Sunday GMT with some of the weapons still in place on 
the snowy mountains around Sarajevo. 
  But NATO agreed not to launch air strikes after Yasushi 
Akashi, a Japanese national who serves as the UN special envoy 
in Sarajevo, said he sees no need to do so, at least for the 
moment. 
  Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito also welcomed NATO's 
suspension of air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, saying it 
is a great step forward toward a peaceful solution to the 
problems in the former Yugoslavia. 
  Saito told a press conference Japan will steadily implement 
its contribution plan hammered out earlier this month after a 
government mission toured the former Yugoslavia in early January. 
  Under the plan, Japan will not participate in UN 
peacekeeping 
operations there "at present" but will extend humanitarian 
assistance of between 10 million and 15 million dollars to 
international organizations. 
  Tokyo also plans to boost economic and technical aid to 
Macedonia. 
  Saito also welcomed Russia's initiative in persuading 
Bosnian 
Serbs to begin a major withdrawal of heavy weapons around 
Sarajevo. 
  He said, however, the latest avoidance of air strikes is not 
the final solution since the problems in the former Yugoslavia 
are deep- rooted, and called on all concerned parties to try to 
solve the problems through peaceful means.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- Japan called on warring 
factions in Afghanistan Tuesday [22 February] to allow 
international relief groups to deliver emergency supplies needed 
to stave off starvation and death from cold for thousands of 
civilians. 
  Japan is deeply concerned about escalating armed hostilities 
that have caused a large number of civilian casualties in 
various regions of Afghanistan since January, Foreign Ministry 
Spokesman Terusuke Terada said in a statement. 
  Japan strongly calls on all concerned parties in Afghanistan 
not to use force to obstruct humanitarian aid activities, Terada 
said. 
  He was referring to reports that some armed groups have 
blocked aid efforts by groups such as the International 
Committee of the Red Cross. 
  Last week, a UN official said that hundreds of thousands of 
internally displaced refugees could die of cold and lack of 
food, and estimated that 200,000 citizens are trapped in 
fighting in Kabul. 
  Terada said the Japanese Government is also concerned about 
the effect of the hostilities on the repatriation of Afghan 
refugees. 
  Some 5.2 million Afghan refugees are waiting to return home 
from Pakistan and Iran, Terada said. 
  From 1979 to 1993, Tokyo extended 420 million dollars worth 
of aid to Afghan refugees through the UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR) and the World Food Program (WFP). 
  Japan has not yet recognized the Afghan Government, which 
was 
established after the fall of communist President Najibullah in 
April 1992. 
  In January, hostilities intensified between the rival forces 
of President Borhanoddin Rabbani and loyalists of Prime Minister 
Golboddin Hekmatyar.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- Israeli parliamentary 
leader Shevah Weiss [name as received] participated in a 
ceremony Tuesday [22 February] honoring the late Chiune 
Sugihara, a Japanese Vice Consul to Lithuania who provided 
transit visas to some 6,000 Jews fleeing Nazi persecution during 
World War II. 
  Weiss met earlier in the day with Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and invited him for official visit to Israel, Japanese 
officials said. 
  The speaker of the Knesset, or Israeli parliament, arrived 
in 
Japan on Monday as leader of the first Knesset delegation 
officially invited by the Diet, or Japanese parliament. 
  On behalf of Israel, Weiss received an original visa issued 
by Sugihara during a ceremony at the Israeli Embassy. 
  It was presented by Sugihara's widow, Yukiko, and Sumiko 
Simkin, widow of Joseph Simkin, a recently deceased Polish Jew 
who was a beneficiary of Sugihara's past humanitarian action. 
  Embassy officials said the visa will be preserved in the Yad 
Vashem, a national holocaust memorial in Jerusalem. 
  Simkin, who also participated in rescue operations during 
the 
war in Poland and Lithuania, came to Japan on the visa and 
remained as a businessman until his death last year. 
  As Nazi forces rolled across Poland, Sugihara issued in 
August 1940 transit visas to Japan for 6,000 Jews without prior 
authorization from Tokyo. 
  He was ordered to resign from the Foreign Ministry in 1947 
and died in July 1986 at age 86. In October 1991, the ministry 
posthumously rehabilitated him and apologized to his widow. 
  In Israel, Sugihara has been awarded the title of "righteous 
among the nations" and a small grove in a Jerusalem suburb is 
named after him. 
  Embassy officials said Weiss, a holocaust survivor, will 
visit the atomic-bombed city of Hiroshima on Friday to lay a 
wreath at a memorial.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 21 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa told Benin President Nicephore Soglo on Monday [21 
February] that Japan will give the African republic 1.11 billion 
yen to help purchase medical equipment for a national university 
and other equipment for the state-run broadcasting station. 
  Hosokawa made the pledge in a meeting with Soglo, who 
arrived 
in Japan earlier in the day for a four-day visit, Foreign 
Ministry officials said. 
  The meeting lasted nearly 40 minutes and was followed by a 
75- minute dinner, both at Hosokawa's official residence. 
  The Japanese aid includes 565 million yen to help Cononou 
National University improve its medical equipment and another 
500 million yen as a nonproject grant-in-aid, the officials said. 
  It also includes 46 million yen as the first cultural 
grant-in- aid to purchase equipment for the state-run television 
station to produce educational and cultural programs, they said. 
  The Japanese Government has already pledged Benin a total of 
400 million yen worth of aid in fiscal 1993 that ends March 31, 
1994. 
  The aid included 100 million yen in food and 300 million yen 
to increase the production of food, the officials said. 
  Benin, a small country in west Africa bordering Nigeria, is 
a 
former French colony that became a republic in 1958, changing 
its name from Dahomey in 1975. It has a population of about 
five million. 
  It was under communist rule until 1990 but is currently 
boosting democratization efforts, the officials said. 
  During the meeting, Soglo, 59, requested Japanese political 
and economic support for his nation, they said. 
  The president is scheduled to meet Emperor Akihito and 
Empress Michiko on Tuesday. He will visit Nagoya on Wednesday 
before heading home Thursday. 
  Soglo visited Japan in 1990 as prime minister to attend the 
emperor's enthronement ceremony. He also came to Tokyo last 
October to attend an international conference on aid to Africa.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report; from the "NHK News 7" program] </F>
  [Text] Ruling parties and the opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] held a meeting of the Consultative 
Council today to discuss ways to amend the Political Reform Law, 
but they failed to reach an agreement on the issue of setting a 
limit on the public raising of funds for political parties, 
which the LDP has strongly demanded. They will hold another 
meeting of the council early next week. 
  At today's meeting, the LDP asserted that the public raising 
of funds for political parties be limited to one-third the 
amount of funds the political parties raised publicly a year 
earlier and requirements for political parties raising the funds 
publicly be stringently laid down. The ruling parties, however, 
opposed the LDP's proposal, citing the disparities of revenues 
among political parties and the impossibility of newly formed 
political parties to raise the funds. 
  The LDP proposed at the meting of the Consultative Council 
that both the ruling and opposition parties decide on the 
demarcation of single-seat constituencies without entrusting all 
matters to the Constituency Demarcation Deliberation Council 
mandated to decide on the demarcation of single-seat 
constituencies for the House of Representative and both ruling 
and opposition parties decide on a bill on the demarcation of 
the single-seat constituencies. In response, the ruling parties 
agreed in principle to the LDP's proposal and the ruling and 
opposition parties will hold another meeting of the council to 
discuss ways to draft the bill. 
  The ruling and opposition parties also agreed to set up 
subcommittees in the council and start full-fledged discussions 
early next week.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 19 KYODO -- The head of the Sakigake 
(Harbinger) and a top leader of the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) as well as the governor of Hokkaido Prefecture have 
basically agreed to promote cooperation between the two parties 
in fielding candidates, sources close to the parties said 
Saturday [19 February]. 
  The accord includes fielding single candidates of the 
parties 
in the next general election, the sources said. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary and Sakigake leader Masayoshi 
Takemura, SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo and Hokkaido 
Governor Takahiro Yokomichi, a member of the SDP and its 
expected future leader, reached the agreement at a meeting in 
Tokyo on February 12, they said. 
  The three leaders made the move to promote cooperation 
between the SDP and Sakigake, two of the seven coalition 
government partners. 
  The move was also designed to counter a potential alliance 
of 
Shinseito and Komeito, two other coalition parties, the sources 
said. 
  Yokomichi confirmed the three-way meeting on Saturday. 
  The SDP and Sakigake are in favor of a new multiparty 
system. 
But Shinseito and Komeito are trying to develop a two-party 
system, saying the seven governing parties must unite to 
maintain power against the largest opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP). 
  On Thursday, Takemura met with Democratic Socialist Party 
(DSP) leader Keigo Ouchi and they confirmed the party would 
cooperate with the SDP-Sakigake camp, the sources said. Ouchi 
is also health and welfare minister. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Takemura are at 
loggerheads as the premier reportedly wants to drop Takemura 
from his cabinet, sources close to the coalition parties said. 
  Hosokawa and Takemura played key roles last year in 
establishing the first non-LDP government in 38 years. 
  In a related development, Koken Nosaka, chairman of the 
SDP's 
Diet Administration Committee, told reporters in Tottori that he 
favors a "drastic" reshuffle of the Hosokawa cabinet after the 
Diet approves the fiscal 1994 budget.

  [Text] Aizuwakamatsu, Fukushima Pref., Feb. 19 KYODO -- 
Kozo Watanabe, a senior leader of Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party], voiced support Saturday [19 February] for merging five 
of Japan's governing coalition parties into a single party. 
  Watanabe, a former trade minister, made the remarks in a 
speech in Aizuwakamatsu, Fukushima Prefecture, in northern Japan. 
  He mentioned Shinseito, Komeito, the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP), the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and the 
parliamentary group composed of Sakigake (Harbinger) and Japan 
New Party (JNP) as parties that could form single force to 
maintain power against the primary opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP). 
  Watanabe said, "we have responsibility for merging the five 
political forces into a single party prior to the April 1995 
nationwide local elections and the July 1995 House of 
Councillors election." 
  Shinseito, a splinter from the LDP, would put priority on 
merging with the JNP, headed by Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, and Sakigake as a first step toward reorganizing 
Japanese politics, Watanabe said, adding, "we will then call on 
the SDP, the DSP and Komeito to join the force." 
  He said the five political forces should forge a single 
party 
to satisfy the Japanese people. 
  Shinseito and Komeito have said the governing coalition 
parties must unite to create a two-party system, sustain a 
coalition government and prevent the LDP from regaining power. 
  The LDP lost its 38-year grip on power last August shortly 
after its defeat in the July 18 general election.

  [Text] Misawa, Aomori Pref., Feb. 20 KYODO -- The leader 
of the Social Democratic Party balked Sunday [20 February] at a 
proposal to merge the seven ruling coalition parties into a new 
large party to beat the opposition Liberal Democratic Party in 
an upcoming general election. 
  "It is impossible (for the seven) to become a single party 
due to the differences in their perceptions of the nation and 
the Constitution," said Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the 
biggest force in the governing coalition. 
  Murayama made the remarks at a news conference while 
addressing a move to unify the seven parties into a single 
party, being pushed by Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] co-leader 
Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa. 
  He was apparently referring to an intracoalition rift on 
such 
sensitive issues as a proposal to expand Japan's involvement in 
U.N. peacekeeping operations and perceptions of the 
constitutional status of Japan's Self-Defense Forces. 
  The SDP leader said the seven parties could field joint 
candidates in each of the newly created, 300 single-seat 
constituencies for elections for the House of Representatives 
without forming a single party. 
  "We should seek to field joint candidates under the outline 
of taking a joint stand against the LDP," Murayama said. 
  His comments followed a recent warning by Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa that a possible failure by the seven parties 
to field joint candidates would give the LDP an advantage in 
general elections by possibly splitting ballots among those 
voters critical of the LDP. 
  Murayama ruled out the possibility that his party would 
immediately merge with the Democratic Socialist Party and 
Sakigake (Harbinger) to form a new party. 
  "It was by mere coincidence that (the three parties) shared 
the same stand of (opposing) the proposed national welfare tax 
and a cabinet reshuffle," he said. 
  The three parties were reportedly infuriated earlier this 
month when Hosokawa and Ozawa sought to impose a 7-percent 
indirect tax without holding prior consultations with them.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- Social Democratic Party 
[of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said Tuesday 
[22 february] his party will remain in the ruling coalition to 
"enhance the transparency of the country's politics." 
  In an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE, Murayama said "a 
political force to replace the 38-year-long corruption-ridden 
politics of the Liberal Democratic Party could not be formed 
without the participation of the SDPJ." 
  "That political parties with different stances and policies 
are supporting the coalition government is, in a sense, a demand 
of the times, and will heighten the transparency of 
politics...(the SDPJ's participation) is significant in that 
sense," Murayama said. 
  The SDPJ is the leading bloc in the seven-party coalition 
government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, which was 
launched last August after the ouster of the LDP from power and 
the placing of priority on legislating political reforms aimed 
at cleaning up the country's politics. 
  Asked why the SDPJ would stick with the coalition after last 
month's enactment of political reform bills, Murayama said "(the 
next) general elections (under the new system mixing single-seat 
districts and proportional representation) will be a turning 
point deciding the framework of the coalition." 
  As for Hosokawa's plan to reshuffle his cabinet as early as 
late this month, the SDPJ chief reiterated his opposition, 
saying "if the reshuffle is conducted to replace a specific 
minister, it is wrong." 
  "The most important thing (for the government) right now is 
pump- priming measures for the economy. Ministers responsible 
for (enacting) the fiscal 1994 budget should be exerting their 
efforts for the people and (thus) a cabinet reshuffle at present 
is inappropriate," Murayama said. 
  Hosokawa has expressed hopes of reorganizing his cabinet 
later this month, with the media speculating that this could 
mean the removal of Masayoshi Takemura from the key post of 
chief cabinet secretary, perhaps to another position. 
  Murayama said he would not accept a ministerial post even if 
urged by Hosokawa to join his new cabinet. "I assumed the SDPJ 
chairmanship in response to party members' requests to maintain 
party unity. Circumstances within the party will not allow me 
to join (the cabinet)," he said. 
  On financial sources to offset the 6 trillion yen in tax 
cuts, Murayama said, "the tax cuts apply only to fiscal 1994. I 
think (the government) will implement tax reductions even after 
the year...But before that (the SDPJ) will call for a thorough 
rectification of the inequitable tax system." 
  Following that, he said, the government should propose and 
seek the support of the people for a new tax to cover the costs 
of the ongoing aging of society. 
  If the government takes other steps to get the support of 
the 
people on a new tax to finance welfare and pensions, there will 
be no need to hold general elections on the issue, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Tuesday [22 February] he has told his top aides to 
look into the possibility of an alliance of five 
intraparliamentary groups within the House of Representatives to 
counter the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). 
  Reacting to a front-page article in the Tuesday morning 
edition of a major daily, the MAINICHI SHIMBUN, he told 
reporters he discussed the matter with top aides in his Japan 
New Party [JNP]. 
  The MAINICHI said that Hosokawa gave the instruction earlier 
this month in a bid to eventually unite his JNP with Sakigake 
(Harbinger), Shinseito, Komeito, the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP). 
  The premier is seeking a pre-election alliance of the five 
intraparliamentary groups to win a majority in the next general 
elections for the lower house, which will feature a new 
electoral system with 300 single-seat constituencies and 200 
seats chosen by proportional representation, the daily said. 
  JNP and Sakigake currently maintain an intraparliamentary 
group within the lower house. 
  Hosokawa's fresh proposal marks a departure from his 
previous 
desire to see a multiparty system in Japan and signals his 
inclination to have a two-party system, which is also favored by 
Shinseito and Komeito, the MAINICHI said. 
  But the proposal runs counter to the views of Sakigake 
leader 
and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who favors a 
coalition of Sakigake and the liberal segments of the LDP, SDP 
and DSP by distancing itself from Shinseito and Soka 
Gakkai-backed Komeito. 
  Takemura, reportedly under pressure from Hosokawa and 
Shinseito co-leader Ichiro Ozawa to quit the key cabinet post, 
predicted last weekend that three or four major parties will 
compete in the next general elections, which may be held in the 
fall of 1995. 
  Takemura opposed Hosokawa's five-party alliance plan and 
said 
at a news conference that it is "imperialistic" and 
"expansionist."

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 21 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's wife said Monday [21 February] her husband and his 
chief of staff Masayoshi Takemura have a good relationship, 
denying press reports that the two men are at odds. 
  Kayoko Hosokawa said, "It is natural that the premier and 
the 
chief cabinet secretary express different opinions," noting that 
the Hosokawa Cabinet is different from previous governments 
under control of the Liberal Democratic Party. The difference 
between Hosokawa and Takemura "doesn't mean a gap between them 
has widened," she said. "Contrary to media reports, their 
relationship is not serious." 
  She also told reporters she has doubts about the media 
because they often distort facts or write stories based on 
imagination. 
  She did not say whether the prime minister wanted to remove 
Takemura from the key post of chief cabinet secretary and give 
him another position. The premier has expressed hopes of 
reorganizing his six-month cabinet later this month, which the 
media has speculated could mean the removal of Takemura. 
  Parties in Hosokawa's ruling coalition are divided on an 
early cabinet reshuffle, with the Social Democratic Party (SDP), 
the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and Takemura's Sakigake 
(Harbinger) against it, and Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and 
Komeito pushing strongly for it.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 20 KYODO -- The likelihood of a 
cabinet reshuffle in late February or early March increased 
Sunday [20 February] after two previously reluctant coalition 
parties expressed readiness to accept the move proposed by Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP), said, "the cabinet reshuffle comes under the jurisdiction 
of the prime minister, so we will back it if he is determined to 
do so." 
  But he told a press conference that the cabinet should 
preferably be reshuffled after the Diet passes the fiscal 1994 
state budget, possibly around April. 
  The SDP, the biggest force in the seven-party coalition 
government, and Sakigake (Harbinger) have opposed an early 
cabinet reshuffle plan. 
  SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo said on a public 
television 
news program that he cannot help dropping his earlier dissent if 
Hosokawa believes the reshuffle is necessary to eliminate policy 
differences within the cabinet. 
  The focus of the projected cabinet reshuffle concerns the 
fate of Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. 
  Takemura, the top government spokesman and leader of the 14- 
member Sakigake, reportedly alienated Hosokawa and Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party] co-leader Ichiro Ozawa over his opposition 
to Hosokawa's plan in early februrary to impose a new 7 percent 
indirect tax on goods and services. The plan was later scrapped. 
  Ozawa, a key strategist in the ruling coalition, was 
reported 
late last year to have urged Hosokawa to remove Takemura from 
the key cabinet post. 
  Takemura, who had put up harsh resistance to the reshuffle 
plan, withdrew his opposition Saturday by saying in Nagoya that 
it is up to Hosokawa to decide to reshuffle his cabinet. 
  Hosokawa and Takemura met Sunday morning to discuss the 
projected cabinet reshuffle, political sources said. 
  Sakigake Executive Hiroyuki Sonoda hinted on the same NHK 
(Japan Broadcasting Corp.) program Sunday that the party is 
ready to accept the reshuffle if Takemura can retain a cabinet 
post. 
  "We have not thought of the possibility that our party may 
break away from the governing coalition," Sonoda said. 
  "If the prime minister is in need of our party, it is the 
best solution (for our party) to continue to help him by 
remaining within the cabinet," he said. 
  A reshuffling of the six-month-old cabinet is expected to 
come at the end of February or early March following passage of 
a third supplementary budget for the current fiscal 1993, the 
sources said. 
  Hosokawa's Japan New Party and six other parties, including 
Sakigake, the SDP, Shinseito and Komeito, make up the governing 
coalition. 
  Meanwhile, Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa said on 
the same program and on a private television program that 
cabinet changes will take place in late February or early March. 
  Ichikawa blamed the reshuffle debate on Takemura and said 
the 
cabinet changes will be "very limited."

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 21 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa asked two coalition party leaders Monday [21 February] 
to agree to his plan to reshuffle the cabinet later this month, 
which is expected to center on removing Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura from his post. 
  Officials said the prime minister filed the request during a 
three-way meeting with Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social 
Democratic Party [of Japan] (sDP) [SDPJ], the largest among the 
seven ruling parties, and Keigo Ouchi, chairman of the 
Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), who is health and welfare 
minister. 
  Murayama reaffirmed his opposition to an early cabinet 
reshuffle, telling the prime minister, "an early reshaping 
targeted at a specific cabinet member would cause turmoil." 
  Ouchi echoed the SDPJ leader and called for prudence on 
Hosokawa's part, the officials said. 
  In the meeting, Hosokawa reiterated his hope to reshuffle 
the 
cabinet soon after the passage, expected this week, of the third 
supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 and of bills revising the 
political reform package, they said. 
  Hosokawa told Murayama and Ouchi that he will make a 
decision 
after hearing the opinions of all the seven coalition party 
leaders. 
  The seven parties are divided on the proposed cabinet 
reshuffle, with the SDPJ, DSP and Takemura's Sakigake against it 
and Shinseito and Komeito pushing strongly for it. 
  Hosokawa's own Japan New Party has a formal alliance with 
Sakigake, making its stand on the reshuffle complicated, while 
the attitude of the United Social Democratic Party is not clear. 
  Earlier on Monday, Hosokawa told a session of the House of 
Representatives Budget Committee that he may think of the 
reshuffle after the Diet finishes debate on amendments to the 
political reform package and third supplementary budget 
conclusion. 
  Takemura told reporters Monday he has not accepted 
Hosokawa's 
plan to remove him from the post of the chief cabinet secretary 
and name him to another ministerial position. 
  Newspaper reports earlier Monday said Takemura is ready to 
give up the key cabinet post.

  [Text] Misawa, Aomori Pref., Feb. 20 KYODO -- Social 
Democratic Party (SDP) Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said Sunday 
[20 February] his party will drop its objection to a proposed 
cabinet reshuffle, urging it to be conducted after Diet passage 
of the fiscal 1994 state budget. 
  "It is appropriate (to reshuffle the cabinet) after the Diet 
passes the fiscal 1994 budget or after the current regular Diet 
session ends," the SDP chief told a news conference. 
  The budget is expected to get parliamentary approval around 
April. The Diet, which convened its regular session on January 
31, is to wrap up its 150-day session on June 29. 
  The SDP is the biggest force in the seven-party coalition 
government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Its objection 
to the cabinet revamping proposed by Hosokawa has been deemed 
the biggest obstacle to realization of the proposal. 
  "The cabinet reshuffle comes under the jurisdiction of the 
prime minister, so we will back it if he is determined to do 
so," Murayama said. 
  Meanwhile, Wataru Kubo, the right-hand man of Murayama, said 
on a Sunday television program that he cannot help dropping his 
earlier dissent if Hosokawa believes the reshuffle is necessary 
to eliminate policy differences within the cabinet. 
  SDP Secretary General Kubo, however, balked at a growing 
move 
to merge coalition parties into a new party to make it easier to 
field joint candidates in the newly created 300 single-seat 
constituencies for an upcoming general election. 
  "It is difficult for coalition partners to form a unified 
party in view of (the differences in) their perceptions of the 
nation and political ideologies," he said. 
  However, he called for coalition parties to make efforts to 
field joint candidates in the new House of Representatives 
constituencies to defeat the Liberal Democratic Party and other 
opposition parties.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- The leader of the Social 
Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] on Tuesday [22 
February] renewed his opposition to an immediate shakeup of 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's cabinet. 
  "Now is the time for the cabinet and ruling parties to act 
as 
one in order to do their utmost to get the (fiscal 1994) budget 
passed," SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told a news conference. 
  He said he wants a cabinet reshuffle to be timed after the 
Diet approves the budget, possibly around April or later, rather 
than at the end of this month. 
  Murayama denied, however, the SDPJ will withdraw from the 
coalition if a cabinet reshaping counters his viewpoint. 
  Coalition sources said Hosokawa plans to reorganize his six- 
month-old cabinet around next Monday after passage of the third 
supplementary budget for fiscal 1993, ending March 31. 
  The SDPJ is the largest contingent in Hosokawa's seven-party 
coalition, which toppled the Liberal Democratic Party from power 
last August for the first time in 38 years.

  [Text] Nagoya, Feb. 19 KYODO -- Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura said Saturday [19 February] he is opposed to 
a cabinet reshuffle before the Diet passage of the 73.08 
trillion yen fiscal 1994 state budget. 
  But Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's chief spokesman said 
in a speech in Nagoya that the premier has the final say on the 
reshuffle, which politicians both inside and outside the 
government say is aimed primarily at dumping Takemura. 
  He said he has no desire to cling to the post of chief 
cabinet secretary. 
  Speaking of a probable realignment of the nation's political 
parties, Takemura predicted it will revolve around a vision of 
Japan's future and the characters of political parties. 
  His statement suggested that Takemura's Sakigake (Harbinger) 
party will distance itself from Shinseito and Komeito, two of 
the seven coalition government partners. 
  Specifically, Takemura expressed hope that his party will be 
part of a coalition including such reform-minded men as former 
Justice Minister Masaharu Gotoda and liberal representatives of 
the Social Democratic Party such as Hokkaido Governor Takahiro 
Yokomichi.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- The House of 
Representatives Budget Committee on Tuesday approved a third 
supplementary budget for current fiscal 1993 which is designed 
to help finance the government's latest pump-priming measures. 
  The full lower house is expected to pass the supplementary 
budget later in the day and to immediately send it to the House 
of Councillors for further deliberations. 
  The budget is expected to become law Wednesday after 
obtaining approval from the second chamber, Diet sources said. 
  The extra budget calls for a spending increase of 2,185.2 
billion yen over the second supplementary budget, covering the 
largest-ever economic stimulus package of 15.25 trillion yen, 
and an increase of the overall general account budget for the 
current year ending in March to 77,437.50 billion yen.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 19 KYODO -- Investment by national and 
local governments in fiscal 1991 that ended in March 1992 rose 
9.6 percent to an all-time high of 40.34 trillion yen, 
reflecting increased public works spending, the Home Affairs 
Ministry said Saturday [19 February]. 
  The ministry said the rise in state and local government 
investment stemmed mainly from a jump in local government 
projects which came to 14.67 trillion yen, up 1.7 trillion yen 
or 12.9 percent from the previous year. 
  Ministry officials said local governments are steadily 
improving infrastructure such as roads, parks and housing. 
  By category, roads accounted for 26.4 percent of the total 
investment, followed by educational facilities with 9.1 percent, 
agriculture, forestry and fisheries projects with 8.3 percent, 
land preservation programs with 8.2 percent and sewage projects 
with 7.8 percent. 
  The ministry said cities and towns accounted for 46.0 
percent 
of total investment, prefectures 32.8 percent and the central 
government 21.2 percent. 
  The Tokyo Metropolitan Government headed a list of 
prefectures in terms of investment, accounting for 4.87 trillion 
yen or 12.1 percent of the total, followed by Hokkaido with 2.39 
trillion yen, Osaka with 2.36 trillion yen and Kanagawa with 
2.31 trillion yen. 
  But in terms of per capita investment, Shimane Prefecture in 
southwestern Japan topped the list for four years in a row with 
497,082 yen, followed by Kochi, Tottori, Hokkaido and Tokyo, the 
ministry said. 
  Former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, a native of Shimane 
Prefecture, has been widely credited with a lot of pork barrel 
projects in his home prefecture.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- Japan's top banker said 
Tuesday [22 February] he sees signs of recovery in consumer 
spending amid the continued national economic slowdown. 
  Tadashi Okuda, chairman of the Federation of Bankers 
Associations of Japan, told reporters that sales are increasing 
for some home electronics products and other consumer goods. 
  Okuda also praised the Finance Ministry's recently announced 
guidelines for banks writing off bad debts, saying they give 
individual banks a wider range of options.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- The key indexes of 
economic indicators remained well below the boom-or-bust line of 
50 percent in December, showing that Japan's economy still 
remains in a slump, the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said 
Tuesday [22 February]. 
  The coincident indicator, which represents the current state 
of the economy, was well below the 50 percent line for the third 
straight month at 25.0 percent, following a preliminary reading 
of 20 percent in the previous two months. 
  The leading indicator, which projects economic conditions a 
few months ahead, was at 36.4 percent, below the 50 percent line 
for the eighth month in a row. 
  Preliminary figures were 41.7 percent for November and 33.3 
percent for October. 
  The index for raw material inventories was down 2.2 percent, 
falling to the negative side for the first time in two months 
with the rise in electrical machinery and chemical-related goods 
shipments. 
  Machinery orders slipped to the minus side for the first 
time 
in two months. 
  The Nikkei commodity index was up 0.7 percent, showing 
positive growth for the first time in 10 months due to the 
smaller drop in nonferrous metal prices. 
  The rest of the components in the leading indicator remained 
on the minus side. 
  In the coincident indicator, the only change was that the 
department store sales index was flat compared with the negative 
side it was on in November. 
  This was attributed mainly to a smaller decline in sales of 
menswear. 
  Electricity consumption and the index for commercial sales 
continued on an uptrend. 
  The rest of the components such as industrial production, 
were on the minus side. 
  The lagging indicator for December was zero percent, 
unchanged from the preliminary zero percent the previous month. 
  An official at the EPA said that although the general 
picture 
is sluggish, some signs in the individual components point to 
hopes of a slight recovery. 
  He noted that among the leading indicator components, 
employment is picking up in the construction industry due to the 
demand in public works, and that the floor space of new 
constructions shows a slight increase. 
  The housing sector could begin to pick up now that the 
government has decided to ease housing loan terms in its 
economic package, the official said. 
  "I think the figures for January will be better, perhaps 
even 
reaching the 50 percent level," he said. "But there's really no 
knowing what will happen with the possibility of the yen gaining 
ground," he said, referring to the Japanese currency whose rise 
could dampen economic recovery.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- A Diet committee decided 
Tuesday [22 February] to ask both the public prosecutors office 
and the National Tax Administration Agency to submit any 
documents they may have concerning a payment of money which 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa claims was a loan from 
scandal-tainted trucking company Sagawa Kyubin. 
  The House of Representatives Budget Committee made the 
decision in a bid to substantiate Hosokawa's assertion that he 
repaid a 1982 loan of 100 million yen from Kiyoshi Sagawa, then 
chairman of the Sagawa Kyubin group of trucking and 
parcel-delivery firms and one of key figures in a money-and-mob 
scandal. 
  Committee debates on a third supplementary budget for fiscal 
1993 were interrupted to deal with the matter after negotiations 
by senior committee officials over the issue ran into problems, 
parliamentary sources said. 
  Hosokawa has said he borrowed the money to buy a condominium 
and repair his home in Kumamoto, western Japan, and that he 
repaid the loan by January 31, 1991. 
  On Tuesday morning, Hosokawa turned in a "certificate" 
issued 
by the Tokyo branch of Sagawa Kyubin which says "the 100 million 
yen has been entirely repaid and collateral rights have ceased." 
  But two opposition parties, the Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP) and the Japanese Communist Party, were not satisfied with 
the document. 
  Hosokawa last December submitted a memo to the opposition 
intended to substantiate his claim. 
  The Sagawa Kyubin group was embroiled in a money scandal 
involving a number of leading figures, including Shin Kanemaru, 
former LDP kingmaker, who was charged with tax evasion last 
March.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- The Posts Ministry's 
latest decision to change its policy on format of the 
next-generation television system has the Trade Ministry 
baffled, a senior trade ministry official said Tuesday [22 
February]. The new policy would not serve anyone's interest in 
Japan, said the official at the Ministry of International Trade 
and Industry (MITI) who declined to be named. 
  The electronics industry was plunged into confusion when a 
senior official at the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry on 
Tuesday unveiled a plan to switch from an analog system to a 
digital system in the format of razor-sharp high-definition 
television (HDTV). The Posts Ministry has supported the analog 
system developed by Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK), and the 
electronics industry has invested huge sums of money into its 
development. 
  The sudden policy change is "unconvincing" and all segments 
of Japan -- NHK, electronics makers, retailers and consumers -- 
will be affected negatively, the MITI official said. 
  Akimasa Egawa, director general of the Broadcasting 
Administration Bureau at the Posts Ministry, announced the 
switch at a news conference, explaining that NHK's adherence to 
the analog HDTV system could spawn a new source of trade 
friction. NHK has been experimenting with analog HDTV 
broadcasting, known as hi-vision, since 1991, and consumers have 
purchased hi-vision televisions. 
  The sudden move toward a change in high-definition TV system 
standards took consumer electronics companies by surprise, 
leaving them worried about a possible drop in sales of the HDTV 
systems now on the market. 
  "It's certain that sales of the existing products (based on 
NHK's analog system) will drop," said an official at Sony Corp. 
Sony and other electronics companies have been betting on the 
analog HDTV's success to provide them with a long-awaited hit 
product. 
  "Our industry as a whole has invested some 300 billion yen," 
said an official at one major electronics company. But the 
official and others noted that a shift toward a digital HDTV 
system will be a benefit in the long run and it is not so hard 
for them to go after such a system. 
  If HDTV standards are unified into a digital system, it 
could 
save time and money needed to develop different systems and the 
benefits of mass production could be expected, the official said. 
  "If there is a change in standards, we will be able to 
respond to it with the development of a decorder for a digital 
system," said an official at Toshiba Corp. 
  NHK itself reacted with anger to Egawa's remarks, saying 
they 
hinder the promotion of HDTV systems and run counter to audience 
expectations. "Mr. Egawa's remarks, which imply a review of the 
muse system, hinder the progress of hi-vision promotion, spoil 
the efforts hitherto made by the concerned parties, run counter 
to audience expectation, and are thus very regrettable," NHK 
said in a statement. 
  "Nhk will promote hi-vision as ever, respecting the report 
by 
the Radio Regulatory Council to the Minister of Posts and 
Telecommunications published last May, such that the council 
considers...The muse system as the proper broadcasting system of 
HDTV in Japan in the post BS-3 broadcasting satellite era," the 
statement said. 
  A senior official at NHK, which has been aggressively 
promoting the analog-based hi-vision system, branded Egawa's 
remarks as a personal view. "They are a personal opinion by the 
director general rather than the view of the ministry," the 
official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- An industry association 
demanded Tuesday [22 February] that the Postal Ministry rescind 
its decision to promote the development of a digital 
high-definition television (HDTV) system to replace an analog 
system developed by Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK). 
  The Electronic Industries Association of Japan issued a 
statement expressing regret over the policy switch by the 
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. 
  Akimasa Egawa, director general of the Broadcasting 
Administration Bureau at the Ministry, announced the policy 
switch at a news conference earlier Tuesday, saying that if NHK 
stuck to the analog HDTV system, it could become a new source of 
trade friction. 
  The industry group comprises major Japanese electronics 
manufacturers, which are already selling analog HDTV systems 
based on NHK technologies. 
  The statement said the ministry decision would cause 
unnecessary confusion for consumers and for the electronics 
industry. 
  NHK has been experimenting with analog HDTV broadcasting, 
known as hi-vision, since 1991. 
  The government-backed Hi-Vision Promotion Association said 
in 
another statement that the hi-vision broadcasts will not be 
discontinued in the immediate future. 
  It urged the ministry to continue promoting hi-vision 
broadcasts to protect hi-vision television owners.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 21 (YONHAP) -- Defense Minister Yi 
Pyong-tae said Monday that the government recognizes the need 
for U.S. forces in South Korea to deploy Patriot missiles, but 
said Seoul presently has no plans to purchase them. 
  Deployment of Patriot missiles in Korea as part of weapons 
modernization by U.S. forces here would greatly deter the threat 
of war on the peninsula by strengthening their defense 
capability, according to Yi's script of prepared answers for 
Monday's National Assembly interpellation. 
  Although in favor of having Patriot missiles in Korea, Yi 
denied reports that Seoul would purchase Patriots as well as 
Apache helicopters, saying the Defense Ministry has no such 
plans at present. He said the ministry will conduct a 
comparative study of similar equipment from around the world to 
decide on the best possible defense system if modernization is 
deemed necessary. 
  Yi said the Seoul-Washington annual military exercise "Team 
Spirit" was the most powerful counterbalance against North 
Korea's nuclear development program. Therefore, it is 
undesirable for Seoul to first propose suspension of Team 
Spirit, he added. He admitted that the ministry has drawn up a 
readiness plan as the South is always under threat of a North 
Korean attack. South Korean and U.S. intelligence officers meet 
twice every year to study and appraise North Korea's military 
power, he said.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 21 (YONHAP) -- Gen. Cho Yong-kil, 
director of the Strategic Planning Bureau at the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff (JCS) headquarters, denied reports Monday that the Defense 
Ministry plans to bring in Patriot missiles from 1997 as part of 
Korea's next-generation anti-air defense project. 
  Defense authorities have looked into replacing aging Nike 
Hercules and Hawk (homing all-the-way killer) missiles with more 
advanced surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems because parts will 
be difficult to get after 2000, Cho said. But no decision has 
been made on introducing Patriot missiles from 1997 and 
including them in the long-term weapons procurement blueprint, 
joint strategic objectives plan (J-SOP), he said. "We will be 
able to decide on the next-generation anti-aircraft missile 
project in four to five years, after sufficient testing of 
similar weapons from all over the world," he said. 
  Rep. Yim Pok-chin of the opposition Democratic Party (DP) 
claimed that the Defense Ministry had included introduction of 
Patriot missiles in the SAM-X project starting in 1997 in 
Monday's interpellation.

  [Text] The ROK Defense Ministry has announced it is 
examining a plan to replace various types of existing antiair 
missiles with new types of missiles. Today, the Defense 
Ministry said: The ministry is examining a plan to introduce 
new types of missiles because the Nike Hercules missile our 
military has is too old and the Hawk missile has limitations for 
improvement. The ministry also said that it is examining the 
Patriot missile and the ERINT [extended-range interceptor 
missile], which the U.S. Defense Department had recently decided 
to introduce.

  [Text] Opposition Democratic Party spokesman Pak Chi-won 
yesterday called on the United States to accept Seoul's demand 
not to deploy Patriot antimissile batteries in South Korea in 
order to avoid upsetting North Korea. 
  "We are supporting Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's remarks 
on 
the Patriot deployment plan," Pak said in a statement. 
  Foreign Minister Han, who is in Washington to meet with U.S. 
officials, said Thursday that Seoul was reconsidering whether it 
still wanted Washington to send Patriot missiles now that 
tensions with Pyongyang have abated as a result of the North's 
decision to allow inspections of its nuclear installations.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Chin Chang-uk from Washington] </F>
  [Text] The problem concerning the deployment of Patriot 
missiles to the Korean peninsula is expected to become a 
delicate diplomatic and security issue as the ROK and the United 
States have expressed different opinions on the issue. The ROK 
and the United States agreed in principle to the deployment of 
Patriot missiles in December 1993 when sanctions on the North 
were being seriously discussed due to North Korea's persistent 
negative stance toward the resolution of the nuclear issue. 
  The two countries began to disagree, however, about the need 
for the deployment of Patriot missiles after North Korea 
accepted International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspections 
on 15 February. 
  By formalizing the issue of the deployment of Patriot 
missiles to the Korean peninsula, in addition to the military 
preparation for the possibility of North Korea's southward 
provocation, the U.S. Government used the deployment as a 
warning to North Korea that a southward provocation should not 
be attempted and as a political and diplomatic demonstration 
that the United States can enforce UN sanctions on North Korea. 
  On the other hand, public opinion in the ROK have focused on 
political problems, rather than military effectiveness, citing 
that Patriot missiles are not appropriate for Korean peninsula's 
terrain and have very low accuracy. ROK media emphasized 
concern that in addition to such military defects, the 
deployment of Patriot missiles to the Korean peninsula might 
arouse negative effects on the acceptance of nuclear inspections 
by agitating North Korea. 
  In addition, it was strongly suspected that the United 
States 
was trying to sell inefficient weapons to the ROK at a high 
price. In this regard, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu visited 
the United States on 10 February and asked U.S. Defense 
Secretary William Perry to postpone the decision on the 
deployment of Patriot missiles to the Korean peninsula until 
after the IAEA Board of Governors meeting on 21 February. 
  When North Korea notified the IAEA of its willingness to 
accept nuclear inspections on 15 February, Minister Han 
proclaimed in Washington that the deployment of Patriot missiles 
should be reconsidered and the issue has since become an issue 
of disagreement on a full scale. 
  Before and after Minister Han's remarks, the U.S. Defense 
Department revealed that it will not consider the ROK 
Government's opinion by raising the objection that the 
deployment of Patriot missiles is purely a military issue that 
cannot become an issue in political negotiations and by 
expressing its intention to separate the Patriot missile issue 
from political issues. 
  Before North Korea announced its acceptance of nuclear 
inspections, the ROK and U.S. Governments agreed that the 
deployment of the missiles was politically and militarily 
appropriate. After the notification of the acceptance of 
nuclear inspections, however, differences in positions emerged 
because the United States stressed military reasons, while the 
ROK stressed the Patriots were not needed for political reasons. 
  The U.S. Defense Department is stressing that the deployment 
of Patriot missiles to the Korean peninsula has become a major 
issue because it was reported by the media at the same time the 
North Korean nuclear issue became an urgent matter. Actually, 
the deployment has nothing to do with the nuclear inspections in 
North Korea. 
  The U.S. stance is that the deployment is part of the plan 
to 
establish the Theater Missile Defense system connecting the ROK 
and Japan -- which was planned in 1991 long before the North 
Korean nuclear issue emerged -- when North Korea concluded the 
development of Nodong No. 1 missile. 
  The fact that the United States is pushing ahead with the 
deployment of Patriot missiles at the same time North Korea has 
accepted nuclear inspections appears it is a strong sales motive 
to make a final pitch in the prolonged effort to sell Patriot 
missiles to the ROK, thus taking advantage of the situation. 
  This is the time for the United States to consider the fact 
that if they overly stress the sale of Patriot missiles, while 
the U.S. Army has already selected ERINT [extended-range 
interceptor missile] as the next-generation interceptor missile 
instead of Patriots, it may weaken ROK-U.S. security cooperation.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular newspapers on 22 
February carry editorials on the possible deployment of Patriot 
missiles to the ROK. 
  The moderate CHOSON ILBO on page 3 carries an 800-word 
editorial entitled, "Dispute Over the Patriot Missile." The 
editorial notes that it is understandable that "the deployment 
of the Patriot missile will be helpful in maintaining security 
on the Korean peninsula, but if the government is to purchase it 
for a high price, it will have to examine its feasibility and 
effectiveness." The editorial goes on to say that it seems that 
"the Defense Ministry does not have a clear policy on this 
matter." The editorial says that "if the Patriot missile is a 
weapon that can effectively take countermeasures against North 
Korea's airplanes and Scud missiles, it will be of help in 
deterring war on the Korean peninsula." However, it notes that 
the plan to deploy the Patriot missile is not purely to build up 
defense capability and goes on to explain that the Patriot 
missile is now "out-of-date," and stresses the need to make 
"prudent" examinations before making a decision on introducing 
the Patriot missile. The editorial then elaborates on the ROK 
arms system which is dependent on the United States and notes 
that the ROK must revise its system in introducing arms. The 
editorial concludes by stressing the need to guarantee 
transparency in the process of introducing arms, and that there 
must be a device to effectively execute the defense budget in 
its military capability. 
  The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN on page 3 carries an 
800-word 
editorial entitled, "The Deployment of the Patriot Missile to 
the U.S. Forces Stationed in the ROK." The editorial starts by 
saying that "dispute over the deployment of Patriot missiles to 
the ROK is divided." The editorial says that there is 
disagreement regarding this matter between the ROK and the 
United States but notes that it is not a big problem. It goes 
on to explain that the examination of deploying the Patriot 
missile is a just matter because "North Korea has already 
reserved large amounts of chemical and biological weapons and 
has succeeded in the test of its medium range missile which has 
a range of 1,000 km." It notes that the deployment of the 
Patriot missile is the best way to deal with North Korea's 
missile development. The editorial continues to say that there 
is no reason to oppose the deployment of the Patriot missile to 
the ROK, and stresses that "the deployment of the Patriot 
missile to the U.S. forces in the ROK and introducing it to the 
ROK Army are different issues." The editorial concludes by 
saying that "since there is no effective alternative," it hopes 
that "regardless of North Korea's nuclear development, the 
up-to-date Patriot missile can be deployed to U.S. forces 
stationed in the ROK as soon as possible."

  [Text] Robert Galluci, U.S. assistant secretary of State 
for political and military affairs; and Thomas Hubbard, deputy 
assistant secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific affairs, 
who are in charge of the U.S. channel for nuclear negotiations 
with North Korea, will visit the ROK late this month or early 
next month to make final adjustment to the ROK and U.S. 
positions toward the North Korean nuclear issue and to discuss 
joint measures. This visit attracts people's attention because 
it is to be made before the third round of high-level U.S.-North 
Korea talks, which are expected to be held around mid-March. 
  A diplomatic source in Washington on 19 February said that 
Assistant Secretary Galluci, senior delegate to the high-level 
talks; and Deputy Assistant Secretary Hubbard, delegate to the 
New York working-level contact, revealed their plan to visit the 
ROK to ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu when Minister Han 
visited Washington on 17 February. 
  The source noted that the third round of talks will include 
important negotiations in which pending issues such as: special 
inspection, improvement of relations and establishment of 
diplomatic relations, and economic assistance. They will be 
comprehensively discussed and a package settlement will be 
sought. Therefore, the United States seems to believe that a 
prior grasp and understanding of the atmosphere and position of 
the ROK and final-stage discussions with the ROK Government are 
necessary.

<F P=106> [By Yi Tong-min] </F>
  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 19 (YONHAP) -- North Korea announced 
Wednesday that it would accept International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) inspections, but has taken no steps to back up its 
promise. North Korea said it would issue visas to IAEA 
inspectors in the near future, and the speculation was that the 
team would be able to enter Pyongyang via Beijing this weekend. 
But as of Saturday morning, no news on the visas had arrived. 
A Foreign Ministry official said nothing will happen this week. 
  The timing of the IAEA's entry into North Korea is a crucial 
point because the agency's Board of Governors meets from Monday. 
The international community expected Pyongyang to quickly issue 
the visas so the inspection process could begin before the board 
meeting, whose main topic is the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  Only limited flights are available to Pyongyang from 
Beijing. 
Even if the inspectors received visas early next week, the 
flight schedule would allow them to enter North Korea only 
toward the weekend, which would come after the IAEA board 
meeting closes. 
  Then why the delay? Analysts here offer various reasons. 
  First, some say North Korean supreme leader Kim Il-song took 
over the nuclear negotiations from his son and heir-apparent, 
Kim Chong-il. Confusion arose from this change, as attested by 
North Korean officials in New York and at the truce village of 
Panmunjom who were apparently left in the dark about Pyongyang's 
decision to accept IAEA inspections. 
  Even Ho Chong, North Korean deputy chief of mission to the 
United Nations and representative at working-level contacts with 
U.S. officials, was unaware of the decision. 
  North Korean military officials recently contacted at 
Panmunjom didn't even know their government had invited U.S. 
representative Ronald Dellums to visit, according to sources in 
the Military Armistice Commission (MAC). Dellums, who was to 
arrive in North Korea last week, was known to have cancelled his 
plans when Pyongyang failed to issue a visa at the last minute, 
without giving any reason. North Korean negotiators recently 
asked the U.S. side to present its demands on paper, an 
uncommon practice. 
  The analysts say a new situation has developed in North 
Korea, requiring that all reports to superiors be made on paper 
instead of verbally as had been the case, backing up their 
theory of confusion in the hierarchy. 
  Others say all the delay is due to a much simpler reason -- 
North Korea was "on vacation" to celebrate Kim Chong-il's 
birthday Feb. 16. The entire nation kow-towed for three days for 
the junior Kim's birthday last year, and all administrative 
affairs were frozen during the period. This year is no 
exception, they say, and visas for the IAEA inspectors will be 
issued as soon as the regular workweek begins next Monday.

  [Text] Vienna, Feb. 21 (YONHAP) -- The International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says it hopes to inspect two 
unreported nuclear facilities in North Korea in addition to 
seven reported sites at Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang. IAEA 
Director-General Hans Blix expressed the hope in an opening 
speech Monday at the Board of Governors' meeting. Blix made it 
clear that the upcoming IAEA inspection would be limited to 
checking the seven reported facilities only once and to 
confirming that North Korea has not diverted nuclear material. 
  The IAEA Board of Governors, meanwhile, decided to take up 
the North Korean nuclear issue on Wednesday [23 February], the 
last day of its three-day meeting. The decision came moments 
after North Korea sent a telegram informing the IAEA secretariat 
that it would issue visas for members of an IAEA inspection team 
after seeing the outcome of its talks with the United States, 
held in New York early this week. 
  The North Koreans thus appeared to have erected yet another 
barrier to IAEA inspections. Blix told Pyongyang last week that 
the IAEA was ready to send inspectors whenever North Korea 
issued visas for them. North Korea sent a three-member 
delegation to the Board of Governors' meeting including Kim 
Su-kil, a Foreign Ministry official at the ambassadorial level. 
  "(North Korea's) acceptance of inspections resulted from a 
North Korea-U.S. agreement," Kim said. The issuance of visas 
for the inspection team would be linked to corresponding 
measures the United States has promised to take, Kim said. 
  As a result, the IAEA inspection team could arrive in 
Pyongyang on Saturday [26 February] at the earliest, if the 
U.S.-North Korea contact proceeded smoothly.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Sincere N.K. Follow-up steps"] </F>
  [Text] It is certainly a welcome turn of affairs that 
Pyongyang has at long last found itself obliged to abide by the 
rules of the international community. After nerve-wrecking 
months of dickering and bickering with the United States and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], North Korea decided 
to open some of its nuclear facilities to international 
inspectors -- just a few days before the IAEA was to convene its 
general meeting to decide whether it should refer the North 
Korean nuclear issue to the Security Council of the United 
Nations. 
  Although the North Korean stance in this regard is still 
clouded in ambiguity, it is our sincere wish that the 
to-be-resumed inspection will help Pyongyang shed the infamy 
earned in the international community for its obstinate 
obsession with nuclear armament and other unsavory behavior. 
The North Korean decision to remain within the framework of the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), if accompanied by 
necessary deeds including reopening of the now-deadlocked 
dialogue with Seoul, can surely clear stumbling blocks for 
Pyongyang to progress in talks with the United States and Japan 
toward rapprochement. 
  All is not settled with the decision alone, however. What is 
important, and perhaps more crucial, is how sincerely Pyongyang 
abides by the terms of the NPT. North Korea must act without 
intentional procrastination while abiding faithfully by all 
provisions of the NPT, and readily and honestly submit its 
nuclear installations to international inspections including 
those, for example, in the suspected Yongbyon and other areas. 
  The Pyongyang regime is advised to accept IAEA inspections 
as 
soon as possible so as not to arouse unnecessary suspicion 
unless it has an ulterior motive for lingering. Surely, the 
sooner the better for the North if it is really interested in 
obtaining the confidence required to salvage its faltering 
economy. It should waste no time in issuing visas to IAEA 
inspectors who are all packed and ready to travel. 
  Regrettably, North Korea has so far rejected Seoul's 
repeated 
calls for mutual inspections of suspected sites in both Koreas. 
An early conduct of such trial inspections would certainly 
relieve Pyongyang of any suspicions that might arise in the 
course of implementing procedural steps. The inter-Korea 
inspections, based on the denuclearization declaration of the 
Korean Peninsula, will be an important step that can, if 
followed up by action, lead Pyongyang to gain international 
trust badly needed for its viability. 
  Now that it has decided to allow IAEA inspectors into its 
nuclear facilities, North Korea has no option but to sincerely, 
and more importantly, quickly, implement required measures. It 
would be folly for North Korea to remain under suspicion simply 
by fumbling with excuses. There will be no way to conceal 
Pyongyang's ulterior nuclear intentions, if any.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 19 (YONHAP) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton on Friday assured visiting South Korean Foreign Minister 
Han Sung-chu that there will be no high-level talks between 
Washington and Pyongyang unless there is an exchange of special 
envoys by the two Koreas. 
  Saying he was happy to receive a personal letter from Korean 
President Kim Yong-sam, Clinton stressed the importance of 
inter-Korean dialogue and cooperation between Seoul and 
Washington in resolving the North Korean nuclear problem, 
according to Korean envoy on nuclear affairs Kim Sam-hun. 
  The U.S. President said he looked forward to meeting 
President Kim at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
summit slated for Jakarta, Indonesia, in November. 
  Han, delivering a verbal message from Kim, said Seoul 
welcomed Pyongyang's acceptance of International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) inspections, but noted it was just the first step 
toward a resolution and Seoul thus wished to continue close 
cooperation with Washington. 
  Kim was quoted as saying that because of Pyongyang's 
unpredictability given past experience with the communist 
regime, South Korea and the United States should tread 
cautiously in dealing with North Korea. Kim also stressed that 
Seoul and Washington will abide by the principles -- 
implementation of IAEA inspections and exchange of presidential 
envoys between South and North Korea -- that are prerequisites 
to a third round of North Korea-U.S. high-level talks as agreed 
at a summit last November in Washington. 
  Clinton reportedly responded to Kim's personal letter 
delivered last week by reaffirming the initial Seoul-Washington 
agreement on thorough and broad settlement of the North Korean 
nuclear problem. 
  Han tried to schedule a meeting with Clinton during his Feb. 
10- 11 stay in Washington before visiting Canada to personally 
deliver Kim's letter, but failed due to the Washington-Tokyo 
summit. 
  The foreign minister made a second stop in Washington to 
coordinate further efforts on the nuclear problem following 
North Korea's acceptance of IAEA inspections. He headed for 
Seoul after his meeting with Clinton.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 19 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's 
opposition Democratic Party [DP] on Saturday delivered to U.S. 
President Bill Clinton a message calling for peaceful resolution 
of the North Korean nuclear question. The message, signed by 
party head Yi Ki-taek, was handed to State Department officials 
by party Reps. Chong Tae-chol and Cho Sun-sung for delivery to 
the White House. The two DP solons were here attending the 
Korea-U.S. 21st Century Committee. 
  The message expressed the hope that the U.S. Administration 
will handle the nuclear issue with patience, saying that the 
party is opposed to any sanction against North Korea that may 
build up tension on the Korean peninsula. Also emphasizing the 
particular importance of agriculture in Korea, the letter asked 
Washington to reconsider the question of opening Korea's farm 
and fishery goods market.

<F P=106> [YONHAP "summary" of an interview with Foreign Minister Han </F>
Sung-chu by unidentified ROK correspondents based in Washington 
on 17 February] 
  [Text] Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, who is visiting the 
United States, said in an interview with ROK correspondents 
based in Washington on 17 February: "Today I had important 
talks with Mickey Kantor, secretary of the Office of the United 
States Trade Representative; Spero, undersecretary of State for 
economic affairs; Tarnoff, undersecretary of State for political 
affairs; Assistant Secretary of State Gallucci; and Assistant 
Secretary of State Winston Lord. We exchanged views on ironing 
out opinions to prepare for the third round of talks between the 
United States and North Korea and also on South-North dialogue." 
The following is a summary of the interview: 
  [Reporter] Will the nuclear inspection have to be completed 
before the third round of talks between North Korea and the 
United States is held? 
  [Han Sung-chu] Yes. 
  [Reporter] Did the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
side make compromises to some degree? 
  [Han] No. North Korea accepted all necessary measures in 
guaranteeing the continuity of safeguards. The special 
[tukbyol] inspection issue will be dealt with at the third round 
of talks. 
  [Reporter] Even though North Korea accepted the nuclear 
inspection, has the situation not turned back to that of last 
March? 
  [Han] The situation has not changed greatly since last 
March. 
However, at that time the situation then was worsening while 
currently the situation is improving to some degree. I believe 
that the past situation will not be repeated. 
  [Reporter] What is your view on the issue of deploying 
Patriot missiles and the issue of suspending the Team Spirit 
exercise? 
  [Han] The issue of suspending the Team Spirit exercise will 
be ironed out when North Korea receives the inspection and the 
South-North dialogue is resumed. The United States and the ROK 
agreed that the issue of deploying the Patriot missiles will not 
be discussed until the IAEA holds its Board of Governors 
meeting. The military needs for the two countries will be 
examined. 
  [Reporter] Is there not a dispute between the ROK and the 
United States regarding this matter? 
  [Han] It is a fact that the United States positively 
examined the request by the commander of the U.S. Forces in the 
ROK for the Patriot missiles. Since North Korea accepted the 
nuclear inspection, it is not known whether Commander Gary Luck 
will make the same request or take measures that will be in 
harmony with our side's military assessment. The deployment 
itself has not been decided upon yet. 
  [Reporter] When do you think that South-North dialogue will 
be carried out? 
  [Han] There is a great possibility that North Korea will 
respond to the dialogue. There is a possibility that the 
dialogue will be held in the near future. 
  [Reporter] Which do you think was effective in the process 
of 
North Korea's accepting the nuclear inspection, dialogue or 
pressure? 
  [Han] We were not going to wait forever to hold a dialogue. 
The position of the United States and the ROK from the beginning 
was to depend on another method if it became impossible to 
resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue. North Korea did not 
change its mind on accepting nuclear inspection but it was a 
measure it had been planning to take in advance. 
  [Reporter] Are rumors that Kim Chong-il was in an accident a 
false report? 
  [Han] There were such rumors but it has not been confirmed. 
I believe that such rumors were spread because he did not 
attend his birthday celebrations. 
  [Reporter] Please tell us about your dialogue with Secretary 
Kantor. 
  [Han] I clearly told him that the rumors that those who 
bought foreign-made cars would be subjected to a tax 
investigation are not true. In connection with the issue of 
protecting intellectual property, there is great possibility 
that Korea is excluded from the priority watch country list on 
intellectual property violations. The plan to expand NAFTA is 
being examined by various countries, including the United 
States. The establishment of relations with NAFTA is being 
analyzed from various angles, such as that of an associate 
membership, rather than selecting one alternative. It seems 
that its framework will be revealed sometime in the middle of 
this year.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 20 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu said on Saturday evening he believes there would be no 
backdown by North Korea from their earlier acceptance of 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection of their 
nuclear facilities though Pyongyang was delaying visa issuance 
to IAEA inspectors. 
  On return home from his trip to Washington and Ottawa, 
Minister Han said delay in visa issuance seems to be part of 
Pyongyang's effort to obtain clearer steps regarding their 
agreement with the United States over the nuclear issue. Han 
said in an airport press conference that if North Korea refuses 
to issue visa to IAEA inspectors to the end, there would be due 
actions from IAEA and the United Nations. 
  Minister Han said the upcoming IAEA inspection would 
definitely include taking sample materials, but there would be 
no exchange of fuel bars. "If and when any fuel bars are 
exchanged in North Korean nuclear facilities in the days to 
come, IAEA should always take part," he said. Even if North 
Korea were found to already possess nuclear materials, what is 
more important is to obtain Pyongyang's nuclear transparency and 
keep them from using such materials in producing nuclear weapons 
than to take sanction, he said. 
  Han observed the third-round high-level U.S.-North Korea 
talks could be held around the end of March at the earliest 
because he said it would take about four weeks to analyze the 
outcome of the planned IAEA look into North Korean facilities. 
  The foreign minister was optimistic about North Korea's 
return to the stalled inter-Korean dialogue. "Since the 
resumption of dialogue is linked to the third-round 
Washington-Pyongyang talks and the suspension of the Team Spirit 
exercise, I believe North Korea would agree to resumed 
dialogue," he said. 
  Regarding the controversial Patriots missile issue, he said 
South Korea and the United States will discuss the matter upon 
the end of the IAEA Board of Governors meeting opening on Feb. 
21. "The discussion will cover detailed issues including the 
question of whether to deploy the anti-missile missiles in 
Korea," Minister Han said.

  [Text] In a meeting with reporters at the Kimpo 
International Airport on 19 February after returning from the 
United States and Canada, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said 
that "North Korea has not issued visas for the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection team. However, it will 
likely issue them during the time the IAEA Board of Governors 
meeting is held--the meeting begins on 21 February--so that the 
inspection team begins its activities." 
  Minister Han also stated that "North Korea is delaying the 
issuance of visas because it needs to clarify the procedures of 
the agreement it reached with the United States during a 
working-level contact last 29 December." 
  Minister Han said he understands that "the scope of 
inspection agreed between North Korea and the IAEA includes the 
extraction of sample materials from the five-megawatt atomic 
reactor, and this means that North Korea fully accepted the 
scope of inspection demanded by the IAEA in the past." 
  He pointed out that IAEA's inspection activities and 
analysis 
of the inspection results would require about four weeks. 
Therefore, in the event that the inspection begins next week and 
proceeds satisfactorily, the third round of high-level 
U.S.-North Korea talks would be resumed in late March. 
  Since the exchange of special envoys between the North and 
the South is a precondition for the third round of high-level 
U.S.-North Korea talks, the talks on this issue will be held 
before late March. 
  Commenting on the report that there is difference in views 
between the ROK and the United States on the deployment of 
Patriot missiles, Minister Han said that "in view of the 
sensitive time of the nuclear negotiations, the ROK and the 
United States agreed to withhold the decision on deployment 
until the IAEA Board of Governors meeting is held." He added 
that "the two nations will consult the issue of deployment and 
time by taking into account the judgment of commander of U.S. 
Forces in the ROK and changes in the situation." 
  Minister Han pointed out that "if North Korea possesses 
nuclear materials, the detection of their exact amount and 
location is important. If sanctions against North Korea are 
pushed because it possesses nuclear materials alone, North Korea 
will not allow anyone to confirm the contents of the nuclear 
materials it possesses. Therefore, sanctions under this 
condition are not desirable."

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong by </F>
Hwang Chae-hong, second director of the TONG-A ILBO Political 
Department, in Seoul on 17 February] 
  [Excerpts] [Hwang Chae-hong] It is fortunate that a 
crisis [paguk] on the North Korean nuclear issue was avoided. 
Why do you think North Korea changed its attitude and decided 
to allow nuclear inspections right before plans to refer it to 
the UN Security Council? 
  [Hong Sun-yong] There are various opinions regarding North 
Korea's intentions. I would like to assess positively 
[kungjongjoguro pyongga] North Korea's intentions. In my 
opinion, North Korea did not allow nuclear inspections for many 
reasons, but it finally recognized the fact that it could not 
avoid isolation as an outlaw by the international community if 
it continued to refuse international inspections. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Hwang] The government has insisted on resolving the North 
Korean nuclear issue in a peaceful way through dialogue. Is 
there any special reason for the government to carry on with 
this strategy? 
  [Hong] Our emphasis on a policy of dialogue was based on the 
possibility of sanctions by the international community. We 
have pursued a carrot-and-stick policy, and the carrot side has 
just borne fruit. 
  [Hwang] In any case, has the government stressed the 
dialogue policy because it realized the possibility of changes 
in North Korea's attitude through a secret South-North dialogue 
channel? 
  [Hong] There is no secret dialogue channel. Under the 
current situation, in which South and North Korea mistrust each 
other, it is highly possible that communication through any 
secret channel will just amplify the mutual misunderstanding. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Hwang] Some people criticize that the United States assumed 
a leadership role in the nuclear negotiations while we, a party 
directly concerned, played a supporting role. What is your 
opinion? 
  [Hong] The suspicion about North Korea's nuclear development 
is an important matter that not only directly relates to peace 
and security of the Korean peninsula, but also is considered a 
challenge to the international order based on the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty. Therefore, the United States stepped 
forward and played an important role. We should admit the U.S. 
role. [passage omitted] 
  [Hwang] The ROK and the United States said they would 
suspend the Team Spirit exercise this year if North Korea allows 
nuclear inspections. When will they announce the suspension of 
the exercise? 
  [Hong] They will express their willingness for a conditional 
suspension when the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
inspection team enters North Korea, and will make a final 
decision when the IAEA inspection is successfully conducted and 
when progress is made in South-North dialogue. [passage omitted] 
  [Hwang] What are the prospects for South-North dialogue, 
which is likely to be resumed in the near future? 
  [Hong] As North Korea agreed to make meaningful progress in 
South-North dialogue before the third round of U.S.-North Korean 
talks, South and North Korea will hold working-level contacts, 
which were severed October 1993. The government position is 
that the South-North envoy exchange is another precondition for 
the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks. [passage omitted] 
  [Hwang] People are concerned about the fact that North Korea 
has adhered only to dialogue with the United States, while it 
has just formally acceded to South-North dialogue. 
  [Hong] North Korea's attitude is unpredictable. It is not 
probable, however, that the United States trusts North Korea and 
will promote improvement of relations under the situation, in 
which South Korea does not trust North Korea. The shortest way 
to Washington is through Seoul. [passage omitted] 
  [Hwang] There is a view that the refusal of strong countries 
to allow developing countries to possess nuclear weapons is 
wrong. 
  [Hong] In my opinion, it is more important now to increase 
nuclear transparency. It is undesirable to attempt to have 
nuclear reprocessing facilities to achieve peace and security on 
the Korean peninsula. In the present situation, nuclear 
reprocessing facilities are not economical. [passage omitted] 
  [Hwang] What is your opinion on the possibility of holding 
South-North summit talks? 
  [Hong] Building mutual confidence between South and North 
Korea by accepting the principle of peaceful coexistence first 
is more important than arguing when to hold the summit talks. 
  [Hwang] It is reasonable to hold the summit when conditions 
are met. Is it possible, however, that the top leaders of South 
and North Korea will meet first to reach some important 
agreements, which can be implemented on a working level? 
  [Hong] That is theoretically possible. It would be nothing 
but a temporary unity [ponghap] or a compromise [tahyop] for the 
top leaders, who have different senses of value and systems, to 
hold talks. From a long-term viewpoint, it would not be of much 
help for the reunification of the country. [passage omitted]

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
editorials from 19 February ROK vernacular newspapers on the 
government's attitude toward North Korea regarding the nuclear 
issue. 
  The moderate Seoul HANGUK ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 
a 800-word editorial entitled "Lessons Two Years After the 
North-South Agreement." The editorial reports "it is natural 
that the government has set the exchange of special envoys as a 
precondition for U.S.-North Korean talks," referring to the 
government's decision to announce the conditional suspension of 
the Team Spirit exercise when the exchange, as well as 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections, are made. 
The editorial suggests that North Korea may use the exchange of 
special envoys to approach the United States. 
  The editorial notes that North Korea was not interested in 
implementing the 4 July North-South joint statement and the 19 
December North-South basic agreement. Noting North Korea's 
insincere and capricious attitude toward South Korea, the 
editorial indicates "it is regrettable that the government 
assumes an ambiguous position toward North Korea's nuclear 
issue." 
  The editorial concludes that "the government must make North 
Korea aware that the Team Spirit exercise will be suspended and 
that the third U.S.-North Korean talks may be possible only if 
practical dialogues -- such as the discussion of simultaneous 
inspection of the North and South, the holding of summit talks, 
and exchange and cooperation between the North and South -- are 
held through the exchange of special envoys." 
  The moderate Seoul KYONGHYANG SINMUN in Korean publishes on 
page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "Where Is the Spirit of 
Agreement?" Referring to the significance and background of the 
North-South agreement and to the government's effort to 
implement it, the editorial reports that the South has allowed 
Yi In-mo to reunite with his family in the North and that it has 
proposed to the North side to establish a location in Panmunjom 
where separated family members can meet. 
  The editorial adds that North Korea should respond to the 
North- South dialogue and the exchange of special envoys if it 
decides to accept the nuclear inspections. 
  The left-leaning Seoul HANGYORE SINMUN in Korean publishes 
on 
page 3 an 1,000-word editorial entitled "The Government Must 
Exercise its Right to Participate in Resolving the Nuclear 
Issue." The editorial notes that "in a meeting of 
unification-related ministries on 17 February, the government 
decided to respond to North Korea's acceptance of IAEA nuclear 
inspections." The editorial reports this decision eased the 
people's worry about the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  The editorial stresses that the government is very 
interested 
in realizing the exchange of special envoys, referring to 
President Kim Yong-sam's letter to U.S. President Clinton 
emphasizing the importance of progress in the North-South 
dialogue for the complete settlement of the nuclear issue. 
  Noting the possibility of North Korea's active participation 
in the future North-South dialogue to realize the third 
U.S.-North Korean talks, the editorial reports that "the 
government should exercise its right to participate in an issue 
related to the fate of the nation, such as the North Korean 
nuclear issue." 
  The independent moderate Seoul MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN in 
Korean 
publishes on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "The 
Government's Ability To Deal With the Korean Peninsula Issue." 
The editorial notes that the government should properly 
formulate a reunification policy in view of the recent changes 
in the international community and the complicated situation 
surrounding the Korean peninsula. 
  Noting the people's attention to the government's 
reunification policy, the editorial reports that the North and 
South are the parties concerned in the reunification issue, even 
though they need cooperation from the United States and Japan. 
  The editorial concludes that economic cooperation will 
hasten 
national reunification and points out the need to make plans for 
economic cooperation.

<F P=106> [Kim Cha-ung from the UN Headquarters] </F>
  [Text] Ho Chong, deputy chief of the North Korean Mission 
to the United Nations, who had served as the North Korean 
representative to the U.S.-North Korea contact on the North 
Korean nuclear issue, has been relieved of his post abruptly. A 
noteworthy speculation circulating in the UN diplomatic circles 
is that he has been relieved of his position after being 
reprimanded for his mistaken report to Pyongyang on the results 
of the New York working-level contact which took place toward 
the end of 1993 and in which the United States and North Korea 
agreed on nuclear inspections. 
  Deputy Chief of Mission Ho's departure from his post was 
confirmed approximately a week ago when Western intelligence 
agencies found out that he reserved a seat on a China Airlines 
[as published] flight -- that leaves New York on 24 February -- 
to go to Pyongyang via Beijing. The North Korean mission 
refused to confirm this report over the telephone, and finally, 
on 19 February, a mission official concerned confirmed his 
departure for Pyongyang. When asked why Ho Chong would depart 
for Pyongyang, he said he "is not in a position to comment." It 
has been learned Deputy Chief of Mission Ho is now preparing for 
his return home after concluding his official duties. His last 
official duty was reported to be his 15 February contact with 
his U.S. counterpart to discuss measures to be taken to follow 
up North Korea's acceptance of nuclear inspections. 
  This year is his fifth year at the United Nations. He was 
originally scheduled to leave for Pyongyang early last year when 
his term expired. 
  Therefore, it is speculated his departure results from a 
mere 
change of hands. Still, the speculation that he is departing 
after being reprimanded has become more convincing. 
  This speculation goes like this: He was reprimanded for his 
distorted report to Pyongyang on the results of the New York 
working-level contact. At that contact, the United States and 
North Korea agreed to hold the third stage of U.S.-North Korea 
high-level talks under the condition that North Korea allows the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] to inspect all 
facilities to the extent that North Korea ensures that 
continuity of nuclear safeguards and that North-South dialogue 
for the exchange of special envoys resumes. However, when 
notifying Pyongyang of the results of the negotiations, Deputy 
Chief of Mission Ho reportedly stated that the agreement between 
North Korea and the United States requires North Korea to 
receive not full-scope inspections [chonmyon sachal] of the 
seven reported nuclear facilities but restricted inspections 
[chehanjok sachal] of facilities it wants to open to the extent 
that North Korea ensures the continuity of nuclear safeguards. 
  Because of Ho Chong's notification, North Korea reportedly 
underwent significant confusion and internal trouble before it 
announced it would accept nuclear inspections. North Korea's 
insistence on restricted inspections during its negotiations 
with the IAEA is an example. 
  The analysis of the diplomatic circles in the United Nations 
goes like this: In further contact with the United States, 
North Korea realized that Ho Chong's report was wrong. 
Therefore, North Korea, at a last phase, notified the IAEA that 
it would accept full-scope inspections of the seven nuclear 
facilities. 
  During a meeting with domestic reporters in New York on 16 
February, ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said: "One of the 
reasons North Korea had been stubborn before it announced it 
would accept nuclear inspections this time is the structural 
problem in communications between Ho Chong, Kang Sok-chu, and 
other working-level officials in charge of the nuclear issue and 
Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il." 
  He also said: "Working-level officials in charge of 
negotiations seem to worry that they may be reproached for not 
making efforts to the end but making concessions to the United 
States." 
  Those remarks by Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu is more proof 
of Deputy Chief of Mission Ho's mistaken report.

<F P=106> [By Yi Kang-tok from the Integrated Government Building in </F>
Seoul] 
  [Text] A government official said that right after the next 
U.S.-North Korean working-level contact--likely to be held 
tonight in New York--the government will propose to North Korea 
holding a South-North working-level contact for the exchange of 
special envoys. 
  He said: The government expected that North Korea would 
suggest that we hold a dialogue first. However, as North Korea 
demanded through a news conference held by its Foreign Ministry 
spokesman yesterday, that our side propose first that South and 
North Korea hold a contact for the exchange of special envoys, 
the government has decided to make such a proposal first. 
Accordingly, the government will hold a meeting of offices 
concerned to decide on a date for the South-North working-level 
contact. It is now considering a method for holding a 
working-level contact with North Korea next week. 
  According to the government, in the forthcoming U.S.-North 
Korean working-level contact in New York, the United States will 
state, in particular, when to hold the third round of U.S.-North 
Korean talks and will announce the conditional suspension of the 
Team Spirit exercise, meeting North Korea's demands without a 
snag. North Korea is also expected to give an available date 
for the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection 
team's entrance to North Korea. 
  The government anticipated: There is no big problem for the 
IAEA inspection team to enter North Korea next week. 
Accordingly, South-North working-level contacts will begin 
sometime next week without problem according to our proposal 
because the South-North dialogue must begin upon the inspection 
team's entrance to North Korea. South and North Korea held 
three working-level contacts for the exchange of special envoys 
last year, and have held no more contacts since then because of 
North Korea's refusal.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Kim Kyo-man: "Discord Between the </F>
National Unification Board (NUB) and the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs Regarding a North Korean Policy"] 
  [Text] Discord between the governmental ministries in 
charge of North Korean policy have been recently disclosed since 
North Korea accepted the nuclear inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. In particular, the 
National Unification Board and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
have greatly different views on the following issues: The 
importance of North-South dialogue regarding the third DPRK-U.S. 
talks, the form of the North- South dialogue, the announcement 
date for the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise, and the 
government's attitude regarding public relations. 
  In the 18 February seminar to greet the 2d anniversary of 
the 
effectuation of the "North-South Basic Agreement," Yi Yong-tok, 
deputy prime minister and chairman of the national unification 
board, stressed that "the third DPRK-U.S. talks would be held 
only if there is significant progress in North-South dialogue," 
and that "through an exchange of special envoys, in particular, 
North Korea should discuss the following issues, such as its 
return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, its resumption of 
ad hoc [imsi] or ordinary [tongsang] inspections by the IAEA, 
and the simultaneous inspections of the North and South." 
  Before returning to Seoul after he visited the United 
States, 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said, however, that "we cannot 
deny the importance of North-South dialogue, but it may be 
unhelpful to the settlement of the issues pending between the 
North and South in the light of the settlement of the North 
Korean nuclear issue." 
  The two ministers have the same opinions regarding the 
importance of North-South dialogue. However, Foreign Minister 
Han has stressed that the settlement of the nuclear issue can be 
delayed if we attach too much importance to progress in the 
North-South dialogue, while Deputy Prime Minister Yi has said 
that a certain progress must be made in the North-South dialogue 
to resolve it. 
  Regarding the resumption of the North-South dialogue, they 
also have a different view on the form of dialogue. Song 
Yong-tae, vice minister of the National Unification Board, 
stressed in his 17 February news interview with reporters that 
"the North-South dialogue must be carried out in the form of the 
exchange of special envoys." 
  While he was in Canada, Foreign Minister Han said that "he 
would not care if the North-South dialogue is carried out in the 
form of the exchange of special envoys, or in the form of a 
meeting of the North-South Joint Nuclear Control Committee, or 
in the form of the North-South high-level talks, if they are 
intended to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue." 
  They have also different views of the announcement date of 
the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise. In a Television 
interview on the morning of 20 February, Vice Foreign Minister 
Hong Sung-yong has set the concrete date for the conditional 
suspension of the Team Spirit exercise by saying that "the 
government would announce the conditional suspension of the Team 
Spirit exercise at the time of the IAEA inspection team members' 
arrival in North Korea and when the North and South resume their 
working-level contact for the exchange of special envoys." 
  However, Deputy Prime Minister Yi said on 18 February that 
"the conditional suspension of the Team Spirit exercise will be 
determined depending on the result of the IAEA's inspection and 
the progress in the North-South dialogue for the exchange of 
special envoys." 
  The attitude shown by the National Unification Board and the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs since North Korea has accepted the 
nuclear inspections is very comparative. On the morning of 16 
February -- the day the fact that North Korea accepted the 
nuclear inspections was disclosed -- Vice Foreign Minister Hong 
expressed the government's position on future policy direction 
along with the detailed explanation of the process of nuclear 
negotiations. 
  On the other hand, relevant responsible officials of the 
National Unification Board did not express official commentary 
regarding its position that day. It has been confirmed that a 
relevant high-level official instructed them not to do so. 
Although the fact that "a meeting on unification-related 
strategy" was held on the morning of 17 February chaired by 
Deputy Prime Minister Yi was disclosed by other ministries, the 
National Unification Board has continued its secret 
administrative business by saying that "it has never heard it." 
  Depending on the progress in the settlement of the North 
Korean nuclear issue, the different views of the issues between 
the National Unification Board and the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs are likely to be catalysts in creating discord between 
the governmental ministries in charge of the issues of the 
unification, security, national defense, and foreign diplomacy.

<F P=106> [Article by Kim Chun-pom: "The Security Affairs-Related </F>
Ministries Are Not Working Cooperatively"] 
  [Text] Some question whether there is a loophole in the 
government's system to deal with a crisis because the national 
security affairs-related ministries, such as the National 
Unification, Foreign, and National Defense Ministries, are not 
working cooperatively on the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  Noteworthy examples are the talks between ROK Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu and U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry, 
the issue regarding the deployment of Patriot missiles to the 
Korean peninsula, and the timing of the announcement on the 
suspension of Team Spirit exercise. 
  The government on 8 February held a security affairs-related 
ministers meeting chaired by President Kim Yong-sam and 
discussed ways to relieve "the rumors on the crisis on the 
Korean peninsula" and the government's follow-up measures in 
case North Korea's nuclear issue is referred to the UN Security 
Council. 
  The meeting was this year's first security affairs-related 
ministers meeting to be presided over by President Kim and was 
attended by Premier Yi Hoe-chang, Unification Minister Yi 
Yong-duk, the ministers of foreign affairs and national defense, 
the director of the Agency for National Security Planning, and 
the senior secretary of Chongwadae [presidential office]. 
  Following the meeting, Foreign Minister Han on 9 February 
hurriedly departed for the United States seven days earlier than 
planned. On 11 February, he met U.S. Defense Secretary Perry in 
Washington and, during the meeting, made clear that a crisis is 
not looming on the Korean peninsula, as the U.S. media has been 
reporting. 
  Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae, however, did not knew about 
the Han-Perry meeting in advance. The Ministry of National 
Defense [MDN], after learning about the meeting via foreign 
reports, expressed its regret over the Foreign Ministry's 
failure to inform the MDN of the meeting. 
  A high-level MDN official conceded: "Although Foreign 
Minister Han sat right beside Minister Yi during the security 
affairs-related ministers meeting held at Chongwadae, he did not 
utter a word about his plan to meet Perry. This shows that 
there is a large loophole in the cooperative system among 
ministries." 
  Even though the MDN can get access to information on the 
Han-Perry contacts through various channels as a Foreign 
Ministry official is stationed at the MDN and a military attache 
resides at the ROK Embassy in the United States, the MDN has not 
acquired any information on the contacts. 
  Regarding the deployment of the Patriot missiles, even 
though 
the U.S. assistant to President Clinton for National Security 
Affairs had conferred over the phone with Chong Chong-ku, senior 
secretary for Foreign and National Security Affairs, the Defense 
Ministry became aware of the fact when the Foreign Ministry 
later officially announced that "the deployment of the Patriot 
missiles to the Korean peninsula is now under review." 
  The MDN expressed concern about the team work of the 
security 
affairs-related ministries by saying that: "There has never been 
a case in which an important military issue has been pushed 
ahead without prior consultations with the MDN." 
  On 16 February, even after North Korea's acceptance of 
inspections on its nuclear facilities was announced, a 
difference of opinion among the ministries was clearly revealed. 
  The MDN, which restrained from commenting officially on the 
issue regarding the Team Spirit exercise, unofficially expressed 
a prudent stance on the afternoon of 16 February by saying that: 
"The announcement on calling off the Team Spirit exercise will 
be made around 10 March at the earliest and, furthermore, the 
time is not right to announce the issue officially." 
  On the next day, however, a National Unification Board 
official announced: "With North Korea's acceptance of 
International Atomic Energy Agency inspections, the suspension 
of the Team Spirit exercise will be announced next week." 
  Even when the National Unification Board made such an 
announcement, the MDN adhered to its position that was revealed 
the day before and did not reveal if the National Unification 
Board's announcement had been discussed among the relevant 
ministries. 
  Some military experts, commenting on such differences in 
opinion among the ministries, point out that the fundamental 
problem lies in the fact that the national security affairs 
ministries have been slightly neglected since the new government 
took office.

  [Text] New York, Feb. 18 KYODO -- North Korea's top 
diplomatic official denied speculation Friday [18 February] that 
Kim Chong-il, son and heir apparent to the communist country's 
President Kim Il-song, has been seriously injured. Pak Kil-yon, 
North Korean ambassador to the United Nations, told KYODO NEWS 
SERVICE that the speculation was based on groundless rumors and 
Kim celebrated his 52nd birthday Wednesday in good spirit. 
  In a Seoul-datelined story Thursday, a foreign news agency 
quoted South Korea's opposition Democratic Party Leader Li 
Ki-taek as saying that he had heard from foreign diplomatic 
sources that Kim Chong-il had sustained serious, but 
unspecified, injuries. Li was told that if Kim did not appear 
at celebrations marking his 52nd birthday Wednesday, the reports 
could be considered "reliable." Pak said the reports were 
political propaganda designed to slander Kim, the No. 2 man in 
Pyongyang's ruling hierarchy.

more than 100 of them seek to come to South Korea, a government 
official said on Sunday. South Korea, however, cannot accept 
them because of the position of North Korea and Russia, said the 
official, adding that therefore the government is considering 
other steps to cope with them, such as turning to the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees (HCR). 
  "Many of those North Korean loggers who escaped Siberia 
logging yards had come in contact with the South Korean Embassy 
in Moscow and Consulate General in Vladivostok for permission to 
enter South Korea," he said. Those who contacted South Korean 
missions in Russia reached 100 to 150 so far, he said. 
  The official said there are 16,000 to 20,000 North Korean 
loggers in Pyongyang-run logging yards in Siberia, and hundreds 
of them are known to have escaped the logging yards and been 
roaming through Russia. He said that if Seoul accepted them, it 
is apt to offend North Korea and that Russia, too, is not 
interested in sending them to South Korea because of its 
relations with North Korea. 
  "At the moment, the government is asking Russia to recognize 
the escapees as international refugees and ensure their safety 
and basic rights," the official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 19 (YONHAP) -- China has recently 
disclosed that North Korea may already possess one or more 
nuclear bombs, the JIJI news agency reported in a dispatch from 
Washington on Saturday. Beijing has in the past opposed 
Pyongyang's acquisition of nuclear arms. Quoting a U.S. 
military source, JIJI said the United States had on many 
occasions contacted China, a staunch ally of North Korea, to 
determine whether Pyongyang possessed nuclear weapons. The 
answer from China had always been negative on such a 
possibility, the report said. 
  JIJI said the American source based his view on North 
Korea's 
arsenal on information obtained from China in the recent past. 
When a U.S. War College delegation called at the Chinese 
defense college during a visit to Beijing last January, Chinese 
officials said, "North Korea may already possess nuclear arms," 
JIJI quoted the source as saying. 
  The report said the U.S. source believes that China now 
virtually recognizes that North Korea has nuclear weapons based 
on tips from Pyongyang officials during military exchanges 
between the two allies. The source added that there is no way to 
know how many nuclear bombs North Korea may now have, but the 
number could be one or two, according to the JIJI report.

  [Text] Beijing, Feb. 22 (YONHAP) -- North Korean 
ambassador to China Chu Chang-chun returned to Pyongyang in 
mid-February to consult with the Foreign Ministry on the nuclear 
problem, a diplomatic source here said Tuesday. 
  The source said that Chu went back to his country ostensibly 
to attend celebrations for the 52nd birthday of Kim Chong-il, 
son and heir-apparent of President Kim Il-song, on Feb. 16. But 
in fact, Chu was recalled by his home government to discuss 
problems related to the nuclear issue and the planned visit to 
China by South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, the source said, 
asking for anonymity. 
  "Judging by past experience, Chu will hold a press 
conference 
as soon as he returns to Beijing and discuss North Korea's 
position on pending issues," the source said. 
  If the ambassador does so, part of North Korea's nuclear 
strategy may be revealed, he added. 
  During Chu's absence, Pae Yong-chae, a councilor for 
political affairs at the North Korean embassy, attended a 
commemorative event for the 35th annniversary of the North 
Korea-China Cultural Cooperation Treaty held in Beijing Tuesday.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 20 (YONHAP) -- South Korea plans to 
provide 40 million U.S. dollars in an Economic Development 
Cooperation Fund (EDCF) to China this year, a government 
official said on Sunday. 
  "China last year asked Korea for 112 million dollars in 
economic cooperation. But, we have decided to furnish 40 
million dollars initially this year taking into account the 
projects the money would finance and the availability of EDCF 
funds," he said. 
  The official said the government had already completed the 
feasibility study of the projects by sending a fact-finding team 
to China toward the end of last year. The EDCF fund will help 
finance a bridge construction in Tianjin, harbor expansion at 
Longkou in Shandong Province, railroad facilities at Dongning in 
Heilongjiang Province, and airport communications and control 
facilities in Harbin, he said.

  [Text] Beijing, Feb. 22 (YONHAP) -- North Korea on Monday 
unveiled an ambitious three-phase plan to develop an 
international port and industrial complex in the 
621-square-kilometer area between Najin and Sonbong on its 
northern border, which was made a free economic zone under 
Decision No. 74 of the Administrative Council promulgated in 
December 1991. 
  The North Koreans aim to transform the Najin-Sonbong zone 
into a modern international trade center, fully equipped with 
industrial, commercial, housing and tourism facilities, 
according to a confidential document acquired by YONHAP. 
  The 40-page booklet is titled "Golden Triangle 
Najin-Sonbong" 
and was issued by the Committee for the Promotion of External 
Economic Cooperation, formed early last year under the auspices 
of the External Economic Affairs Ministry. 
  According to the three-phase plan that was initiated last 
year, the communist country will boast an international-quality 
port, roads, railways, airport, electricity, telecommunications 
and industrial facilities in the zone and expand Chongjin port 
by 2010. 
  To begin with, it will build a new 1,000-meter harbor next 
to 
the current 2,515-meter facility in Najin and add 32,399 square 
meters of storage for an annual freight capacity of 10 million 
tons in the northwestern port city by next year. 
  Between 1996 and 2000, the area's annual freight capacity 
will be increased to 20 million tons, with another 3,500-meter 
harbor to accommodate freighters up to 200,000 tons as well as 
500,000 square meters of storage. 
  By 2010, it will be equipped with a terminal capable of 
handling 40 million tons of cargo and also house 36 freighters 
weighing 20,000 to 200,000 tons. 
  Sonbong port will have an annual freight capacity of 10 
million tons by then while Chongjin port is refurnished to 
support the international role of Najin and Sonbong. 
  The 168-kilometer Hoeryong-Haksong railway will be 
duplicated 
and tracks linking Najin to Kuryonpyong and Hunyong expanded. 
  Also on the drawing board is a scheme to realize North 
Korea's ambition of linking up with China and Russia. 
  Railways will be modernized and expanded to Hunchun and 
Khassan, bordering China and Russia, respectively, and 
expressways constructed to connect Hoeryong, Chongjin, Najin, 
Sonbong, Khassan (Russia), Onsong and Namyang. 
  In addition, North Korea will set up 100,000 electric 
telephone and data exchange circuits in Najin and construct an 
optical submarine cable linking Najin-Hunchun-Posyet. 
  The masterplan also includes a 300,000-kilowatt power 
station, an international airport in Sonbong and elaborate 
connections to Niigata (Japan), Vladivostok and Khabarovsk 
(Russia), and Hunchun and Jilin (China). 
  In particular, North Korea is seeking foreign investment in 
advanced technology and high value-added services in the booklet. 
  It is offering to rent a square meter of land in the 
Najin-Sonbong zone for 1.2 U.S. dollars to 3.2 dollars and is 
asking 59 dollars for land development of each square meter.

  [Text] Korea has expressed concern with the projected U.S. 
revival of Super 301 in the U.S. Trade Act, pointing out that 
the act does not comply with free trade spirit and regulations 
of GATT and the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Foreign 
Ministry said yesterday. Seoul and Washington have agreed to 
hold a working-level body to improve U.S. procedures on 
investigation of anti-dumping practices of Korean exporters, a 
ministry official said. 
  The agreement was reached at the close of three days of 
Korea-U.S. talks at the Dialogue for Economic Cooperation (DEC) 
in Washington Thursday. The two sides also reached an agreement 
to conclude a pact on exemption of social security tax on 
businessmen working in the United States. 
  The official said that the United States accepted the 
request 
by Korea it improve unfair U.S. investigation procedures in 
connection with alleged anti-dumping practices by Korean 
commodity exporters. Korean companies have suffered from 
frequent anti-dumping probes. 
  The two sides also decided to launch working-level 
negotiations to work out an agreement on exemption of social 
security tax. Korean businessmen have complained that they are 
forced to pay security tax on their income in the United States. 
  The United States has agreed to arrange a dialogue channel 
between U.S. and Korean constructors to solve the difficulties 
Koreans experience, such as non-recognition of Korean 
constructors' performance in third countries and obligatory 
deposits of excessive amount of money for construction work in 
the United States. The two sides also agreed to strengthen 
cooperation between tax administration bodies to prevent 
unreasonable imposition of taxes on Korean firms. 
  A final report on discussion of bilateral economic issues 
will be reported to a meeting of the Korea-U.S. economic 
consultative council slated for June in Washington, the official 
said.

  [Text] Korea has temporarily withheld the submission of its 
final offer list to implement the Uruguay Round [UR] of global 
trade agreement under the auspices of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade, government officials said. All 117 member 
countries of GATT that participated in the multilateral trade 
liberalization talks were supposed to present their offer lists 
by Feb. 15 based on the package conclusion reached last Dec. 15 
after seven and a half years of negotiations. Only 10 
countries, however, had met the deadline as of Friday, they said. 
  Unconfirmed reports here attributed the foot-dragging by 
other countries in presenting their country schedules to 
failures to do so by the two biggest participants -- the United 
States and Japan -- over last-minute differences on tariff 
reduction matters. Washington reportedly is calling for 
additional tariff reductions by Japan and is deliberately 
postponing the submission of its offer lists. The government 
officials, however, say all they have heard about it from the 
U.S. officials in this regard was that the heavy snow that hit 
parts of the United States has delayed the printing of the 
related documents. "We doubt the deliberate postponement of the 
list presentation by the United States because once the deal was 
made, there can be no renegotiations of the GATT round," said an 
official of the Economic Planning Board. 
  The official, apparently conscious of the assertions of some 
government critics here calling for partial renegotiations of 
the farm sector agreement, flatly denied any room for a renewed 
deal on the agreement. 
  As to why the government has not tendered its list to the 
GATT secretariat, the official said that it is because the 
government does not want to give the impression it is hurrying 
to seal the Uruguay Round deal while there are still voices of 
disagreement.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 19 (YONHAP) -- The International 
Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA), the largest intellectual 
property rights organization in the United States, has demanded 
that the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) retain South Korea on 
the priority watch list, the Korea Foreign Trade Association 
said over the weekend. 
  The IIPA has recommended that the USTR label China, Brazil 
and India as priority foreign countries for negotiations on 
unfair trade relations and retain South Korea, Japan and nine 
other countries on the priority watch list. 
  By Friday, the USTR had received industrial opinions on 
whether to invoke the Super 301 section of a 1988 trade law 
empowering him to take retaliatory steps against countries that 
fail to lower trade barriers against U.S. goods and will make 
public the opinions around next Wednesday, the association said.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 19 (YONHAP) -- To make its rice farming 
structure fit the agricultural market opening, the government 
has mapped out a comprehensive plan to cut rice costs and 
improve quality. The Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 
Ministry said Saturday it had set this year's rice output at 
5.08 million tons (37.2 million sok), down 4.6 percent from 5.35 
million tons in 1993, a bad crop year due to cool summer weather. 
  Farmland was estimated to drop 21,000 hectares to 1.11 
million hectares based on the past five-year average decrease, 
with each 300 pyong (990 square meters) producing 456 kilograms 
for this year's output quota. As a result, in view of the 1993 
provisional record of 96.9 percent, the rice self-sufficiency 
rate is expected to be under 100 percent in 1994 (estimated at 
89.1 percent) and 1995 (95.9 percent), but Korea will attain 100 
percent self-sufficiency in edible rice by 2001 The ministry 
said it had revised this year's rice policy to put quality above 
quantity in the wake of the conclusion of the Uruguay Round 
trade agreement.

  [Text] The main opposition Democratic Party's [DP] proposal 
to dismiss Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Kim 
Yang-pae was voted down in the National Assembly plenary session 
yesterday. In a secret balloting in which 276 lawmakers 
participated, it was rejected by a vote of 164 nays to 112 ayes. 
DP lawmakers made the proposal early last week, charging that 
Minister Kim insulted parliament and betrayed the nation's 6 
million farmers by failing to make proper efforts to protect the 
local rice market. In an address that preceded the voting, Rep. 
Chong Ki-ho of the DP appealed to the DLP [Democratic Liberal 
Party] lawmakers to cast "aye" votes. 
  Rep. Chong accused Minister Kim of having made little effort 
to protect the interests of farmers in connection with the 
opening of the domestic agricultural market. "Minister Kim has 
also deceived lawmakers by breaking his own promise to report to 
the parliament on the government plan to implement the Uruguay 
Round trade accord," Chong said. 
  Of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party's 172 lawmakers, 164 
were present at the voting, suggesting that all the DLP solons 
voted against the bill. Prior to the plenary session, each rival 
parties called a general meeting of its lawmakers in an effort 
to prevent possible "revolt" votes. The DLP leadership had 
worried whether some DLP lawmakers from rural constituencies 
might vote in favor of the dismissal of the agriculture minister.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 21 (YONHAP) -- Prime Minister Yi 
Hoe-chang on Monday categorically denied as "totally groundless" 
some recent foreign press reports that made the Korean situation 
look as if tension is building up. 
  "It is true North Korea has massed troops and weapons in 
areas along the truce line," said Yi. "But, this is far from 
being anything new." He emphasized that there have been no 
signs of any unusual military movement in North Korea in 
connection with the nuclear question. 
  "In fact, I am displeased at those foreign press reports 
that 
tended to describe the Korean situation as a crisis," Yi said. 
He said the basic position of the government is that the two 
Koreas should regard each other as partners in pursuit of 
coexistence and co-prosperity. 
  "However, we cannot accept North Korea as a partner only in 
a 
circumstance where they behaves as if they have nuclear arms in 
their hands and persist in trying to communize the whole 
peninsula," he said. 
  In his testimony, Deputy Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok said 
North Korea may possess plutonium enough to produce about two 
atomic bombs, but at the moment it is hard to say North Korea 
has produced nuclear weapons. 
  Yi said whether North Korea has developed nuclear arms would 
be determined once full international and inter-Korean nuclear 
inspections are implemented thoroughly. 
  Yi who is also national unification minister said the 
exchange of special envoys between South and North Korea should 
be carried out before third-round U.S.-North Korea talks take 
place. When special envoys are exchanged, the two Koreas would 
discuss the nuclear question and the issue of implementing the 
basic South-North agreement, he said. 
  Also speaking at the assembly session, Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu said that the disused Russian submarines being sold to 
foreign countries are of a kind which can be used as none but 
scrap. Of the 12 disused Russian submarines, one has been 
delivered to North Korea, said Han, adding that he understands 
Russia is planning to send a verification team to North Korea to 
witness the disintegration of the submarine sold to North Korea. 
  Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae told the assembly that at the 
moment it is not proper for his ministry to take the initiative 
in repealing the Team Spirit exercise system. 
  "The Team Spirit is one of the strong means of pressuring 
North Korea into giving up nuclear development," Yi said.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 19 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam's 
government, evaluating its own achievements in its first year, 
claimed Saturday it has succeeded above all in planting roots of 
democracy firmly in this country. The presidential office at 
Chongwadae said it has also managed to revitalize the nation's 
economy through eradication of corruption and irregularities and 
adoption of the real-name financial transaction system. 
  If the overriding goal of President Kim's five-year term is 
to build a "new Korea" by boosting international 
competitiveness, the first year was spent in firming up the 
foundation, said Chongwadae in a report issued Saturday on the 
first year of the Kim administration. The nation's first 
democratically elected president, Kim marks the first 
anniversary of his administration on Feb. 25. The report, 
however, acknowledged that there had been criticism of "the 
president's solo performance" evidenced by his strong leadership. 
  It admitted that the Kim administration has been charged 
with 
sapping the country's economy and social activities by enforcing 
an anti-corruption campaign aimed at settling old scores. It 
also acknowledged that confusion among government agencies has 
arose concerning follow-up measures to the real-name sysytem, 
the uruguay round of trade negotiations and the North Korean 
nuclear issue. But the Kim administration has courageously 
excised rotten parts of society and wiped out corruption and 
social injustice accumulated under the authoritarian governments 
of former army generals over three decades, it said. 
  The administration's efforts to clean up the country were 
made possible through investigation that does not allow 
sanctuary and by strengthening the government's investigative 
functions, the report said. 
  The civilian government has undertaken a series of lightning 
reshuffles and purges of military officers, who had long enjoyed 
special status under previous administrations, it said. The Kim 
administration has also disbanded the once powerful private 
political organization in the military, known as "Hana-hoe." 
The daring military reform was carried out despite concerns 
that it could harm the morale of officers and soldiers alike, it 
said. 
  With regard to political reform, the report noted that the 
Kim administration managed to clean up corruption through public 
disclosure of the personal assets of lawmakers as well as other 
public servants. A revision of the ethics law for public 
servants and political reform bills to be taken up by the 
National Assembly are other significant achievements, it said. 
  On the nation's economy, the report said the growth rate 
perked up to 5 percent in 1993, up from 3 percent in the second 
half of 1992. The country has also registered a trade surplus 
for the first time in four years. The administration, however, 
recognizes the criticism leveled against excessive economic 
stimulus measures and its alleged failure at the Uruguay Round 
of global trade negotiations, which forced the opening of the 
rice market to imports, it said. 
  As for future tasks facing the administration, the report 
cited the need to strenghten the country's competitiveness by 
expanding social infrastructure and comprehensive relaxation of 
administrative regulations. Early adoption of political reform 
bills, education reform, stablization of consumer prices, and 
improvement in inter-Korean relations are other issues the 
administration will have to tackle in the near future, it said.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Sa Tong-sok] </F>
  [Text] The government yesterday announced a detailed 
schedule for the privatization of state-owned corporations and 
the sale of shares it holds in already-privatized companies from 
this year through 1998. Under the plan, about 7 trillion won of 
state shares will be sold to the public through the stock market 
or open bidding, the Economic Planning Board [EPB] said. Of the 
7 trillion won, the Korea Development Bank holds 1.5 trillion 
won worth. 
  Thirty state-owned corporations will be privatized, 
including 
the Citizens National Bank, Industrial Bank of Korea, Korea 
Housing Bank, Korea Tobacco &amp; Ginseng Corp., Korea 
Fertilizer, 
Korea Heavy Industries and Construction or Hanjung and National 
Textbook Printing Co. 
  The selling of state stocks is planned for the Korea 
Exchange 
Bank, Kia Steel, Lucky Metals, Dongbu Chemical, Daewoo 
Shipbuilding, Asiana Airlines and Samsung General Chemical. In 
addition, 11 companies including Daehan Coal Corp. and Korea 
Mining Promotion Corporation will be subject to merges, EPB 
officials said. 
  The privatization plan came in response to President Kim 
Yong- sam's call for reforming the state sector late last year. 
Kim, who has overseen wide-spread economic reforms since taking 
office a year ago, had ordered "major surgery" for poorly 
managed state firms. 
  The EPB said it reached a consensus with the Finance 
Ministry 
to privatize the Citizens National Bank [CNB] this year by 
abolishing the law governing the establishment of the CNB. 
  Privatization of the Industrial Bank of Korea and Korea 
Housing Bank will take place after 1996. 
  The Korea Tobacco &amp; Ginseng Corp. whose annual sales 
amounted 
to 2.75 trillion won in 1992 will be privatized in 1998. Its 
net profit reached about 274 billion won in the same year. 
  Industry analysts said the massive privatization plan will 
spark cut-throat competition to take over the state corporations 
among the chaebol or large business conglomerates as seen in the 
hectic battle for the business license for the nation's second 
mobile telephone network. 
  Government officials, however, ruled out the possibility of 
special favors for enterprises, saying companies will be subject 
to regulations envisaged in the credit control rule and the 
antitrust law. 
  Analysts fingered such corporations as Korea Heavy 
Industries 
and Construction or Hanjung, Korea Tungsten and Korea Fertilizer 
as those which will draw keen attention from the business 
community. 
  Hanjung, emerging from its prolonged business downturn, has 
been posting net profits since 1991 and will be privatized in 
late 1995. The company, which is engaged in the manufacture of 
power generation and industrial facilities, recorded sales of 
1.4 trillion won in 1992. 
  Also at the center of public attention is the Korea Tobacco 
&amp; 
Ginseng Corp. [KT &amp; G] which monopolizes domestic production 
and 
distribution of tobacco and ginseng. Analysts say the company 
taking over KT &amp; G will gain a stable income source. 
  The business community says there also are numerous 
financial 
firms which will be profitable for the companies taking them 
over. 
  Pending privatization and mergers, the government has 
ordered 
all public firms to freeze recruitment, cut pay-rolls and 
drastically reduce various fringe state benefits, such as 
interest-free loans to purchase apartment houses and 
scholarships for employees' children.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 19 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's automobile 
exports to the United States and West Europe, which were 
sluggish last year, are now on track to a full recovery. The 
Korea Auto Industrial Cooperative Association said Saturday that 
17,247 vehicles were shipped to the United States in January, a 
rise of 111.7 percent over the same month last year. Automobile 
exports to the United States registered a decline of 7.5 percent 
in 1993 from the previous year. 
  Shipments to West Europe reached 12,652 vehicles in January, 
up 32.7 percent over the same month in 1993 and far higher than 
last whole year's growth rate of 12.5 percent. Up until 1991, 
the United States and West Europe together took more than 50 
percent of South Korea's exports of finished vehicles. Last 
year, however, the share slumped to 37 percent due to reduced 
market demand and realigned sales networks in the two areas. 
  Beginning around the end of last year, demand for South 
Korean-made cars, especially the Sonata II of Hyundai Motor and 
Shepia of KIA, has been rising fast in Germany, France and Italy 
as well as in the United States. 
  "Now the two major regional markets represent 62.6 percent 
of 
our total auto exports," an official at the association said. 
  Contrary to brisk shipments to these areas, auto exports to 
other markets have declined visibly since the turn of the year. 
Vehicles exported to other Asian countries in January numbered 
no more than 1,421, down 72.6 percent from January last year and 
off 89.2 percent from last December. Shipments to Latin America 
declined 20 percent and to East Europe 63.6 percent in the first 
month of this year. The official said the slump in exports to 
these areas was due primarily to large stocks held by local 
dealers caused by brisk shipments late last year. 
  The country's automobile exports in January totaled 47,714, 
up 20.2 percent over the like period of last year.

  [Text] POSCO Huls has realized mass-production of 8-inch 
silicon wafers, a core material for M-DRAM (mega dynamic random 
access memory) chips, which have been entirely imported. 
Established as a high tech silicon wafer maker in December, 
1990, the company is a three-party joint venture among Pohang 
Iron &amp; Steel Co. (POSCO), Samsung Electronics and MEMC of the 
United States. 
  Its plant, set up at a cost of $200 million and located in 
Chonan, Chungchongnam-to, has been turning out 6-inch and 8-inch 
silicon wafers since last March. 
  On Dec. 27, POSCO Huls, headed by Sin In-po, won quality 
recognition for its products, especially its 8-inch silicon 
wafers, from Samsung Electronics, the world's largest memory 
chip maker. As the recognition was tantamount to that by the 
world's semiconductor markets, POSCO Huls began to mass-produce 
8-inch silicon wafers from the onset of this year, according to 
a company spokesman. 
  Operating the plant 24 hours a day, the company is supplying 
its products to domestic and foreign chip makers. 
  Thanks to POSCO Huls' achievements, Korea has become the 
fourth country in the world to be able to manufacture 8-inch 
silicon wafers following the United States, Japan and Germany. 
  The spokesman said that 8-inch silicon wafers enables their 
customers to sharply increase the added value of their products, 
while minimizing the defect ratio of their goods. 
  At present, POSCO Huls can roll off 40,000 8-inch silicon 
wafers per month but plans to increase the volume to 100,000 
from next year following the expansion of the plant. 
  Monthly local demand for 8-inch silicon wafers now amounts 
to 
15,000-20,000, most of which are used by Samsung Electronics. 
  Domestic demand will increase to 40,000 by the end of the 
first half of this year and to 100,000-110,000 early next year, 
the spokesman predicted. The spokesman said that the 
manufacture of 8-inch silicon wafers by POSCO Huls will 
translate into an import substitution of $100 million at least 
for this year. 
  Of the three joint partners, POSCO and MEMC specializing in 
semiconductor materials hold a 43.6 percent share of POSCO Huls 
each and Samsung Electronics the remaining 12.8 percent stake.

  [Text] Atel, the first joint venture with a major foreign 
telecommunications service company, has started operations here, 
saying that it will launch a vigorous expansion into the fast 
growing Northeast Asian telecom market. The new company is a 13 
billion won joint venture between PosData, a telecommunications 
service arm of Pohang Iron and Steel Co. (POSCO), and Telstra, 
state-owned telecom operator of Australia. 
  "We will start with the domestic value-added network (VAN) 
service market...but in the future we hope to play an active 
role in the Northeast Asian market," said Kim Tae-kyu, president 
and CEO of Atel, 51 percent of which is owned by PosData. 
  The company has already taken over some of PosData's VAN 
services including electronic data interchange, electronic mail 
and network integration and information services. The company 
also plans to provide international services in enhanced fax, 
voice mail and other VAN services. To this end, the company has 
established extensive links with such international services as 
CompuServe, Nifty-Serve, EasyNet and SprintNet. 
  Company officials said they are banking on the technological 
and market expertise of Telstra and the geographical location of 
Korea to launch into the Northeast Asian region including the 
Russian Far East and North Korea. Telstra, which was created in 
1992 through a merger of Telecom Australia and international 
call carrier OTC, is the second biggest telecom operator in the 
Asia-Pacific region after NTT of Japan. 
  PosData runs a nationwide computer network service called 
PosServe and also offers various VAN services including a data 
network linking giant steelmaker POSCO and its numerous 
subcontractors.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 22 (YONHAP) -- Seoul's population has 
decreased for the first time in history. 
  The Seoul city government said Monday that the number of 
registered residents, including foreigners, in the metropolis 
stood at 10,889,972 at last year's end, according to a tentative 
tally. The number is down 0.7 percent or 79,890 from 10,969,862 
at the end of 1992, city officials said. 
  The officials attributed the population drop mainly to 
government projects which have created sizable "bedroom" towns 
on the outskirts of Seoul. 
  An official said, "a lot of people have moved from Seoul to 
the bedroom towns including Pundang, Ilsan and Sanbon since an 
enormous number of apartments were constructed there in a 
government project to ease Seoul's housing shortage. 
  "In addition, many workers who formerly lived in the 
industrial complex in Kuro-ku have moved to other cities, 
looking for cleaner and easier jobs. Rural people are not 
coming to Seoul for jobs anymore." 
  The population in Kuro-ku, where several factories are 
clustered, fell by 14,684 to 724,230 at last year's end from a 
year earlier.

  [Text] Dear friends, on 18 February before departing for 
home after a three-day official friendship visit to Cambodia, 
SRV Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam held a news conference in 
Phnom Penh on results of the visit. 
  Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said: My visit is aimed at 
strengthening the relations of good neighborliness, friendship, 
and cooperation between Vietnam and Cambodia. The visit is also 
aimed at making preparations for the forthcoming visit to 
Cambodia by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. Besides my talks with 
Prince Norodom Sirivut, deputy prime minister and minister of 
foreign affairs and international cooperation, I was also 
received by First Prime Minister Ranariddh, Second Prime 
Minister Hun Sen, and Chea Sim, acting chief of state and 
chairman of the National Assembly. It is necessary to say that 
talks and meetings between the Vietnamese and Cambodian 
delegations proceeded in an atmosphere of frankness, sincerity, 
and mutual understanding. The Cambodian leaders stressed the 
long-standing relations of traditional friendship between the 
two countries. In this spirit, the Cambodian leaders expressed 
the confidence that all issues of bilateral relations can be 
definitely resolved. We have discussed orientations and 
measures aimed at accelerating bilateral relations. We have 
exchanged views on the signing of agreements on economic, trade, 
scientific-technological, cultural, and education cooperations. 
We have also discussed cooperation in the fields of promoting 
investment and avoiding double taxation. We have agreed that 
efforts should be made to complete all essential work so that 
these agreements can be signed during the official visit to 
Cambodia by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. The two sides expressed 
the confidence that the upcoming visit to Vietnam by Cambodian 
National Assembly Chairman Chea Sim and the official visit to 
Cambodia by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet will open up a new stage 
in the relations of friendship and cooperation between the two 
nations. 
  We have agreed to settle the pending issues through 
negotiations in the spirit of mutual respect and understanding. 
These are issues related to the border demarcation and 
Vietnamese residents in Cambodia which were discussed during the 
visit to Vietnam by the two copremiers of the Cambodian 
provisional government in August 1993. Concerning this issue, 
both sides agreed that it is necessary to set up an essential 
mechanism to exchange views and work out a solution for the 
problem in the spirit of mutual respect and understanding. We 
have also agreed to exchange visits by delegations of different 
fields and levels between the two countries. During my meetings 
with Cambodian officials, we discussed orientations, measures, 
and other concrete issues in the field of bilateral relations. 
  Minister Nguyen Manh Cam stressed: During talks between the 
Vietnamese and Cambodian delegations, both sides expressed the 
common determination to strengthen and expand the relations of 
good neighborliness and friendship and the multifaceted 
cooperation for mutual interest. It is necessary to say that 
these relations have developed on the basis of the principles 
stipulated in the January 1992 Vietnam-Cambodia Joint Communique 
and the August 1993 Vietnam- Cambodia Joint Statement. These 
are the principles of respecting each other's national 
independence, sovereignty, self-determination, and territorial 
integrity. In summing up, my visit to Cambodia was a splendid 
success. It is hoped that this visit will undoubtedly 
contribute to strengthening, consolidating, and developing the 
relations of traditional friendship and cooperation between the 
two countries. I can say that these relations not only serve 
the interests and meet requirements for development and 
prosperity in each country, but also contribute to consolidating 
the trend of peace, stability, and cooperation for development 
in the region. 
  Afterward, Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam answered 
reporters' questions. 
  Answering an AFP correspondent's question on the mechanism 
for resolving pending issues between the two nations, Minister 
Nguyen Manh Cam said: We have planned to exchange delegations 
at two levels, namely the specialist and governmental levels. 
When the specialists complete all essential work, delegations 
at governmental level will meet to make the final decision. 
  Dealing with an ASSOCIATED PRESS correspondent's question on 
ethnic Vietnamese who were stuck in the Cambodia-Vietnam border 
areas, Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said: In our talks and meetings 
with the Cambodian side, we asked the Cambodian Government to 
take measures to resolve the issue of ethnic Vietnamese and 
Vietnamese who live in Cambodia for a long time. These people 
have fled to the border areas in the wake of the Khmer Rouge 
massacre in the recent past. The Cambodian side said that they 
will pay special attention to resolving this issue by studying 
and taking essential measures to alleviate difficulties endured 
by these ethnic Vietnamese. 
  Answering the Voice of America correspondent's question on 
the Khmer Rouge's action of continuing to massacre ethnic 
Vietnamese and Vietnamese residents in Cambodia, Minister Nguyen 
Manh Cam stressed: Stemming from the relations of friendship 
and cooperation, we believe that the government of the Kingdom 
of Cambodia will take essential measures to stop this massacre. 
I understand that this act of the Cambodian Government will 
contribute to ensuring security for Cambodia itself, this is 
because the massacre of foreigners in the country will directly 
affect the security of Cambodia. Racial discrimination and 
massacre only create complications to countries concerned while 
causing losses to the nation with ethnic minorities. This is 
because the ethnic minorities, in one way or another, have 
contributed to economic building and developing of the country 
of their residence. The Khmer Rouge's massacre of ethnic 
Vietnamese has been and will be further condemned by world 
public opinion. 
  Dealing with a REUTER correspondent's question on the 
possibility of Vietnam selling weapons and military equipment to 
Cambodia at the proposal of the Cambodian Government, Minister 
Nguyen Manh Cam asserted: Vietnam has never engaged in arms 
trading.

  [Text] Hanoi, Feb 22 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- ASEAN 
Secretary-General Ajit Singh Monday dispelled notions that there 
are obstacles to Vietnam joining the Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations which now has six members. There are no obstacles 
at all. Vietnam's membership is not the issue now, he told 
reporters who approached him and Vietnamese Foreign Minister 
Nguyen Manh Cam as they emerged from a three-hour meeting at the 
Government Guest House here Monday evening. 
  When a reporter pressed on whether in that case, Vietnam 
could even join ASEAN today itself, Ajit Singh said the issue 
now was the question of timing. Cam interjected and said the 
timing of Vietnam's entry was for further discussion by ASEAN 
member natioms -- Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, the 
Philippines, and Brunei. 
  Ajit Singh was also asked whether ASEAN felt that the 
lifting 
of the United States' trade embargo on Vietnam early this month 
made it necessary more than ever for the communist country to 
join the grouping. He replied that ASEAN has always regarded 
Vietnam as part of the region and its granting of an observer 
status to the country was a recognition of this fact. 
  Cam was asked whether there was consensus among Vietnam's 
traders that their country should join ASEAN immediately. He 
replied by referring to Vietnam Communist Party 
Secretary-General Do Muoi's statement in Thailand last year that 
Vietnam would join ASEAN at an appropriate time. This means 
that the timing of Vietnam's entry into ASEAN depends on the 
agreement between Vietnam and ASEAN, he said During his 
six-day visit to Vietnam, the first by an ASEAN 
secretary-general, Ajit Singh is also scheduled to tour Dalat, 
Hue, and Ho Chi Minh City.

<F P=106> [Speech by Ambassador to Thailand Le Cong Phung on 21 </F>
February to a seminar organized by THE NATION and KRUNGTHEP 
THURAKIT] 
  [Text] As you know, on February 3, 1994, U.S. President 
Bill Clinton declared the lifting of the U.S. embargo on Vietnam 
and proposed the mutual establishment of liaison offices in the 
capitals of the two countries. The U.S. embargo against Vietnam 
and the struggle for the lifting of this policy have been an 
animated matter, closely followed by the public during the past 
years. The declaration this time by President Clinton is a 
positive and significant decision which contributes to the 
opening of a new page in U.S.-Vietnam relations in the interests 
of the two countries. This decision not only meets the desire of 
the American and the Vietnamese peoples, but also meets the 
desire of many other countries. The lifting of the embargo and 
the improvement of U.S.-Vietnam relations will make a 
significant contribution to the common endeavour for peace, 
friendship and cooperation among nations all over the world, 
especially in South East Asia. 
  I am honoured to inform you that the government and people 
of 
Vietnam welcome the decision of the U.S. government; the 
government and people of Vietnam wish to express their sincere 
gratitude to all those in the United States and in other 
countries, to the government and people of Thailand, 
particularly to H.E. [His Excellency] Foreign Minister Prasong 
Sunsiri himself, for their contribution to the lifting of U.S. 
embargo and the improvement of relations between Vietnam and the 
United States of America. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, the lifting of the embargo on Vietnam 
brings about the appearance of a series of new problems and many 
questions have been put forward, such as: 
  -- Will there be any change in the policy of investment and 
trade of Vietnam? or, 
  -- How does the lifting of the embargo affect the economic 
development of Vietnam? or 
  -- With the coming of U.S. companies into Vietnam, will 
Vietnam pay more attention to the relations of cooperation and 
investment with its neighbouring countries in the region or not? 
  And, so on. 
  It is necessary to reaffirm that the lifting of the embargo 
and step by step moves towards the normalization of relations 
with Vietnam by the U.S. will not divert the foreign policy and 
foreign economic relations of Vietnam. The improvement of 
U.S.-Vietnam relations will not obstruct or be detrimental to 
the cooperation of Vietnam with other countries, especially with 
countries in Southeast Asia. On the contrary, the lifting of 
the embargo and improvement of the U.S.-Vietnam relations will 
contribute to creating favourable condition for the stability 
and economic development of Vietnam; promoting more quickly, 
essentially and effectively the political relations, economic 
cooperation and trade of Vietnam with countries in the region, 
including Thailand. 
  The Vietnam National Assembly session in December 1993 and 
the mid-term Congress of our Party in January 1994 reaffirmed to 
continue our foreign policy of befriending all countries in the 
world, firstly with neighbouring countries; to continue the 
economic renovation, opening for cooperation with all countries; 
to overcome shortcomings, modify and amend policies to more 
effectively strengthen the investment cooperation with foreign 
countries. In other words, politically, we do not want to side 
with any country against others but we want to be the friend of 
all countries on the basis of mutual respect. We shall continue 
to adjust, amend and complete our economic cooperation policies 
and investment laws in order to create conditions to encourage 
foreign investors and partners. 
  We should also recognize as a matter of fact that many U.S. 
companies will come to Vietnam in the post-embargo period. So 
far, more than 30 U.S. companies have already opened 
representative offices in Vietnam, some of which have begun to 
operate. Dozens of other companies have been applying to come 
to do business in Vietnam. With capital and technological 
advantage, U.S. companies will be competitive rivals for 
businessmen from other countries. It will be possible for 
Vietnam to draw capital and expertise of over one million 
Vietnamese residents in the U.S. But I myself believe that the 
coming of U.S. companies into Vietnam will not bring about an 
explosion of economic development of Vietnam. A major effect of 
the lifting of the embargo is to relieve psychologically for our 
friends to cooperate and invest in Vietnam. In the past, 
affected by the embargo, some countries seemed to hesitate to 
cooperate or invest in Vietnam; many kinds of goods technology 
and equipment which we would like to trade with other countries, 
were restricted. At present, the World Bank, the IMF and other 
financial institutions, together with the joining of U.S. 
companies in the Vietnamese market, there emerges a new 
atmosphere in investment, cooperation and trade. Vietnam has 
greater demand for economic development; the market of Vietnam 
has much potential as a source of labour, natural resources and 
consuming power. No individual country in the world, not even 
Japan and the United States could meet the development demands 
of Vietnam. We believe that the more the economy of Vietnam 
develops, the more investment opportunities and commercial 
relations will increase. 
  Regarding the investment area, after six years of 
implementing the investment law, we have gained great 
achievements, but at the same time there still exist problems 
which need to be solved if we want to have rapid development in 
the post-embargo period. 
  Over the past six years, we have granted 836 investment 
licences with a total capital of over U.S.$7 billion. The 
investment rate grew quickly. In the period of 1988-1991, it 
rose with an annual average of 51 per cent. In 1992 it equalled 
70 per cent of the previous four years. In the first ten months 
of 1993, it surpassed the whole year of 1992, both in number of 
projects and total capital. Of the total investment capital of 
U.S.$7 billion mentioned above, the investment in 1993 amounted 
to U.S.$3 billion. 
  The scale of investment also increased and there appears 
more 
big companies and groups. In the period of 1988-1990, the 
average amount of capital for one project was U.S.$3.5 million, 
but it rose to U.S.$7.6 million and $9.9 million in the 
1991-1992 period and in 1993 respectively. Up to now, though 
small scale projects account for 73 per cent of the total number 
of projects, they occupy only 12 per cent of the total 
investment capital. The investment form of 100 per cent 
foreign-owned capital only accounted for 6 per cent in the 
period of 1988-1992, now increases to 17 per cent with 128 
investment licences and promises a rapid growth in the coming 
time. During the initial years, most of the investment capital 
concentrated on the fields of oil and gas (32 per cent) and 
hotels (20.6 per cent), but since 1991, investment capital for 
industry has grown. Now, 70 per cent of the total investment 
projects is in the field of material production. 
  Our other significant achievement is that we have increased 
the number of Vietnamese counterparts in joint ventures and 
cooperation with foreign countries. The mechanism relating to 
investment, management and regulations has made obvious 
progress. Especially, we have formed a contingent of staff 
capable of working with foreign counterparts. This is what we 
never had in the past and also it's not easy to achieve within a 
short period of time. With the momentum of economic development 
in the past years, we have also achieved initial successes in 
accounting and mobilizing domestic capital, contributing to the 
increased effectiveness of joint ventures with foreigners. 
  Apart from the above-mentioned achievements, we also made 
mistakes and there remain problems which need to be solved soon. 
That is to quickly complete the legal system and regulations to 
protect and encourage foreign investment; to strengthen the 
state machinery, reduce the hurdles and bureaucracy; to urgently 
solve the problem of infrastructure; to effectively train 
management personnel, reinforce the contingent of staff capable 
of working with foreign counterparts. And in the coming time, 
priority should be given to investment projects in industry, oil 
and gas, and infrastructure. Viet-Thai relations have been 
finely developing. After the visit to Thailand last October by 
H.E. Secretary General Do Muoi, in the next few weeks H.E. Prime 
Minister Chuan Likphai will visit Vietnam to further cement the 
relations of friendship and cooperation between our two 
countries. Parallel to the development of the political 
relations and the mutual confidence and understanding between 
our two countries, it is the remarkably encouraging growth in 
our economic relations. We are happy to notice that a number of 
big companies or groups such as CP, Bangpakok, Saha Union, 
Sahanarya, Siam Cement, Padang and so on and so forth, the big 
banks like the Bangkok Bank, Thai Military Bank, Thai Farmers 
Bank etc have made their presence felt in Vietnam apart from 
many small and medium sized companies, and a number of joint 
ventures and investment projects executed by Thai businessmen 
have started their operations with initial results. 
  We also understand that some Thai businessmen still hesitate 
in doing business in Vietnam. You are worried about the 
uncertainty in our laws and regulations, the red tape and 
bureaucracies, the unfavourable prices, low level of management 
and the poor infrastructures. 
  Your concerns are correct. In fact, those shortcomings and 
difficulties mentioned above are a hundred percent true. 
However, I hold that they only constitute our country's 
constraints and problems in its initial stage of development. 
Vietnam embarked on its new economic policy with the investment 
law less than six years ago. A six-year period is too short a 
time for us to bring about a dramatic change for a whole 
structure and a policy of economic development. I do not know if 
there is any country which can progress without stumbling in 
their initial steps of development. 
  The upgrading of infrastructure is our pressing requirement 
and priority. Yet, to tackle this problem is not an easy task, 
especially in the case of Vietnam which has proceeded from a 
war-devastated economy with a low level of development. At the 
moment we are concentrating our efforts to develop our 
infrastructure through the use of funds provided by the IMF, the 
World Bank, the ADB as well as ODA from various countries. We 
highly appreciate the high determination of Thai companies like 
Bangpakok which has been taking part in projects to develop the 
infrastructure in Vietnam. We welcome a number of other Thai 
companies which have submitted their applications for their 
participation in building airports, seaports and upgrading of 
transport and telecommunication systems in Vietnam. 
  Another concern of yours is whether or not Vietnam shall 
continue to cooperate with Thailand after the lifting of the 
U.S. trade embargo. I can assure you that we have and continue 
to encourage and promote economic cooperation, trade and 
investment with Thailand. It is our consistent policy that 
conforms with the interests of stability and development of the 
two countries as well as of other countries in the region. 
  I firmly believe that the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo 
will provide a more favourable condition for our two countries 
to work together both in political and economic fields. Thai 
investors may join U.S. companies in investing in Vietnam. 
Thai-based American firms like Kodak Thai, Unocal Thai etc. may 
easily have access to the Vietnamese market. There are 
promising chances to realize the idea to turn Thailand into a 
financial and technical gateway to Indochina and Vietnam. The 
question is that in view of present constraints in the way to 
invest in Vietnam, like law and regulations, facilities, 
bureaucracies, low infrastructures and so on and so forth, 
whether Thai investors should start their joint ventures, 
investment or cooperation with Vietnam now or wait until 
everything is satisfactorily prepared. 
  I am afraid that we can let the chances slip out of our 
hands 
if we hesitate. 
  Excellencies, Friends, 
  In conclusion, I wish to reaffirm that Vietnam will continue 
to carry out its process of economic renewal, openness and 
development of its economic, trade and investment with foreign 
countries. While the lifting of the U.S. embargo and 
particularly when the two countries can normalize their 
relations, will facilitate the entry of American companies to do 
business in Vietnam, we shall attach more importance to trade 
and investment cooperation with other countries especially with 
our neighbouring countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand.

  [Text] HANOI, Feb 22 (AFP) -- The trial of former 
Vietmamese energy minister Vu Ngoc Hai, implicated in one of the 
biggest corruption scandals of recent years, has become 
abnormally drawn out because of persistent arguments between 
lawyers. Journalists report that the public hearing, now in its 
fifth day, has significantly overrun the 72 hours originally 
alotted for it because of lengthy debates between the 
prosecution and Hai's lawyers. According to judicial sources, a 
verdict is now not expected before Wednesday afternoon. 
Observers claim such delays are rare in the Vietnamese legal 
process. 
  The circumstances leading up to charges being brought 
against 
Hai after two years of investigation are particularly 
complicated and politically sensitive. Prime minister Vo Van 
Kiet even declared the affair a matter of priority. The trial, 
which calls a former government official into question for the 
first time since 1975, is considered a test of the goverment's 
will to stamp out corruption which has worsened since Vietnam 
moved to a market economy. The former energy minister is 
accused of "abuse of power" in the delivery of 4,000 tonnes of 
steel intended for the construction of the first 500 kilovolt 
electric powerline from the north to the south of Vietnam. 
  He allegedly ordered the steel from a small intermediary 
company run by one of his relatives instead of going through 
Vinametal, the main state firm responsible for metal trading. 
The prosecution alleged that by-passing the state company cost 
Vinametal 3.1 billion dongs (about 300,000 US dollars). 
  Hai is appearing in court together with his former deputy 
minister Le Liem and seven other co-accused who are directors of 
other companies implicated in the scandal. The prosecution has 
asked for a fixed three-year jail sentence for the former 
minister and a two-year suspended sentence for his deputy. It 
requested three to seven-year sentences for their associates. 
The defence lawyers have called for outright acquittals for the 
two main defendants because of the "complexity" of the case and 
the "lack of precision" of the charges. 
  The case is highly sensitive since the prime minister, who 
has vowed to make the fight against corruption one of the 
priorities of his government in 1994, personally committed 
himself to the construction of the 500 kilovolt powerline, which 
should alleviate the energy shortage in the country's southern 
provinces. The development project, which is one of the most 
important in Vietnam, has been plagued by bribery and by theft 
of materials since it began in 1992. It has been delayed and 
its cost, originally estimated at 300 million US dollars by the 
authorities, has almost doubled. 
  Three days before the start of the trial Kiet fired Hai from 
his job as "prime minister's special supervisor for the 500 
kilovolt powerline". He was sacked from the government last 
year and was last month expelled from the Central Committee of 
the Communist Party. However neither he nor his deputy has been 
arrested. 
  Foreign journalists have been present at the trial and the 
proceedings have been relayed to several dozen onlookers through 
loudspeakers in the courtyard of the central law courts.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday 
justified Thailand's right to fire on Cambodian armed trawlers 
and said Thailand was seeking compensation for damage from Phnom 
Penh. Sqn Ldr [Squadron Leader] Prasong said the Foreign 
Ministry's treaty and legal affairs division had concluded that 
Thailand had the right to claim damages because the armed 
trawlers intruded into Thai waters, an act against Thai and 
international law. 
  A battle between the Navy's gunboats and suspected Cambodian 
pirates took place on Saturday off Koh Kut in Trat province. One 
Cambodian trawler and two Thai fishing boats, apparently caught 
between the Navy and suspected pirates, were sunk. 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong maintained that the Foreign Ministry would 
call for "high level" talks unless Cambodia paid for the damage. 
Thailand has set a condition for Cambodia to pay for the damage 
to two Thai trawlers and to pay for the treatment of one injured 
navy crew member. 
  Cambodia called for the release of 14 suspected pirates 
detained after the battle, he said. The cost of damage to the 
Thai fishing boats was not known, according to the minister. 
  Thailand held talks between the Trat provincial governor and 
the chief of staff of the Chantaburi-Trat Force and Cambodia's 
Koh Kong governor, Rung Phlamkesan, who reported the outcome of 
the talks to those concerned, he said. 
  The pirates were being detained in Trat for questioning. 
They were suspected of being Cambodian soldiers, he said. 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong said the Cambodian armed trawlers were 
believed to have been stolen from Thailand. 
  Navy Commander-in-Chief Adm Prachet Siridet said the 
suspected pirate ships were actually "Cambodian warships" which 
came into Thai water to arrest Thai trawlers. The battle erupted 
after the Cambodian ships ignored warning shots. He said the 
Thai Navy was patrolling Thai waters 24 hours a day to ensure 
safety for Thai fishermen and were now in need of new patrol 
boats because existing ones had been in service a long time. He 
said the violent incident could have been avoided if the 
Cambodian warships had let the Thai trawlers go after warning 
shots were fired. He said there might be ulterior motives for 
the Cambodian actions but he did not want to reveal these.

  [Text] Efforts have been made by various parties to reach 
an understanding through discussions over an incident in which 
Thai fishing boats were fired upon by foreign soldiers who 
claimed that Thai trawlers intruded into Cambodian waters off 
Koh Kong Province. An exchange of gunfire ensued as a result. 
  Commenting on it, Interior Minister General Chawalit 
Yongchaiyut said the shooting was a result of misunderstanding. 
He said the governor of Trat Province is holding a discussion 
with the governor of Koh Kong to settle the problem. Gen. 
Chawalit said he knew nothing about the reported closing of the 
border at Koh Kong. 
  Defense Minister General Wichit Sukmak said that 
negotiations 
had been held, and he believes the problem will be settled. He 
said the Thai Navy proposed a joint patrol of the area. He said 
he had reported to the prime minister the steps taken on this 
matter. 
  [Begin recording] [Wichit] If there is a channel for talks, 
I believe there will be a settlement on the issue. The Thai 
Navy proposed a joint patrol of the area to prevent future 
incidents. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Have you reported the incident to 
the Cabinet? 
  [Wichit] No, but I have reported to the prime minister about 
the guidelines we have followed to deal with the problem. We 
are coordinating work with the foreign minister and the interior 
minister to settle the problem. I told foreign correspondents a 
while ago that we have received cooperation from the Cambodian 
defense minister, His Excellency Tie Banh. We have already 
discussed the matter with him. [end recording]

  [Text] Army Commander in Chief General Wimon Wongwanit said 
any Cambodians who intrude into Thailand will be arrested, 
disarmed, and sent back to Cambodia. 
  Speaking at the Army Golf Course on 19 February about the 
intrusion by Cambodian soldiers at An Ma Pass, the army chief 
said should there be any new intrusions, the army will deal with 
them strictly. He said the incident at An Ma Pass was not 
serious because there were no houses there. Concerning the 
problem of the abduction of Thai villagers by Khmer bandits, he 
said he had instructed border units to deal with the problem 
harshly. He said: If they are rough with us, the army will be 
tough with them, no matter if they are civilians or soldiers. 
The army had been mild with them because they were considered 
friends. They have no reason to accuse us of supporting the 
Khmer Rouge. 
  Gen. Wimon said Thailand suffered numerous losses from 
clashes between the government and Khmer Rouge forces. Thailand 
wants to see the fighting stop because it has brought 
difficulties to both soldiers and civilians on the Thai side.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Thai-Cambodian Clash"] </F>
  [Excerpts] An unfavorable neighborly skirmish between 
Thailand and Cambodia took place late last week when warships of 
the two countries clashed in the Gulf of Thailand. The 
Cambodian warship reportedly encroached on Thai territorial 
waters to seize Thai fishing trawlers. As a result, the 
Cambodian ship was sunk, and the Cambodian crewmen were rescued 
and detained by Thai authorities. A Thai fishing trawler was 
also sunk during the gun battle. This type of small war is in 
fact one of the common problems between countries sharing the 
same border. 
  In any event, such a border brawl, be it on the land or in 
the sea, is not a big problem as long as authorities of the two 
countries can settle the conflict quickly to prevent it from 
further aggravation, which can lead to a bigger war. If the 
governments of the two countries intend to safeguard their 
friendly relations, they can establish direct contacts, even 
through their embassies, so that they will be able to get in 
touch to settle any conflict and prevent animosity between the 
peoples of the two countries. [passage omitted] 
  The solution to the problem is that the Thai Government must 
keep close contacts with neighboring countries and warn Thai 
fishing trawlers to stay away from territorial waters of other 
countries. The solution sounds simple. Meanwhile, the 
government must hold talks with the neighboring countries to 
encourage them to join hands with us in the fishing industry. 
So far, our government's efforts in this regard have not been 
successful. Burma, to cite an example, has decided to terminate 
the fishing cooperation agreement with us and adopt a new policy 
of shooting at all Thai fishing trawlers found violating its 
territorial waters. It is very likely that this sort of problem 
between the two countries will never be solved.

  [Text] Cambodian government troops yesterday bowed to a 
demand by the Thai military to withdraw from a Thai base at An 
Ma Pass after a spillover from fighting with Khmer Rouge forces. 
  About 500 Cambodian Government soldiers seized a Khmer Rouge 
stronghold near the Thai-Cambodian border yesterday morning and 
were later able to seize the camp after attacking it with heavy 
shelling. Some of the Cambodian forces allegedly intruded into 
Thai territory at An Ma Pass and later occupied a Thai military 
base about 50 metres from the common border. 
  The Cambodian troops earlier refused to pull out of the 
base, 
claiming they wanted to wait until they were able to clear 
landmines on the Cambodian side. They later agreed to withdraw 
after a tough stand from the Thais. During negotiations, a 
Cambodian soldier was killed when he stepped on a landmine. 
  A Cambodian soldier said the Cambodian government planned to 
launch large-scale offensives against Khmer Rouge strongholds 
this dry season. About 100 shells reportedly landed on Thai 
soil during fighting yesterday morning but there were no reports 
of casualties or damage to Thai property.

  [Text] 19 February, 1994. A Chinese Embassy spokesman 
issued a press release on Li Teng-hui's so-called "holiday" 
visit to Thailand. The press release reads: 
  Regarding the "holiday" visit to Thailand by Taiwan's Li 
Teng-hui and his delegation, the Chinese side had repeatedly 
explained its stand and made solemn representations to Thailand 
in advance. The Chinese side had repeatedly pointed out that Li 
Teng-hui, in the guise of holiday-making, had attempted to 
develop "substantive relations" with Thailand, to create "two 
Chinas" in the world, and to damage and disturb the existing 
friendly relations between China and Thailand. China hoped that 
Thailand would have taken into acount its overall interests in 
the maintenance and development of the Sino-Thai relations and 
cancel Li Teng-hui's visit to Thailand. We notice that although 
His Excellency Prime Minister Chuan Likphai did not meet Li 
Teng-hui, Li Teng-hui did visit Thailand and meet some Thai 
leaders and senior government officials. Therefore it has 
violated the commitment made by the Thai Government on the 
Taiwan issue when China and Thailand established diplomatic 
relations. This is deeply regrettable.

<F P=106> [From the "From the Editor's Desk" column by Phaisan </F>
Sicharatchanya: "Towards a New and Independent Taiwan State 
(Separate from China)"] 
  [Excerpts] Taiwan President Li Teng-hui pulled off an 
unusual sort of diplomatic coup last week after completing his 
three-nation swing through Southeast Asia. For a 
self-proclaimed island republic that has been isolated in the 
international community as a result of China's increasing 
influence on the world stage, Mr. Li's `holiday' diplomacy 
appears to have worked. 
  Despite vocal protests from Peking even before he left 
Taipei, the Taiwanese president managed to secure informal 
meetings with Indonesian President Suharto and Philippine 
President Fidel Ramos. Although he did not meet Thai Prime 
Minister Chuan Likphai as earlier expected, Mr. Li sought and 
was granted a symbolically significant private audience with His 
Majesty the King in Bangkok. 
  The diplomatic controversy kicked up by Mr. Li's Thai visit 
did not come as a surprise -- treating Taiwan like a renegade 
province within the jurisdiction of its empire as it does, 
Peking would have been remiss of its responsibility if it had 
not protested against the Thai government. Likewise, the 
ensuing debates between senior Thai officials and opposition 
politicians over the pros and cons of Mr. Li's `vacation' were 
also expected. 
  Critics who warned of negative diplomatic and economic 
ramifications from lncurring the wrath of China might have a 
valid point in drawing the distinction between the Dalai Lama's 
visit here last year and Mr. Li's trip. Whereas Thailand scored 
some plus points among Western nations from hosting the Dalai 
Lama, there was virtually no diplomatic asset from hosting Mr. 
Li this time, not to mention the bruised feelings between 
Bangkok and Peking. 
  But taking the pessimistic view -- as senior Opposition 
Leader and Former Prime Minister Chatchai Chunhawan did -- that 
China might withdraw from (its participation in) the 
often-trumpeted Economic Quadrangle out of resentment over Mr. 
Li's visit has come across as being too farfetched. The 
Quadrangle scheme envisages bringing development -- a 
combination of trade, tourism, and investments -- to otherwise 
backward and land-locked areas of southern China, parts of 
Burma, Laos, and northern Thailand. If China chooses to deny its 
own territory of such development, then it is too bad. [passage 
omitted] 
  The potential negative repercussions aside, it was 
understandable why the Thai authorities had unofficially 
welcomed Mr. Li. Since Thailand broke off diplomatic relations 
with Taipei and switched to recognise Peking nearly 20 years 
ago, this country had not only kept up but also expanded its 
bilateral economic ties with Taiwan. [passage omitted] 
  The favourable assimilation between ethnic Chinese and Thais 
here is definitely more conducive to further growth in Taiwanese 
investments than certain other ASEAN countries where racial 
differences run deep. This is not to mention the prospect of 
legitimising the estimated 50,000 Thai workers in Taiwan and 
sending more workers there. 
  On balance, the immediate gains for Thailand from hosting 
Mr. 
Li appears to outweigh the potential adverse repercussions from 
upsetting Peking. And in retrospect, our conduct of an 
independent foreign policy would have been cast in a poor light 
if we had kowtowed to Chinese pressures in denying Mr. Li's 
visit. 
  This does not mean to say that the policy of unofficially 
accommodating Taiwan should remain static. Bilateral 
Thai-Chinese interests could well develop to such a dominant 
extent in the future that warrants pushing Taiwan to the 
sideline. In the meantime, it is the Foreign Ministry's 
responsibility to minimise whatever damage caused with China.

<F P=106> [Article by Kunachada Chaiphiphat under the "Viewpoint" </F>
rubric: "Taking a Risk on `Holiday Diplomacy'" -- first 
paragraph is THE NATION introduction] 
  [Excerpts] Taiwan President Li Teng-hui came to play golf, 
but those very unofficial, very private chats he had with top 
businessmen from three of China's regional allies certainly 
roiled the waters. Was it worth it? 
  The so-called "holiday diplomacy" trip to Thailand by 
Taiwanese President Li Teng-hui, which ended on Wednesday, has 
prompted some tough questions here. 
  First, is the visit to be seen as a test of wills between 
those who uphold Thailand's One-China policy and those who are 
hearing Taiwan's money talk -- or was it aimed at garnering 
political support from economic partners throughout the world? 
Second, was the "one-metre march", as President Li described 
his Southeast Asia tour, a signal that the island nation is 
making a diplomatic move toward declaring itself a new state -- 
and will China use force to stop it? Third, what does Thailand 
stand to gain from the visit? [passage omitted] 
  Elsewhere in Asean or the Indochinese states newly recovered 
from wars and needing massive foreign investment, Taiwanese 
businessmen always come in force and are invariably given a warm 
welcome. 
  Save for promoting national identity to weld together the 
mainland's plethora of diverse ethnic minorities and autonomous 
regions, it seems pointless for China to try and stop her 
neighbours from doing business with Taiwan. At the same time, it 
is too early to say whether Taiwan will be able to successfully 
swing political support over to its side. 
  A senior security official says China and Taiwan's 
relationship will continue to be a classic display of diplomacy, 
until the two sides settle their differences either by peace or 
by force. "Taiwan's aspiration is to exist as a state separate 
from China, in much the same way as North Korea and South Korea 
co-exist." 
  At this point no country, not even the United States, which 
helped separate the Korean peninsula, would put money on the 
Taiwanese side. "The overriding interest of the United States, 
in maintaining a peaceful presence in this region, is to 
befriend China," said the expert. 
  Hypothetically, he said, if Li's provocative tour was a test 
of world support for Taiwan declaring itself a new state, the 
island's best hope would be that global support would prevent 
China from using military force in response. This hypothesis 
will have some basis in fact if what President Li told local 
reporters when he returned home is translated into action. Li 
jokingly said he needed to march a hundred metres in order to 
gain world support. [passage omitted] 
  The same official said things will be much clearer after 
Hong 
Kong is handed back to China in 1997. "How China treats Hong 
Kong will have far-reaching implications for Taiwan too." 
  Thai officials at the Foreign Ministry said the economic 
gains to be made in allowing Li's visit are not evident. In the 
Philippines, Taiwanese businessmen are keen to turn Subic Bay 
into an industrial zone, while Indonesia and Taiwanese investors 
are planning to build an aircraft factory in Bundung. A senior 
official said the visit to Thailand was a gain for the 
Taiwanese. "Taiwan can claim back home that it has surmounted 
the Southeast Asian wall," he said. 
  Thailand, the official noted, has had both good and bitter 
experiences with China in terms of history and culture. "Why 
didn't China make as much noise in Singapore as it did here?" he 
asked. [passage omitted] 
  It is true Taiwanese investment in Thailand appears to have 
reached the saturation point. The choice of the Philippines and 
Indonesia as the first two stops shows where the priorities of 
Taiwanese investors lie. Board of Investment figures show that 
Taiwanese investment here has dropped from Bt [baht] 6.4 billion 
in 1991 to Bt5.96 billion in 1993. The turn-down has 
contributed to the relocation of the investment market to China 
and Vietnam. 
  So there are good reasons to encourage additional investment 
and to welcome Li without "violating the understanding, reached 
on the Taiwan issue", as China claimed. Moreover, even if 
Taiwanese investment has peaked in Thailand itself, there is 
plenty of opportunity for the Taiwanese to play a key part in 
the newborn Growth Quadrangle and the yet-to-take off triangular 
economic cooperation involving Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia. 
[passage omitted] 
  It is perhaps a bit unfortunate for Thailand to have been 
the 
last stop on Li's three-nation tour after so much propaganda 
from Taipei. [passage omitted] 
  As it turned out, the personal nature of the visit to 
Thailand was self-evident. The Chinese would only have to look 
at the people who received Li -- Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai 
Wirawan (known as Lin Ri Guang due to his business connections 
with Taiwan), his cousins and a few Thai businessmen including 
Utane Techaphaibun and Chatri Sophonphanit. They all had 
business reasons for talking with the visitors. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Dr. Zun Qi: "Li Teng-hui's Holiday Diplomacy"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Taiwan, known as the Republic of China, has 
behaved itself in the international community for over 20 years. 
After losing its United Nations seat in 1971, many countries, 
including Japan, ASEAN countries, and the United States, broke 
diplomatic relations to establish diplomatic relations with 
Beijing. Those countries, however, continue to maintain normal 
economic relations with Taiwan. [passage omitted] 
  Now, Taiwan maintains diplomatic relations with only 29 
countries, mostly small and poor countries in Africa or Latin 
America. No Asian countries have diplomatic relations with 
Taiwan, although they maintain good trade links with it. Taiwan 
leaders, especially President Li Teng-hui, want to improve 
Taiwan's position in the international arena. So they practice 
contructive diplomacy through informal visits or a "holiday" 
diplomacy. [passage omitted] 
  President Li Teng-Hui and his delegation arrived in Thailand 
on 14 February. In Phuket, President Li Teng-hui met some 
leading Thai businessmen such as rice exporter Hu Yulin [Thai 
name: Saman Ophatwong] and Li Guanglong [Thai name: Wisit 
Lilasithon]. He also played golf with Deputy Prime Minister 
Amnuai Wirawan. Although President Li Teng-hui did not meet 
Prime Minister Chuan Likphai and Foreign Minister Squadron 
Leader Prasong Sunsiri, he had an unexpected audience with the 
king for 20 minutes before leaving for home. Taiwan's efforts 
were successful, but it spent a lot for the ASEAN tour. 
  China tried to prevent the "holiday diplomacy." The Chinese 
Foreign Ministry issued warnings, saying that any reception of 
President Li Teng-hui would be tantamount to the violation of 
the "one-China" policy and affect bilateral relations. 
Moreover, China also canceled a visit by a National People's 
Congress delegation to Thailand and the Philippines. [passage 
omitted] 
  Thailand upholds the "one-China" policy. The Thai leader 
also did not meet President Li Teng-hui. So, China should 
understand Thailand's stand. 
  Taiwan's "holiday diplomacy" is profoundly wise. It will not 
achieve concrete political achievements, however, unless China 
loses its wisdom. All in all, it is believed that China will 
wisely continue to maintain its relations with ASEAN countries.

  [Excerpts] Army Commander in Chief Wimon Wongwanit 
yesterday accused the Defence Ministry of failing to coordinate 
government and military discussions about the food-for-arms 
barter trade policy. "All the problems and confusion should be 
referred to the permanent secretary for defence or the defence 
minister," said Wimon. "I want to know how they interpret the 
government's policy and whether they can explain it." 
  Wimon, who appeared testy while speaking to reporters at the 
National Defense Institute, said the army has no knowledge about 
barter trade. "We know nothing. We don't know what are 
Thailand's agricultural products. We don't know the prices. We 
don't know about marketing strategies. Our duty is to defend 
the country, not to trade," the army chief said. "Soldiers have 
to abide by orders. For example, if we need 155mm ammunition or 
artillery shells for target practice, the Defence Ministry can 
now no longer provide them because it has to follow Cabinet 
instructions. "I have asked the Defence Ministry how the 
government policy can be put into practice when we still need to 
know so much more. First of all, we don't know whether the 
barter trade should be implemented only in cases of major 
purchases. The ministry cannot give an answer." 
  Wimon complained that many arms proposals of the army have 
"bounced back" from the Defence Ministry. "It seems we can't 
move now. We can move only when the Defence Ministry has clear 
understanding [of the government's policy]. But what has 
happened is everything we proposed has bounced back," he said. 
"We need a system, otherwise in every arms deal we will have to 
bring with us cattle or pigs." 
  Meanwhile, senior government officials yesterday appeared to 
soften the food-for-arms policy, saying the military can still 
make deals to purchase weaponry while the government will 
negotiate with the supplier to buy Thai commodities. 
  Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said the military's 
misunderstanding of the policy had led to the confrontation 
between the armed forces and the Chuan administration. "It 
doesn't mean that we take our domestic products and ask foreign 
suppliers to accept them in exchange for arms," he explained. 
  The government's prime concern is to avoid a trade deficit. 
Relations between the government and the military floundered 
when the Cabinet insisted last week that the Air Force must 
employ a barter system for its planned purchase of six transport 
planes-- worth more than Bt4 billion -- from Italy. 
  Top brass, including Army Commander-in-Chief Wimon and 
Supreme Commander ACM Woranat Aphichari held a special meeting 
to discuss the issue and concluded that the idea is both old-hat 
and impractical. 
  Prasong said if the armed forces wanted to buy any military 
equipment they would just have to keep the government informed 
so that the relevant agencies could try to arrange the sale of 
Thai commodities to the country in question. 
  "We just want to ensure the country does not acquire a trade 
deficit. It's not a matter of exchanging rice for arms and the 
military understood it," he insisted. He said military leaders 
will accept the government's barter policy "because the military 
these days is very disciplined and ready to comply with the 
government policies, better than in the past". [passage omitted] 
  The president of Alenia, the Italian firm marketing the 
G-222 
transport planes sought by the Air Force, met Commerce Minister 
Uthai Pimchaichon yesterday to discuss the proposed purchase. 
  Deputy Commerce Minister Chaiyot Sasomsap,said the 
government 
will not scrap the planned purchase, but is negotiating for 
Italy to buy Thai farm produce. He said the Defence Ministry 
will ask Alenia to extend the validity of the quotation, which 
expires this month.

  [Excerpts] A prominent Democrat yesterday criticised 
Minister Wichit Sukmak for failing to liaise effectively with 
military top brass to explain the Government's policy. The 
party's secretary-general, Sanan Khachonprasat, said: "I don't 
know how the Defense Minister has explained this policy to the 
commanders for them not to have understood it and to have come 
out with the statements that they have." 
  The Industry Minister was speaking in Chiang Rai, where he 
was attending a gathering of office managers and executive 
committee members of the party's Northern branch to brief them 
on the political situation. Maj. Gen. [Major General] Sanan said 
it was the duty of the Defense Minister to go back again and try 
to explain the Government's requirement to the commanders. 
  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai, reaffirming the Government's 
commitment to its arms-through-barter policy, said he was 
confident the Defense Minister would be able to talk armed 
forces commanders into accepting it. Mr. Chuan said the Defense 
Minister had been asked to try once again to explain the 
Government's policy to the top brass. "I believe the Defense 
Minister can clear up any misunderstanding (the commanders) may 
have," he said. [passage omitted] 
  Maj. Gen. Sanan said the Government had never asked the 
armed 
forces to renegotiate the deal because the armed forces could 
not conduct the talks by themselves. "It is not Government 
policy to allow the Armed Forces to engage in negotiations. We 
only want talks so that Italy can be convinced to buy more Thai 
goods," he said. He said the arms market was at present in the 
hands of buyers because of a preponderance of manufacturers. 
  Waiting to allow responsible agencies to negotiate with the 
Italian Government would not upset the armed forces procurement 
process, and the Government was prepared to absorb any extra 
cost that might be caused by the delay. 
  He denied that the Government was putting pressure on the 
armed forces by tightening the procurement process. "We have to 
look at the whole picture," he said. "Our farm products are 
suffering. Everyone must help, particularly the armed forces. 
Other government agencies are no exception." 
  Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak denied that 
the 
Government was interfering with the Armed Forces' procurement 
process. "We want some delay only in order to press Italy to 
give Thailand more favorable terms on the deal," Mr Suphachai 
said. "We are about to spend thousands of millions of baht. We 
should have some more in return for what we're going to spend."

  [Excerpts] The Government's firm stand on its policy for 
the armed forces to try to negotiate a barter deal to acquire 
military hardware from abroad came under criticism from the top 
brass yesterday. 
  Supreme Commander ACM [Air Chief Marshal] Woranat Aphichari 
said the Government policy for the Armed Forces to procure 
weapons through barter deals was "impractical" and should be 
rectified. ACM Woranat's statement came after the Cabinet on 
Tuesday turned down the Air Force's request to forego the policy 
in acquiring a fleet of transport planes from Italy. The Air 
Force wants to buy six Italian-made medium G222 transport planes 
at a cost of US$131.5 million with funds allocated over the five 
years starting this year. [passage omitted] 
  Responding to ACM Woranat's comments, Prime Minister Chuan 
Likphai before leaving for Trang province insisted the military 
must comply with the policy. "If (the military) can try, then it 
must try. If it has not tried and just thinks that it cannot do 
it, then that is not correct. If we try and it fails, then we 
can talk," Mr Chuan said. 
  At the end of the Armed Forces' commanders' monthly meeting, 
ACM Woranat said the Government policy adopted in November would 
delay the arms acquisition process because the talks would be 
more time consuming. The delay could result in price increases 
and the Government having to pay more for the same equipment if 
deals could not be reached within deadlines. The Armed Forces 
had limited funds and the price increases would become a 
financial burden, he said. 
  ACM Woranat insisted that the Armed Forces had tried to 
follow the Government's policy in the arms acquisition plans 
"but since we are facing the difficulty in implementing it, then 
we have to inform the Government". 
  Under the Cabinet resolution in November, the Defence 
Ministry has assigned the Supreme Command to study how to barter 
Thai farm products for weapons. 
  The Commerce, Agriculture and Foreign ministries will be 
told 
in advance by the Supreme Command from which country the 
military will procure arms and see whether barter deals can be 
made. [passage omitted] 
  Lt-Gen Anuson Kritsanaserani, the director-general of the 
Armed Forces Information Office, said the armed forces 
commanders during yesterday's meeting expressed concern over the 
policy and assigned the armed forces comptrollers to look into 
the problem. He said the meeting also asked why the Cabinet did 
not impose similar conditions on contractors of mega-mass 
transit projects such as the elevated electric train systems. 
  Defence Minister Wichit Sukmak earlier said the Air Force 
would strictly follow the Cabinet resolution in settling the 
aircraft deal with Italy but noted that any further delay in the 
acquisition might result in an increase in price and quality. 
  RTAF [Royal Thai Air Force] commander ACM M.R. Siriphong 
Thongyai said he understood the Government's policy on arms 
procurement, saying that country would benefit from such a deal. 
However, he said the Government had limited time in the barter 
deal on G222s. [passage omitted] 
  Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak said the 
Cabinet merely wanted to make the utmost benefit out of the 
plane purchase plan for trade negotiation with Italy. The 
Government had no intention to interfere with the armed forces 
in their arms acquisition process. If the barter deal was too 
difficult to achieve, Thailand could obtain some other forms of 
trade benefits from Italy. 
  Thailand, for example, could ask Italy to ease its trade 
barriers on Thai canned seafood, or urge it to help talk with 
other European Union members to reduce tariffs on Thai exports 
such as tapioca or canned tuna sent to the community. 
  The Government did not require that Thailand must purchase 
the Italian planes only through the barter deal. 
  It may agree to such other things as more favourable trade 
terms or even for its support for certain Thai positions in the 
European Union, Mr Suphachai said. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary under the rubric: "Nation Analysis -- </F>
Military-Govt Ties"] 
  [Excerpts] The military's resistance to the government 
suggestion that future arms purchases could be funded through 
barter agreements with foreign suppliers is in every way typical 
of the armed forces' reaction whenever they feel their home turf 
is being violated. 
  Previous government attempts to have the military trade 
agricultural products for defense equipment have proved futile. 
This time the armed forces are saying once again that bartering 
is neither feasible nor appropriate for arms procurement, 
particularly when it concerns the need to modernize weapons 
systems. 
  Barter would require the use of international commodity 
trading firms to handle sales of agricultural products with the 
proceeds going to pay the weapons suppliers. This is a 
cumbersome, complicated arrangement, personally unrewarding -- 
and not preferred by those who want something under the table. 
  Multi-billion baht arms procurements in the past usually 
meant a lot more than professional pride to military leaders, 
who staunchly protected their vested interests under the pretext 
of "national security" and argued that acquisitions should not 
be subject to any scrutiny by the government. 
  The present generation of military leaders -- though with a 
relatively good image -- still owe some explanation to the 
government as to why they think barter trade is not acceptable 
when arms procurement is needed. 
  They know they still bear the brunt of public criticism 
arising out of questionable deals concluded by their 
predecessors, with doubts over possible kickbacks heightened due 
to the huge wealth of many in the top brass. 
  The public has a clear memory that whenever a barter deal 
has 
been suggested in the past, senior military officers have 
defended their preference for commercial deals or direct cash 
purchases by arguing that the best and most suitable weaponry 
could not be purchased by barter. 
  But subsequent embarrassing incidents revealed there had 
been 
more than just simple shady dealing involved. The weapons 
acquired were sometimes found to be far below acceptable 
standards, their shortcomings raising serious doubts about their 
effectiveness in a war. 
  Controversies involving Stingray light tanks, the Spada air 
defense system, and Bell Helicopter purchases, for example, have 
caused the generals to scramble for lame excuses to dilute the 
negative effects of the public outcry over suspicious deals -- 
about attractive commissions and kickbacks for all, from those 
responsible for preliminary arrangements up to the top decision 
makers. 
  There have been only a few successful bidders for arms 
deals, 
as the record of the armed forces shows. Fewer than five firms 
have shared in cozy arrangements with the military, with 
Commercial Associates Co Ltd at the forefront with huge deals 
every fiscal year. 
  The company represented the makers of Stingray light tanks, 
the Spada anti-aircraft missile system, Bell Helicopters and AMX 
jet fighters, among others. The Stingray and Spada purchases 
proved embarrassing for the Army last year when defects were 
detected. In the end, the manufacturers agreed to carry out 
repairs free of charge. 
  When the deals for the Stingray tanks and Spada rockets were 
proposed in the late 1980s, top Army figures were strong in 
their support, saying they were appropriate for Thailand's 
defense capability. Key military figures of the time, such as 
Supreme Commander Gen Sunthon Khongsomphong and deputy Army 
chief Gen Wanchai Ruangtrakun, have all since retired and, as 
expected, none of them came forward to defend the equipment last 
year. 
  If the military genuinely wants to modernize its defense 
capability, it should have avoid weapons not in use in the 
armies of other countries [sentence as published]. For example, 
the military keeps on buying Bell combat helicopters which are 
no longer used by the US armed forces. At one time, they wanted 
to buy used helicopters decommissioned from the US forces, 
arguing that they were still in good condition having been 
repaired and refitted. [passage omitted] 
  A notable point is that the Thai armed forces have 
frequently 
been the "launch customers" of an item of defense equipment, 
such as the Stingrays. This raises the question whether there 
was something more involved than just a direct commercial 
arrangement. 
  It could be that many types af weapons purchased by Thailand 
were procured on the assumption that they would never be used in 
battle and whatever defects there might be would never be known 
to the public. Risks of exposure were considered minimal, 
except in the cases of bad luck or a power play among military 
figures. 
  The controversies surrounding the Stingray light tanks and 
the Spada missile system have proved otherwise -- that they were 
not the most modern or most suitable weapons, as claimed.

<F P=106> [From the "Sideline" column by Sophon Ongkon: "Chuan </F>
Government Loses Leverage with Military"] 
  [Text] The displeasure of the military top brass over the 
barter trade for arms must have startled the Chuan Cabinet. The 
impressive line-up of the armed forces leaders was an overkill 
for the increasingly beleaguered administrator which seems to be 
limping towards the end of the road. 
  What has inspired the military leaders to take such a bold 
move could be anybody's guess. Government weakness is a simple 
answer. To the public, this is indeed a bad sign. The upbeat 
statement on the barter trade made by the generals on Friday 
would have been unthinkable in the days after the May 1992 
bloodshed. 
  It was the worst moment for the administration which has 
been 
closeting itself in a self-woven political cocoon amidst the 
public criticism over its lacklustre performance. It cannot 
pick more fights, especially with the armed forces. The timing 
was good for the military chiefs because they know that not many 
people would want to side with the administration which has 
alienated itself from former allies and supporters. 
  They are also aware that the administration has been 
fighting 
on many fronts and struggling to stay in power. Its energy has 
been drained by inept handling of critical issues such as 
protest rallies staged by farmers and other victims of 
grievances while creating more adversaries in the same process. 
  Had the government been able to maintain a cordial 
relationship with public-interest groups, such as NGOs, 
academics, students, labour unions, and the Confederation for 
Democracy -- or even the press -- things would have turned out 
differently. The armed forces chiefs would have thought twice 
before flexing their muscles -- something quite unfamiliar 
during the past two years. 
  Alas, many cabinet members seen on television with sound 
bytes showed only sheepish smiles, while avoiding reporters' eye 
contact when they were pressed for their reactions to the 
military hyperbole. Obviously, it was not their day. The ego, 
inflated during the verbal duels with academics, seems to have 
shrunk considerably. 
  We suspect that the way the armed forces bosses thundered 
their statement, echoed through a spokesman, must have driven 
some cabinet members out of their wits. They might be fretting 
over a question: Would the doomsday for the government come so 
soon? 
  There was one positive aspect though, when we saw that the 
top brass behaved much less like bullies -- a style preferred by 
their predecessors. May be they know the current limits, and 
prefer to wait until the government can no longer function with 
enough credibility. 
  But that was still not enough. The commanders should have 
adopted a more subtle method, a low-keyed approach, in dealing 
with this issue. A quiet chat would have been sufficient to 
avoid unnecessary ill feelings and public concern when it looked 
more like a confrontation. 
  At the same time, their rejection of the government's 
proposal for a barter of agricultural products with defence 
procurement must be amply justified instead of saying just that 
such arrangements would be too complicated and unworkable. They 
cannot spend other people's money on their own will. 
  They should explain why. If they do not have much regard for 
the administration, they must still take the taxpayers into 
consideration. The people have become more wary. They 
certainly want to know who will be the eventual targets of the 
expensive firearms and other fearsome weaponry bought with their 
sweat and toil. There was a painful lesson for the people who 
had braved the bullets and batons on Ratchadamnoen Avenue two 
years ago. 
  The military leaders have to come up with some sort of 
assurance that the weapons they intend to acquire, with cash or 
other means, are not the defence equipment which have defects 
and fail to perform reasonably well in time of war as witnessed 
in the purchases of Stingray light tanks and the Spada air 
defence missile system last year. 
  Things have changed. The commanders have to learn to cope 
with the ongoing social evolution. At least a sense of 
accountability to the public should be instilled in the holders 
of public offices, no matter what branches in the government 
they are in. 
  If the commanders want arms to modernize their forces, they 
should produce credible proposals and allow more public scrutiny 
to display sincerity. These are also means to ensure that some 
fat-cat generals are barred from ill-gotten gains. An embracing 
excuse such as "national security" cannot impress the people all 
the time, especially those who are not gullible enough. 
  A fact is that there are no secrets anymore, even in the 
arms 
bazaar. All countries know what are being bought and sold, by 
whom and to whom, with the smallest of details and 
specifications. What remains a secret, or little known, is the 
extent of commissions, or kickbacks, given by arms merchants to 
grease the hands holding the pen to sign the procurement 
contracts. 
  All commercial transactions offer commissions, and only 
foolish buyers or traders would be unaware of the existence of 
kickbacks. This is a major factor which has enriched so many 
people involved in arms deals in our country in the past three 
decades. 
  This is no wonder at all. Many military officers with simple 
family backgrounds -- some as poor as church mice -- have been 
able to amass wealth before their retirement like acquire 
foreign assets and generously acting as political paymasters. 
  If Prime Minister Chuan and his administration think that 
the 
military show-off was in fact a bullying tactic, then they must 
show some spines themselves. Chuan's legendary razor-edged 
tongue must brave the menace of the bayonet. Beseeching should 
not be an alternative to a compromise. The taxpayers and nobody 
else, always have the final say with their money. They are 
entitled to a sensible explanation as well. 
  Who knows? If government leaders are willing to take the 
bull by the horns, cheering fans might emerge from somewhere to 
give them a push while temporarily burying their hatchets only 
for this particular incident. The last thing the government 
should do is underestimate the power of the people. 
  After all, the people know that the bull cannot be allowed 
to 
run amok and frighten the public so that it can gain more 
ground, and eventually dominate the whole arena again. 
  The government should not take pleasure in committing 
failures so much that it is producing another one.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The armed forces must always 
realize that the money used for the purchase of weapons comes 
from the national budget; that is, tax money collected from the 
people. Since the government cannot simply print banknotes, it 
must be careful and make sure that the money is spent properly. 
It is apparent that someone has profited from commission fees 
associated with every weapons purchase the armed forces have 
made. Hence, the thundering news conference held by the 
military top brass reminds us of the old saying: "A careless 
utterance tarnishes a good image."

  [Text] The three armed forces commanders have the 
democratic right to express their disagreement with the cabinet 
resolution on the purchase of G-22 transport planes, worth some 
3.4 billion baht, through barter trade. Soldiers are regarded 
as government officials who must comply with government policy, 
but it is good that they openly express their opinion about 
certain policies that they find impractical instead of keeping 
quiet and refusing to implement such policies, as some civil 
servants have been doing. 
  The three armed forces commanders, however, believe that 
this 
government harbors hatred against the armed forces and looks for 
any opportunity to bully them. They claim it is improper for 
the government to impose the same policy on the procurement of 
military hardware and materials as on the construction of public 
facilities such as the elevated electric train system. Things 
have now changed. We believe that the elevated electric train 
project is a higher priority than the weapons needed for the 
country's defense. There is currently not much of an external 
threat to national security, but the traffic problem has become 
a national issue. 
  It does not make sense to say that if we do not decide now 
the price of the planes will increase. It will not be difficult 
if the armed forces clearly understand the arms barter policy 
from the very beginning. They can agencies to help arrange 
purchases using this method. It is true that the armed forces 
have no expertise in this area, but the Commerce Ministry and 
several international firms can offer assistance. They know 
which countries produce what kinds of weapons and military 
hardware and what agricultural products they want. If the armed 
forces had only been a little more patient and had not revealed 
their position so hastily, the people would not have the feeling 
that there is a rift between the government and the military. 
  We support the government's endeavors to tackle the problem 
of low crop prices through the practice of barter trade. 
Although it might not work out perfectly, at least we will be 
able to sell our crops in cases of production surplus or falling 
prices. The armed forces should realize how this scheme can 
benefit our poor farmers. If they really cannot implement the 
policy, though, they should talk to the government and explain 
the possible adverse consequences. The government's intentions 
are good, but it has not spelled them out clearly to the 
agencies concerned. 
  It was not a surprise when the three armed forces convened a 
meeting and declared their disagreement with the government's 
arms barter policy, because they lack a clear understanding of 
it. It is necessary for the armed forces to study this policy 
thoroughly before they can implement it successfully. 
  We appeal to the government and the armed forces to try to 
reach an agreement on which level this policy should be applied 
at, and the fact that this is one method to help solve the 
problem of low crop prices. We must make sure that deals are 
carried out in a transparent manner and that nobody pockets 
commission fees, as repeatedly has happened in various agencies.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The United States Must Act With Fairness"] </F>
  [Text] A group of American companies late last week sent a 
petition to U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor indicating 
that Thailand is among the 36 countries with a gross violation 
of American copyrights. It says the private sectors in those 
countries were responsible for piracy of books, software, 
movies, and discs resulting in a loss of some 200,000 million 
baht to them. It is a pity the complaint did not give a 
specific figure about the damage caused by Thailand alone. 
  It is quite understandable why American companies complained 
-- they wanted their government to apply Section 301 of the U.S. 
Trade Act to penalize Thailand. Thailand is one of the 
countries on the priority watch list facing U.S. trade 
retaliation. It is possible the United States would take action 
against them the way it is doing with Japan for rejecting 
conditions offered by the United States to solve the problem of 
trade surplus -- Japan agreed to solve the problem, but not the 
way dictated by the United States. It also indicated it would 
take action before the G-7 meeting, or the meeting of the seven 
industrialized countries. That was Japan's condition. As for 
Thailand, it has no choice but to wait and see what decision the 
United States makes. This depends on how sincere and how 
serious Thailand is concerning its efforts to suppress copyright 
violations. 
  We think the Commerce Ministry has been trying hard to 
suppress copyright violations. There have been raids and 
seizures of pirated cassettes, and the products are destroyed. 
Legal actions have been taken against imitators. However, the 
rate of arrests might not be big enough for the American 
companies; otherwise they would not have complained to the U.S. 
Trade Representative. 
  So we think that to avoid U.S. trade retaliation Thailand, 
through the Commerce Ministry, should take action more seriously 
and consistently to stop copyright piracy. We must show to the 
United States that we did not remain oblivious to the problem, 
and thus the proposal by the American companies is not 
justified. The government must protect the interest of the 
nation against negative impacts caused by a handful of law 
violators. 
  Anyway, we would like to appeal to the United States to be 
fair. As Thailand is cracking down on the illegals, certain 
countries are abusing the copyright law to a greater extent. 
The United States did not show any concern. If this is allowed 
to continue, it would be unfair for those with their names on 
the U.S. priority watch list. 
  The United States realized what was going on, but it was 
reluctant to react because this involves a big country with a 
large population and a gross human rights violation. The United 
States closes its eyes and pretends not knowing what is going 
on. Can this be called a discrimination by the United States? 
  If the answer is no, that means the United States applies 
different rules to different countries.

  [Excerpts] Does the end of the American trade embargo 
against Vietnam mean an overnight miracle for Thai investors? 
Pathom Phanityanuson from the Foreign Trade Department does not 
think so. In a statement contradicting all the optimism 
prevailing in the business community since the embargo was 
lifted, he said, "the mutual trade value between Thailand and 
Vietnam is expected to decline, while the restrictions on 
commerce are likely to increase." 
  At yesterday's seminar on "The Trade and Investment Policy 
After the American Lifting of its Trade Embargo on Vietnam", 
Pathom appeared to be cautious about the positive anticipations 
of mutual trade ties between the two countries expanding. He 
said the end to the embargo would instead prompt the Vietnamese 
government to adjust its economic structure by promoting import 
ubstitutions and preserving the available raw materials for 
local investors. 
  In short, this would mean Thailand no longer being able to 
import raw materials like teak, minerals and ore from Vietnam, 
while Thai investors would find it more difficult to sell their 
goods. "The Vietnamese government will likely implement import 
restrictions via three measures; by setting high tariffs, 
introducing quotas and restricting the volume of imports in 
industries it is trying to promote," he said. 
  For example, the Vietnamese government recently announced it 
will be restricting 16 categories of imports. "Thai investors 
should therefore make a profound study before deciding to enter 
into any business in Vietnam," he suggested. [passage omitted] 
  In the short run, Pathom suggested Thai businessmen should 
adjust their business strategy to cope with the new investment 
promotions of the Vietnamese government. Instead of expecting 
to import only raw materials from this emerging economy, Thai 
investors should cooperate with local Vietnamese businessmen in 
areas where they can share expertise, such as processed-farm 
goods or textiles. "Else, we should act as a marketing gateway 
for Vietnamese sellers in the same way the Dutch resold Thai 
tapioca exports in the European market," he said. [passage 
omitted] 
  Dr Sutham Yu-Naitham said Thai investors would be 
well-positioned to participate in a wide range of services, such 
as hotels, distribution and human resource development. "Thais 
have somehow been overlooked [though they have] strong expertise 
in the service sector." he said. 
  Loxley Plc's Thongchai Lamsum, whose company is already in 
Vietnam providing household telephone services, thinks 
differently. While others identify hotels and tourism management 
as primary service industries for local investors to bring to 
Vietnam, he identified hospitals and fast food businesses as 
more likely to succeed. 
  "The Vietnamese have more purchasing power than we think 
they 
have," Thongchai said. Like others, he also identified the 
consumer products industry as a potential candidate for 
investment. He said others include computers and PABX telephone 
services, including installation and repair. 
  Narong Chiwangkun, the managing director of Kodak (Thailand) 
Co Ltd, seemed to agree with Thongchai's identification of 
potential industries Thais will be able to compete in. "[Were] 
Thailand a company and I its managing director, I would identify 
the industries we Thais are to go into Vietnam [with]. 
Industries which cannot compete need not to go there," Narong 
said. 
  Several of the speakers said both Bangkok and Hanoi still 
had 
certain problems that immediate remedies had to be found for. 
  On the Vietnamese side, problems usually identified are the 
difficult Vietnamese investment laws, red tape, inadequate 
infrastructure and poor management. 
  On the Thai side, Vietnamese investors seem to distrust 
their 
Thai counterparts. Thai investors, according to several 
speakers, were viewed as exploiters, rather than as good-willed 
investors. 
  Le Cong Phung, the Vietnamese Ambassador to Thailand, 
yesterday affirmed the lifting of U.S. embargo will not bring 
about a sudden explosion of economic development via U.S. 
investment there. 
  "Rather, it will psychologically relieve our friends to 
cooperate and invest in Vietnam," Phung said. 
  The ambassador emphatically said the new situation will not 
divert his government's foreign policy and economic relations 
with other countries, especially those in Southeast Asia. 
  "I can assure you we have and continue to encourage and 
promote the economic cooperation, trade and investment with 
Thailand. It is our consistent policy,'' he said.

  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai will lead a 
100-member delegation, including about 40 businessmen, on an 
official visit to Vietnam next month, Foreign Minister Prasong 
Sunsiri announced yesterday. The visit, from March 16 to 19, is 
at the invitation of Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, who visited 
Thailand last year. It was intended to follow up on previous 
agreements with Hanoi and to boost Thai-Vietnamese economic 
cooperation. Chuan will be the first head of government to visit 
Vietnam in the wake of the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo on 
Feb 3. 
  The premier will meet Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and pay a 
courtesy call on the Vietnamese Communist Party 
Secretary-General Do Muoi. Government officials will have a 
plenary meeting with their Vietnamese counterparts. Chuan also 
plans to visit the southern commercial city of Ho Chi Minh, 
Prasong said. 
  Matters expected to be raised by the visitors include 
fisheries cooperation and Vietnamese objections to the diversion 
of water from the Mekong River during the dry season, the 
central issue which has precluded a framework agreement on the 
development of the river between Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and 
Vietnam. [passage omitted] 
  Prasong said he expected memorandum of understanding (MOU) 
to 
be signed for an industrial development. Informed sources said 
the agreement will be between Thailand's Bangprakong Industry 
Park and Vietnam's State Committee for Co-operation and 
Investment, to develop industrial estates at Bien Hoa in Dong 
Nai province east of Ho Chi Minh City. The company was still 
negotiating over the size of the development and the price of 
the land, the source said. 
  Chuan's visit will be followed up by Deputy Foreign Minister 
Surin Phitsuwan, who is to attend the third meeting of the 
Thai-Vietnamese Joint Commission in the second half of the year. 
  Prasong, speaking at the opening of a seminar on trade and 
investment prospects in Vietnam, urged closer cooperation 
between the government and the private sector to reinforce the 
capability of Thai business to compete in Vietnam and other 
Indochinese markets. 
  He said the setting up of the Joint Commission, agreements 
on 
investment protection and promotion, and cooperation between the 
Board of Investment and Hanoi's State Committee on Co-operation 
and Investment has resulted in increased bilateral trade and 
investment. 
  Trade with Vietnam has risen from Bt 3.98 billion in 1992 to 
Bt4.18 billion in the first 10 months of last year. Up to the 
end of January, Thai investment in Vietnam was worth U.S. 
$141.96 million spread over 31 projects--ranking 12th among 
foreign investors. 
  In 1992, the government gave more than Bt 15 million in 
assistance to Vietnam for education, agricultural development 
and vocational training. Planned technical assistance to 
Vietnam from 1993 to 1995 totals Bt150 million. 
  Prasong said to attract investment Vietnam needs to urgently 
accelerate tax reform and improve state management of 
expenditure, education, the legal infrastructure, the banking 
system and liberalize the labour market. [passage omitted] 
  Thai businessmen in Vietnam yesterday urged Chuan to push 
for 
government-to-government agreement on an Indochinese Fund to 
give Thai businesses a competitive edge. Other suggestions 
included accelerating efforts to develop a transportation 
network though sea and land routes linking Thailand and Vietnam 
through Cambodia, to accelerate trade and tourism.

  [Text] The airport business in Thailand has long been the 
domain of government and public authorities, but Thai Aerospace 
Co Ltd (TASCO) plans to change this with the opening of the 
country's first "aviation colony", at a cost of about 1.5 
billion baht. The Eagle Space Airport along with TASCO's two 
other projects-- the Thai Aircraft Maintenance Co Ltd (TAMCO) 
and The Eagle Flying Club -- will be located on 1,400 rai in 
Ratchaburi province, 20 minutes' flying time from Bangkok. 
  Financial backing for the project has come from Nava Finance 
and Securities, Krung Thai Bank and a number of other financial 
institutions. 
  The airport will be the first general aviation airport and 
together the three projects will provide "integrated aviation- 
related services", according to TASCO managing director Prarom 
Mokawet. "There are some private airports in Thailand but they 
do not accommodate public planes. This airport will be the 
first one in the country to be registered with the civil 
aviation board for public use," said Mr Prarom. "We will be able 
to accommodate and maintain all `light' aircraft smaller than a 
Boeing 737," he said. 
  The initial runway will be 1.4 kilometres in length with two 
taxi ways, and facilities at the airport will be able to handle 
up to 400 planes. 
  A 155-room hotel and resort complex to be managed by the 
Radisson group will also be part of the Eagle Space Project. 
  At first the firm will concentrate purely on smaller private 
aircraft but if the project is successful it will consider 
enlarging facilities to accommodate large commercial aircraft as 
well. 
  At present maintenance of aircraft in the country can only 
be 
carried out by Thai Airways International, so many private 
aircraft are sent to Singapore for servicing, resulting in a 
loss of considerable revenue to Thailand. But, Mr Prarom pointed 
out, "the private sector in Thailand has never really ventured 
into any large-scale aviation ventures and since we are subject 
to Civil Aviation regulations we do not want to launch into a 
large-scale commercial airport that would be in competition with 
existing government ones. The aim is to support government 
aviation," he said. 
  As yet TASCO has no competitors but Mr Prarom believes that 
other groups will soon become very interested in establishing 
more private airports. 
  The second project, TAMCO, is an aircraft maintenance 
operation that will be a joint venture between TASCO and THAI. 
  "At present we are making a feasibility study in conjunction 
with THAI, who subject to agreement will be our partner in 
TAMCO," he said. Both partners would provide equipment, but THAI 
would provide personnel alone as it was very difficult to find 
highly-trained staff in the private sector, Mr Prarom said 
Maintenance will be available for all private aircraft as well 
as THAI and Bangkok Airways planes. The Eagle Flying Club for 
both local and foreign flying enthusiasts will provide equipment 
for pilots and flying lessons. 
  The completion date for the entire project has been set for 
late 1996 or 1997. 
  TASCO has future plans to establish helicopter ambulance 
services and to work in conjunction with both the police and 
traffic monitoring services.

  [Text] The Burapha Special Task Force has urged the Army's 
Scientific Department to immediately identify the substance 
contained in a tin box seized by a combined unit of police and 
military officers from three men last week. 
  The deputy commander of the Aranyaprathet task force unit, 
Col Itsara Watcharaprathip, said senior Army officers in Bangkok 
showed high interest in the box suspected to contain uranium. 
  The rusty box, which is 28 cms long, 21 cms wide and 6 cms 
deep and weighs about 4.2 kgs, bears a danger sign and a phrase 
in English which reads "1974-1994 Uranum 999x Made in USA 
2350827". 
  Col Itsara said he received an order from his superior to 
closely monitor the reported smuggling dangerous goods, 
suspected to be radioactive substances, and to try to prevent 
them entering the country. 
  He said he had an intelligence report that at least 10 
similar boxes weighing from one to five kgs were smuggled into 
Thailand and were sold to junk dealers for 200,000 to 1,000,000 
baht.

  [Text] In response to a KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY 
reporter's question concerning the recent final decision by us 
and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] on the scope 
of inspections for ensuring the continuity of safeguards, today 
a DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman gave the following answer: 
  An agreement was reached on the scope of the inspections for 
ensuring the continuity of safeguards at the negotiations held 
between us and the IAEA held in Vienna, Austria, on 15 February. 
  The inspections on which an agreement was reached at this 
time are not regular and irregular inspections [chonggimit 
pichonggi sachal] under the safeguards accord, but inspections 
corresponding to our special status since we had temporarily 
suspended the effectuation of our withdrawal from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty. And, their basic mission is to ensure 
the continuity of safeguards by confirming that the nuclear 
materials have not been used for other purposes since the 
previous inspections. This also complies with the spirit of the 
agreement reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact inic mission is to 
ensure the continuity of safeguards by confirming that the 
nuclear materials have not been used for other purposes since 
the previous inspections. This also complies with the spirit of 
the agreement reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact inic mission is 
to ensure the continuity of safeguards by confirming that the 
nuclear materials have not been used for other purposes since 
the previous inspections. This also complies with the spirit of 
the agreement reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact inic mission is 
to ensure the continuity of safeguards by confirming that the 
nuclear materials have not been used for other purposes since 
the previous inspections. This also complies with the spirit of 
the agreement reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact inic mission is 
to ensure the continuity of safeguards by confirming that the 
nuclear materials have not been used for other purposes since 
the previous inspections. This also complies with the spirit of 
the agreement reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact inic mission is 
to ensure the continuity of safeguards by confirming that the 
nuclear materials have not been used for other purposes since 
the previous inspections. This also complies with the spirit of 
the agreement reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact inic mission is 
to ensure the continuity of safeguards by confirming that the 
nuclear materials have not been used for other purposes since 
the previous inspections. This also complies with the spirit of 
the agreement reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact inic mission is 
to ensure the continuity of safeguards by confirming that the 
nuclear materials have not been used for other purposes since 
the previous inspections. This also complies with the spirit of 
the agreement reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact inic mission is 
to ensure the continuity of safeguards by confirming that the 
nuclear materials have not been used for other purposes since 
the previous inspections. This also complies with the spirit of 
the agreement reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact inic mission is 
to ensure the continuity of safeguards by confirming that the 
nuclear materials have not been used for other purposes since 
the previous inspections. This also complies with the spirit of 
the agreement reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York last 
29 December. 
  At the contact, the DPRK and the United States agreed that, 
as imminent measures to resolve the nuclear issue in a package 
deal, we would accept inspections necessary to ensure the 
continuity of safeguards and affirmatively examine working-level 
contact for the exchange of special envoys if the South Korean 
side so proposes, that the United States would declare the 
discontinuation of the Team Spirit joint military exercise for 
1994, and that the DPRK and the United States would jointly 
announce the date of the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  What had been stressed, in particular, in the agreement was 
that the inspections we would receive from the IAEA must be 
thoroughly [choltu cholmi] restricted to [kukhan] inspections 
for ensuring the continuity of safeguards. However, no 
agreement had been reached on the scope of the inspections 
because the IAEA Secretariat, completely ignoring the DPRK-U.S. 
agreement, had pressured us to receive complete [wanjonhan] 
regular and irregular inspections and because the United States, 
in a breach of faith [sinuirul choborigo], had unjustly defended 
the agency's Secretariat. 
  This had made us no longer entertain expectations from the 
DPRK- U.S. talks and express our official position that we had 
no alternative than to make a necessary choice. Then, the 
United States and the IAEA withdrew [cholhoe] their previous 
request for regular and irregular inspections on their own and 
stated that they would conduct inspections solely for ensuring 
the continuity of safeguards, and, as a result, the final 
decision on the scope of inspection could be made this time. 
  We welcome the fact that the United States and the IAEA 
Secretariat assumed an attitude conforming to the resolution of 
the issue and consented to the final decision on the scope of 
inspections for ensuring the continuity of safeguards. 
  What remains at present is to see what attitude the United 
States will assume on the practical stage of implementing the 
agreement between us and the agency. 
  When agreements on future simultaneous actions are reached, 
as promised between the DPRK and the United States, a phase will 
be opened for the IAEA's early inspections to guarantee the 
continuity of safeguards and for the holding of the third round 
of DPRK-U.S. talks to achieve a package solution to the nuclear 
problem. 
  At a time when the world is welcoming the recent agreement, 
only the U.S. rightist conservative forces and the Japanese and 
South Korean authorities are loudly saying that regular and 
irregular inspections must completely be conducted because the 
inspection scope agreed upon between the IAEA and us is not 
enough to verify the transparency of our nuclear activities 
[haek hwaltong], and are openly insisting on conducting even 
special inspections. This is no ordinary matter. They are 
insisting this not because they are unaware of the reality of 
the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. This is regarded as 
nothing but a deliberate scheme [uidojogin chakkan] to prevent 
the resolution of the nuclear issue and to drive the situation 
to an extreme. 
  As the special inspection issue is one of the primary 
reasons 
for the announcement of our withdrawal from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty, the continuous insistence on the 
special inspection is the same as an act aimed at pushing us 
completely out of the treaty. 
  The matter of regular and irregular inspections is an issue 
to be discussed within the scope of the method for a package 
solution to the nuclear problem when the third round of 
DPRK-U.S. talks are held, and it cannot be solved by loudly 
talking about it at present. 
  The United States must prevent the positive [kungjongjok] 
development of the situation from reversing itself by fulfilling 
its responsibilities and duties at this decisive moment 
[kyolchongjogin taemoge waso], which has come after a lot of 
trouble, and should contribute to the ultimate solution to the 
nuclear problem. 
  If the United States puts the brakes on the resolution of 
the 
nuclear issue again by setting unjustifiable conditions for 
agreeing on the simultaneous actions or sticking to applying 
pressure, the agreements reached between the IAEA and us cannot 
be implemented, nor another opportunity like the current one 
will come again. 
  We have invariably taken an independent policy [chaju 
chongchaek], and we all together will cope with any situation. 
We will continue to carefully watch the development of the 
situation.

<F P=106> ["DPRK FM Spokesman on Settled Scope of Inspection for </F>
Continuity of Safeguards" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 21 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
answered a question put by KCNA today as regards the recent 
definition of the scope of inspection to ensure the continuity 
of safeguards by the DPRK and the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA). 
  He said: 
  An agreement was reached on the scope of inspection for the 
continuity of the safeguards at the negotiations between the 
DPRK and the IAEA in Vienna on February 15. 
  The agreed inspection is not a routine or an ad hoc 
inspection under the safeguards agreement but an inspection 
proper to the specific status of the DPRK after the temporary 
suspension of its declared withdrawal from the Nuclear 
Non-proliferation Treaty. Its main purpose is to confirm the 
non-use of nuclear materials for other purpose after the last 
inspection and thereby ensure the continuity of the safeguards. 
His accords with the spirit agreed upon at the DPRK-U.S. 
contact in New York on December 29 last year. 
  At the contact the two sides agreed on immediate measures 
aimed at a package solution to the nuclear issue, whereby the 
DPRK would accept an inspection required for the continuity of 
the safeguards and affirmatively examine a possible proposal of 
the South Korean side for a working-level contact for an 
exchange of special envoys, while the United States would 
declare the cancellation of its "Team Spirit" joint military 
exercises in 1994, and the two sides would jointly announce the 
date of the third round of bilateral talks. 
  What was specially mentioned there was that the inspection 
of 
the DPRK by the agency should strictly be limited to one for the 
continuity of the safeguards. 
  However, the scope of inspection had not been decided upon 
so 
far because the IAEA Secretariat tried to force upon the DPRK 
full routine and ad hoc inspections, totally ignoring the 
DPRK-U.S. agreement and the United States unreasonably defended 
the Secretariat of the agency, breaking faith. 
  Under this situation, the DPRK could no longer count on the 
talks with the United States but was compelled to express its 
official position that it could not but make a necessary choice. 
  Such being the case, the U.S. and the IAEA Secretariat 
voluntarily withdraw their demand for routine and ad hoc 
inspections and said they would seek an inspection exclusively 
for the continuity of the safeguards, and this made it possible 
to decide upon the inspection scope. 
  We welcome that the U.S. and the IAEA Secretariat have 
agreed 
to the definition of the scope of inspection for the continuity 
of the safeguards, turning to a stance for the solution of the 
issue. 
  What remains to be seen is what attitude the United States 
will take in the practical stage of the fulfilment of the 
agreement between the DPRK and the agency. 
  If an agreement on the follow-up steps of simultaneous 
action 
is reached as promised between the DPRK and the United States, 
it will open a phase for the agency's early inspection for the 
continuity of the safeguards and, furthermore, for the opening 
of the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks and a package solution to 
the nuclear issue. 
  The world is now welcoming the recent agreement. However, 
the U.S. right-wing conservative forces and the Japanese and 
South Korean authorities alone are crying that full-routine and 
ad hoc inspections must be made and even openly demanding a 
"special inspection", arguing the inspection scope agreed upon 
between the DPRK and the IAEA is insufficient for verifying the 
transparency of the nuclear activities of the DPRK. This is a 
very ill-boding act. 
  This cannot be construed otherwise than a claim motivated by 
an intention to block the progress of the solution of the 
nuclear issue and lead the situation again to an extreme phase, 
not by their ignorance of how the issue stands on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  The "special inspection" is one of the main reasons that 
compelled the DPRK to declare its withdrawal from the Nuclear 
Non-proliferation Treaty and so the persistent demand for it is, 
in the final analysis, tantamount to an attempt to drive the 
DPRK out of the treaty. 
  The routine and ad hoc inspections are a matter which should 
be discussed within the framework of a package solution of the 
nuclear issue if the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks open. 
This matter will never be solved, even though they demand them 
now. 
  The United States should fully discharge its responsibility 
and obligations at this crucial moment which has been brought 
about with much trouble, thus checking the reverse of the 
present positive development of the situation and contributing 
to the final solution of the nuclear issue. 
  If the United States again put the brakes on a solution to 
the nuclear issue, attaching an unreasonable condition to an 
agreement on the steps for simultaneous action, or resorting to 
pressure, it would be impossible to implement the points already 
agreed upon between the DPRK and the IAEA and there would be no 
more chance as now. 
  We consistently follow a policy of independence. We will 
counter whatever possible cases. 
  We will continue to watch the future developments.

  [Text] The government is still prepared to send additional 
troops to Bosnia-Herzegovina under the proposal by the 
Organization of Islamic Conference [OIC]. Defense Minister 
Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak said however the government had not 
determined the strength of the troops. 
  He said the matter depended on the decision of the United 
Nations on whether or not to accept or reject the proposal. 
Malaysia also needs to hold discussions with OIC member 
countries in determining the strength of its troops and to find 
out their stand on the proposal. Najib said that he would also 
hold discussions with Pakistani Defense Minister Encik [Mr.] 
Aftab Shahban Mirani to find out his government's stand on the 
matter during his five-day official visit to the country from 25 
February.
