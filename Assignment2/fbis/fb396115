  [Text] As we said at the beginning of the newscast, the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly is currently meeting in Sarajevo 
behind closed doors. President Alija Izetbegovic of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency opened the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Assembly session with the following words: 
  Esteemed deputies, guests, and friends: I have a somewhat 
unpleasant duty to address you again on the issue of the Geneva 
negotiations, which have become [word indistinct] at which 
Bosnia meets its friends but also its enemies, both open ones 
and those concealed. The negotiations have become deadlocked 
and they are facing a collapse. That is why we are meeting 
today to exchange views and decide what to do. Perhaps some new 
ideas will be expressed in this hall today, which will point to 
a way out of this standstill and open up some new paths. 
  I therefore call on the deputies -- since they are the most 
informed and called upon as to what the people think -- to tell 
us their views and present new ideas that might encourage the 
negotiations. Let them do so bravely and freely, as this is a 
time of change and everything is (open) to suspicion and 
reassessment -- everything, that is, except some basic 
principles and the one aim, and that is the salvation of the 
people and the country. There are no taboos and nothing is 
politically sacred. 
  During the previous Geneva negotiations, our delegation 
consistently represented the views of the Assembly, as 
established at the session on 28 September 1993. We asked the 
Serb side to return the occupied territories in the Drina River 
valley and in western Bosnia. The Serbs made some concessions 
in eastern Bosnia, but they also took two steps back when it 
came to Brcko and Doboj. 
  The Croatian side persistently refused to accept the 
mutually 
satisfactory solution regarding our access to the sea at Neum. 
They offered solutions unacceptable to us near Prevlaka and in 
Peljesac. The Croats also rejected our proposal for a military 
disengagement in central Bosnia. We proposed that the HVO 
[Croatian Defense Council] forces pulled out from the region of 
Vitez and Novi Travnik, in which case the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Army units would also withdraw, and the civilian bodies and the 
UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] members would take control. 
Since they rejected this proposal, the confrontation near Vitez 
has continued. 
  The talks are to continue on 10 February. They are entering 
a critical phase. We expect a more active participation by the 
United States, which can only have a positive influence on the 
course of the negotiations. I believe that our delegation 
should be given full freedom to negotiate, but the Assembly 
would make the final decision. The delegation should represent 
the views of the Bosnia- Herzegovina Assembly of 28 September 
1993, but also take into account all the useful ideas and 
proposals that will be presented today by the deputies or the 
deputies' caucus. The delegation should also be authorized -- 
if no progress is made, and if it judges that the negotiations 
on this basis have become exhausted -- to request that the 
entire issue be referred to the UN Security Council. In that 
case, we would ask the Council to implement finally all the 
relevant resolutions on Bosnia-Herzegovina -- that is, we would 
remind the Council of its duty. I can see no other solution. 
  I do not think there is need to stress that our position at 
the negotiations depends to a large extent on our military 
situation, the strength or the weakness of the enemy, the morale 
and the limits of endurance of our people, the humanitarian 
conditions, and other elements. The state delegation has tried 
to be as objectively informed about these facts as possible, and 
it has tried within its limits to assess as realistically as 
possible these important factors. 
  Finally I would like to reiterate that our aim is peace but 
only just peace. All our efforts are devoted to this end, 
President Izetbegovic of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency said 
today in his opening address at the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly 
session.

<F P=106> [Address by Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris </F>
Silajdzic to the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly in Sarajevo on 7 
February -- live] 
  [Text] The assessment of the (five-month-long) activities 
of a government, its abilities and the correctness of its 
policies, would be a normal and routine democratic procedure in 
conditions of peace. However, in times of war, particularly in 
such times as face our country and people, this way of doing it 
is not common in democratic practice. This assembly is sitting 
in session, and this government is submitting a report on the 
first 100 days of work only about 300 to 400 meters from the 
front line, and this in a city in which over the last few days 
alone about 100 civilians have been killed and 200 wounded. 
  Under these conditions, 100 days to the people exposed to 
the 
horrors of war is a long time, while to the government of the 
country facing tremendous problems, it is a short time. There 
is a constant race with time. 
  Esteemed deputies, I would like to remind you that the new 
government took up duty under extremely hard conditions, 
characterized by a further escalation of the aggression with the 
open military engagement not only of Serbia and Montenegro, but 
also the Republic of Croatia; the catastrophic humanitarian 
situation, caused by the blockade imposed by both aggressors and 
the indecisiveness of the international community to eliminate 
that blockade; the deadlock of the peace process that is on the 
one hand the result of the aggressor's commitment to the war 
option, and on the other, the result of the lack of political 
will of the most important international protagonists to achieve 
the principles they set themselves in resolutions and other 
documents, and the devastated economic and financial system, the 
destroyed and badly damaged vital production capacities and the 
fractured economic ties between various parts of the country. 
This difficult situation has been further worsened by the 
problems created through the long- lasting obstruction by 
certain members of the previous government. This resulted in 
confusion and an interruption in the work of some ministries and 
certain segments of the government in general, and further 
caused the suspension of work of some significant state 
institutions at a time when their work was most needed. 
  Apart from that, there was the attempt at a separatist 
putsch 
in the Bihac region, and when the putsch was thwarted, the 
separatists stepped into open collaboration with the aggressor. 
One should certainly say that the formation of the new 
government was spearheaded by the consolidation of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, whose new configuration stood 
unified behind the concept of preserving the sovereignty and the 
territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and 
-- on that basis -- behind seeking political solutions in the 
peace process, while decisively resisting the aggression and 
strengthening the army and all the defense potential. 
  The formation of the new government was the result of such 
commitments, which opened the road to the creation of a 
qualitatively new atmosphere in the entire state structure. 
Under these conditions the government -- although according to 
the Constitution it is responsible for the situation in all 
spheres of life -- had to determine the priority tasks and 
aims, and for that reason it directed its activities in the 
following direction: Providing the most urgently needed means 
and conditions for the survival of the population during the 
winter period; strengthening the overall defense capacities of 
the country, with the stress on strengthening and developing the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army as the key factor of defense; 
undertaking measures for alleviating the very hard position of 
the refugees and the displaced people, and creating the climate 
for their return; adapting the economic and financial system to 
a war economy footing in order to place all the resources in the 
defense of the country and the survival of the population, and 
consolidating the state management and judiciary, and the 
advancement of justice in general, and particularly the personal 
and property security of all the citizens, and the protection of 
human rights, which is particularly important in times of war. 
Since the establishment of peace is the main, and within this 
government's program, the ultimate aim, the government has been 
intensely engaged in the efforts to get the peace process out of 
the impasse and steer it in the directions that offer the chance 
to establish a just and stable peace. 
  According to everything, the Geneva talks -- which imposed 
the wrong concept from the start -- are facing definite collapse 
as both the aggressors are using them as a smokescreen, while 
their real aim is to conquer and annex through war most of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina territory. I do not intend to elaborate here 
on the reasons for the failure of the peace process so far and 
the consequences of that failure, just as I will not elaborate 
on the concept of the peace initiative to be launched by our 
country since that is the issue to be addressed at a special 
point on the agenda of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly session. 
  Nevertheless, I would like to say that the government, 
within its sphere of competence, has invested enormous efforts 
to avoid the collapse of the peace process. Our diplomacy has 
been working very intensively in this direction. It sought and 
obtained political support and specific help from friendly 
countries. It insisted in the United Nations, the European 
Union, NATO, and other relevant international organizations and 
institutions to carry out the principles that the international 
community has set itself. It spread the truth about 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, it mobilized the world public to act by 
applying pressure against the inertia and hypocrisy of the 
political establishments of their countries. 
  At the same time, we thoroughly analyzed possible solutions 
and intensively sought ways of accepting all options that are 
offering at least the minimum of justice and prospects for 
stable peace. However, at no time have we ever considered 
accepting capitulation. It appears that this is what is being 
asked of us. 
  We are deeply aware that with this kind of attitude by 
certain members of the international community we have as many 
chances of achieving peace as our army and our people 
demonstrate strength, decisiveness, and success in the struggle 
for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Although sincerely committed to peace, we 
had to invest the maximum of effort to further develop and 
strengthen our defense capabilities. 
  Within its sphere of responsibility, the government has 
taken 
specific measures concerning the creation of a unified system of 
financing defense and providing logistical support, because the 
unintegrated systems in some communes or districts have not only 
been ineffective but also suited the unacceptable concepts of 
waging a defense war inside the country and within local 
communities, while neglecting the global interests of the 
country. 
  Within the development of the global concept for securing 
funds for the needs of the defense, at the proposal of the 
government we adopted a decision on a tax for defense and 
rebuilding of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This tax is 
expected to produce significant results, especially in regard to 
the material contributions by our workers employed abroad. 
  The characteristic of this war is that the aggressors have 
been attacking civilian targets with all their might, and that 
the mass killing of civilians has become an integral part of the 
aggressors' strategy. Despite the fact that we have been taking 
certain measures for the protection of the civilian population, 
it is obvious that this is becoming a task of the greatest 
importance. In this respect the government has already set 
directives for the work of the Defense Ministry, the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs, Civil Defense, and other institutions of the 
system. 
  We have achieved significant results in the development of 
our defense forces. We certainly do not want to create 
illusions that we are equal to the aggressor in regard to 
military equipment. On the contrary, the unjust embargo has 
considerably impaired our defense capabilities. However, 
regarding manpower, the organization of the system of command, a 
high combat morale, and the mobilization of all potentials on 
which the defense depends, we created not only a respectable 
army but also an increasingly sound system of defense as a 
whole. This is of crucial importance for further course of the 
war and the further course and outcome of the peace process, 
because we take the view, we are sure that a solution can no 
longer be imposed on us with the aggressors' military means. 
The international community is becoming aware of this, and so 
is the aggressor himself. This means that in the future the 
peace process must embark on the path of finding a formula for a 
genuine peace, and not capitulation. 
  Regarding the provision of conditions and means for the 
survival of the population in the winter period, I must say that 
the results achieved so far are not proportionate to the 
enormous efforts invested by the government in this respect. 
The activities of the government on securing funds for the 
survival of the population were primarily directed at the issues 
concerning the delivery of humanitarian aid, the mobilization of 
natural resources and available facilities for the production 
and distribution of food, and finding energy resources. 
  Through its relevant ministries the government has also 
undertaken measures needed to implement the plan for spring 
sowing in 1994 and to activate facilities for the quick 
production of food. The key causes of the critical humanitarian 
situation lie in the fact that the aggressor is using the 
humanitarian situation to achieve his war aims, which cannot be 
achieved on the battlefields. At the same time, some 
protagonists in international politics are using the grave 
humanitarian situation as a means of applying pressure on the 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina to accept solutions that suit 
certain powers in this region. We told the international 
community this openly at our extraordinary session. 
  The (?lack) of resolve by the international community to 
carry out the resolutions on the military protection of the 
convoys and ensure the safety of relief routes, and the 
reluctance on the part of UNPROFOR to carry out at least the 
measures that it was empowered to do by the otherwise inadequate 
mandate, I repeat the inadequate mandate, have contributed 
toward the amount of humanitarian aid that has been delivered 
being well below the existential minimum. 
  For these reasons, the government held an extraordinary 
session from which it sent a message to relevant international 
institutions and the entire world public to prevent a human 
catastrophe. This call has met with a positive response and the 
first results can already be felt. 
  After this objective criticism, one should say that we 
appreciate the efforts made by UNPROFOR, UNHCR, and other 
humanitarian organizations in practice. We are aware that 
without them, with their involvement, the situation would have 
been much more difficult. I particularly positively assess the 
delivery of aid with parachutes. This was the only way to 
(?send aid) to some areas that are completely surrounded. 
Although the humanitarian situation is critical in almost all 
regions that are under the control of the legal organs of the 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, it is nevertheless precisely 
because of the persistent and organized efforts by the 
government that certain progress has been made, and an even 
worse situation avoided, at least for the time being, which was 
our aim. 
  In our effort to transform the economic and financial system 
with quick and resolute moves, and adapt it to the demands of 
the war economy, the government has instructed the relevant 
departments to draw up a list of all available resources and 
facilities on the free territories in the shortest possible time 
so that they could be included in the system of defense for 
survival in an organized and coordinated way. Then, they were 
instructed to establish our energy resources and the minimum of 
needs for electric power, coal, oil, oil products, gas, and 
other energy resources, as well as embark on the revitalization 
and reconnection of the electric power system. 
  In addition, the government has outlined complex measures to 
identify social capital as state capital in order to protect it 
from illegal misappropriation and use it more efficiently for 
the needs of defense. These solutions are of a transient 
nature. The ultimate objective is the privatization of capital 
when objective conditions have been created for it. The tasks 
that have been set in this respect have already been partly 
accomplished, or work on their realization is intensively under 
way. 
  When the government presented its program in the inaugural 
session, we promised that we would approach the issues of the 
status and subsistence of the families of our soldiers and the 
killed and wounded members of the armed forces, and other 
victims of the war, with special attention and responsibility. 
In a relatively short period of time we adopted regulations and 
secured funds to solve these issues, at least partly, through 
special pensions, the payment of pensions and other income in 
kind, the establishment of a system of care and education for 
the children of members of the armed forces killed, and the 
provision of accommodation and other appropriate measures. 
This, of course, is only a small part of the responsibility 
that we took upon ourselves, and these issues will remain the 
priority in the future work of the government. 
  Regarding refugees and displaced persons, and the creation 
of 
conditions for their return, we have embarked on the drafting of 
regulations and setting up appropriate institutions so that this 
complex and long-tern problem could be dealt with systematically 
and in an organized way, not only as a humanitarian and social 
problem, but as a strategic issue for which the state of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is responsible. 
  The issue of organizing the functioning of the health 
service in times of war -- the kind of war waged by the 
aggressors against the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- is 
extremely important. The government has not had much leeway for 
solving these issues, as all the problems present in the 
humanitarian situation and aid in general are reflected in the 
health service. The blocking of the humanitarian aid has had 
extremely dire consequences on the health service. The 
international community has been tolerating with incredible 
indulgence the open threats by the aggressors in connection with 
the delivery of medicine, sanitary and medical equipment, and 
the evacuation of the wounded. Our doctors and other medical 
staff have been working miracles in extreme hardship and without 
the most basic conditions. However, thanks to friendly 
countries, we have managed to obtain a minimal amount of 
medicine and sanitary materials. The arrival of the field 
hospital in Mostar will alleviate at least partly the 
intolerable conditions under which the wounded and the sick are 
treated in the free part of that city. 
  Esteemed deputies, times of war are not very favorable for 
any spectacular moves by the government in the fields of 
culture, science, or education. We have tried, through the 
appropriate ministries, to maintain the continuity of the 
education process in the conditions of war, primarily keeping in 
mind the security of the students, as the schools have become 
the aggressor's favorite targets. We have also undertaken 
measures to protect the staff, equipment, and other facilities 
in the sphere of science from further destruction. 
  As for culture, we have a phenomenon here worthy of 
attention. Despite the extremely unfavorable conditions, 
cultural life is not only being preserved but is also being 
promoted in European and international circles. That is one of 
the spheres that the government does not encourage much owing to 
its objectively limited resources. However, the cultural 
workers obviously understand this and are putting more into it 
than could be realistically expected. 
  As for the sphere of information, the most important 
activities of the government have been directed at providing 
factual and expeditious information to the domestic and 
international public about all the relevant events in the 
country. Through staffing, and the financial and technical 
strengthening of the media, the government has also tried to 
provide for their integration into a overall system. Through 
agreements with governments of friendly countries, and countries 
that have received our refugees, and through other forms of 
support and means, particularly Radio Television 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as the most profuse media, the government 
will do everything possible under the circumstances to enable 
information from the republic to reach the world. This has not 
been the case as yet. 
  Parallel with the intensive engagement in the peace process, 
the government has taken into account overall foreign policy, 
which is of particular importance under the circumstances. Our 
bilateral activities have been very intensive. We have been 
visited by the prime ministers of Pakistan and Turkey, foreign 
ministers of Turkey, the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, and 
Croatia, and a number of ministers in charge of humanitarian 
aid, parliamentary delegations, other prominent politicians, and 
other prominent personalities and intellectuals from all over 
the world. As prime minister, I have visited Turkey, Pakistan, 
the United Arab Emirates, Germany, Austria, Belgium, and 
Croatia. Our foreign minister has visited Hungary, Italy, 
Belgium, France, Turkey, Germany, and Austria, and has taken 
part in the work of the CSCE and the CEI [Central European 
Initiative]. The ministers for education, health, economics, 
and interior affairs have also made some important trips abroad. 
As for the next period, we have arranged visits to our most 
important partners, who influence the peace process in various 
constructive ways, or who give us their support and aid in 
preserving the independence and integrity of our country. The 
government has devoted a lot of attention to promoting relations 
with other countries. So far 75 countries have recognized 
Bosnia- Herzegovina, while diplomatic relations have been 
established with 45 of them. Eighteen countries have accredited 
ambassadors to Sarajevo. Bosnia-Herzegovina has opened 22 
embassies, three missions within international organizations, 
and three general consulates. The public knows little about 
this, but it is of great importance for Bosnia-Herzegovina that 
it has become a member of a large number of international 
organizations over the period that this report covers, from 
UNESCO, the UN Food and Agricultural Organization, the 
International Organization for Intellectual Property, the 
International Organization for Migration, and so on. Our country 
is a signatory to 172 international multilateral agreements and 
systems of the United Nations, and another 34 are being 
processed. The procedure of ratifying 16 conventions within the 
Council of Europe is under way. We have recently signed 
agreements on friendly cooperation with Pakistan and Turkey, 
while activities aimed at signing bilateral agreements with a 
number of other countries are in progress. 
  The government believes that the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly 
should debate at one of its next sessions the strategic 
directions for our foreign policy engagements. The government 
will prepare an adequate platform for that. I would like to 
point out that over the last three months the government has 
undertaken concrete steps on the consolidation of the state's 
administration, the judiciary, and the advancement of law. The 
government was formed according to the criteria of competence 
and ability, but also that of its members' loyalty to the 
struggle for the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. In a 
relatively short time the republic's management has been 
successfully reorganized, and all the ministries have been 
changed to enable them to carry out their duties more 
efficiently. We have been working intensively and with some 
success on establishing effective vertical links among the state 
bodies, starting from the republic, through the regions to the 
communes, where the links had considerably weakened, and in some 
parts hardly existed. In that sense the establishment of 
ministerial coordinators for certain regions has proven useful. 
Apart from the constant presence of these ministerial 
coordinators, the practice is being established that other 
ministers and government officials should also frequently tour 
all the territories under our control, that is, under the 
control of the legitimate authorities. We will continue to 
develop this practice as it is one of the ways of overcoming 
occurrences of autarchy, individualist activities of local 
bodies, and in some cases disintegrating moves that weaken the 
necessary unity. 
  The government is speeding up its work on preparing 
regulations and other measures with which one would carry out 
certain changes in organizing the state structure, so that the 
state could function in a united way over the entire free 
territory and in the enclaves that are difficult to reach or 
those that are completely surrounded. We have demonstrated 
resolution in suppressing all forms of lawlessness and it is not 
immodest if I say that in strengthening the personal security of 
all citizens and security of their property, the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs, the security organs of the Defense Ministry 
and the Army, judicial organs and other institutions of the 
system have made radical moves. Of course, I am far from 
claiming that the present situation is good, but it is a fact 
that there is a positive state of legality and that the state of 
personal security of all citizens and the security of their 
property cannot be compared with the situation that the 
government had been faced with at the beginning. 
  At the end of this expose, ladies and gentlemen deputies, I 
want briefly to present the basic aims of the government in the 
coming period. You have been given the program of work of the 
government and have the opportunity to observe and assess its 
topicality, the volume of work, and the significance of the 
(?tasks) that the government is facing. You have also been 
given the detailed programs of work as well as reports on the 
work of all ministries. We are probably facing a decisive period 
in which not only the further fate of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and its peoples, but also the fate of every 
individual on this territory will depend. 
  The government is not going to change the basic concept of 
its policy. Our intention is to be a government that will 
achieve peace. In this respect, we are going to continue to 
make efforts and seek solutions that lead to the end of war. 
Because, nobody has more interest to achieve peace than we do, 
as the war is hitting us worst. In doing so we shall continue 
to seek support and cooperation of the international community, 
but we also remain open for dialogue with those political forces 
in Serbia and Croatia that are not being behind the great-state, 
nationalist, and conquering projects involving our republic. 
Vital links do not exist only between Bosnians, Croats, and 
Serbs in the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. All peoples in the 
countries that appeared on the territory of the former 
Yugoslavia have interests in peace, prosperity, and mutual 
cooperation. This is the meaning of our call to the Republic of 
Serbia, the Republic of Montenegro, as well as other 
internationally recognized states that came into being in the 
wake of the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia, to make 
decisions on mutual recognition. It is on this basis that 
everybody is given prospects that would replace war, hatred, 
killing, destruction, and poverty. 
  You are, however, still (?facing) aggression which is not an 
ordinary war, but genocide -- a lot has been said about it here 
-- and destruction of all civilizational, spiritual, and 
material achievements. As long as this aggression is going on 
we have to oppose it, we must defend ourselves, because it is 
the natural right of every state and every man. We do not need 
the army to conquer foreign territories, but are going to do 
everything with a view to having an army that would successfully 
defend the territorial integrity of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. These are invariable points in the 
government's policy, esteemed deputies, which it presents in 
this report to you, and I suggest to you to support us in this 
respect. Thank you.

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, 7 Feb (TANJUG) -- At a news conference 
in Sarajevo today, Srpska republic president Radovan Karadzic 
described the U.S. Administration's request that Saturday's 
crime at a Sarajevo market be investigated as "based on 
principles." [passage omitted] 
  Commenting on the talks yesterday with Akashi, Stoltenberg, 
and Owen, Karadzic said that a draft agreement on placing 
Sarajevo under a UN protectorate and on putting an end to the 
fighting in the area had been a good idea, but that it had never 
been signed due to the behavior of the Muslim side. 
  "We are ready to revive this issue in Geneva on 10 February 
in order to reach a partial peace, since the solution of the 
Sarajevo issue would lead to the resolution of the conflict in 
other areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina too," Karadzic said. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Srpska republic president Radovan Karadzic has held 
a news conference. He said that the Serbian side had a 
legitimate right to defend itself by all means. If we are 
attacked from the air, we would not suffer the strikes with our 
arms crossed, said Radovan Karadzic, who demanded a thorough 
investigation of the Sarajevo tragedy: 
  [Begin Karadzic recording] The reaction of the [UN] 
secretary general and the entire international community to the 
tragic massacre in the Sarajevo market is precisely the way the 
Muslims expected it to be. Such a reaction particularly 
encourages the Muslims to repeat this massacre, which is not the 
first in a series of massacres that have occurred with the aim 
of compromising the Serbs. 
  We fully understand the emotional side of all this. We are 
disgusted by this crime and condemn it most adamantly, calling 
resolutely for an international commission consisting of the 
experts from countries that are in no way interested in the 
outcome of the entire crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, for example, 
the Russians, the Japanese, the Indians, and the Chinese, with 
one Muslim and one Serbian representative. We not only demand a 
ballistic analysis, we also demand a forensic analysis, that is 
to say, that an international and objective commission of 
forensic experts determines the reasons and the time of death of 
all these victims. Namely, we have had some indications that all 
in all this has been staged to disrupt the international 
community. Not merely this incident, but any further incidents 
must, in our opinion, be investigated thoroughly by an objective 
commission, which will naturally also comprise one Serb and one 
Muslim. Only in such a way will the international community not 
stumble in the dark in search of the culprit. 
  Regarding the attack, even if the Muslim side is responsible 
for it, that is, if the UN firmly establishes that the Muslim 
side is responsible, it is perfectly clear to us that the Muslim 
side has done it, I do not know what good air strikes would do. 
I think that it is much better to have a commission and 
international pressure exerted on those who avoid a political 
solution and, on the eve of each conference, commit great crimes 
in order to sabotage the peace conference. 
  We shall not make the political negotiations more difficult 
in any way. We are interested in accomplishing peace as soon as 
possible. We have had some indications so far that a bomb could 
have been thrown from a nearby building, that this bomb alone 
was not of 120-mm caliber, but was wrapped in a great quantity 
of plastic explosive and, as such, thrown from the 21 Decembar 
building nearby. Naturally, we must work further on the proof, 
and it would be the best if the expert group consisting of 
ballistics and forensic experts concentrates on an examination 
of the reasons and circumstances of this massacre, which we 
highly praise, be correctly informed. [sentence as heard] 
  We shall do our best to inform them correctly of everything 
that is happening. The Serbian side has a legitimate right to 
defend itself by all means. If we are attacked from the air, we 
will defend ourselves by all means and would not tolerate 
strikes without defense. [end recording]

  [Text] Sarajevo, 7 Feb (TANJUG) -- "The Serb side has a 
legitimate right to defend itself with every available means; if 
we are attacked from the air we will not sit idly by," president 
of the Srpska republic Radovan Karadzic said at a news 
conference this evening. 
  "We now have firm control of our army and we can guarantee 
the safety of foreigners in our republic, but in the event of an 
attack elements of chaos would emerge and I am not sure that any 
foreigners in Bosnia-Herzegovina would be safe -- not because we 
would issue such orders, but because the people would treat 
foreigners as enemies, which they really would be, in a way," 
Karadzic said. 
  Speaking about the letter sent to NATO by UN Secretary 
General Butrus-Ghali, Karadzic said that such a reaction in fact 
encouraged the Muslims to reapply the same war methodology, for 
-- as he put it -- this was not the first massacre, and it was 
established that some had been committed by the Muslims 
themselves [sentence as received]. Karadzic said that the Serbs 
completely understand the emotional side of this tragedy, which 
they have condemned in the most vehement terms. 
  "We demand a rigorous investigation to identify the 
perpetrators of the crime -- once that has been done the 
international community will not have to grope in the dark. 
This is why this case should be investigated in great detail, 
not only from the ballistic, but also from the forensic aspect 
for there are some indications that this was another case of a 
stage-managed event," President Karadzic said.

  [Text] In an interview for a Netherlands daily, DE 
VOLKSKRAND, Momcilo Krajisnik, president of the Assembly of the 
Srpska republic, spoke, among other things, about the massacre 
that took place in Sarajevo on Saturday [5 February]. 
  [Begin Krajisnik recording] We do not have any information 
at present. The only thing that we know is that the Serbian 
side did not do it. However, we have some indications, 
suspicions, that there is even a possibility of this having been 
committed by a third side, neither the Serbian nor the Muslim 
side, but a side that does not want an agreement to be reached 
between the Muslims and the Serbs. We had been on a very good 
way to signing a document similar to the document and the 
statement signed between the Serbs and the Croats, and just at 
the time of this rapprochement, we found ourselves in the 
situation of these talks being undermined. We cannot say what 
forces these are. There are too many interested parties that 
would want the war to continue here and that do not want 
rapprochement between the Muslims and the Serbs. [end recoding]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with General Milan Gvero, deputy chief </F>
of the general staff of the Srpska republic army, by Slobodan 
Jankovic; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Jankovic] Mr. General, are there any new results 
in the investigation concerning the perpetrators of the massacre 
in Sarajevo? 
  [Gvero] We do not have any new results, except what has 
already been said in connection with this obviously staged 
massacre by the Muslims. As you know, the representatives of 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] were also unable to say anything 
more specific, because, really, they have nothing new to say. 
If they did have something to say this time, it appears this 
would have to be only in terms of an explanation and 
clarification that the Serbian side is not involved in this in 
any way. 
  [Jankovic] How do you explain the refusal by both the Muslim 
side and General Ramsey for you to set up a joint commission of 
experts? 
  [Gvero] The reason for this most probably lies in the fact 
that the Muslims think that the analyses of an impartial 
commission would prove that they staged the incident. This is 
why they did not accept it. When the news of the massacre was 
first aired, we were in the airport building and immediately 
suggested that a joint commission be set up. They rejected it 
15 minutes later. They obviously hold the view that the 
findings of an impartial commission would not support them and 
are therefore rejecting it. 
  [Jankovic] Mr. General, what does such a bloody move -- the 
shelling of civilians causing worldwide indignation -- mean from 
a military point of view? 
  [Gvero] I am sure that this primarily means the prolongation 
of the Muslim war option, their lack of readiness to make steps 
toward peace, and the encouragement of their belief that they 
can solve something with war, by prolonging the war, probably 
counting on some encouragement and support from outside. 
  There is not a single rational reason as to why they would 
do 
this, why civilians would be killed by those who are supposed to 
be protecting them, not killing them. However, when one thinks 
about it, one can see that they have support for such a course 
of action in Alija's Islamic Declaration, which clearly states 
that as far as a religious war is concerned, such as the one 
they are waging now, sacrifices are not important and neither 
are the numbers nor the quality.

  [Text] What prompted the Serb fascists to commit a new and 
by far the largest massacre of civilians since the outbreak of 
the war is a challenge for all conscientious analysts. The 
chetniks knew that -- upon seeing the large number of killed and 
badly wounded people at the Markale market -- the U.S. 
Government would immediately hold an extraordinary session and 
that the demands by the international community for air strikes 
against the positions of Karadzic's Serbs would become more 
urgent. They not only decided to lob the shell on the place 
where most of the Sarelians gather, but they did it 
deliberately, following a detailed project concocted not in 
Pale, of course, but in Belgrade. 
  So what was the real motive for this crime? This is the 
topic of today's editorial commentary. 
  [Unidentified commentator] Some believe that this was a 
desperate move, as all the chetnik offensives have been crushed, 
and the Croatian Council in Sarajevo (has broken off ties) with 
Mate Boban, Karadzic's main ally in the partitioning of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Others believe that this was an attempt to 
provoke our negotiators into giving up in Geneva. [sentence as 
heard] Others -- and most foreigners are in this group -- 
believe that this is the culmination of the psychological 
pressure exerted on Sarelians to give up further resistance. 
  The majority of people, however, believe that this was 
really 
a manipulation with the Serbs, this time devilishly planned. 
Such a monstrous crime in front of the entire world community 
is meant to cut off any retreat that the forcefully mobilized 
youths in Karadzic's army might have, youths who have realized 
what a bloody mess they have been forced into. The message to 
them is: Try to go over to the other side. After such a crime, 
the Muslims will slaughter you. 
  There is, of course, no need to mention that this shell, 
just 
like all the previous ones fired at Sarajevo, wanted to provoke 
hatred and retaliation against the Serbs who are Bosnian 
patriots, particularly those in Sarajevo. These Serbs have 
shown the world that coexistence is possible; the entire concept 
of greater Serbia collapsed on that. Analysts say that 
Milosevic, Karadzic, and the rest of their gang hate no one as 
much as they do these honorable and proud people. 
  However, even though all these reasons stand, the main 
reason 
is of a political nature. Milosevic has promised the 
impoverished, hungry, and miserable Serbians that the sanctions 
will be lifted soon and that normal life will resume. Now he 
has to tell them that the worst is yet to come. Since the 
Serbian regime and their puppets in Pale will never voluntarily 
return the territories laid to waste through an act of genocide 
and give up new conquests and crimes, the tightening of 
sanctions is inevitable, while air strikes against their 
positions still remain a possibility. Try to put yourselves in 
the shoes of the Serbian rulers now when they have to explain to 
the people who is to be blamed for their catastrophic situation. 
Since the rulers of the fascist regime treat their subjects as 
if they were mentally retarded, their explanation is: Well, see, 
the Muslims have again massacred their own people and caused the 
wrath of the international community against the Serbs. That was 
how they explained the introduction of the sanctions. According 
to them, the sanctions had nothing to do with Serbia's 
aggression, massacres of defenseless people by the heavily armed 
Serb army, concentration camps, and the mass liquidation of camp 
inmates. According to them, the sanctions were imposed after 
the allegedly plotted massacre of one own's people on Vase 
Miskina Street in May 1992. 
  The circle of lies, deceits, and crimes of the greater 
Serbian fascists is now closed, and the Markale market and the 
scene of the Vase Miskina Street massacre are near each other, 
very near. They are barely 100 meters apart, and they will be a 
monument to the evil, brutality, and corruption of this new type 
of fascism. Symbolically, this is an act much stronger than the 
burning of the Reich Stag and the false Polish attack on the 
German border post, as engineered by Hitler's Nazis.

  [Excerpt] Mate Boban, president of the Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna, placed the office of president at the disposal of 
the assembly until further notice at an extraordinary session of 
the chamber of deputies of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. 
  [Begin Boban recording] I have decided to place the office 
of 
president of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna at the disposal 
of the assembly until further notice. My duties will be carried 
out by the presidential council which will appoint one of its 
members to represent the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. [end 
recording] 
  Explaining his decision, Boban said that the most 
influential 
international players have been misled due to a lack of 
information and he believes that certain politicians, and not 
the will of the Croat nation, stand in the way of a 
multicultural, multiethnic, and unitary Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
This belief of the international public, which leads to growing 
pressure on the Republic of Croatia, is the reason why Boban had 
offered to resign. 
  [Begin Boban recording] I am saying this at the beginning so 
that those who believe in other interpretations in the Croat 
nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina would not describe this as a result 
of [word indistinct]. [end recording] 
  I will stay with you, Boban said at the end of his speech, 
in 
which he recalled that the will of the Croat nation in Bosnia- 
Herzegovina was defined two years ago in a referendum formulated 
in Livno, which approved Bosnia-Herzegovina, not as a unitary 
state but as one in which the Croat nation would have equal 
rights and the right to self-determination. We still support 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as a union of three republics, because we 
enabled it to survive by defending 35 percent of its territory. 
However, the Serbs and the Muslims do not want this 
Bosnia-Herzegovina anymore. 
  Boban also mentioned the meetings of self-proclaimed Croat 
assemblies and he said that this assembly is the only legitimate 
representative of the Croats' will in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Excerpts] The extraordinary session of the chamber of 
deputies of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna began at 1000 in 
the packed hall of the People's University in Livno. Members of 
former chamber of citizens of the Bosnia-Herzegovina assembly 
are also present at the session as well as members of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency Miro Lasic, Franjo Boras and 
Fikret Abdic. Representatives of the Catholic Church in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, municipal governments of Herceg-Bosna and 
numerous organizations of the Croat nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
are also present. 
  Members of the state delegation of the Republic of Croatia, 
headed by Minister of Foreign Affairs Mate Granic are also 
attending the session. [passage omitted] 
  There is only one item on the agenda: the current military 
and political situation of the Croat nation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina's struggle for its rights and survival. In 
his introductory speech, the president of the Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna and the Croat Democratic Community of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mate Boban, recalled that two years ago the 
well-known Livno referendum question was formulated which 
rejected the unitary organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
proclaimed the basic will of the Croat nation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina: Equal rights and a right to 
self-determination. Boban said that this basic goal had not 
been abandoned.

<F P=106> [Mladen Bosnjak report on news conference by the assembly of </F>
Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats in Sarajevo on 7 February -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Bosnjak] The assembly of the Croats of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina was successfully organized and went well. 
Some 595 participants were invited, 35 of whom were guests. 
Some 362 participants took part in the session here in 
Sarajevo, 26 of the invited participants were in Zenica on a 
direct telephone line. Twenty-two participants arrived from 
Zagreb, four from Germany, and four from the United States. 
  The assembly adopted several documents -- the decision on 
the 
negotiations for the solution to the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the decision on the participation of Croats 
in the representative bodies and bodies of authority, and the 
declaration of the Council. A Croatian National Council was also 
formed as the executive body of the assembly of the Croats in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The assembly presented a completely concrete proposal for 
the 
future organization of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The 
assembly participants claim that this proposal does not support 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as a unitary republic, that it is not at the 
detriment of the Serbs in the territorial sense, that it annuls 
all the excuses the aggressor found for carrying out the 
aggression, and that it offers a territorial organization that 
enables the return of the refugees and the evicted people. 
  [Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency member] Ivo Komsic, chairman 
of the Croatian National Council, told the correspondents about 
the territorial organization of the republic, the structuring of 
the state authority -- starting from communes, to cantons, and 
possible republics -- and the necessary federal authorities. 
  [Komsic] The Croatian assembly that took place yesterday 
adopted a concept of a reorganization of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
which could remove the causes of the war, which could remove the 
reasons behind the conquests of other people's territories -- 
that is, the Bosnia-Herzegovina territory -- as the fundamental 
cause of the war. This map shows that. These numbers depict 
these territorial units in a three-level federal state -- as we 
propose for Bosnia-Herzegovina -- which represent full 
autonomous units or cantons, and they would be directly 
connected with each other through the Federal Assembly. The 
authorities would, therefore, be unified but broken down into 17 
autonomous units, while Sarajevo, Mostar, and Banja Luka as 
extra territorial status as the most important and largest 
cities in Bosnia-Herzegovina, with an ethnically mixed 
population. 
  What is important to say here is that we presented this 
proposal of a three-level federal state as the grounds for 
another option that could be discussed during further 
negotiations, and that is to reorganize the state of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina into a federal state with four levels of 
authority. We have left this proposal open for the simple 
reason that we want to respect the positive results of the 
negotiating processes on Bosnia-Herzegovina so far. [sentence as 
heard] 
  [Bosnjak] As for the legitimacy of the Croatian assembly and 
the Croatian National Council, Bozidar Matic said the following: 
  [Matic] In times of war, assemblies such as this one cannot 
meet the strict requirements for legitimacy as set out in times 
of peace, when deputies are counted for a quorum, and so on. I 
know there will be questions as to how legal this Croatian 
National Council is and the way it was elected, and I would like 
to say one thing: Not one party that won power at the last 
elections had the partitioning of Bosnia-Herzegovina in its 
program. 
  Therefore, whoever and however elected -- if he works on the 
partitioning of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a country -- he has lost 
all legitimacy. 
  [Bosnjak] [passage omitted on the Croatian Academy of Arts 
and Sciences and its Bosnia-Herzegovina counterpart demanding 
end of war and respect of human rights] The correspondents did 
not have many questions, but they all referred to the proposal 
for the territorial organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The 
most important of the replies is the one that contained the hope 
and conviction that the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly will support 
at today's session the proposal of the assembly of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats, which would strengthen the 
negotiating positions in Geneva of those who support a united 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] A forced mobilization of Croats is being carried out 
in Zenica, the Croatian Defense Council's Zenica information 
service has reported. The Croats forcibly mobilized by the 
Muslim army are being sent to the front lines and forced to 
shoot at their dearest ones -- fathers, brothers, and sons. 
Recalcitrant Croats and those refusing to be mobilized are 
being arrested in large numbers. 
  The building housing the Croatian cultural center, which is 
a 
symbol of Croatian struggle, has been turned into a Muslim 
forces' military building. Before that it was a frequent target 
of Muslim fire. The Croatian population of Zenica is quietly 
resisting all forms of imposed Muslim authority.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Zdenko Vranjes] </F>
  [Text] Artillery and infantry fighting in the area of 
Kiseljak and Kresevo and in the vicinity of Novi Travnik 
intensified this morning. Infantry clashes were most intense 
around Kresevo where last night the HVO [Croatian Defense 
Council] repelled a powerful infantry attack by Muslim forces, 
inflicting huge losses on the attackers. 
  This morning Muslim artillery has pounded villages around 
Kiseljak. Civilians were wounded in the village of Lepenica but 
no exact casuality figures are yet available. 
  Novi Travnik and the surrounding villages, especially the 
village of Rastoci and Relej hill, again came under artillery 
and mortar attacks from the Muslim army. HVO military sources 
have said that in these attacks the Muslim army has been using 
shells filled with chlorine-based toxic gases. 
  At 0800 this morning a general alert was sounded in Mostar 
again. In mortar attacks by Muslims on the western part of 
Mostar [Croat-held] yesterday and throughout the night four 
civilians were wounded.

  [Text] Banja Luka, Feb 7 (TANJUG) -- Moslems from Tesanj, 
in the north of the former Yugoslav republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, publicly expressed their opposition to the 
policy of the Bosnian Moslem fundamentalist leader Alija 
Izetbegovic after a six-month silent resistance. 
  In a local radio programme monitored in the neighbouring 
Serb 
town of Banja Luka a proclamation was read accusing Izetbegovic 
of a policy of war with the creation of an Islamic state, a 
jamahiriya, in Bosnia-Herzegovina as its main objective. 
  "The policy carried out by Izetbegovic so far has brought us 
to the verge of a catastrophe ... we could have separated from 
each other and remained in peace with the Serbs and the Croats, 
but they started to stir us up, to teach us that we are of 
Moslem origin and that particularily the Serbs have been our 
century-old enemies", the proclamation reads. 
  Emphasizing that they wanted neither an autonomy nor a 
jamahiriya the Moslems from Tesanj called on their countrymen in 
Bosnia- Herzegovina to stand up against those who are for the 
continuation of bloodshed which will result in their eradication. 
  "Do not let them push us into a prolonged war against the 
Serbs", the proclamation states calling on the Islamic 
fundamentalists to leave the Tesanj area and to let the local 
Moslems continue to live in peace with or besides the Serbs and 
the Croats. 
  "We shall reach an agreement with the Serbs, let us not 
allow 
the fundamentalists to change our language and our culture", the 
Moslems from Tesanj said adding that they did not wish to 
prevent those who wanted to continue fighting for the "crazy 
ideas of a state founded on Islam". 
  The proclamation is the most direct confirmation of numerous 
indications in the last few months about the resistance of the 
local Moslems from Tesanj to Izetbegovic's policy. 
  There are also reports about agitations within the 110th 
Brigade of the Bosnian Croat Army (HVO), stationed in the Tesanj 
area, whose representatives contact units of the Bosnian Serbs 
more and more frequently with the aim of reaching a peace 
settlement. 
  These efforts have so far not yielded results because of the 
resistance of the Islamic fundamentalists dominating the Moslem 
units, loyal to Izetbegovic in the Tesanj area.

  [Text] Knin, 7 Feb (TANJUG) -- Croatian forces are still 
violating the cease-fire in the Benkovac area on the northern 
Dalmatian battlefront. 
  The main headquarters of the Serb Krajina army has reported 
that they opened fire on the area around the village of Biljani 
Gornji from recoilless guns and howitzers. Due to the intensity 
of fire, and because the soldiers, weapons and equipment of the 
Serb side were endangered, the Serb side was forced to respond. 
A statement says that while returning fire the Serb side 
destroyed one tank and one antiaircraft gun belonging to the 
aggressor. 
  The main headquarters of the Serb Krajina army warns that 
Croatia is using the cease-fire to regroup and bring in fresh 
forces and equipment to this section of the battlefield.

  [Text] Mate Granic, deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister of the Republic of Croatia, today sent a letter to the 
UN secretary-general's special envoy, Yasushi Akashi, sharply 
protesting against incidents that occurred on 5 February at the 
airports in Split and Sarajevo. 
  On that occasion some UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] 
low-ranking officials and officers refused to allow Zdravko 
Sancevic, Croatian ambassador to Bosnia-Herzegovina, and several 
other Croats to enter Sarajevo, thus preventing Ambassador 
Sancevic from carrying out his duties. It is inconceivable that 
an ambassador should not be allowed to enter the capital of the 
country to which he is accredited, regardless of whether he is 
stopped by the government of the host country or officials 
representing an international organization such as the United 
Nations, Granic said. He also expressed understanding for the 
problems faced by UNPROFOR in the implementation of their task 
and the hope that incidents like the ones of 5 February would 
not happen again. 
  In his letter to Akashi, Granic also expresses deep concern 
and personal regret over the tragedy at Sarajevo market, 
stressing that the Croatian Government sharply condemns such 
barbarian acts directed against innocent civilians. To prevent 
further escalation of chaos, violence, and suffering, the 
Croatian Government has called on all sides immediately to cease 
hostilities and return to the peace negotiations. The Croatian 
Government also calls on the international community to use all 
available means, including force, to stop tragic clashes in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is said among other things in Granic's 
letter to Yasushi Akashi.

relations between the two countries. Agreements on bilateral 
cooperation were also signed, the president's office has 
announced. 
  The two prime ministers, Janez Drnovsek and Nikica Valentic, 
informed President Tudjman about the agreements the two 
delegations signed during their talks. Both prime ministers 
agreed that their meeting today signified a major step in the 
further rapprochement between the two states and in building 
confidence and trade cooperation, in particular. The views of 
the two sides on a number of outstanding problems such as the 
border issue and Ljubljanska Banka [the Ljubljana Bank] 
converged even further today. These issues are expected to be 
resolved soon for the benefit of both sides. 
  At the end of the meeting President Tudjman and Prime 
Minister Drnovsek spoke about the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the possibilites for resolving the crisis 
in the area of former Yugoslavia. 
  The Slovene prime minister was accompanied by his Foreign 
Minister Lojze Peterle and Slovene Ambassador to Croatia Matija 
Valesic. In addition to Prime Minister Valentic, on the

  [Text] The prime ministers of the Republics of Croatia and 
Slovenia, Nikica Valentic and Janez Drnovsek respectively, 
signed in Zagreb six agreements on cooperation in various 
fields. Intensive talks over the past few weeks resulted in the 
regulation of future relations between the two countries in the 
sphere of education, culture, employement, and judiciary, 
cooperation in sea fishing, and economic and trade relations. 
  Ater the talks between the two prime ministers and their 
associates and after the agreements were signed in Banski Dvori 
in Zagreb, both prime ministers expressed satisfaction with the 
progress made in relations between the two countries. According 
to them, today's talks are the result of several months of hard 
work and meetings between experts and state officials. At the 
same time, the talks are an added impetus for solving the 
remaining problems. Both also said that there are no disputed 
issues or unsolvable problems beween the two countries. 
  The Croatian prime minister also said that it was 
understandable that both countries were interested in 
cooperation because we are encouraged to cooperate by tradition 
and other interests. Slovene Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek 
added that both countries would benefit from more intense 
cooperation, especially in the field of economy.

<F P=106> [Article by Srdjan Radulovic: "Martic Is Being Tested"] </F>
  [Text] After the election, the everyday life in Krajina is 
still characterized by consideration of the political outcome of 
the conflict between the two Milans -- Martic, the Krajina 
president, and Babic, the leader of the strongest party in 
parliament. If they do not reach a compromise, the Krajina 
political scene could turn into a merciless struggle between the 
two enemy camps. The continuation of the media campaign against 
Babic, also supported by television reporters and politicians 
from the Socialist Party of Serbia, points to this possibility. 
According to the method used so far, public opinion is being 
prepared for the message that Babic is to blame for a 
parliamentary crisis that could happen if his party does not 
support the personnel changes proposed by President Martic. 
  A coalition between Babic's Socialist Democratic Party (SDS) 
of Krajina with 30 seats in parliament, and the Radical Party 
with 16 is the only one that could possibly achieve the simple 
majority of 84 representatives. The creation of this coalition 
was announced before the election by both Babic and the Radical 
Party. After the second election round, Babic's supporters had 
the feeling, however, that the Radical Party did not keep it's 
promise to vote for Babic in the election, so that there is now 
suspicion about this coalition. Lazar Macura, a SDS Krajina 
representative, said in a statement for BORBA that he could not 
assess the behavior of the Radical Party members in the election 
in general, but that "it seemed to him that not everybody voted 
for Babic." 
<H5>  Who Will Be the Prime Minister? </H5>
  "Babic and Vojislav Seselj agreed on the coalition, and I do 
not believe that they will change their attitude, especially 
because the Radical Party wants to have one leadership, so that 
there will be no postion of party chairman for Krajina. On the 
other hand, it is also possible that some members of parliament 
might change to some other party, but this cannot lead to an 
imbalance of power," Macura says. 
  In his opinion, it is quite logical that Martic propose a 
new 
prime minister from the SDS Krajina. Asked what he thinks about 
opinions that this function could be offered to Djordje 
Bjegovic, the present prime minister, or to Borislav Mikelic, 
Macura answered that Krajina Socialist Party members cannot 
nominate the new prime minister since they only have 6 seats in 
parliament. He added that Mikelic should have better "run as a 
member of parliament to see what the people think of him." 
  President Martic avoided answering this question in the news 
conference held in Knin on Friday [28 January 1994], stating 
that "consultations with representatives of the parties are 
under way." He can count on the support of the Socialist Party 
and of the 15 SDS members of parliament who support the idea of 
united Serbian countries. As far as the eight independent 
members of parliament are concerned, some of them allegedly 
support Martic, and some Babic. Apart from that, even if he 
gets the votes of eight members from two small parties, he will 
not have the necessary majority in parliament. 
  Martic offering Babic the position of the prime minister and 
giving him the authority to form the new government in order to 
soothe passions has also been considered. It would be 
interesting if the man who was anathematized in the election 
campaign and almost declared an enemy of the nation became prime 
minister. It is very questionable, however, whether Babic would 
accept this offer. 
<H5>  Between Pale and Belgrade </H5>
  There are also similar considerations among the inhabitants 
of Knin. A quick opinion poll carried out in the streets of 
Knin proved that most of the people believe that "everything 
will hopefully be fine." Young people avoid making comments on 
the election. Some people alluded to worries over their 
personal safety if they made comments on the election. Martic's 
supporters speak the language recognizable from Sarajevo Radio 
and Television, whereas Babic's supporters cannot explain the 
turn in the election results. The attitude that "everything 
will hopefully be fine" is understandable in the present 
situation, which is difficult not only because of the exhausting 
three-year war, but also because of the present threats from 
Zagreb and because of political partitions in Krajina. Apart 
from that, there are -- for simple people -- inexplicable 
measures from Belgrade (the Geneva agreement between Tudjman and 
Milosevic) and Pale (the announcement that the Serbs who live in 
the areas up to the Una River will be united first; the regions 
up to the Kupa River will follow later). Mitar Vujnovic, a 
40-year-old man from the vicinity of Knin, says that "in the 
end, people always say what they want" and that "nothing can be 
decided without the people." Lazar Macura thinks, however, that 
political divisions have been imposed and sees the Geneva 
agreement as the "old Yugoslav syndrome" of making agreements 
"behind somebody's back," which harms Krajina. 
  Between the hope that "everything will hopefully be fine" 
and the suspicions, there remains the question of why Belgrade 
supported Martic. Both Babic and Martic supported the idea that 
all Serbian countries should unite and that the president of 
this newly established state should be Slobodan Milosevic. The 
only difference is that Martic would call this new state 
"Serbia, that is to say Yugoslavia," and Babic exclusively 
Serbia. Other election messages, which referred to defense, the 
economy, stamping out crime and so forth, remained at the level 
of the usual election phrases. Babic was presented in the 
campaign as the man who "only thinks of how to reach power" and 
who intends to "give Krajina back to Croatia," whereas Martic 
was given the aura of the unifier and of the most responsible 
man for the defense of Krajina (as if there was no Krajina Army). 
<H5>  Obstinate and Subordinate </H5>
  Experts on Krajina think that Martic's support from Belgrade 
resulted from Babic's obstinacy (in his relation to Milosevic) 
and from Martic's subordination to Milosevic's influence (it 
must not be forgotten that Martic is inclined to the Communist 
Party-Movement for Yugoslavia). These interpretations will soon 
be checked. It is indicative that Vladislav Jovanovic, the 
minister of foreign affairs of the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia, announced talks with his Hungarian colleague, Mr. 
Geza Jeszenszky. He also expressed the hope that the oil 
pipeline through Croatia would be opened soon, an issue that 
could be solved in talks between the representatives of Croatia 
and Krajina "after the agreement on an absolute cease-fire" is 
signed. 
  Does this mean that Minister Jovanovic already knows that 
such an agreement will be signed soon, in spite of the 
impediment that could not be removed so far -- that the Croatian 
forces withdraw from the occupied Krajina areas. Martic cited 
this problem in his first address. Croatia has not agreed to 
this condition so far, but, in spite of that, the joint 
declaration was signed in Geneva and it was announced that the 
oil pipeline and the highway between Zagreb and Belgrade, which 
both run through Krajina, would be reopened. 
  This means that Martic is already being tested. Should there 
be a crisis in connection with forming the government and with 
the work of parliament, he could make use of the constitutional 
power he has as president, especially in a state of war. Apart 
from the considerable influence he has on the police, Martic has 
additionally obtained the position of the supreme commander of 
the Krajina Army, where he has already announced "quality 
changes." 
<H5>  [Box, p 12] </H5>
<H5>  Conflict With Karadzic </H5>
  Lazar Macura claims that he has never said that Radovan 
Karadzic is a foreign citizen, stating that this allegation 
comes from Sarajevo Radio and Television, which misinterpreted 
his statement that "it is sad that Mr. Karadzic joined the 
election campaign in Banija [part of Krajina] walking in company 
of Mr. Mile Paspalj." Macura adds that Paspalj got the least 
votes in the election in Glina. He also denies the stories that 
the police of the Republic of Serbian Krajina took away his 
passport and threw him off the bus because of this statement, so 
that he had to wait for a train in order to return to Knin. 
<H5>  [Box, p 12] </H5>
<H5>  Unitary SDS </H5>
  The SDS leadership wants to neutralize the importance and 
the 
influence of the party through renewed attempts to create a 
unitary SDS before the Krajina Parliament is formed. The SDS 
Main Committee agreed in principal with the creation of a 
unitary SDS, on condition, however, that the election is 
completed and the new leadership in Krajina is constituted.

<F P=106> [Article by Ewa Kaszuba and Ewa K. Czaczkowska: "Day After </F>
Day Toward the Crisis"] 
  [Text] Conflicts within the governing coalition started 
even before the government was formed; with varied intensity, 
they persisted through the 100 days of governing. However, none 
of them shook the coalition as hard as the last one. 
<H5>  Overheard Near the Door </H5>
  As a consequence of the seriousness of the conflict and the 
gravity of the accusations leveled at one another by the 
politicians of both coalition parties, the last session of the 
Chief Council [RN] of the Social Democracy of the Polish 
Republic [SdRP] was held behind closed doors; journalists were 
not admitted. However, fragments of statements that could be 
made out in the corridor suggested that the participants were 
expressing severe criticism of the peasant [Polish Peasant Party 
(PSL)] partner. 
  Aleksander Kwasniewski admitted that the main shortcoming of 
the prime minister is the fact that he is not acting in line 
with the coalition agreements and that he is unable to 
communicate with the mass media. The cadre policy that the PSL 
is carrying out was termed by him as a "buddies" policy. As he 
later repeated officially, the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] 
has so far proposed eight candidates for the posts of voivodes 
and deputy voivodes; among them, only one person was a member of 
the party's leadership; the others were experts. The 22 
appointments that were made at the motion of the PSL concerned 
people chosen from among the PSL party apparatus. 
  Kwasniewski argued that the conflicts must not be left as 
they are, so both partners and the public will not be led to the 
conclusion that there is no problem at all; a similar situation 
might repeat itself in several weeks or more. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Marek Borowski said that economic 
policy entails a look into the future; it also requires a clear 
statement of what kind of policy the government wants to pursue. 
However, on this there are differences between the coalition 
parties. 
  According to Borowski, the PSL fulfills the role of a brake 
in the government by demanding the time to think things over. 
Now the problem is that there is no time because the atmosphere 
in the West is once again favorable to Poland, and new 
possibilities for obtaining foreign capital are opening up. One 
cannot be suspicious, the deputy prime minister said; one cannot 
review every single law every three months and correct 
provisions that are world standards. It is also intolerable 
that the coalition's deputies introduce and vote on amendments 
that distort bills submitted by the government. 
  Emphasizing that PSL policy is currently, to a considerable 
degree, catering to the needs of its own electorate, Borowski 
gave a few examples of decisions favoring the inhabitants of 
rural areas, such as great subsidies for the Agency for 
Agricultural Marketing [ARR], amendments to the Law on ARR, the 
Law on Compensatory Fees, and raises in old age pensions, which 
will primarily benefit farmers. Out of the 5 trillion zlotys 
[Z] earmarked for this year's raises, Z4 trillion will be 
received by them. 
  Even though he admitted that indeed the situation should not 
be aggravated, Borowski said that submitting conditions is 
different from offending a partner. He believes that the best 
solution would be if the PSL accepted the five conditions 
submitted by himself and the SLD, if it adopted the budget 
without tampering with its provisions; the peasants should also 
unblock the National Investment Funds so mass privatization 
could finally begin. Only then could the details be discussed. 
  The statements of both politicians were extensively 
commented 
on in the corridor. Some people in the corridor pointed out 
that the present conflict was brought on by excessive submission 
toward the PSL, which, they said, was the fault of Kwasniewski. 
  "If we let the peasants fill the post of the voivode in 
Wloclawek, it is clear that anything can be done to us," they 
said. 
  Members of the SdRP leadership did not conceal the fact 
that the proposal that all decisions be made by the government's 
Presidium was prompted by the need to watch the prime minister's 
hands. SLD politicians said the same during the coalition 
talks. The signing of agreements and appendixes was a 
consequence of the fact that, even in the previous Sejm, the PSL 
and its leader were well known for violating their agreements. 
The coalition also wants to keep a tighter rein on Michal 
Strak, head of the Office of the Council of Ministers [URM], by 
holding consultations concerning the filling of the positions of 
voivodes and deputy voivodes. As one politician conceded, the 
appetites of the URM head are enormous; however, one should 
rather not think about it in terms of one's own party or even in 
terms of the coalition but in much broader terms. 
<H5>  Conflicts, Disputes, and Understatements </H5>
  Frictions that posed serious threats to the coalitions began 
as early as the day that was supposed to end the talks on the 
final shape of the Pawlak Cabinet. When, after over a month of 
coalition talks, everyone, both politicians and journalists, 
sighed with relief that we already had a government, it turned 
out that it was too early. The list with the names of the 
ministers that the prime minister brought to the Belweder was 
contrary to the earlier agreements. The SLD politicians 
threatened to break the coalition; Pawlak had to yield. The 
"bone of contention" was the Finance Ministry, which, along with 
the portfolio of the deputy minister, was given to Marek 
Borowski, as well as the Ownership Transformations Ministry, 
which was taken over by Wieslaw Kaczmarek. These two politicians 
with "liberal" views on the economy were not welcomed by the 
PSL. The crisis ended when both sides signed an appendix to the 
coalition agreement. This appendix was not observed, which 
caused the latest conflict. 
<H5>  What Will Happen Next With the Coalition? </H5>
  Before the government was sworn in, the coalition was quite 
considerably rocked by the election of the chairman of the Sejm 
Foreign Affairs Committee. It is not known whether this 
conflict was caused by the disloyalty of coalition partners or 
by the fact that the agreement was not very clear. PSL leaders 
officially did not pay great attention to this, but the deputies 
began to express strong doubts about the intentions of the SLD; 
they started to ask: "What will happen next with the coalition?" 
  The same question was asked unofficially in the Sejm when 
the 
SLD Deputies' Club did not take part in discussions on the "New 
Year's" speech by the prime minister. The speech was not 
favorably received by the SLD; its deputies wondered why it had 
been delivered at all at that time. They argued that, among 
other things, the condition of the economy was depicted rather 
subjectively in the speech. 
  The coalition was also not really unanimous in the ballots 
on 
the acceptance of accounts of the Oszewski and the Suchocka 
governments. According to Kwasniewski, the discussion and the 
ballots were exclusively political, not substantive acts. 
<H5>  Assistant or Spokesman </H5>
  The government's information policy caused a serious 
misunderstanding as well. The appointment of Ewa Wachowicz to 
the post of press secretary did not bring about an enthusiastic 
response from the SLD, which wanted the prime minister to have a 
press spokesperson. Negative opinions of politicians and 
journalists on the information policy of the government forced 
the SdRP Presidium to forward a letter to the prime minister and 
ask that a concept of information policy be adopted. 

<H5>    Dispute Over Voivodes </H5>
  For a long time, it seemed that, if the issue of the filling 
of voivode posts might cause a split in the coalition, it would 
be not because of its appetites for the same voivodships but 
because of the attitude toward the need to replace voivodes in 
general. When, before the government was sworn in, Michal Strak 
spoke about the need to adjust the political map of voivodships 
to the election results, SLD politicians either tried to calm 
the situation or did not say anything. Finally, in early 
December, Kwasniewski admitted that the concept proposed by the 
PSL was very much to the SLD's liking. Despite the fact that 
both parties agreed that the post of the voivode in a given 
voivodship would be offered to the party that won the elections 
in that voivodship, conflicts were not avoided. A heated 
dispute arose when the Wloclawek voivode was being replaced. In 
the Wloclawek voivodship, the SLD won the elections (it gained 
five seats, the PSL only one); however, it was a PSL member who 
was appointed as voivode. He received definite support from the 
regional self-government sejm. This issue is said to have been 
discussed at the meeting of the "directorate"; Ryszard 
Jarzembowski, who is in charge of coordinating the replacement 
of voivodes on behalf of the SLD, was forced to say that URM 
should have an SLD representative--in the rank of an under 
secretary of state--who would also exert influence on decisions 
concerning voivodes. 
<H5>  Between the Coalition and the Belweder </H5>
  For quite a long time now, we have been witnessing a dispute 
over the posts of deputy ministers in the presidential 
ministries. As a result of the stance taken by the prime 
minister, who was afraid of a conflict with the Belweder, this 
controversy turned into a conflict between the Sejm National 
Defense Ministry, chaired by SdRP Secretary Jerzy Szmajdzinski, 
and the prime minister. Since December, the committee has been 
waiting for the prime minister to provide an answer to the 
question of merging posts by Jerzy Milewski. In the beginning, 
both PSL and SLD deputies demanded that the deputy ministerial 
posts in the presidential ministries be filled by their own 
people. When the prime minister did not really abandon this 
idea but definitely put off its implementation, the PSL stopped 
insisting on this. A few days ago, however, Leszek Bugaj (PSL) 
confirmed that the coalition would "not let it go at that," and, 
in a few weeks, it would have its own deputy minister in the 
National Defense Ministry. This demand emerged once again 
during the latest talks between Kwasniewski and Pawlak. 
<H5>  Principles of the Work of the Coalition </H5>
  1. In line with the coalition agreement, responsibility for 
the right work of the coalition lies with the chairmen of the 
coalition groupings and chairmen of the Deputies' Clubs of these 
groupings, who act jointly. 
  2. The drafts of strategic political, economic, and cadre 
decisions of the government are submitted to the chairmen of the 
Deputies' Clubs of the coalition groupings before final 
decisions on them are made. 
  3. Decisions concerning the members of the leadership of all 
of the ministries, appointed by the coalition groupings, are 
made by the prime minister after consultations with the relevant 
deputy ministers and the chairmen of the coalition groupings 
whose representative does not head the given ministry. 
  4. Decisions concerning personnel issues in the voivodship 
state administration are preceded by consultations with the 
chairmen of the Deputies' Clubs of the coalition groupings. 
<H5>  [Box, p 2 </H5>
<H5>  Principles of the Work of the Coalition </H5>
  The above-mentioned provisions were included in the appendix 
to the coalition agreement that was signed before the final 
composition of the Council of Ministers was forwarded to the 
Belweder.

  [Text] Should there be any breakup in the coalition, it 
will certainly not be over my part in the government but is far 
more likely to be over principles of cooperation, the 
application of which I had demanded in talks with the prime 
minister, and also perhaps over purely substantive matters, said 
Marek Borowski, deputy prime minister and finance minister, in 
an interview for the GLOS WIELKOLPOLSKI newspaper. 
  Borowski also insisted that, if the prime minister were not 
to accept his resignation, cooperation on the same conditions as 
had existed to date was impossible.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak </F>
by announcer Jaroslaw Gugala--live] 
  [Text] [Gugala] We welcome to the studio Mr. Waldemar 
Pawlak, chairman of the Council of Ministers. 
  [Pawlak] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. 
  [Gugala] Prime minister, you have said that decisions about 
the situation in the coalition will depend on what your PSL 
[Polish Peasant Party] colleagues would say. Has any decision 
like this been made? 
  [Pawlak] This concerns not only PSL decisions but also 
issues 
connected with the future course of the economic policy and 
future transformations in our country, and I think that today's 
OPZZ [National Trade Union Alliance] proceedings show that these 
disputes and divisions occur not so much between the parties 
that make up the coalition but, rather, along various lines 
within the very parliamentary groups that make up the coalition. 
And this does not concern aspects of procedural matters; it 
concerns fundamental matters. It is a question of how Poland is 
going to be reformed from now on. 
  [Gugala] How is Poland going to be reformed from now on? 
Will you accept the resignation of Mr. Marek Borowski, the 
deputy prime minister and finance minister? 
  [Pawlak] Yes. I think that this decision by Mr. Borowski was 
made with his full attention, his full consideration and 
reflection, and that it how it should be treated. 
  I think that, at the moment, this dispute concerns not so 
much procedural matters as an answer to the question of whether 
we are going to proceed in the direction of this straight 
forward liberal continuation, or, respecting the election 
results, we are going to fashion a prosocial policy, open to the 
needs of the economy and also the needs of the society. 
  And these are the questions asked by the people today 
because, when we meet the voters, we do not hear questions about 
procedure, about how the government proceeds. We hear questions 
about what solutions we are implementing, whether, for instance, 
we are changing policy principles, whether we are, for instance, 
going toward solutions that stimulate the economy or going 
toward solutions that shift benefits, social assistance, toward 
the poorest groups. This concerns, for instance, family 
benefits and housing benefits, and these are the kind of 
solutions that are needed now. 
  [Gugala] Prime minister, are you not afraid that this 
decision by you may bring about a very serious crisis inside the 
coalition, that it may make it so that it will be difficult to 
pursue any kind of policy whatsoever? 
  [Pawlak] I think the coalition is based on a jointly greed 
program, and here the decision of the SdRP [Social Democracy of 
the Polish Republic] Supreme Council also, first and foremost, 
points to the programmatic solutions, and I think this is what 
we are going to focus on. When we signed these coalition 
agreements, we were talking about the tasks facing us and the 
people's expectations and not about personalities, and that is 
how I want to continue to pursue this issue. 
  [Gugala] Is it possible to reconcile people's expectations 
with too short a blanket, which is what the state finances are? 
Marek Borowski, the deputy prime minister and finance minister, 
said that one could not conduct a policy separated from economic 
realities because it would not yield anything good for the 
people; on the contrary, it will cause greater inflation and 
trouble for the people. 
  [Pawlak] We are in agreement here. I think there is no 
controversy just here, but the question is whether we adopt a 
policy directed only toward simple fiscal mechanisms and simple 
mechanisms of distribution or take a direction toward searching 
for active forms regarding effects on the economy and active 
forms of receiving resources. Sometimes there were paradoxical 
situations, where the ministry responsible for revenues voiced 
doubts over ideas of different ministers aimed at revenue 
increases. 
  [Gugala] Are you of the opinion that the Finance Ministry 
failed in finding greater revenues? 
  [Pawlak] We are dealing here, first of all, with different 
approaches toward the creation of the budget. It cannot be a 
formula that we create a convenient budget, which could be 
implemented easily and which could be easily balanced, but that 
we create a budget that meets social expectations and focuses on 
areas of particular importance from the viewpoint of the future. 
Here one can give some thought to whether all resources were 
used properly. The Sejm commissions, for example, draw attention 
to the need for modifications in the budget. We will discuss 
that tomorrow, and I think that many proposals by the 
commissions can be taken into account as they point to some 
sources for redistribution within the budget, for better use of 
resources, and they point to income sources, which can 
contribute to directing them toward indispensable and useful 
goals. 
  [Gugala] Does it mean that your government will present a 
new 
draft budget? 
  [Pawlak] I do not think so. We are responsible for this 
government proposal, and I think that not one single person is a 
guarantor of the budget. Times have changed. There were times 
in the past when personalities or parties guaranteed this or 
that political order. Now the majority of the public clearly 
supports democracy and a free market, so these guarantees are 
not so obvious and necessary here. 
  This budget is a government proposal, and, as the 
government, 
we are going to put forward the solutions that are active and 
that have received approval from the Sejm commissions. 
  I think that tomorrow, at the government meeting, we will 
be able to talk about the modifications that were discussed in 
the Sejm. Some of them will be accepted. There is also a fairly 
large batch of proposals that simply have no chance of being 
implemented because they have no basis in the present economic 
realities. 
  [Gugala] Quite recently, Deputy Prime Minister Marek 
Borowski 
was one of our guests, and he said that the budget proposed by 
the government was already a very optimistic budget, that there 
were many areas there where the amounts assumed as state budget 
revenues were in fact wishful thinking. Are you not afraid that 
it will simply not be possible to get greater budget revenues? 
  [Pawlak] I think that, just as we said, both in the election 
campaign and in the early months of the government, we have to 
focus on actions that strive toward universal collection of 
revenues, collection of taxes, collection of duties, and much 
attention has to be devoted here to effective operation of these 
mechanisms. 
  We need to pay much attention to the areas on which the 
collection of taxes depends--that is, that the whole structure 
of the treasury offices, the customs offices, is well equipped 
so that the officials who decide about state revenues have 
realistic possibilities for receiving the income, and then, in 
the future, we can also think about reducing the tax rates once 
they are universally paid. 
  I think it is important to concentrate these modest 
resources 
on actions of this kind; then we will have no problems as to 
whether these views are well grounded, whether this budget is 
realistic or highly optimistic. This budget is based on 
realities, and, according to our appraisals and our opinions, it 
is possible to implement it. 
  [Gugala] But are you not afraid, Prime Minister, that 
tomorrow you will in fact receive no opportunity to talk about 
the budget because you will simply have to talk about Marek 
Borowski? 
  [Pawlak] I think we agreed to form the coalition to 
implement 
economic programs, to improve the economic situation in Poland, 
and for this policy to have a human face and be directed both 
toward people who are working in factories and enterprises and 
toward all those who are jobless at the moment, and not through 
allowances and benefits but through creating jobs. 
  The policy should also be directed toward those who worked 
honestly and well and now live on old-age and disability 
pensions. We have been going in this direction, and the first 
results regarding old-age and disability pensions are visible. 
  There is still a lot to be done in social and health 
insurance. A serious question is how to effectively overcome 
unemployment and create jobs. This is a question of large 
infrastructure programs--for example, the highway construction 
program, the promotion of export, and.... 
  [Gugala, interrupting] We could talk about this for a very 
long time. Prime Minister, do you assume that the coalition 
still exists, only without Mr. Marek Borowski? 
  [Pawlak] It is my conviction that the coalition still 
exists. 
While making decisions, every one of us should carefully 
consider the consequences of these decisions, and I think we 
have opportunities and possibilities to work for Poland in 
different places. I think that the effects of our work are of 
the utmost importance. If we are going to act like that, where 
we do it is secondary. 
  [Gugala] When are you going to meet Mr. Aleksander 
Kwasniewski? 
  [Pawlak] We have arranged to hold a coalition meeting 
tomorrow [8 February], and I think we will discuss issues there, 
what has to be done and how, and not procedural matters. 
  [Gugala] Thank you for visiting our studio.

<F P=106> [Interview with Polish Deputy Prime Minister Aleksander </F>
Luczak, deputy chairman of the Polish Peasant Party Chief 
Council, by Ewa K. Czaczkowska and Kazimierz Groblewski; place 
and date not given: "How Did It Happen? One Cannot Negate 
Everything"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Luczak] The Democratic 
Union, which is beyond a doubt the strongest party derived from 
Solidarity roots, keeps suffering defeats. The Solidarity camp 
failed to establish a party that would be a driving force for 
the transformations. Practically speaking, it is hard to tell 
what the social basis of Solidarity is now supposed to be. You 
keep asking: "How did you manage to score the [election] 
success?" I think the answer lies in the clarity of the social 
groups that both parties addressed: The Democratic Left 
Alliance [SLD] addressed urban residents, mainly laborers, 
whereas we addressed residents of rural areas, mainly farmers. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] But Solidarity parties also addressed the 
same social group. 
  [Luczak] But Solidarity units kind of went against all that, 
and, in this way, they wasted their victory of 1989. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Don't think that what happened on 19 
September was simply a matter of society displaying an opposite 
reaction? 
  [Luczak] It is possible. We [the Polish Peasant Party 
(PSL)] and they [the SLD] are both at the stage of adapting 
ourselves to democracy. Before the elections, society supported 
the previous system very vigorously, but now, after four years 
have passed, society made a decision that now is the time for 
us. Those who are in power are always more vulnerable to 
criticism. 
  But I would oppose it when someone says that our parties are 
postcommunist. Genealogy is what it is; everyone was born at 
some point. Take a look at the origins of some Solidarity 
activists. [passage omitted] 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] But isn't it so that the main reason for 
the PSL's success [in the 19 September 1993 elections] was that 
the party guaranteed to maintain the status quo in rural areas 
and the areas' structure, that the PSL gave hope that nothing 
would change and that what was going on for four years will be 
slowed down, if not completely withdrawn? 
  [Luczak] My view is that, as is the case with many other 
areas, agricultural changes must be evolutionary. Any type of 
action aimed at gaining a fast result is doomed to failure. 
Throughout the 1970's and the 1980's, the authorities were 
afraid of farmers. They were afraid to interfere with farmers' 
property so they maintained the status quo. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] So you [PSL activists] decided to echo the 
authorities by saying: Let the rural areas remain the way they 
are. 
  [Luczak] Belarusians or Ukrainians would give a lot in 
return for being able to have the kind of rural areas we have. 
We, on the other hand, have them but are not happy anyway. 
Unless appropriate means are directed to rural areas, nothing 
will come of policies written down on paper. Even if those 
means are indeed directed there, I am terribly skeptical as far 
as agricultural reforms are concerned. I can see that the 
civilized world is helpless when faced with agricultural 
problems. 
  [Excerpts] [RZECZPOSPOLITA] So, in your view, problems in 
rural areas are unsolvable? 
  [Luczak] They can be solved, but that is very hard to do 
because, with current technologies, one can lead to the kind of 
growth of agricultural output that is almost without limits. 
That, of course, causes rules of employment to change. There is 
also a clash with routine ways of behavior, with attachment to 
land, and with tradition. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] You promised before the [19 September] 
elections that you would find such appropriate financial means 
for rural areas, as well as subsidies and inexpensive credits. 
But now it turns out that there is not enough money in the 
budget; even your own Sejm deputies club is critical of that. 
  [Luczak] There is more money in the budget than was the case 
last year, but there is still not enough for everyone. Those 
who think that one can achieve progress in that area in a very 
short time are wrong. The purpose of our election program was 
to convince people, and my view is that it was done well. But 
another issue is that the program's implementation must be 
spread out over time. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Is it your view that the fall in popularity 
rating for the United Peasant Party-PSL in the period preceding 
the 1989 and 1991 elections was just temporary, or is it perhaps 
the case that the PSL's current success is just temporary? What 
is permanent? 
  [Luczak] Nothing in this world is permanent. We are all 
just a passing phase.... Not to waste the great victory--that 
is what wise behavior should be about, in this situation. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] All right, but we will have 
self-governmental elections shortly. 
  [Luczak] Let it all boil there, in that melting pot. Then 
it will turn out that some people are destined to be in office 
two years, whereas other people four years. We have a democracy 
now, and there is nothing permanent in a democracy. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] So you can imagine the PSL not being 
permanent? 
  [Luczak] As a peasant movement, we have a hundred years 
behind us, and I would not like to live long enough to see the 
movement's end. I will always keep saying that the peasant 
movement has achieved the most now, when you take a look at its 
entire history. I think it is likely that, in the future, we may 
be in the opposition, that we will be a party without successes. 
But that possibility is a feature of democracy. The peasant 
movement may go through a worse period of its history, but the 
most important thing is that it be on the list of those parties 
that will be permanently participating in the country's 
political life over the next two decades. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Can you imagine a situation where a 
completely different party would gain the votes of your 
electorate, whereas you would disappear from the scene and 
become a very small, a miniature kind of party? 
  [Luczak] It is possible theoretically, but I think we have 
enough common sense in what we do to not let that happen. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] You are a class party, the last of your 
kind. Will such parties continue to exist much longer? 
  [Luczak] There is a whole debate going on about whether we 
are a class party or an all-nation one. An all-nation party was 
being built beginning in the early 1940's, from the days of 
Mikolajczyk. But the fact that it is so hard for us to detach 
ourselves from the class nature is a consequence of tradition 
and of various interdependencies linked to it. We are a young 
society, genealogically speaking. The first generations made up 
of laborers and intelligentsia are always very negatively 
predisposed toward their rural origins. We gained big support 
in rural areas; that group of people was convinced by what we 
told them. But I think that, in terms of a party program, we 
are not a class party but one whose program is for all social 
groups. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Will the PSL "guarantee everyone 
profitability of agricultural production through the selling of 
their products?" You know where that quote is from--your 
campaign leaflet. 
  [Luczak] There is nothing you can guarantee forever in a 
market economy. Every artificial creation will prove impossible 
to implement after some time passes. But it would also be a bad 
thing if one were to discontinue measures aimed at guaranteeing 
the profitability of production. Everyone wants to receive the 
kind of payment for his work that would compensate for the labor 
he invested. If you have a peasant investing more in his 
production than what he receives after selling the product (I am 
ignoring here his own labor for the moment), that is morally 
repugnant and economically unacceptable, and, in that case, 
perhaps one should guarantee the profitability of agricultural 
production through administrative measures. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] That would be a complete return to the old 
ways. 
  [Luczak] No one will do it generally and as a wide-sweeping 
measure. But to promote agricultural production and to preserve 
certain types of crops, one must create the right conditions to 
make profitability clearly visible. But we will not go back to 
quotas or uniform prices throughout the country. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Does a politician feel ashamed at any time? 
I mean the kind of shame when he promises something during an 
election campaign but later, when his party is in power and he 
has the means to implement it, he fails to do what he promised. 
I am saying that because you sound as if you assumed from the 
very beginning that what you had talked about will not be 
implemented. 
  [Luczak] You cannot approach politics in a way that is 
detached from reality, nor can you, I would say, approach 
politics in moral terms only. Politics has its own rules. One 
knows from the very beginning that nothing contained in an 
election program can be implemented right away. Such is the 
case the world over. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Are you saying one should not believe 
politicians? 
  [Luczak] Politics is an art of talking to society. There 
definitely should be a certain margin of confidence, but not 
"from wall to wall." There must be a certain margin, there must 
be something that binds society together, something that will 
make it... 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] ...Decide that the thing is lost? 
  [Luczak] Well, yes. Such are the rules of the game. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Your government implements to a large 
extent the program of the previous cabinets. 
  [Luczak] It is a very good thing that there are no major 
turning points; society would not stand for that. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] But, in that case, don't you think there is 
room on the political scene for the kind of PSL the people think 
it is or for the kind they voted for? While in power now, the 
PSL is doing something different from what it promised. 
  [Luczak] How many times did we have radicals, socialists, or 
Christian-democratic activists in power--I am talking about 
other countries now--and then it seemed it was the end, but they 
gained power again. There is something in nations, in society, 
something... 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] ...Irrational? 
  [Luczak] No, I mean more like expecting a change. Once the 
new governing team brings disappointment, nostalgia for the past 
is born. It was better in the old days.... 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] ...And we were younger then? 
  [Luczak] Exactly. So people say: Let us go back to that 
now; let us not vote for those who are in power now. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] So that means party programs have nothing 
to do with choices, but, instead, there are simply some stages? 
A party leaves and another comes along. So, in your view, 
party programs are completely meaningless? 
  [Luczak] You keep trying to make me say that election 
promises are just black and white. That is not true. In my 
view, when something is black only or white only, that is a very 
bad thing because it gives rise to extremes--for instance, 
communism or fascism. Poland has entered the kind of phase 
where parliamentary coalitions will be establishing cabinets, 
and, after gaining power, these coalitions will mark their 
identity on the political scene not by making something black 
and white but by approaching social needs and privatization 
needs in a different manner. And once social moods take a swing 
in the other direction, there will be different priorities 
visible. Politics cannot be black and white. Countries that 
want to be stable and play even a small role must counteract 
extremes to enable them to keep moving down the same road but in 
a slightly different groove. We may see that happen in Poland. 
  When it comes to election campaigns, they are based on their 
own rules. During an election campaign, you must present 
programs, you must speak through slogans because you are talking 
to people who often see a politician for the first time. These 
people would be bored if you tried to detail the program item by 
item. So you must use simple words like "here," "now," "we," 
"nobody again," "never." But the people must understand that, if 
a particular coalition is back in power, particular issues will 
be focused on more. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] What role did the church play in the PSL's 
success in the most recent elections? Do you think the church 
has reached the stage of regarding the PSL as "its own" party? 
  [Luczak] The church did not involve itself unequivocally on 
either our side or anyone else's. I would regard it as a sign 
that the church refuses to involve itself politically. The 
church's neutral position during the election campaign--not 
telling people who to vote for--objectively helped us. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] I am wondering whether the ability to 
create the view among people that the PSL is both a left-wing 
party and a Catholic one is not a prescription for your next 
success. 
  [Luczak] That is a special trait displayed by parties active 
in rural areas. We are a party that, from the very beginning of 
its activity, has always wanted to have good rapport with the 
church, in terms of both religion and the philosophy of life. 
But, beginning with Witos, the PSL did not want to have the 
church as its patron. Peasants wanted to decide on their own 
which direction their policies should take. True, there were 
cases of priests who wanted to be in command of the peasant 
movement, but these measures ended in failure. Generally 
speaking, the peasant movement was with God, but it refused to 
act with the church as its patron. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] A politician said that we will have a 
PSL-Belvedere coalition in power by year's end. 
  [Luczak] No, no. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] We will probably know the names of 
presidential candidates at the end of the year. Will that be a 
cause for disagreement with the SLD. In other words, will you 
come up with your own candidate? 
  [Luczak] I cannot imagine the PSL running in the 
presidential elections in the coalition. The PSL will come up 
with its own candidate. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Who will that be? 
  [Luczak] [No response published] 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Will your candidate compete with the SLD's? 
  [Luczak] The governing coalition is one thing, but 
presidential elections are quite another. Despite the 
complexity of the issue, presidential campaigns are always very 
personalized. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] The previous presidential elections 
extracted a heavy toll on the Solidarity camp. Will these 
coming ones have a destructive effect on the coalition? 
  [Luczak] At that time, the starting point was different--the 
Solidarity camp constituted a whole that all of a sudden cracked 
during the election campaign. Despite the coalition nature of 
our government, I think we do not constitute a whole, either in 
terms of ideology or party programs. The governing coalition was 
set up for a defined period of time, with the goal of 
implementing the tasks defined in the coalition agreement. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Don't you dream of a demonstration on Aleje 
Ujazdowskie under the banner "Out with Luczak, out with [Prime 
Minister] Pawlak, out with the PSL and [chief of the Office of 
the Council of Ministers] Strak"? 
  [Luczak] I have a view on this that boils down to this: 
When you dream of something, it will not come true. So may I 
have only such dreams and not other kinds.

  [Text] The national protest committee for the defense of 
Polish agriculture has asked the highest authorities of Poland 
to start talks urgently. Andrzej Lepper, the leader of the 
Samoobrona [militant farmers organization], suggested a state 
farm at Montowo in Torun Province as the venue for talks. 
  The committee demands, among other things, the increase of 
funds for agriculture by 8 trillion zlotys by raising the budget 
deficit, and that priority be given to workers' companies in 
leasing former state farms. It also demands cheap credits for 
the purchase of turnover assets and for running production, and 
that those guilty of destroying Polish agriculture be called to 
account.

  [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak 
Republic today issued a statement on the criminal attack on the 
Sarajevo market. In its statement, the ministry strongly 
denounces such deliberate attacks, whichever of the fighting 
sides is their originator. 
  At the same time, the Foreign Ministry appeals to the UN 
secretary general and the UN Security Council to adopt more 
radical measures to speed up the solution to the situation on 
the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is becoming 
unbearable both politically and from the humanitarian point of 
view. 
  The Slovak Republic will continue to assist in the search 
for 
a peaceful solution to the war conflict on the entire territory 
of the former Yugoslavia in accordance with the extent of its 
possibilities, says the statement issued by the Foreign Ministry.

  [Text] During coalition talks in Bratislava today, Vladimir 
Meciar, the prime minister and chairman of the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia, called on Ludovit Cernak, the chairman of 
the Slovak National Party [SNS], to resign from the post of 
deputy chairman of the National Council. He justified this by 
saying that Mr. Cernak had refused to give guarantees that he 
would coordinate the parliament's session on 16 February in a 
way that would ensure a joint action by all coalition members. 
  Speaking at a news briefing, the prime minister went on to 
say that representatives of the opposition held talks on methods 
of turning the discussion on the big privatization bill into an 
immediate political solution and noted that they would express a 
lack of confidence in Parliament Chairman Ivan Gasparovic. This 
failed to happen only because the Party of the Democratic Left 
rejected it, Vladimir Meciar added. 
  SNS Honorable Chairman Jozef Prokes confirmed the prime 
minister's statement that they proposed an open coalition 
[otvorena koalicia] to the Party of the Democratic Left [PDL]. 
He said the response of PDL representatives was slightly 
negative but not altogether dismissive.

<F P=106> [First installment of Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik's </F>
report to parliament on 2 February: "Slovakia in the World"] 
  [Text] For the first time ever, a report on the 
independent Slovak Republic's foreign policy has been delivered 
in the National Council of the Slovak Republic. We consider 
this document to be historic and have therefore decided to 
publish the full text of it. It was by Foreign Minister Jozef 
Moravcik. 
<H3>  Evaluation of the Fulfillment of Slovak Foreign Policy in 
1993 </H3>
  In 1993, the Slovak Republic established itself as an entity 
under international law. In the first year of its independent 
existence, the Slovak Republic has successfully become party to 
all of the important international organizations and agreements, 
as permitted by the conditions and the situation that arose 
after the partition of Czechoslovakia. In the course of the 
year, we have succeeded in defining the interests and priorities 
of the Slovak Republic's foreign policy and in gradually 
presenting ourselves as an equal-right partner on the 
international scene. These facts create favorable prerequisites 
for the Slovak Republic's foreign policy in 1994. 
<H5>  1. The Sphere of Multilateral Cooperation </H5>
<H5>  1.1 Slovak Foreign Policy in the Security Sphere </H5>
  The unequivocal definition of the Slovak Republic's 
orientation on security matters and drafting a concept in that 
sphere has been one of the most important results of the Slovak 
Republic's foreign policy in 1993. 
  The Slovak Republic is not able to secure its security 
through its own forces. This is why Slovakia began to seek 
security guarantees at the very beginning of its establishment. 
Slovakia unequivocally sees the guarantee for its own security 
in West European security structures, and it seeks the optimal 
ways of integrating itself into them. 
  In the European security system that is being established, 
there are several entities of different importance and weight. 
NATO is the most efficient security organization in Europe. 
The process of the Slovak Republic's rapprochement with NATO is 
a long-term process involving many aspects. This process fits 
harmoniously into the process of establishing a new European 
security system. 
  The basic steps and measures that are inevitable for the 
Slovak Republic's integration into the North Atlantic Alliance 
(NAA) are detailed in the Project of the Slovak Republic's 
Rapprochement with NATO. A commission comprising members of the 
Foreign Ministry, Defense Ministry, and Finance Ministry 
participated in drafting this project. 
<H5>  NATO and the Western European Union [WEU] </H5>
  The Slovak Republic regards extending its activities in the 
North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC) and participating in 
the NATO program for Central and East Europe as the most 
important element of its rapprochement with NATO. Slovakia's 
efficient engagement in NACC activities have resulted in its 
participation in the work of the Political Committee, the 
Economic Committee, and an ad hoc peacekeeping group. The 
Slovak Republic's charge d'affaires in Brussels has regularly 
participated in NACC meetings at an ambassadorial level. At the 
end of 1993, Slovakia intensified its contacts with NATO, 
particularly with the aim of influencing the final shape of the 
Partnership for Peace plan. 
  In 1993, the parliamentary aspect of cooperation with NATO 
intensified. The Slovak Republic, as an observer, began 
regularly and actively to participate in North Atlantic Alliance 
meetings. 
  The intensification of the contacts on all of the levels 
represents yet more evidence of improving cooperation between 
NATO and the Slovak Republic. In the course of 1993, Slovak 
Republic representatives at the highest level visited NATO. The 
president's and the prime minister's visit to NATO has finally 
dispersed worries about our security orientation and its nature. 
NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner received the Slovak 
deputy prime minister and the foreign minister on the occasion 
of the European Community Three meeting with the Visegrad Four 
countries. 
  The contacts of the Slovak Republic's representatives within 
the NACC are also universal. Between 8 and 29 March 1993, there 
was an NACC meeting at the level of defense ministers. The 
participants in the meeting gave their opinions on NACC 
activities since the previous meeting of defense ministers; 
discussed defense-related problems linked to peacekeeping 
operations, which were conducted on the basis of a document 
drafted by the NACC ad hoc group; and gave their opinions on the 
possibility of further cooperation in the sphere of security. 
On 11 June 1993, there was an NACC meeting on the level of 
defense ministers in Athens. On 17 July 1993, A. de Francis, 
NATO first deputy secretary general, received the Slovak foreign 
minister during his visit to Brussels. On 3 December 1993, 
there was an NACC meeting on the level of defense ministers in 
Brussels. 
  Several high NATO officials visited the Slovak Republic in 
1993. J. Shalikashvili, supreme commander of NATO troops in 
Europe, visited Slovakia. In Bratislava, a staff meeting 
between the Slovak Defense Ministry and a NATO SHAPE delegation 
took place with the aim of evaluating the level of mutual 
cooperation and finding ways to improve it. On this basis, the 
plan for cooperation between the Slovak Defense Ministry and 
NATO SHAPE has been drafted for 1994. From the viewpoint of 
searching for the optimal forms of cooperation, the visit to 
Slovakia by Dr. E.v.C. Bruce, NATO director of press and 
information, was an important event. 
  In the fall of 1993, W. van Eekelen, the WEU general 
secretary, visited the Slovak Republic and met with the 
president, the prime minister, and the foreign minister. 
  The visit of the NAA secretary general to the Slovak 
Republic 
on 15 November 1993 helped to develop relations between the NAA 
and the National Council of the Slovak Republic. 
  The Slovak Republic, however, still does not have 
specialized diplomatic representation in NATO in Brussels. The 
task of securing cooperation with NATO and the WEU has been 
fulfilled by our mission in Brussels and the Slovak Permanent 
Mission at the WEU. 
<H5>  CSCE </H5>
  The Slovak Republic's course of action during the CSCE 
meetings in Vienna in 1993 was based on Resolution 980, approved 
by the Slovak Republic Government on 22 December 1992. The 
activity and contacts with the U.S. Department of Defense, the 
Defense Ministries of Sweden and Italy, and the CSCE general 
secretary have helped to efficiently establish the Slovak 
Republic within the CSCE. The Slovak Republic's Permanent 
Mission in Vienna has considerably contributed to this 
establishment. 
  One of the first tasks of Slovak diplomacy within the CSCE 
was to dispel worries about the status of the Hungarian ethnic 
minority living in Slovakia. The partition of the former 
Czechoslovakia has been used to dramatize the situation. The 
mission that visited Slovakia as a new CSCE country in March 
1993 confirmed that the Slovak Republic had fulfilled the 
obligations it had toward the CSCE and ethnic minorities. The 
mission also stated that the transition toward a market economy 
and pluralist democracy and respect for human rights were 
satisfactory in the Slovak Republic. These processes have not 
been discontinued since the partition of Czechoslovakia. The 
mission's conclusions have also contributed to lower tension 
surrounding the ethnic minorities issue. According to the 
mission, there are opportunities for improving the legal status 
of the minorities in Slovakia, but, in general, the mission has 
not discovered any signs of tensions or hostility between 
various ethnic groups. 
  The mission of the CSCE High Commissioner for Human Rights 
has similar results. In the interests of reducing tension in 
that sphere, making the situation clear, and building mutual 
trust, the Slovak side proposed, on the initiative of the Slovak 
prime minister, the establishment of an impartial group of CSCE 
experts to examine the status of the Hungarian ethnic minority 
in the Slovak Republic and the status of the Slovak ethnic 
minority in Hungary, and the overall ethnic policies of the two 
countries. 
  We consider the acceptance of our proposal to establish a 
group of experts from other countries as a success for Slovak 
diplomacy. This was something new in the CSCE's attitude toward 
solving problems related to the status of ethnic minorities and 
in the CSCE concept of preventive diplomacy. For the first 
time, the CSCE is taking preventive steps in a situation where 
there is no open conflict or center of tension. 
  Our membership in the coordinating CSCE Three and our 
participation in important activities, mainly in the sphere of 
preventive diplomacy, have helped the Slovak Republic to 
establish itself within the CSCE. Our activity in the Three, 
consultations on the higher ministerial level, participation in 
CSCE missions and in the decisionmaking process, plus our 
fulfillment of all of our obligations, helped the Slovak 
Republic to obtain its proper position. 
  We can mention several of the most important activities in 
which the Slovak Republic participated as a member of the Three: 
the meeting between the Three and U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher, consultations with the top officials of the Council 
of Europe and the United Nations about problems of human 
dimensions, the meeting with ZRJ [expansion unknown] officials 
in Stockholm on extending the CSCE mandate in former Yugoslavia, 
and the ministerial meeting of the CSCE Council on further 
improving CSCE activity. Moreover, Slovak diplomats participated 
in Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas's mission in 
Central Asian and Transcaucasian countries on the level of high 
commissioners, and in the intelligence mission in Macedonia 
commissioned in connection with Macedonia's admission to the 
CSCE. 
  At meetings of the CSCE Forum for Security Cooperation, the 
goal of which was to strengthen cooperation between CSCE member 
countries on security and to reduce the risk of new conflicts in 
the region, the Slovak Republic has built on the activity of the 
former CSFR and has become a coauthor of the proposal to draft 
new measures to strengthen trust and security and to harmonize 
the obligations adopted on military security in the previous 
period, and a coauthor of the joint proposal by 24 countries on 
the nonproliferation of arms and the control of their transfer. 
The Slovak foreign minister spoke at a plenary meeting of the 
CSCE Forum for Security Cooperation in Vienna on 29 September 
1993. 
  One of the most important roles of the Slovak delegation at 
the Vienna meetings dealing with the Conventional Forces in 
Europe Treaty [CFE] and the Open Skies Treaty was to ensure the 
Slovak Republic's successorship as regards both treaties. The 
countries that signed the CFE Treaty approved at an 
extraordinary conference on 5 February 1993 the division of the 
former CSFR's obligations between the two successor countries. 
The Slovak Republic's successorship in the Open Skies Treaty, 
which creates conditions for building the trust by observing the 
military activities of the CSCE countries, was confirmed on the 
plenary meeting of the signatories on 3 May 1993. 
  The Slovak Republic has also participated in the meeting of 
the Consultative Committee of the CSCE Center for Preventing 
Conflicts, whose importance, however, has significantly declined 
with the progress of CSCE institutionalization. The task of the 
Forum for Consultations on Security Issues was transferred onto 
the newly established Vienna Group of CSCE Committee of High 
Commissioners.

  [Excerpts] Representatives of the Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia [HZDS] and the Slovak National Party [SNS] held 
coalition talks in the Slovak Parliament today. Answering 
journalists' questions regarding what happened at the roundtable 
meeting, [SNS Chairman] Ludovit Cernak said, and I quote, you 
will be informed by the well-tested pair [Meciar-Prokes]. 
Afterward, journalists were addressed at a short news briefing 
by [HZDS Chairman] Vladimir Meciar and Jozef Prokes [SNP 
honorary chairman and deputy speaker of Slovak parliament]. 
  [Begin Meciar recording] The main issue we addressed was 
whether Mr. Cernak, as SNS chairman, still feels personally 
committed to the coalition agreement between the HZDS and SNS. 
The other issue was whether he was willing to coordinate 
actions at the [parliament's] plenary session on 16 February so 
as to ensure our [SNS and HZDS coalition] joint behavior and 
actions. He answered that the only thing he was willing to 
follow was purely his conscience. 
  I personally urged him to step down from the post of deputy 
chairman of the National Council of the Slovak Republic because 
the only reason for his holding this post is that, as a 
coalition, we agreed to render political support to him. In 
this situation, the HZDS is unable to support Mr. Cernak's 
remaining in the post of deputy chairman of the National 
Council. He replied that [word indistinct] if we think we have 
enough votes to recall him, we should go for it. 
  We also asked whether it [Cernak's faction in the SNS] was 
ready to respect the unity of the deputies' club, thus 
specifying our willingness to talk only to those representatives 
delegated by the SNS. We received a negative answer. 
  Given these circumstances, the HZDS will continue to ensure 
that agreed coalition undertakings are fulfilled. It pledges to 
support the SNS as [?a whole]. We are interested in the SNS 
being a strong partner. We will be coordinating our actions in 
the National Council with all those who want to coordinate their 
actions with us. [end recording] [passage omitted] 
  [Begin Prokes recording] It is questionable at the present 
time whether Mr. Cernak, as deputy chairman of the National 
Council, represents the SNS because the SNS Central Council 
clearly voiced a lack of confidence in him. That is one aspect 
of the matter. 
  The other aspect is that all of the deputies, including 
those 
siding with Mr. Cernak, were asked to take part in joint talks 
with the HZDS and the SNS [deputies'] club. None of them took 
part in these talks, however. Thus, the issue of whether this 
group actually intends to respect coalition agreements was the 
correct issue to raise. I think that the SNS assembly scheduled 
for 19 February will unequivocally resolve this question. After 
all, SNS district conferences have indicated a certain solution 
to this issue. But, in any case, I think that once there is a 
partnership, problems should be discussed internally rather than 
passing them to the mass media. [end recording]

  [Text] Zagreb, 7 Feb (TANJUG) -- Referring to the threats 
of sanctions against Croatia, FRY [Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia] Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic told the 
Zagreb-based weekly DANAS that the FRY is against sanctions 
because they aggravate problems rather than resolve them. 
  The best example of this is Yugoslavia where the sanctions 
are expected "to bring peace to Bosnia but instead they have 
served to foment the war even further." 
  At the same time they have brought about destabilization not 
just in Yugoslavia but further afield and have "become the 
largest obstacle to peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina," Jovanovic 
warned. 
  Minister Jovanovic described the recent declaration between 
Croatia and the FRY as a major step forward and as an obligation 
for both sides to use political means and a peaceful way, rather 
than force, in resolving future problems. 
  According to Jovanovic, the declaration reflects the 
determination on both sides to embark upon efforts to normalize 
relations. A joint statement from Geneva provides for an 
agreement to open representative offices "and not to establish 
diplomatic relations or to recognize each other." The 
declaration is only a step in that direction, Jovanovic 
explained. 
  Asked to comment on the views that since the joint 
declaration was based on CSCE documents and the UN Charter it 
indirectly implied recognition of the Republic of Croatia by the 
FRY, Jovanovic said that "one should not look for something that 
is not in the agreement." 
  He added that this agreement "prejudges none of the 
outstanding issues including Krajina, the division of assets, 
mutual recognition or even full diplomatic relations." When 
conditions are ripe these issues will be settled, the federal 
foreign minister stressed. 
  We must bear in mind that the issue of Krajina is part of 
the 
Vance plan which stipulates that its political future and status 
must be resolved through direct negotiations between legitimate 
representatives of Krajina and the Republic of Croatia. Our 
agreement in Geneva is conducive to negotiations on these 
issues. The fact is that we have opened a process likely to 
increase the chances for exchanging political visits and 
establishing political contacts directly without mediators. 
This is a natural course to be pursued by two countries that 
want to settle their bilateral relations without "foreign 
middlemen." 
  The coming visit by FRY Federal Deputy Prime Minister Zeljko 
Simic to Zagreb is a step in this direction. This visit will 
most likely be followed by a visit to Belgrade by the Croatian 
deputy prime minister and foreign minister [Mate Granic]. 
Contacts of a different kind at an even higher level are also a 
possibility, Jovanovic said.

<F P=106> [Interview with FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic by </F>
Dragan Colovic; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Jovanovic] In whose interest could it possibly be 
to commit such a horrendous crime, and what can somebody who 
might be interested in such a crime expect from it? In this 
respect, we must clearly see that the Serbian side is definitely 
not the one that harbors any interest in prolonging the crisis 
and even less in complicating and deteriorating it further by 
producing such horrendous pictures of war. The perpetrators 
should be sought among those who have been, even so far, staunch 
opponents of the peace process or the factors that on several 
occasions did everything they could to postpone, prolong, or 
thwart this process. 
  In any case, the investigation, which we expect to be 
meticulous and objective, should establish not merely the 
physical executor, but also the side that was behind the 
executor, that appears as the chief obstruction to the progress 
toward peace. Understandably, all this could have been avoided 
and we would not have needed to watch all these pictures of war 
-- neither the less bloody ones nor these most horrific ones -- 
had the peace that was so readily on offer for acceptance in 
Geneva been accepted wholeheartedly by those who care about 
peace. 
  [Colovic] Mr. Minister, can this event influence, and to 
what extent, the ways of the further resolution of the crisis in 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina and also on the territories of former 
Yugoslavia? 
  [Jovanovic] You see, with its drama and dimensions, this 
horrendous crime can be misused by the opponents of peace to 
further endanger the peace process and justify the policy of 
force, that is to say, the war option as the only way out of 
this situation. 
  On the other hand this terrible accident can act as a last 
warning to all who have maintained a reasonable approach toward 
the Bosnian crisis, namely, that the postponement of peace is no 
longer counterproductive, but also criminal, and that we must 
concentrate on the peace process and bring it to an end in one 
or two swipes. 
  I hope, we hope, that the voices of sobriety and 
responsibility will prevail and that this accident will, at the 
same time, be the last large-scale accident in this war and that 
a lesson will be learned from all this that will expedite the 
peace process and bring it to a finale as soon as possible.

  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 7 (TANJUG) -- President Slobodan 
Milosevic of Serbia and head of the UNPROFOR mission Yasushi 
Akashi in Belgrade on Monday assessed that the signing of a 
peace agreement accounted for the most efficient way to end the 
war in the ex-Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Present at the talks also were UNPROFOR Commander for Bosnia 
General Michael Rose, special envoy of the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees Nicholas Morris, and Yugoslav Foreign 
Minister Vladislav Jovanovic. 
  The signing of a peace agreement would avert or discourage 
the forces opting for continued war, it was assessed at the 
talks. 
  The evasion of a peace agreement by war option protagonists, 
assisted by foreign factors, can only flare up war conflicts 
bearing heavy consequences om regional peace and stability, it 
was cautioned at the talks. 
  On Sunday, the Moslem side rejected a draft accord on 
lasting 
truce in the Sarajevo region as drawn up by Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic and Asushi Yakashi. The Moslems also turned 
down a peace plan by the European Union (E.U.) in Geneva twenty 
days ago, opting for war and trying to win out military 
intervention against Bosnian Serbs. 
  A resumption of political talks, to which the Serb side 
commits itself and on which the international community would 
have to insist strongly, is the only rasonable road to peace, it 
was said at the talks. 
  It was pointed out that Serbia, as it has been doing so far, 
would lend support to peace efforts by the United Nations in the 
areas of former Yugoslavia.

<F P=106> [Statements by Yasushi Akashi, special envoy of the UN </F>
secretary general for the former Yugoslavia, and General Michael 
Rose, UN Protection Forces commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
after talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in 
Belgrade on 7 February; all questions and answers are in English 
with superimposed translation into Serbo-Croatian -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. 
Akashi, how do you assess the talks with President Milosevic and 
what was the purpose of your visit? 
  [Akashi] For me, this was an opportunity to discuss all 
essential questions, promote peace, and reduce tensions in the 
region for which I am responsible. It was a good, business-like 
discussion on numerous concrete issues. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Could you be more specific, 
please? 
  [Akashi] Yes. We discussed the development of the situation 
in Sarajevo. We also discussed the issue of Srebrenica and 
Tuzla. We discussed ways to improve the humanitarian aid in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and also the normalization of relations 
between Serbia and Croatia. Therefore, the talks touched upon 
numerous issues. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Was Milosevic in favor of 
Sarajevo's demilitarization? 
  [Akashi] Yes, he truly hopes for progress on the issue of UN 
administration of Sarajevo and the town's demilitarization, even 
before the peace agreement is reached. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] I have a question for Michael 
Rose. Do you hold any new information about the explosion in 
Sarajevo? 
  [Rose] Which one are you referring to? 
  [Unidentified correspondent] The bomb that fell on Saturday, 
it is impossible to say where it came from. However, some 
people already accuse the Serbs. 
  [Rose] We base our assessments on technical analyses. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] General, how would you comment 
on such a destructive effect of only one mortar bomb? 
  [Rose] The destruction was great for one bomb alone. The 
reason that it occurred is that it landed on a market stall at 
waist height. For this reason, the effect was to devastating. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Akashi, what do you think 
is the future of the Geneva talks? 
  [Akashi] President Milosevic assured me that the talks on 10 
February will be held and that topics of interest will be 
discussed by the three sides. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] How do you comment on possible 
air strikes against the positions of the Bosnian Serbs? 
  [Akashi] I believe that the NATO Council will examine the 
question of air strikes in relation to the proposal by the UN 
secretary general. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] What will your report to the UN 
Security Council contain regarding the present situation? 
  [Akashi] I will inform the UN Security Council about the 
reports and findings that I have already sent to New York. My 
latest report, of yesterday, referred to an immediate and total 
cease-fire. We will continue with our efforts even though there 
have been no results so far as a cease-fire would be extremely 
useful to reduce tensions and prevent tragedies like the ones we 
have seen in Sarajevo in the last few days. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Are you worried that if strikes 
do take place this will escalate the entire matter? 
  [Akashi] I believe that everybody is definitely worried 
about the consequences of any sort of air strikes. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Are you worried for UN troops 
in Bosnia now? 
  [Akashi] We are worried about many things, yes. O.K.? 
Thank you very much. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic by </F>
Snezana Rodic and unidentified correspondent in Belgrade on 7 
February -- recorded] 
  [Text] Mr. Jovanovic, how do you assess today's 
[Milosevic-Akashi] talks? 
  [Jovanovic] I view them as encouraging, especially after 
what has happened recently. Namely, it is evident that the 
efforts to overcome the present situation and steer it back on 
the negotiating path to find a solution by political means in 
peace are again gaining in prominence. It is evident that Mr. 
Akashi is a man of peace, dialogue, and negotiations, and not a 
man of confrontation, threats, ultimatums, or punishment. On 
the other hand, the entire situation, despite this tragic event, 
contains elements of political dynamism [sentence as heard]. 
For example, Lord Owen and President Karadzic yesterday held 
very enterprising talks about Sarajevo and its placement under 
the UN administration without waiting for the final peace 
settlement. On the other hand, there is talk about the 
relaxation of the situation in Sarajevo itself, which is also 
encouraging. There has been some progress in the talks 
concerning Tuzla airport. 
  A meeting in Geneva is forthcoming at which, beside the 
examination of the measures of trust, the issue of Sarajevo in 
the above mentioned context should also be discussed. Finally, 
a meeting of the neighboring countries of the former Yugoslavia 
at a ministerial level will also probably take place, which 
means that the political momentum has been preserved despite all 
the temptations and we should expect further development in this 
direction rather than in the direction of confrontation and 
escalation of the war. 
  [Unidentified reporter, in English with superimposed 
simultaneous translation into Serbo-Croatian] Mr. Minister how 
do you assess the danger of air attacks on the Serbian positions 
in Bosnia. Is this possible? 
  [Jovanovic, in English with superimposed simultaneous 
translation into Serbo-Croatian] I believe that this is 
possible in this war, but not likely, I hope, because everybody 
is aware that this would not help in the present situation and 
definitely would not assist the peace process. First of all, 
the strain of the entire situation and the solution to the 
crisis can only be seen within the framework of the peace 
process and not in the possibility of escalating the conflict 
further. Finally, political activities, a visit by Mr. Akashi 
and the cochairmen not merely to Belgrade, but to some other 
counties in this region are the best proof that the majority of 
the international community believes that a political and not a 
military solution is needed here. We are definitely inclined to 
believe that the solution to the problem lies in the rejection 
of the existing structure of political negotiations. 
  [Unidentified reporter, in English with superimposed 
simultaneous translation into Serbo-Croatian] Do you foresee 
what will happen in Geneva? 
  [Jovanovic, in English with superimposed simultaneous 
translation into Serbo-Croatian] If it were up to us, peace can 
take place anytime. The lack of peace will depend upon the side 
that has been opposed to peace. Unfortunately, this side is 
still not in a mood to assist the peace. They prefer to 
obstruct the peace, however, there are chances that even this 
side might turn more cooperative in comparison to the readiness 
of the majority of the international community to assist the 
peace process and not the continuation of the war.

  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 7 (TANJUG) -- Co-chairman of the 
international conference on the former Yugoslavia David Owen 
said here Monday that nobody wanted air strikes on artillery 
positions around Sarajevo, the capital of the war-shattered 
former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Only someone who is crazy could want these air strikes, Owen 
said adding however that the present situation in which so many 
people were being killed, like in Sarajevo on Saturday, could no 
longer be tolerated. He made this statement after his meeting 
with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic Monday. 
  The mortar shell, fired Saturday from positions still 
undetermined by UNPROFOR, killed 68 and injured almost 200 
persons. 
  Owen described as extremely important his meeting with 
Milosevic which was also attended by the second co-chairman on 
the conference of the former Yugoslavia Thorvald Stoltenberg and 
Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic. 
  One of the main topics discussed was the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and ways of ending it, as well as ways of 
preventing tragedies like the one that happened in Sarajevo on 
Saturday, Lord Owen said. 
  In answer to questions about air strikes Owen said he 
favoured negotiations and expressed hope that through 
negotiations steps would be adopted to prevent tragedies like 
the one in Sarajevo. 
  Concerning his talks Sunday evening with the president of 
the 
Bosnian Serb Republic Radovan Karadzic Owen said that Karadzic 
accepted the proposal to negotiate about the demilitarization of 
Sarajevo and its placement under a two-year UN administration. 
  Lord Owen announced that the talks on Sarajevo set for 
Thursday would discuss confidence-building measures and not the 
global peace settlement for the Bosnian crisis.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lord David Owen, cochairman of the </F>
conference on former Yugoslavia, by Zoran Jevdjovic after talks 
with Serbian President Milosevic in Belgrade on 7 February; in 
English with superimposed translation into Serbo-Croatian -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Owen] We really must be very quick because I must 
arrive in Brussels to attend the meeting of the European Union 
foreign ministers. 
  We had very useful and important talks with the president 
[Milosevic]. We discussed regional issues, as well as the issue 
of peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the ways to avoid tragedies 
like the one that occurred in Sarajevo. 
  [Jevdjovic] It has been reported that Butrus-Ghali had 
sought authorization for the use of air strikes. Are we any 
closer to these air strikes now? 
  [Owen] I hope that through the negotiations we will be able 
to avoid tragedies like the one that had happened in Sarajevo. 
Last night in Zvornik, Mr. Stoltenberg and I received Dr. 
Karadzic's consent that he would negotiate with the UN 
administration on the demilitarization of Sarajevo. Therefore, 
we can make progress. Mr. Akashi and the UN generals will try 
to find an agreement on military steps that are necessary to 
ensure a true cease-fire and demilitarization in phases. We are 
negotiating, and we hope that this can be accomplished. 
  Only an idiot wants the air strikes. On the other hand, only 
idiots can further tolerate the situation in which many people 
are losing their lives, as in Sarajevo on Saturday. This is a 
question of a sensible solution. The way I understood the 
letter from the UN secretary general, he is seeking the 
authorization of the NATO Council. Let us recall that NATO is 
supposed to follow UN policy. The United Nations does not want 
to be a warring side but wants to remain objective. However, it 
must protect the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] and the UNPROFOR 
mandate. Namely, UNPROFOR has a mandate in relations to 
Sarajevo, which is to stop the shelling of Sarajevo and the 
infantry attacks and clashes on the lines of contact. 
  The Bosnian Government Army and the army of the Bosnian 
Serbs 
should sign an agreement that would deal with both problems, the 
situation regarding the infantry, the situation on the field, 
and the situation regarding heavy arms around Sarajevo. 
  [Jevdjovic] Did Mr. Karadzic agree to the project of 
Sarajevo's demilitarization? 
  [Owen] Yes, he is willing to negotiate with the UN 
administration. We hope that this will be discussed in detail 
with the United Nations on a daily basis. This should have 
happened yesterday. It could appear on the agenda of the 
meeting dedicated to the measures of trust, which is scheduled 
to take place in Geneva on Thursday [10 February]. The Thursday 
meeting in Geneva is not a meeting on a global peace solution. 
If something like this happens and it is discussed, then fine, 
but it is a meeting dedicated to the measures of trust.

  [Text] Belgrade, 7 Feb (TANJUG) -- The White Rose and the 
New Byzantium-Orthodox Concord today warned the NATO Council 
that if Bosnian Serbs positions were attacked, these 
nongovernmental organizations would mount a "complete and total" 
blockade of the Danube "for a one-year period." 
  It is noted in a statement signed by Radomir Smiljanic, 
president of the White Rose and of the Danube Blockade Council, 
that "we all genuinely and deeply mourn the innocent victims of 
Sarajevo, but at the same time we wish to draw attention to the 
fact that for the fourth time the unscrupulous propaganda 
machine of the Bosnian Muslim government and world agents have 
used the same trick." 
  "The suffering of the innocent is used to move the world 
public and NATO's military power against the Serbs and to 
undermine the Geneva peace process," the statement says and goes 
on to warn the NATO Council "under no circumstances to take 
military action or mount air strikes against the Serbs in former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Serbs Must Be Included in the </F>
Constitution"] 
  [Text] The newly appointed leadership of the Democratic 
Party of the Serbs in Macedonia (DPS) denies the report signed 
by the party's ex-president Boro Ristic and by the Macedonian 
Internal Minister Ljubomir Frckovski, saying the Serbian people 
does not accept that signature. For the new DPS leader, Dragisa 
Miletic, the way chosen by the Serbian people is much more 
agreeable -- they demand an explicit constitutional recognition 
of the Serbs, as a guarantee of their equal rights with all 
other minorities in Macedonia. In other words, the Macedonian 
Government is to include the Serbs in its official list of 
minorities in the country, in 18 months. Otherwise, the next 
step of DPS will be raising of the Serbian question in Macedonia 
in front of international institutions, Miletic said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Martin Danes </F>
in Prague; date not given: "European Integration Is Not Just a 
Matter of Institutions"] 
  [Text] [Danes] What was the most important thing you 
brought back from the World Economic Forum held in Davos last 
weekend? 
  [Klaus] Two things: On the one hand, the feeling that 
people know about the Czech Republic and that what they know 
about it are positive things. And, on the other, the 
observation that puts my previous statement into the correct 
context: that we are not at the center of the world, that there 
are a great many extraordinarily interesting and stimulating 
things going on in the world, and that it is necessary to listen 
carefully to other people. 
  [Danes] In your speech in Davos, you emphasized the 
differences between the individual countries in Europe before 
their current integration. According to some observers, 
including those in the West, by placing such an emphasis on the 
differences, you are damaging our republic's starting position 
for its gradual incorporation into the European Union. Are they 
not right? 
  [Klaus] First of all, I do not know if the formulation of 
your question--"emphasized the differences"--is correct. I 
emphasized something else. I said that, if we analyze Europe's 
current development--when I say "Europe," I do not mean the 
abstract continent but the flesh-and-blood people who live in 
it--we have to be careful that we adjoin its success or failure 
to factors that really gain recognition for it and that, on the 
contrary, we do not adjoin factors to it that do not gain 
recognition for it. I said that the fundamental reason for West 
Europe's success in recent decades has been the social system in 
these countries and not this or that supranational institution 
that lumps Europe together. I cited the example that our 
tragedy was not CEMA but the communist regime. This is also 
valid symmetrically vice versa. 
  [Danes] This is valid symmetrically vice versa for what? 
  [Klaus] Even in West Europe, the dominant factor was not the 
influence of the European integrative process but maintaining a 
free system based economically on private ownership and so on. 
This conclusion applies to the past, the present, and certainly 
the future--that is, I was not reproaching anyone in my speech. 
It was merely an attempt to analyze the factors that influence 
the current situation in Europe. We can then discuss what 
percentage share this additional influence--that is, the 
establishment of external integration--has had, apart from the 
aforementioned dominant influence, in Europe's success. 
  [Danes] Nevertheless, our state certainly desires 
integration with the European Union.... 
  [Klaus] Our state, in any case, wants to integrate with 
Europe and merge with Europe in all possible structures. 
Undoubtedly, to achieve this, it is necessary to enter into 
European institutions and organizations. However, I can 
integrate myself institutionally and noninstitutionally. For 
example, I can do so economically by abolishing customs barriers 
and all sorts of obstacles to trade. Another possibility is that 
I will integrate myself on an organizationally institutional 
sphere, but this is only one method. 
  [Danes] According to press reports, in Switzerland you also 
admitted to the possibility of our budget policy's transition 
from a neutral to an active one. In your opinion, when should a 
change of this order take place? Is it intended to take the 
wind from Milos Zeman's sails before he had even gathered it? 
  [Klaus] No, I must disappoint you. I never said anything of 
the kind. This was merely a figment of the imagination of some 
editor or commentator concerning my speech to Swiss bankers on 
Monday [31 January] evening in Wolfsberg. Perhaps this editor 
got hold of the German text of my speech. It contained a 
written addendum, which I did not refer to in my speech. This 
was a theoretical analysis of the kind of economic situation in 
which budget policy has to be restrictive, neutral, and 
expansive. It says there that no East European country has yet 
reached the stage at which it could transfer to an expansive 
policy, regardless of whether this makes any sense at all. It 
is still my opinion that an expansive budget policy does not 
make any sense. 
  [Danes] As chairman of the Civic Democratic Party, are you 
worried about competition from the right? I am referring to the 
newly evolving party, whose ranks include, among others, the 
publisher of CESKY DENIK, Josef Kudlacek. 
  [Klaus] I am really not worried about this competition. 
These people are not interested in integrating the right wing, 
as they falsely dub their political venture. They are merely 
interested in making a name for themselves and in asserting 
their very extreme view of our current situation. If they 
succeed for a while in uniting a couple of people from various 
political parties, people who in our already maturing political 
spectrum have always remained ostentatiously in lilliputian 
parties of absolutely negligible significance, let them do so. 
I have absolutely nothing to add to this. 
  [Danes] Do you think they have any hope of getting into 
parliament? 
  [Klaus] In my opinion, certainly not.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Viktor Krejci </F>
in Prague; date not given: "A Firm Exchange Rate Is the Axis of 
Our Transformation"] 
  [Text] [Krejci] Could you explain, concretely and simply, 
why you think the Czech Republic should not hasten to implement 
the full convertibility of the koruna? 
  [Klaus] This is one of the many topics in which--I do not 
know why--correspondents get the feeling that they could find 
another chink of disagreement between politicians. I proclaim 
that, for the economic part of the government,, and also for the 
state banks and other institutions, this is not a matter-of-fact 
dispute. We are conducting a detailed study of the requirements 
for this step and the most suitable time to implement it. 
  There is absolute convertibility without any restrictions in 
few places--perhaps only in Hong Kong. All other countries have 
some form of regulation. So, progress from one phase of 
convertibility to another is simply relative and continuous and 
has nothing to do with political symbolism. 
  [Krejci] What are the advantages and disadvantages of such a 
step? 
  [Klaus] It goes without saying that the introduction of full 
convertibility has certain advantages, but it also has some 
disadvantages. There are three disadvantages, for which a 
gradual approach is necessary: First, the axis of our entire 
economic transformation is secured economically by a firm 
nominal exchange rate and by maintaining this exchange rate as 
the Archimedes point of the whole economic system. On the other 
hand, implementing full convertibility requires that this idea 
be abandoned and that a flexible exchange rate be introduced. 
  Second, introducing full convertibility means, to a certain 
extent, losing the autonomous nature of the state's monetary and 
financial--that is, macroeconomic--policy. This is fine in 
cases in which a country lags far behind the general liberal 
tendencies of its neighboring partners, and the world drags it 
from its inadequate foundation to somewhere else. This, 
however, does not apply to our country. Our monetary and 
financial policy is quite deliberate, quite rational, and does 
not have to be "disciplined" by our neighbors. The situation is 
rather the reverse. Moreover, the policy of our neighbors may 
have its own logic, different from that of our country, which 
has, at the moment, different tasks than standard European 
states. 
  And, finally, third: Introducing full convertibility indeed 
means exposing ourselves too much in the sense that we would 
enter into the realm of rapid movements of speculative capital 
that flees from one country to another, where it seems that the 
interest rate conditions are a little better. This is an 
instability that our transforming economy can do without at the 
moment. 
  [Krejci] What must be done now in this regard? 
  [Klaus] Other aspects of the concept of convertibility must 
gradually be liberated. Liberalizing what the citizen may 
exchange is also, undoubtedly, associated with this. The task 
is to create an attractive and pleasant environment for foreign 
investors, who now have the possibility to transfer money back 
to their own countries. 
  Therefore, I do not see a preponderance of reasons for 
immediately dealing with full convertibility. Additional 
analyses indicate that we are talking about a medium to 
long-term program.

  [Text] Prague February 4 (CTK) -- Government delegations 
from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland met today 
for the first session of the Joint Committee of the countries of 
the Central European Agreement, during which they considered the 
present state of trade between themselves and with the rest of 
the world. 
  The delegations were led by Czech Industry and Trade 
Minister 
Vladimir Dlouhy, Hungarian Minister for International Economic 
Relations Bela Kadar, Polish Minister for Foreign Economic 
Cooperation Leslaw Podkanski and Slovak Economic Minister Jan 
Ducky. 
  The introductory evaluation of the Central European Free 
Trade Association's [CEFTA] agreement, for the short time which 
it has been in force, confirmed that the mechanism was effective 
in its support of the aims of the contracting parties, and was 
thus contributing to the development of international trade and 
the world economy. The report announced the near completion of 
the negotiations which had been taking place in the last few 
months on the further lowering of tariffs and other obstructions 
for industrial products and the extending of concessions for 
agricultural products, in the interest of the continuing 
liberalisation of trade. During today's meeting, ministers 
expressed willingness to continue in attempts to also remove the 
remaining tariff and non-tariff obstructions to trade, including 
obstructions in the agricultural sector. 
  The delegations firmly believe that by the end of 1997 a 
free-trade zone will be formed for the 65 million inhabitants of 
the CEFTA countries. The CEFTA agreement was a good example for 
the liberalisation of trade, the ministers said, adding that 
they welcomed the process of negotiation and implementation of 
bilateral agreements on free trade between the individual CEFTA 
countries and third countries. 
  Association agreements with the European Union, as well as 
the agreements on free trade with the European Free Trade 
Association (EFTA) were the basic means by which the 
obstructions to a considerable amount of trade would be blown 
away in a relatively short time, and were important milestones 
in the integration process of CEFTA countries into international 
trade, the ministers said. They expressed the hope that in the 
future no measures with protectionist elements would be passed, 
such as anti-dumping measures, if these were not fully justified. 
  As far as the results of the Copenhagen summit of the 
European Community were concerned, the ministers praised the 
additional trade concessions offered to the CEFTA countries, 
although they also said they expected the European Union to 
extend the trade concessions further. 
  The ministers praised the individual and joint initiatives 
and the measures approved by the Organisation for European 
Cooperation and Development (OECD) which improved the 
accessibility of their markets to goods from CEFTA countries. 
They said they also believed that the very sober appliance of 
protective measures was of great importance for the maintenance 
of the dynamics of development, the integration of national 
economies and the liberalisation of trade within the CEFTA 
agreement. The ministers also expressed their great pleasure at 
the declared interest of the United States to further liberalise 
trade with the CEFTA countries, adding that during further 
negotiations with the United States they expected to be able to 
improve conditions for access to U.S. markets. The CEFTA 
agreement countries expressed satisfaction at the successful end 
to the Uruguay Round of GATT talks, whose results represented an 
important step in the direction of the further liberalisation of 
goods and services. Confidence in the international trade 
system had been increased by the agreement concerning the 
establishment of the World Trade Organisation, the ministers 
said.

  [Text] Prague Feb 3 (CTK) -- Polish Minister for Economic 
Cooperation With Foreign Countries Leslaw Podkanski today said 
it was both feasible and necessary to shorten the transition 
period towards liberalisation of free trade from eight to five 
years. 
  He said this at a press conference after a meeting between 
Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus and four ministers in charge of 
trading between countries-signatories of the Central European 
Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA). 
  Klaus said that the agreement proved that the Central 
European countries were capable of free trading, which can help 
in their incorporation into European structures. 
  The ministers from Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech 
Republic -- Bela Kadar, Leslaw Podkanski, Jan Ducky and Vladimir 
Dlouhy -- agreed that even if the transition period was 
shortened and trade liberalisation achieved there would still be 
certain exceptions, which would not fall within the overall 
liberalisation. They said agriculture was one of the most 
problematic areas. 
  The ministers agreed that the CEFTA countries would 
individually seek conclusion of free trade agreements with other 
countries -- Hungary with Slovenia and Croatia, Poland with 
Lithuania and Slovenia, Slovakia and the Czech Republic with 
Turkey, Estonia and Romania.

  [Text] Prague Feb 4 (CTK) -- If the Slovak market is to be 
protected from imports, the reason concerns the balance 
payments, Economics Minister Jan Ducky told CTK today. 
  He was referring to the statement made by Slovak Premier 
Vladimir Meciar at the Wednesday [2 February] meeting of the 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), of which he is 
chairman, announcing protective measures against imports even 
from the Czech Republic. 
  Ducky said the intention was to protect the Slovak currency. 
The instability of the Slovak crown could cause problems with 
the exchange of goods. He stressed there was no contradiction 
between Meciar's statement and his own participation in talks on 
trade liberalisation. 
  The individual partners of the Central European Free Trade 
Agreement (CEFTA) do not agree on the timing of steps towards 
liberalisation. While Slovakia and the Czech Republic are 
progressing towards it, Poland and Hungary are moving "more 
slowly," he said. 
  Ducky said the idea of expanding CEFTA, possibly by the 
inclusion of Slovenia, Bulgaria and Romania, was good because, 
given the competition, the free trade zone needed about 200 
million people. The present CEFTA countries have a total 
population of 65 million. 
  The reason why mutual trade within CEFTA was developing only 
slowly was the fact that the member states were first of all 
attempting to try out independent policies, he explained. What 
is more, since their economies were all bogged down with heavy 
industry, the countries experienced the same shortages and 
surpluses.

  [Text] Vranov nad Dyji, South Moravia Feb 3 (CTK) -- The 
final number of troops in the Slovak Army will be decreased from 
the current 42,000 to 35,000, Slovak Defence Minister Imrich 
Andrejcak said today after meeting with his Czech counterpart, 
Antonin Baudys. 
  Baudys confirmed that by the end of 1995 the Czech Army 
would 
reach its final size -- 65,000 troops. He said, however, that 
further decrease in the army size was not being considered thus 
far because, Baudys said, following the euphoria after the fall 
of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet bloc, "a more 
realistic standpoint is gaining the upper hand and the 
restriction of armed forces in individual countries is coming to 
a halt." He added that the share of military expenditures in 
the state budgets of a number of European countries has begun to 
grow again.

Daskalov discussed current issues of Bulgarian foreign policy. 
Presidential Spokesman Valentin Stoyanov supplies further 
details: 
  [Begin Stoyanov recording] Basic attention was devoted to 
the visit of Lord Owen and Stoltenberg to Bulgaria and the 
forthcoming Geneva meeting of the foreign ministers of countries 
bordering on former Yugoslavia. Bulgaria's position is as 
follows: It will participate in the meeting only if the foreign 
ministers of all invited countries participate. The president 
expressed his doubt whether this meeting could contribute 
anything to achieving peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, especially 
against the background of Saturday's [5 February] massacre in 
Sarajevo. 
  It was again pointed out that Bulgaria's position on the 
situation in former Yugoslavia remains unchanged. Bulgaria 
opposes any armed involvement in the conflict of Balkan or other 
countries bordering on former Yugoslavia. In the past other 
countries joined this position, and recently Greece repeated 
that it adheres to the same position. [end recording]

of certain preposterous attacks of the Greater Romania Party 
[PRM] Senator Corneliu Vadim Tudor. In the pages of the 
weeklies ROMANIA MARE and POLITICA, the defense minister 
together with other officers of the Romanian Army, are described 
and called names in the most aberrant possible manner. 
  The PRM senator's saraband of curses and slander has a very 
banal cause: Every available means must be taken to promote his 
brother, that is, Colonel Marcu Tudor, to the rank of general 
because that is what Corneliu Vadim Tudor wants. 
  General Niculae Spiroiu considers the request of the PMR 
senator as aberrant. Because he dared to defy Vadim, the 
minister of defense became the mocking subject of the ROMANIA 
MARE and POLITICA magazines. 
  After a letter addressed to Oliviu Gherman, the president of 
the Senate, in which he requests that Senator Corneliu Vadim 
Tudor's behavior should be discussed by the Commission of 
Discipline and Immunity of the Senate, Lieutenant General 
Niculae Spiroiu is back again. 
  Yesterday, on 2 February, he addressed an open letter to the 
presidents of the two chambers of the parliament, in which he 
broadly discusses the scandalous situation in which the Romanian 
Army and its minister are placed. Niculae Spiroiu requested 
that the Commissions in change of defense, public order, and 
national security should be convened in a meeting and thus, he 
should be given the opportunity to explain the aberrant 
situation and the very serious accusations of the PRM senator. 
Until now, presidents Adrian Nastase and Oliviu Gherman have 
had a more than tolerant attitude toward Vadim Tudor's abnormal 
attacks directed against the Romanian Army.

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, Feb 5 (AFP) -- A shell fired on 
Sarajevo's main market place killed at least 58 people, many of 
them elderly shoppers, and injured 140 others on Saturday, 
hospital and mortuary staff said. [passage omitted] 
  Two UN peacekeepers -- a Frenchman and a Canadian -- drove 
to 
the site in a jeep and offered to help, but were jostled by an 
angry crowd and forced to leave, a French photographer at the 
scene said. But other peacekeepers took seven of the wounded to 
the UN hospital in an armoured troop transport vehicle. 
  The attack came a day after mortar shells killed eight 
civilians, including two girls aged eight and nine, in the 
suburb of Dobrinja as they were queueing for food aid. 
  The new British commander of UN forces in Bosnia, Lieutenant 
General Michael Rose, said Saturday an investigation had shown 
"with certainty" that Bosnian Serbs were responsible for 
Friday's attack. [passage omitted] 
  Bosnian Serb military commander General Manojlo Milanovic 
protested to the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) about 
"accusations from the Moslem authorities that the Serb army had 
committed the massacre" on Friday, the Bosian Serb news agency 
SNRA reported. 
  Milanovic threatened to block relief convoys travelling 
across Serb-held territory from Monday unless a joint commission 
was set up by Sunday morning, including Serb, Moslem and UN 
experts, to investigate Saturday's massacre. 
  Bosnian Vice-President Ejup Ganic meanwhile blamed the Serbs 
and called for "an end to the arms embargo (against Bosnian 
authorities) so they can defend themselves." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency </F>
President Alija Izetbegovic in Sarajevo by Mehmet Ali Birand in 
the studio; from the "32d Day" program -- live, in English with 
simultaneous translation into Turkish; transcribed from the 
English] 
  [Text] [Birand] Mr. President, I would like to express 
the heartfelt sympathy of the Turkish public. We share your 
horror and your sorrow. Would you now please tell me what is 
the actual situation in Sarajevo? Is the bombing still going on? 
  [Izetbegovic] The bombing continues, but with less intensity 
than before. But the Serbian snipers from the neighboring 
fields are very active today. They roam the streets, and it is 
very dangerous. 
  [Birand] Now, sir, do you feel that this time the West will 
really move and take military action? 
  [Izetbegovic] Just an initiative by Butrus Butrus-Ghali, as 
you know, maybe, and today from the European Union also. In my 
opinion, a military action is probable. If I have to assess the 
possibility, I could say that it is 50-50. 
  [Birand] You are not 100-percent sure. It is still 50-50? 
  [Izetbegovic] Yes. 
  [Birand] Do you believe that the bombing of the surrounding 
hills of Sarajevo will deter the Serbs, or do you think that 
only a very strong military action with ground forces will stop 
the Serbs? 
  [Izetbegovic] In my opinion, an air strike, an action from 
the air, would be enough, would be sufficient. We do not expect 
any ground operation. This ground operation is not necessary, 
because we have enough of our boys to fight. 
  [Birand] I see. How much longer can you hold if the West 
does not take any military action and restricts its power to 
just lip service? 
  [Izetbegovic] Now it is a matter of survival. We will never 
surrender. We cannot surrender. It is a question of to be or 
not to be, to live or to die. We will never surrender, and the 
Serbs can never enter Sarajevo. 
  [Birand] Mr. President, why is the West not moving? Do you 
have an explanation? 
  [Izetbegovic] What can you say? The West is at the same 
time rich and poor. It is at the same time strong and weak. It 
is a matter of moral weakness in the Western world. They are 
not ready to fight. 
  [Birand] Mr. President, now you are speaking directly to 
millions of Turkish citizens. Now tell us what we can do to 
help you. 
  [Izetbegovic] I am very happy to greet your listeners and 
the Turkish people. I would like to convey my cordial greetings 
to your listeners. I would like to first congratulate the 
coming Ramadan and to thank for all your support and help. We 
have many friends and brothers in the world, all over the world. 
We know that you are our brothers and our friends. Thank you 
for all that. We do not feel alone in the world. Thank you. 
  [Birand] Mr. President, thank you very much indeed. 
  [Izetbegovic] Thank you.

Radovan Karadzic in Pale by correspondent Jacques Merlino in a 
Paris studio on 7 February -- recorded; Karadzic speaks in 
Serbo-Croatian with superimposed French translation] 
  [Text] The Bosnian Serb leader remains as arrogant as ever. 
Radovan Karadzic is offering to negotiate the demilitarization 
of Sarajevo. Jacques Merlino spoke to him this evening: 
  [Karadzic] Yes, we plan, within the framework of the overall 
arrangement for finding peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in 
particular in Sarajevo, to place Sarajevo itself under the 
jurisdiction of the United Nations for a period of 30 years. 
But only Sarajevo itself, because what is most important for us 
is to guarantee the security of the Serbian areas of the town so 
that they are not attacked, and also to avoid the kind of 
massacres which have already been suffered in other 
Serb-populated areas. We intend to do everything possible to 
ensure that peace is found first in Sarajevo and then throughout 
Bosnia. 
  [Merlino] Do you accept the order to pull back your heavy 
artillery and to place it under UN control? 
  [Karadzic] If peace comes to Sarajevo, Serbian artillery, 
just as Muslim artillery, will effectively be controlled by 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] at locations decided upon by 
UNPROFOR. Having said this, without signing an overall peace, 
it is impossible for us to completely withdraw our artillery. 
We are for peace but the Muslims are not. They want to 
continue the war, and we therefore need the guarantee that the 
Muslims will also withdraw their heavy weaponry.

<F P=106> [Article by Gojko Marinkovic: "Signatures From Foggy </F>
Karadjordjevo"] 
  [Text] We cannot remember the last time when [Croatian 
President] Franjo Tudjman was so cheery, excited, joyful, 
euphoric, and even somewhat melancholic, as he was last 
Wednesday, when in Geneva the declaration on the gradual 
normalization of the relations between the republic of Croatia 
and the FRY was signed. The return to the same state as 16 
months ago, when a similar, but even more precise, agreement 
between Tudjman and [the then President of FRY] Dobrica Cosic 
was signed, has been assessed by the Croatian president as the 
most important document after the UN Security Council's 
Resolution 871. He also thinks that [Serbian Foreign Minister] 
Vladislav Jovanovic's signature in Milosevic's presence is 
actually the recognition of the sovereign Croatia, which opens 
possibilities for the inclusion of the UN Protection Areas 
[UNPAs] in the constitutional-legal system of Croatia in a 
peaceful way, and also that it is an enormous success of the 
Croatian policy that has improved the Croatian image in the 
world. 
  On hearing the news, most Croatian citizens felt surprised 
and confused, to put it mildly, and many of them wondered: What 
is that supposed to mean? The first TV opinion surveys, 
although probably well edited in favor of the president's 
policy, showed that people are already fed up with such and 
similar documents, because that was already the 77th meeting of 
the international community. In addition to such skepticism, 
and the usual answer "well, so far they have signed many 
documents," one could notice a certain relief, and desire that 
the war be finally brought to an end soon. So, as far as 
citizens are concerned, the support was quite spiritless and 
lethargic, but it cannot be said that Tudjman did not get it. 
<H5>  The Tide of Disagreements From the Opposition </H5>
  The entire tide of disagreements, criticisms, and remarks 
have, therefore, been delivered by the opposition parties. The 
most vociferous, but also the most categorical, has been Drazen 
Budisa, chairman of the strongest opposition party, the Croatian 
Social Liberal Party [HSLS]: "There is no justification for a 
policy that seeks an ally in the aggressor, while seeking an 
enemy in the other victim of the aggression. In that sense, we 
think that a priority of the Croatian state should be the 
accomplishment of an agreement with the political leadership of 
Bosnian-Herzegovinian Muslims, while this declaration will make 
the accomplishment of that agreement difficult. The relations 
with the FRY can become normal again only when the FRY 
recognizes the Croatian state within its internationally 
recognized borders, which is not done by this document," Budisa 
claims. 
  Slavko Mestrovic, secretary of the Croatian People's Party, 
welcomes the deceleration in the case if it leads toward a just 
peace, the reintegration of the occupied Croatian territories, 
the return of the refugees to their homes, and the cessation of 
the war. ``Croatia has very unpleasant experiences with 
Milosevic's regime. Some initiatives not only failed to bring 
about the expected improvements, but also helped Milosevic to 
recover and regain strength precisely at the moments when he was 
in the most difficult situation. He adroitly used those 
initiatives to preserve the regime in Serbia, as well as to 
improve the image of himself and Serbia in international public 
opinion. I am afraid that the same thing will happen now, 
because I firmly believe that Milosevic has not given up the 
platform of a greater Serbia. On the contrary, he cannot go 
back any more, since he has burnt all his bridges. He knows 
that a tribunal awaits him, to try him as a war criminal. 
  "Although the declaration does not mention 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, it may mean a certain political pressure 
aimed at forcing a settlement of the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina," Mestrovic explains his party's attitude. 
<H5>  Who Will Be Eating Grass? </H5>
  However, the Social-Democratic Party of Croatia [SDP] 
believes that, through this document, and above all by the 
announced opening of the governmental offices of the two states, 
the so-called FRY is de facto recognized, while, on the Croatian 
part, the initiative has been made for the sanctions to be 
lifted, being so far the only form of international pressure 
that has been put on the regime that actually carried out the 
aggression against Croatia, as well as against other neighboring 
countries, the regime that has been defined by the whole world 
as fascist, the regime in which human rights are brazenly 
ignored. 
  The Croatian signature on the document has actually 
strengthened and stabilized that regime. The SDP also raises a 
series of questions regarding the reported positive experiences 
in the joint efforts to speed up the peace process in former 
Yugoslavia, which is the basic goal of the declaration. "When 
did Milosevic make a peace-making move, when and where did he 
ever give up the concept of greater Serbia? When did he 
recognize Croatia in its internationally recognized borders? 
Did he not, only a month ago, organize elections on the 
territory of the state with which he has just signed the 
declaration? Is he not supporting the aggression these days 
against the Croatian enclaves in Bosnia- Herzegovina? When 
these questions receive answers we shall be happy to open, not 
only government offices in neighboring Serbia, but many other 
offices. At this moment, we cannot accept any legitimization of 
those who evidently committed the crime, while never doing 
anything to dissociate themselves from those crimes," the SPD 
officials say, stating their attitude. 
  The Croatian Peasants' Party [HSS] thinks that the 77th 
meeting in Geneva with Milosevic the Balkan Conqueror is neither 
the last, nor the first meeting, in the context of the Croatian 
triumphalism on one hand, and Byzantine maneuvers on the other. 
"We are afraid that the document is a piece of paper without 
guarantees. It is about Milosevic's policy that aims at finally 
contouring greater Serbia, for which he and his subjects are 
ready to eat grass [as published], and finally, it is about all 
the games regarding the possible lifting of the sanctions. Of 
course, an important factor is also the pressure by the 
international community that the issue of Bosnia should finally 
be settled, that is, it's partition. However, any agreement 
without the accord of the third party -- this time it is Muslims 
-- leaves Bosnia to play its role of the land of death, where 
the war continues, to the disadvantage of the Croatian people as 
well," the HSS reacts to the agreement. 
<H5>  Zagreb-Knin-Belgrade </H5>
  The reactions of other parties have been similar, but it is 
discernible in these quoted statements that one dilemma 
dominates in the majority of the criticisms, which is: Is the 
Croatian Government allowed to negotiate with war criminals and 
the regime that attacked Croatian territory? Milosevic is 
simply not to be trusted, while Tudjman is customarily 
reproached that he is actually rescuing Milosevic, while this 
time those accusations are going so far that Tudjman is being 
accused of pushing the lifting of the sanctions against Serbia. 
The other two crucial questions have to do with 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. True, Minister Jovanovic did state that the 
reintegration of Krajina into Croatia should be discussed at the 
Zagreb-Knin level, meaning that the issue of Krajina is an 
internal affair of Croatia, but have the Krajina presidential 
elections not been carried out precisely in Belgrade recently? 
True, in Croatia there are few statements expressing whether 
Milan Martic, who, in the second round, almost beat the already 
elected Milan Babic, would be more convenient than somebody 
else, but everybody knows that Martic is Milosevic's protegee, 
and that he, with his attitudes, perfectly fits in with the 
concept of greater Serbia, that is, the union of all Serbian 
states. Besides, the Serbian state-run television also 
considers Krajina to be a Serbian territory, so, for instance, 
in TV weather forecasts Krajina is regularly shown on the chart 
as a part of Yugoslavia, while Zadar is a part of Krajina. 
Still, there are people who think that Martic's win is good for 
Croatia, because he, being Milosevic's direct vassal, must be 
obedient. Nevertheless, in any case, Serbian official policy 
has not so far by a single move shown that Tudjman is right in 
claiming that the Geneva declaration is the first step toward 
the reintegration of Krajina, which is a primary thing for him, 
because, in a certain way, he has given up Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
contenting himself with something that has never been questioned. 

<H5>    Croatia Has Recognized the Serbian Republic </H5>
  Not only the Croatian opposition, but also many foreign 
media 
houses, and even diplomats, have assessed that the 
Croato-Serbian agreement constitutes a pressure on Muslims, so 
that Zvonko Lerotic, the president's personal adviser, states 
that "the Muslims are thereby forced to make similar agreements 
with Croats and Serbs, because it is suicide to wage war with 
two states that are about to find a common language." By this 
statement, Lerotic has almost confirmed the speculations that 
the agreement is about a military alliance of Croats and Serbs. 
Such theories, which are not alone in the international press, 
find support in another agreement that was also signed in Geneva 
-- which the Croatian opposition ostensibly did not notice, to 
the great surprise and almost astonishment of all, and 
consequently did not comment on, although the integral text was 
published in Croatian newspapers -- the agreement signed between 
Mile Akmadzic, on behalf of the Croatian Republic of 
Herceg-Bosna, and Nikola Koljevic, on behalf of the Serbian 
Republic, in which both sides emphasize that "there are no 
disputed issues between them that cannot be solved in a peaceful 
way." 
  Quote: "Two republics have decided to establish diplomatic 
relations, so that the Serbian Republic will open an office in 
Mostar, while the Croatian Republic of Herceg-Bosna will open an 
office in Sarajevo (Pale)." 
  Thus Croatia has actually eliminated the quotation marks 
from 
such terms as so-called, self-called, or self-proclaimed, 
thereby recognizing not only the FRY, but also the Serbian 
Republic. 
  In that act, many people are likely to see only a logical 
course of what was happening as early as in 1990 in 
Karadjordjevo, when Tudjman and Milosevic discussed, for the 
first time, the partition of Bosnia. However, as for the Croats 
and what they have now (of course, provided that no secret annex 
to the agreement exists), they did not need the war, because by 
it they only lost, rather than profited. Of course, the fact 
that Croatia did not start the war remains undisputed, but many 
are confused by the fact that the erstwhile ally has become the 
main enemy now, and cannot explain why that happened. 
  The Croatian estimates say that, by the Geneva agreement, 
the 
possibility of the second Serbo-Croatian war, which the foreign 
experts were quite positive might break out in spring, has been 
thereby removed, but, when speaking of Muslims, all 
possibilities remain open. One possibility is that Muslims 
accept what they are offered, and become reconciled with their 
defeat, because, as Lerotic says, it is insane to wage a war 
with two states that have come to an agreement. The second 
option is that the Muslims will continue the war, and accomplish 
at least some of their aspirations with the help of the 
international community that is not so unwilling to help them as 
is represented by both the Croatian and Serbian media. 
<H5>  Not a Single Shell Fell on Serbia </H5>
  Furthermore, when we add to all this the problems regarding 
the access to sea that is demanded by both the Serbian and the 
Muslim sides in Bosnia, when the questions of Bosnian Posavina 
[Bosnian side of the Sava River basin] and central Bosnia are 
still open to a degree, when the hostility among all three 
factions still exists, and above all that there are the issues 
of Sandzak, Kosovo, and Macedonia, then it can be said that the 
Geneva piece of paper is just a tiny step toward peace, and 
still far away from being called an historic one. Far more 
palpable proofs than, say, the reestablishment of the telephone 
connections between the FRY and Croatia will be necessary in 
order for us to be able to speak of the start of a peace 
process. Because, the Geneva signatures may as well be the 
beginning of an even more fierce war, even initiating new 
conflicts. That is to say, an attentive listener and reader may 
also have heard in the statements made by the FRY officials 
assessments that the declaration makes it possible for 
Yugoslavia and Serbia "to get down to settling other problems as 
well." It is obvious that it is not only the economy that those 
assessments refer to, although it is one of the key reasons why 
Milosevic needs a reconciliation with the West, and a deal with 
Tudjman regarding the lifting of the sanctions. Whether 
Milosevic will return the favor by relinquishing Krajina and 
recognizing Croatia in its internationally recognized borders is 
the key that will make it possible for Serbia to get down to 
settling those other problems. 
  What is particularly bothersome in all these options is 
that nobody in Croatia sees any reasonable alternative to 
Milosevic's regime, because now one can hear the bellicose 
sounds coming from the Serbian opposition lines as well. To a 
certain degree, the case is similar with the Croatian 
opposition, since it refuses any negotiations with war 
criminals, and, as a rule, is quite skeptical toward the Geneva 
declaration. 
  This "certain degree" refers above all to the unquestionable 
fact that not a single shell fell on Serbian ground during the 
war that was actually never officially declared, whereas one 
third of the Croatian territory is, as a matter of fact, 
devastated, while Croatia as a state is reduced to a few pieces 
of land. Moreover, Croatia is probably the only UN 
member-country, in addition to Bosnia-Herzegovina where the 
state is even more catastrophic, that does not know either what 
its territory is or how many citizens it has.

  [Text] Belgrade, 4 Feb (TANJUG)--Following the latest 
incidents on the border between Yugoslavia and Albania, the 
Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued the following 
statement: 
  "As the Yugoslav public is aware, the number of incidents on 
the Yugoslav-Albanian border, in which several Albanian citizens 
regrettably lost their lives while attempting to illegally cross 
into Yugoslavia, has recently increased. 
  "In order to discuss additional measures that could be 
taken, 
in the spirit of respect for the international and bilateral 
obligations that both countries have undertaken to prevent 
border incidents, the Yugoslav side has recently proposed to the 
relevant Albanian bodies that an extraordinary session of the 
main joint Yugoslav-Albanian commission for border incidents be 
held in Belgrade." 
  The statement goes on to say: "The normalization of 
relations 
on the Yugoslav-Albanian border would improve relations between 
the two countries, which the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, 
adhering to the principles of good-neighborliness, has as its 
lasting goal."

  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 9 (TANJUG) -- Two weeks after the 
introduction of the new Yugoslav economic programme retail 
prices in Belgrade stores have been reduced by a third on the 
average but have not resulted in a marked increase in the 
turnover because the population is on the verge of subsistence 
after a 20-month long international blockade. 
  Most people only buy bread, milk and the basic necessities. 
according to prices on Wednesday 747 dinars are needed for the 
subsistence of a family of four, the Belgrade statistics bureau 
assessed. The guranteed minimum wage in Yugoslavia (Serbia and 
Montenegro) is 20 new dinars (20 German Marks), and the average 
wage is 40 dinars. 
  There are virtually no customers for textile goods, 
clothing, 
shoes, furniture and household appliances even though stores 
offer the possibility of payment in two monthly installments and 
have cut the prices by 50-per cent. In the first four days of 
the implementation of the programme the retail price growth has 
dropped from 313 million per cent a month to 888 per cent. 
  The most serious problem for the experts who have drawn up 
the programme will be how to revive production which has come to 
a virtual standstill due to the stringent economic sanctions 
imposed on the country, which include an oil embargo. 
  Imports are banned and there is practically no market 
competition so that prices in Belgrade are the same, and often 
even higher, than in the largest cities of the world. At the 
same time wages are lower than in most African countries even 
though Yugoslavia had been at the level of a medium-developed 
European state before sanctions were introduced.

<F P=106> [Article by Misa Brkic: "Bureaucrats' Resistance Movement"] </F>
  [Text] "Pure nonsense!" Dragoslav Avramovic, creator of 
the super dinar, has repeated this characteristic sentence so 
often over the last 10 days that it has become proverbial. 
  Judging by the public acceptance and trust that the new 
dinar 
is enjoying, by the increase of the country's hard currency 
reserves by 19 million German marks [DM] (which accounts for 
almost 10 percent of the total reserves), and by the shockingly 
successful reduction of the inflation rate, the head of the 
rescue team of the Yugoslav economy should not have any reason 
to be too upset because (as he admitted himself) his trick has 
been successful so far. Avramovic's inborn optimism and his 
good manners are, however, overshadowed by the question of how 
theory can be transformed into practice. 
  For some of the measures that the Serbian and the Federal 
Government have put forward under the title of implementation of 
Avramovic's program, he finds only words of praise. These 
measures include higher prices for electricity and postal 
services, the introduction of a 1-percent tax on financial 
transactions, 1.5 million percent interest on bank accounts 
overdrafts, taxes on companies ranging from DM100 to DM10,000, 
receipts confirming the origin of the super dinars when they are 
changed into German marks in banks, and the decision to make it 
compulsory to exchange 30 dinars when crossing the border.... 
  All the decisions have several characteristics in common -- 
they prescribe, order, or prohibit certain things. They were 
signed by either Serbian Prime Minister Sainovic or FRY Prime 
Minister Kontic, and caused horror and panic in public. They 
forced Mr. Avramovic to go to the first telephone and call "the 
highest office in Serbia in charge of these matters" and ask 
them for intervention because this "nonsense" does not have 
anything to do with the original program approved by the 
"highest office in Serbia" on 5 December 1993. Against his 
wishes, Mr. Avramovic has been forcefully transformed into 
someone who has to watch over his program 24 hours a day in 
order to defend its original innocence. 
  From that point of view, the author of the program is 
becoming like the hero of Yugoslav mythology who was not 
successful in constructing the castle of Skadar on the Bojana 
River. Everything the hero built during the day some evil 
nymphs destroyed during the night. Yugoslav industrialists 
gathered in the Federal Chamber of Commerce the other day and 
correctly remarked that the program stated one thing, but that a 
completely different one was coming out under the hammer of the 
Serbian and federal administration. 
  If these observations are correct, and there is no reason 
why 
we should distrust the author of the program and economists who 
have been meticulously following all these events, it can now -- 
two weeks after the program was introduced -- be forecast with a 
high degree of probability where the points of resistance will 
be and which social, economic, and political lobbies could form 
"the resistance movement" against the latest economic reforms in 
Yugoslavia. Mr. Avramovic has indicated the "ambushes" himself: 
In several public speeches he has pointed the finger at the 
bureaucracy. It must be said that when he acted as a pragmatic 
politician he partly excused the state officials who, in their 
wish to make the program work successfully, made certain 
mistakes. However, when he acted as a former cold-blooded and 
merciless employee of the World Bank, he did not spare the 
Yugoslav bureaucrats. 
  Avramovic called the 50-year-old genetic code of the 
bureaucracy -- formed by prescription, prohibition, and central 
supervision of all economic processes -- a disaster, the logic 
of which could consume the program as fuel for retaining 
positions and interests within the ruling system. Based on the 
two-week experience, it could be concluded that the highest 
positions in this bureaucratic pyramid are occupied by people 
whose electronic eyes simply cannot recognize the creative 
handwriting of the retired World Bank expert. 
  I do not think that there is an organized conspiracy here; I 
think there is only the smell of the inherited decay that causes 
mental incompetence in some employees. That is why I believe 
that all those well-intentioned critics were right who warned 
that the "experienced personnel" from the old structures, who 
caused the collapse of the Yugoslav economy last year, could not 
change into bureaucrats of "a new generation" who should carry 
out the process of economic recovery. Simply because it is not 
enough to support the new economic view verbally; it is 
necessary to comprehend what a market economy means and what a 
economical and effective state must have. It must be repeated 
that several such programs failed because of this dual nature of 
bureaucratic structures. Mr. Avramovic is for this reason 
trying to get support for the fight against "the bureaucrats' 
resistance movement." 
  From some of the present announcements it can be seen that 
it 
will not be an easy task because the bureaucracy is already 
showing every intention of rescuing giant socialist companies, 
of directing investment, and of propagating state enterprise as 
a successful economic model. Unfortunately, there is no room in 
this model for Avramovic's free dinar, which has to care for 
itself. For that reason the initial success of the program must 
be relativized; we must remain optimistic and wait for some time 
to see the results.

  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 8 (TANJUG) -- The Government of the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on Tuesday gave its agreement for 
the opening of an office of the Republic of Croatia in Belgrade. 
  On the basis of a joint decleration, jointly signed by the 
representatives of Yugoslavia and Croatia in Geneva on January 
19, a Yugoslav bureau will also be opened in Zagreb. 
  The bureaus should secure communication between the two 
governments, ease the resolution of open issues, build up mutual 
trust and establish the normalization of good-neighbourly 
relations, cooperation and stability in the region, the Yugoslav 
government said. 
  The Yugoslav Government also adopted a platform for talks 
between the Yugoslav and Croatian vice-premiers -- Zeljko Simic 
and Mate Granic -- in Zagreb on February 12 and empowered Simic 
to sign a document on the status of the bureaus which will 
employ eight people each.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 8 (TANJUG) -- The Yugoslav Government 
Tuesday criticized the report of Tadeusz Mazowiecki on the human 
rights situation in Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) for 
omitting to mention that an illegal parastatal formation was 
active in Kosovo and Metohija which has the objective of joining 
the Serbian province to Albania. 
  The government sent its commentary on the Mazowiecki report 
to the participants of the 50th session of the UN Human Rights 
Commission being held in Geneva from January 31 to March 11. 
  The illegal grouping republic of Kosovo is trying to set up 
a 
parallel state apparatus and power structure with the open 
intention of separating the province from Serbia and the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia. 
  "In line with the norms of international law this must be 
treated as illegal activity jeopardizing the sovereignty and the 
territorial integrity of the country in which the minority 
lives," the commentary states. 
  Ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and Metohija reject the 
Constitution of the Republic of Serbia and have at an illegal 
assembly adopted the constitution of the so-called republic of 
Kosovo. The Albanian minority organized a referendum on 
secession with the aim of forming a parallel system of power. 
  The so-called Ministry of Defense of the "republic of 
Kosovo," is particularly active, it has war plans, organizes the 
formation and training of military units, keeps evidence of 
draftees, has an agreement on the purchase of arms and military 
equipment from abroad, the Yugoslav Government stresses. 
  That is why a group suspected of preparing an armed uprising 
was arrested in September and October 1993. The group was led 
by Hajzer Hajzeraj, who was declared defense minister, and Ejup 
Dragaj, the so-called deputy defense minister. 
  The objective of the action was to maintain its sovereign 
authority over the entire territory of Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav 
Government stated. 
  Commenting the part of Mazowiecki's report related to the 
rights of ethnic Albanians, Human Rights Federal Minister Margit 
Savovic assessed Monday that the report insists on the 
"mistreatment of Albanians" ignoring their separatist activities. 
  Searches conducted in Albanian houses in Kosovo and Metohija 
are put on the same level as mines planted in Serb houses in 
Croatia, and no mention is made of the large quantities of 
weapons which were discovered by the police during these 
searches, Savovic says.

<F P=106> [Interview with FRY Deputy Prime Minister Zeljko Simic by </F>
Milovan Nedeljkov; place and date not given: "Through 
Negotiations to the Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation 
of Yugoslavia Borders"] 
  [Text] The arrival of FRY Deputy Prime Minister Zeljko 
Simic in Zagreb, announced for 12 February, and Croatian Foreign 
Minister Mate Granic's anticipated return visit to Belgrade were 
logical reasons for an interview with, for the present times, an 
unusual guest. This is a man who came to the position of deputy 
prime minister from the post of special advisor to Slobodan 
Milosevic. According to Belgrade assessments, Simic was one of 
the main strategists for all of Milosevic's moves; he is a man 
who Milosevic trusts very much, and who is expected to soon 
become chief of Yugoslav diplomacy. He is a sociologist, 
educated in England and France. 
  [Nedeljkov] What are your expectations of the trip to 
Zagreb? 
  [Simic] I believe in tolerant talks and equal negotiations, 
and I believe that it is possible to resolve many disputed and 
difficult political issues through talks, so I see no good 
reason for the Croat-Serb issues not to be resolved on these 
methodological principles! I am going to Zagreb with a certain 
amount of realist optimism, because I think that we and the 
highest Croatian officials have found a good political method 
for resolving all the disputed issues. 
  The mere fact that I will come to Zagreb on 12 February, and 
that I am coming without any prejudices, shows that tolerance is 
a dominant trait of Yugoslav politics. 
  [Nedeljkov] You therefore believe in the normalization of 
relations? 
  [Simic] I have no illusions about one trip to Zagreb, or one 
declaration, being able to solve all the issues that are now a 
stumbling block in relations between Zagreb and Belgrade. My 
wish is to show by this visit, which I hope will not only be 
governed by protocol, that there is a willingness in my country 
to normalize relations, that a realistic and rational politics 
is being conducted in the FRY, and that its aim is to solve all 
the problems in a primarily peaceful way and on equal bases. I 
believe that both we in Belgrade and the most prominent 
political figures in Zagreb are aware of the existence of great 
problems, and of the fact that they cannot be solved during one 
visit, but this visit, as well as all the visits that will 
follow, can mark the start of solving the problems that are at 
present in the way of a general normalization of relations 
between Croatia and the FRY. 
  [Nedeljkov] What precisely do you expect will happen in 
Zagreb? 
  [Simic] I hope that there is good will on both sides, and 
during the talks that I have had with the Croatian officials so 
far I received the impression that there is. Moreover, although 
this may sound immodest, all the participants in the recent 
efforts to establish more stable relations between Zagreb and 
Belgrade were given a kind of international acknowledgment, 
primarily that of the International Red Cross, and Mr. K. 
Somaruga saw in our agreement a symbolic, but also pragmatic act 
that, in the foreseeable future, could yield mutually beneficial 
political results. 
  We have simply turned to the specific, existential issues. 
It is more than evident that solving these vital problems can 
have a favorable effect on solving those that are eminently in 
the political sphere. Solving extremely ambitious political 
issues can sometimes slow down the normalization of total 
relations, although I do not deny the possibility of achieving 
such a situation in the near future. To summarize, I would say 
that this "political inversion," so to speak, could be extremely 
fruitful for both sides and for improvedr future relations. 
  [Nedeljkov] Could you be more specific about those "vital 
issues" from which the start would be made? 
  [Simic] For instance, it would include the resolving of the 
issue of missing persons, and all issues regarding the area of 
human rights. Once these issues are resolved, then favorable 
preconditions will be created for resolving the bigger political 
issues, which everyone is familiar with. 
  [Nedeljkov] Does the deputy prime minister of the Federal 
Government know if there are Croatian prisoners in the FRY? 
  [Simic] I can claim that, to my knowledge, and according to 
the knowledge of all the members of the Federal Government, 
there is not a single Croatian citizen in any of the prisons on 
the territory of Yugoslavia. However, I allow that some people 
may be imprisoned on some other basis, perhaps, and if there are 
such cases, we will investigate them and give the Croatian 
authorities the real information. All our prisons are open to 
international institutions, and if there are any indications, 
anyone from Croatia can also visit those prisons, because there 
are no camps or anything of the kind in Yugoslavia. Therefore, 
anyone can come and see for themselves that what I have said is 
true. 
  [Nedeljkov] What follows after solving these cases? 
  [Simic] All the efforts in the normalization of relations 
between the Republic of Croatia and the FRY are aimed at 
avoiding any possibilities and thoughts, let alone a specific 
act, that would lead to war. I believe that the aim is mutual: 
establishing permanent peace on the entire territory of the 
former Yugoslavia, while any other solution would be 
unacceptable both for Croatia and Yugoslavia. 
  [Nedeljkov] The opposition in Croatia and that in Serbia do 
not accept the present agreements on the normalization of 
relations. 
  [Simic] I believe that this criticism is exclusively 
connected to internal political effects, and this is how it 
should be viewed, because the arguments used to dispute our 
efforts make no political sense. If what we are doing and what 
we are resorting to is so fiercely criticized, the alternative 
is aggravating relations and departing from peace. What could 
be the alternative to peace if not war?! 
  [Nedeljkov] How do you see Knin in this context? 
  [Simic] There is a corps of issues, of vital as well as 
political importance, that can be solved directly between Zagreb 
and Belgrade. In my opinion, we can thus pave the way for a 
further normalization of relations, and then, naturally, toward 
the resolving of the most difficult political and other issues. 
However, it is certainly not possible to solve the most vital 
problems without considering all the disputable issues between 
the Serb Krajina and Croatia. The political reality is that 
these disputable issues can only be resolved by the legitimate 
representatives of the Serb people in the Krajina and the 
legitimate Croatian representatives. 
  [Nedeljkov] Is this possible if Milan Martic [president of 
the republic of Serb Krajina] states in VECERNJE NOVOSTI that, 
in the course of this year, all the Serb lands will unite 
(including the Knin Krajina), and that he will then immediately 
hand over his "presidential staff" to Milosevic, who will be the 
president of all Serbs, and the capital will be Belgrade? 
  [Simic] There are many individual statements that, taken out 
of the context, can serve as an alibi for giving up the peace 
efforts. For instance, we could view, rather suspiciously, the 
statement of Mr. G. Susak, the defense minister of Croatia, who 
recently spoke about the relations between Zagreb and Belgrade 
in a rather militant tone. He was speaking an intolerant 
language that anticipated war rather than peace. 
  [Nedeljkov] Let us go back to Mr. Martic's statement. 
  [Simic] I can not speak on behalf of the legitimate 
representatives of the Serb Krajina, nor do I wish to interpret 
their statements, because it is quite natural to ask them about 
something like this. I think that the task of all the prudent 
political forces that bear a certain political weight both in 
the FRY and in Croatia is to find the solution for the 
establishment of democratic forms of political communication, 
and not for the encouragement of the forms that will make the 
relations between the Serb and Croat peoples, which are strained 
as it is, even more difficult. In short, no general conclusions 
should be made on the basis of the statements of any individual 
political figure, but the problems should instead be viewed as a 
whole. Fear and mistrust should be thrown out of these strained 
Croat-Serb relations, which were, until recently, dominated by 
intolerance, and it should be displayed, through specific acts, 
that it is possible to have no conflicts in the relations 
between the two peoples and that such relations are both 
possible and desirable. 
  [Nedeljkov] What is happening with the opening of the 
Croatian Office in Belgrade? 
  [Simic] We have completed all the details, the location has 
been determined, there are no technical obstacles, and I think 
that 15 February is a realistic date for the beginning of the 
activities of the offices both in Belgrade and in Zagreb. 
Naturally, if it is postponed for a day or two it will mean 
nothing significant in the political sense. 
  [Nedeljkov] There is much talk about the Serbs, but almost 
no one mentions the Serbs in Zagreb, Rijeka, Split, Pula.... 
  [Simic] We did not talk about that specifically. However, 
if I go to Zagreb, and I see no reason not to go, I will try to 
get the answer to that question too. However, all this must be 
done in a tolerant tone, and the political forces that support a 
peaceful solution to the Serb-Croat problems should be 
encouraged, both here and there. There are such forces here, 
and I believe they also exist in Croatia. 
  [Nedeljkov] Do the "AVNOJ" [Anti-Fascist Council of National 
Liberation of Yugoslavia] borders stand any chance? 
  [Simic] In my opinion, these borders need not be a stumbling 
block, but a subject of negotiations instead. They are 
extremely ambivalent when it comes to reality. We have come to 
realize that if we talk about the right to self-determination, 
it is the people who create these borders by their own will, and 
not some political power-wielders. However, I believe that this 
issue is so delicate that it should be left for later 
negotiations and talks, and now everything should be done to 
establish relations between Croatia and Yugoslavia on the basis 
of mutual trust, and to mark them with maximum tolerance on both 
sides. It would perhaps be fatal if we were to raise these 
issues, which are the most delicate, first. However, if we start 
from smaller, but vital ones, and if both sides realize that 
there is mutual good will, these most delicate issues could soon 
be on the agenda too. 
  [Nedeljkov] Will this year be the crucial one in Croat-Serb 
relations? 
  [Simic] Yes, though it could perhaps sooner be said to be a 
turning point, but only in the sense that real negotiations and 
agreements should start. It would be illusory to expect the 
issues that partly concern the past to be solved overnight. The 
most important thing is that the opinions and forces see a way 
to solve relations between the two countries only through 
negotiations prevail on both sides. 
  [Nedeljkov] Are you saying that you are going to Zagreb with 
a peace offer? 
  [Simic] Yes, that is the way to say it. We are prepared for 
dialogue, and we see tolerant communication as the only possible 
way to resolve the problem. I speak on behalf of those 
political forces in Serbia and the FRY that are dominant. The 
wounds are heavy on both sides, and I am not saying it is easy 
to forget everything, but we have to start going the peaceful 
way. 
  [Nedeljkov] Were the problems of the Croats in Vojvodina 
mentioned in the talks with the Croatian delegation? 
  [Simic] Not at all, but that does not mean there will be no 
discussion of that.

<F P=106> [Article by Verica Rudar: "What Is Ljubljana's Message for </F>
Belgrade?"] 
  [Text] In the view of Yugoslav diplomats, the 
normalization of relations between Slovenia and the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia will certainly be a strenuous and 
long-term project. Although the establishment of communications 
between Ljubljana and Belgrade would be very important for the 
situation in the former Yugoslavia in general, the chances that 
this could happen soon are minimal. 
  A signal that relations between Yugoslavia and Slovenia 
might 
be reconsidered came this time from the Slovene capital. 
According to information published in the Yugoslav newspapers, 
the Slovene Government could be addressing this issue soon. The 
establishing of relations between the two states, the exchange 
of diplomatic representatives, and the abolition of the visa 
requirement for Yugoslav citizens are some of the topics to be 
considered. This information has not been denied and, apart 
from that, it is the logical conclusion to a series of 
statements issued by Slovene politicians, which pointed to a 
change in relations toward Belgrade. 
  The announcement about the normalization of relations were 
also supported by information that an official Slovene 
delegation had arrived in Belgrade for this purpose, but it was 
stated that the details cannot yet be published since the matter 
is very delicate. 
  The FRY Ministry of Foreign Affairs is denying that any 
official Slovene delegation came to Belgrade. It is stated that 
this is rather a visit of businessmen, since these contacts have 
not been interrupted. It is assumed in the Federal Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs that Slovene businessmen might even be checking 
the atmosphere for possible political contacts, but there have 
been no official statements about it. 
<H5>  Commercial contacts </H5>
  The signals from the Slovene side are being received in 
Yugoslavia with reservations. One could even say with distrust. 
  Yugoslav diplomats point out that Yugoslavia has not been 
officially recognized by Slovenia. It is also true that 
Slovenia does not accept Yugoslavia on the international scene. 
Yugoslav sources claim that Slovenia is becoming increasingly 
isolated because of its extreme policy toward Yugoslavia, so 
that this might be one of the reasons why it has decided to 
"soften" its attitudes toward Yugoslavia. 
  Official Belgrade has not forgotten "the extremist, 
anti-Serbian statements issued by Milan Kucan in Albania" or the 
moves made by Slovene statesmen who "instead of soothing the 
passions, stirred them up, always to Serbia's disadvantage." 
  After reporters remarked that this relatively negative 
attitude might negate the unofficial signal from Ljubljana, a 
Yugoslav diplomat said: "We do not think that there is only one 
opinion in Slovenia about Yugoslavia. Slovenia is the former 
Yugoslav republic that made the greatest effort to harm the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. I am now speaking about the 
official Slovene attitude, not about the attitudes of all the 
politicians, and especially not about the attitudes of the 
Slovene people." Yugoslav diplomats have the impression that 
there are differences between Milan Kucan, the president of 
Slovenia, Lojze Peterle, the minister of foreign affairs, and 
Janez Drnovsek, the prime minister, the last being "sober, 
realistic and trustworthy." 
  The first signs of a change in the Slovene attitude toward 
Yugoslavia were noticed during the visit of Karolos Papoulias, 
the Greek foreign minister, and Vaclav Havel, the Czech 
president, to Slovenia, in November 1993. 
<H5>  Diplomatic Pirouettes </H5>
  At that time the press carried statements made by Milan 
Kucan 
and Lojze Peterle that unquestionably represented a shift in 
policy toward Belgrade. Kucan said that "Slovenia never had any 
conflict with Serbia," and Peterle that "Slovenia would be happy 
if the conditions for the removal of the sanctions against 
Serbia and Montenegro were fulfilled." 
  At the beginning of December 1993, Mr. Peterle, the Slovene 
minister of foreign affairs, made that attitude concrete in a 
letter to Warren Christopher, the U.S. secretary of state, in 
which he wrote: "A possible removal of the sanctions against 
Yugoslavia is being fully considered since the aims for which 
they were introduced have not been achieved.... The European 
Union initiative makes us hope that the situation in the Balkans 
can be solved." 
  In the view of Slovene political commentators, the softening 
of the Slovene attitude toward the FRY is a part of the 
diplomatic tactics the aim of which is to adapt Slovene policy 
to the policy of the European Union, with which Slovenia is 
awaiting negotiations about associate membership. Belgrade 
diplomats agree with this assessment and claim that the first 
announcement of possible contacts between Yugoslavia and 
Slovenia were made by arrangement with Germany and Austria. 
  In the focus of Serbian attention now are relations with 
Croatia, and as far as Slovenia is concerned, the official 
proposal for the normalization of relations has to be specified 
first. Single statements and "diplomatic pirouettes" are not 
enough to overcome the present differences, including the 
Slovene attitude toward Kosovo, the interruption of economic 
relations, the way Slovene independence was achieved by force, 
and diplomatic duels on the international scene.

<H5>  Jovanovic: "Slovenia Must Excuse Itself" </H5>
  "In order to enter the process of normalization of relations 
with Slovenia, certain conditions must be fulfilled first," 
Vladislav Jovanovic, FRY minister of foreign affairs, said in a 
statement for POLITIKA, and added: "First it is necessary for 
Slovenia to excuse itself for the rude and impertinent move it 
made a year ago in refusing the Yugoslav offer of recognizing 
Slovenia. It is further necessary that the anti-Serbian 
campaign that Slovenia has been spreading all over the world is 
ended and that it acknowledges that those who remained in 
Yugoslavia have the right to self- determination. Apart from 
that, Slovenia must stop challenging the continuity of 
Yugoslavia as a state. 
  Slovenia made a mistake by insisting that the FRY be 
excluded 
from all international forums. In addition, Slovenia supports 
the lifting of the arms embargo on the Bosnia- Herzegovina 
Muslims. There are many situations that prove that Slovenia has 
a hostile attitude toward Yugoslavia. We are not bothered that 
Slovenia is an independent state. On the contrary, while we 
lived together, we had excellent relations. That is why our 
surprise was great when the turnaround occurred. 
  Yugoslavia is interested in good relations with all of its 
neighbors -- old and new alike. Slovenia is no exception. We 
cannot account for the hostility that they have shown toward 
Yugoslavia and toward the people who are living in this region 
now. Official Slovenia should find ways and means to end this 
hostility. We are, of course, interested in normal relations 
between Slovenia and Yugoslavia, but some prerequisites have to 
be fulfilled," Jovanovic concluded his statement.

<F P=106> [Radovan Kovacevic and Radovan Pavlovic article: "A Mortar </F>
Could Have Not Caused Such a Tragedy"] 
  [Text] The massacre that took place at a Sarajevo market 
was not the work of an insane mind but of a cool and calculated 
criminal who is exceptionally knowledgeable about combat 
techniques. This was stated by Colonel Milan Rundic, a 
long-serving member of the research team at the 
Military-Technical Institute. He has been carefully analyzing 
the horrific effects of the explosion. He intends to inform the 
public and experts of his conclusions. 
  "I claim that such a destructive effect could have not been 
caused by any bomb fired from our mortars, regardless of their 
caliber," he said. 
  "According to the information to which I have had access, I 
think that this was an antipersonnel mine that produces a 
circular, splinter effect [kruzno parcadno dejstvo]. This mine 
was developed in our institute, but has never become part of the 
Yugoslav People's Army's equipment. 
  "The final development stage of this mine, which was carried 
out in total secrecy, was entrusted to the Slavko Rodic military 
factory in Bugojno. The head of the team there was Isak Asim. 
Bugojno is predominantly a Muslim town, in which the accounts 
with the Serbs had been settled quickly, and then with the 
Croats. The factory has been bombed, but, judging by 
everything, production was quickly resumed according to the 
blueprints, which survived, and the highly developed 
technology...." 
  The mine that Colonel Rundic claims was used in Sarajevo was 
certainly much more powerful than those that appeared in the 
naught series [nultna serija] in Bugojno, but, as he stresses, 
what was important in the production of this explosive device 
was its operating principle. 
<H5>  Balls and Plastic Explosive </H5>
  He drew a picture depicting a plastic cylinder, filled with 
up to 5,000 small metal balls 4-5 mm in diameter. The explosion 
is initiated from inside in such a way that it simultaneously 
triggers plastic explosive at the top and the bottom of the 
cylinder. The two detonation waves thus caused drive the balls 
with immense force toward the middle, and are then released 
horizontally at incredible speeds. The spread is deadly and 
does not scatter itself, but in fact kills anything within a 
60-80 meter radius. 
  Colonel Rundic refutes the report, that is, the hypothesis 
of 
AFP, that the mortar hit a market stall and exploded in a 
relatively confined area, resulting in what is claimed to be the 
"world record" in this kind of killing. Our interviewee 
rejected this. Only a mine with a circular effect, judging by 
the traces and other details, could have killed so many people. 
  The mine was brought to the market by someone. Considering 
its small dimensions and can-like shape (like a can of beans), 
it was planted in a certain place in advance. The mine has a 
fuse that can be set to activate the mine at any time from five 
minutes to several days.... The list of suspects excludes the 
Serbs, because they are in Grbavica. In reply to the question 
why such a large number of people were there at that time, the 
colonel said that he was not an expert on that, but that one 
should investigate whether anyone had started distributing food 
at that spot unannounced at the very time when the detonator was 
activated. 
  Replying to why anyone in the Muslim part of Sarajevo would 
want to kill people in such a cruel way, Colonel Rundic asked: 
"Did not something similar happen in Vaso Miskina Street [where 
a Serbian shell killed civilians in a bread queue]?" 

<H5>    Why Is the Market Intact? </H5>
  Other experts of the Yugoslav Army also claim that it was 
impossible for one 120-mm mortar to kill 68 and wound nearly 200 
people, as stated by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] the day 
before yesterday. 
  An artillery expert in the General Staff of the Yugoslav 
Army 
told us yesterday that all analyses show that one bomb could 
have not caused such a large number of casualties, and that it 
was probably an improvised, remote-controlled, explosive device 
planted at the Merkale market. 
  The anonymous colonel from the Artillery Department of the 
General Staff of the Yugoslav Army said that the tragedy in the 
Sarajevo market was caused by an improvised mine, the so-called 
camouflet [fugasa], and that it could have not been a projectile 
fired from a mortar or any other artillery piece. 
  This deadly mine can be "made" very easily: Plastic 
explosive of destructive power could be put into a sack of 
potatoes or some other market commodity, reinforced with steel 
pellets, placed under a market stall, and then detonated. Only 
such a device or something similar could have caused such a 
large number of tragic casualties. 
  However, to avoid speculations and guessing, everything 
could 
be precisely established with an investigation and autopsies of 
the bodies of those killed, which must have contained fragments 
of the projectile. 
  What artillery experts unequivocally claim is that this 
tragedy was not caused by a mortar. Judging by what the 
television pictures have shown so far (information about the 
tragedy is certainly selective and strictly censored), a similar 
effect could be caused by six to nine mortar bombs. If this 
were the case, the Sarajevo market would have been almost 
destroyed. The reports on the tragedy have so far mentioned 
only one bomb. The public was shown only a small crater. 
  Our interviewee said that the effect of mortars is not so 
devastating if people are in a group, as was the case at the 
market when people were waiting for the distribution of 
humanitarian aid. "Every person in the group acts as a kind of 
shelter to another person, because shrapnel does not travel 
through a human body as bullets do," the colonel from the 
General Staff of the Yugoslav Army said. 
  However, such a number of people could have been killed by 
several bombs of a higher caliber, such as 120-mm, 160-mm, and 
240-mm (none of the sides in the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
uses the last of these), but these bombs would have to explode 
simultaneously and would certainly destroy a good part of the 
market. 
  The origin and type of explosive in the bomb could be 
established precisely, if it was fired at all, because traces of 
artillery fragments would remain on the concrete ground. 
Craters show a real "picture" for experienced artillery 
experts. On the basis of craters they can determine who fired a 
shell and from what weapon, the military expert said.

<F P=106> ["D.B."-signed report: "Veljko Dzakula Kidnapped"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Belgrade -- According to the statement issued 
by the Citizens Alliance of Serbia, Veljko Dzakula, former 
official in the government of the republic of Serbian Krajina, 
was kidnapped yesterday by unidentified people in front of the 
Yugoslav Drama Theater. Dzakula, who had appeared on NTV Studio 
B [independent television station] two nights ago, was kidnapped 
by "three skinheads." 
  In the statement for BORBA, Vesna Pesic, chairman of the 
Citizens Alliance of Serbia and a deputy in the Serbian 
Assembly, said that she immediately sent a telegram concerning 
this incident to Minister Zoran Sokolovic and President 
Milosevic. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Imprisoned for Negotiating </H5>
  Veljko Dzakula, an engineer and former vice president of the 
Republic of Serbian Krajina; Dusan Ecimovic, former information 
minister; and adviser Mladen Kulic were in prison until 21 
September last year -- first in Knin and then in Glina -- for 
signing an 11-point agreement with Ivan Milas, leader of the 
Croatian delegation, after the meeting on 18 February in the 
village of Doljani near Daruvar. 
  "To sign a secret agreement in times of war is an act of 
treason," Goran Hadzic, then president of the republic of 
Serbian Krajina said, while Dzakula claimed that he had "the 
authority to negotiate, since the talks with Croatia concerned 
local problems -- reconstruction of the infrastructure, delivery 
of water, electricity..." The interesting thing is that the 
other three members from the negotiating team not only avoided 
any blame (and prison) but also remained at their posts in the 
government of the republic of Serbian Krajina.

<F P=106> [Vesna Vujic commentary: "The Democrats After `Muscle </F>
Building'"] 
  [Text] Professor Dragoljub Micunovic, the undisputed 
leader of the Democratic Party [DS] for four years and one of 
the most prominent figures of the Serbian opposition, has left 
the front line of the Serbian political scene. His departure 
marks the end of a kind of politics of the center, and an 
attempt at a compromise that was not successful, measured by the 
number of deputies. It seems that in times of ultra extreme 
left and extreme right political programs it could not be. 
  When he submitted his irrevocable resignation, Micunovic 
told 
the deputies at the DS convention that he wanted to spare them 
the embarrassment of replacing a man of whom they could not 
prove the least stigma of guilt. In fact he could not have had 
such a scar, as in principle he has consistently implemented his 
party's policy -- somewhere in the middle. After the 1992 
elections, it became clear for the first time that the fact that 
the DS gained only seven seats in parliament was 
disproportionate to the great investment in the party. Thus, 
even then, some communal party committees called for a change in 
the party leadership and even in the policy of the DS. 
Micunovic, and even Dr. Zoran Djindjic, chairman of the 
Executive Committee of the DS, did not think the time was ripe. 
<H5>  Policy of Compromise </H5>
  Then last autumn Djindjic judged that the time was ripe and 
he set off almost unstoppably on the quest for the top post in 
the party and the top of Serbian politics. Although Micunovic 
had recently been speaking out as a fierce oppositionist and had 
been demonstrating the high standard of his rhetorical talent, 
it was already too late. Along with him, all philosophers in 
the DS as well as in Serbian politics have lost the battle. 
Micunovic is the embodiment of sublime political contemplation, 
as well as of political activity that is not in coordination 
with that contemplation. 
  Djindjic has come to the top because, having stepped out of 
Micunovic's shadow, he began to give the impression of being an 
extremely practical man who knows what he wants and how to get 
it. This does not necessarily mean, however, a change in DS 
policy. In fact, he openly says that there will be no changes 
in the program but there will be changes in action. With the 
change at the top, the DS appears to be the same creature, but 
after a course of vigorous "muscle building." Djindjic has 
confirmed this by saying: "We are a party that has lost fat and 
gained muscles." 
  In leaving, Micunovic certainly took with him the former 
policy of compromise, particularly regarding the Socialist Party 
of Serbia. The question remains of what Djindjic will do now. 
In this respect, other opposition parties do not consider 
Djindjic any less suspicious than Micunovic. At the end 
Micunovic himself accused Djindjic of colluding with the 
Socialists. 
  As the main evidence of this one usually cites Djindjic's 
sudden haste in replacing the former leader of the Democrats, 
who did not have even a full year left to go to the end of his 
term. Nobody was in any doubt that Djindjic would naturally be 
the head of the party after that. Moreover, long before the 
denouement in the DS leadership even started, Dr. Vojislav 
Seselj, who was still close to the Socialists at the time, 
announced Micunovic's replacement. It is also a fact that 
during his election campaign, Djindjic said that Milosevic 
should not be attacked. What is more, the Democrats have no 
interest at all in parliamentary posts, but are definitely 
interested in all talks about a government of national unity. 
<H5>  Airing of the Opposition </H5>
  Djindjic considers the accusations of cooperating with the 
Socialist Party of Serbia to be the greatest slander. Regarding 
the change in party policy, he says he called for it because 
there was a danger of the party losing the entire political 
capital it had built up and of being left without a single seat 
following some future elections. Secondly, he asks why he would 
want any posts in the fourth Socialist government when he has 
shown no interest in the previous ones. "I am not that 
politically naive and stupid," the new leader of the Democrats 
says. 
  Djindjic's sense of pragmatism -- something that, without 
exception, everybody grants him -- will direct his strategy and 
thereby the behavior of the DS. Namely, the Democrats proceed 
from the fact that a system can be destroyed only from within, 
so that the party's possible participation in the government 
would not be such a great surprise. Djindjic does not conceal 
the fact that his aim is not to get the votes of the opposition, 
but the votes of the Socialists, as well as of the undecided. 
He says very self- confidently that his next aim is 50 seats in 
parliament. 
  His policy is also to ingratiate himself with the 
Socialists, 
something that at one time the Radicals were successful at. It 
is clear that following the December elections, the electorate 
is becoming more stable and there is less inclination toward the 
extremists. With a new man the Democrats will try to occupy as 
much space as possible in the political center. That is why it 
is not surprising that the change at the top took place in the 
party that is the embodiment of such a policy of the center. 
With the power of the Socialists reduced, the opposition can 
breathe a little more easily. Therefore, Micunovic's departure 
may herald the airing on a bigger or smaller scale -- the 
appearance of new ideas and new people -- in other opposition 
parties as well.

<F P=106> ["B.I.M."-attributed report: "Seselj Threatens Muslims and </F>
Montenegrins"] 
  [Text] Podgorica -- "Where are those who threatened me not 
to come to Montenegro?" Dr. Vojislav Seselj asked the members of 
the Serbian Radical Party [SRS] and its sympathizers, who 
gathered to hail their leader on Saturday evening. To support 
his claim that there are no obstacles for him in "Serbian 
Montenegro," the leader of the Serbian Radicals quoted his visit 
to Plav, which is mainly inhabited by Muslims. "I strolled 
through Plav yesterday, and nobody dared utter a word," boasted 
Seselj who was received in the Budo Tomovic youth hall in 
Podgorica with chants Serbia! Serbia! and well-known Chetnik 
songs (Who is the second, I am the first to drink Turkish blood). 
  Seselj spoke mostly about the progress that has been made in 
the creation of a greater Serbia, calling on the Muslims and the 
Croats in the Republic of Croatia to "accept the peace on the 
front lines as this is the most fair. If they do not want this, 
the Serbs will conquer even those territories that they lost 
because of the betrayal by the former Yugoslav Peoples' Army." 
For this reason, the Serbs have lost Dubrovnik, Zadar, Sibenik, 
Karlovac, Virovitica, and Osijek ("all Serbian towns"), however, 
"one must be realistic" now and form a unified Serbian state 
with one parliament and one president on the territories that 
the Serbs "have managed to liberate." 
  "The SRS is a sword hanging over the heads of enemies of the 
Serbs," Seselj stated and added that "the Muslims in Sandzak are 
preparing for an uprising," however "let them, as several tens 
of thousands of SRS members and the Serbian Chetnik movement 
members are ready to go to these territories at any moment to 
prevent the fragmentation of the Serbian lands." The revenge 
will be bloody and there will be no mercy, Seselj added. 
  Dr. Seselj also reviewed the efforts of individual 
Montenegrin parties (the Liberal Alliance of Montenegro and the 
Social Democratic Party) to separate Montenegro from the Serbian 
lands, which he described as "the betrayal of Serbianhood by 
foreign mercenaries," who would not have entered the Assembly 
had the Albanians, the Muslims and the Catholics in Boka 
Kotorska not voted for them.

<F P=106> [Milan Laketic commentary: "Fictitious Conflicts in </F>
Fictitious Republic"] 
  [Text] Pristina, 4 February -- "Only the peasants resisted 
the tremors" -- under this headline, ZERI, a newspaper that 
comes out in the Albanian language in Pristina, presents the 
chronology of the conflicts on the political scene in the 
fictitious republic of Kosovo. However, even though the 
republic does not exist, the conflicts among its political 
leaders are real enough. 
  Although Shkelzen Maliqi, one of the pioneers of party 
pluralism in Kosovo, says in ZERI that the rift among the 
Albanian leaders should not be written about, the Albanian press 
keeps exploiting this topic to the full. According to ZERI, the 
surprise came when Jusuf Buxhovi, one of the founders of the 
Democratic League of Kosovo [LDK], was removed from that party. 
That triggered off a series of political clashes in the most 
populous and influential Albanian party in the Balkans. 
  The LDK members are wondering what Anton Kolaj, member of 
that party's presidency, is doing in the United States while 
they, as they say, are here fighting the Serbian authorities. 
The explanation that Anton Kolaj is in the United States to 
form a branch of the party does not sound convincing enough, 
particularly as the party and Kolaj are only interested in the 
money of Albanian guest workers in the United States. 
  According to ZERI, the conflict started in the Parliamentary 
Party of Kosovo, when "the entire leadership was removed" from 
the party. This was, by the way, a party of young people. 
There has also been a rift in the Christian Democratic Party. 
Lazer Krasniqi, its leader, is now in Zagreb, according to 
ZERI, and academician Mark Krasniqi is now the leader of the 
party. Those with a good knowledge of the political trends in 
Kosovo and Metohija have from the start doubted that this party 
had a future, since most of its members are Albanians of the 
Muslim faith, so this must be the only Christian Democratic 
Party in the world whose members are predominantly Muslim. 
  There have also been rifts in UNICOMB (the Party of National 
Unity) since its chairman Halit Alildemaj left. He is now in 
Tirana. Skelzen Maliqi and Kacusa Jashari have left the 
leadership of the Social Democratic Party. 
  According to BUJKU, there have also been rifts between "the 
president of the republic and the government of Kosovo." 
BUJKU's commentator wonders whether it is true that there has 
also been a rift among the ranks of the LDK and Bukoshi's 
government. 
  Academician Rexhep Qosja told the press about the cause of 
the rift: 
  "The problem is double-edged -- because of the prestige and 
the money that Bukoshi is gathering diligently while Rugova 
wants to spend it without any controls." 
  Adem Demaci, chairman of the Commission for Human Rights and 
the director of the weekly FORUM, was more open in presenting 
the real picture. He sent out an appeal to his fellow-citizens 
"not to pay 30 percent of their income in tax to a republic that 
is not recognized by anyone. The chances are that they, Edita 
Tahiri and Anton Kolaj, are spending that money in the United 
States." Demaci also said that many leaders use the money from 
that fund to educate their children abroad, while the Albanians 
in Kosovo can barely make ends meet. 
  Following these individual clashes, the supporters of 
Rugova's option are now faced by an official opposition. At the 
recent gathering of Albanian parties in Tetovo -- which was not 
attended by the representatives of Rugova's LDK -- the so-called 
democratic bloc was formed. Mahmut Bakalli, who hitherto used 
to communicate exclusively in the Ankara-Pristina-Bonn-United 
States direction -- made his first public appearance in Tetovo.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Belgrade Television RTB Network in 
Serbo-Croatian dedicates its 8 February edition of the 
"Aktuelnosti" current affairs program, broadcast at 1938 GMT, to 
the explosion that killed 68 and injured 200 people at a 
Sarajevo market on 5 February. The anchor man in the Belgrade 
Television studio is Milorad Komrakov. 
  He is joined by the following guests: Captain 1st Class 
Dusan Jelusic, Yugoslav Army expert on mortar ammunition; 
Lieutenant Zoran Stankovic, Yugoslav Army pathology expert; 
military commentator Petar Knezevic; and machine engineer 
Colonel Milan Rundic, explosives expert. 
  Radovan Karadzic, president of the republic of Srpska, and 
General Major Milan Gvero, assistant commander of the General 
Staff of the Army of the republic of Srpska, join in the program 
live from the Pale television studio. 
  At the beginning the program replays the footage of the 
Sarajevo massacre, which is followed by reportage rounding up 
all major massacres that have taken place in Sarajevo from the 
beginning of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Komrakov then asks Radovan Karadzic to explain the contents 
of his letter to U.S. President Clinton and Russian President 
Yeltsin in which he claims that "a great and feeble deception 
took place at the Sarajevo market" as well as the findings on 
which he bases his conclusions. Karadzic replies: 
  "We base such conclusions on the findings that we are mostly 
receiving from the Croatian side in Sarajevo, on the analyses of 
our experts, on simple examination of the footage taken by the 
Muslim side, and on statements given by the Muslim listeners to 
Radio Hayatt, which are recorded and undisputable. Namely, if 
one looks carefully at the footage, one sees clearly that there 
are very few goods on the market and that very few market stalls 
have goods. One must try to imagine that in such a small place 
at least 300 people were caught in this explosion, and it must 
be assumed that there might have been another 300 who were not 
effected. Therefore, it is absolutely impossible to imagine and 
justify the presence of some 300 to 600 people in such a poor 
market. Furthermore, we have some reports from the Muslim side, 
which I hope we will be able to hear tonight, that no noise 
characteristic of a mortar bomb was heard, and the Muslim 
witnesses have also said so. There have been some reports that 
there were not many people there at all. We have reports, and 
this can also be concluded from this television footage, that 
the bodies of people who had died much earlier were also used. 
Now we can see on the film something that resembles a stuffed 
mannequin, plastic or made of fabric. There are also 
indications of plastic mannequins. 
  "In short, an enormous deception has taken place. Something 
tragic happened at that market, that is for sure. However, 
whether so many people died, whether the bomb arrived from 
elsewhere, or whether an explosive device exploded on the site, 
all this gives rise to great suspicion. Furthermore, it can be 
clearly concluded that this was stage-managed -- just look how 
much this resembles a mannequin -- and that these were 
concoctions that should shock the world, that is to say, turn 
the world against us." 
  Karadzic also says that "the Muslim side has rejected any 
sort of joint investigation by a joint commission, that is to 
say, any sort of international investigation." "We demanded 
that Russia and the United States not to allow their policies to 
be ruled by such a fake," Karadzic says, "and we demanded an 
international expert examination of this and any other case." 
"The fate of the nation and the fate of peace in the region is 
at stake," he exclaims, "and not a single serious country in the 
world should allow itself to rely on the Muslim sources alone." 
  The program then broadcasts a roundup report on ways in 
which 
foreign media have reported on the same event. 
  Afterward Komrakov asks Karadzic to comment on the "warning 
to the Bosnian Serbs to remove the artillery positioned around 
Sarajevo or face the risk of NATO air strikes," and the 
statements by "U.S. and Russian representatives." 
  Karadzic replies that "Russia has a balanced and correct 
attitude toward the crisis." "It is clear," he goes on, "that 
any sort of involvement in a civil war would really mean the 
proliferation of the war and would be completely unjustified. 
Anyone who would attack us would become our enemy and our 
attitude toward the enemy would, naturally, be defined on the 
basis of a natural right of any nation to defend itself. 
Unfortunately, in the United States many circles are completely 
uninformed. Sarajevo is not surrounded, it is a divided town. 
We have a part of Sarajevo that we will not give to anyone. We 
are willing to negotiate on how much of Sarajevo will be Serbian 
and how much Muslim. However, the idea of abandoning a town 
populated by 200,000 Serbs is out of the question. We can 
agree, within a peace plan and possibly under the UN 
administration of Sarajevo, to reduce and remove our artillery. 
However, how far do they think we should move artillery when 
artillery has various ranges? We will not move our artillery 
out of the borders of our republic." 
  Speaking further about the attitude of the international 
community toward the Bosnian Serbs, Karadzic says: "We are 
absolutely sure that governments and their secret services know 
the truth. They have known it since the very beginning when 
they started destroying Yugoslavia." According to him, "they 
knew that a war would break out in Bosnia-Herzegovina and did 
not hurry with this war until the war in Croatia had ended." 
"They planned to finish with Bosnia by the end of May 1992, 
when it would have been Kosovo's turn, perhaps even that of 
Sandzak and Vojvodina. However, their scenario was thwarted, 
because the Serbs in Bosnia held out much longer than 
anticipated." 
  "The governments that know the real truth," Karadzic 
continues, "the governments that make decisions, will opt for 
peace at a moment when the advantages of a war will disappear." 
He goes on to say that "one can already see that numerous 
European countries that used to favor war no longer favor it, 
that is, the war has started to cause damage to them. When this 
will also be the case with Germany and the United States, peace 
will come very quickly. Namely, it is clear that the Muslim 
leadership listens obediently to its patrons and masters." 
  "The fact is," Karadzic remarks, "that the United States 
managed to compromise and upset Europe to the utmost with 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. I still do not see any readiness on their 
part to drop the possibility of arbitrating in the region and, 
perhaps, strengthening their presence in the region, on the 
assumption that Russia will recover some day and there will be a 
need to monitor it from close up." 
  General Gvero is then asked to comment on the 5 February 
massacre. "We know our units and what orders they have," he 
says, "and they obey our orders. We are sure that, on that 
date, there were no activities, just as during a period prior to 
that, against the part of Sarajevo controlled by the Muslims." 
  As he says, for this reason, the Serbian side proposed the 
formation of a "mixed, neutral commission" immediately after the 
explosion. "Speaking of the truth, we know the truth as well as 
all the people of good intentions. The truth is that a Serbian 
hand did not do this and this is a criminal fabrication of an 
event," Gvero assures. 
  When Gvero was asked about the alleged evidence held by the 
Bosnian Serbs that "a foreign intelligence service was directly 
involved" in the planning of this massacre, as well as "a group 
of Muslims from the former Bosnia-Herzegovina active in the 
Islamic lobby in the United States," Gvero replies that the 
Serbian side has been monitoring very carefully everything that 
was happening "before and after this event." He confirms that 
they "hold certain information of various origins, which is in 
the process of being checked." Gvero reminds that a Turkish 
official at the beginning of January announced that "something 
that will make the world speechless" will happen in Sarajevo, 
which he finds indicative. However, as he says, "until we hold 
firmer, more definitive proof that can be verified, we would not 
like to make public statements." He says that this massacre 
must be "thoroughly investigated" to prevent similar such events 
happening in the future. 
  At the end, Karadzic says that "the international community 
must soon change its attitude toward the warring sides. Their 
attitude must be perfectly balanced. They must lift the 
sanctions against the Serbs for the Muslims to realize that this 
game is over and sign the peace plan. If the international 
community really wants to proliferate and intensify the 
conflict, then it will believe the Muslim fabrication, or some 
country will order it." 
  Komrakov here thanks Karadzic, who must leave the studio due 
to "pressing duties," for his participation in the program. 
  After Karadzic leaves Studio Pale, the program returns to 
Studio Belgrade, where studio announcer Milorad Komrakov begins 
interviewing his guests. 
  First, Komrakov turns to 1st Class Captain Dusan Jelusic, an 
expert on mortars in the Yugoslav Army, and asks him to give his 
expert opinion. Jelusic says that it is impossible for a mortar 
shell to disintegrate into so much shrapnel, yet not damage any 
of the market stalls. 
  After Jelusic, Komrakov turns to explosives expert Milan 
Rundic, who proceeds to give vital statistics of a type of mine 
that could have been used, but says that even if the mine or 
shell had exploded under ideal conditions, it could not have 
caused as many casualties. He then proceeds to give a lot of 
scientific details and to explain the diagram he has drawn of 
how the shrapnel disperses after the initial detonation. 
  Komrakov then introduces archive footage of site of massacre 
shot by an unidentified foreign television crew, which shows a 
man, allegedly a Bosnian official, who is taking measurements. 
When asked to explain what he is doing, he answers that he is 
investigating and cannot give any more details. Following this, 
Komrakov introduces an excerpt from a phone-in program of Radio 
Hayat. In the program, listeners phone in and urge citizens to 
take up arms and advocate the killing of all Serbs. Some also 
advocate killing all the Croats in addition to the Serbs. Only 
one listener says that it is not normal to call for such 
violence. 
  Following this, Komrakov turns to military-political 
commentator Petar Knezevic, who says that the 5 February 
massacre was evidently a terrorist act. Asked to assess the 
seriousness of air strikes, Knezevic says that air strikes would 
not give the desired results and that in his opinion, the allies 
will not go ahead with their threats. 
  Komrakov now turns to Dr. Zoran Stanojevic, army forensic 
pathologist, and asks him to assess the investigation carried 
out at the site. Stanojevic says that in order get real 
results, the investigators should not concentrate as much on the 
site of the explosion but rather on the bodies of the deceased. 
He maintains that no proper autopsies were performed and that 
the time of death was not established. Otherwise, claims 
Stanojevic, had proper autopsies been carried out, it would have 
been established that some of the bodies had been dead for some 
time before they were brought over to the market. He offers to 
take his team and go to Sarajevo to perform the autopsies in the 
presence of experts from all sides involved. 
  After this, Komrakov thanks his guests and reads a TANJUG 
report that arrived in the editorial room some time earlier, 
which says that the shell that landed on Markale market was 
launched from Bosnian Army positions some 2 km away. With this, 
he thanks the viewers for watching the program and wishes them 
goodnight.

  [Text] In a letter today Radovan Karadzic, president of 
the republic of Srpska, informed U.S. and Russian Presidents 
Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin that a great and feeble deception 
took place at the Sarajevo market. Accepting full 
responsibility for every word in the letter, Karadzic emphasizes 
that an explosion in which few people were killed and injured 
took place at the market, while everything else surrounding this 
incident was stage-managed. 
  There were very few goods in the market, and those were in 
only a few stalls. Eyewitnesses did not observe over 300 people 
at the market directly prior to the explosion, but only a 
handful. It would not even be logical for more than 300 people 
to be present at a small market that was lacking in goods. 
  Karadzic also pointed to a very indicative fact: The Muslim 
side rejected an investigation that would be carried out by the 
UN experts with the participation of Serbian and Muslim experts. 
Interviews with survivors, as well as pathological findings on 
the causes and times of deaths, would have revealed the entire 
fake. Namely, all the witnesses, even the Muslims in the Muslim 
media, have stated that this was an unusual bomb because the 
characteristic whistling noise was not heard prior to the 
explosion. 
  Karadzic, among other things, warns that the television 
footage clearly shows that manipulation with bodies has taken 
place in this tragedy. As he says, in the footage one can see 
the bodies of casualties who had died hours earlier as well as 
plastic body parts. We must not allow, Karadzic says, that one 
warring side would deceive the entire international community, 
including the most important forces -- the United States and 
Russia, and their presidents -- and lead them to false 
conclusions. This is a great shame, he says. 
  Karadzic appealed to Clinton and Yeltsin: We beg you to 
discover the real truth by all means available to your powerful 
countries.

  [Text] Belgrade, 9 Feb (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic, 
president of the Srpska republic, today sent a letter to Vitaliy 
Churkin, deputy minister for foreign affairs of the Russian 
Federation. In the letter he points out that the Serb side 
"cannot tolerate a situation in which the perpetrator of the 
crime in Sarajevo's marketplace remains unidentified. Nor can 
it tolerate the international community's tacit agreement that 
this was done by the Serbs." 
  "If the truth is not established promptly the Muslim side 
will continue to perpetrate crimes to fool the international 
community while the Serbian people and the whole region will 
experience an escalation and intensification of war," Radovan 
Karadzic cautions in his letter. 
  The president of the Srpska republic demands that the 
Russian 
Government provide a neutral international group of experts to 
compile a professional report. This team of experts should also 
include, in addition to ballistics specialists, pathologists who 
would investigate the causes and time of death of the civilian 
victims. 
  Radovan Karadzic maintains that in the course of identifying 
the true perpetrator of the massacre in Merkale marketplace one 
should also analyze it politically, something President Yeltsin 
has mentioned too. This analysis, Karadzic believes, would 
indicate which side has made a political gain from this crime. 
  "We call on you and the Russian Government to provide such 
an 
expert report and appoint Russian ballistics experts, 
pathologists, and political analysts to such an international 
group of experts. It goes without saying that this group should 
also include experts from the Serbian and Muslim side," Karadzic 
writes in his letter to Churkin.

  [Excerpt] Sarajevo, 8 Feb (TANJUG) -- The shell that caused 
the tragedy in Sarajevo's Markale market was fired from a 
position 2 km northeast of the scene of the carnage. The shell 
was lobbed from 1-1.5 km within the territory under the control 
of Muslim forces, in relation to the separation line with the 
Army of the republic of Srpska. 
  This was confirmed to a TANJUG correspondent this evening by 
very reliable and confidential sources in the UN Protection

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Sekovici, Feb 8 (TANJUG) -- The Serb side has 
information that the Sarajevo market massacre, which killed 68 
people, was planned by the Moslem authorities and that directly 
involved was a foreign intelligence service, TANJUG learned on 
Tuesday from reliable sources in the Bosnian Serb Republic (RS). 
  The RS sources said that the scenario and its media support 
were developped in mid-January with the participation of a group 
of Moslems from former Bosnia-Herzegovina who are active in the 
Islamic lobby in the United States. The preparations included 
three military advisors to the Moslem army who carefully planned 
the time and place of the massacre. 
  The bloodshed at the Sarajevo market was caused by a mortar 
shell and several explosive devices, but the Serb side does not 
yet have all the necessary facts. 
  The RS sources claim that there is no doubt that many 
traces, 
which would immediately show that the incident was 
stage-managed, were removed with lightening speed. 
  They said that the expertise carried out by the U.N. 
Protection Forces (UNPROFOR) was superficial and underscored the 
significance of the fact that the Moslems refused to agree that 
Serb experts take part in the investigation. 
  The RS sources said that the criminal action aimed to create 
a reason for the continuation of the pressure against the 
Bosnian Serbs, to provoke NATO air strikes and support the 
Moslem side in its aspirations to control the entire Bosnian 
territory. 
  The sources said that the stage-managed action is also an 
attempt to bring about the failure of the Geneva peace talks and 
to provide a justification to the Moslem side not to sign the 
peace plan. 
  All this is supported by the fact that Moslem Presidency 
Vice-President Ejup Ganic on Monday revealed a new Moslem 
proposal to create a cantonal Bosnia. 
  The Bosnian Serb sources learned that a new stage-managed 
action is planned in case the Sarajevo incident fails to achieve 
the wanted results, thus confirming the determination to realize 
these aims. The sources said that Moslem ambassador in the 
United Nations, Muhamed Secirbegovic, on Monday openly 
threatened to do this. If NATO fails to carry out the sir 
strikes "such incidents will recur," he said.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Nikola Koljevic, vice president of </F>
the Srpska republic, by Slobodan Jankovic in Belgrade on 8 
February -- live] 
  [Text] [Jankovic] Good day, Mr. Koljevic. 
  [Koljevic] Good day. 
  [Jankovic] We begin this conversation with an unfortunately 
grave fact, and that is that prior to every round of 
negotiations -- from Lisbon to the present -- war drums have 
accompanied the peace process, along with stimulation for 
continuing the civil war between the three peoples. Mr. 
Koljevic, tell us exactly what is being planned at the moment. 
What are we preparing for Geneva? 
  [Koljevic] Well, to be brief, we are setting out for Geneva 
with, like always, our readiness for peace; of course, a just 
peace, and one that will be equal for all three sides in the 
conflict. Concretely, in this case, we are prepared to discuss 
the internationalization of the Sarajevo region; we need to 
approach this theme very seriously and keep in mind all its 
present and future implications. 
  [Jankovic] How far do the Serbian side's concessions reach? 
Is there a limit to the negotiations when -- just prior to this 
round of negotiations, so to speak -- something in the vein of 
the Sarajevo Markale market happens? Is this actually a forced 
concession? 
  [Koljevic] I do not think that this is a forced concession 
if it concerns peace, even a partial peace, but there can be no 
doubt that this represents certain pressure. However, I think 
that this pressure, in the form of such a large-scale and 
scandalous tragedy, cannot be real political pressure on us, 
because in this tragedy, this two-day tragedy -- first in the 
Dobrinja district, followed by the market -- the scenario was so 
familiar that we cannot even accept this as political pressure; 
actually, we can only accept this, treat this, as a great crime, 
accompanied by a scandal. When I say scandal, I have two things 
in mind: Primarily I mean that General Rose did not react on the 
first day but on the second day with his statement concerning 
Dobrinja -- that the shell came from the direction of Serbian 
positions. Whether he did this because he is new or for some 
other reason, I do not know. However, this is not the first 
time that a shell came from the direction of Serbian positions 
but not from Serbian arms. The simplest way -- employed at 
least 10-15 times so far -- is for the Muslim forces to position 
themselves on the same direction with the Serbian forces but 
farther back and to fire from that direction. Therefore, this 
is not proof as far as the first day and the first accident, 
first tragedy, is concerned. 
  As far as the second one is concerned, I believe that it is 
a 
true and real scandal that such a crime was not prevented -- 
that is, that people, experts whom we offered, were not allowed 
to simply seal off the area so they could swiftly and 
objectively investigate who was the perpetrator of such a 
terrible crime. [sentence as heard] This proposal of the 
Serbian side -- I myself was at the airport and five minutes 
after receiving the news, we immediately proposed this; our 
people were ready to go to the site -- was unfortunately 
rejected, and the first, most basic ways, so to speak, which 
allow the culprit responsible for causing such a tragedy to be 
identified, were undermined. I believe that regardless of the 
fact that this first state of affairs was covered up, destroyed, 
so to speak, we have to go on insisting on this [words 
indistinct], and one which would establish not only the military 
but also the pathological aspect of this act. 
  [Jankovic] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Report by Hamiz Deronjic from Brcko] </F>
  [Text] The defense positions of the free Brcko territory 
came under attack again last night. The Serb aggressor fired 
heavily with Brovings, antiaircraft guns and M-84 machine guns 
at the entire defense line of the free Brcko territory. The 
heaviest fire was directed last night at the central part of the 
Brcko front, where the enemy pounded our positions with 60-mm 
and 82-mm mortars from armored combat vehicles. 
  The grouping of the aggressor's forces is continuing, but 
the 
enemy has serious problems with his manpower. At 1820 last 
night a new clash took place and small arms fire was exchanged 
among chetniks in Spomenik near Brod, the chetniks being those 
who had previously burned down Muslim houses at Brod.

  [Text] Belgrade, 8 Feb (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb assembly 
speaker Momcilo Krajisnik has said that the republic of Srpska 
cannot accept the plan on the cantonization of Bosnia that was 
initiated afresh by the Muslim government in Sarajevo last night. 
  "The extremist Muslim leadership must understand that Bosnia 
has been divided and that it would take a great war to reunify 
the disunited Bosnia-Herzegovina," Krajisnik told Politika TV 
this evening. 
  He added that the cochairmen of the conference on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina have been clearly told that the Serb side 
will accept only "the results already achieved at the 
conference." This means, Krajisnik said, acknowledging the fact 
that "there already are three states in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and a revival of a quasi-state of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina cannot be advocated." 
  Krajisnik said that "this means that in no way can we accept 
the plan, for that would mean returning to the Vance-Owen, which 
was flatly rejected by our assembly." 
  Speaking on the demilitarization of Sarajevo, Krajisnik said 
he is convinced "solutions can be found which would satisfy Serb 
interests." "In that case we would not have anything against 
the demilitarization of Sarajevo and the establishment of a UN 
protectorate," Krajisnik said.

<F P=106> [Report by Zdenko Vranjes] </F>
  [Excerpt] The special expanded session of the Chamber of 
Deputies of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna held in Livno 
today ended this evening with the adoption of a declaration with 
no votes against and two abstentions. This confirmed that the 
Chamber of Deputies of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna is the 
sole legitimate legislative authority of the Croat people in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and reaffirmed the principles for a political 
resolution of the state crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The correctness of the stances and activities of the 
legitimate representatives of the Croat people in the search for 
a solution to the state crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina has been 
reasserted at international peace negotiations on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the declaration says. Bearing in mind the 
present international order and reiterating their lasting 
political orientation for peace and a political solution to the 
state crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Chamber of Deputies 
adopted the principles proposed by the commission headed by Pero 
Markovic, chairman of the executive committee of the Croatian 
Democratic Union for Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Begin Markovic recording] The preservation of the state of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as an independent and internationally 
recognized state is only possible through the consent of all 
three constituent, equal, state-building peoples -- Croats, 
Serbs, and Muslims -- and all of them together, through a union 
of republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Second, the right of the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
to self-determination and the realization of their statehood and 
independence will be guaranteed by the Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna in the union of republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
with respect for the right of the other two state-building 
peoples -- the Serbs and the Muslims -- to the same on an equal 
footing. 
  Third, all the rights of the members of the Croat nation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina -- regardless of the internal set-up of the 
state -- must be guaranteed on its entire territory through an 
agreement on peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, achieved by the 
mediation of the international community. By ensuring the 
application of the highest international standards governing 
human and political rights, we will demand the same for the 
other two state-building nations -- the Serbs and the Muslims. 
We are in favor of cultural, religious, and national autonomy 
and local self-administration for every nation in each of the 
three republics. 
  Fourth, the union of republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina must be 
set up as a democratic, multiparty, parliamentary state which 
safeguards and guarantees all fundamental rights and freedoms of 
each of its state-building nations and citizens irrespective of 
their nationality, religion, political affiliation, sex, and 
social status. 
  Five, we support sustained efforts and struggle by the 
entire 
legitimate political leadership of the Croat people in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina for the protection of all national, cultural, 
economic, and human rights of the Croats living outside the 
areas of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna on the basis of 
reciprocity with the other two state-building nations. [end 
recording] 
  In addition to these political principles, the declaration 
supports and accepts President Tudjman's peace initiatives and 
efforts aimed at halting the war and restoring peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, and welcomes the signing of an 
agreement between the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of 
Yugoslavia. Those who have not yet accepted President Tudjman's 
initiative are called on not to seek a solution to the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina through continuing the war. 
  The declaration urges observance of international 
humanitarian law, supports efforts for the unhindered passage of 
humanitarian aid, and condemns every violent act and barbarity 
toward historic and cultural heritage. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Hening Stanislavski, deputy chief of the UN </F>
Sanctions Assistance Mission, by Tsvetana Krusteva; place and 
date not given: "UN Observers Are Confronted With Companies 
That Have Never Heard of the Yugo-Embargo"] 
  [Text] Hening Stanslavksi is the deputy leader of the UN 
Sanctions Assistance Mission that is in charge of assisting 
Bulgarian customs officials to prevent breaches of the embargo 
against Serbia and Montenegro. On 29 January 1994, a group of 
his colleagues were forced by gangsters to leave the Kalotina 
checkpoint at the Serbian border and were followed to their 
hotel in Sofia. 
  [Krusteva] Mr. Stanislavski, how many times did you discover 
embargo breaches? 
  [Stanislavski] We just had a case in Vidin where a cargo 
ship presumably tried to transport 5,000 tonnes of fuel 
deliveries to Serbia. The vessel had arrived downstream during 
the night with its lights out, without establishing any radio 
contact with the shore authorities, and it was caught thanks to 
the cooperation between the Bulgarian customs officials and 
members of the Sanctions Assistance Mission and of the WEU 
Control Group. 
  [Krusteva] How did it happen? 
  [Stanislavski] A customs official who had the evening off 
and was staying at home looked out of his window and heard the 
vessel approaching. He informed his colleague who was on duty 
at the customs office. The ship was followed with a fast 
motorboat, but did not stop until the joint crew showed its 
weapons. The vessel's crew, which was presumably sailing under 
a Czech flag, declared that it had never heard about an embargo. 
The same cargo ship, however, was involved in a similar case, 
in 1993, when its attempt to bust the embargo was prevented by 
the UN mission and Bulgarian customs officials. In another 
case, which occurred in December 1993, the Bulgarian river fleet 
tried to sell seven cargo ships, three barges, and three 
passenger ships to Serbia. 
  [Krusteva] Similar violations presumably occur also on the 
border with Serbia? 
  [Stanislavski] In December 1993, I witnessed how the 
Bulgarian customs officials lost control of their territory in 
Kalotina, because of criminals who were in control of the 
situation. The majority of customs officials are afraid of 
being killed and hence, they are not in a position to cope 
normally with their tasks. It was just before Christmas 1993 
that the police organized an operation in the border area and 
seemed to have solved the problem for the time being. The 
current situation is peaceful, but one never knows how long this 
is going to last, because the criminals who were arrested during 
the operation were released within seven days. 
  [Krusteva] Are you concerned about the 29 January 1994 
incident, and what are the problems, generally speaking, that 
you are confronted with in this country? 
  [Stanislavski] Sometimes we have difficulties in 
communicating and establishing contact with customs officials. 
We are also confronted with security problems that have nothing 
in common with the economic situation. The greatest problems 
are emerging at the small border checkpoints where people are 
waiting in line. Minor breaches of the embargo are always 
likely to occur. I am talking about violations that the customs 
officials are deliberately overlooking. We call them the 
"illegal traffic of the ants." We could prevent them, but our 
task is to cope with large-scale illegal traffic, which involves 
smuggling several tonnes of goods. 
  [Krusteva] What are you supposed to do when you discover an 
act of busting the embargo? 
  [Stanislavski] We are only assistants, which means that as 
soon as we discover a breach we are obliged to inform the 
Bulgarian authorities, namely the customs officials, and 
sometimes even the Prosecutor's Office. It is their duty to 
adopt the necessary measures.

Draft Bill on the Armed Forces and Defense of the Republic of 
Bulgaria": "Green Street to Military Reform!"] 
  [Text] Mr. Chairman, Esteemed People's Deputies: 
  I am happy that a bill which settles a very important 
subject 
will finally be presented to your attention. 
  The goal of the draft bill we submit is to improve in a 
qualitative manner the normative basis of this sphere, under 
conditions of social democratization and the new international 
relations. The Law on General Military Service, which has been 
operative since 1958, does not correspond any longer to the new 
social requirements. The establishment of state organs which 
have leading functions vis-a-vis the Armed Forces and the 
defense, as well as the separation of powers among them, must be 
resolved by a law. Thus much friction, which is evident now, 
will be eliminated. 
  The draft bill is based on the fundamental principles of 
civil leadership and parliamentary control over the Armed 
Forces' activity, banning the Bulgarian Army from participating 
in resolving tasks of internal political character, legally 
determining the rights, duties, and responsibilities of the 
military and improving their social prestige, legally 
determining the prerogatives of the state organs related to 
guiding the country's defense, providing the legal possibility 
of alternative service without having to operate weapons, 
legally settling the Army's participation in the organs of local 
administration, and determining the physical and judicial 
entities involved in the country's defense. 
  As a structure the bill consists of two logically related 
parts -- on defense and on the Armed Forces. They treat the 
subject of the higher state organs' prerogatives in the area of 
defense, the prerogatives of the president of the Republic of 
Bulgaria as the supreme commander in chief, and the prerogatives 
of the Council of Ministers related to the general leadership of 
the Armed Forces. The draft bill explicitly points out that the 
minister of defense is and will be a civilian. This conforms to 
the ban on the military's political activity and represents one 
of the manners of implementing a total civilian control. The 
functions of the defense minister and chief of the General Staff 
are regulated by the draft bill. 
  On the basis of Article 9 of the Bulgarian Constitution the 
draft bill envisages that the Armed Forces consist of the 
Bulgarian Army, the Interior Ministry Troops, the National 
Intelligence Service, the National Security Service, and the 
National Protection Service. A separate bill will regulate the 
Military Police's organization and activity. This is an 
important Army unit. 
  A special attention was devoted to the status of the 
military, namely, entering the regular military service, the 
municipal organs' role in preparing mobilization, the military's 
rights and duties, social security, and disciplinary, property, 
and administrative- penal responsibility. The conditions of the 
military's training and professional development, as well as 
their material security, leisure, and leave are specified in the 
draft bill. The draft bill envisages that the length of 
military service will be 15 months. It also envisages the 
possibility of alternative military service without the use of 
weapons. The regulations and conditions of carrying out 
military service will be settled through another special draft 
bill. 
  In the interest of national security the draft bill 
envisages 
a ban on the participation of the military in political parties, 
organizations, and associations with political goals. 
Simultaneously, as an expression of democratism, they have been 
afforded the possibility of uniting in associations on a 
professional basis. The new elements in the draft bill are 
related to the military ranks attached to specific officers' 
duties. Promotions will be effected when the officers are 
transferred to posts which require a specific rank. This is a 
very important element. I must tell you that four years ago 
there was a very grave situation in the Army, when many 
high-ranking officers implemented inappropriate tasks. This 
caused then a certain inflating of the officer corps. I think 
that the normal pyramid of military subordination will be 
restored through the adoption and implementation of this bill. 
The contract principle is established by the draft bill as the 
strategy in cadre policy, which provides the military with 
legal, professional, and social guarantees. This will create 
the possibility of a gradual transition toward a professional 
army. The military service age limit for the various ranks was 
determined in accordance with the practice in most European 
states and needs of the Army itself. 
  I think that the draft bill that has been submitted to your 
attention represents a legal foundation on which all legislative 
aspects of the sphere of the Armed Forces and defense will 
develop. The adoption of this draft bill will facilitate the 
implementation of the reform in the Army in accordance with the 
processes of democratizing society. Thank you for your 
attention!

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak by Andrzej </F>
Woyciechowski at the Radio Zet studio in Warsaw; from the "Guest 
of Radio Zet" program--live] 
  [Text] [Woyciechowski] Radio Zet's guest today is Prime 
Minister Waldemar Pawlak. Good morning to you. 
  [Pawlak] Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. 
  [Woyciechowski] Last night, you said on television that you 
had made a decision on Borowski's resignation. Have you already 
signed the document, or will you sign it in the future? In 
other words, is the decision final? 
  [Pawlak] Of course, these procedural issues will take some 
time yet, but these decisions were made not so much because I 
wanted it so but because of declarations by the concerned 
persons themselves. I think that the way it is in politics is 
that sometimes one knows another politician very well on a 
personal level, and we are colleagues in that regard, but when 
it comes to the political arrangement, sometimes you have to 
take a different path than your colleague, and perhaps this is 
what happened in this case. I think this should not have a 
bearing on the future or on our mutual relationship, either on a 
personal level or on a political one. You simply must 
concentrate not just on procedural or personnel issues, but on 
specific problems. There are different positions from which one 
may approach solving these problems. 
  [Woyciechowski] A decision on a deputy prime minister's 
resignation--is that the kind of decision the prime minister 
consults the president about? 
  [Pawlak, hesitating] Of course, one could think of a number 
of different formal obstacles, but I do not think that is the 
case here. As far as constitutional provisions are concerned, 
the prime minister submits a motion to the president, who signs 
it. Naturally, he does not have to sign it; such cases have 
occurred under the previous cabinet, but I think it will not 
happen in this case. 
  [Woyciechowski] And now let us talk for a while about 
Borowski's successor. This will be decided within the next few 
days. How will it happen? Will the Democratic Left Alliance 
[SLD] or Kwasniewski suggest a candidate whom he will select 
himself and you will then approve automatically, or do you 
intend to select a candidate from among several options? In a 
word, who will select Borowski's successor--you or the SLD? 
  [Pawlak] We will talk about that. I cannot say at this point 
what will happen, but I do not think the decision will be made 
by a single person or by just one side. We will talk about that 
together [with the SLD]. I just want to strongly emphasize that 
the post and the whole area of issues was reserved for the SLD 
under the coalition agreement we signed last year, and I think 
we will follow that provision. 
  [Woyciechowski] Does that mean that you will approve of any 
candidate suggested by the SLD? 
  [Pawlak] We will talk about that. I think both we and they 
are eager to see a candidate who is well prepared, who is an 
expert on financial issues and on economic policies. In that 
case, such a person has a big chance to be selected for the post. 
  [Woyciechowski] Last night, the SLD leaders said they 
already have a good candidate, but they cannot reveal his name 
yet. Are you, Mr. Prime Minister, familiar with the name? 
  [Pawlak] Well, I have not heard about that, either, so let 
us wait patiently for a while longer. 
  [Woyciechowski] Borowski had two posts: deputy prime 
minister and finance minister. Will these continue to be 
performed by a single person, or will you separate the two posts? 
  [Pawlak] I really think that to go into detail too much is 
a little premature right now. We will talk about th at issue 
within the coalition. and then I think we will make a final 
decision. 
  [Woyciechowski] Will these talks take place tonight? 
  [Pawlak] Yes, talks between the coalition partners are 
scheduled to take place tonight, and I think we will discuss 
specific issues then. I would like to turn your attention to 
the fact that this is not a procedural or personnel problem but 
one linked to divisions or different approaches to the reforms. 
These divisions or approaches exist within the two parties 
themselves. It used to be quite simple. All you had to do was 
speak out in favor of this or that kind of political regime, and 
this enabled you to become the guardian of the holy fire. But 
today, when everyone is in favor of democracy and the free 
market, it is no longer the case that you have just one party or 
one individual who guarantees that the reforms will not deviate 
from the right path. The direction of our reforms was approved 
by the entire society. The quality and rate of these 
changes--that remains an open issue. The first issue is the 
manner in which we reach the goal of a market economy, and these 
issues are discussed not only between the parties but also 
within the parties. That can be seen from what happened 
yesterday. This can be seen in both the SLD and the Polish 
Peasant Party [PSL]. I think this is the main and fundamental 
problem we are facing now in the entire parliament. 
  [Woyciechowski] So, if I understand correctly, the issue is 
not about personnel changes but more about changes in economic 
policies. Will Poland's economic policies be changed with 
Borowski's departure? 
  [Pawlak] I would like to turn your attention to the fact 
that the fundamental elements--that is to say, the issue of 
financial discipline and the degree to which the budget is 
realistic--are equally....[Pawlak pauses] We all attach equal 
importance to these issues because they determine the degree to 
which our measures are realistic. But different aspects may 
receive different degrees of attention; the main investment 
directions may receive a different kind of attention. Apart 
from the strictly financial or budget-related issues, attention 
must also be paid to the budget's impact on both companies and 
big social groups. 
  [Woyciechowski] Mr. Prime Minister, now the last of the 
rumors that have been appearing in the papers recently. A few 
of the dailies write about that today: Do you take into account 
the possibility of a resignation by Minister [and chief of the 
Office of the Council of Ministers] Strak? 
  [Pawlak] Perhaps once he offers his resignation. So far he 
has not resigned. 
  [Woyciechowski] So, in other words, it does not look like he 
is going anywhere. Now, a somewhat more serious question: Is 
there an alternative to the current coalition? 
  [Pawlak] I think the election results and the current 
parliamentary configuration are responsible for the fact that we 
must first look for solutions within the current coalition. I 
can see that kind of will and readiness to act in both the PSL 
and the SLD. Of course, we cannot find solutions quickly and 
easily to all of the issues, but the essence of politics is 
about looking for compromise solutions; it is not a zero-balance 
game, where, if one wins, the other party must lose completely. 
The situation we have is such that, as long as we can come up 
with an acceptable compromise and an agreement, we gain much 
more in total than in situations where we would decide to butt 
our heads together. I think that, while looking for specific 
solutions, we will definitely move ahead much faster than by 
focusing on procedural issues only. These issues of procedure 
and organization-management are important, but they do not 
constitute a topic for public debate because they are the 
internal business of the various organizations and structures. 
  [Woyciechowski] That was an extremely diplomatic response. 
What you really meant was: No, there is no alternative. But 
you began the sentence with the phrase "we must first look for 
solutions." When one talks about something being first, that 
means there is something second as well, that there is another 
some kind of.... 
  [Pawlak, interrupting] You [addressing Woyciechowski] are 
always able to read my mind perfectly and then interpret what I 
want to say in your own way. I think I will not disturb the 
harmony you just introduced. 
  [Woyciechowski] But the question is: Is there an 
alternative to the current coalition? I mean not as of today 
but perhaps in six months. Or perhaps there is no alternative 
arithmetically speaking, or in terms of party programs, and so 
the coalition must continue in its current shape? 
  [Pawlak] I think for the coalition to continue is the most 
likely solution for right now, and I think one should focus on 
that, without looking for some kind of strange or exotic 
solutions. 
  [Woyciechowski] When you say exotic solutions, you are 
certainly making an allusion to what the press has also been 
writing about for a few days now: he possibility of a coalition 
among the PSL, the Confederation for an Independent Poland 
[KPN], part of the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ], and 
the Nonparty Bloc in Support of Reforms [BBWR]. Is my 
understanding correct here? 
  [Pawlak] Well, on that issue, unfortunately you [addressing 
Woyciechowski and laughing] are abusing your rights here by 
describing these issues according to your own criteria. By the 
same token, one could say that some offers made by the 
Democratic Union [UD] addressed to the SLD may seem surprising, 
in particular because there was a time when declarations were 
made [by UD] in no uncertain terms that there would be no 
agreement, period. But, as you can see, overcoming prejudices 
is possible even between the two parties, and I think it is the 
right thing to do since it is about time to put an end to 
historical divisions, and it is time to start talking about the 
problems. I think that, when one looks at the current 
situation, amidst all the emotions linked to all of the 
personnel issues, what struck me was that so little attention 
was paid to such an important event as the treaty of association 
with the EEC, which became effective on 1 February; the signing 
of the "Partnership for Peace" that took place on 2 February; or 
even the processes that are taking place here in Poland--I mean 
the issue of talks between the government and employers on one 
hand, and trade unions on the other. These talks are conducted 
by Deputy Prime Minister Cimoszewicz and [Labor] Minister Leszek 
Miller. During these talks, such issues are debated as the 
economic system's fundamental parameters and also the parameters 
of the program we will implement in the near future and in the 
following years. There was little talk, for instance, about 
yesterday's meeting between [Industry and Trade] Minister Pol 
and the miners trade unions. I think these--at least the last 
two cases I mentioned--are the kinds of events that determine 
our ability to conduct talks together and look for solutions. 
We talk in a peaceful manner and not through various kinds of 
protests or street demonstrations. These are also factors 
shaping our reality today. I think we should make a joint 
effort so that journalists not only focus on easily visible 
sensations but devote at least a little of their time to 
significant and serious problems. Perhaps these do not provide 
as many emotions as.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] As the case of [recently 
dismissed Deputy Finance Minister] Kawalec or of Bank Slaski? 
  [Pawlak] Or as some cases of ice skating and broken legs 
[not further identified]. But these problems are certainly 
important, and we must maintain the right proportions or else 
what we have then is the impression that, practically speaking, 
life at the top is just made up of nothing but sensations, and 
those processes that provide fewer emotions and occupy more time 
of the people concerned--these are almost completely ignored. 
That is also a comment against the background of debates or 
criticism concerning the Cabinet's information policies. I 
think that to talk about information policies is quite 
ridiculous to begin with. That is because I do not think the 
point is for the government to organize a press conference every 
now and then and to tell stories. If there are no stories to 
tell, then, even if the government holds a press conference 
every three hours, there will be no one to write or talk about 
it or to present it on television. Information policies are 
about creating such facts and about focusing attention on such 
processes, which are important from the standpoint of society 
and the state, and, in that case, I think that even if someone 
has bad faith, he simply cannot ignore such issues. 
  [Woyciechowski] After such an introduction, I must ask you 
a very serious question. I will therefore ask you about the 
budget. The Council of Ministers will decide today on the final 
shape of the budget. Are Minister Kolodziejczyk and Minister 
Miller going to get more money? 
  [Pawlak] Some corrections are envisioned in the budget. 
They are the result of the possibility of shifts among various 
budget items. They amount to a pretty considerable 
sum--approximately 5.5 trillion zlotys. However, there are also 
proposals and suggestions on the part of the committees that do 
not correspond to real revenues. Therefore, in this situation, 
these proposals are difficult to put into effect. The budget 
must be based on reality. One cannot plan expenditures as one 
wishes. I think that the government has gone to great lengths 
to maximize the revenues and to optimize the expenditures as 
much as possible. Now, this is an interesting paradox: On the 
one hand, we are criticized that this budget is stretched too 
tight, and, on the other, we are criticized that it has not used 
up all of the reserves and all of the possibilities. I think 
this really shows that we have managed to find a solution that 
may not be unique, but that is one of the solutions that can be 
implemented and that resolves the most fundamental problems. 
  [Woyciechowski] This means that this budget will stay as it 
is? This means that there will be no major change in the 
budget? Will there be only cosmetic changes? 
  [Pawlak] We are all responsible for the solutions that are 
in the budget. It is not that one person or one party is the 
guarantee of stability and responsibility. We all have this 
feeling of both responsibility and reality. Now, as I say, this 
budget is not the only... [Pawlak pauses] It definitely is not 
the best possible budget. However, it is one of the solutions 
that can really be implemented and that definitely resolves a 
few problems, such as the problem of lowest retirement and 
disability pensions. These solutions were decided on as early 
as December of last year. Also the issues related to mining. 
We can definitely say that the Ministry of Industry 
concentrated on resolving the problems of mining in such a way 
as to avoid group layoffs; it also does not want mines to be 
closed down en masse. The ministry sees to it that these 
processes are implemented smoothly and gently. If a mine is 
running out of its underground deposits and must be closed down, 
the people working there do not lose their jobs; they are moved 
to other mines. These are examples of very concrete solutions 
that can be achieved even with the small amount of financial 
resources we have at our disposal. They can be achieved if these 
resources are concentrated on the areas that must be dealt with 
most urgently. 
  [Woyciechowski] For a few days now, Poland has been a 
partner of NATO. It has been a partner for peace. Also for a 
few days, NATO generals have been wondering whether the Serb 
positions in Sarajevo should be bombarded. Is Poland consulted 
about such a NATO decision? Has anyoe tried to consult you 
about this problem? Has anyone asked about your opinion on this 
matter? 
  [Pawlak] There have been no such consultations with me yet. 
There have not been such consultations on a government level. 
If my evaluation of this situation is correct, I get the 
impression that these are independent decisions of NATO. 
However, if we take a look at the UN Security Council, 
differences of opinion are quite noticeable there, and it is not 
at all certain whether this particular solution will be put into 
effect. Yugoslavia is an example of a very painful and tragic 
situation, where the elements of hatred have led to a situation 
where probably hardly anyone remembers what exactly started this 
conflict, whereas this destructive war is going on. This war is 
not of a linear nature--that is, where there is a front line, on 
both sides of which there are the two parties. It is of an area 
nature: These communities have mixed with one another for a few 
dozen years, and now it is difficult to find a way to separate 
or reconciliate these fighting parties. First, they should try 
to find a solution themselves. Outside intervention in these 
processes will certainly not yield a peaceful solution. I 
believe that various ideas and solutions are possible here. I 
think this depends mainly on the inhabitants of Yugoslavia; it 
depends on whether they are able to speak to each other 
peacefully. 
  [Woyciechowski] When is Poland going to negotiate the 
details of its partnership in NATO? When will we decide whether 
we should place a platoon, a company, or many divisions at the 
disposal of NATO? 
  [Pawlak] We spoke about this when this document was being 
signed. I think that, generally speaking, we should focus on 
those activities that do not entail any great financial 
resources. Neither side has too many superfluous resources that 
could be earmarked for these processes. Therefore, most efforts 
will probably be concentrated on the elements that are crucial 
as far as the possibilities of cooperation are concerned, such 
as the systems of information exchange amd compatibility of 
managing these complex organisms. Then, regardless of equipment 
differences, it will be possible for us to act jointly and to 
cooperate.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That means slowly and quietly? 
  [Pawlak] I think that many things can be done in this area 
with the resources that we have right now at the disposal of the 
Ministry of National Defense [MON], on condition that they are 
spent on establishing such procedures and solutions that are 
compatible and that would let us cooperate with our NATO 
partners. 
  [Woyciechowski] When will you sign the appointments of 
deputy ministers in the three presidential ministries? Will you 
sign them at all? Has the decision been made yet? 
  [Pawlak] Well, you know, as far as the presidential 
ministries are concerned, I can say that I have signed a few 
appointments. These were not appointments that were not 
discussed and agreed to at the political summit. There were 
earlier agreements. As it turns out, they are not always 
satisfactory in this broad political dimension; however, it is a 
more remote issue, and I think we will be able to find a 
solution that is satisfactory to all of our partners. 
Nevertheless, this must be done in such a way as to focus on 
certain issues; therefore, we should seek people who would 
resolve very concrete and important problems; we should not 
focus on some symbolic ambitions--that this or that politician 
must for a while be in the Ministry of National Defense, the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs, or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
because this would fit the political bouquet. Now, returning to 
issues related to the Partnership for Peace for a while, I would 
like to stress that, since the meeting in Prague, we have been 
very consistently proposing a slightly different concept: 
partnership for development. I must say that this proposal has 
been very favorably received in the West. I believe that it 
would be good if we worked on this concept in our country as 
well, in order to be able to use the opportunities that are 
emerging in all directions; we should also seek partners in 
those places where our offers are answered positively. Now, if 
we implement the partnership for development--that is, if we 
extend the areas of cooperation, especially the areas of 
economic cooperation, as well as cultural and political 
cooperation--this will provide a permanent basis for the 
Partnership for Peace and for enhancing our international 
security. 
  [Woyciechowski] Let us revert to internal affairs for a 
while. You are meeting with SLD politicians, including 
Kwasniewski, this evening. Will everything be resolved tomorrow 
morning in the coalition? Do you think it will be easy to 
discuss all of the issues in a few hours? Do you think this 
will last long? What kind of attitude have you adopted before 
these talks--a very militant one or a slightly compromising one? 
  [Pawlak] Well, I believe we all really want to find the 
right solutions and resolve concrete problems because only then 
can we be certain about our political peace and about the 
political future. The experience of recent years and the 
political configurations in general have shown that peace in 
cabinets is not as important as the resolution of the problems 
that are crucial from the viewpoint of the people. This is the 
best evidence of the efficiency of politicians. I think that at 
this coalition meeting we will certainly seek solutions in the 
individual, personnel dimension; however, we will first discuss 
the strategic activities related to the program of the 
functioning of the government and the coalition; we will also 
try to point to areas that we should particularly focus on right 
now and areas where these resources should be used so that the 
best results can be achieved. 
  [Woyciechowski] What do such talks look like? How do you 
and Kwasniewski address each other? Are you very familiar with 
him, and do you call him by his first name? 
  [Pawlak] I think that the recent weeks have had a great 
advantage: All of us in the entire parliament were able to get 
to know one another. As far as large parts of the Deputies' 
Clubs are concerned, we know one another quite well, and we do 
not address each other by any titles; we are very 
straightforward. This is something I value very highly because, 
no matter whether we are in the government camp or in the 
opposition, we can speak to one another. This goes not only for 
the SLD, but also for all of the other groupings, such as UD, 
the BBWR, the KPN, the Union of Labor.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But how do you address 
Kwasniewski--by his first name? 
  [Pawlak] Yes, I do. It would be an exaggeration.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You are said to be a hard and 
obstinate politician. Now, could you say a few words about 
Kwasniewski's character? What adjectives would you use? 
  [Pawlak] Well, really, I can speak about myself. However, 
as for other people, I believe I should not do what is a 
journalist's job. 
  [Woyciechowski] Today you are not wearing the necktie you 
received from Kwasniewski, are you? 
  [Pawlak] Well, it so happens that it would not really go 
very well with this suit. 
  [Woyciechowski] Are you going to wear it one day? 
  [Pawlak] I suppose so. We will see what the tie is like. 
Perhaps it will be a lucky tie and a lucky solution. I think 
this also shows that politics can sometimes be taken not so 
seriously. However, in everyday life, probably hardly anyone 
realizes that the mental stress accompanying the decisions that 
have to be made is often enormous. It must also be remembered 
that such decisions require both great caution and the feeling 
of responsibility because they concern a lot of people. Here 
one simply cannot afford to make a mistake. As a rule, the 
decisions must be given a lot of thought; they must at once 
start positive processes. 
  [Woyciechowski] In other words, you have given a lot of 
thought to the recent decisions. On the day you signed 
Kawalec's resignation, did you know what would happen next? Was 
this scenario easy to predict? Or did you not know it at that 
time? 
  [Pawlak] It is certainly not possible to predict all of the 
consequences that a given decision may cause, and I do not think 
that... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But you did take such 
developments into account, did you not? 
  [Pawlak] I must frankly admit that I did not think there was 
such a danger; I also thought that the decisions that followed 
were neither necessary nor desirable. I think this affair could 
have been resolved in another way. 
  [Woyciechowski] Thank you very much for the interview. 
  [Pawlak] Thank you.

Article Type:BFN 

<F P=106> [Article by Bozena Wawrzewska: "PSL-SLD: Conflict or Prelude </F>
to Divorce?"] 
  [Text] Quite unexpectedly, and for what would seem 
like a minor reason, Poland's first political crisis since the 
September parliamentary elections has arisen. Regardless of how 
much politicians for both parties try to minimize the conflict 
in their public statements, a situation where a deputy prime 
minister responsible for the economy resigns in the midst of 
proceedings in the Sejm on the budget is certainly not a usual 
occurrence. 
  The introduction of Bank Slaski shares on the stock market, 
as a series of inconsiderate statements coming from Sejm 
deputies for the Polish Peasant Party's [PSL], a hurried search 
for the guilty parties (or, rather, a scapegoat), led to the 
dismissal of Deputy Finance Minister Stefan Kawalec. He heard 
about his dismissal on the radio. It is worth recalling that 
the dismissal followed Deputy Prime Minister Borowski's 
statement, where he took upon himself responsibility for the 
case of Bank Slaski in a way that, it should be admitted, was 
worthy of recognition. The crisis was slowly brewing, but not 
much could be said about its consequences. Things gathered 
momentum after the return of the prime minister from Brussels 
and Aleksander Kwasniewski from Davos. Some explanations were 
made but their contents were not revealed to the public 
completely. The Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] set some 
conditions for continued coalition cooperation. The prime 
minister refused to approve of the conditions. Deputy Prime 
Minister Borowski resigned. The prime minister failed to 
explain whether he accepts the resignation. Instead, he went to 
visit some fire brigade units. 
<H5>  Problems Despite Excess </H5>
  It would seem that the current coalition is in the most 
luxurious situation possible. A huge and overwhelming advantage 
in the Sejm and the capability of enacting into law anything the 
government wants gave rise to assumptions concerning the current 
configuration's durability. But the crisis appeared rapidly and 
quite unexpectedly. It revealed differences that exist between 
the coalition members not only with regard to the understanding 
of some points contained in the joint program, but primarily 
with regard to philosophy and the way of ruling. 
  Differences in approach to the economy, which are big and 
clear, are probably not the basis of the current conflict. The 
recently introduced taxes, additional payments, subsidies for 
the Food Management Bank [Bank Gospodarki Zywnosciowej] and 
other institutions linked to rural areas give rise to suspicions 
that the PSL was successful in imposing on the coalition partner 
a lot of its own ideas concerning economic policies. Many moves 
by the government undertaken in recent months seem beneficial 
for rural areas and peasants. But the point is that decisions 
giving preference to just one professional group--farmers--are 
implemented at the expense of other groups. Protection of the 
obsolete Polish agricultural system makes food prices rise. 
That in turn has the most disastrous impact, first of all on 
the poorest and weakest--those who constitute the SLD's election 
clientele. Beyond any doubt, the PSL cares more for its 
electorate than the SLD when it comes to implementing election 
promises. The SLD tries to make it appear that nothing bad is 
happening. It talks about difficulties associated with the 
transitional period or about future implementation of election 
promises. TRYBUNA, which before the elections wrote about the 
dramatic situation of starving senior citizens, right now is 
using enigmatic phrases to describe the budget difficulties. 
  But these kinds of concessions to peasants must be cause 
for concern for some SLD politicians, especially given the fact 
that other preelection declarations are not being implemented 
for now, either. The concordat, abortion, the participation of 
women in places of authority--these issues were very 
ostentatiously raised during the election campaign, but now 
their solution is being put off until the future. The SLD 
refuses to deal with difficult problems, ones that could give 
rise to conflicts. 
<H5>  The "Who Shall Be Better" Method </H5>
  So the peasants noticed that they can force a lot on the 
coalition partner, which after all won the elections. The means 
to achieve this is a secondary issue. The first signal of this 
style of conducting politics took place even before the 
government was sworn in. Prime Minister Pawlak went to the 
Belweder with a slightly different list of ministerial 
candidates than what he had agreed upon with the coalition being 
formed. The attempt ended in failure. Principles of coalition 
cooperation were signed. Today, according to the SLD, these 
principles are being violated. Local governors are being 
replaced according to PSL criteria, and there are no 
consultations regarding some decisions. It looks as if the PSL 
wants to be smarter that its coalition partner. Or perhaps it 
wants to react the way it used to. Perhaps the heir to the 
United Peasant Party wants to show the heir to the Polish United 
Workers Party that there has been a reversal of roles. The 
peasant party will not be under anyone's heel, as it was in the 
times of the Polish Peoples' Republic. 
<H5>  That Must Offend the SLD </H5>
  But what must really irritate it is the information policy 
of 
Waldemar Pawlak's Cabinet and his attempts to explain what is 
happening. The prime minister, always looking frightened, 
running from journalists and trying to get rid of them; Minister 
Strak, who is aggressive and not nice to press people; and Miss 
Wachowicz [press secretary to the prime minister], who keeps 
issuing communiques to the effect that she has nothing to 
say--all of these make up the picture of the Cabinet's 
information policy. But that is an information policy of the 
government, not just of the PSL. Such a trio cannot possible 
arouse positive reactions, not just from the media but also from 
the coalition partners who, in some cases, are not without sin 
but who have many communicative politicians who have traveled to 
different countries and who like being in touch with the press. 
They also want the current team to come across in the public 
eye as an open, European-style government made up of social 
democrats. 
  That disharmony became visible again during the current 
crisis. The SLD has been holding press conferences and the 
leadership of its main party an urgent session; it explains its 
position to journalists. SLD members frequently appear on 
television. 
  But the PSL is quiet. It does not issue statements or 
declarations; it takes no position. Only once did we have 
[Deputy Sejm] Speaker Zych speaking on television and making an 
appeal to listen to what the prime minister has to say on the 
whole issue. But the point is that the prime minister gives no 
one a chance to listen to him. 
  It is hard to tell today whether this is a conflict that 
will 
pass and that is typical for any coalition's initial phase, or 
whether it is the prelude to a divorce. It is hard to tell 
whether the differences are surmountable and a consensus 
possible, or whether they are too deep and radical to be able to 
eliminate them. In the beginning, the whole issue was being 
minimized. Right now the SLD is trying to make it less radical. 
But many words were spoken and the breaking of the coalition 
agreement was mentioned, as well as the PSL's "buddy policies" 
and mistakes with regard to information policies. If the SLD, 
while using the argument of lack of an alternative to the 
coalition, tries to make the conflict less radical, if it 
encounters the PSL's harsh resistance and therefore decides to 
give up what has been described as "terminal conditions," the 
PSL will strengthen not only its position but also its style of 
ruling. The PSL will simply prove more efficient.

<F P=106> [Article by E. Cz., E.K., J.B.L., and Ma. S.: "Before the </F>
Coalition Summit: Prime Minister Pawlak Accepts Marek Borowski's 
Resignation"] 
  [Text] "Yes, I think Mr. Borowski's decision was made with 
deliberation and consideration, and it should be treated as 
such," said Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak in a television 
interview in reply to the question of whether he would accept 
the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Borowski. "I am 
prepared for a compromise," commented Aleksander Kwasniewski on 
the prime minister's statement. "I believe that the prime 
minister's statement offers a chance for such a compromise. We 
will talk." 
  The meeting of the coalition, which has been planned for a 
few days now, will be held this evening. The leadership of the 
Polish Peasant Party [PSL], which held a session yesterday, gave 
definite support to the prime minister. 
  The leaders of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] publicly 
and personally forwarded several invitations to talks on the 
government conflict to Prime Minister Pawlak. They did not want 
to comment on the fact that, since Saturday [5 February], the 
prime minister has failed to devote a couple of hours to such a 
meeting. They did not have an agreed opinion on how internal 
PSL conflicts affect the personality of the prime minister and 
to what extent decisions of the SLD leadership will be binding 
on his behavior. However, the dominant opinion in the SLD 
faction was that, in the current economic situation, neither 
side intends to risk another early parliamentary election, and 
the conflict has to be settled by Wednesday. 
  A private conversation between Kwasniewski and Pawlak alone 
will resolve the problem. According to unofficial information, 
such a meeting had to take place before the Monday meeting of 
the PSL leadership. Kwasniewski had said at a previous meeting 
of the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement Council [OPZZ] that he 
would try to persuade the prime minister to not accept Marek 
Borowski's resignation. He had also mentioned the possibility 
of achieving a compromise. 
  As we were told in the faction, in case a timely agreement 
was not reached, the only obscure issue could be the behavior of 
the president, who had thus far kept silent but who could also 
appear in Warsaw at any time, convene the government, and join 
the game. 
  He is entitled to do this by Paragraph 2 of Article 38 of 
the 
Small Constitution, which reads: In matters of exceptional 
importance to the state, the president can convene and preside 
over a meeting of the Council of Ministers. 
  During Saturday's meeting of the leaders of the Social 
Democracy of the Polish Republic [SdRP], one of the left-wing 
politicians stated that the entire conflict actually resolved 
itself into a reply to the question of how to manage the 
government efficiently. This quite deceitful formulation 
originated from the reluctance to tease the partner's ambition 
anew. However, a reply to this question is essential, and 
Deputy Prime Minister Borowski's resignation was a tactical game 
that sooner or later will force the leaders of the coalition to 
discuss the essence of this matter. 
<H5>  PSL: To Survive, Not To Yield to Domination </H5>
  Retain the coalition, accept Borowski's resignation (that 
is, 
decline his demands), and not be dominated or incapacitated by 
the SLD--this is what members of the Chief Executive Committee 
and the Chief Council advised the prime minister to do on Monday 
night. Opinions on the crisis and the methods for settling it 
seem to have been very concurrent among the leadership. 
  Following an hour-and-a-half-long meeting closed to the 
press, Prime Minister Pawlak and Minister Strak left by the 
underground garage, avoiding journalists. Vice Chairman 
Stefaniuk said that the PSL did not see any danger to the 
longevity of the coalition, nor did the PSL threaten the 
coalition in any way. In Jozef Zych's opinion, the SdRP 
resolution adopted on Sunday "creates the basis for an 
optimistic view of cooperation with the PSL." 
  Zych stressed carefully that the PSL will not get involved 
in 
the government matters to which he ascribed Borowski's 
resignation and his demands. Meanwhile, the problem of the 
coalition or the PSL also includes the establishment of 
principles in the economic, social, and staff policy. "This 
coalition was born in a difficult situation, and we must not 
allow some problem that I am convinced is not the most 
significant one to decide whether the coalition exists," said 
Zych. 
  The unanimous opinion prevailing among the PSL leadership is 
that the fact that Pawlak held back last week's outburst of the 
SLD's dissatisfaction, even at the cost of losing some 
supporters among his constituents, is positive. Had the prime 
minister applied the same weapon--toughness--and presented his 
own blatant version of developments, had he listed the points of 
the agreement that the SLD failed to execute, the coalition 
would not have been able to meet in its current composition. 
These points include, for example, Leszek Miller's demands to 
amend the budget ("Does the prime minister have to discipline 
the number two person in SLD?") and the OPZZ's draft law on 
repealing taxes on excessive wage increases submitted in early 
December. 
  Borowski's resignation is perceived within PSL circles as a 
tactical maneuver aimed at scoring some propaganda success for 
the sake of athe SLD and thus aimed at taking success away from 
the PSL and the prime minister, who is Kwasniewski's potential 
competitor in the presidential race. Activists for the peasant 
movement are saying that the dismissal of Kawalec had been 
agreed upon by leaders for both parties two weeks before he was 
dismissed by the prime minister. Pawlak dismissed Kawalec 
because he waited in vain for a decision by Borowski. 
  The conflict inside the coalition did not have an impact on 
increasing tensions within the PSL. On the contrary, Chairman 
Pawlak's opponents inside the party expressed their unanimous 
support for him. 
<H5>  Prime Minister's Methods </H5>
  Depending on the situation, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak 
applies two methods alternately (sometimes simultaneously): 
silence and disappearance. The most recent case (before the PSL 
authorities held a session) of the prime minister appearing in 
public was at 1400 on Friday. From what he said at the time, it 
could not be concluded that he intends to reject the conditions 
set by the coalition partner. 
  After that, he was simply unavailable, and not only to 
journalists. On Saturday evening, Aleksander Kwasniewski, while 
commenting on reports that the prime minister went to meet with 
fire brigade members, said with malice that he does not think 
the situation amounted to a trouble spot yet. 
  One of the SLD leaders, who expressed his irritation while 
responding to a question on how it feels to talk to the prime 
minister, said Pawlak is a black box: You talk to him and there 
is no response. You do not know what he thinks because he does 
not reply; he does not even show on his face whether he even 
hears you. As can be concluded from statements by members of the 
Cabinet, the prime minister's silence is his usual style and not 
just a mask he puts on for journalists. 
  So far, both methods have proved effective. The net result 
is that it is the coalition members who get anxious and nervous; 
they keep looking for the prime minister, and they wait for a 
message from him. And he, having failed to make any 
declarations, has all of the possible paths open in front of 
him, and he keeps gaining time, which he needs if only to think 
things through. 
<H5>  The Consequences of That </H5>
  It is the SLD politicians who made efforts to clear up the 
conflict as soon as possible and to hold a meeting among the 
coalition members. But Prime Minister Pawlak announced as early 
as Friday that negotiations within the coalition would take 
place on Tuesday. He was right. 
  The SLD made it possible for it to be maneuvered into the 
position of someone trying to obtain something. This was 
determined first of all by the situation arrangement and not by 
mistakes by SLD leaders, at least at the point when the conflict 
became publicly apparent. 
  Waldemar Pawlak is the prime minister. He can continue to be 
the government's chief, even if the SLD ministers leave. It 
would be a minority cabinet then, even if Sejm deputies for the 
Nonparty Bloc in Support of Reforms and the Confederation for an 
Independent Poland joined in. It seems that, at least for the 
moment, that is the only possibility with this parliament. The 
Union of Labor stresses its similarities with the PSL in terms 
of party programs but not with such a minority arrangement. A 
government with neither the SLD nor the Democratic Union must be 
condemned to the Belweder's support. The prime minister's 
dependence on the president and his minister of state would then 
increase along with the term of office of the minority cabinet. 
Then Waldemar Pawlak, instead of strengthening his position 
(which is most probably what he is after right now), would be 
strongly dependent on another power center. 
  Speaking during a television interview, in which he reported 
that he will accept the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister 
Borowski, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak expressed his 
conviction that the coalition continues to function. 
  "Every one of us, while making a decision, should consider 
its consequences very carefully. We have opportunities to work 
for Poland in different posts," he said. 
  According to the prime minister, the dispute is not about 
procedural issues but about an answer to the question: Are we 
going on, down the road of a simple, liberal continuation, or 
will we be creating a prosocial policy that would be open to the 
needs of the economy but also to those of society? Speaking on 
the topic of differences in approaching the budget, he admitted 
that a budget does not necessarily have to be a convenient 
formula that can be easily summed up on paper. But what it must 
do is meet society's expectations. But the government will not 
present a new draft budget because it bears full responsibility 
for what it already submitted. He said the budget is based on 
the real situation and that it is implementable. 
  "We have an excellent candidate for the post (occupied by 
Marek Borowski). He is a member of our party, but I cannot 
reveal his name before I talk to the prime minister," 
Kwasniewski told REUTER late last night. The information was 
denied by Zbigniew Siemiatkowski of the SLD.

  [Olejnik] The talks between the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] 
and the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] have just ended, and a 
communique was read to us. It states that Poland needs economic 
development, an improvement in people's living standards, 
political stabilization, and a credible position in the world. 
The SLD and the PSL confirm this aim and express conviction as 
to the need for joint actions for its implementation. The PSL 
and the SLD adopt the principle of solid support for the draft 
budget presented by the government. 
  After discussing the resignation of Deputy Premier Marek 
Borowski and the circumstances accompanying it, the 
representatives of the SLD and the PSL express recognition of 
his knowledge, competence, and activism; they confirm that the 
SLD will present a candidature for the vacant post, in 
accordance with the coalition agreement, that together with its 
appendixes remains fully applicable. 
  The PSL and SLD leaders told journalists after the meeting 
that the coalition between the PSL and the SLD still exists. 
Marek Borowski told us that he knows the candidacy of the 
person who should take over the post of deputy prime minister 
and minister of finance in his place, but he will not reveal his 
name to us.

<F P=106> [Aarticle by Agata Nowakowska and Dominika Wielowieyska: </F>
"The Coalition by Night"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, at 2300, the PSL [Polish Peasant Party] 
and the SLD [Democratic Left Alliance] unexpectedly announced 
that the dispute between them was over. They want to remain in 
the coalition together until the end of the Sejm's term of 
office. They will be united in supporting the budget. 
  The leaders of both parties said that compromise was about 
"returning to the coalition agreement and reminding themselves 
of why the coalition was formed." It was formed "to promote 
Poland's development." 
  The prime minister and the leader of the SLD thanked [SLD 
official Marek] Borowski and stressed his knowledge and ability. 
"However," said Sejm Marshal Oleksy, "the prime minister is 
determined, and there is no question of Borowski's returning [as 
finance minister]." 
  Will the government pursue a less liberal economic policy 
course now that Borowski is gone? The prime minister's reply 
was: "This government's policies were not a continuation 
anyway. We have endeavored to pay more attention to the needs 
of the poorest." 
  At 2000, before the talks began, SLD leader Aleksander 
Kwasniewski said that "there is little prospect of reaching 
agreement." However, by 2300, during a break in the coalition 
talks, everyone appeared to be in excellent spirits. 
Kwasniewski and Pawlak shook hands from time to time. They 
invited journalists to have a glass of wine or vodka. Then they 
went off to continue their discussions. 
  PSL Deputy Franciszek Stefaniuk said: "It is better to 
conduct a love affair directly instead of by letter. The same 
applies to the coalition. It is better to conduct direct talks 
rather than to conduct them through the media." 
  The president, who is resting in the mountains, signed 
Borowski's resignation in the late afternoon. "I am in favor of 
presidential government," he commented. Walesa speaks to the 
prime minister on the telephone "almost daily." "I am in 
complete control," he added, raising one of his ski poles. 
<H5>  What Will the Budget Be Like? </H5>
  Speaking on Warsaw's ZET radio station yesterday evening, 
the 
prime minister gave assurances that there would be no general 
change of course with respect to economic policy. The 
government will not increase the budget deficit now that 
Borowski is gone. Yesterday the government had still not 
finished discussing Sejm commission proposals that would involve 
50 amendments to the draft budget. We learned unofficially that 
ministers had agreed to transfer money (about 4 to 5 trillion 
zlotys [Z]) from some areas of the budget to agriculture and 
social welfare, above all. They have not, however, increased 
the budget deficit, as the prime minister, among others, opposed 
that. The government rejected demands from the Agricultural 
Commission for a further Z10 trillion. 
<H5>  Is Chmielak Weaker? </H5>
  The coalition has decided but has not revealed who will 
replace the "politically deceased," as Kwasniewski quipped about 
Borowski. We have learned that two candidates have paid visits 
to the prime minister--the 46-year-old Henryk Chmielak, who was 
a PSL rival candidate to Borowski when the coalition was being 
formed, and Ireneusz Sekula, the head of the Main Customs 
Office. The former seems the more likely candidate because some 
people are of the opinion that "people who belonged to the old 
system, like Sekula," should not receive such appointments. 
  Other names that are being mentioned by journalists are 
Professor Grzegorz Kolodka (who turned down the post in 
October); Wladyslaw Baka, the former head of the National Bank 
of Poland and a member of the Polish United Workers Party from 
1958 until the end; and Cezary Stypulowski, the president of 
Handlowy Bank S.A. 
  There is speculation that Pawlak is seeking to weaken the 
post of finance minister, who has held a key role in previous 
governments. According to unconfirmed reports, the SLD wants 
Wieslaw Kaczmarek, the current minister of ownership 
transformations, to become the deputy minister with 
responsibility for economic affairs. 
<H5>  The Fears of Businessmen </H5>
  "Every day we receive telephone calls from abroad asking us 
what we think. We do not want to paint too gloomy a picture of 
the situation, but, at the same time, the situation does not 
give us a basis for painting a bright picture," says Witold 
Michalek, of the Business Center Club.

  [Text] Warsaw, 9 Feb--According to Zbigniew Siemiatkowski, 
the SLD [Democratic Left Alliance] spokesman, the last-moment 
involvement of the president in the coalition crisis proves that 
if anyone has gained anything at all by the crisis, it was the 
president. 
  "The president has immediately taken the opportunity to 
point 
to the crisis in mutual relations within the coalition and also 
to the imperfection of the constitutional solutions," 
Siemiatkowski said today on Radio ESKA. 
  According to the Alliance spokesman, "the president returned 
to his idea of a strong presidency, which proves that the 
coalition crisis had been watched closely."

  [Text] Yesterday's agreement between the Polish Peasant 
Party [PSL] and the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] could have 
been reached earlier, we were told by Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy 
today. 
  [Begin Oleksy recording] I am greatly relieved by the 
successful and final conclusion of the talks. When it comes to 
the matters that aroused speculations and various rumors outside 
the coalition, the talks have put an end to the state of an 
alleged crisis, or perhaps not even an alleged crisis. They 
have put an end to the real and existing conflict, which was 
interpreted by the mass media almost as a breakdown of the 
coalition, or as the partners parting their ways because of 
internal difficulties impossible to overcome. 
  My feeling of relief comes from the fact that the will to 
continue the strategic cooperation was firmly reiterated 
yesterday not because of the lack of an alternative but because 
all of the elements that constitute the program credo and take 
into account Poland's needs, underlining the foundations of the 
coalition, were reconfirmed. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Hanna Gronkiewicz-Walc, governor of the </F>
Polish Central Bank, by Francoise Delstanche; place and date not 
given: "Continuity in Polish Budget Policy"] 
  [Text] With an economy in transition, Poland cannot count 
on the panoply of instruments used in the West to pursue its 
economic policy. What is more, as Hanna Gronkiewicz-Walc, 
governor of the Polish Central Bank, explained to us, monetary 
policy alone cannot overcome inflation, which, in Poland, is not 
purely a monetary phenomenon. This is a task her country can 
pride itself on carrying out successfully, she explained to us 
in an interview. It can do so despite the fact that, by 
European standards, the inflation rate of 37 percent obtained in 
1993 is obviously still very high and despite the fact that she 
admits that the objective set--namely, to reduce this increase 
in prices to 23 percent at the end of the year--is still fairly 
ambitious. 
  You have to look at the starting point. Indeed, the increase 
in prices reached 2,000 percent in 1989 and 600 percent in 1990, 
dropping to 70 percent in 1991 and 44 percent in 1992. The 
trend is therefore a good one. And the little hiccup recorded 
at the end of last year should not be too much of a worry. For 
Hanna Gronkiewicz-Walc, this increase was caused by the 
expectations created following the change of government majority 
and by a fairly classic end-of-year phenomenon. 
  Moreover, the January figures confirm that there was no need 
to overdramatize the situation, the head of the issuing 
institute thinks. At 2 percent, the inflation rate corresponds 
to forecasts, which has convinced the National Bank that there 
was no need to increase interest rates. 
<H5>  Budget: Better Than Expected </H5>
  However, inflation is only one of the criteria used by the 
IMF to judge whether pledges are being honored. Other factors, 
like the budget deficit or the foreign trade balance, are also 
closely followed by the institution. 
  Poland is about to receive a visit from an IMF mission, 
which 
is to assess last year's "standby" program and start 
negotiations with a view to reaching a new agreement that will 
cover one year or 15 months. Three years would be too long for 
an economy in transition, the governor of the Central Bank 
explained. 
  "We have fulfilled all of our pledges," Hanna 
Gronkiewicz-Walc said with satisfaction, adding that her country 
has not had to use the last installment of credit promised by 
the IMF for 1993. In the budgetary sphere, she added, the 
target has been exceeded because the deficit, set at 5 percent 
of the GDP, in the end did not exceed 3.5 percent. 
  This is logical. "We did not find sources of finance," she 
said, because the financial markets are still insufficiently 
developed. It is therefore the Central Bank that guarantees a 
large part of the budget deficit: 30 to 35 billion zlotys [Z] 
out of a deficit of Z83 billion. 
  As for the change of political majority, she notes that it 
has so far not brought any fundamental change to the budget 
strategy, although promises were made during the election 
campaign. There was no significant progress in social spending, 
Hanna Gronkiewicz-Walc said, at least no more than had been 
planned by the previous government. And she concluded that "the 
voters will be disappointed." 
  On the other hand, the trade balance is still incurably in 
the red, showing a deficit of more than $2 billion last year. 
This despite the third devaluation (of 8 percent) in the zloty, 
introduced in August 1993, and the "crawling peg" policy, which, 
it is true, has been somewhat slowed down because of the 
reduction in inflation. 
  Despite that, the contributions of foreign capital have made 
it possible to increase the currency reserves by approximately 
$200 million. Thus, at the end of last year, they totaled $4 
billion. 
<H5>  Refinancing the Banks </H5>
  Although part of the IMF funds set aside for last year was 
not used, the same should not be the case in 1994. "I think it 
will be necessary," Hanna Gronkiewicz-Walc explained, adding 
that Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak is negotiating with the 
European Union the granting of a loan of some $500 million to 
support the balance of payments. 
  As for the World Bank, the government intends to cancel some 
of its loans of a social nature. Others, however, like the loan 
($450 million) intended to help the bank recapitalization 
program, are highly appreciated in Warsaw. 
  The government is in fact engaged in a wide-ranging program 
to help public banks that are threatened by an accumulation of 
dubious credits to enterprises. 
  The program started last year and consists of helping the 
banks improve their balance sheets before privatization. In 
addition to support from the World Bank, this plan should also 
be funded by the money that had previously been intended for the 
zloty stabilization fund. This fund of $600 million has never 
been used, and the Polish authorities requested that the money 
supplied by the Western countries for this purpose should be 
used to fund this program to help the banks; the request was 
granted. 
  The Polish authorities last year devoted, at the expense of 
the budget and the Central Bank, some Z11 billion to this 
initiative, which started in 1993. They are due to spend Z16 
billion this year. 
  It is difficult to say whether that will suffice, the 
governor admits. But she notes that the dubious credits have 
nonetheless already been reduced. 
  The fact remains that, although the emergency measures have 
been conclusive, it is only in a few years' time that it will be 
possible to restore full health to these banks. 
  And that leaves the problem of the private banks (there are 
more than 70), which generally have very modest capital. 
  The Central Bank has already taken two fairly large ones 
under its protection. On the other hand, two cooperative banks 
and one private bank have gone into liquidation. 
  "It is called the hospital," Hanna Gronkiewicz-Walc 
explained, and she expects to take more institutions under her 
wing. 
  The intention is not to keep them but to resell them via the 
Stock Exchange. However, their accounts must first be balanced. 
  Because one of the problems of these private institutions is 
their small size, the Central Bank has already imposed a minimum 
capital of 5 million ECU's [European Currency Units] as against 
1 million previously. But the government is also trying to 
negotiate with the European Union for permission to use some of 
the funding devoted to PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for 
Poland and Hungary] to save these private institutions for which 
no program has so far been set up.

  [Text] The Slovak state budget deficit reached 4.5 billion 
Slovak korunas [Sk] in January 1994 and was caused by assistance 
given to the National Insurance Fund. This is what Julius Toth, 
minister of finance and deputy prime minister, told journalists 
during a break in the government's meeting today. According to 
Toth, Slovakia's imports from the Czech Republic are clearly 
specified, and Slovakia is linked to our western neighbor 
through several commercial agreements and operations that cannot 
be abandoned merely because Slovakia is faced with temporary 
problems. 
  Toth ruled out [the introduction of] the import surcharge. 
However, he went on to say that the introduction of special 
checks on the borders [between the Czech Republic and Slovakia], 
as reported by TA SR [Slovak news agency], is being considered. 
In the first phase, these checks should concern only 
foodstuffs. In the second phase, they should cover all goods en 
bloc.

  [Text] At its meeting in Bratislava today, the government 
approved the draft addendum on the payments agreement between 
Slovakia and the Czech Republic and the draft agreement between 
the two countries on mutual payments of outstanding claims 
ensuing for the two republics from certain agreements following 
the end of the federation. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Sergej Kozlik said that, on the basis 
of these legislative amendments, the so-called old bloc should 
be abolished and a one-bloc clearing system of accounting should 
be introduced. According to Kozlik, there were no direct talks 
at the government session today about the Slovak budget deficit. 
  At a news conference, however, he said that the government 
had to grant 6 billion Slovak korunas from the state budget to 
commence independent activity of the National Insurance Company, 
which hugely increased the state budget revenues for January.

<F P=106> [Interview with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Lucie </F>
Weissova at the conclusion of his visit to Israel; place and 
date not given--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Weissova] Mr. Prime Minister, the official 
talks with Israeli senior figures are now behind you, so I would 
like to ask you what the aims of your trip to Israel were and 
whether your talks fulfilled your expectations. 
  [Klaus] This is the first visit by a prime minister of our 
country to Israel. I think our relations with Israel have 
always been good. The episode when we had a communist regime 
should be quickly erased. This was the main aim of our 
visit--to learn about the situation in this complicated region. 
It is really not enough to read books and articles about it; 
you need to see it yourself. [passage omitted] The other aim 
was to tell people here about our country. [passage omitted] 
  The last thing is something more specific. For a long time, 
we found ourselves deadlocked as regards an agreement on the 
protection of investments; we signed agreements with a number of 
countries without any problems. However, there was a great 
problem here because of our different views on the repatriation 
of investment profits. Our negotiators had been unable to reach 
a consensus, and the matter really called for a decision to be 
made by two prime ministers--and we took it. We signed a joint 
communique, and the agreement can be signed soon. 
  And something even more important: We are interested in 
opposing protectionism anywhere in the world and are therefore 
offering free trade zones. [passage omitted] 
  I think we have managed to reach the joint conclusion with 
the Israeli side that Israel, too, is interested in creating 
such a zone between our country and Israel soon. This is also 
included in the joint communique that Prime Minister Rabin and I 
signed. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prague (DDP/ADN)--The leader of the extreme 
right-wing Russian Liberal Democratic Party, Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, has threatened retaliatory strikes against all 
countries that participate in the bombing of Serb positions. He 
regarded air strikes against Serbian cities "just as if Russian 
cities were being bombed", Zhirinovskiy told the Prague-based 
newspaper LIDOVE NOVINY. "This would completely change Russian 
foreign policy," he said. If the bombings take place, all of 
those countries involved should be aware "that whatever they do 
to Serbian cities, the same will happen to their countries. 
Bombs will fall on the cities of those countries that bomb 
Serbian cities." 
  Zhirinovskiy confirmed that he had received an invitation 
from the extreme-right Czech Republicans. He would very much 
like to come, even though this would not be welcomed by all 
sides. Zhirinovskiy predicted that the Czech Republic would come 
to a speedy end. "Your country will be destroyed. I assure you 
that, in 10 years' time, neither Moravia nor the Sudetenland 
will exist. The Czechs will be forced to speak German, forget 
their native language, attend German churches, and polish the 
boots of German officers."

<F P=106> [Article by "(ol)": "A Battle for the Future Is Under Way"] </F>
  [Text] Prague--The Czech Government does not anticipate 
any dramatic breaches in the economy's development this year or 
any new and fundamental systemic measures. This statement was 
made by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus yesterday at a seminar for 
senior enterprise managers. 
  According to him, there will be economic growth this year of 
some 2-3 percent. This should be confirmed by the results for 
the first quarter, which, of course, will be compared with the 
low figures for the first quarter of last year, a period 
immediately marked by the collapse of the federation. The 
government's aim is to establish the Czech Republic "for all 
time" in the world of single-figure inflation. 
  At the seminar, which was also attended by Finance Minister 
Ivan Kocarnik and a number of other government economists and 
enterprise representatives, Klaus expressed his concern about 
too-rapid wage increases, but he also assured businessmen that 
the wage regulation applied by the government this year will be 
moderate and mild. The issue involves, he explained later, 
ensuring that the current level and structure of wages and other 
costs are maintained. Given the current productivity of labor, 
infringing them could force Czech enterprises out of their 
markets, which is the experience of some West European countries. 
  In the opinion of the prime minister, an absolutely 
fundamental battle over the future nature of our economic system 
and societal arrangement is currently under way. The question 
is, he emphasized, whether there will really be a free society 
in our country, with a free market or a neosocialist system that 
would lead us into the same traps as the former communist 
regime. When someone regulates something, someone else is 
regulated, and we have had very bad experiences with this, he 
said. Immediately afterwards, he asked all those present to put 
pressure on the tendencies to excessively regulate the economic 
processes. 
  Klaus devoted a great deal of attention to the koruna's 
exchange rate. As he said, the koruna's long-term stable 
exchange rate is a key element of the entire transformation 
process and is a firm mooring for all of the other economic 
quantities. The transition to full convertibility, which, 
incidentally, has its own specific features in each country, is 
not, according to him, a short-term aim but, rather, a long- or 
medium-term one. 
  There is no reason for us to get rid of the fixed point in 
the form of the koruna's stable exchange rate now, emphasized 
the prime minister. He cited the need to maintain monetary and 
fiscal autonomy as another argument against the rapid 
implementation of full convertibility because the Western 
countries with whom we would be competing do not have to deal 
with the transformation tasks we are dealing with. The koruna's 
entry onto world markets could also lead to undesirable 
speculation in the Czech currency. 
  In another part of his speech, often punctured with English 
or German expressions, Klaus said that the era of rescuing 
enterprises via the state budget or the National Property Fund 
is coming to an end. As far as social policy is concerned, the 
government's aim, in particular, is to improve the specific 
targeting of all benefits. 
  When he was speaking about the government's endeavor to 
restrict the bureaucratic moloch, an individual burst of 
applause was heard in the almost full congress hall of the 
Palace of Culture, where the seminar was held. "I am glad that 
someone is happy," responded Vaclav Klaus.

<F P=106> [Article by Gustav Krch: "The Structure of the Czech </F>
Republic's Foreign Trade and Its Changes During the Past Year"] 
  [Text] From the point of view of the commodity structure 
of the Czech Republic's exports, there was, according to the 
Czech Statistical Office, a 2.4-percent increase in the amount 
of plant and vehicles exported in 1993. This type of commodity 
represented 27.4 percent (101,980 million korunas [Kc]) of the 
overall volume. The percentage of industrial consumer goods 
also increased, by 0.5 percent. On the other hand, in the 
structure of exports, the percentage of food products declined 
by 1.8 percent and fuels and raw and processed materials by 1.1 
percent. The Federal Republic of Germany was the largest 
importer of our goods; it imported 26.9 percent (Kc100,137 
million) of the overall volume of our exports, which amounted to 
Kc372,301 million. In 1992, our exports to Germany amounted to 
only 4,321 million Czechoslovak korunas. Germany is followed by 
the Slovak Republic, with 20 percent, and Austria, with 6.2 
percent. The fastest growth last year was recorded in exports 
to Egypt, China, and the United Kingdom. 
  The percentage of plant and vehicles imported was also 
different; however, it declined by 3.1 percent. Overall, the 
amount of plant and vehicles imported amounted to Kc131,297 
million korunas, which is 35.8 percent. On the other hand, the 
amount of industrial consumer goods imported increased by 3.3 
percent. The amount of food products imported was roughly the 
same as in 1992. The value of food products and live animals 
imported, expressed in an absolute figure, was Kc22,863 
million--that is, 6.2 percent of overall imports, amounting to 
Kc366,359 million. Fuels and lubricants had an 11.4-percent 
share in Czech imports, and other raw materials had a 
5.1-percent share. The Federal Republic of Germany is also our 
most important partner in the case of imports; some 25.1 percent 
of our imported goods come from there. It is followed by 
Slovakia (17.7 percent) and the former Soviet Union (11.5 
percent). Imports from Canada, Hungary, and Taiwan increased 
most.

<F P=106> [Article by "tio": "Minister Karel Dyba Wants To Stick to </F>
Low Wages"] 
  [Text] Prague, 7 February--"To remain internationally 
compatible, the Czech Republic must remain a low-wage country in 
the foreseeable future." This was stated by Czech Economics 
Minister Karel Dyba, who spoke to German economic correspondents 
in Prague. Even though wages are rising in the Czech Republic, 
this development is slow. 
  "We cannot afford excessive wage increases," Dyba says. As a 
result of the reduction of real wages in Germany, which began in 
1993 and will probably continue in 1994, the Czech economy 
already has a problem regarding international competition. 
Employers and the state agree on these connections. 
  When asked what the trade unions think about a virtual wage 
freeze in his country, Dyba said: "Trade unions? What is 
that?" Because of their communist past, the trade unions still 
have problems with being accepted by the people, he said. 
  The exchange rate of the koruna has been stable since the 
beginning of 1991. There are no problems of devaluation. In 
1994, the inflation rate will clearly decrease from 
approximately 19 percent to below 10 percent. Furthermore, the 
inflation rate in 1993 was essentially influenced by the 
introduction of the new turnover tax. Dyba wants cooperation 
between German and Czech industry to intensify. A total of 30 
percent of Czech exports go to Germany: "Therefore, I hope that 
the Germans and German industry are well," the minister said. 
In the meantime, more than 60 percent of the Czech GNP is 
produced by private economy, which did not exist at all four 
years ago. 
  Like Dyba, Richard Salzmann, director General of Komercni 
Banka, is in favor of promoting Czech exports. While Salzmann 
thinks that an export promotion program subsidized by the state 
is necessary, Dyba is rather in favor of private initiatives. 
  Salzmann said that the method of privatizing the former 
state-owned companies in the Czech Republic is very good; 
privatization is carried out in part via auctions or direct 
sales to private persons, often foreign investors, and in part 
via a so-called coupon system, in which any Czech citizen can 
participate. The importance of the Stock Exchange in Prague, 
where the fund companies will also be listed, will increase 
quickly. The Stock Exchange started operating in June 1993.

<F P=106> [Article by "(gag)": "Five Air Bases Will Remain in the </F>
Czech Republic"] 
  [Text] Prague--Of the original 12 military airfields, nine 
are still in operation and four more will be closed down within 
two years as part of the Army's transformation. The location of 
the remaining five bases should be confirmed by the government 
in March. Caslav and Namest nad Oslavou (supersonic aircraft), 
Prerov (helicopters), Pardubice (training base), and Kbely 
(transportation base) will obviously be involved. According to 
Defense Ministry officials who attended a meeting with local 
mayors, the airfields' fate was determined by strategic-economic 
considerations and by the willingness of towns and communities 
to live in their proximity. Caslav is still putting up 
resistance, but, despite this, has not rid itself of the 
aircraft. "We will probably have to come to terms with this," 
adds Mayor P. Prochazka. "The soldiers are appealing for our 
understanding, and, of course, they have presented us with a 
fait accompli. How are we then supposed to convince citizens 
that the base is in the defense interests of the state?" 
Operations at military airfields that do not meet health 
standards should be legalized at the end of the year by a law 
incorporating health-care programs for citizens affected by air 
operations. It is envisaged that noise-protection zones, the 
frequency and periodicity of measuring noise levels around 
airfields, construction-free zones, and financial compensation 
to alleviate the consequences of air operations will also be 
determined.

  [Text] [Passage omitted] Assembly deputies who took part 
in the discussion, by a large majority, supported the political 
advocacy of the concept of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a union of 
three republics. Nearly every deputy severely criticized a 
Croat meeting in Sarajevo, which they consider illegitimate 
saying it was politically detrimental to the interests of the 
Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and was in the interest of the 
Muslim side alone. 
  Numerous guests, including Fikret Abdic, a member of the 
former presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina, took part in the 
discussion. 
  Mate Granic, Croatian minister of foreign affairs and 
President Tudjman's personal envoy to this session, also 
addressed the session. Here are some excerpts from his address: 
  [Begin Granic recording] We, the Croats from the Republic of 
Croatia, from Bosnia-Herzegovina, from the Croat Republic of 
Herceg- Bosna, are doing everything to make the war a thing of 
the past; we sincerely wish to end it. We see the only hope in 
peace with our neighbors, the only way out, the only road to 
Europe. [end recording] 
  Mate Granic called for the unity of the Croat people 
stressing that it was necessary to overcome individual 
interests, and commented on Mate Boban's move with the following 
words: 
  [Begin Granic recording] Mate Boban's decision is wise, 
courageous, and honorable. It is in the interest of the unity 
of the Croat nation, in the interest of all Croats. I 
personally would like to thank him on behalf of us all for 
everything that he has done for the defense and survival of the 
Croat nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and wish him success in his 
future work. [end recording] [passage omitted]

observed less and less each day. After a relatively quiet night 
and morning, today at 1030 the Croatian Army launched a fierce 
tank and infantry attack in the northwestern part of the 
Benkovac front in the region of Privega. After the Krajina 
army's fierce response, the attack was successfully repelled. 
There were no casualties in the ranks of the Serbian army, but 
new material damage occurred. 
  The Croatian Army also shelled our army's positions in the 
Obrovac Brigade operational zone. So far we have no information 
about casualties. At the moment of filing this report, fierce 
artillery duels are in progress on this part of the northwestern 
Dalmatia front.

<F P=106> [Interview with Milan Djukic, vice-chairman of the Croatian </F>
parliament and chairman of the Serbian People's Party, by Zeljko 
Luburovic; place and date not given: "Autonomy for Serbs in 
Croatia Is Similar to That in Vojvodina"] 
  [Text] Is there any better occasion for a talk with Milan 
Djukic, parliamentary vice-chairman and chairman of the Serbian 
People's Party [SNS], than that following the signing of the 
Geneva agreement between Serbia and Croatia? There does not 
seem to be. Yet, many severe remarks by Djukic about Croatian 
state policy demand an explanation. 
  [Luburovic] Could you comment on the Geneva agreement 
between Croatia and Serbia? 
  [Djukic] That agreement is certainly a step forward, but 
only toward the establishment of a mutual dialogue between 
Croatia and Serbia, that is Yugoslavia and Croatia. However, 
the agreement does not bring about any advance in the quest for 
a settlement of the crisis in Croatia. 
  Serbia and Serbian policy are key factors in solving the 
problem of the reintegration of the UN Protection Areas into the 
legal system of the Republic of Croatia. Precisely for that 
reason, as far as the agreement is concerned, at the moment my 
attitude would be closer to the assessment made by Milosevic 
rather than that of Tudjman. 
  [Luburovic] In that context, how should the words of 
[Krajina Serb leader] Milan Martic be interpreted, when he 
stated after the victory in the Krajina elections that "the only 
relations that Krajina may have with Croatia are neighborly 
relations?" Does that comply with your assessment? 
  [Djukic] That only speaks for the fact that Milosevic has 
not yet given a sign that the UN Protection Areas in Croatia 
might possibly be reintegrated into the integral Croatian state. 
Therefore, for the time being, Martic also cannot but follow 
Serbian policy on the occupied Croatian territories. At the 
very moment when Milosevic's attitude toward the Serbs in 
Croatia and the settlement of their political problem and status 
becomes more specific, Martic will also become more specific in 
those terms. 
  [Luburovic] Do you think that it is better for Croatia for 
Martic to have won the so-called Krajina elections, or would it 
have been better if Milan Babic had won? 
  [Djukic] It is better that Martic won, because he blindly 
follows Serbian policy. 
  [Luburovic] In other words, you believe that Milosevic will 
support the reintegration of the occupied regions into the 
Croatian legal system. 
  [Djukic] Not only am I sure about it -- I am more than sure. 
And that certainty of mine comes from the fact that the UN 
Protection Areas cannot find any grounds for survival except 
within Croatia. If that is a fundamental truth, than it is 
logical that Milosevic will also have to come to the same 
conclusion, and he may already have come to it. However, he is 
still making good use of those areas while calculating his 
general policy. That policy has not been rounded off, because 
the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina is still uncertain. 
  [Luburovic] Do you link the conclusion of the Bosnian issue 
to the conclusion of the Croatian issue? 
  [Djukic] Absolutely. 
  [Luburovic] In what sense? 
  [Djukic] It is very important for Croatia that Bosnia- 
Herzegovina remains a union of three constituent peoples. There 
are two possibilities for Croatia -- either it will form a 
confederation with the Croatian republic of Herzeg-Bosnia and 
the Bosnian republic [Bosnjacka republika], or Herzeg-Bosnia 
will secede and join Croatia, while in that case the Serbian 
republic in Bosnia would join Serbia as well. In that case the 
question remains open as to what should be done with the UN 
Protection Areas, in which the population is predominantly 
Serbian. Those regions are conquered, and we, as well as the 
world, have to acknowledge that as a political reality, or a 
reality of time, or any other reality whatsoever. 
  A part of that reality is also that the Serbs from the 
unoccupied part of Croatia are leaving in ever greater numbers, 
which considerably changes the attitude toward Croatia. 
  [Luburovic] Where are those Serbs leaving for? 
  [Djukic] Yugoslavia and Western Europe. 
  [Luburovic] These are recent trends, are they not? 
  [Djukic] Yes, they are. 
  [Luburovic] Do you have any exact data on that matter? 
  [Djukic] According to our estimates, in the free territory 
of Croatia there are 200,000 to 220,000 Serbs. Which means that 
almost a third of the Serbs who lived in 1990 in those free 
territories of Croatia are leaving. This is a great political 
danger for a Croatian policy that wants to solve the problem in 
a peaceful way. 
  [Luburovic] How do you assess the arrival of Jovan, the 
Orthodox metropolitan of Ljubljana and Zagreb, in Zagreb? 
  [Djukic] That is certainly a step toward the normalization 
of integral Croato-Serbian relations. That is a sign of the 
sudden furtherance of that normalization, which contributes to 
the affirmation of religious freedom in Croatia. 
  [Luburovic] Do you think that the return of Metropolitan 
Jovan to Zagreb is an autonomous decision of the Serbian 
Orthodox church, or is it politically colored? 
  [Djukic] It is an autonomous decision by the Serbian 
Orthodox Church, which is confirmed by the reaction of the 
Orthodox Church in Croatia with respect to the Croatian 
authorities, the Serbs in Croatia, and so forth. 
<H5>  Yes, We Are Refraining From Discussing Bosnia-Herzegovina </H5>
  [Luburovic] It is noteworthy that SNS deputies always 
refrain from taking part in the parliamentary debates on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. They also abstain from voting on the issue. 
Why? 
  [Djukic] You are right in saying that we do refrain from 
that. It has to do with our attitude, which we have made public 
by criticizing Tudjman's proposal, which he made in Germany, 
that a confederation with Herzeg-Bosnia and the Bosnian republic 
should be formed. We objected to that proposal because it deals 
with legal and political subjects that are internationally 
unrecognized for the time being. Therefore, we believe that the 
problem of Bosnia- Herzegovina is a problem of the three 
constituent peoples, and in no case a matter of the Croatian 
concern. 
  [Luburovic] Still, the Constitution of the Republic of 
Croatia obliges President Tudjman and the parliament to take 
particular care of those Croatian people outside Croatia. 
  [Djukic] Look, the Constitution could have obliged them to 
do many things, if those things had been stated in it. We 
should take care of them, but no greater care of the Croats in 
Bosnia- Herzegovina than of the Croats in Vojvodina, or Serbia, 
for instance. I think that when that unfortunate war came 
about, we were supposed to take better care of the Bosnian 
Croats, but not in such a way that today almost the entire world 
is condemning the way in which it is being done. And all that 
was unfolding in such a way that the relationship between the 
Croats and the Serbs in Croatia have been pushed to the margins. 
  [Luburovic] What do you think about the negotiations of the 
Croatian authorities with the representatives of the rebel Serbs? 
  [Djukic] Those negotiations may last for many years. We 
have always held a positive attitude toward them. 
  [Luburovic] You are not a member of the negotiating team, 
are you? 
  [Djukic] No, I am not, but if you want to know why, you 
should seek the answer in Croatian policy. 
  [Luburovic] From the point of view of the media, one gets 
the impression that Milorad Pupovac is a new political player in 
the game of the normalization of Serbo-Croatian relations. Is 
that an indication that the time of Milan Djukic has passed? 
  [Djukic] The time of Milan Djukic will have passed only when 
he leaves politics. Whom Croatia exploits, and in which way, 
when dealing with the issue of Serbs in Croatia, is a matter of 
those who take upon themselves such roles, without recognizing 
themselves in them, while it is also a matter of a Croatian 
policy that may think that in such a way something might 
possibly be accomplished. 
  Basically, the determination of the SNS and its 
representatives is not to be a disposable party, to avoid any 
conflicts with the opposition, nor to be suppressed by the 
attacks and assaults that speculate about who we are and whom we 
support. We shall persevere with the determination that the 
Serbs should recognize themselves in Croatia in a just way, that 
Croatia should become a civil state, and that we should elect a 
president who will have enough strength to greet his fellow 
citizens, and not just Croats. 
  [Luburovic] Do you think that Tudjman is not such a 
president? 
  [Djukic] We are certainly rather dissatisfied with the 
policy of President Tudjman with regard to the Serbs in Croatia. 
  [Luburovic] Why? 
  [Djukic] We want President Tudjman to be as much the 
president of the Serbs as he is of the Croats in Croatia. He 
cannot be the president of the Serbs if he a priori, as early as 
in his reception address, says that he is the president of 
Croats and all other citizens. I beg your pardon, "all other 
citizens" means that the category of citizens is a second class 
category. Look, if Zagreb is the capital of the Croats, then a 
nasty part of the Serbs in Croatia might ask themselves: Wait a 
minute, if that is so, then what is the capital of the Serbs in 
Croatia? And I must also add that the president himself is 
actually making the Serbs demand that Knin be their capital. 
  [Luburevic] What are your relations with President Tudjman 
like? 
  [Djukic] At least I think they are correct. Which means 
that I have never spoken to the president as though I had any 
complexes, or feared him while approaching him, let alone 
disrespected him. I recognize him as the president of the 
state, but I also freely tell him what is right and what is 
wrong. I think that many would wonder if it is possible that I 
dare to tell the president straightforwardly everything that I 
really think, which is always in the best interest of Croatia, 
the Croatian people, meaning Croats as well as Serbs, and all 
others. 
  [Luburovic] The critics of President Tudjman most usually 
portray him black and white. He is either good or bad. How 
would you portray him? 
  [Djukic] I dislike President Tudjman's occasional lack of 
strength in his own determination when confronted with the 
political attitudes of some individuals. Which means that 
Tudjman could be better as a president. Furthermore, he ought 
to understand that the Serbs make a great distinction between 
the Croatian state and the Croatian authorities. That is very 
important. However, it can be noticed that the president 
equates the Croatian authorities and the Croatian state. We 
draw a distinction on that point. We respect, love, and esteem 
the Croatian state. That is our right and our obligation.... 
<H3>  Serbs' Rights and Anti-Fascist Council of National 
Liberation of Yugoslavia </H3>
  [Luburovic] Is it also a desire? 
  [Djukic] Yes, it is also our desire, but loyalty must not be 
demanded from us Serbs and stressed as a condition. And that is 
because there are also nasty Croats. I cannot understand why a 
Serb, who was twice jailed during the old regime, cannot obtain 
citizenship for that reason, while a Croat, who was indicted 
many times, can. Therefore I want to say as a Serb that I live 
in my country, and that is Croatia. I shall respect and value 
the Croatian authorities as far as they really serve my needs 
and interests, particularly when there is an entire people whose 
affairs are to be settled. 
  Croatia was guilty of a great failure in 1990 when the 
authorities tried to preserve Croatia within the borders that 
had been established in AVNOJ [Anti-Fascist Council of National 
Liberation of Yugoslavia] Yugoslavia, while not giving a thought 
to the problem of how to solve the question of statuses that had 
changed with Croatia's secession from Yugoslavia. At the time 
Croatia did not think that the Serbs, by seceding from 
Yugoslavia, should also keep rights they had obtained earlier. 
  [Luburovic] If I understand you correctly, you are saying 
that the war that happened here was the fault of the Croats? 
  [Djukic] It was not the Croats' fault, but the fact that it 
is a Croatian co-fault is undisputable. 
  [Luburovic] In other words, you believe that all the 
guarantees that the Croatian state has given to the Serbs so far 
have come too late. 
  [Djukic] Absolutely. 
  [Luburovic] But Martic maintains the same. 
  [Djukic] It is hard to change Martic's conviction now in 
terms of what would have happened if Croatia had agreed in 1990 
to establish a civic society, and to give the Serbs cultural 
autonomy. And we also know that the cultural autonomy of the 
Ruthenians, Italians, and others was guaranteed for over 50 
years by the 1974 Constitution [as published]. So, it is late 
now. You see, since the adoption of the Constitutional Law two 
years have passed, while it has still not been implemented. 
  [Luburovic] Are you saying that the Serbs should be given 
more than they are given by the Constitutional Law on 
Minorities' Rights? 
  [Djukic] The problem is that the Serbs have not been given 
anything. They have obtained something on paper, which we 
welcomed, and which we believe should be implemented in all 
segments of society. If Croatian policy had done that, the 
situation would certainly have been different. 
  [Luburovic] Excuse me, but there have recently been frequent 
cases of Serbs, who live at the time in the occupied regions, 
being granted citizenship certificates and their overdue 
pensions are also being paid. 
  [Djukic] That is true. But there was no need to generate 
problems where no problems existed. 
  [Luburovic] There are opinions in the Croatian public that 
the occupied regions could be easily reintegrated in the system 
of the Croatian Republic by taking the military option. 
  [Djukic] In my opinion, the military option does not exist 
any more, not even in theory. The forces of the right and 
impulsive spirits may demand that, but we have to find the 
strength and resources to make the people return to their homes. 
  [Luburovic] What you have just said sounds to me like a 
piece of hackneyed demagogy, particularly because the leaders of 
the Serbs in the occupied regions of Croatia incessantly point 
out that Croatia and the so-called Krajina of theirs are two 
neighboring countries. How are they supposed to come to their 
senses? 
  [Djukic] Come on, what else can you expect from them when 
they know what awaits certain individuals at the end of the 
story? 
  [Luburovic] Some analysts claim that no Serbian option in 
Croatia has as much strength to convince the Serbs from the UN 
Protections Areas of the necessity for the war finally to end as 
Branko Horvat's Serbian Democratic Union [SDU] does. 
  [Djukic] Anybody who can do anything in that respect is 
welcome. Which is to say, if the SDU has such strength, there 
is no reason for it not to contribute to the cessation of the 
war. However, the Serbs are clever enough, and know exactly what 
the Serbian options are, and what the Croatian options are, that 
is to say, which options protect their national identity. 
  Thus we know that the SDU is a Croatian party, that its 
leader is a Croat, but also that there certainly are Serbs who 
support it. Today no one could persuade Martic by saying: Come 
on, please, join Croatia. 
  [Luburovic] Several days ago a group of Serb representatives 
in the parliament founded a sort of Serb representatives' club. 
They had also entered the parliament as Serbs, while some of 
them even as independent candidates. What made them 
characterize themselves as Serbs rather than as citizens of 
Croatia with a certain political platform, or at least as a club 
of representatives of all the national minorities in Croatia? 
  [Djukic] We, the SNS, and our club have been stressing that 
issue since we entered the parliament. You must have noticed 
that we entered the parliament as Serbs, in compliance with the 
Constitutional Law. We did that because, according to the law, 
the Serbs are supposed to have 13 representatives in the 
parliament. And all these people who are joining the Croatian 
parties are joining them as citizens of Croatia who support that 
particular platform. Excuse me, but in 1990 we had 31 Serbs in 
the parliament, as was confirmed by President Tudjman in his 
address to the United Nations. That was when five 
representatives of the Serbian Democratic Party left the 
parliament. 
  Tudjman said himself that those who had left the parliament 
were the legitimate representatives of Serbs. Which is to say, 
that there are Serbs in the Social Democratic Party is not 
questionable, but counting them among those 13 is. You cannot 
have a Serb, a representative of the Croatian Social Liberal 
Party, support something that is in the interest of the 
protection of the Serbian minority in Croatia. 

<H5>    [Box, page 5] </H5>
  [Luburovic] Are you referring to an autonomy model for the 
Serbs in Croatia like that of Kosovo and Vojvodina in former 
Yugoslavia? 
  [Djukic] Yes, I am referring to the Vojvodina model in 1974. 
However, that contradicts Churkin's theory about a state within 
a state, because, as far as I know, no example of such a state 
within a state exists in the world. However, I do not want to 
speak about form, but rather about content. That means that the 
districts of Glina and Knin must be given back to us, rather 
than to be organized within two counties. Furthermore, the 
question of the territorial degree of that autonomy still 
remains open. As does the question of eastern Slavonia and 
Baranja. 
  [Luburovic] I do not understand what is open in those 
questions? 
  [Djukic] They are open because there are Serbs living there 
now. And we are making efforts to ensure the return of the 
refugees to their homes. If that happens, as it ought to 
happen, then the Serbs will no longer be a majority there, so 
what we would understand as an autonomous province is the region 
of the present districts of Glina and Knin, where the borders of 
townships would be taken into account in determining the borders 
of the districts, rather than the existing administrative 
borders. 
  Certain alterations should be made in that respect, because 
there is the question, for instance, of whether it makes any 
sense for the village of Vrhovine to remain outside the borders 
of the autonomous province. If the refugees do not return, then 
the entire political reality will be changed. And I am afraid 
that, given the current policy, the refugees will not be going 
back very soon.

  [Excerpt] Belgrade, 8 Feb (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Prime 
Minister Radoje Kontic today held a meeting in the Palace of the 
Federation with the prime ministers of the republics of Serbia 
and Montenegro, Nikola Sainovic and Milo Djukanovic, the Federal 
Ministry of Information has announced. 
  The meeting was attended by Dragoslav Avramovic; Bozidar 
Gazidova, deputy governor of the Yugoslav National Bank; Zarija 
Martinovic, managing director of the payment transactions 
service, and a number of federal ministers. They examined the 
implementation of this year's economic policy and the program of 
reconstruction of the monetary system and Yugoslavia's economic 
recovery. 
  It was concluded that significant results beyond 
expectations 
have been achieved in the implementation of the anti-inflation 
program, primarily as regards the purchase of foreign currency, 
market supply, and the reduction of hyperinflation. The 
Yugoslav National Bank has up to today purchased foreign 
currency to the tune of 54 million new dinars, and at the same 
time has sold only 3 million German marks, which shows that the 
foreign currency reserves of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
have increased by 51 million German marks in 17 days of 
implementing the economic program. In addition, the level of 
prices over the past seven days dropped by 0.5 percent compared 
with the previous week. Some 150 million new dinars and 5 
million German marks have been deposited in business bank 
accounts. The Yugoslav National Bank has printed notes: 227 
million new dinars have been forwarded to the payment 
transaction service, and 271 million new dinars to business 
banks. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Mircea Cosea, minister of state and chairman </F>
of the Council for Economic Coordination, Strategy, and Reform, 
by Gilda Lazar; place and date not given: "I Hope that the 
Coalition Government Will Also Include Representatives of the 
Opposition"] 
  [Text] When the politically independent economist Mircea 
Cosea agreed to become a member of the PDSR [Social Democracy 
Party of Romania] government and took over the chairmanship of 
the Council for Economic Coordination, Strategy, and Reform, 
some people thought he was compromising, while others thought he 
was sacrificing. One the one hand they said his move was not 
fair play with respect to his colleague [former council 
chairman] Misu Negritoiu, while on the other they said that 
Cosea's gesture had been made out of his loyalty to reform. Was 
it vanity and his wish to climb up the ladder, or rather taking 
on a burden he could not avoid? The various opinions were 
identical merely in two points, namely that Cosea's appointment 
will be beneficial for the party [the PDSR], and that the 
process initiated by Negritoiu will continue, as Cosea is the 
sole trully reform-oriented member of the Vacaroiu government. 
His predecessor's role as the father of the theory of reform 
and as a "decorative object" to cultivate the West's delight 
seemed to be concluded. Before accepting his appointment, Cosea 
asked, and they promised, that they would grant him, full 
decision-making power. Today, five months later, Cosea is only 
allowed to decide upon who should be hired as cleaning personnel 
in his ministry. In all other issues he solely "involves" 
himself. Although he acted as a rebel during cabinet meetings, 
he still managed to be on good terms with Prime Minister Nicolae 
Vacaroiu and with the other members of the cabinet, without 
being vehemently opposed, the way his predecessor, Negritoiu, 
was. However, recently he still found himself in a similar 
situation: They threatened to have him deposed. His position as 
the second man in the government seems to be too important and 
craved for by others. 
  Thus, Cosea was the first case to which the National 
Romanian 
Unity Party's [PUNR's] demands referred to: All ministers 
should be party members. The first compromise step was followed 
by a second [reference to the fact that Cosea recently joined 
the PSDR]. What was it this time? Was it feebleness, 
opportunism, or rather wisdom and readiness to assume the risks? 
Of course, he must have agreed with a certain reluctance and 
only after negotiations regarding, among other things, the 
leadership of State Property Fund [FPS]. But one should always 
watch out for the Trojan horse! One should always watch out for 
the PDSR, even if promised something. Cosea thought that, being 
inside that party, he could impose his point of view and forgot 
about the other side of the coin, namely about the party 
discipline that is valid for all party members, and which should 
be obeyed particularly by the "greenhorns" and the "ordinary" 
members who hold no party office. He is allowed to express his 
opinions about economic issues while in Davos, Switzerland, but 
forbidden to express political views in Bucharest, Romania. His 
party boss, [PDSR Executive Chairman] Adrian Nastase, considers 
that [PDSR Deputy Chairman Ioan] Manzatu, for instance, is a far 
more authorized and experienced person to make such statements. 
Anyway, in the future it may be interesting to see just how far 
Cosea will go and how far the PDSR is prepared to go along with 
him. 
<H3>  "My Joining the Party Cannot Be Interpreted As an Adherence 
Coming From My Heart and Soul" </H3>
  [Lazar] You have repeatedly stated that you were and would 
always be a politically independent person. However, recently 
you enrolled in the ruling party, saying that otherwise you 
could not put up with so much pressure. Do you think that you 
will be more powerful acting from within that party? 
  [Cosea] Yes, I believe that I will be more powerful acting 
from within the party, but I will not use it for personal 
purposes, but rather for the implementation of the action in 
which I have involved myself so much, namely the implementation 
of the accord concluded with IMF [International Monetary Fund]. 
That accord would eliminate the lag between Romanian reform and 
those in the neighboring countries, because that is the major 
discrepancy, not the one between the development stages of our 
economies. The balance of power in our parliament is very 
fragile. This spirit of revenge and the continuous political 
strife are quite tiresome for us, all those who are working on 
our economy. It has become an obsession that our reform is 
being blocked by either one of the opponent parties, and my 
position as a politically independent person has been looked 
upon with suspicion by the political groupings that do not seem 
to comprehend that, in the current stage of Romania's 
development, economy should be a unique issue for all political 
parties. That is why I reached the conclusion that I need very 
substantial political support, not merely to keep the reform 
going on while it is still hot, but also for me to achieve more 
strength for the struggle I wage in my relations with various 
structures. My joining the party cannot be interpreted as an 
adherence coming from my heart and soul. I am far too rational 
a person and too tired of this transition period to believe in 
enthusiasm and swaggering adhesion statements. 
  [Lazar] Did they request you to join the PDSR to keep your 
ministerial office? 
  [Cosea] The PDSR had lured me to join the government without 
naming any terms at that time, but rather by accepting the 
program and the ideas I was circulating publicly, as well as my 
whole activity, which did contest certain structures. Perhaps, 
the surprise some people experienced when I joined that party 
might have been attenuated had they considered the fact that the 
latest measures, goals, economic forecasts, and even the 
short-term programs advanced recently by the PDSR are 
considerably different compared to those it proposed during the 
[1992] electoral campaign. The recent ones are much closer to 
what one could term "the spirit of reform," regardless of 
whether one wishes to admit it or not. 
  [Lazar] Did your keeping the office of chairman of the 
Reform Council weigh more in the balance than remaining a 
politically independent economist? 
  [Cosea] As you have already noted, after my experience with 
the Communist Party, I did assert that I would remain an 
independent person, although, to tell you frankly, none of the 
parties of today's Romania has a clear-cut ideology. On the 
other hand, very many intellectuals fully engaged in the 
implementation of reform feel the need to unite their efforts 
under a certain guardianship. The attempts to unite us within 
special professional groups, I am talking about the Romanian 
Society of Economy, have not satisfied that need, because we 
need political support in our struggle. Well, it seems that, 
today, our parties will only grant such support to their 
members. It is a pity that the main issue seems to be one's 
party membership rather than the fact that one is a promoter of 
reform. 
<H3>  "If They Do Not Sign the Accord With the IMF, My Offer To 
Resign Remains Valid" </H3>
  [Lazar] A daily printed on yellow paper [reference to the 
daily CRONICA ROMANA] recently claimed that you might fall 
victim to the cabinet reshuffle because you threatened to resign 
too often. After the political move you have made [by joining 
the ruling party] the cabinet reshuffle will not affect you 
personally. However, is your assertion still valid, namely that 
you would resign if the accord concluded with the IMF is not 
signed by Romania? 
  [Cosea] Of course it remains valid and it can even be 
extended over other elements. You see, I am not just any 
government member, I am the chairman of the Reform Council. My 
whole concept related to the reform of Romania's economy is 
based on two principles: foreign financing and internal 
restructuring. This means that without foreign financing I 
would be unable to implement the reform and therefore, 
certainly, my offer to resign remains valid. 
  [Lazar] Our accord with the IMF could have become effective 
as early as December last year, or January, had the interests of 
our political parties not prevailed. Have you assessed the 
costs of those delays for Romania's economy? 
  [Cosea] I hoped very much that the accord would become 
effective rapidly. December might have been a utopia, but it 
ought to have been January. The reform is currently blocked 
owing to the lack of foreign assistance. Whether we like it or 
not, whether we so wish or not, the IMF represents the sole 
chance we have of making any changes this year. It is 
impossible to evaluate the costs you mentioned, how much and so 
on. However, the delays can be measured. These delays mean 
great difficulty in the adjusting of our foreign currency 
policy, of our foreign currency reserve, and especially -- this 
is a very grave thing -- no funds are available from the World 
Bank. 
  [Lazar] How much money did we miss from the World Bank? 
  [Cosea] This year, the World Bank was to finance extremely 
important programs, such as the educational and agricultural 
programs, those intended to revive our oil industry, and so on. 
If one considers the losses caused by the blocking of the 
modernization of particular branches, an evaluation can be done 
and its results are certainly very serious. However, I would 
like to avoid being too pessimistic and I do not want to 
dishearten your readers either. Not all time has been wasted 
yet. If we can resort to foreign financing by the middle of 
March, at the latest, we will still have real chances of 
implementing those programs. However, this presupposes that, 
before that, all political interests and relations should be 
cleared up among the parties and that parliament passes the 
[IMF] memorandum. Under such circumstances, I think I have made 
it quite obvious that the political involvement of the persons 
who negotiated the document is extremely important. 
<H5>  "The Memorandum Is the Basis of the Government Program" </H5>
  [Lazar] Might the memorandum be considered as an equivalent 
of the government program, at least in this year, when the 
government is expected to explicitly assume responsibility for 
it? 
  [Cosea] The memorandum is the basis of the government 
program. However, those two documents cannot be identical, 
because there is a great many details and particular elements 
that ought to be taken into consideration. Aside from that, I 
fully agree with you that the memorandum represents the basis, 
the basic structure, the skeleton of the government program. 
  [Lazar] Why does the PDSR fear that the opposition will 
vote against the memorandum, considering that many of the 
principles of that document also occur in the programs of the 
opposition parties? 
  [Cosea] As I stated when I returned from Washington, I am 
personally convinced that the opposition, judging from 
everything it has declared and done so far, will prove to be 
open to the idea of foreign financing, and especially that it 
will favor all methods intended to speed up reform. Their [the 
PDSR's] fear comes from the specific nature of Romanian 
parliamentary and political life, with its constant ambushes and 
guerrilla warfare. They are afraid that the balance of 
political forces might be altered in parliament, which is quite 
possible if the memorandum is submitted to a vote. Although I do 
not wish to be a Dutch uncle, I would still like to suggest that 
the issue of the memorandum should be taken out of the category 
of politically opportune issues, because it is far too important 
for that and I do not think that any of our parties could afford 
to sacrifice 23 million people for the sake of a few more seats 
in parliament. 
  [Lazar] I think we should clear up certain things. Who 
requested that the memorandum should be passed by parliament? 
As far as I know, is was the wish of the Romanian Government, 
rather than that of the IMF, as was being claimed today. 
  [Cosea] You can find the answer to that in something that 
happened more recently. Previously, the memorandum was 
presented to parliament by [former Prime Minister Theodor] 
Stolojan. It was the premier's wish to be fully open about what 
he was doing. He did that because they criticized the way in 
which the previous memorandum had been concluded. Stolojan 
presented the memorandum, but he did not have it submitted to a 
vote. However, one can say that this tradition served as a 
basis for the way things were conceived for this year. The IMF 
suggested that the memorandum should be presented to parliament. 
However, during our difficult and quite lengthy negotiations, 
they repeatedly resorted to the argument that the Romanian party 
lacks credibility. 
  [Lazar] What were the causes of that lack of credibility? 
  [Cosea] Above all it was the fact that the stipulations of 
the previous accords had not been fully carried out. Second, 
the continuous political fighting in parliament created the 
impression abroad, and I am sure that this impression still 
exists, that the government alone does not have the ability to 
vouch for the implementation of the document. All this led to 
the idea that the memorandum should be presented and submitted 
to the vote of parliament. By this, the IMF tried to ensure 
that the opposition knows the stipulations included in the 
memorandum and consents to those terms. 
  [Lazar] Don't you think that this has made things even more 
complicated? 
  [Cosea] Of course we made things more complicated for 
ourselves, because we could have bypassed parliament. However, 
I still think that its endorsement is very necessary and, 
therefore, in my opinion, this tradition should be maintained 
for future negotiations as well. As you said, the IMF accord 
represents an important part of Romania's government program. 
The IMF accord gives that government program precisely the 
things it lacked initially: concreteness and a practical aspect. 
<H3>  "What Romania Needs Now Is a Coalition Government Including 
All Opposition Parties" </H3>
  [Lazar] Besides the communist background of our current 
rulers, social instability, labor actions, and ethnic problems, 
foreign political analysts assess that the nationalist-extremist 
political groupings also represent an element of risk for 
Romania. What is the point in having the IMF memorandum passed 
if, meanwhile, the ruling party sets up a coalition government 
with the National Romanian Unity Party [PUNR] or the extreme 
left-wing parties? 
  [Cosea] The [PDSR's] alliance with the PUNR, for instance, 
is greatly disadvantageous. Abroad, they consider the PUNR an 
extremist party. Thus it is quite obvious that great 
difficulties will emerge again in Romania's international 
relations. This is something that worries me very much, because 
I lived through the period following the miners' incursion [in 
1991 in Bucharest] and I know what it means to have to kneel, 
trying to justify and explain things and make promises all the 
time. 
  [Lazar] What would be, in your opinion, the ideal government 
formula that could create a favorable image of Romania abroad? 
  [Cosea] What Romania needs now is a coalition government 
including all opposition parties, that is, those that do not 
represent the current majority in parliament. Of course, this 
would also have a reverse side, namely that the parties of the 
current majority in parliament would also have to be included, 
and this practically means the setting up of a national union 
government. However, considering the incompatibility existing 
among certain parties, such a government is hardly achievable. 
  [Lazar] How could they reach a convenient formula? 
  [Cosea] I suppose that if they had held longer and more 
flexible negotiations, they could have managed to set up a party 
including all principal elements of the opposition. Such a 
thing would have resulted in two major advantages: First, 
Romania's image would have been different, and second -- this 
would have been fantastic -- political aversion would have been 
bypassed, as they would have set out from the idea that there 
are reformers in all camps. Reform is not the prerogative of 
the government party, or only that of the opposition. Another 
advantage is that they would have found an easier way to 
negotiate with the trade unions. 

<H3>    "Oscillations Between the Limits Imposed by the 
Memorandum and the Limits of the Administration" </H3>
  [Lazar] The memorandum contains a number of stipulations 
that are already outdated or will soon be outdated, and 
therefore they will not be implemented (the draft budget has not 
been forwarded to parliament yet; the Restructuring Agency is 
not under the authority of the State Property Fund; the 
financial unblocking of companies is being done selectively, and 
so on). Do you not think that the government is using this 
period until the document becomes effective to pay off old 
scores instead of using it to promote the memorandum? 
  [Cosea] I do not think the government has any old scores to 
pay off, and even if it did, it would not be able to do so. You 
know very well that the government does not have any power [to 
implement the reform]. It is like a horseman riding a rocking- 
horse. The real power lies with the State Property Fund. 
However, the problem you mentioned does exist, and it consists 
of the fact that certain particular and yet important elements 
display an oscillation between the various factors 
characterizing the memorandum [sentence as published]. The 
reason is quite simple: Whereas the memorandum is a document 
with extremely clear-cut technical features, Romania's economy, 
unfortunately, does not display a similarly clarity. 
  [Lazar] In other words, the memorandum cannot be 
implemented? 
  [Cosea] Can we afford to implement it, for instance, by not 
paying salaries in companies that are in financial blockage? 
Can we afford to renounce certain elements ensuring the 
survival of our economy in order to observe some technical 
stipulations? The answer is not just yes, we can afford it, but 
also that this is what we should do. If not, we will be taking 
half measures and following the policy of fait accompli again, 
and then we will be amazed again that so many things went wrong, 
although I am sure that, on the following day, we would be 
justifying our failure by various theories and nice-sounding 
declarations. 
  [Lazar] Are such oscillations not dangerous? 
  [Cosea] If the foreign financing would have been available 
at the end of December last year, the way I had hoped, very many 
problems related to the limits imposed by the memorandum and the 
limits of the administration would have been solved by now. 
  [Lazar] Still, under such circumstances, the figures 
established by the memorandum seem to be unrealistic. 
  [Cosea] For the time being, I can still assert that 
everything included in the memorandum is realistic. I would 
like to emphasize again that the memorandum is a strictly 
economic and very technical document, although its success 
depends 90 percent on the political climate. No well-conceived 
monetary measure and no fiscal or budgetary technical measure 
can have positive effects if the relationship among owners and 
users, between property and production is not regulated 
adequately. 
<H5>  "Privatization Presupposes Political Will" </H5>
  [Lazar] But such regulations actually mean privatization. 
  [Cosea] That is right, this is the great problem of 
privatization, which, by the way, I do not consider an issue 
that should be regarded as a performance criteria. [It is 
unimportant] whether in 1994 we privatize 2,000 or rather 4,000 
companies. It is unimportant whether the [privatization] 
project is ambitious or not. If we do not manage to turn this 
capital of 2,000 companies into private property, we will fail 
in solving the most important problem of Romania's economy: the 
under-capitalization of our companies. All Romanian enterprises 
have been conceived in such a way so as to be under-capitalized. 
You know, formerly, loans used to be very cheap and they were a 
means of keeping the economy under political control. 
  [Lazar] That may be the case today as well. 
  [Cosea] Current capitalization is immense. However this 
merely refers to the fixed capital. The floating capital, that 
is, the cash flow, are still at a very low level. No Romanian 
company can avoid financial blockage because as long as its 
owner is the state, it will never have sufficient floating 
capital. This problem could be solved if the constant part of 
the capital would be sold, transferred to the private circuit. 
  [Lazar] You have to admit that such a move presupposes 
political will. 
  [Cosea] Yes, that is what it takes, political will. And the 
State Property Fund should become what is actually should be, 
namely a factor promoting privatization. In that respect, 
things are not very clear yet and therefore not really favorable 
for the implementation of the memorandum. 
  [Lazar] Relations between the Reform Council and the State 
Property Fund have become increasingly tense. Is that not also 
blocking privatization? 
  [Cosea] The relations between the Council and the State 
Property Fund have obviously become increasingly complex, 
because, after all, the word contradiction is one way of 
interpreting that complexity. At the Council, we are Currently 
preparing a government decision, which could also be turned into 
a legislative initiative, that does not intend to alter the bill 
on privatization, but rather to speed up that process. This 
does not mean that it is enough if we speed up the selling of 
shares, because, in Romania, privatization has stopped owing to 
the inflation, lack of capital, too high taxes, customs 
regulations that do not support production, and owing to the 
impossibility for people to sell or buy land and other real 
estate assets. Somehow the false idea was created that 
privatization means that a large number of private companies 
should emerge overnight, but we did not ponder enough what we 
will do with them in the long run. The situation is similar to 
the fairy tale of the mother eagle that has to eat up its chicks 
as soon as they first see daylight in order to make place for 
the next eggs in the nest. 

<H5>    "I Have No Idea What Color the PDSR Is" </H5>
  [Lazar] When you took over office you stated that you wish 
to obtain decision-making power for the Council. The decision 
that was recently taken by the government [establishing the 
competence of the Reform Council] contains dozens of phrases 
such as "it approves," "drafts," "elaborates," or "proposes," 
but -- except for the hiring its own personnel -- it does not 
contain any "it decides." What things were you able to decide 
upon before that government decision came, what decisions can 
you take currently, and what decisions will you be able to take 
in the future, considering that now you have a political color? 
  [Cosea] I am not very sure that I really look like an Easter 
egg, being politically colored. That would not bring me any 
advantages and I do not like to color myself either. I have no 
idea what color the PDSR is. The discussions that preceded the 
government decision referring to the competence of the Council 
were very long and complicated. It was established that I 
cannot take decisions affecting the activity of ministries. 
However, owing to the fact that we are supposed to approve the 
decisions taken by ministries, we can still block their activity 
if it contradicts reform. 
  [Lazar] That is not very much, is it? 
  [Cosea] The fact that I can directly intervene in all 
activities regarding the legislative and organizational aspects 
gives me a large maneuvering space and great satisfaction. The 
most important activities in which we are also involved are the 
restructuring of whole branches according to the drafts 
elaborated by ministries and the large-scale privatization 
actions. The Council has the right to regulate the economic 
restructuring actions. In this way, actually, the whole 
activity of the ministries is under our control. 
  [Lazar] That resembles centralism very much. 
  [Cosea] That is a control over the strategy and the general 
orientation [of the ministries], and does not refer to the 
budgetary and personnel aspects or to day-by-day activities. We 
involve ourselves directly in concrete actions designed to 
privatize large companies, such as Tarom [national air company] 
or the mineral water sector. We are even trying to elaborate a 
methodology of the privatization of successful companies, that 
is, those that foreign investors would obviously be glad to buy 
and that therefore can be easily sold. 
  [Lazar] "Involvement" or "intervention" still does not mean 
"decision." 
  [Cosea] Everybody expected that the Reform Council would 
issue decisions appointing or firing people, or other such 
decisions. Unfortunately, we are not empowered to take such 
decisions. 
  [Lazar] You said that the coming six months will be 
decisive. Do you think that the government, after a reshuffle, 
will survive over the next half-year? 
  [Cosea] For the time being I cannot answer that question, 
because I do not have all the information I would need for that. 
I know, however, that, over the next months, Romania needs a 
government much more than early elections. The country's 
political stability has to be maintained, no matter what the 
risks are or what compromise has to be reached. It is true, 
holding general elections now could result in the clearing up of 
the political situation, so one of the problems would be solved, 
but on the other hand such elections could ruin other things. 
Among those other things I would mention the one that, today, 
is most the most important for the nation: the settlement and 
the balancing of our economy. I think that achieving the same 
things in our political life can still wait. Over the next six 
months, the cabinet might be reshuffled quite often. I hope, 
and this is a personal wish of mine, that over the coming six 
months a coalition government will be set up with the 
representatives of the opposition.

  [Text] After returning from Geneva, Tadeusz Mazowiecki said 
that the UN Human Rights Commission, on account of differences 
of opinion, has not adopted a stance on the most recent events 
in Sarajevo. 
  [Mazowiecki] "This disagreement, this impossibility to agree 
some sort of joint stance, but one that is consistently 
implemented, of course encourages agression, encourages the 
perpetration of transgressions of human rights with impunity." 
  In Mazowiecki's view, the very threat of air strikes would 
allow the war to be broken off. The leader of the Democratic 
Union does not think that NATO will decide to use force. 
  [Mazowiecki] "We are constantly having to deal with the 
situation whereby, if one thing is said in Brussels, the next 
day [pauses].... If the ministers say one thing, the next day 
the ambassadors of these same countries say something else, 
ameliorating it, changing it. This is indeed worthy of 
condemnation in this situation--the incapability of adopting a 
joint stance."

<F P=106> [Interview with Sejm Deputy Jacek Uczkiewicz, member of the </F>
Supreme Board of Social Democracy of the Polish Republic and 
delegate to the 45th Session of the Council of Europe 
Parliamentary Assembly, by correspondent Grazyna Zwolinska; 
place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] Last Friday saw the conclusion of the 
45th Session of the Council of Europe [CE] Parliamentary 
Assembly. Among the members of the Polish delegation was Sejm 
Deputy Jacek Uczkiewicz, a member of the Supreme Board of Social 
Democracy of the Polish Republic [SdRP] and secretary to the 
Wroclaw Voivodship SdRP Executive Committee. He took part in 
the proceedings as assistant Assembly member. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Zwolinska] The Polish delegation went to Strasbourg in an 
incomplete composition, did it not? The Democratic Union took 
umbrage and withdrew its participation.... 
  [Uczkiewicz] I was present throughout all of the stages of 
completing the makeup of our delegation. Consequently, I am 
able to tell you that the reasons given by the Union in its 
official statement are not entirely correct. Judging from my 
observation of the behavior of the Democratic Union deputies, I 
would risk stating that they were predominantly motivated by the 
fact that our delegation as a whole refused to approve the 
recommendation of Hanna Suchocka to the function of deputy 
chairperson to the Assembly. In the end, her place was taken by 
Tadeusz Iwinski, head of our delegation and representative of 
the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]. 
  [Zwolinska] What do you mean when you say "her place was 
taken"? 
  [Uczkiewicz] That was the result of a democratic vote. In 
any case, one of the Assembly's ruling principles is that the 
composition of any given state's delegation should faithfully 
reflect the political configuration of forces in that state's 
own parliamentary assembly. By boycotting the Assembly session, 
the Democratic Union expected to encourage the entire European 
Community to boycott the Polish delegation in turn. However, 
our delegation was received entirely normally by the Assembly, 
whereas the Democratic Union's move was interpreted as a gesture 
directed against the Assembly's principal idea. 
  [Zwolinska] Who interpreted in in that way? 
  [Uczkiewicz] The delegates gathered at the Assembly, headed 
by Miguel Martinez, who is currently chairman of the CE. He 
actually mentioned the subject of the vacant seats in the Polish 
delegation's composition during a meeting he had with us. He 
expressed a most critical opinion about the Union's position, 
which he saw as an expression of a failure to understand the 
democratic nature of the rules of the game. He deemed it 
regrettable that the Democratic Union attempted to play its 
internal games at the expense of the CE and its Assembly. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Zwolinska] Did the Polish delegation maintain a high 
profile in Strasbourg? 
  [Uczkiewicz] It was one of the most numerous and most active 
delegations there. Parliament members representing other 
countries generally agree that Poland can play an important role 
in the process of political expansion of Europe's borders and in 
the blurring of the distinction between East and West Europe. 
And it is worth remembering that the terminology based on this 
distinction is still widely used--even in CE documents. 
  [Zwolinska] Thank you for talking to us.

  [Text] Zagreb, Feb 9 (AFP) -- Croatian Foreign Minister 
Mate Granic on Tuesday rejected a plan by the Bosnian government 
to divide the war-torn country into 17 regions. 
  "Only a union (of three ethnic republics) can guarantee the 
future status of Bosnia-Herzegovina," Granic told a meeting of 
the Bosnian Croat self-declared "parliament" in Livno, southern 
Bosnia, in a speech obtained by AFP. 
  Granic said Croatia was "against a return to unrealistic 
positions," alluding to the Bosnian government's plan, which was 
similar to one set out a year ago by international mediator Lord 
Owen and his former colleague Cyrus Vance. 
  Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic presented the new plan 
to 
the mainly-Moslem Bosnian parliament on Monday ahead of renewed 
talks between the three warring parties due to be held in Geneva 
on Thursday. Under the proposed plan Bosnia would become a 
"decentralised state, a state of non-ethnic regions." 
  Granic also said it was Croatia's "sacred duty" to help the 
Bosnian Croats, but condemned "Croat extremism" in Bosnia, and 
said some of the HVO's [Croatian Defense Council] actions were 
putting it in an "indefensible position." 
  He cited as examples the massacres of Moslems by the HVO 
last 
year in Ahmici and Stupni Do, the destruction of the old bridge 
in the divided city of Mostar, the blocking of aid convoys and 
"violations of laws on war and humanitarian conduct." 
  But he added that the "Moslem offensive in central Bosnia is 
the main obstacle to a normalisation (of Croat-Moslem relations) 
and shows that the Moslem leadership is opting more and more for 
the military option." 
  Granic confirmed in his speech that he was to meet Bosnian 
Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic in Geneva accompanied by Bosnian 
Croat representative Mile Akmadzic and the leader of the Bosnian 
Croat forces (HVO) Ante Roso.

  [Text] Geneva, Feb. 7 -- Former prime minister, and leader 
of the Democratic Union (UD) Tadeusz Mazowiecki called on Monday 
for "all means necessary, including military force" to be used 
to end the siege of Sarajevo. 
  Mazowiecki is the special raporteur on Yugoslavia for the 
U.N. Commission on Human Rights. He made his remarks at a 
commission meeting at Geneva following the massacre of civilians 
in Sarajevo on Saturday when a mortar bomb killed 68 people and 
wounded 200. 
  Mazowiecki said that Saturday's crime was not only an 
accusation against its perpetrators, but also against those who 
remained inactive or "again restricted themselves to words." 
  Mazowiecki pointed out that in August 1992 in his first 
report he had recommended that heavy arms which were being used 
by the Serbs to bomb Sarajevo be seized. He also recalled the 
U.N. Security Council resolution of May 6, 1993 under which 
Sarajevo and 5 other towns were placed in a "security zone." 
  He called for the Human Rights Commission to demand that the 
U.N. secretary-general and the Security Council take action to 
"bring into force their resolutions guaranteeing safety to the 
civilian population." Mazowiecki thought that the perpetrators 
of Saturday's crime should stand before a tribunal to be set up 
by the U.N. 
  On February 24 Mazowiecki is to publish another report on 
atrocities perpetrated in the former Yugoslavia. He then 
intends to resign as special raporteur.

  [Text] Sofia, February 9 (BTA) -- There are no new 
elements in the Bulgarian position on the conflict in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav 
Daskalov said before flying to Geneva today. He will attend the 
meeting of the eight countries bordering on former Yugoslavia 
called on the initiative of Yugomediators Owen and Stoltenberg, 
within the framework of the international peace conference on 
former Yugoslavia. 
  According to the Bulgarian diplomat, this would be an 
informal discussion, intended to take into account the views of 
neighbouring states and the influence they could have on the 
three warring parties, with a view to containing and a peaceful 
settlement to the conflict. 
  We think the problem should be resolved in a peaceful way, 
said Daskalov. On the other hand, the siege of Sarajevo has to 
be lifted, and if military strikes should be resorted to, this 
should be done under UN auspices, he also said. 
  Asked to comment on the message by Turkish President Demirel 
to Bulgarian President Zhelev, Minister Daskalov said it did not 
make clear what was meant by military intervention. Bulgaria 
has not changed its position, it is against the lifting of the 
arms embargo on Bosnia, the minister stressed. 
  Yesterday the Bulgarian president's Press Office announced 
that president Zhelyu Zhelev had received a letter from Turkish 
President Suleyman Demirel. In connection with the tragic 
events in Sarajevo the Turkish president had called on the 
Bulgarian president to support the latest initiatives of the 
international community for military intervention to put an end 
to the bloodshed, according to the president's Press Office.

  [Text] Sofia, February 8 (BTA) -- "Yugo-Embargo Repeatedly 
Violated," reads the headline of a front-paged report in the 
DEMOKRATSIYA daily of the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS). 
"Mr. Berov's cabinet is about to finally ruin your country's 
reputation by its inadequate policy and the continual 
Yugo-embargo busting," representatives of UN Sanctions 
Assistance Mission told DEMOKRATSIYA in an informal talk. 
Reportedly, they were categorical that evidence of sanctions 
busting could be found at all state administration levels. "The 
silence and inaction of the government implies blending of 
organized economic crime and government officials," the daily 
writes. According to the paper, at least four trains crossed 
the border with Serbia at Kalotina-Dragoman on Saturday and 
Sunday (February 5-6), one of them carrying 53 tanks of aviation 
petrol. 
  Answering some accusations in an interview for OTECHESTVEN 
VESTNIK, the chief of the Central Service for Organized Crime 
Control, Col. Fedor Vladimirov, points out that "nobody has 
tried to misuse the information the Organized Crime Control 
Service has in its possession." Saying that the service he 
heads has "ample" information about attempted embargo busting 
and that investigative proceedings have also been initiated, 
Col. Vladimirov refuses to give further details because the 
information is top secret.

  [Text] Sofia, February 8 (BTA) -- "The Partnership for 
Peace plan and Bulgaria's accession to it is a political 
decision. It does not offer direct national security 
guarantees," Bulgarian Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov 
said at a workshop on national security here. "But the 
initiative promotes mutual confidence and its better for us to 
join it than to remain outside. This is my personal view," the 
defence minister added. 
  "While Central and Western Europe may be facing no danger 
for 
an armed conflict, there are a number of high-risk factors in 
the Balkans," Chief of General Staff of the Bulgarian Army Army 
General Lyuben Petrov said at this workshop. He believes that 
international guarantees and bilateral treaties will therefore 
continue to play a key role for this country's national 
security. "The truth is that most of our neighbours are 
rearming and increasing their armies' strength," General Petrov 
also said. He went on to cite the military budgets Greece, 
Turkey and Romania have allocated -- over 8,000 million U.S. 
dollars, 600,000 million Greek drachmas, and 500 million U.S. 
dollars respectively -- which, according to the speaker, come to 
prove his observations. 
  Compared to those figures, the Bulgarian Army will just 
survive to the year's end if parliament passes the military 
budget bill, General Lyuben Petrov also said. Aside from these, 
the Bulgarian Army will need more funds to launch the military 
reform and join Partnership for Peace, according to the 
Bulgarian chief of General Staff.

  [Text] Sofia, February 8 (BTA) -- The Criminal Divisions 
of the Supreme Court today decided to suspend the execution of 
the sentence of former communist dictator Todor Zhivkov. The 
ruling was made following a plea of the defence to suspend the 
implementation of Zhivkov's seven-year jail sentence passed by 
the Supreme Court. 
  The defence cited the convict's age and health, as well as 
the complicated range of issues tackled in the criminal action, 
disputed according to Zhivkov's lawyer, Daniela Dokovska, not 
only by the sides to the case. Prosecutor Krasimir Zhekov 
described the motives of the defence as insubstantial and 
insisted that the sentence be carried out. 
  After hearing the sides, the Criminal Divisions of the 
Supreme Court decided to suspend the implementation of the 
sentence until the Supreme Court has made a supervisory review. 
  The seven-year jail sentence passed by the Supreme Court on 
the former head of state and the Communist Party, who ruled for 
35 years, took effect on January 13, 1994, after an appeal with 
a second-instance panel of the Supreme Court, chaired by Melkon 
Melkonyan. Zhivkov pleaded for a supervisory review. 
  Zhivkov, 83, was convicted to seven years in prison and made 
to restore 21 million leva (some $600,000), on charges of 
exceeding powers and sharing out public funds and apartments 
among top aides. A week ago the Prosecutor General's Office 
postponed the execution of the sentence for two months, citing 
the ex-dictator's age and health. 
  Zhivkov is a defendant in the case of granting public funds 
in aid to communist movements and parties in the Third World and 
in the case against the culprits in the 1980's campaign to 
assimilate Bulgaria's ethnic Turks.

  [Text] Sofia, February 8 (BTA) -- At regular meetings 
today, the two major political forces, the Bulgarian Socialist 
Party (BSP, the former Communists) and the Union of Democratic 
Forces (SDS), discussed their stances on the motion of no 
confidence in the government and the debates on the 1994 draft 
national budget. 
  "The government will not fall before passing this year's 
national budget," Socialist MP Rosen Khubenov told a scheduled 
news briefing. In the course of the discussion on the 
forthcoming vote of no confidence, the Socialists expressed 
different views, but democratically arrived at the common view 
in support of the government. "Constructive criticism" -- in 
this way the Socialists describe their attitude to the 1994 
draft national budget. They have serious remarks and 
suggestions to amend the text as well as fears the budget is 
unrealistic, and will urge the Council of Ministers to table a 
bill on a Chamber of Accounts and take firm measures to collect 
budgeted revenues. 
  SDS leaders would not tell the press what the coalition 
would 
do, if the SDS-sponsored motion of no confidence in the 
government of non-partisan economist Lyuben Berov passes. 
SDS-affiliated parties want SDS MP's to leave parliament, but 
the leaders of the coalition have not yet taken a formal stand. 
"You can't expect us to announce in public our cherished 
plans," SDS leader Filip Dimitrov, who today at noon came back 
from the United States, told the press. 
  According to the SDS, this country is seeing a growing 
recommunization. SDS officials quoted the personnel changes in 
the Ministry of Industry, the changes in preparation at the 
Committee of Tourism and changes in liquidation councils 
(implementing the land reform). "What is happening at the 
Committee on Tourism has been inspired by narrow mafia 
interests. This government is subordinate to mafia groups and 
the Communist Party," said Dimitrov. He thinks mafia groupings 
are struggling with each other in Bulgaria and the government is 
made to serve them all. 
  The personnel problem is national, according to the BSP. 
According to Socialist MP Krasimir Premyanov, many of the people 
appointed by SDS are incompetent and use power to gain personal 
benefits, while skilled socialist party public servants have 
been fired for political reasons and forced to earn a living by 
taking low-skilled jobs.

<F P=106> [Andrey Slavkov report: "Podkrepa Opens Third Congress"] </F>
  [Text] Sofia, February 8 (BTA) -- Bulgaria is not being 
governed, the state is in a critical situation, no strategy has 
been adopted for the future development of the economic 
branches, said Dr. Konstantin Trenchev, leader of the Podkrepa 
Labour Confederation, in his introductory speech at the Third 
Congress of the Confederation which opened here today. The 
congress is attended by 830 delegates of Podkrepa structures 
throughout the country. Fifty-eight leaders of foreign trade 
union organizations are attending the congress as guests. The 
delegates were greeted by Enzo Friso, secretary general of the 
International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and by 
Marku Jaskelainen, deputy secretary general of the European 
Trade Union Confederation. The participants were also greeted 
by Mr. Kadir Kadir, deputy chairman of the National Assembly 
(attending the congress in his private capacity), and by Mr. 
Ahmed Dogan, leader of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and 
Freedoms, as well as by some MP's. 
  The opening of the congress was not attended by President 
Zhelyu Zhelev, National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov 
and Prime Minister Lyuben Berov, invited by Podkrepa. No 
representatives of the Bulgarian Socialist Party were invited 
because, according to Dr. Trenchev, Podkrepa does not maintain 
contacts with this party. There were also no representatives of 
the other major Bulgarian trade union amalgamation -- the 
Confederation of Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria (KNSB) 
with which Podkrepa is in an escalating conflict. Dr. Trenchev 
believes the KNSB to be an unprincipled and procommunist 
formation. According to Podkrepa, the Association of Free Trade 
Unions, led by Asen Chaushev, does not deserve serious attention. 
  The government is unable to solve the enormous problems 
facing this country and is leading it to disaster, Dr. Trenchev 
said in his speech. According to him, in such cases it is the 
duty of the trade unions to undertake nationwide actions. 
  In the two years which have elapsed since the last congress 
of Podkrepa, the relations between this trade union amalgamation 
and the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) have deteriorated, said 
Dr. Trenchev who is one of the founders of the SDS. Many 
delegates at the congress appealed for improving these relations 
at today's debates. Others stressed that Podkrepa should not 
commit itself to any political organization. 
  According to Dr. Trenchev, over the past two years the 
confederation has gained in trade union experience and 
professionalism and has established democratic decision-making 
mechanisms. However, the Podkrepa leader also mentioned some 
shortcomings in the work of the confederation, including 
conflicts between its regional and branch structures and the 
failure of the PODKREPA newspaper, conceived as a democratic 
publication but left in bad hands, Dr. Trenchev said. According 
to Dr. Trenchev the most important task of the congress is the 
amendment of the statutes of the confederation. 
  Initially, the independent Podkrepa Trade Union united part 
of Bulgaria's sci-technical and artistic intelligentsia. It was 
founded in early 1989 and became a federation that same year. 
Dr. Konstantin Trenchev is its first chairman and subsequently 
president. At its congress in 1990 the organization was renamed 
Podkrepa Labour Confederation and was officially registered 
under this name in 1993. 
  The decision for holding the Third Congress of Podkrepa was 
taken at a Confederative Council last September. Statutes, 
Programme and the Mandate Commissions will work on different 
organizational issues, including the amendment in principal 
documents of the confederation. Some sections have not been 
represented because of failure to present registration 
documents. The congress is expected to vote 25 resolutions, Dr. 
Trenchev said at a recent briefing. According to a statement 
made by him at this briefing, the congress may discuss a 
decision for calling a general strike aimed at overthrowing the 
Prime Minister Berov's cabinet. The congress will elect a new 
leadership.

  [Text] Prague Feb 7 (CTK) -- Deputy Foreign Minister 
Alexandr Vondra said on Czech Television tonight that the Czech 
Republic would not support a decision to carry out aerial 
strikes against Serb forces surrounding Sarajevo. That would be 
an extreme measure that would not solve everything, this can 
only be done by the warring parties themselves, he added. 
  Sixty-eight Sarajevans were killed and nearly 200 injured 
when a Serb artillery shell exploded in a crowded marketplace on 
Saturday [5 February], causing NATO and United Nations diplomats 
to consider anew, now with greater likelihood, launching air 
attacks against the Serb besiegers.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 8 (CTK) -- Army Chief of Staff Major 
General Jiri Nekvasil said today that aerial bombardments in 
Bosnia would give the war in the former Yugoslavia a new 
dimension. 
  The high state of NATO weaponry would allow very precise and 
selective bombardment, he said: "From a technical point of 
view, it's no problem." Much more complicated is to evaluate 
the results of such a strike and what sense it would make, what 
it would solve and what would happen afterward. This is the 
reason it is being weighed by so many parties. 
  It is also necessary to consider what could happen to 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] forces already on the ground in 
Bosnia. "The number of warring parties could go up to four," he 
said, adding UNPROFOR to the Croats, Serbs, and Muslims already 
at war. "The UN Peacekeeping Forces are not armed enough to 
stand up to everything which could follow a probable aerial 
attack," he concluded.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 7 (CTK) -- The opposition Czech Social 
Democratic Party (CSSD) denounces the Sarajevo massacre as "an 
act of hopelessness and arrogance," CSSD Chairman Milos Zeman 
told CTK today. The situation cannot be settled by a direct 
military intervention as this would only bring suffering to the 
civilian population, the fighting parties should be thoroughly 
separated and the units disarmed so that peace talks could be 
started, he added. 
  The opposition Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM) 
considers the events to be a "monstrous sign of war," but "the 
campaign which wants to use the massacre for an armed 
intervention is suspicious," the party's spokeswoman said. 
  The campaign is motivated by an effort to create a suitable 
atmosphere for escalating an anti-Serbian military intervention 
in Bosnia, no wonder "that the campaign is as usual joined by 
some Czech governing circles," she added. 
  Saturday's [5 February] Sarajevo massacre is a provocation 
which is to serve as a pretext for a "military intervention of 
the Western countries," a leader of the extreme opposition 
Assembly for the Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party 
(SPR-RSC) said. "Even if the West resorted to force, we are 
firmly opposed to the Czech Republic being involved," he added.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 8 (CTK) -- While the Civic Democratic 
Party (ODS) considers military intervention by the international 
community in Bosnia only one of the possible reactions to 
Saturday's [5 February] massacre in Sarajevo, the Civic 
Democratic Alliance (ODA) continues to support resolute military 
intervention, according to the two parties' spokespeople, Jana 
Petrova and Jan Rejzek. 
  Petrova said that the ODS unambiguously condemned the side 
who caused the massacre. "This event shattered us. However, it 
would be neither suitable nor responsible to use overly strong 
words regarding military intervention, which the Czech Republic 
would not participate in nor bear its consequences," Petrova 
told CTK. It is necessary to consider other measures and 
solutions to the situation as well, she added. 
  Rejzek said that the word "to condemn", only poorly 
expressed 
ODA's reaction to the massacre. The ODA has been supporting 
resolute military intervention in Bosnia for some time, and has 
been criticized for this. 
  "The Black Saturday of Sarajevo definitively opened 
everybody's eyes and proved that mere words mean nothing in 
solving the situation in the former Yugoslavia," Rejzek added. 
  Pavel Hirs, chairman of the Liberal Social National Party 
(LSNS), told CTK today that the massacre must be condemned as 
sharply as possible, and if the offender will be found, he 
should be tried and exemplarily punished. 
  Hirs said that neither the United States nor NATO want to 
take a risk, since any military intervention in the region would 
mean extended operation of armies, including air forces, and 
considerable losses would have to be expected. That is why it 
is necessary to seek a political solution acceptable for all 
three parties involved in the conflict, as only their political 
compromise can lead to reinstalling peace, Hirs said. 
  Jiri Dienstbier, chairman of the Free Democrats (SD) and the 
former Czechoslovak Foreign Minister, said that humanitarian aid 
to the wounded and crippled people in Bosnia was necessary, but 
it would be more humane to create conditions to prevent people 
from being crippled. 
  Dienstbier, currently visiting Houston, United States, told 
CTK through his secretary Vera Uhrova that bombing as well as 
any other isolated act or effort toward a partial solution to 
the situation would be fruitless. 
  If the international society wants to take any serious step, 
it has to set a clear political goal, no matter if it is 
installing peace in multinational Bosnia or the country's 
division, Dienstbier said. 
  However, the community must gather all means and forces 
necessary to support its political conclusions, including its 
willingness to intervene on the ground to install peace. 
"Bombing would make sense only as part of a consistent 
strategy," Dienstbier said.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 8 (CTK) -- The year 1994 will be 
decisive for the transformation of the Czech Army, which is 
aimed at making its structure similar to that of the armies of 
the advanced democratic countries, Major General Jiri Nekvasil, 
Chief of the Czech Army's General Staff, told journalists today. 
The transformation is to be completed by the end of 1995, he 
said. 
  Last year, the main thing was to stabilize the units which 
remained on Czech territory after the split of Czechoslovakia, 
and to work out a concept for the Army's transformation. Career 
soldiers serving in the army underwent special tests and this 
was followed by personnel changes, Nekvasil said. In 1993, the 
twelve-month basic service was introduced and a different 
concept of training, he added. All this caused the career 
soldiers to feel socially insecure, Nekvasil noted. 
  The Defense Ministry and the General Staff were reorganized 
last year, some military headquarters were abolished and some 
newly established. Nekvasil said that 777 units have been 
abolished since 1990. 126 units redeployed and 187 newly 
established. Twenty-eight garrisons and 261 buildings were 
transferred to civilian administration in 1990-93, another seven 
garrisons are to follow this year, Nekvasil said. Moreover, the 
Army now guards 378 buildings. Though it does not use them any 
longer, they are watched by some 1,815 soldiers. 
  Important changes occurred in 1993 in the Army's staff. 
6,594 people left the Army, 4,607 of whom were officers and 18 
generals. In the same period, 1,821 people joined the Army, of 
which 244 are officers, and 438 noncommissioned officers to 
serve temporarily in the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] 
peacekeeping forces. 
  In 1993, the Army was reduced by 12,923 soldiers to 90,405, 
of which 32,113 are career soldiers, Nekvasil said. 
  The transformation is to continue in 1994. Among other 
things, the Air Force is to be reduced, and a rapid deployment 
team is to be created, Nekvasil said.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 8 (CTK) -- KORENE (Roots), the first 
Slovak magazine published in the Czech Republic, has just been 
launched by the community of Slovaks. The 24-page monthly has a 
print run of 10,000 and will cost six korunas. Over 300,000 
Slovaks live in the Czech Republic, making up about 3 percent of 
the population. 
  The new periodical is a non-political family magazine aimed 
at Slovaks living in the Czech Republic, editor-in-chief Nada 
Vokusova told journalists today. The magazine will carry 
interviews, reports, information about the activities of the 
community of Slovaks in various regions, a regular overview of 
the most important events in Slovakia and pages for women and 
children. 
  Vokusova said that a large amount of space will be devoted 
to 
letters from readers and legal advice. "At the moment, Slovaks 
living in the Czech Republic -- whether they hold Czech or 
Slovak citizenship -- face problems regarding doing business or 
insurance and need qualified advice," she said. 
  KORENE will receive an annual 800,000 korunas (approximately 
$27,000) grant from the Czech Government. Another Slovak 
periodical published in the Czech Republic is the monthly 
SLOVENSKE LISTY (Slovak Pages), which is put out by the Club of 
Slovak Culture and the Democratic Alliance of Slovaks.

  [Text] Prague Feb 7 (CTK) -- Consumer prices grew 18.2 
percent in the Czech Republic from December 1992 to December 
1993, according to the latest information CTK received today 
from the Czech Statistics Office. When comparing the average of 
1993 to the average of 1992, the level of consumer prices 
increased 20.8 percent. 
  Taking into account basic groups of goods, the prices of 
food 
products experienced a growth of 16.6 percent and those of 
non-food consumer goods of 19.4 percent. These are the most 
important and most widely consumed groups and thus have a big 
impact on the overall price level. 
  Prices in public catering increased 27.5 percent and those 
of 
services by 28.7 percent. 
  The difference between the year-on-year and average annual 
price growth was caused by the fact that prices grew the most at 
the beginning of 1993, while in 1992 they grew the most at the 
end. Since the beginning of 1993, the costs of living have 
increased by 18.2 percent in the households of employees, while 
in rural households they grew 18 percent and in those of 
pensioners 16.4 percent. 
  When comparing the average of 1993 with that of 1992, the 
costs of living of white collar workers increased by 20.8 
percent, in rural households by 20 percent and in those of 
pensioners by 19.5 percent. 
  When comparing December with November of 1993, the costs of 
living of white collar workers and pensioners grew 0.9 percent, 
while those of farming households by 0.8 percent.

  [Text] Budapest, 7 Feb (MTI) -- Addressing an 
international press conference tonight, Hungarian Foreign 
Minister Geza Jeszenszky stressed that there was no bargain 
between Budapest and Belgrade, and Hungary would not ease 
sanctions in return for a more tolerant policy toward Serbia's 
ethnic Hungarian minority. "Such a policy will never occur as 
long as I am in this job," the minister said. 
  Jeszenszky welcomed President Milosevic's overtures toward 
the Hungarian minority, but added that "only time can tell what 
the result will be." 
  The minister rejected the view that either his recent trip 
to 
Belgrade or Hungary's general conduct towards Yugoslavia 
endangers the policy of international sanctions against 
Yugoslavia. He also found it strange that a week after his 
visit some forces at home tried to reassess the modest success 
of his Belgrade visit as a failure. 
  Jeszenszky said that while his visit was followed with keen 
attention in Belgrade, it created little stir in Hungary. 
Almost a week passed before Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, the foreign 
affairs spokesman for the Alliance of Free Democrats, criticized 
the visit. 
  "It is particularly regretful that the Vienna correspondent 
of THE WASHINGTON POST wrote an article which corresponded to 
the belated criticism within Hungary," Jeszenszky said. He 
termed as surprising the conclusion of the newspaper that the 
normalization of Hungarian-Yugoslav ties could severely undercut 
the effectiveness of sanctions against Belgrade. 
  "It is in our fundamental national interest that ethnic 
Hungarians living outside of Hungary should be able to remain in 
their native land, and they should not be forced to leave 
Vojvodina either," Jeszenszky said. 
  "Of course, it is quite difficult to support the endeavours 
of these minorities and to simultaneously foster good ties with 
neighbouring nations which have large Hungarian communities. 
This, however, is the Hungarian Government's policy," 
Jeszenszky said. 
  "Some other players in Hungarian political life 
overemphasize 
one of these two elements. For instance, Istvan Csurka's Party 
of Hungarian Justice and Life presses only for minority 
protection. It raises unrealistic demands and ignores 
possibilities," the minister said. "In turn, the Hungarian 
Socialist Party criticizes Hungarian diplomacy for making 
inappropriate moves towards Hungary's neighbours," he added. 
  Concerning the Free Democrats, Jeszenszky said, "they fail 
to 
notice that Yugoslavia did make certain moves, and not only 
towards the Hungarian minority."

  [Text] Budapest, 8 February (MTI) -- Hungary and Ukraine 
are to cooperate within a peace-partnership scheme, says an 
agreement reached between the two defense ministers in Budapest 
on Tuesday [8 February]. 
  Minister of Defense Lajos Fur of Hungary and Army General 
Vitaliy Radetskyy of Ukraine, held a press conference and said 
their talks also focussed on regional partnership issues, from 
which they do not wish to exclude Russia. 
  In joint arms manufacturing, Hungary is mainly interested in 
components for aircraft, tanks, and armored vehicles. Ukraine 
hopes to use Hungarian experience in reforming its Army. This 
was the second visit of a Ukrainian minister of defense to 
Hungary within two years.

Defence Minister Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy in the Budapest 
parliament on Tuesday [8 February]. 
  Spokesmen said that Boross had outlined the serious trade 
losses caused to Hungary from UN sanctions on rump Yugoslavia, 
and voiced concern over the fate of ethnic Hungarians in 
Vojvodina. Hungary hopes for help from Ukraine in peacefully 
settling the south Slav conflict, the prime minister added. 
  Radetskyy noted Ukraine would increase its peace-keeping 
force in Bosnia under a parliamentary decision. 
  Boross said why Hungary wants closer links with NATO, and 
stressed the importance of the peace-partnership plan. Both 
Boross and Radetskyy hoped for greater business links based on 
mutual advantages.

  [Text] Budapest, 8 February (MTI) -- Hungary's parliament 
on Tuesday [8 February] unanimously ratified an agreement giving 
reciprocal rights to ethnic Slovenians in Hungary and Hungarians 
in Slovenia. State Secretary Andras Kelemen said the November 
1992 accord could set an example for similar deals with other 
countries. 
  Kelemen said ethnic Hungarians and Italians in Slovenia can 
use their native language in education and administration, and 
take part in law-making by means of positive discrimination. 
The Slovenian Constitution allows native minorities to use 
their mother tongue in official contacts at their places of 
residence. 
  Under today's agreement, national minorities can freely keep 
in touch with the parent country, study in their native tongue 
at all levels of education, found learning groups, set up 
native-language information networks, and make business links 
abroad. Hungary has more than 5,000 ethnic Slovenian citizens.

  [Text] Budapest, 8 February (MTI) -- Preparing for general 
elections on May 8, deputies today elected the secretary and 
four members of the National Electoral Committee (OVB). 
  Deputy Interior State Secretary Pal Kara became OVB 
secretary. Members are Arpad Erdei, Hungarian Lawyers' general 
secretary, Sandor Horvath, Independent Lawyers' Forum 
vice-president, Istvan Kukorelli, dean of constitutional law at 
Budapest Eotvos Lorand University, and Janos Nemeth, Eotvos 
general deputy rector. 
  In keeping with the Hungarian-U.S. inter-governmental 
agreement on intellectual property rights, Parliament today 
amended a 1969 law, bringing it into line with European 
legislation. A draft resolution was adopted to join the 1961 
Rome Convention protecting performing artists, audio record 
manufacturers, and broadcasters. 
  Changes concern rights of both authors and performers, as 
well as the patents system. Earlier legislation covering 
chemical, food, and pharmaceutical products protected the 
manufacturing process, while now the product itself will enjoy 
legal protection.

  [Text] Warsaw, Feb. 8 -- President Lech Walesa on Tuesday 
signed the motion from Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak recalling 
Marek Borowski from his post as finance minister, and the 
partners in the ruling coalition expressed their willingness to 
continue to work together. 
  Late on Tuesday, following a meeting between senior figures 
from the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) and Pawlaks Polish 
Peasant Party (PSL) at Warsaws Parkowa Hotel, both sides 
expressed their willingness to maintain the coalition for the 
full four-year term of the present parliament. The participants 
also stressed that their first priority was to see the 1994 
budget safely through parliament. 
  The meeting was closed to the press, but reporters noted 
among the participants: SLD leader Aleksander Kwasniewski, Sejm 
Speaker Jozef Oleksy, Justice Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz 
and Marek Borowski for the SLD - while for the PSL: Prime 
Minister Pawlak, PSL President Jozef Zych, Education Minister 
Aleksander Luczak, and Cabinet Office minister Michal Strak. 
  Earlier, following an hour-long meeting between Prime 
Minister Pawlak and Aleksander Kwasniewski, the SLD leader told 
the "Panorama" TV news bulletin that there was "little chance" 
of an agreement. However, Sejm speaker Jozef Oleksy told a 
late-night TV news bulletin that the coalition partners had 
agreed to compromise, out of a feeling of responsibility for the 
governance of the state. According to him, the main result of 
the meeting at the "Parkowa" Hotel had been an agreement to 
respect the terms of the coalition agreement between the SLD and 
the PSL. 
  Oleksy added that the SLD would be nominating a replacement 
for Borowski as finance minister, but declined to name any 
likely candidates. 
  Meanwhile, leading figures in the opposition parties 
declined 
to comment directly on the present crisis. The leader of the 
Democratic Union (UD) Tadeusz Mazowiecki ruled out the immediate 
possibility of UD participation in government. "I do not 
believe the UD will change its position on the political scene: 
That we need to build a lasting opposition." 
  Heart surgeon Zbigniew Religa, a senator and leader of the 
Non-Party Reform Bloc (BBWR), said that he believed the fall of 
the current ruling coalition would be advantageous for the BBWR. 
  Leszek Moczulski, leader of the Confederation for an 
Independent Poland (KPN), reiterated that the price for KPN 
involvement in any future coalition would be the exclusion of 
the post-communist Social-Democracy of the Republic of Poland 
(SDRP), the leading political force in the Democratic Left 
Alliance (SLD).

  [Text] Warsaw, Feb. 7 -- Polish Interior Minister Andrzej 
Milczanowski and his Russian counterpart Victor Yerin on Monday 
announced coordinated measures against organized crime. At a 
press conference that concluded Yerin's three-day visit to 
Poland, Milczanowski added that the Polish police is considering 
the purchase of Russian arms. 
  Both ministers said they want to intensify cooperation in 
combatting organized crime, especially drug smuggling. The 
scope of such cooperation is determined by the inter-ministerial 
agreement signed in November 1992, which was reviewed during 
Yerin's present visit. 
  Reporting on the possibility to carry out joint actions 
against organized crime, Milczanowski disclosed that during the 
coming month, the Russian Interior Ministry will make a 
catalogue of crimes associated with Russian citizens in Poland 
which will be made available to Polish policemen. A similar 
catalogue will be made by Polish police to help Russian law 
enforcement. 
  Russians were second (after Ukrainians) among foreigners 
suspected of committing crimes in Poland last year when their 
number reached 667. 
  Victor Yerin said that both countries are ready to exchange 
liaison officers but that the decisions must be made by both 
governments. Asked whether foreigners are safe in Russia he 
replied that "their security is guaranteed if they behave 
normally."

  [Text] Warsaw, Feb. 8 -- The National Democratic Party 
(SND) led by Jan Zamoyski on Tuesday signed a policy agreement 
with the right-wing coalition formed by the Real Politics Union 
(UPR), the Conservative Party (PK), the Peasant-Christian Party 
(SLCH) and the Party of Christian Democrats (PCHD). 
  Leaders of the five groupings stressed that the coalition is 
of a confederation character and that there are proper 
conditions at present to form a conservative and liberal camp, 
as time will act to the advantage of such a camp. 
  Leader of the Conservative Party Aleksander Hall said that 
the formation of such a camp will decide whether the Right in 
Poland will score a success. He stressed that his party is 
determined to form a strong right-wing centre in the coalition. 
  The SND was set up in April 1992. At present the party has 
about one thousand members.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 7/2/1994 -- Dumitru Paslaru, 
spokesman of the ruling party of Social Democracy of Romania 
(PDSR), said developments in the Republic of Moldova, the 
reconsideration of the stands of important political 
personalities there and their statements rendered delicate the 
continuation of the political relations and the rapprochement 
between Romania and that state. In an interview with ROMPRES, 
Paslaru added that the PDSR considered the statements made by 
Snegur [president of the Republic of Moldova] and Motpan 
[president of the Agrarian Democratic Party of Moldova] to be 
inciting, offending the Romanians everywhere, an attempt at the 
country's national integrity, an obvious disconsideration of 
public opinion of the Romanian majority in the present Republic 
of Moldova. "We however hope these statements are just a 
temporary element in the political climate of the Republic of 
Moldova. These statements should better not turn into ruling 
theses and the optimistic tone of our relations of so far should 
be resumed," the PDSR spokesman also said. 
  The Romanian National Unity Party [PUNR] Vice-President 
Cornel Brahas assesses as a mistake the fact that the Romanian 
authorities recognized officially "this shadow state in 
Romania's historical territory. It is an open attempt at our 
integrity and a tragical betrayal of the Romanian nation. No 
matter what eastern or western chancellories encouraged Snegur 
to assume this terrible burden, we must not give in to 
defeatism," Cornel Brahas said. 
  "I have not been taken by surprise by this statement made by 
Mr. Mircea Snegur, a good Romanian speaker but not an equally 
good Romanian. It was prepared by other political actions which 
we ignored when we did not encourage," said Professor Ion Coja, 
an outstanding member of the Agrarian Democratic Party of 
Romania (PDAR). "What's even worse is that, in a concerted 
manner, some sort of declaration of annexation of Romania's 
territory to the former USSR is also launched. It is high time 
that the president of Romania, the parliament and government 
took at long last a stand that should not be criticized by the 
future generations of Romanians on either bank of the Prut," 
Professor Ion Coja said. 
  "The National Council of Reintegration and the National 
Party 
of Reintegration have decided to `back' Mircea Snegur, 
organizing the participation in the referendum of the more than 
one million refugees or their descendants, either Romanians, 
Jews, Germans, Poles," said Mircea Druc, former prime minister 
of the Republic of Moldova, now president of the National Party 
of Reintegration. "A referendum of all those who were forced to 
leave their native land following the Soviet invasion. In a 
near future, we will convene also a world congress of all 
refugees because we too, want to be a part of `Snegur's people' 
summoned to the referendum," Mircea Druc said. 
  "Mircea Snegur has proved he has remained a cent [as 
received] percent communist and no longer thinks, even for a 
moment, that he is Romanian," said Ion Diaconescu, 
vice-president of the Christian Democratic National Peasant 
Party. 
  "For him, the notion of Romanian is completely subordinated 
to the political creed for which he has campaigned for a 
lifetime. His theses are communist, they were Stalin's as well 
and he keeps them because he grew up with them. 
  "Nobody imposes Romania's union with Bessarabia by force, 
but 
to go as far as declaring that Romanians and Moldovans are 
different peoples is a nonsense launched by communists which 
Mircea Snegur, as a truthful disciple, has adopted."

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 7/2/1994 -- "The statements made 
by Mircea Snegur [president of the Republic of Moldova] and 
Dumitru Motpan [president of the Agrarian Democratic Party of 
Moldova] were to us extremely surprising, extremely grave," said 
Adrian Nastase, speaker of the Chamber of Deputies of Romania's 
Parliament. "They prove that a dangerous policy is currently 
conducted in the Republic of Moldova, either for political 
reasons or because of pressure from elsewhere. An anti-Romanian 
policy comes to the fore, which we have mentioned before. We 
were contradicted then, were told that the anti-Romanian policy 
was not a policy deliberately conducted in Chisinau. Now, we 
see that in fact these things were being secretly articulated in 
the basements of the policy of the Republic of Moldova. I 
believe our brothers across the Prut will know how to adequately 
react to these shifted stresses and even changed road in the 
policy promoted by the leadership in Chisinau. As for 
ourselves, we will have to draw the necessary conclusions for 
the future as concerns those with whom we can develop important, 
constructive and efficient political links in the period ahead," 
the Chamber of Deputies speaker said.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 7/2/1994 -- Victor Surdu, 
president of the Democratic Agrarian Party of Romania [PDAR], 
said Snegur's and Motpan's [president of the Agrarian Democratic 
Party of Moldova] recent statements were actually "a carbon copy 
of the theses through which for many tragic decades the brothers 
across the Prut were kept under imperial boot, their rights to 
real national existence violated, their history and language 
ignored, in the name of hegemonic, dictatorial claims backed 
with criminal cynicism through the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact". 
  The Agrarian Democratic Party, its leader Victor Surdu said, 
"considers that through such statements that contradict the 
historical truths and the course of so far of the relations 
between Romania and the Republic of Moldova, whose independence 
our country was the first to recognize -- their authors oppose 
the natural course of history, commit themselves with fishy 
haste to a direction with unforeseeable ends. Their positions 
cannot be legitimated by any argument. Moreover, they advance 
dangerous ideas, disregard an independent, sovereign and unitary 
state like Romania. 
  "Through such statements, which the PDAR definitely rejects, 
their authors assume a serious responsibility before history and 
their own citizens so tragically tried by insane decisions made 
in the past. They claim rights they really do not have towards 
their destiny. And the territorial claims that result from the 
strange outlook on the union of the Republic of Moldova with a 
part of a neighbour and sovereign state disclose a grave 
departure even from the rational and realistic spirit, a 
worrying betrayal of history and of the real and essential 
interests of the Romanians across the Prut. 
  Hearing with surprise, sorrow and worry such statements, 
firmly rejecting them, the PDAR is sure that the truth will 
triumph, that future history will do justice to people so hard 
tried by fate, by foreign oppression, that the Romanians 
everywhere, just like their brave forefathers, will know how to 
defend their rights, faith, language and national being.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 8/2/1994 -- "An Arbitrary 
Differentiation That Defies Historical Truth" is the title under 
which the editorial of the daily newspaper DIMINEATA comments 
the recent statements made by the president of the Republic of 
Moldova, Mircea Snegur, relative to the existence of a "Moldovan 
people," allegedly different from the Romanian people. 
  As is known, the Republic of Moldova is inhabited by 64 
percent ethnic Romanians, speakers of a genuine albeit slightly 
archaic Romanian, and live on more than three quarters of what 
used to be the historical Romanian province of Bessarabia, 
annexed in 1940 by the former Soviet Union on the strength of 
the Soviet-German pact signed by the then foreign ministers 
Molotov and Ribbentrop. After the fall at the end of the ninth 
decade of the totalitarian regimes in the East of Europe, more 
and more voices in the Republic of Moldova proclaimed the return 
of this Romanian territory to its mother land Romania. 
  The editorial quoted above cautions that the reoccurrence in 
Snegur's declaration of older theses of the Soviet ideology 
periodically aired, first in the twenties and thirties, then in 
the forties and fifties and in the Brezhnev epoch, which 
advocate a clear distinction between the Romanian people and 
culture and the "Moldovan people and culture." 
  TINERETUL LIBER finds Snegur's attitude as a strategic 
response to Moscow's offensive attempts to regain its commanding 
role over its former republics, but finds no excuse for his 
impudence of "denying his own roots, and doing this on behalf of 
those he is representing." The newspaper terms Bucharest's 
reaction as "still pale" and warns that Romanian should not 
neglect the national interest and overlook the political 
significance and the emotional impact Snegur's statement carries. 
  Under the heading "Romanian Political Circles Vehemently 
Condemn Mircea Snegur's Switch" CURIERUL NATIONAL groups 
opinions by Romanian political forces on Mircea Snegur's 
statements. "Preposterous" is the label applied to them by 
Peasant Party [PNTCD] Vice President Ioan Diaconescu. The 
ruling Social Democracy Party of Romania (PDSR) finds them 
"inciting and offending," and Romanian National Unity Party 
(PUNR) Vice President Cornel Brahas qualifies them as "an overt 
attempt at our integrity, a tragical treason of the Romanian 
kin." 
  COTIDIANUL defines the lines of action against such 
aberrations in the following terms: "The awareness of the 
physical, spiritual and moral geography, the unharnessing of the 
Romanians' power to create, to give vigour and substance to the 
national idea through the opening toward the European spirit 
have become the commandments of our ties against the dangers 
springing from the rebirth of the Zhirinovskiy-type [Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] 
imperial nationalism and expansionism."

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 8/2/1994 -- Romanian Chief 
Diplomat Teodor Melescanu left on February 8 for Geneva to 
attend an informal meeting on February 9 of the co-presidents of 
the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, Lord 
David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, the foreign ministers of 
the states neighboring former Yugoslavia, of Turkey and Greece. 
Before departure, Teodor Melescanu highlighted in a news 
statement at the Otopeni Airport the new element of the meeting, 
as it had resulted from the Bucharest consultations with the two 
negotiators, namely a possible involvement of the countries 
neighboring the former Yugoslav area in the international 
efforts for seeking out a solution. The talks in Geneva, Teodor 
Melescanu said, will focus mainly on the latest solutions the 
two negotiators and the European Union are considering for 
stopping the conflict, on the support the neighbor countries can 
give and, maybe, on other issues associated with the prospect of 
settling the conflict. 
  "I think it is an attempt in good faith of the neighbor 
countries, Romania included, to contribute to ending this 
tragedy which has lasted far too much for everybody and which is 
already worrying all of us, not only those who live in the 
former Yugoslav space."

  [Text] Bratislava, Feb 8 (CTK) -- Slovak Prime Minister 
Vladimir Meciar will sign a general document on NATO's 
Partnership for Peace plan in Brussels on Wednesday [9 
February], Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik confirmed today. 
  Moravcik also reported that the government approved a bill 
on 
the principles of the provisional water management regime at the 
Danube hydroelectric power station at Gabcikovo-Nagymaros, on 
the Slovak- Hungarian border. The bill is based on reports 
compiled by an expert group from the European Union (EU) 
commission and the two states involved in construction, Slovakia 
and Hungary. He said the government favors the provisional 
water management regime, as the Slovak section of the commission 
recommended. 
  Slovakia proposes that, at the beginning of the vegetation 
phase, the Danube branch be flooded while the current flow in 
the old riverbed is preserved, he said. 
  Moravcik stressed Slovakia fully respected Hungarian fears 
that too little water would be left in the Danube on Hungarian 
territory and would implement concrete measures to prevent this 
from happening. He added that in approving the bill the Slovak 
Government was making no comment on the original 1977 agreement 
on the construction of the dam and that any agreement on the 
water management regime would be valid only until the 
International Court of Justice at The Hague, which is to settle 
the dispute between Slovakia and Hungary, delivers its judgment.

  [Text] Bratislava, Feb 8 (CTK) -- Anton Bodis, a spokesman 
for Slovak President Michal Kovac, rejected today allegations by 
Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar that Kovac had negotiated with 
representatives of the deputies' group of the Meciar-led 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), urging them to 
establish factions within the movement. 
  Bodis was reacting to press reports quoting Meciar as saying 
that "the president is leading consultations (on possible 
factions within the government coalition HZDS) with some 
parliamentary deputies, and recommends concrete alternatives." 
  Bodis said that Kovac last met with HZDS deputies at his 
meeting with all deputies' groups in the parliament late last 
year.

  [Text] Bratislava, February 6 (CTK) -- In a few days' time 
petitions should appear in the Slovak streets from the Movement 
for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) which needs to collect 350,000 
signatures in order to call a referendum on the filling of 
mandates in parliament, Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar announced 
on the "Kroky" television programme today. 
  In the referendum people would decide whether those deputies 
who have left the party on whose slate they were elected should 
leave parliament. 
  "The preliminary work is near to completion. Let people 
decide themselves who they want in parliament and who not," 
Meciar said, adding that "if a referendum does not provide a 
way out, early elections will be needed." 
  Opposition leaders Peter Weiss, Jan Carnogursky and Bela 
Bugar, however, see early elections as the first way out of the 
current parliamentary crisis which came to a head at the end of 
last week when some HZDS deputies walked out, thus preventing a 
crucial decision on the privatization of state property worth 
220 billion Slovakia korunas. 
  Before that, the HZDS' post-election majority had been 
eroded 
by the gradual departure of nine deputies from the party. A 
coalition with the Slovak National Party (SNS) proved of little 
help after six of the 14 SNS deputies broke away and have now 
effectively joined the opposition. 
  Meciar said today that the results of the last elections had 
to be respected. "Attempts to make Deputy Premier Roman Kovac 
and Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik out to be second Knazko 
(Milan Knazko, one of the departed HZDS deputies) are the affair 
of the media. There are no basic differences of opinion between 
me and Kovac," Meciar said, assuring there would be no further 
splits in the HZDS. 
  It has been speculated in the media that Kovac and Moravcik 
are considering creating a faction with the support of several 
HZDS deputies. 
  Chairman of Parliament Ivan Gasparovic said in a television 
debate that the parliamentary session would continue on February 
16. Meciar says however that the session will not take place 
unless the opposition allows Gasparovic to regain his 
constitutional authority in the direction of the session. Weiss 
has promised that the Democratic Left Party (SDL) will put 
forward a proposal for a solution to the crisis by February 16. 
  Most of today's television discussion was taken up by the 
amendment to the law on large privatization which parliament had 
been debating. The opposition calls for greater control over 
what the government and premier do in this area. As there is at 
present no privatization minister in Slovakia, the post is 
filled by Meciar, who is also Chairman of the National Property 
Fund (FNM). 
  Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party Jan Carnogursky 
said today that this joining of posts and the loss of 
parliamentary control over privatization would lead to "the 
corruption of public life," to the lowering of the value of 
state property, the slowing down of the privatization process 
and the stagnation of the Slovak economy. 
  Meciar rejected this accusation, and accused opposition 
politicians of having financial connections with 21 key 
joint-stock companies in which the FNM had called extraordinary 
plenary sessions with the aim of a change in statutes and a 
changes in their supervisory councils. 
  He also argued that the privatization process in south 
Slovakia was ruled by Hungarian capital. "There is at least 55 
percent Hungarian capital in nationally mixed areas, as much as 
68 percent," he said. 
  To this the chairman of the Hungarian Christian Democratic 
movement MKDH, Bela Bugar, said when the government is in a 
tight spot it pulls out the nationalist card.

  [Text] Bratislava, Feb 8 (CTK) -- Slovak Prime Minister 
Vladimir Meciar said that attempts to remove him as the leader 
of the government and of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
(HZDS) are aimed at causing the HZDS to split and thus allow the 
opposition political parties to fill in the space. 
  In an interview for today's Slovak government daily 
REPUBLIKA, the prime minister also accused President Michal 
Kovac of discussing the creation of factions in the governing 
HZDS. 
  The prime minister was reacting to considerations that the 
path towards the establishment of a broad government coalition, 
which Kovac urged in his New Year's speech, could open up with 
the HZDS's atomization and Meciar's dismissal from the posts he 
currently holds. 
  "The attack now being waged against me," said Meciar, "has a 
slightly different background than before. It is following a 
line that, in case of elections, the HZDS without Meciar would 
be a less dangerous partner or would not be dangerous at all. 
What is also being reckoned on is that a possible removal of 
the HZDS chairman would facilitate the creation of a number of 
factions. The split of the movement, which now represents a 
real political force, would in fact provide a space for the 
Democratic Left Party (SDL) or would help improve the position 
of the Christian democrats," Meciar said. 
  In his opinion, the creation of factions or the split of the 
HZDS parliamentary group cannot be initiated from the outside. 
"I am sorry," said Meciar, "that Mr. President (Kovac) is 
negotiating this issue with some deputies and recommending 
specific alternatives." At the same time, Meciar gave assurances 
that the HZDS is a viable and democratic institution, which 
"will decide what to do by itself." 
  Meciar also disagreed with "financial oligarchy" and 
"powerful money" replacing human values. "You can see that 
attacks against me are launched mainly from the circles of the 
nouveaux riches. It is no use to hide it. The contacts and 
links of many politicians to various interest groups are so 
big," said Meciar, "that I do not know whether they always act 
only out of their own will."

  [Text] Bratislava, Feb 5 (CTK) -- Egyutteles 
(Co-existence), a Hungarian minority movement in Slovakia, warns 
against "the installation of an open dictatorship" in connection 
with the current stalemate in parliament. 
  In a statement issued by the Egyutteles Parliamentary Group 
and given to CTK today, movement representatives said they 
considered the constant questioning of the legitimacy of 
parliament to be part of a dangerous scenario which could 
develop into establishing an open dictatorship. 
  The opposition movement voices the view that the current 
Slovak Government was incapable of stopping the economic fall of 
society and of finding a way out of the accumulated tension. By 
the lack of will to create a functioning government coalition 
the ruling Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) could 
create a permanent governmental and parliamentary crisis. The 
government lacks a concept for the transformation of society and 
a strategy of economic and social policy. That is why it is 
resorting to ever more arrogant methods to maintain and 
concentrate power, the statement says.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 8 (CTK) -- Slovak and German Defense 
Ministers Volker Ruhe and Imrich Andrejcak signed an agreement 
on military cooperation between the countries. 
  This year 25 joint operations on the territory of the two 
states will take place, Ruhe told journalists. "Usually this 
sort of event is staged only in the second or third year of 
cooperation. This illustrates the accelerated contacts between 
the two countries' armed forces," he added. 
  The ministers are proposing an exchange of experts, not 
units 
or joint maneuvers. The general staffs are to discuss the 
exchange of units, Andrejcak said. Ruhe said that Slovak and 
German troops would probably first meet in Poland to where they 
had been invited. 
  The Slovak Army will consult Bundeswehr experts regarding 
the 
creation of a task force brigade.

  [Text] Prishtina, February 7 (ATA) -- The representative 
of the delegation of the Norwegian Parliament, which visited 
Kosova recently, Mr. Eric Stolheim, after his meetings with the 
leaders of the Democratic League of Kosova, held a meeting with 
journalists. 
  Considering the talking held in Belgrade, Mr. Stolheim said 
that "our talking in Belgrade were concentrated on the Serbian 
views for the situation in Kosova and what we were told there is 
not something unexpected for you because their official attitude 
toward Kosova is that it is a natural part of Serbia and it will 
be this one for ever." 
  Later on, he said, our talking were concentrated in the 
Albanian's position and in the great matters of the independence 
of Kosova as well as in the protection of the human rights and 
freedoms in Kosova and the right of the Albanians for 
non-investigation by the Serbian police. 
  Mr. Stolheim said that they have talked also about the fate 
of the Albanian refugees turned back by Norway because there are 
evidences that these people are being maltreated by the Serbian 
police and their human rights are not respected. This is an 
important part of the present debates in Scandinavia, he said. 
  Asked about his trust to the words of the minister for the 
minorities in rump Yugoslavia, Mrs. Margaret Savovic, 
considering the investigation by the Serbian police of the 
Albanian refugees turned back from Norway and other countries, 
the Norwegian parliamentary man said "No." [sentence as received]

  [Text] Tirana, February 6 (ATA) -- Serbian financial 
police has recently undertaken an extensive control which is 
mostly aimed at the Albanian traders, who are not only fined 
with large sums of money but they are also forced to close down 
their shops. 
  Serbian civil policemen provoked Albanian traders and under 
the pretext of non-observation of new monetary measures to help 
dinar which is going bankrupt, order the closure of their shops. 
As a result of these measures, 35 shops have been closed until 
now in Mitrovice, five in Serbice. During the past 15 days 
alone, the daily Serbian newspaper JEDINSTVO, published in 
Prishtina, writes 70 Albanian private shops have been closed in 
the regions which are called "Circle of Kosova."

  [Text] Tirana, February 8 (ATA) -- In the recent press 
conference held in Prishtina, Professor Doc. Rexhep Ismajli, 
member of the Presidency of the Democratic League of Kosova 
(DLK), noted among others that the census of the Albanians in 
Macedonia will present serious problems and it will be hindered 
by the Macedonian authorities. These impediments will affect on 
a 30 per cent reduction in the number of Albanians "in this 
Macedonia," he said. We can not comprehend the fact that the 
authorities make the receiving of the citizenship dependent on a 
15 years living in Macedonia when it is well known that in the 
ex-Yugoslavia Federation the citizens could live wherever they 
wanted and they could receive the citizenship of the country 
where they lived, Mr. Ismajli said. In introducing the new legal 
dispositions about the citizenship in Macedonia, the Macedonian 
authorities aim to reduce the number of Albanians in Macedonia 
and to present them as a national minority. 
  Many Albanians from Macedonia live presently in Kosova but 
they were born and lived for over 20 years in Macedonia and they 
have actually their families and real estates there. The 
Macedonian law excludes these citizens from the right to receive 
citizenship and from other rights of the Macedonian state. 
There are many cases when Kosovars married in Macedonia and who 
have created their own families and live there for over 40 years 
can't receive the Macedonian citizenship, "America Voice" Radio 
[Voice of America] said on February 6. 
  But Macedonians living in Macedonia and in other foreign 
countries can easily receive the Macedonian citizenship. About 
30 per cent of the Albanian population in Macedonia do not 
possess passports issued after April 1 of last year because of 
the above problems but this will be the basic condition to 
participate in that census. Even if they accomplish all the 
conditions required for receiving citizenship during the 
administrative procedures they will be unable to secure the new 
passports up to April 1, 1994, the date of the beginning of the 
census. According to estimates, also during this census there 
will be evidenced 30 per cent less Albanians actually living in 
Macedonia despite of the fact that international observers can 
participate in this event.

  [Text] Prpsc (ATA) -- Behlul Jashari writes: According to 
a special Serbian decision, the exit visas for the Albanians 
wanting to go to Albania have been received only for going to 
this country. This decision is strictly applied and those who 
return to Kosova are fined, punished with 30 days imprisonment 
or are taken their passports for three years. In conformity 
with the decision, passports were taken from thousands of 
Albanians who travelled to Albania through Macedonia or Greece. 
  It is difficult for the Albanians of Kosova to get visas for 
Albania. Those who ask for visas have been maltreated and asked 
to collaborate with police. That is why there are very few 
requests for visas. 
  The Serbian authorities hinder all kinds of communication 
between the Albanians in Kosova and the Albanians in Albania. 
In many areas of Kosova, Serbian authorities have put jamming 
devices in order to impend the transmission of the Albanian 
radio-television programs. The devices are under the control of 
the Serbian police and army. The exchange of artistic, 
scientific and cultural values is also prohibited. The 
University and National Library of Kosova, the Academy of 
Sciences and Arts, the Albanological Institution and other 
institutions in Kosova can not receive any publications from 
Albania. 
  The Serbian police punishes the persons who keep a book or a 
newspaper from Albania. The wall between Albania and Kosova is 
so impassable that there are no telephone links with Albania. 
  Although the Albanians in Kosova live in an ethnic compact 
territory, their mother-land Albania is very far away.

  [Markov] Today, 9 February, the National Assembly conducted 
a secret vote on the proposal to vote on confidence in the 
cabinet in connection with the failure of the cabinet to 
implement its duties regarding the citizens' security and the 
public law and order. The no-confidence vote was proposed on 28 
January by the parliamentary faction of the Union of Democratic 
Forces [SDS]. 
  A commission composed by Khristo Markov, Ruslan Semerdzhiev, 
Mariela Miteva, and Kiril Zhelev announces the following results 
of the no-confidence vote: 
  Some 228 National Assembly members took part in the vote. 
Some 89 ballots were cast in support of the no-confidence vote. 
Some 135 ballots were cast against the no-confidence proposal. 
Three envelopes were found empty, and one contained more than 
one ballot. 
  On the basis of the voting results, and on Article 81, 
Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Bulgarian Constitution, and Paragraph 
4 of the additional instructions on the activity of the National 
Assembly, the no-confidence vote in the cabinet has been 
rejected.

<F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Zhukov] </F>
  [Text] A responsible customs officer has informed 
KONTINENT that the Ruse customs will be swamped with Romanian 
gasoline. At its meeting on Thursday 3 February the government 
hid the real reason for the temporary ban on importing vehicle 
gasoline, aviation fuel, and gas for lamps. The true reason is 
the immense import of fuels across the Danube Bridge. 
  Yesterday morning alone, the customs authorities detained 96 
Romanian fuel tanker vehicles. According to a source in the 
Ministry of Trade, the border and customs authorities in 
Dragoman are no longer in a position to say no to the mafia, 
which is threatening their lives if they refuse to let the 
tankers through to Yugoslavia. 
  A police source declared that the state apparatus is not 
functioning, and only a complete ban can stop the flow of fuel 
to Belgrade. 
  Until the new excise duty tariff takes effect, the duty on 
liquid fuels is negligible, as compared with the huge profits of 
250 to 300 percent that can be gained in embargo-stricken 
Yugoslavia. 
  At the moment the excise duty is 60 percent on A-96 and A-98 
gasolines, and 50 percent on the A-86 and A-93 grades. A 
special police officer said that the Bulgarian mafia is stepping 
up its attempts to send fuel through the Dragoman border 
checkpoint because the Romanian and Hungarian mafias cannot wait. 
  The possibility cannot be excluded that the gasolines 
shipped 
through Ruse from Romania have actually been processed at the 
Neftokhim refinery in Burgas, because the Romanians insist on 
marketing their own petroleum abroad themselves. 
  The economic police are unable to check on the amounts of 
gasoline entering the country to establish whether it is 
destined for domestic consumption, whether it is stored in the 
huge tank parks of the state Petroleum Company, or whether it 
leaves the country again in Bulgarian railroad tankers.

<F P=106> [Plamen Enchev commentary: "How To Exploit the Embargo"] </F>
  [Text] As was recently announced, an entire train loaded 
with oil barrels is supposed to have crossed the border with 
Serbia undisturbed. Yesterday, a company tried to export 
ammonium nitrate by declaring it as a detergent. Chemical 
experts, however, claim that the substance can be used as a raw 
material for making gunpowder. 
  The idea of the embargo against Serbia and Montenegro was 
conceived by the UN for the purpose of subjecting the remaining 
part of Yugoslavia to economic sanctions because of the war it 
is waging in Bosnia. 
  Only future historians can assess whether this is an 
appropriate action. The UN member countries, however, are 
obliged to observe the embargo as long as it is in force. 
Special organs in charge of supervising the observance of the 
Yugo-sanctions were established. 
  All these reflections lead to the legitimate question of how 
the different countries are observing the embargo. Has anyone 
heard from the Western mass media or read in their newspapers 
about Romania, Hungary, or Greece, for example, violating the UN 
sanction measures? No. However, the opposite is true in the 
case of our country. World-reknowned papers, magazines, and 
news agencies are openly declaring that something is happening 
at the Kalotina border checkpoint. 
  The other day REUTER filed a rather scary correspondent's 
report from Sofia about threats to which the international teams 
in charge of supervising the observance of the sanctions by our 
country are allegedly subject. One of the observers even 
disclosed that, until recently, as many as 80 vans per day 
exported gasoline to Serbia without being disturbed by Bulgarian 
customs officials. 
  We officially declare to the world that our country is 
strictly observing the UN sanctions. Other neighbor countries 
of former Yugoslavia are claiming the same. 
  The truth is hardly likely to transpire in the near future. 
Some people are estimating its value in human lives, rather 
than in banknotes. 
  The question is whether anyone in our country is ready to 
declare that whoever violates the embargo shall be held 
responsible. In the opposite case, someone might think that 
busting the embargo is our state policy, which would not be so 
bad, if it was true. Nevertheless, we have some doubts about it.

Liquidating the Bulgarian Army"] 
  [Text] The government's draft budget dooms the army to a 
slow death, the deputies of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] 
in the parliamentary National Security Commission think. They 
point out with concern that the 12 billion leva envisaged for 
this year will hardly cover the most urgent needs of the 
Bulgarian Army. "Rapidly growing inflation will eat into a 
significant part of this meager sum," a SDS deputy told 
DEMOKRATSIYA. "It must be remembered that at least 3 billion 
leva will go on last year's expenditure." 
  The situation is especially grave in the Air Force and the 
Navy. As Vice-Admiral Ventseslav Velkov, Navy commander, 
recently said, "70-80 percent of our warships are hopelessly 
obsolete." A high-ranking air force officer said with alarm 
that the the spare part situation for warplanes is desperate. 
  The situation of the ground troops is no better. Not only 
are there insufficient means for the army's equipment and 
training, but on top of this the budget envisages humiliatingly 
meager wages for the officers and sergeants. Battalion 
commanders will receive wages lower than those of the cleaning 
ladies in some private companies. 
  The Bulgarian Army's troubles do not end with the budget. 
New dismissals of capable officers are imminent, while at the 
same time people who implement the political orders of the 
present leadership are being promoted to command positions. 
Many officers think that the Army is again being deliberately 
politicized, even before the process of decommunization has 
ended. Reports confirm that the functions of the former State 
Security Third Administration, so much hated in the past by the 
officers, are being seized by Brigo Asparukhov's service. The 
Foreign Political Intelligence Service has already publicized 
its control over the General Staff and the civilian leadership 
of the Ministry of Defense.

<F P=106> [Interview with Medhmed Hodzha, deputy for the Rights and </F>
Freedoms Movement, DPS, by Mira Stefanova and Nataliya Vuchkova; 
place and date not given: "Mehmed Hodzha: DPS Is Full of 
Informants"] 
  [Text] [KONTINENT] Mr. Khodzha, why did you leave the DPS 
Parliamentary Group at this very moment? 
  [Hodzha] I was certainly not prompted by any emotional 
reasons. My doubts started as early as in late 1992. I was 
restrained by the concern about the DPS unity and about 
preventing the DPS constituents from learning about our 
disagreements, about the processes underway in our parliamentary 
group and in the Central Council. I very seriously objected to 
the developments in late 1992, when Mr. Stefan Savov was 
overthrown from the post of parliamentary chairman. I still do 
not understand why all this happened. The same applies to the 
subsequent events with the fall of Filip Dimitrov's government 
and the efforts to form a cabinet under Yordan Sokolov. As 
early as at that time I suspected my party's leadership of 
biased intentions. I had the feeling that all their actions 
were inspired by exterior forces, that it was not the wish of 
our constituents they were following, and that all these 
developments did not serve the people's interests. Naturally, 
the DPS Parliamentary Group and the Central Council found very 
convenient motives to explain the situation to their 
constituents, pretending that all their actions were aimed at 
solving the people's socioeconomic problems. 
  [KONTINENT] Mr. Hodzha, what makes you so sure that your 
misgivings and forebodings about such biased actions have 
already been confirmed? 
  [Hodzha] The DPS Central Council and the Parliamentary Group 
had decided that a bill or a draft resolution on disclosing 
personal police files should be moved as soon as possible, or in 
case another parliamentary group should submit such a proposal, 
our group would support it. Nevertheless, our leadership and 
its entourage did not support the draft resolution in question 
when it was submitted. 
  [KONTINENT] Do any former police informants exist among the 
DPS members? 
  [Hodzha] They definitely exist. A leading member of 
parliamentary group had the insolence and arrogance of proposing 
to the group that we should support the nomination of Filip 
Bokov [from the Bulgarian Socialist Party] as head of the 
Bulgarian delegation to the European Parliamentary Assembly. 
This was a question of principle for us. It could have been 
our second great blunder. It was prevented with great efforts. 
  I am genuinely concerned about the negligent attitude of our 
DPS Parliamentary Group leadership, about its unwillingness to 
visit the areas of our constituents. In the community of 
Dzhebel, in part of the Krumovgrad, Ardino, and Kirkovo 
communities, even not one kg of the "Basma" tobacco variety has 
been purchased. last week a telegram was dispatched to all 
members of parliament from the Kurdzhali election district, with 
copies of the letter to the National Assembly Presidium and the 
Council of Ministers, asking for their presence at a meeting 
scheduled to take place on Saturday [29 February]. No one 
attended the meeting. What does it mean? It means a total lack 
of responsibility whatsoever toward the electorate. The excuse 
of one of our Parliamentary Group leaders was it would have been 
our duty to pass a bill on tobacco growing and processing and to 
force the government and the Bulgartabak Company to set a 
minimum purchasing price. However, much more than that is at 
stake. The existence of a whole economic branch and the 
survival of numerous human beings are at stake, as a matter of 
fact. 
  [KONTINENT] Would you return to parliament after the next 
elections as a deputy of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS], 
for example? 
  [Hodzha] It depends on the local people, namely on the 
constituents. I am not the one to decide. If people, 
regardless of their ethnic origins, think that I would be 
eligible on the basis of my behavior and my actions, on the 
basis of my stand, if they become convinced that I am capable of 
defending their interests, I would not decline such a proposal. 
Naturally, I leave everything to them. I would not have the 
courage to appear before those people and try through mediators, 
or through hired persons, to persuade them that they should put 
my name on the list of candidates for the next elections. 
  [KONTINENT] Whose interests is the current DPS leadership 
serving in your view? 
  [Hodzha] They are serving alien interests, under all 
circumstances. I understand their dilemma. They are really 
under severe pressure, but in what case can someone be subject 
to pressure and blackmail? It can only be done with something 
stronger than a police file. Those people are trained [by 
Communists], and they would not get the permission of certain 
agencies outside the DPS to do something more for democracy. 
They are simply not free to do so. 
  If I had been a traitor and an informant, if I had really 
worked against my fellow villagers, I would not hold my present 
position, because no one would have elected me. However, there 
is something much more serious at stake. The DPS leadership is 
just following somebody's secret instructions. Such leaders 
cannot be free and they cannot possibly act in the interest of 
their constituents.

<F P=106> [Report by Tihomir Vinkovic from Geneva] </F>
  [Text] Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and 
minister of foreign affairs, and Bosnian Prime Minister Haris 
Silajdzic ended their first round of talks at about 1300. Their 
tete-a-tete meeting took place in a constructive atmosphere at 
the Richmond hotel. The two ministers came to the conclusion 
that the hostilities between Croats and Muslims in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina must end immediately. Future relations will 
be determined on the basis of an agreement. 
  The future status of Muslim and Croat people in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina appears to be controversial. Proposals have 
ranged from the organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina along 
cantonal lines to the setting up of republics within a 
Bosnia-Herzegovina federation. 
  The talks, according to reports, were the first to be held 
in 
a completely frank atmospohere and could form a basis for a 
solution. 
  Croatian Minister Granic explained the features and basic 
guidelines of the Croatian-FRY statement on the normalization of 
relations: It deals exclusively with humanitarian issues and 
those connected with communications and is in no way targeted 
against Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The negotiating circles say that the international community 
as well as influential countries have been putting pressure on 
both sides to reach an agreement. The talks held so far appear 
to have taken this course. 
  Minister Granic will this afternoon meet the Austrian and 
Romanian foreign ministers who are attending the talks between 
Cochairmen Owen and Stoltenberg and representatives from the 
countries neighboring the former Yugoslavia. He is also 
expected to meet Silajdzic once again late this evening.

<F P=106> [Report by Tihomir Vinkovic from Geneva] </F>
  [Excerpt] In his talks with Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime 
Minister Haris Silajdzic and Austrian Foreign Minister Mock in 
Geneva today, Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and 
minister of foreign affairs, presented the Croatian standpoint 
on the possible future of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  A union of republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina would consist of 
three republics in which one of the three constituent nations 
would be in the majority. Minority rights in each of the 
republics in the union would be guaranteed and supervised by the 
international community. In areas where they make up a compact 
body, the minorities could be organized in areas with a certain 
degree of autonomy. In case the union of republics of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina disintegrates, each republic would have to 
guarantee the same minority rights as is envisaged for the union. 
  The Croatian view is identical to the EU proposal, known as 
the Kinkel-Juppe plan. Croatia again reiterated its proposal 
that the international community should supervise the border 
between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and carry out inspection 
of military formations. Of course, all hostilities must first 
cease. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Geneva, Feb 9 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic arrived here Wednesday [9 February] for talks 
with the other two warring parties, amid a growing threat of 
NATO air strikes against his faction. 
  Karadzic was enigmatic as he arrived here, declining all 
comment other than saying "I am only prepared to talk about the 
massacre in Sarajevo" which killed 68 people on Saturday [5 
February]. 
  The new round of talks due Thursday [10 February] has been 
scheduled for weeks, well before the massacre in a Sarajevo 
market place which has sparked intense international pressure 
for air strikes. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Geneva, Feb 10 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb leader Radovan 
Karadzic said here Thursday [10 February] he would not take part 
in peace talks until the massacre last Saturday in Sarajevo was 
properly investigated to determine who was responsible. He 
spoke as he was entering the talks here, and said he would tell 
the Bosnian and Croatian delegations his conditions for 
proceeding. 
  Karadzic looked drawn as he entered the UN headquarters. The 
Bosnian Serbs were threatened Wednesday with NATO air strikes if 
they do not withdraw their heavy artillery from around Sarajevo 
by February 21. 
  "I just want to say that we are not going to go on with the 
conference until we get an international investigatory body to 
investigate and resolve the Sarajevo massacre," Karadzic told 
reporters as he went in for talks with mainly Moslem Bosnian 
Government and Bosnian Croat delegations. 
  UN forces in Sarajevo have said a bombing Friday in Sarajevo 
that killed eight people was carried out by Serb artillery but 
have not determined who was responsible for the Saturday attack 
in a Sarajevo market that left 68 dead and aroused the ire of 
the international community. 
  "I would remind you that Moslems have stage-managed the 
killing in the bread queue killing 18 of their own people," he 
said, referring to a previous civilian bombing in Sarajevo for 
which the Moslems and Serbs each blame each other. He also said 
the Moslems were responsible for shooting down an Italian plane 
in September 1992. 
  Karadzic said the problem was that only Yugoslavia "got 
sanctions" after these incidents. "We don't have any reason to 
go on with the conference until we get a commission to 
investigate evidence in single circumstances and to say publicly 
who is responsible for this massacre," Karadzic said. 
  He said he would tell the Bosnian and Croatian delegations: 
"We are going to tell them we demand an investigatory body to 
get findings and to make this public."

  [Text] Geneva, Feb 10 (TANJUG) -- Co-Chairman of the 
International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, Lord Owen on 
Thursday said he believed chances were good that the agreement 
on a ceasefire and the withdrawal of artillery from positions 
around Sarajevo and its placing under the control of U.N. 
peace-keepers would be honoured. 
  Bosnian Serb and Muslim military representatives on 
Wednesday 
reached a ceasefire agreement through the mediation of U.N. 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR) Commander for the Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, General Michael Rose. The 
ceasefire agreement is to go into effect at noon on Thursday. 
The two sides also agreed to place their artillery weapons 
under UNPROFOR control while the ceasefire agreement is in force. 
  Lord Owen said the NATO ultimatum for Serbs to pull back 
their artillery to lines 20 kilometers from the centre of 
Sarajevo or else air strikes against them would be launched had 
had a strong impact on the Serbs. 
  Owen said in a statement to BBC Radio he hoped that, at the 
next round of the peace talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina, opening on 
Thursday afternoon, the parties would reach agreement to appoint 
a U.N. administrator-designate for Sarajevo in preparation for 
the city's demilitarization.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Tihomir Vinkovic from Geneva] </F>
  [Text] There has been no progress in the negotiations on 
the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina. At a plenary session presided 
over by peace mediators Owen and Stoltenberg, the Bosnian Serbs 
demanded that an international commission for establishing the 
crime at the Sarajevo marketplace should include both Serb and 
Muslim representatives. The Muslims refused, saying that the 
perpetrators, who they are convinced are the Serbs, could not 
take part in the investigation of the crime. 
  Owen and Stoltenberg are trying to salvage the negotiations. 
The mandate of the Geneva conference are peace negotiations, 
not individual cases. This is a task for UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces], Lord Owen says. The basis for the Geneva 
negotiations on the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina is a European 
Union plan. Croatia accepts this plan, Croatian Foreign Affairs 
Minister Mate Granic clearly said. Croatia, as well as a Croat 
delegation from Bosnia-Herzegovina, led by Mile Akmadzic, 
proposes international supervision of borders between Croatia 
and Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Croats also propose inspection of 
military formations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, through which Muslim 
allegations that the regular Army of the Republic of Croatia is 
fighting within the ranks of the Bosnian Croats would be denied. 
  The Croat delegation urges that an international commission 
should investigate last week's crime at the Sarajevo 
marketplace, but negotiations ought to be continued. The Croats 
also agree with the establishment of hot lines as a 
trust-building measure and the exchange of representatives of 
the three nations, as proposed by Owen and Stoltenberg. While I 
am reporting, there is a break in the plenary session, the 
resumption of which is expected soon.

<F P=106> [Article by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus: "Europe Viewed </F>
From the Perspective of the Meeting in Davos"] 
  [Text] One of the important topics on the agenda of the 
World Economic Forum in Davos was Europe -- its current 
situation, its so-called "expansion," and its future. I must 
admit that I had to protest a little against the views regarding 
Europe's expansion, because I am convinced that Europe can never 
be expanded (or even made smaller) by anyone. Europe is Europe 
regardless of the kind of institutions established in it, and 
views about its expansion can only be contemplated in relation 
to individual European institutions or organizations. In a 
panel discussion involving the Belgian, Danish, Finnish, and 
Czech prime ministers, it became obvious that this difference is 
very important and that we are the ones who always point it out. 
Finnish Prime Minister Aho played into my hands by quoting the 
famous Finnish composer Sibelius, thus enabling me to reply that 
Sibelius was not only a Finnish composer, but also -- 
undoubtedly -- a European one, without being recognized as such 
by some European institutions. The topic of many discussions 
was the future of Europe and its position in the world. 
  Our experience tells us that the success (or failure) of 
Europe -- and, in fact, of all of us -- does not so much depend 
on the existence, scope, and activities of multilateral European 
institutions, but that it depends far more on the type and 
structure of the political, social, and economic system that 
exists in European countries. We know very well that the reason 
for our own failure to keep pace with Western Europe and our 
rather unhappy life during the past four decades was not the 
existence of an institution like the Council for Mutual Economic 
Assistance, but the existence of the communist regime. The 
symmetric opposite also applies: The success of Western Europe 
did not depend on European Community institutions, but on a free 
society, private ownership, and a free market. This was not 
only valid in the past, it is also valid for today and tomorrow. 
  It is being decided right now whether Eastern Europe will 
uphold such a system or whether it will allow it to degenerate 
into a new form of collectivism endorsed under the banner of 
this or that old- new salvation-bringing "ism." The success of 
Europe depends on the extent of individual freedom; the extent 
of the free market and trade; the ability to get rid of 
unnecessary state interference in people's lives and their 
economic activities; curbing bureaucratic manipulation with 
everyone and everything; our determination and courage to limit 
the influence of the powerful and the social well being of lobby 
groups; and our ability to put in order the basic economic 
attributes, especially our handling of the reward we get for 
them. 
  In this context and under these circumstances, it is 
necessary to specify carefully the conditions for the possible 
favorable impact of multilateral European institutions on our 
future. I am concerned that the careful formulation of these 
conditions is being forgotten due to the simplified and a priori 
accepted argument that, without a united Europe, we will be 
"small," "weak," and "unable to stand up to competition" with 
the world's other regions. The favorable impact of these 
institutions, however, depends on the following: 
  1. Whether these pan-European institutions are greater 
advocates of the free market and free trade and greater 
opponents of state interventionism, bureaucracy, and lobbying 
than individual European states; 
  2. Whether the institutionalized, organized integration of 
Europe produces "bulk savings," or whether the rewards from the 
size of the regions would be higher than the losses associated 
with the functioning of too-widespread organizations; 
  3. Whether the idea of a unified, institutionally united 
Europe is in the real interests of Europe's citizens and not 
just in the interests of European politicians of a particular 
ideological persuasion, as is the case at the moment. 
  Patiently seeking (and empirically verifying) the answers to 
these questions has nothing whatsoever to do with nationalism 
(or internationalism), egoism (or altruism), or not seeing 
further than one's own nose (or adopting a broader view and 
perspective) as is often cast up -- in an oversimplified manner 
-- on certain people in our country and abroad. 
  The Czech Republic proceeds from the hypothesis that the 
Czech lands were always part of Europe and, therefore, that they 
do not want to be deprived of all the advantages stemming from 
membership in European institutions. I firmly believe that we 
have already crossed the Rubicon dividing the two totally 
different social systems, that we deserve to be taken seriously, 
and that we are prepared for further steps toward European 
integration. If I say integration, it is because I do not want 
to say unification or association, which are altogether 
different processes. 
  We want to be an "equal partner" that does not just want to 
get or acquire something, we are also prepared to give. We know 
we have to resolve our problems ourselves and, therefore, we are 
not asking anyone to resolve them for us. We believe that the 
current form of the European integration process is not the 
final one, and we would like to participate in the never-ending 
process of seeking the most ideal form for it. We realize that 
our communist past enables us to see some things more clearly 
than the countries of Western Europe, which did not have this 
past. This was a great blessing for them, but it is our duty to 
constantly point out some of the stumbling blocks. We believe 
that we will be listened to.

<F P=106> [Matthias Rueb report: "The Central European States Will Be </F>
Successful Together or Fail Together"] 
  [Text] Budapest, 8 February -- Hungarian Foreign Minister 
Geza Jeszenszky is trying to smooth down the waves that were 
caused by his official visit to Belgrade from 27 to 29 January 
this year. There, Jeszenszky had met, among others, "Yugoslav" 
Foreign Minister Jovanovic, Serbian President Milosevic, and 
representatives of the opposition parties. Agoston, chairman of 
the Democratic Union of Vojvodina Hungarians (VMDK), had 
participated in the talks with Milosevic and Jeszenszky. In an 
interview with this newspaper before his departure to Brussels, 
where he signed the "Partnership for Peace" agreement with NATO 
on Tuesday, Jeszenszky expressed his surprise at the light in 
which his meeting with the political leaders of the southern 
neighboring country is now being presented. It is not true that 
Hungary agreed with Serbia on main points. The Hungarian 
foreign minister was particularly furious about a WASHINGTON 
POST report that the attempt at the normalization of 
Serbian-Hungarian relations that had been made by Budapest is 
endangering the observation of the sanctions imposed by the 
United Nations against Serbia and Montenegro. 
  Jeszenszky affirmed Budapest's point of view, which had 
already been stated in Belgrade, that Hungary is supporting the 
lifting of the sanctions if "Yugoslavia" succeeds in again 
winning the favor of the community of states by its actions. By 
that time, which is hopefully not too far off, Hungary will, of 
course, fulfill its commitments toward the United Nations and 
other international organizations. Hungary has always strictly 
watched over the observation of the sanctions at its borders, he 
said. (In fact, representatives of the commissions of the 
European Union (EU) for the observation of the embargo have 
always praised the cooperation with the Hungarian authorities.) 
Although his country suffered an economic damage of about 2.5 
billion German marks because of the sanctions, Hungary will 
stick to the exact controls at the checkpoints with Serbia. 
However, it is equally evident that Hungary must not wait 
unprepared for the lifting of the sanctions, he said. 
Jeszenszky protested against the assumption that Hungary might 
have promised the government in Belgrade that the sanctions will 
be loosened in exchange for granting limited autonomy to the 
Hungarian minority in Vojvodina, which belongs to Serbia. "Such 
a deal does not exist," Jeszenszky said. 
  He carefully chose the date of his visit to Belgrade 
because, 
in the weeks before, a turnabout of the government in Belgrade 
had been perceptible -- that is, regarding the 400,000 
Hungarians in Vojvodina, as well as the demands of the community 
of states. Hungary is supporting the Kinkel-Juppe plan of the 
European Union, which provides for the gradual loosening of the 
sanctions in exchange for concessions of the Serbs in the peace 
negotiations on Bosnia-Herzegovina. Nobody will be able to 
reproach his country for striving for cooperation with Serbia, 
for example, in the combating of crime, and for seeking a 
dialogue with Serbian authorities, so that the passage of 
Hungarian ships on the Danube across Serbia is no longer impeded 
by illegal blockades by Serbian nationalists, he said. The 
Hungarian foreign minister is aware that only time will show 
whether the Serbian president's good words will also be followed 
by action. Not only since the latest massacre in Sarajevo has 
he viewed the relations with Serbia with skepticism and 
refrained from any naive hopes, he said. 
  Hungary unreservedly accepts NATO's offer of a Partnership 
for Peace. In the Hungarian foreign minister's opinion, this 
concept opens up two opportunities: On the one hand, if offers 
Russia the opportunity to get closer to NATO, while, on the 
other, it makes allowance for the fact that Russia's domestic 
policy might develop in a wrong direction. Central Europe 
rightly attaches central importance to the Partnership for 
Peace; it is not a policy of weakness that shows too much 
consideration for Russia. Apparently, the conviction that one 
cannot be successful in pushing through democracy and the market 
economy in Russia, without having previously pushed through 
democracy and the market economy in Central Europe is shared in 
Brussels, he said. The Hungarian foreign minister advocates the 
theory that democracy and the market economy are gradually 
advancing from the West to the East. Jeszenszky does not believe 
that NATO will demand from Hungary that its military expenditure 
of currently 2 percent of its gross national product has to be 
increased soon to 4 to 5 percent, which is usual in the NATO 
states. "The Partnership for Peace is not a program that 
involves high costs, but it can contribute to the modernization 
and restructuring of the armed forces of the Central European 
states with a relatively small financial expenditure," 
Jeszenszky said. 
  Regarding Hungary's integration into the European Union, it 
has meanwhile been shown that the opinion voiced, for example, 
by Chancellor Kohl in 1990, that is, that Hungary could become a 
full member in five to six years, was due to the generally 
hopeful mood at that time. Today one has to see that full EU 
membership -- the association agreement with Hungary came into 
force on 2 February this year -- has to be expected to take a 
longer time, approximately until the end of this century. In 
view of the security risks in Central Europe, it is a logical 
development that the West has above all accelerated security 
policy integration. Therefore, it is likely that it will be 
easier for Hungary and its Central European partners to be 
admitted to NATO and the Western European Union than to the 
European Union. 
  For Jeszenszky, Hungary and Poland have been the driving 
forces of the states of the so-called Visegrad Group right from 
the beginning. The Hungarian foreign minister deplored that the 
Czech Republic and Slovakia are pursuing cooperation with their 
Visegrad partners, Poland and Hungary, with only little 
enthusiasm. "Central Europe will be jointly successful or 
jointly fail," Jeszenszky said. Those in Prague who believe that 
a special road to NATO or the European Union can be taken is 
wrong. Jeszenszky advocated the revival of cooperation both in 
the Visegrad Group and the Central European Initiative [CEI]. 
The CEI, to which Italy, Slovenia, Austria, Hungary, Poland, 
the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia, Macedonia, and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina belong today, developed from a small alliance 
of Central European states, the so-called Pentagonal. For the 
Hungarian foreign minister it was a disappointment to see the 
former Czechoslovakia increasingly withdraw from the CEI after 
rather enthusiastic cooperation at the beginning. Because of 
the war in the former Yugoslavia and the unstable situation in 
Italy, the CEI had to limit itself to modest objectives and 
little significant statements for the time being, he said. 
Nevertheless, Jeszenszky also hopes for the revival of the CEI, 
because all member states should be interested in increased 
economic exchange, all the more so after peace in Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. This also offers the chance of closer 
political cooperation, Jeszenszky concluded.

  [Text] Hungary and Ukraine will cooperate in the 
Partnership for Peace program. The defense ministers of the two 
countries have agreed on this at their meeting in Budapest. 
  Army General Vitaliy Hryhororovich Radetskyy, speaking at a 
press briefing, said that they also discussed regional 
cooperation from which they do not want to exclude Russia. They 
also decided that a committee of experts would be set up to 
examine the possibility of military industrial cooperation. 
Hungary is interested primarily in obtaining parts for 
aircraft, tanks, and armored combat vehicles.

<F P=106> ["L.G."-initialed report: "Chairman's Orders on Program </F>
Making -- The Campaign on the Television"] 
  [Text] On 8 February, in a chairman's order, Gabor Nahlik, 
Hungarian Television's deputy chairman who has the powers of 
chairman, published the guidelines on program-making which, 
based on the election code of ethics, determine public service 
television programming during the election campaign. 
  Accordingly, the News, The Week, and the Daybreak [Napkelte] 
programs will follow the events of the campaign in the first 
period of the election campaign, strictly adhering to the 
principles of proportionality and impartiality. In this period, 
the television will not broadcast paid election advertisements. 
  In the campaign period in the stricter sense of the word, 
the 
television will broadcast campaign programs by introducing the 
parties and their candidates that have a national list. 
  It will provide an opportunity for the parties to contrast 
their views and ideas twice a week in 60-minute discussion 
programs. The leaders on party lists will participate in the 
last, 90-minute discussion forum to be held two days before the 
elections. 
  During the four-week campaign period, all parties that are 
on 
national lists can appear on television with a film edited by 
themselves and at their own costs, in the order drawn in front 
of a public notary. Every party will have two chances to 
appear, first with a five-minute film, then with a 10-minute 
one. To prepare these programs, the parties will be able to use 
Hungarian Television's film archives for a charge, but they can 
only use material made on them and not other parties. In the 
actual campaign period, all parties can have altogether one 
minute per day advertising time on the two channels together. 
The propaganda films will be made at the cost of the parties 
and the television will broadcast these for 10 percent of the 
usual charge. The broadcasting time of these advertising films 
will be decided by a draw. The same applies to the period 
between the two rounds of the elections. 
  In accordance with the election code of ethics, parties that 
set up lists have to be shown in news programs on the election 
events under identical conditions, and the election reports have 
to be done in proportion to their nominations. The duty of the 
election programs is to explain the electoral law in an 
understandable way, and to assert that participation in the 
elections is a moral and political obligation for all citizens. 
To inform the public, constitutional lawyers and politicians 
will explain the electoral system, its advantages as opposed to 
other systems, and the procedure of the elections. According to 
the chairman's orders, to mobilize the public and to ensure the 
highest possible participation, these programs will have to show 
the election experiences of western countries, the electoral 
activities of Hungarians living in the West, and well-known 
Hungarian intellectuals will have to speak about this issue. 
The views of the committee that is defined in the elections 
code of ethics will have to be asked on disputed or unclear 
issues. These orders will come into force from the date of 
their publication, namely 4 February 1994.

  [Text] Prague (DDP/ADN) -- Defense Minister Volker Ruehe 
sees "certain possibilities" that Slovakia could accede to NATO 
by the end of the century. Ruehe said at the conclusion of a 
two-day visit to Bratislava (Pressburg) that this is, however, 
dependent on international developments. The German delegation 
has gained the impression that Slovakia is preparing for 
membership of western structures in all areas. 
  In Bratislava, Ruehe met President Kovac, Prime Minister 
Meciar, Assembly Speaker Gasparovic, Foreign Minister Moravcik, 
and his counterpart Andrejcak. An agreement on cooperation in 
the military field was signed during the visit. Ruehe said that 
he sees the preconditions for close, positive cooperation 
between Germany and Slovakia.

  [Draskovic] We discussed the reasons for the delay in the 
formation of the parliament, which is a peculiar form of 
obstruction. I informed the president of the fact that this 
obstruction cannot be overcome without a political agreement. 
To the president's words that he favored a government of 
national unity, I replied that, regarding the SPO and DEPOS 
[Democratic Movement of Serbia], we want more than that; 
national unity. However, in this, the SPO, naturally, wishes to 
carry some of the responsibility for the atmosphere in the 
parliamentary life of the country -- Serbia and the federal 
state. Regarding government, we do not wish to take part in any 
government, be it republican or federal, and this was my stance.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ibrahim Rugova, president of the republic of </F>
Kosova, by Sali Kelmendi in Tirana; date not given -- live or 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Kelmendi] Good evening, dear viewers. Ibrahim 
Rugova, president of the republic of Kosova, recently visited 
the United States, where he held talks with top U.S. 
personalities -- President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, the 
secretary of state, his assistants, and U.S. congressmen. Can 
you please inform our viewers about your trip and assess the 
talks you held there? 
  [Rugova] My visit to the United States was very successful. 
As you know, we have had continuous contacts with the United 
States, the U.S. Congress, the Senate, and the State Department. 
We had the honor and special pleasure to meet President Clinton 
and Vice President Al Gore and their wives. President Clinton 
personally expressed special gratitude to our peaceful movement 
and the contribution that we have made to the stability in the 
region, as well as continued support of the United States on the 
Kosova issue and the Albanian question. Vice President Al Gore, 
who was already familiar with the Kosova question, also 
expressed his own support to the Kosova issue and a peaceful 
solution to this question. 
  It was a special honor to attend the international prayer, 
which has been held for more than 30 years in the United States, 
where Mother Teresa was one of the central figures concerning 
the Albanian question. Our presence at the morning prayer was 
marked as an Albanian day in Washington and an affirmation of 
our people. It was these particular moments that made the visit 
a very successful and important one, particularly the meeting 
with the U.S. President. 
  [Kelmendi] During the talks you held with high-level U.S. 
personalities, you informed them about the grave situation in 
Kosova, especially the repression and violence of the Serbian 
occupying power, the economic situation, the humanitarian 
question, and human rights and freedoms. What do the U.S. 
officials think about these problems? 
  [Rugova] The United States, the U.S. Congress, and the State 
Department know the situation in Kosova quite well. As you 
know, they publish annual reports on Kosova, particularly the 
State Department, on human rights. The last report was published 
recently, and we received a copy while we were there. The 
attitude is to support and assist Kosova in the future. Several 
aid supplies administered by the U.S. Congress two years ago and 
last year have arrived in Kosova this year, and they amount to 
several million dollars. This was the concrete assistance that 
has arrived in Kosova. Of course, I can also mention the 
political and diplomatic assistance that will be extended to 
Kosova in the future, as well as the good disposition on the 
Kosova issue that has existed in U.S. state institutions for 
years. 
  [Kelmendi] President Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State 
Christopher have several times asserted that they will not allow 
the war to spread to Kosova, i.e., to the south front. At the 
same time, the congressmen with whom you talked declared that 
they will draft new resolutions on the question of Kosova and 
they will support Kosova. How do you assess these stands, and 
what do you expect in the near future in this direction? 
  [Rugova] The U.S. officials asserted that what President 
Clinton and Mr. Christopher have said are serious statements, so 
we will continue to wait for all these institutions to move 
ahead on the Kosova question. 
  [Kelmendi] Mr. Chairman, let us go back to the end of last 
year. You conducted a long tour of some European countries. 
You were received by foreign ministers of those countries and 
state ministers as well. This was, undoubtedly, a recognition 
of Kosova's subjectivity and your legitimacy as president of the 
republic of Kosova. After the talks with European and U.S. 
personalities, how do you assess the situation in Kosova? What 
do you expect this year? Is this a further acceleration toward 
a peaceful solution of the Kosova question? 
  [Rugova] This is an increasingly great affirmation. As you 
know, the tour I conducted at the end of last year in Europe and 
this one in the United States is an increasingly great 
affirmation of the Kosova issue and an international 
subjectiveness or an international element of Kosova and its 
further legitimacy. As you know and as we have often said, 
these questions make up a process; thus, we should be organized, 
have more contacts, and especially arrange a better organization 
in Kosova. All these would be a contribution for the solution 
of the Kosova question through peaceful and political means. To 
tell the truth, everyone is concerned that no conflict or new 
tragedy occurs in Kosova. That is why preventive measures 
should be taken to avoid the worse, which would be very tragic 
for the region and Kosova itself. 
  [Kelmendi] It is assessed that further sanctions against 
Serbia will be one of the elements that will help to solve the 
crisis in Kosova, and perhaps to stop the war in Bosnia. Did 
you talk about the continuation of the sanctions against Serbia 
and Montenegro, and are they in a way connected to the situation 
in Kosova? 
  [Rugova] Concretely, in the United States we asserted that 
these sanctions will not be abolished, but may be further 
intensified. They are a means to exert pressure on Serbia, with 
regard not only to other issues such as Bosnia and Croatia in 
former Yugoslavia, but also to Kosova, because Kosova as well is 
included in these conditions for the abolishment of sanctions. 
For the moment we cannot talk about the abolishment of 
sanctions, which certainly will be intensified. 
  [Kelmendi] Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg have summoned 
a conference in Geneva today with the participation of the 
neighboring countries of former Yugoslavia; they have called it 
a consultative conference. What do you think, will this 
conference discuss the question of Kosova? Will this be a 
further step forward toward the solution of the Kosova problem, 
especially when President Berisha declared that without solving 
the Kosova issue there cannot be a solution of the Balkan 
problems? 
  [Rugova] I agree with President Berisha's statement and I 
consider this conference or this consultative meeting as a 
consultation about the issues in former Yugoslavia which, of 
course, the neighboring countries are interested in as well. As 
you know, the neighboring countries were present at the London 
conference. However, this was more an international meeting 
where they had no possibility to tell their viewpoints so 
openly, as far as I can remember. For us it is important 
because Albania is there and of course, Albania will put forward 
the question of Kosova and that of the Albanians living in their 
ethnic territories. That is, this is important. It is a bit 
early to say that this will be a step forward or a more positive 
step. However, as a consultation it should be greeted. Of 
course, even a solution to this problem will not be successful 
without the neighboring countries and a global approach to all 
the problems in former Yugoslavia, because this was one of the 
central states of the Balkans. 
  [Kelmendi] We hope that the affirmation of Kosova in the 
international relations will soon bring Kosova to the table for 
talks at the required level as you have always demanded, as one 
of the ex-units of former Yugoslavia, where a solution will be 
found in conformity with the people's will expressed in a 
referendum. 
  [Rugova] We hope and we are working in this direction. As 
for a peaceful and political solution, of course we have thought 
about it. We have requested international protection, a system 
of civil protectorate that is more advanced, so as to normalize 
life and institutions and then we can talk about the question of 
Kosova. As we have mentioned several times, this is an idea and 
question that is transmitted with interest by all institutions, 
be they European, U.S., or international ones. 
  [Kelmendi] Mr. President, your meeting with President 
Clinton is the first meeting of a Kosova president or a Kosova 
representative with the U.S. President. This occasion reminds 
us of the commitment of the former U.S. President Woodrow 
Wilson. Can you tell us something for our viewers, how did this 
meeting pass and in what atmosphere? 
  [Rugova] It was the first time that Kosova was accepted at 
this level and the contact and talks were recognized. I can 
personally say that it was a warm meeting with a great human 
empathy on the part of President Clinton, which I had the 
occasion to see directly. He had a great understanding on the 
question of Kosova. Concerning the relation to President Wilson, 
both are Democrats. However, this is not of great importance, 
but I can say that the President of that time, President Wilson, 
was a great man who managed to put the question of Albania 
outside the question of the Adriatic, which meant the partition 
of the Albanian question. I can say that his well-known 14 
Points, a program for the security of democracy in the world, 
were followed by President Bush with the collapse of communism 
in the East. And today we find the same vocabulary in President 
Clinton's policy, so as to promote a world security or in this 
case, a European security, for the development of democracy, 
which is very important. As a matter of fact, President Clinton 
is a man of peace, understanding, and democracy. I had the 
occasion to see this in my personal meeting with him which was, 
I can say once again, a special honor to me and the people of 
Kosova and the Albanians. I thank you very much, greeting the 
viewers of this television satellite program as well. 
  [Kelmendi] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Ion Cristoiu editorial: "Hatred Against Romania Has Been </F>
Unleashed in Chisinau"] 
  [Text] The end of last week was dominated by the 
spectacular statements made by President Mircea Snegur and 
Dumitru Motpan, president of the ruling party in the Republic of 
Moldova, on the issue of relations with Romania. As far as we 
could learn from the reports of press agencies, at the congress 
of the Civic Alliance in the Republic of Moldova, an 
organization set up in order to give unconditional support for 
President Mircea Snegur, the latter declared that the 
unification with Romania must be eliminated from the 
preoccupations of the political life in the Republic of Moldova 
and any stand toward Bucharest must proceed from the 
delimitation of the term Moldovan from the term Romanian. In 
Mircea Snegur's view, the Romanians in Bessarabia are not 
Romanians, but Moldovans, and it is not the Romanian language 
that is spoken between the Prut and Dniester Rivers, but the 
Moldovan language! Thus, as Dumitru Motpan, the leader of the 
Agrarian Democratic Party of the Republic of Moldova, said in a 
speech made on the same day at an electoral meeting in the 
locality of Cantemir, if the issue of unification is ever 
raised, this will mean not Romania, but only a part of it, 
namely Moldavia, and the Republic of Moldova and Moldavia will 
make up, in the view of those in Chisinau, one single nation, 
namely the Moldovan nation. The affirmations of Mircea Snegur 
and of the leaders of the ruling party in the Republic of 
Moldova were not just some statements made during a drinking 
bout. They were made in an official framework and, what is more 
serious, with the intention of making them, from now on, become 
a fundamental idea of the domestic and foreign policy of the 
Republic of Moldova. 
  As such, the affirmations of the two leaders are not at all 
surprising. The categorical rejection of the unification has, 
for quite a while, been one of the dominant ideas of the policy 
promoted by Mircea Snegur. The fact that people in Bucharest 
viewed this issue differently is very simple to explain. Mircea 
Snegur's true position has been hidden under a veil of ambiguous 
smiles, smiles meant to put the Chisinau leadership in the role 
of a lamb that is feeding from two sheep. Smiling at both 
Russia and Romania, Mircea Snegur was able to obtain significant 
economic aid from both countries. The illusion created by 
Mircea Snegur's duplicity was supported for a long time by the 
special relations of the Republic of Moldova with President Ion 
Iliescu. Did anybody realize that the Chisinau leader is a 
ferocious anti-unionist, more than certain that the "brotherly" 
Snegur-Iliescu meetings would have led to the deterioration of 
Ion Iliescu's electoral capital. The affirmations made by 
Mircea Snegur and Dumitru Motpan are not surprising, not in the 
least, if we look at the current situation in the Republic of 
Moldova. Elections are approaching beyond the Prut River. And 
considering that the unification with Romania does not seem to 
be favored by the great majority of the population, including 
Romanians, Mircea Snegur and his people, in order to win the 
elections, saw themselves compelled to make the issue of 
rejecting unification a whipping boy of the electoral campaign. 
If, taken as they are, the declarations of the two leaders are 
not surprising, nevertheless, the feelings that can be guessed 
behind them are shocking. To the astonishment of the Romanians, 
the declarations made at the end of last week betray a genuine 
hatred for the Romanians in Romania. Willingly or unwillingly, 
the two leaders want to picture us as a mortal danger for the 
interests of the citizens of the Republic of Moldova. One can 
see clearly that Mircea Snegur and Dumitru Motpan intend to lead 
an electoral campaign based not only on the rejection of 
unification, but also on stirring up hatred against us, that is, 
the Romanians on this side of the Prut River. No matter what is 
reason for this goal, the attempt to implement it is as 
dangerous as possible for Romania. Since the dismantlement of 
the former Soviet Union, the economic, social-political, and 
cultural relations between Romania and the Republic of Moldova 
have increased. Within the framework of this process, the 
Romanians in Romania have become a real presence beyond the Prut 
River both through the numerous trips they made there, and 
through the numerous private firms and cultural organizations 
that they have established there. The declarations of the two 
leaders might be the beginning of violence of great proportions 
against all Romanian citizens present, for one reason or 
another, in the Republic of Moldova. In the case of 
correspondents Anda Florea and Mircea Dascaliuc, this is most 
significant. From this point of view, it would not be an 
exaggerated act if Romanian citizens would be advised to avoid, 
at least for the period of the electoral campaign, trips to 
localities beyond the Prut River. This would be beneficial not 
only for them, but also for the cause of unification.

  [Text] Mr. Oliviu Gherman, president of the ruling Social 
Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR], said at his party's news 
conference today that the provisions of the IMF memorandum, 
which are a substantial part of the economic policy of our 
country, must be discussed in the parliament because the ruling 
party is interested in having this accord represent the 
political option of all parties and should not be solved through 
a simple signature on the document. 
  Regarding another issue, Mr. Gherman assessed that the open 
letter addressed to the parties that belong to the Democratic 
Convention and the Democratic Party represents the decision of 
the permanent delegation and means that the ruling party is open 
for political dialogue. In the view of the PDSR, three stages 
are necessary to finalize the dialogue: to establish the 
principles for a cooperation in the political arena; to work out 
a program regarding the unfolding of the reform in Romania; and 
to hold discussions on the basis of a government coalition. 
  Referring to the recent declarations made by the president 
of 
the Republic of Moldova and Agrarian Party leader, Ioan Solcanu, 
vice president of the PDSR, expressed his concern that such 
pro-Russian ideologies tend to become state policy. The message 
of the PDSR is the following: We should not forget that all of 
us are Romanians and history cannot be distorted according to 
momentary interests.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Ion Cristoiu: "Who Is Interested in Making Us </F>
Appear in the World as a Nation of Cunning People"] 
  [Text] The government coalition has made and continues to 
make a big fuss about our image in the world. Through this 
image, one certainly understands not only opinions about Romania 
of today but also about the Romanians as a nation. Therefore, 
the left-wing coalition, sprinkled with nationalism, has 
protested against Romania being presented abroad either as a 
bloodthirsty nation or a nation of profiteers. From this point 
of view, the criticism of certain exaggerated adventures of some 
of our fellow citizens abroad was more than justified. On the 
basis of the fact that in who knows what capital city of the 
world, a Romanian has been caught stealing something, the 
conclusion often drawn is that the Romanians are a nation of 
petty thieves. Less justified were the explanations given by 
the government coalition for the bad image of Romanians in the 
world. The domestic and foreign press were accused of 
practicing falsifications and exaggeration. The pro-government 
and pro- presidential correspondents have carried out quite a 
few attacks against the so-called defamation of the Romanian 
realities by the domestic press, which is sold to the enemies of 
the country. 
  It is not excluded that the international press has also 
played a certain role in establishing our image as a nation. In 
the search for a sensation, it sometimes chooses something that 
is shocking in the life of a nation or a country. However, the 
major responsibility for the negative image, with which the name 
of Romania is associated in the world, should be sought 
elsewhere, namely some of the current actions of the ruling 
coalition -- that is, precisely the force that is complaining 
everywhere about the distortion of our image abroad. A ominous 
example in this respect is the stand of the Romanian officials 
regarding the fulfillment of conditions that were set to us when 
we were admitted to the Council of Europe. When the famous 
amendments to the admittance documents were formulated, we stood 
at attention and shouted more than the gentle soldier Svejk: 
Yes, sir! We pledge to fulfill them and overfulfill them! 
Since they are serious people who know what a pledge means, the 
Council of Europe admitted us. However, they pointed it out, in 
a polite but firm manner, that the amendments must be 
implemented in Romania's social and political life. At that 
time, they could not imagine that anything else might happen 
except that after our admittance to the Council of Europe, we 
would immediately and enthusiastically start implementing the 
solemnly made commitments. At that time, I was among the 
analysts who issued a warning -- namely, that we should not play 
with fire. Some of the amendments -- we said then -- were 
absurd. They expressed the aberrant tendency of West Europe to 
impose rigidly its own living standards on the specific 
realities prevailing in East Europe. Thus, I was saying that it 
would have been much better if we had stated that we would not 
be able to fulfill all the conditions. Maybe we would not have 
been admitted to the Council of Europe, but we would have been 
much more honest, more correct, and, mainly, much closer to the 
national interest. All this, because it would be much more 
serious if the West had created an image about us as a nation 
that does not know how to keep its word than not admit us into 
the Council of Europe. Since we have been accepted, considering 
that we gave our solemn word, we should by all means start 
fulfilling the conditions set by the Council of Europe. My 
warning was based on a suspicion -- that the Romanian officials 
do not intend to do anything toward the implementation of those 
amendments. When we were admitted to the Council of Europe, we 
acted in accordance with our old Dimbovita [river crossing 
Bucharest] style -- that is, "We say as they say, but we do as 
we want." Unfortunately, my suspicion has been justified. 
After we had been accepted to the Council of Europe -- that is, 
after we crossed the bridge -- we did nothing to fulfill our 
promise. In Strasbourg recently, our parliamentary delegation 
was placed in an uncomfortable situation. When asked about the 
stage of implementation of the respective amendments, the 
delegation had to hum and how, stammer in embarrassment, and 
even lie. Considering that the people at the Council of Europe 
are very polite, they did not tell us what they thought about 
our attitude. However, I am sure that, among themselves, they 
thought immediately about the accusations voiced against us -- 
that we are a nation of cunning and boasting people who promise 
a lot and do nothing. Then, is it not natural to ask who is 
contributing to the negative image that is circulating in the 
world about the Romanian people?

national defense minister, said that he, together with other top 
officials of the ministry, had examined in Cluj the 1993 balance 
of the 4th Army [the Transylvanian army], as well as aspects 
related to military discipline and order in that army. They 
found that the activity of the 4th Army was very well organized. 
  Minister Spiroiu rejected allegations published in today's 
edition of the daily ULTIMUL CUVANT [THE LAST WORD] that he went 
to Cluj to remove the current commander of the 4th Army, General 
Paul Cheler. Spiroiu added that he regrets that such news is 
being circulated without first checking with the Army Press 
Office.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "General Spiroiu Wants To End </F>
Conflict With C.V. Tudor"] 
  [Text] Romania's minister of national defense, General 
Niculae Spiroiu, declared in a television broadcast of the "Pro 
Patria" program that he wishes to end the conflict with Senator 
C.V. Tudor. "Let us consider it a closed chapter, we have much 
to do in the Army," said Mr. Spiroiu, although at the news 
conference of the Greater Romania Party on 3 February the leader 
of that party continued his accusations and slander against the 
dignitary, who is a member of the Vacaroiu government. He 
called the defense minister: "A minister who is a trafficker and 
a maniac," "a political adventurer," "the epitome of 
incompetence," and a person who "demolished the arms industry," 
"turned the ministry into a small feudal family," and 
"permanently misinformed the state institutions." Here are a 
few examples of the way Senator V.C. Tudor portrayed Minister 
Spiroiu at the recent news conference of the Greater Romania 
Party. Therefore, the general's decision to call for an end to 
the conflict is viewed as a more than surprising act, since Mr. 
Spiroiu has not even turned to the legal authorities to have 
Senator C.V. Tudor reprimanded for his remarks.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bela Marko, chairman of the Democratic Union </F>
of Hungarians in Romania, and Executive Chairman Csaba Takacs by 
Janos Gyarmath; place and date not given: "There Has Been No 
Breakthrough"] 
  [Text] At the initiative of Romanian President Ion 
Iliescu, the dialogue with the Democratic Union of Hungarians in 
Romania [RMDSZ] reopened on 1 February, after an interval of 
almost a year. The long "diplomatic" recess in itself shows the 
tension between the presidential body and the RMDSZ, mainly as a 
result of the fact that the RMDSZ remained uncompromising even 
after its Brasov congress, did not discard its goals, and 
consistently adhered to its program; President Ion Iliescu has 
repeatedly expressed his resentment because of this. In his 
view, the national minority issue in Romania has been 
satisfactorily settled in every respect according to the 
international norms, the causes of possible differences of views 
should be sought only among the minorities themselves, primarily 
the RMDSZ, who are fighting for privileges rather than for 
rights. Although Iliescu has hardly changed anything in his 
concept, he nevertheless invited the leadership of the RMDSZ for 
a dialogue on 1 February, probably in view of the events and 
unfavorable international reactions, as well as out of certain 
political considerations. 
  [Gyarmath] We have already cleared up the misunderstanding 
that it was President Iliescu, and not the RMDSZ, who initiated 
this meeting. As far as I know, the RMDSZ had prepared for the 
meeting and was ready for dialogue. Mr Marko, how did you 
actually prepare for this meeting, and what was its goal? 
  [Marko] It is well known that the RMDSZ had not been in the 
presidential palace for almost a year, but this does not mean 
that every contact was severed. Thus, before the start of the 
end-of- the-year consultations initiated by Ion Iliescu, it was 
not yet clear whether the parties of the Democratic Convention 
would appear together or separately, so we prepared for both 
possibilities. As is well known, a joint delegation met with 
Ion Iliescu after all, and our representatives, including 
myself, were also part of this delegation. However, under these 
circumstances, we could only summarily mention our particular 
demands and ideas. At the end of the talks, the president came 
up with a proposal to meet him separately, and we could not 
reject this offer because our organization favors an open 
dialogue and also because we had things to say to him. Our goal 
was finally to hand over the package of documents prepared by 
our Executive Committee. 
  [Gyarmath] What is in this package? 
  [Marko] Let us begin -- precisely because of its timeliness 
owing to the approaching Council of Europe deadline on Romania's 
implementation of its proposals -- with our memorandum to the 
Council of Europe and its appendix, which we sent to Strasbourg 
recently. The package also contains the bill on national 
minorities and autonomous communities formulated by the RMDSZ 
and registered by Parliament, a bill that we included for 
purposes of information and study, as well as numerous analyses, 
memoranda, and documentation regarding education, 
self-government bodies, the restitution of church properties, 
the fate of the convicts from Hargita county and Marosvasarhely 
[Tirgu Mures], and the increasingly tense inter- ethnic 
relations in the Kovaszna and Cluj counties. When describing 
the package of documents at the beginning of the meeting, I 
stressed that it contained all the essential problems facing the 
Hungarians living in Romania, and it listed not only the 
unsolved problems but also the solutions. 
  [Gyarmath] Therefore, we can practically call it a package 
of RMDSZ proposals.... 
  [Marko] Obviously, because we presented solutions to the 
national minority issue and how the problems of the Hungarian 
community in Romania should be treated. We also indicated that 
this meeting was taking place at a time when four months had 
already passed since Romania's acceptance onto the Council of 
Europe, and two months before officials would visit Romania to 
see which Council of Europe proposals this country had 
implemented. We concluded that, in our opinion, none of these 
proposals had been implemented! Thus, the RMDSZ has not seen any 
progress either in the past four years or the past four months! 
Obviously, a lot of questions could already have been resolved, 
such as the issue of the convicts of Zetelak, Oroszhegy, and 
Marosvasarhely, which the president himself and other 
responsible government officials had promised would be solved by 
the end of last year. 
  [Gyarmath] How did the president receive all this? 
  [Marko] After a short presentation of the package of 
documents, we had a long talk and discussion for more than three 
hours, in the course of which we reviewed the essential issues 
included in these documents. I must immediately point out that, 
as I see it, the president has not changed his position 
expressed during previous meetings. Therefore, we told him 
that, as long as he thinks that there are no problems in 
legislation and in shaping legal frameworks in Romania, while we 
claim that we need totally new legal frameworks here, we cannot 
imagine how to seek a solution. Therefore, all that happened was 
that I myself and my colleagues listed and presented our 
positions on these issues with arguments and documents. The 
mere presentation of the problems showed that the situation was 
stagnating and opposite trends were emerging. 
  [Gyarmath] What conclusion did you draw in the end? 
  [Marko] As I see it, the president continues to hold a 
totally different position from ours; thus, the two positions 
have not come closer to each other and there has been no 
breakthrough. We can, however, call it a positive development 
that the president declared that they would study the documents 
presented by us and we would be informed about their conclusions 
in writing. At the same time, the president proposed to make 
this form of a dialogue a regular feature: a meeting every 
quarter of a year. In connection with this, we told him that 
this only made sense if these dialogues took place in the spirit 
of solutions, that is, if there is progress after these 
meetings. We refuse to engage in fruitless and empty dialogues. 
Of course, many things happen and many things are said at a 
meeting of more than three hours. 
  [Takacs] These negotiations have again proved the opposing 
viewpoints from which we approach the issues and democracy in 
Romania. It is well known that the RMDSZ is in favor of a 
general democratic restructuring, and the national minority 
issue is one of the components of this restructuring. At the 
same time, our opinions also differ on whether Romania's 
interests coincide with the interests of the current government. 
The positions regarding Romania, the Romanian people, and the 
processes that accelerate or hinder this democratic 
restructuring became clear during the meeting. Thus, although 
Ion Iliescu made a lot of critical remarks about the RMDSZ 
address during this meeting, we refuted all of them one after 
the other. For example, he criticized us for sending a 
memorandum to the international forum and for formulating a 
reminder after four months. It clearly transpired from his 
approach to this and other issues that we have different ideas 
about democracy and progress. After all, strengthening local 
government bodies, decentralization, and the depolitization of 
state institutions are not only in the interest of the Hungarian 
minority but also in the interest of the Romanian people. 
  [Gyarmath] Thus, do you feel that a dialogue of the deaf 
took place in the Cotroceni Palace? 
  [Takacs] Not exactly, because, in my view, during the talks, 
the president slowly began to realize not only that the RMDSZ 
was presenting the issues from its own viewpoint, but that these 
issues can be either acceptable or disputable from the viewpoint 
of a political evaluation and approach. We stressed that in 
these documents, which also include proposals for solutions, we 
are starting from the facts, and not from presenting our 
demands, and it is impossible to refute the elements of reality. 
Nor is it refutable that general democracy and the introduction 
of European norms is also in the interest of Romania, and not 
only that of the opposition or of the RMDSZ. Therefore, we 
think that everything that is good for European democracy and 
everything that raises the standards of these societies in every 
respect is also good for Romania. Strangely enough, if we or 
the opposition say that, they regard it as a hostile 
manifestation. Therefore, we asked the president to try to 
build an objective information channel that shows reality, 
rather than serving power interests. For example, Iliescu had 
just learned that the judges in the trial of the Zetelak affair 
were Romanians, not Hungarians. It also transpired that the 
president had no idea of the discriminatory measures used in 
appointing people in Kovaszna county and of the ethnic pressures 
on so-called non-Hungarian families and children. Although it 
is clear that all this involves a violation of the Constitution, 
the president said that he had no idea of these things. Even if 
this is true, it does not mean that he is free from 
responsibility, because he himself chose his advisers and all 
those who inform him. Therefore, we can say that his team as a 
whole works uniformly against the Hungarians. We stressed that 
we were open to dialogue, and the fact that we handed over our 
document package for studying is a sign of this and, of course, 
we expect a response both in words and deeds. Thus, from our 
viewpoint, I regard this meeting as important because it 
provided an opportunity to inform the president about the issues 
and the political goals of the RMDSZ clearly, unequivocally, and 
without distortions, goals that we will not give up for any 
opportunistic considerations. As for making the dialogue 
between the presidency and the RMDSZ a regular one, we must 
stress that there is only sense in holding such meeting 
regularly if it has no hidden or show-policy aims, if the RMDSZ 
achieves results, and if the meeting is not used to show 
"results" to the international public opinion. In other words, 
the RMDSZ cannot and will not be a partner with any government 
that makes use of a policy of delay. We did not commit 
ourselves to negotiate for decades; we committed ourselves to 
only negotiate if there is a hope of achieving results. 
  [Gyarmath] How would you evaluate the meeting? 
  [Takacs] Obviously, we have a lot of reservations, and we 
can hardly say that we have found understanding. However, we 
cannot say that the meeting was useless. By presenting this 
document package in the spirit of our congress held in Brasso 
[Brasov], all we did was to put the ball into our opponent's 
court. No one will be able to say now that he does not know or 
understand what we want; we have carried out the necessary 
clarification. 
  [Gyarmath] Have you felt any political will toward resolving 
the issues, or even one single issue? 
  [Marko] Neither the opposition nor the RMDSZ should have any 
illusions or believe that any political change will take place 
soon. However, given that this issue requires a more lengthy 
explanation, I think we should let life give an answer and wait 
and see what happens.

<F P=106> [Bogdan Burileanu article: "Zhirinovskiy Dismantles </F>
Romania"] 
  [Text] Zhirinovskiy's latest pronouncements leave no doubt 
at all about the designs of Russian imperialism on Romania. 
Doing us the "honor" of devoting a very suspect kind of 
attention to our country, the favorite horse of the Russian 
electorate has taken up once more his original thesis about the 
artificial nature of the Romanian state, which, according to his 
precarious historical knowledge, is inhabited by Italian 
Gypsies. Now he has also found a final solution to get rid of 
the Romanians: His long-term program envisages nothing more or 
less than wiping out Romania from the map! The western part of 
our country will be given to Hungary and the southern part to a 
future Greater Bulgaria. Let us not delude ourselves into 
thinking that Czar Boris' [Boris Yeltsin, president of the 
Russian Federation] "clown" is dreaming in vain or that he 
failed to pass his geography exams, as seems to be the case with 
the history exam. The fact that his statement makes no mention 
whatsoever of the northern and eastern parts of the country does 
not mean that he lost sight of them. Those territories (Moldova 
and South Bukovina, respectively) have whetted the appetite of 
Russian expansionism for ages. Let us not forget that, in the 
disastrous summer of 1940, the Romanian Army would have still 
been able to defend Transylvania against the implementation of 
the Vienna Diktat [which allocated Northern Transylvania to 
Hungary]. But the Soviets mobilized their troops on the Prut 
River, ready to move up to the Carpathian Mountains, while the 
Bulgarian troops were actively dreaming of taking over all 
Dobrogea. In these conditions, the Crown Council decided to 
accede to the German-Italian verdict, which at least guaranteed 
the country's southern and eastern borders. 
  Unfortunately, Romania finds itself today in a similar 
situation of isolation as 54 years ago. Moreover, today's 
situation is even worse than at that time, if one thinks of the 
fact that there is no longer the oil stake or other lucrative 
concessions which can interest the West in any way. Regardless 
of what one hears, the Partnership for Peace [PFP] remains for 
the time being a mere euphemistic formula of passivity toward 
the same aggressive Russian claims as ever, while the United 
Nations and the CSCE amount to nothing more than what the League 
of Nations had been in the period between the two world wars. 
  On top of all this comes the Yugoslav inferno, where both 
the 
Islamic states and the spokesmen of the pan-Slavic trend are all 
so very eager to become involved. For both of these camps to 
reach there, there is but a single land route, namely through 
Romania. Washed with all waters, the Muslims are refraining from 
making statements, since the element of surprise and the prompt 
use of any favorable set of circumstances have always been the 
asset of the weak. On the other hand, Zhirinovskiy bangs the 
big drum with a brutality that defies all customs, thus making 
it all more threatening. It is not at all accidental that he is 
throwing such an appetizing territorial bait to his fellow 
travelers in both Hungary and Bulgaria, who are on the rise 
there. Encouraged by these strong statements coming from the 
East, it is quite likely that these forces will not take too 
long to begin manifesting themselves. As for the Arabs, they 
are very familiar with many strategic secrets of our country, 
since they did not cater to Ceausescu for nothing. The recent 
contacts established by certain extremist parties with various 
political forces in the respective countries -- Ilie Verdet's 
Socialist Party of Labor [PSM] with Iraq and Greater Romania 
Party's [PRM] Corneliu Vadim Tudor doing the same thing on 
neutral ground, in Cardiff [PRM Leader Corneliu Vadim Tudor 
accompanied Romania's soccer team for an international match 
there in 1993], where he sent obscure messages from the toilets 
of the Welsh stadium, as we were told by some high officials of 
our secret service -- come to complete the aberrant picture of 
an ever closer encirclement and imminent danger. The fact that 
the most vehement "nationalists" are the spokesmen of such 
interests should not come as a surprise to anyone. The wolf in 
sheep's clothing and the quisling have existed since times 
immemorial. Nevertheless, these dissolute elements have never 
expressed themselves more loudly, perfidiously, and 
destructively in the entire history of the Romanian people. 
  There is now a real need for defining and observing the 
national interest. Confronted with such dangers, those at the 
helm of the country must be aware of the huge responsibility 
devolving upon them for the political decisions they are taking. 
After all, it is obvious that our national existence cannot be 
defended now with tricky statements, greasy diplomacy, or 
obscure maneuvers. Romania's place should be unreservedly and 
unequivocally alongside of the Western nations, the only ones 
able to credibly guarantee our existence before the ordeals 
ahead of us. However, in order to be accepted and protected, 
the Romanians must prove, through facts, not only words, that 
they deserve the attention they really need. By mimicking 
democracy, we will not manage to fool anyone. On the other 
hand, we will just be left to drift alone, when fate does not 
seem to favor us so much. 
  President Iliescu refuses, in more or less veiled terms, to 
agree to the necessary change of orientation in the country's 
policy. He prefers to blackmail the West with our geostrategic 
position, pretending that he does not notice its main 
characteristic, namely that we are just one step away from a 
catastrophe, both territorial and temporal. Is his hatred or 
fear of the moral values of the civilized world so high? 
Anyhow, his fear manifests itself the same way as the feelings 
and attitudes of Slobodan Milosevic, Saddam Husayn, Mu'ammar 
al-Qadhdhafi, and more recently Vladimir Wolfovich Zhirinovskiy 
do. The latter -- self- proclaimed uncontested leader of an 
inevitable anti-Western offensive -- has already sealed our 
destiny, a destiny which our national-socialist forces are ready 
to accept, because the civilized world will never accept a Funar 
[Gheorghe Funar, president of the Romanian National Unity 
Party], a Vadim [Corneliu Vadim Tudor, president of the Greater 
Romania Party], and the like of them. Consequently, their state 
of exaltation makes them commit suicide through isolation or 
self-destructive alliances. The tragedy is that, the same as 
the pharaohs, they want Romania also to disappear along with 
them.

  [Excerpts] The United States today officially recognized 
the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYRM] and said it 
will establish full diplomatic relations with it. A statement 
issued by the White House notes that the decision was made in 
recognition of the democratic expression by FYROM of the duty to 
establish a sovereign and independent state based on democratic 
principles. The full recognition was announced today but full 
diplomatic relations will be established when Skopje gives 
assurances that it will cooperate constructively for the 
settlement of its dispute with Greece, a U.S. ally for many 
years, as the statement points out. [passage omitted] 
  Skopje President Kiro Gligorov, who constantly refers to his 
country as the Republic of Macedonia, said that its independence 
and stability are a prerequisite for peace and stability in the 
Balkans. He also noted that good-neighborliness is a vital 
interest of his country and that Skopje is prepared to begin 
immediately to negotiate with Greece within the UN framework in 
goodwill and a desire for mutual understanding and respect for 
mutual interests. He also said that his country respects the 
territorial integrity and borders of Greece and of all the 
neighboring countries. 
  In Athens, Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou tonight 
received 
U.S. Ambassador to Greece Thomas Niles, who conveyed to him an 
official invitation from President Bill Clinton to visit the 
United States in April. 
  On the U.S. recognition of Skopje, government spokesman 
Evangelos Venizelos made the following statement: The Greek 
Government expresses its discontent at the U.S. decision to 
recognize Skopje. This development is certainly not pleasant for 
Greece. It is a wrong move by the United States. However, it 
is a significant fact that the United States is specifically 
reserved about diplomatic relations with Skopje and links it 
with conditions that refer to Skopje's hostile propaganda 
against Greece and to a respect for human rights. [passage 
omitted] 
  There has also been strong reaction by the opposition. New 
Democracy chairman Miltiadhis Evert described the U.S. decision 
as a bad option and added that the Greek Government was taken by 
surprise and was confused.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias returned from 
Geneva late this evening. Our political correspondent Mirela 
Kalostipi has the following telephone dispatch with details: 
  [Begin Kolostipi recording] Good evening, ladies and 
gentlemen. The foreign minister returned from Geneva a short 
while ago. Naturally, correspondents were waiting for him at 
the airport and he made a statement. 
  Concerning the question of U.S. diplomatic recognition of 
Skopje, the foreign minister was asked whether the Skopjeans now 
have a reason to withdraw from their intransigent positions. 
Mr. Papoulias said that the form of recognition has room for 
the U.S. diplomacy. Today the foreign minister said the same 
thing he said when he returned from his visit to the United 
States. He made the appraisal that the normalization of 
Athens-Skopje relations is of more interest to Washington than 
any recognition. In any case, the foreign minister admitted 
that this development was not pleasant for Athens but added that 
on the chess board of international relations and balances the 
Greek Government aims at exploiting whatever is best. 
  Mr. Papoulias was asked about the statement by Andonios 
Samaras [opposition Political Spring party chairman] today that 
the U.S. diplomatic recognition of Skopje would have a negative 
effect on Greek-U.S. relations. Mr. Papoulias said he would not 
like to comment on this statement by Andonios Samaras. However, 
he said, in a critical period Andonios Samaras, who is a former 
foreign minister, should be more careful in his statements 
because, as Mr. Papoulias noted, he knows how difficult the 
issues are and how sensitive this period is. 
  The foreign minister was then asked about the Bosnian issue 
and the imminent decision regarding bombing Serbian targets 
around Sarajevo. Mr. Papoulias said that Greece's reservations 
are a clear answer to the "No" that we have already given on 
military interventions because, as he stressed, we have not been 
convinced by the arguments of those who support the bombings as 
to what will happen the next day. I do not bring any messages 
of optimism, Mr. Papoulias said, because many times we have had 
experiences of agreements that were upset the next day. 
Nevertheless, he stressed, the latest news is such that they 
might turn a NATO decision for bombings out of context. 
  This is all from the airport where Karolos Papoulias 
returned 
from Geneva late this evening. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov by Stojan </F>
Obradovic (Stina); place and date not given: "National 
Exclusivity Leads to Ghettoization"] 
  [Text] Although Macedonia has not yet solved many problems 
regarding its international status -- though it also has many 
domestic tensions -- and the shadow of the possible war is still 
hanging over this area, it seems that Macedonian President Kiro 
Gligorov should not lose any sleep over whether he will win the 
next elections. Public opinion polls show that he is supported 
by approximately 90 percent of the electoral body. What is even 
more interesting is that, regardless of the fact that the 
Macedonian political scene is extremely turbulent and divided, 
Gligorov not only gets support from "his own," but is also 
strongly supported by the Albanian population and the voters of 
the nationalist Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization 
Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity [VMRO-DPMNE], 
whose party is usually very critical of many of his moves and 
even accuses him of "national treason" for allegedly flirting 
with the idea of changing the name of the country, the flag, and 
so forth. However, it seems that ordinary people appreciate 
Gligorov's experienced -- perhaps even cunning or wise, if you 
like -- but extremely efficient way of solving problem after 
problem, many of which are labeled "to be or not to be," in the 
stirred-up situation in Macedonia and its neighborhood. Many 
say the fact that he built his authority on the other side of 
the famous Balkan populist leadership, having imposed some other 
qualities, did a world of good for Gligorov. One of those 
qualities -- bearing those who criticize him no hard feelings, 
as he probably considers it part of his job -- came to the 
surface when we were setting up this interview. We met him at 
the celebration of the most influential Macedonian weekly PULS, 
also famous for its ruthless depiction of the dark side of the 
Macedonian political scene, the weekly that often has no mercy 
for Gligorov himself. Asked why he attended the celebration of a 
newspaper that often criticizes and attacks him, he replied 
that, as we all know, the authorities are not immaculate, and 
the job of the media, among other things, is to remind the 
authorities of that. At the beginning of the interview, we 
"reminded" President Gligorov of the burning Macedonian problem 
--relations with Greece. 
<H5>  Talks, Not Skirmish, With Greece </H5>
  [Obradovic] At the recently held session of the Greek 
Parliament, Papandreu has again said they would not recognize 
Macedonia under its name. Naturally and most importantly, 
European powers recognized Macedonia, but solving the problem of 
relations with Greece is important for stability of this region 
and for Greek- Macedonian relations. What do you think will be 
the final solution? 
  [Gligorov] I think the most natural way would be to continue 
the talks we began under the auspices of the United Nations and 
Mr. Vance. We managed to make a few steps forward in those 
negotiations, but then they were interrupted by Greece for 
understandable reasons -- they went to the elections, which are 
now over. Now they have a new government and we must continue 
to negotiate. That is the only possible way. Everything else 
-- skirmishing, stipulating terms for the beginning of the 
negotiations -- should not be happening between two members of 
the United Nations, and would ultimately produce no results. 
Things will get better eventually. 
<H5>  Differentiation Among the Macedonian Albanians </H5>
  [Obradovic] Albanian-Macedonian relations are evidently one 
of the most important internal problems of Macedonia. Those 
relations are burdened by many problems and things got worse 
after it was discovered that the Albanians had weapons. Is it 
possible control over those relations could be lost and that 
this would escalate into a conflict? 
  [Gligorov] I do not expect that. What is happening in 
Albanian parties is something normal in a law-ordered, 
democratic country -- people are gradually being divided 
according to their views on some problems. 
  The worst possible thing is when a nation, any nation, is 
homogenized around certain demands, especially if they become 
extremely nationalistic. That would lead to separation, not to 
mention the ghettoization of certain parts of the population. 
Some Albanians are undergoing a kind of political 
differentiation. Basically, I appreciate that, for it is 
actually a democratic process. It is another matter that third 
parties are becoming involved in the internal discussions in 
some Albanian parties. That is impermissible and bad, for that 
means interfering in our domestic problems. 
  Otherwise, I view this process of differentiation as a will 
of a huge majority of people who want their Macedonia to become 
a state, i.e. of those people who consider it their homeland. 
On the other side, there are extremists who still dream of 
greater Albania. 
  [Obradovic] You mentioned interference of a third side. I 
suppose you meant Albania. Do you intend to start negotiating 
with them and ask them not to do that? 
  [Gligorov] We talk to them and I think it would be normal to 
continue doing that, as well as to establish internationally 
recognized norms of behavior that will strengthen and develop 
our cooperation. We had a good cooperation for a while, and we 
must overcome these events. 
<H5>  Toward "Partnership for Peace" </H5>
  [Obradovic] Macedonia has welcomed President Clinton's 
initiative regarding the restructuring of NATO and the 
"Partnership for Peace" project. Are there any chances for 
Macedonia to become involved in that project? 
  [Gligorov] We have already applied to participate in 
"Partnership for Peace" and, in my opinion, the only hindrance 
is that we are still not a member of the CSCE [Conference for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe] because Greece objects to 
that. If we manage to overcome that, all members of the CSCE 
have, in principle, the right and the possibility to participate 
in that association. I think that Macedonia satisfies all 
conditions for becoming a member of "Partnership for Peace" 
association in every way. 
  [Obradovic] Do you think one will be able to break the 
resistance of Greece soon? What condition have they set? 
  [Gligorov] I cannot predict when, but I think it cannot be 
postponed simply because Greece is practically the only country 
that opposes our becoming a member of the CSCE. Therefore, on 
one hand, we will try to continue negotiating with Greece and, 
on the other, we will try to realize that goal within the CSCE. 
<H5>  Life Wants an Agreement </H5>
  [Obradovic] Macedonia is, naturally, still not involved in 
the war, but it cannot ignore the events on the territory of 
former Yugoslavia. Can you comment on the latest agreement 
between Tudjman and Milosevic? 
  [Gligorov] As a country that, first of all, strives toward 
peace, negotiations, tolerance, solving the global situation in 
the Balkans, and finding points of contact for future 
cooperation, we welcome every step in realizing those goals. It 
is difficult for me to comment on what lies behind this 
agreement and what could be its consequences. 
  Some say it has something to do with the agreement made in 
Karadjordjevo, others that it is an interim agreement made in 
order to force the Muslims to sign the peace agreement under 
conditions arranged between the two sides. However, one must 
also consider huge interests in the normalization of relations 
between the two countries; the main traffic route was 
interrupted, and so were the oil pipeline and telephone 
communications, but one must go on living, one must find some 
points of contact to start taking practical steps in order to 
overcome the atmosphere of war. I think the agreement is a wide 
and complex matter and that it must be considered from different 
aspects. 
  [Obradovic] Some say that Macedonia is yet to face certain 
problems regarding the fact that it must start restructuring its 
economy, and that social tensions will probably increase, and 
that it must realize an economic program that requires some 
sacrifice, etc. Can that further complicate the domestic 
situation in Macedonia? 
  [Gligorov] In the present situation, when there are 
sanctions imposed on Serbia and Montenegro, our road toward 
Europe in the north is getting narrower and narrower. 
Furthermore, considering the open problem with Greece, 
introducing daring reforms, market institutions, and making an 
agreement with the IMF and the World Bank for a stabilization 
program is a very brave and a risky undertaking. But, on the 
other hand, I think delaying it would complicate the situation. 

<H5>    A Tough Nut To Crack </H5>
  [Gligorov] As other examples show, delaying reforms, deeper 
but inevitable changes, cannot buy time. There is just a 
temporary illusion that the situation is under control, but the 
right thing to do is to crack a tough nut, and it will be a very 
tough one indeed. In my opinion, there is no other way. I hope 
that the people of Macedonia -- considering what we went 
through, that we managed to maintain peace and tranquillity -- 
will understand this is a step we must make so that, when the 
war ends, in the process of normalization, we could use this 
advantage, the fact that we were not involved in the war, to 
develop and arrange relations with other Eastern-European 
countries and with our neighbors. That must be an additional 
stimulus for us to succeed in this undertaking. 
<H5>  Favoring the Moderate Option </H5>
  [Obradovic] New elections are supposed to be organized in 
Macedonia this fall. Do you expect some extreme options, 
whether Macedonian or Albanian, to get stronger at those 
elections, which could lead to straining political relations and 
the situation in Macedonia? 
  [Gligorov] This is a regular election year in Macedonia and 
the elections may be a burden to some extent. Passions are 
always intensified in the election year, demands are maximized, 
people do things that trigger emotional reactions, conflicts. 
We must count on all that. However, I think the experience we 
gathered in the past two or three years, as well as global 
events in these parts have taught us we should look for peaceful 
solutions for our future. The people saw that the politics of 
extreme options does not lead anywhere. And the fact that 
extreme nationalism did not win here helped us to stay out of 
the war; otherwise, we would also be in the maelstrom of war. 
Naturally, I think it is not impossible that passion will be 
stirred up again, but in view of what I have just said, I think 
people are now aware of certain things and that they will favor 
the moderate option. 
<H5>  [Box, p 6] </H5>
<H5>  U.S. "Blue Helmets" -- a Warning </H5>
  [Obradovic] The forces of the United Nations are here in 
Macedonia. Is that a certain guarantee that there will be peace 
in Macedonia and what do you think about their role? 
  [Gligorov] That is a relatively small contingent. As a 
military force, it does not bring any significant changes in 
relations in these parts. However, their presence is of 
enormous political and psychological significance. In the 
political sense, it demonstrates the interest of the 
international community in the situation in Macedonia. I think 
the international community has, on time, realized the 
geostrategic importance of Macedonia for the global stability of 
this part of the Balkans in particular, as a pivotal area for 
which, as you know, there have been many battles and wars in 
history. Therefore, the mission of peace-keeping forces has a 
dual role. One is to prevent -- therefore, those forces do not 
act after a conflict happens, they do not separate warring 
factions, but analyze the situation in order to predict possible 
conflicts and thus prevent them. In that sense, Macedonia is a 
very good example. The other role is that the presence of UN 
forces, especially of the contingent of U.S. soldiers, presents 
a kind of warning, a message to all who have a vested interest 
in Macedonia that, in case of conflicts or some events that 
would further complicate the situation with regard to the war 
raging in the north, it will simply not be accepted. 
<H5>  [Box, p 7] </H5>
<H5>  Overcome Extreme Demands </H5>
  [Obradovic] Do you think that the rights of the Albanian 
minority in Macedonia have been protected in the right way or 
should some significant changes occur with regard to that? 
  [Gligorov] Regarding the constitutional position of all 
minorities in Macedonia, I think their rights were rightfully 
established and protected. Many missions of the CSCE and other 
institutions came here to assess constitutional solutions. 
Among others, the well-known Badinter's Commission made up of 
Europe's top lawyers and presidents of constitutional courts, 
has also confirmed that those rights were protected. Much is 
yet to be accomplished in practice on both sides -- on one side, 
to transform that into everyday decisions that will in turn 
enable us to reduce tensions and, on the other, to eliminate 
some extreme demands that have not been fulfilled in any 
European country and that could only lead to increasing 
tensions. I think those demands are, first of all, a reflection 
of what is going on in republics of former Yugoslavia, i.e. in 
the Balkans, with regard to extremist nationalism and extreme 
demands that go far beyond what we are supposed to grant -- 
first of all, to strive toward building a civic state, then 
toward the European option, and then toward alleviating, opening 
up borders and barriers and thus enable free passage of people, 
creating new jobs, letting people decide where and how to live, 
in contrast to present desires of each of those countries to 
realize their own exclusively historic, national and some other 
pretensions, which can lead to escalation of those conflicts.

<F P=106> [Interview with Zbigniew Siemiatkowski, press spokesman for </F>
the Democratic Left Alliance, by Maria Bninska at the Radio ESKA 
studio in Warsaw on the "Guest of ESKA" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Bninska] Good morning to you. 
  [Siemiatkowski] Good morning to you, too. 
  [Bninska] Yesterday's talks ended quite late at night -- in 
any event, we, journalists, did not leave the hotel at Parkowa 
Street until after 2300. Did you, the participants of the 
talks, have any further talks after that? 
  [Siemiatkowski] Yes, we did, but it was a purely social kind 
of meeting. 
  [Bninska] But was anything more decided during that social 
meeting than what we managed to find out? 
  [Siemiatkowski] No, especially given that the meeting 
practically included only members of the Democratic Left 
Alliance [SLD]. It was a meeting whose practical purpose was to 
recap what happened in recent days and also to think what the 
next moves should be, but this time they will be made by SLD. 
  [Bninska] Today's newspapers report that the conflict 
between SLD and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] has been 
overcome. Has it really been overcome, or is it just a 
temporary calm and another story will break soon? 
  [Siemiatkowski] I mean, I would like to make a subtle 
protest here against using the term conflict between SLD and 
PSL. We do not hide the fact that it was indeed a case of a 
crisis in mutual relations between the coalition partners, but 
this crisis was not caused by [word indistinct] issues, I mean 
by personal issues -- that is the way it looked in the 
beginning. It was in essence a grievance of the SLD part of the 
coalition against the part represented by the prime minister, 
over some irregularities in the functioning of the Council of 
Ministers. Everything that was caused by Mr. Kawalec's 
dismissal was a catalyst for some negative phenomena which took 
place in the functioning of the Council of Ministers. 
  [Bninska] Aleksander Kwasniewski used stronger terms when 
talking about that -- he said Prime Minister Pawlak fails to 
observe the coalition agreement. 
  [Siemiatkowski] In this particular case -- and also in some 
others which we also made public -- it was a case of 
nonobservance of some binding provisions on the part of Mr. 
Waldemar Pawlak -- these provisions boiled down to the need to 
consult the deputy prime ministers concerned and in the presence 
of the chairmen of the fractions, over the most important 
strategic and political decisions, including personnel 
decisions. In the case of Mr. Kawalec -- and also in other 
cases, for instance appointing local governors [wojewodowie] -- 
this particular provision of the coalition agreement was not 
observed and that is why it was necessary to have another 
discussion. 
  [Bninska] Yesterday's communique -- which is quite laconic 
-- says that the coalition agreement continues to be binding and 
that both sides will observe it. What kinds of guarantees did 
you [SLD activists] receive that Prime Minister Pawlak will 
observe particularly that provision, when you look ahead a 
month, two, or three months down the road? 
  [Siemiatkowski] The communique is not so laconic at all. It 
contains two very important issues -- it first of all confirms 
that there is a will on both sides to keep the PSL-SLD coalition 
in existence .... 
  [Bninska, interrupting] And what is more, it is to continue 
for as long as four years. 
  [Siemiatkowski] Yes, for four years, so practically 
speaking all the speculations have been cut off at this point -- 
I mean the speculations which emerged in the meantime, 
concerning a possible reversal of alliances. Some have even 
expressed their willingness to participate in such alliances -- 
let me remind you of the funny case of Mr. Krol or Mr. Moczulski 
[of the Confederation for an Independent Poland] among others, 
who have even called a news conference, and felt they were 
almost inside the coalition, but then it turned out nobody 
invited them there in the first place. That is the first issue, 
and the other issue which SLD felt very strongly about, is that 
PSL -- through those who signed the communique, including the 
prime minister himself -- accepts the principle of a unanimous 
support of the budget draft which had been presented by the 
government. That is because we felt at one point -- this was 
our feeling at the time -- that there is a government of Mr. 
Waldemar Pawlak and a budget by Minister Borowski. We took the 
position from the very beginning that it is a budget of Waldemar 
Pawlak's government. The budget was designed according to some 
criteria which allow for a chance for economic growth and for 
maintaining positive economic trends. 
  [Bninska] So my understanding is that there will be no more 
cases such as what happened during a session by a Sejm 
commission where a minister for this government -- I mean the 
foreign economic cooperation minister, Mr. Leslaw Podkanski who 
is at the same time a Sejm deputy -- demanded another trillion 
zlotys for something, and when asked by Mr. Marek Borowski 
whether he made the demand as a minister or as a Sejm deputy, he 
said: This time, I am doing this as a Sejm deputy. 
  [Siemiatkowski] There will be no cases like this. We should 
not have events like the prime minister's speech at the Zeran 
automobile factory where he distanced himself from some price 
rises -- this made it look as if the rises were just Minister 
Borowski's responsibility and as if they had not been agreed 
upon by the entire Council of Ministers -- I mean the price 
rises with regard to energy carriers. We should not have very 
many other examples of such incidents which basically undermined 
the coherency of the cabinet's economic policies. 
  [Bninska] All right, the communique also states that the 
posts of both deputy prime minister and the finance minister, 
will remain within SLD's range of powers. There are rumors that 
perhaps it will not be just one person occupying the two posts, 
like it was in the case of Minister Borowski. The first 
question is: Who will be the finance minister? The second 
question is: Who will be the deputy prime minister? 
  [Siemiatkowski] Of course, I have not been authorized to 
give names at this stage. There are many candidates. The issue 
requires very deep deliberation on SLD's part. The person to 
occupy the post of deputy prime minister and finance minister -- 
I think this is what you mean .... 
  [Bninska, interrupting] So this will be just one person who 
will be in charge of both posts? 
  [Siemiatkowski] Of course, because only the kind of 
positioning of the finance minister which also places him as the 
chairman of the Council of Ministers' Economic Committee, 
creates an opportunity for him to conduct a coherent economic 
policy and to influence measures taken by the individual 
ministers responsible for the economy. I am returning here to 
the conditions set by Minister Borowski before the prime 
minister at one point -- where there was a statement [word 
indistinct] that if the deputy prime minister for economic 
affairs is to be efficient, then his powers should be clearly 
defined and he also must enjoy autonomy in what he does. We 
will return to that condition in our talks with PSL. 
  [Bninska] These conditions were not approved. What will 
happen to them next? 
  [Siemiatkowski] These were not conditions, these were 
postulates for improving the activity of the Council of 
Ministers .... 
  [Bninska, interrupting] But the prime minister refused to 
agree to them. 
  [Siemiatkowski] I think that yesterday's talks -- and also 
subsequent talks ahead of us, this time we will discuss a 
specific person who will take up the post of deputy prime 
minister and finance minister -- will force both us and PSL to 
initiate talks again on the topic of improving the Council of 
Ministers' functioning, on defining the finance minister's 
powers in a clear manner, and also on increasing discipline in 
the course of statements and activities undertaken by the 
individual ministers who on many occasions -- you [addressing 
Bninska] cited an example yourself -- kind of torpedoed the 
finance minister's measures. 
  [Bninska] Will the person who will take up both posts be 
very closely associated with SLD? Or will he be just a 
well-wisher? 
  [Siemiatkowski] Ladies and Gentlemen, Minister Borowski 
established such high standards through his skills and 
competence, that it will be very hard for us to find a person 
who would meet the criteria which are also required for someone 
to fulfill the post of finance minister [word indistinct] 
  [Bninska, interrupting] So there is just one Borowski within 
SLD? 
  [Siemiatkowski] Ladies and Gentlemen, for a few years now we 
have gotten used to Mr. Marek Borowski being the person 
responsible for economic policies within SLD -- and before that, 
in the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic, when we were 
still in the opposition when he was charged with the concept of 
opposition economic policies -- we associated our plans and 
ideas with him, and in a word -- most of us were attached to him 
but as we all know, life does not tolerate a vacuum and there 
are no irreplaceable people. In this situation, we must find 
someone who will be able to continue in a competent manner with 
the policies initiated by Mr. Marek Borowski. That person also 
has to be able to implement the policy in close contact with Mr. 
Marek Borowski, especially since he will also be co-responsible 
as a Sejm deputy and he will have an impact on the government's 
economic policies since he is coming back to the [Sejm] Budget 
Commission where he will work. 
  [Bninska] You came to a compromise with PSL yesterday. If 
my understanding is correct, a compromise is based on giving 
something up in return for gaining something else. What did SLD 
have to give up? 
  [Siemiatkowski] I think we achieved a great deal by forcing 
the prime minister and also our coalition partners from PSL to 
think through the situation that emerged, we forced them to 
discuss again the terms of the coalition agreement, and we also 
forced them to publicly confirm that there is no alternative to 
the PSL-SLD coalition. 
  [Bninska] But you must have given up something. 
  [Siemiatkowski] We gave up Marek Borowski. That is a high 
price to pay. 
  [Bninska] Did you also give up demands for a resignation by 
the chief of the Office of the Council of Ministers [URM] Michal 
Strak? 
  [Siemiatkowski] We have never made this kind of postulate. 
The only postulate we did make was to have a reorganization of 
work done by URM, and we also expressed criticism with regard to 
URM's personnel policies, in particular with regard to the 
government's territorial administration [words indistinct] 
  [Bninska] And what did the prime minister give up during 
yesterday's talks? After all, he also must have given up 
something. 
  [Siemiatkowski] I think he gave up the kinds of statements 
which were made even during the television newscast the day 
before yesterday -- I mean the kinds of statements were he 
distanced himself from Minister Borowski's economic policies 
which were also supported by SLD -- that was an economic policy 
based on the concept of development, but one which also took the 
economic realities into account and which does not create a 
danger of Poland slipping into economic rowdiness, a return of 
inflation, or announcing slogans which are very nice to hear but 
which are economically meaningless. 
  [Bninska] And what did SLD gain? 
  [Siemiatkowski, hesitating] What we gained was a 
confirmation of the will for the SLD-PSL coalition to exist. It 
seems that is .... 
  [Bninska, interrupting] And what did PSL gain? 
  [Siemiatkowski, hesitating] Nobody needed the conflict, and 
we made that clear to our PSL colleagues and partners. It was a 
game with a negative balance -- nobody gained and everybody 
lost. We all lost in the eyes of part of the public opinion 
which at one point had a right to ask the question of whether 
the coalition agreement and the election promises are really 
being implemented in a responsible manner, and also whether the 
significant portion of our society did the right thing by voting 
PSL and SLD on 19 September. We wanted to make that clear to our 
partners, as well -- namely that the real stakes in the game are 
much higher: Public trust, the country's fate, and the fact 
that somebody had put faith in us and we must act accordingly. 
In that context, individual ambitions by parties or people are 
a secondary issue. I think we were probably successful in 
conveying that to our PSL colleagues and to the prime minister 
during yesterday's talks. 
  [Bninska] Has President Lech Walesa finally signed Deputy 
Prime Minister Borowski's resignation? 
  [Siemiatkowski] He affirmed during yesterday's newscast that 
he had signed it. 
  [Bninska] During the same newscast, the president also said 
that the time has come for the parliament to deal with enacting 
legislation and that the time has come for presidential rules. 
What does SLD say to that? 
  [Siemiatkowski] The president's involvement in the last 
stage of the coalition crisis only proves that nobody gained 
anything from the crisis, and if there was anybody who could 
gain, it was the president who immediately used the opportunity 
to have his contribution and to point to the crisis in the 
mutual relations within the coalition and also to imperfect 
constitutional provisions, and in that regard he discussed again 
his concept of a strong presidency. That is just proof that our 
crisis was being watched very closely. We also made it clear to 
our coalition partners that among our mutual obligations toward 
the voters, there is an obligation to speak in favor of a 
constitutional authority based on a cabinet-parliamentary 
system. It would be hard for anyone of us to explain that we 
are in favor of presidential rules. I think the president 
unnecessarily made a hurried gesture in the sense of making 
statements that could in a way strengthen his position. 
  [Bninska] But the president has disliked this government 
from the beginning, and he did not even try to hide it. Most of 
all, he has disliked SLD. Is SLD afraid that the president 
could vigorously try to create presidential rules even before 
his term is over? 
  [Siemiatkowski] The president is a very skillful politician, 
and so he is applying the very old principle of: Divide and 
rule. He points to some parts of the coalition as better than 
others. The most important thing is that we do not let him 
divide us, I mean PSL and SLD. I can see no possibility of any 
special increase in presidential powers before his term is over. 
He is in power based on the Small Constitution and until the 
constitution proper is enacted, all in all his powers are 
limited since he has to share his powers with the executive 
branch -- that is with the government -- and also with the 
legislative branch, that is the parliament. There is a system 
of different forces in effect which mutually control one 
another, and I think the system proves its validity during 
crisis situations which erupt now and then. The president has 
always won when he was an umpire, but in this case he wanted to 
go beyond the role and be a party, in a way. Becoming a party 
to conflicts has always been bad for the presidential post. 
  [Bninska] You said PSL and SLD cannot allow having anyone 
create divisions between them. What about divisions within both 
of them? As recently as the day before yesterday, the prime 
minister quote, played, unquote, this whole conflict, with the 
aim -- among others -- of creating a split within SLD and having 
the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ] sever its 
connections with SLD. 
  [Siemiatkowski] An attempt like this was indeed undertaken. 
We also mentioned that issue to the prime minister during 
yesterday's talks and I think .... 
  [Bninska, interrupting] And what did he say? 
  [Siemiatkowski] An official statement signed by OPZZ Deputy 
Chairman Martyniuk was a lot of food for thought for the prime 
minister -- Martyniuk in a way distanced himself from 
assessments which were contained in the prime minister's 
television appearance. Martyniuk informed that OPZZ is not a 
group which would be interested in creating political 
destabilization in the country and that the trade union -- while 
understanding the supreme interests -- is willing to support the 
budget, and that is also a very important statement which means 
that you just cannot make irresponsible statements like this [by 
Pawlak] and play games with social moods and with moods of 
various interest groups. 
  [Bninska] What are the guarantees of yesterday's 
agreement's observance in practice? Apart from the joint 
communique, SLD continues to be practically deprived of an 
impact on what happens in URM, which means no impact on the 
day-to-day decisionmaking by the government. There are no SLD 
men in URM so you have no guarantees that the prime minister 
will observe the agreement. What did he tell SLD? 
  [Siemiatkowski] Ladies and Gentlemen, we are in favor of a 
thesis which says that politics conducted without the right 
principles, must backfire sooner or later. One of the 
principles in politics is keeping promises and obligations. Our 
view is that the signatures themselves which were placed under 
the communique must be proof enough of the goodwill by those who 
signed the communique. Those who placed these signatures must 
also be aware that the signature means something more than just 
the ink. 
  [Bninska] But at the very beginning of the conflict SLD 
expressed very harsh views on the prime minister and on the 
whole case. Day by day, the tone of the statements became less 
radical, until yesterday's shake-hands by Aleksander Kwasniewski 
and Waldemar Pawlak. How did you calculate this? Why was 
decreasing the tensions worth it for you? 
  [Siemiatkowski] It was not a calculation. All we did was to 
come to a conclusion at some point that we will no longer make 
the conflict more radical. 
  [Bninska] Why is that? 
  [Siemiatkowski] Because of the supreme interest in leading 
to a stabilization of Poland's political situation -- we were 
successful in achieving that, thanks to the establishment of the 
majority coalition which has such a huge support in the Sejm. 
The coalition has very important tasks before it, namely to 
solve problems resulting from the necessity of continuing with 
the reforms of our economy and of making permanent the 
democratic processes which are occurring in Poland, or which 
have been occurring for four years now. That is the supreme 
issue, and all the other issues are secondary. That is why we 
were even willing to give up our own ambitions, if we could only 
gain [words indistinct] 
  [Bninska, interrupting] If you could only remain in the 
governing coalition? 
  [Siemiatkowski] No, remaining in the governing coalition at 
any cost was not the issue. The issue was about being in a 
coalition which has the chances to implement a policy which is 
in accordance with the interests of those people who voted for 
SLD. I can assure you that if there comes a time when we reach 
the calculated conclusion that SLD's continued presence in any 
kind of association with the authorities, or in a coalition, is 
not in accordance with the interests of those who had voted for 
us and with the interests of the entire society -- in that case 
we will not insist on keeping the posts which our colleagues 
currently occupy. And if we come to the conclusion that we can 
do more for our voters while being in the opposition, then we 
will switch to the opposition. But as of today, our view is 
that there is both a chance and a real possibility of 
implementing our election program while being in a governing 
coalition. Only when you are in power, do you have 
implementation instruments necessary for implementing an 
election program. 
  [Bninska] Thank you very much for the conversation. 
  [Siemiatkowski] Thank you.

  [Text] Warsaw, 9 Feb -- While commenting on the outcome of 
yesterday's coalition talks, Leszek Moczulski, KPN 
[Confederation for an Independent Poland] leader, told PAP: 
"Both sides are not yet mature enough to part. The coalition 
has been pasted together." For Moczulski it is only a formal 
blurring of the conflict and the next one may take place as 
early as in four weeks' time. 
  The KPN leader is of the opinion that none of the concrete 
matters have been resolved. It has not been explained, for 
example, what will be the government attitude towards 
privatization; whether it will be like that of Bogdan Pek, head 
of the ownership transformation commission, or that of Wieslaw 
Kaczmarek, minister for ownership transformations. The matter 
of the Ministry of Finance has not been resolved, Moczulski 
claims, except for agreeing that the ministerial post still 
belongs to the SLD [Democratic Left Alliance]. 
  Moczulski asks, does it mean agreement for, for example, Mr 
Sekula [head of the Main Customs Office] becoming the minister? 
According to him the SLD has no suitable candidates for the 
post, perhaps with the exception of professor Jozef Kaleta who, 
as Moczulski said, has different economic views. 
  Moczulski described the results of Tuesday's talks as an 
avoidance of important issues and an agreement that the 
existence of the coalition is in the interest of both sides.

  [Text] Warsaw, 9 Feb -- Asked by a PAP journalist to 
comment on views that while signing Borowski's resignation, the 
president exerted influence on reaching a quick agreement within 
the coalition, Andrzej Zakrzewski, head of the office for 
political services to the president, said that Lech Walesa "does 
not interfere with the coalition, but simply learns what the 
coalition and the government are `producing.'" 
  Zakrzewski added that the president signed Borowski's 
resignation "in accordance with the procedures." 
  "According to the president, what happened is the internal 
matter of the coalition and the government; the matter of 
observing the agreements and following the procedure of changes 
in the cabinet. The president has nothing to do with it, and he 
can only accept the changes, and this is what he did," 
Zakrzewski said. 
  Asked whether he does not think that the president accepted 
Borowski's resignation unexpectedly quickly, Zakrzewski replied: 
"The president is always quick."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Krzysztof Gottesman, under the "Observations" </F>
rubric] 
  [Text] The governing coalition, despite the agreement 
reached on Tuesday [9 February] night, is going through a 
serious crisis. In the middle of the budget debate, we first 
witnessed the recall of Deputy Finance Minister Stefan Kawalec, 
and a few days later -- the recall of Marek Borowski, deputy 
prime minister and finance minister. Among observers and 
politicians were, and probably still are, people who do not rule 
out the possibility of a split within the coalition. Some are 
already counting the votes in new configurations. A return to a 
state of balance may turn out to be short-lasting. 
  All this is happening seemingly before the eyes of the 
people. Seemingly -- because on television screens we can most 
often see first of all Polonezes, Mercedeses, and Lancias, in 
which participants of the talks arrive at various entrances; 
these are frequently back entrances. Sometimes we can see 
politicians entering a building: Either they have a not too 
intelligent joke to tell, or do not condescend to say anything 
to journalists' questions at all. Those who are criticizing 
their partners for not having an appropriate information policy 
are also acting this way. The prime minister's press secretary 
most often says that she has nothing to say. 
  It all changes a little when the politicians come to the 
conclusion that the situation is under control to such a degree 
that a few general sentences can be said about the reached 
agreement. This is exactly what happened yesterday night. The 
preparations for the meeting at Parkowa Street were made in 
strict secrecy. Journalists and photo reporters were constantly 
misled by all possible methods. 
  Especially at important moments, politicians have the right, 
and maybe the duty as well, to hold talks quietly, without any 
microphones and camera lenses. It is more than certain that 
appropriate services would be able to organize such a meeting of 
the coalition of the Democratic Left Alliance and Polish Peasant 
Party. However, if the prime minister -- the chairman of the 
greatest Deputies' Club, the Sejm speaker, and a few other 
politicians do not want to take advantage of such a possibility, 
then it is their duty to the public to issue information about 
such negotiations. No matter what the result is. Otherwise, no 
one should be surprised at the reluctant attitude of the mass 
media toward the authorities.

  [Text] A demonstration by Solidarity took place in Warsaw 
today, in protest against price increases, falling workers' 
incomes, and the increase of the number of unemployed. Changes 
in the budget for this year were demanded. 
  In a speech made before the office of the Council of 
Ministers, Union Chairman Marian Krzaklewski demanded the 
adoption by 15 March this year of the laws comprising the pact 
on the state enterprise. He announced that there will be further 
demonstrations if this is not done. Over and above that, he 
said that Solidarity is preparing its own draft constitution, 
one that is representativeof the entire independence-oriented 
and Solidarity sector. 
  The participants in the demonstration delivered petitions 
into the hands of Deputy Sejm Speaker Jozef Zych and Council of 
Ministers Office Head Michal Strak. In the petitions the trade 
unionists are demanding changes in the budget for this year that 
would allow for a decrease in the growing negative economic and 
social phenomena. 
  The participants in the demonstration included Jan 
Olszewski, 
Jan Parys, Adam Glapinski, and also groups from the Movement for 
the Republic and the Third Republic Movement. According to the 
police controlling traffic, around 30,000 people took part in 
the demonstration, and according to Marian Kraklewski around 
100,000.

  [Excerpts] Over 30,000 trade unionists from Solidarity have 
demonstrated in Warsaw against this year's draft budget, the 
decrease in incomes, and the increase in the numbers of 
unemployed. Solidarity Chairman Marian Kraklewski said that the 
demonstration today is solely a component in the struggle for 
welfare rights. However, he added that if the government does 
not fulfill the trade union postulates, Solidarity will organize 
successive demonstrations, this time directed against the 
government. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] In the view 
of 
the organizers, at least 40,000 trade unionists came to Warsaw. 
The police spoke of 30,000, but everyone was in accord in 
stating that the demonstration was an enormous one. The 
demonstrators demanded the cessation of increased energy and gas 
prices, an increase in expenditures on social welfare benefits, 
an active struggle against unemployment, the adoption by 15 
March of laws relating to the pact on the state enterprise, and 
a 2-percent increase in remuneration within the productive 
sphere. Solidarity Chairman Kraklewski warned that if the 
government does not take into account these postulates, then the 
next demonstrations will have a political character. 
  [Krzaklewski] [video shows Krzaklewski marching in 
demonstration, talking to correspondent] If the government does 
not fulfill the social welfare and economic tasks in accordance 
with economic tendencies, and with the expectations of society, 
then the next stage is a demonstration against the authorities 
which are incapable of implementing something such as this. 
This is natural. Such is the course of affairs in democratic 
states. However, today's demonstration is not against the 
government but against the decisions and plans of this 
government. It is (?grinding us down). The next might be 
political. 
  [Correspondent] What do you think about the postulates 
contained in the Solidarity petition? 
  [Labor Minister Leszek Miller] It is difficult for me to 
agree with many of them. For instance, the shock increase in 
prices. The union is here doubtless thinking of the increase in 
the price of energy. Well, precisely. Instead of two large 
increases there will be three smaller ones. The rate in the 
increased prices of energy carriers is less this year than it 
was last year. Or else there is the accusation that the 
government is not implementing the earlier Solidarity 
postulates, normally when it is the pact on the state enterprise 
that is being spoken about. The laws comprising the pact have 
been sent to the Sejm. Two of them have already been adopted. 
The rest are at the disposal of the Sejm Extraordinary 
Commission. I think that they will shortly be adopted. To sum 
up, many of these postulates are quite simply being implemented. 
  [Correspondent] The demonstrators walked down the Royal Way, 
from Pilsudski Square to the office of the Council of Ministers 
[URM]. However, not all the trade unionists got there; when the 
head of the march was holding a rally before the URM, the end 
had not yet left Pilsudski Square, a few kilometers away. 
[passage omitted] The demonstrators also chanted before the 
seat of the government, Left leg there, fear God there, and Red 
rascals. After a few minutes, a trade union delegation entered 
the URM and presented URM Head Michal Strak with the Solidarity 
postulates. 
  [Strak] I accept this stance. I will pass it on to Prime 
Minister Pawlak. I wish to say that this government knows why 
and by whose votes it found itself here, where it finds itself. 
  [Correspondent] After the talks, Minister Strak tried to go 
out and meet the demonstrators. [passage omitted] The 
demonstration ran its course calmly. Nonetheless, its size meant 
that traffic in the center of Warsaw was paralyzed for several 
hours. [end recording] 
  [Announcer Malgorzata Szelewicka] Are you pleased with the 
course of the demonstration? 
  [Krzaklewski] I am pleased. I am edified by this enormous 
turnout and the determination shown today by union members. I 
do not agree of course with the figures that were given. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Szelewicka] Two days ago Premier Pawlak said on the 
Wiadomosci program that the government ought to break with the 
liberal policy of the previous governments. What is the union 
demonstrating against? 
  [Kraklewski] Well, we have demonstrated against obvious 
facts. Against the draft budget law, that in effect, according 
to our experts' stance too, will bring about a successive year 
of impoverishment for workers and their families. In addition, 
other families, those of pensioners and others. We cannot agree 
that in the third year of economic growth, the incomes of Polish 
families again decline. Such a rule, to the effect that with 
economic growth there is an increase in the incomes of employees 
and the incomes of families, is a certain fundamental rule of 
market systems, economic and social. It cannot be other than 
thus, for in that case when are the incomes of the populace to 
increase, if not with such a large economic growth as has been 
signalled in 1993, as is being signalled in 1994? 
  [Szelewicka] You said that the time might still come when 
there will be a struggle for power. When? 
  [Kraklewski] The time will come, above all, for the 
presentation of a stance toward the government, a political 
stance. At the moment, the government does not reflect upon this 
demonstration. I listened to the statement by Mr. Miller. It 
frightened me, especially after such a demonstration. I saw 
this enormous charge of tension, charge of hurt. After all, 
these people came in such numbers. 
  [Szelewicka] Why did that statement frighten you? 
  [Kraklewski] It frightened me because of its inaccurate 
reflection, on the evaluation of the mood that has accumulated 
in relation to this government policy. 
  [Szelewicka] The mood? 
  [Kraklewski] The mood is very radical. People came in such 
numbers because they really do feel bad. After all, they would 
not come because someone ordered them to. They feel very bad. 
They clearly feel this burden on their own backs. And we had 
to apply much of our authority and many measures putting things 
in order so as to control this enormous feeling. We controlled 
it thanks to the fact that these were trade union structures. 
If this had been a political demonstration, by everyone against 
the government, then I don't know what it would have looked like. 
  [Szelewicka] Many politicians of the right took part in the 
demonstration. Is this a foretaste of cooperation? 
  [Krzaklewski] I don't know if there were many. In relation 
to the number of demonstrators this is a very small percentage. 
We did not forbid anyone attending. 
  [Szelewicka] [Words indistinct] a significant number? 
  [Kraklewski] Yes, but in relation to almost 100,000 
demonstrators, according my calculations, a dozen or so or a few 
dozen politicians? These are, above all, politicians who 
supported this demonstration as a demonstration not only in 
favor of social welfare solutions, but as a demonstration for 
another economic program, one that the government ought to 
present. 
  [Szelewicka] Thank you very much. 
  [Kraklewski] Thank you very much.

  [Text] Pale, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Feb 10 (AFP) -- Bosnia's 
Serbs Thursday [10 February] rejected NATO's ultimatum to end 
their siege of Sarajevo and said their heavy weapons would not 
be removed from around the city. 
  "Despite this ultimatum, the Serb artillery will not move an 
inch," said their main spokesman, Miroslav Toholj. "We are ready 
to retaliate." 
  He called the NATO threat to hit Serb positions with air 
strikes if the artillery is not pulled back within 10 days as "a 
terrorist threat" and said the Serbs would respond "by all 
means" to any attack.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 9 Feb (TANJUG) -- Major General Manoljo 
Milovanovic, chief of the general staff of the army of the 
Srpska republic, stated this evening that a cease-fire coming 
into effect at noon tomorrow [10 February] was agreed at a 
meeting between Serb and Muslim military representatives this 
afternoon, with the mediation of General Michael Rose, UN 
Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  General Milovanovic said that an agreement was reached to 
place both Serb and Muslim artillery under UNPROFOR control for 
the duration of the cease-fire. 
  He explained that UNPROFOR has conveyed to the Muslim side 
the Serb side's proposal regarding the cease-fire and the 
setting up of a mixed military commission which will find ways 
to maintain the cease-fire. He added that the Muslim side has 
agreed to this. 
  The cease-fire will be guaranteed by UNPROFOR. Commissions 
will tour the entire front around Sarajevo in order to establish 
where these sensitive spots are and deploy UNPROFOR observers 
there to determine who is violating the truce, General 
Milovanovic stressed. 
  The chief of staff said he was surprised by General Rose's 
claim that some kind of an agreement was signed at today's 
meeting. He specified that nothing was signed and that all that 
was accomplished was a verbal agreement, whose details he cited. 
He emphasized that this is a truce and that the Muslim 
artillery is in no way exempt from it. 
  General Milovanovic added that UNPROFOR and the Serb and 
Muslim sides have assumed responsibility for inspecting all 
positions through mixed military commissions and devising ways 
to maintain the truce. These ways will be discussed tomorrow.

  [Excerpts] Geneva, Feb 10 (AFP) -- Warring parties in the 
Bosnian conflict are to hold fresh peace talks here Thursday [10 
February], just hours after NATO threatened to intervene with 
air strikes but also amid hopes that a hurried truce in Sarajevo 
will last. 
  Bosnian Serb and Moslem military officials agreed in 
principle Wednesday on a Sarajevo ceasefire, due to come into 
effect at midday Thursday (1100 GMT), and pledged to remove 
their heavy weapons from around the beseiged capital, UN local 
commander General Michael Rose said. [passage omitted] 
  The head of the self-declared Bosnian Serb parliament, 
Momcilo Krajisnik, meanwhile cast immediate doubts on ceasefire 
deal, worked out at Sarajevo airport. 
  He said the Serbs would announce the conditions under which 
they would withdraw their heavy artillery at Thursday's talks 
here. [passage omitted] 
  The agreement was given a cautious welcome by EC mediator 
Lord Owen, who said: "People sign things and don't always live 
up to them." 
  But he added: "Frankly I think (the agreement) will prove to 
be a lot more productive (than NATO air strikes)." 
  Rose had announced after the airport meeting that he had 
reached the agreement "with full consent of their political and 
military authorities." 
  But confusion arose when Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic 
reported that the truce airport agreement included a five-day 
deadline for implementation. 
  That was immediately denied by the UN Protection Forces, and 
a spokesman, who asked to remain anonymous stressed: "Mr. 
Izetbegovic's version is very different. And since no document 
was signed, for the moment this is only a verbal agreement." 
  The second-in-command of the mainly-Moslem Bosnian Army 
Jovan 
Divjak, who was also present at the three-hour airport meeting, 
said he had no faith in the accord. 
  "It's a game by the Serbs to get out of the bind they are in 
after the massacre they carried out the other day." [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Bosnian Prime Minister Haris </F>
Silajdzic in Geneva by Huda al-Husayni in London; date not given] 
  [Text] Following the cease-fire agreement reached in 
Sarajevo between the Bosnian Serbs and Muslims there, Bosnian 
Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic said over the telephone that a 
cease-fire had been agreed in Sarajevo after Serbian forces 
agreed to withdraw their heavy artillery for a distance of 30 km 
from Sarajevo. Silajdzic hoped that this would be the beginning 
of a new phase, "but no one knows whether or not the Serbs are 
going to implement it." 
  As is known, General Michael Rose, commander of the UN 
forces 
in Bosnia, said that he expects the agreement to be implemented 
fully as of midday today, Thursday. 
  We asked Haris Silajdzic: Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev said yesterday (Wednesday) that Russia is against 
launching air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions. However, it 
supports making Sarajevo a UN protectorate. He said that Russia 
could send forces to implement the plan. 
  Haris Silajdzic said: We have not asked for Russian forces 
to be sent to Sarajevo. 
  [Al-Husayni] They are willing to come. 
  [Silajdzic] We have not requested any. 
  [Al-Husayni] Have you requested French, British, Ukrainian 
forces? 
  [Silajdzic] And forces from Islamic states. 
  [Al-Husayni] So you reject the dispatch of Russian forces to 
you. 
  [Silajdzic] I said we have not requested any. 
  [Al-Husayni] The Bosnian parliament proposed Bosnia's 
partition into four cantons.... 
  [Silajdzic] It was the Croatian, not Bosnian, parliament 
which proposed Bosnia's partition into 18 cantons. The problem 
is that people do not follow the news of what is happening. 
  [Al-Husayni] Your representative to the United Nations 
agreed to Sarajevo's being turned into a demilitarized zone. Do 
you too agree to that? 
  [Silajdzic] We have not agreed to the demilitarization of 
Sarajevo, nor have we spoken about this matter. 
  [Al-Husayni] Your representative told British television 
that your agree. 
  [Silajdzic] A representative is a representative and a 
government is a government, of course. 
  [Al-Husayni] As a government, do you refuse to turn Sarajevo 
into a demilitarized zone? 
  [Silajdzic] No one has asked for demilitarization or 
nondemilitarization. UN Security Council Resolution 836 
stipulates the Serbian forces' withdrawal and we are in the 
process of implementing this resolution. 
  [Al-Husayni] You are now in Geneva for the sake of 
implementing this resolution. 
  [Silajdzic] We are here for the sake of negotiations. 
  [Al-Husayni] What about the resolution's implementation? 
  [Silajdzic] It should be implemented on the ground. 
  [Al-Husayni] In brief, what peace plan is the Bosnian 
Government taking to Geneva? 
  [Silajdzic] It is an expanded plan. We are carrying plans, 
programs, and pages. I am carrying with me 10 kg of pages and 
papers full of proposals. 
  [Al-Husayni] What is your opinion of NATO's decision to 
issue an ultimatum to the Serbs before launching air strikes? 
Do you believe it is serious? 
  [Silajdzic] It is a serious organization, and I expect it to 
issue nothing but serious things. It is a very big 
organization, a world organization, the strongest military 
organization in the world, and its statements are bound to be 
serious. We take all its decisions seriously. 
  [Al-Husayni] Do you expect an air strike to be launched? 
  [Silajdzic] We expect nothing. We are awaiting the results 
of the NATO session, then we will see what is going to happen.

  [Text] Geneva, Feb 10 (AFP) -- Bosnian Prime Minister Haris 
Silajdzic said peace may be at hand this time in Bosnia. 
  "There is a line that has been crossed," he said, the line 
being the willingness to use force as NATO issued an ultimatum 
Wednesday [9 February] for an end to shelling of Sarajevo and 
withdrawal of heavy weapons. 
  It "might be the first step towards disengagement," he said. 
  Asked by AFP at his hotel here if the peace initiative would 
really work, after so many have failed, Silajdzic said: "I 
think it will." 
  Silajdzic is in Geneva for a Bosnian peace conference 
opening 
Thursday. 
  He said the withdrawal of the artillery of the besieging 
Serbs from around Sarajevo would not change the strategic 
balance since it is "not true you can protect troops with 
artillery." He said the only purpose of the Serb artillery was 
"to attack civilians." 
  Military experts in Sarajevo consider, however, that the 
Serbs' artillery advantage enables them to offset the numerical 
superiority of the mainly Moslem Bosnian troops defending the 
city against a 22-month Serb siege. 
  Silajdzic said that the NATO ultimatum could lead to a 
"balance of power and with a balance of power you will have 
peace." He denied that the Bosnians were outnumbered since he 
said they were fighting not just Bosnian Serb forces but troops 
from Serbia. "They can bring out more troops at any time," 
Silajdzic said.

<F P=106> [Report by Zoran Pirolic] </F>
  [Text] The negotiating process, which in recent days more 
or less progressed visibly within Sarajevo and outside it, 
simultaneous with NATO threats that it would bomb the Serb 
positions around the capital, culminated in a result whose true 
form, significance, and consequences still remain to be seen. 
  General Michael Rose, commander of the UN forces in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, who presided over the negotiations between 
the representatives of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the 
aggressor, Serbian side, this afternoon said that this was a 
very small step in solving a very great problem. According to 
his words, the agreement has three basic points. 
  [Begin Rose recording in English] ....that there should be 
an immediate cease-fire in and around the city.... [end Rose 
recording] 
  [Words indistinct] and that there will no more attacks on 
the 
city or from within the city; second, that the UN peace forces 
would be posted at all key and sensitive locations outside of 
the city; third, that all heavy weaponry would be placed under 
UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] control; and fourth, that a joint 
commission would be formed to oversee this task. The joint 
commission would be headed by French General Andre (Subirou), 
commander of the UNPROFOR sector in Sarajevo. A series of 
details, and the establishment of locations for posting the Blue 
Helmets, will still have to be agreed, said General Rose. 
According to him, this might be the beginning of a 
normalization of life for Sarajevo citizens. The British 
general said that the cease-fire would go into effect at 1200 
[1100 GMT] tomorrow [10 February], and that Brigadier General 
(Subirou) would deploy his troops as soon as possible. Asked to 
state the difference between today's and earlier agreements that 
were violated practically at the moment they were signed, 
General Rose said that the difference was that this time 
Karadzic's Serb army was ready to withdraw its heavy weaponry 
and to place it under the efficient control of the peace forces. 
This can be a result of the changed strategic circumstances in 
which they have found themselves, added the British general. 
  There were no conflicts regarding the definition of heavy 
weaponry, and Sir Michael Rose maintains that all weapons whose 
caliber exceeds 12.7-mm will be placed under control. The other 
question that could prove to be controversial, and that the 
aggressor's side will try to manipulate, is the distance to 
which the heavy weaponry should be withdrawn. General Rose 
believes that this issue is not of paramount importance, and 
that if a distance of some 30 km around Sarajevo is agreed upon, 
there are bound to be areas that are not appropriate for placing 
heavy artillery. UNPROFOR will work on placing this weaponry 
under as tight control as possible. This, of course, also 
includes the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army's heavy artillery. 
  There is no minimal distance from the city if the heavy 
artillery is under our control, said General Rose. No 
signatures were put on the agreement reached at Sarajevo 
airport, yet the Brit does not deem this to be a particularly 
significant detail. He said that the negotiations between the 
representatives of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the Serbian 
side continued and that they concerned a series of details 
connected to the agreement. The Brit said that he had met with 
President Izetbegovic today around noon, and that the president 
of the Presidency of our country asked for clarifications on 
three or four points, after which he authorized the military 
representatives of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army to come to the 
airport and agree to the agreement. 
  In response to a question pertaining to the possibility of 
air strikes against the Serb artillery if the agreement is not 
observed, General Rose said: 
  I will keep my thoughts to myself, and leave the decision to 
General Jean Cot and Mr. Yasushi Akashi. He was optimistic when 
he added that everyone was now facing a complete change, but we 
have heard these words, in one form or another, from other 
commanders of the peace forces in Bosnia.

<F P=106> [Zoran Babic report on news conference by President Alija </F>
Izetbegovic and members of the Bosnia-Herzegovina military 
delegation Generals Jovan Divjak, Mustafa Hajrulahovic, and 
Brigadier Ismet Dahic in Sarajevo on 9 February -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Babic] At the beginning of the conference, while 
explaining to the correspondents the reasons why this news 
conference was called, President Alija Izetbegovic said: 
  [Izetbegovic] After the meeting, General Rose made a 
statement for the press that was neither precise nor clear 
enough. That is why I would like to clarify for our public the 
conclusion reached at the meeting. We concluded that a 
cease-fire should go into effect on the Sarajevo front tomorrow 
[10 February] at 1200 [1100 GMT]. At 1200, UN Protection Force 
[UNPROFOR] patrols should proceed to the following locations: 
Zuc, Golo Brdo, Borije, Vidikovac, Grbavica, that is, the 
Brotherhood and Unity Bridge, and Dobrinja to establish whether 
the cease-fire is being observed, so that we can proceed to the 
next phase, which is collecting heavy Serbian weaponry. 
  We will collect all the heavy weaponry -- that is, all of 
the 
Serbian weaponry over a 12.7-mm caliber. According to our 
estimate, this phase would, according to today's agreement, last 
some five days, after which the weapons would be immobilized; 
therefore, demobilized, rendered useless, ammunition and 
artillery pieces would be sorted out into separate groups and 
would be placed in a row of barracks where it could be 
efficiently controlled by UNPROFOR, or rather where efficient 
control would be possible. The enemy has accepted these 
conditions and, therefore, they came; I think that their 
delegation was headed by their chief of staff, General 
Milovanovic. [sentence as heard] Prior to beginning the talks, 
they announced that they had been fully authorized for this 
meeting pertaining to the withdrawal of heavy weaponry. If this 
agreement is not implemented, we will consider today's agreement 
invalid. 
  [Babic] Generals Jovan Divjak and Mustafa Hajrulahovic 
contributed additional clarifications. 
  [Divjak] We exclusively discussed the cease-fire and decided 
that UNPROFOR should set up control posts in order to establish 
if the cease-fire is being violated. What is important is the 
fact that the Serb army must withdraw its artillery in the next 
five days and place it in those areas where UNPROFOR forces will 
be able to control it. General Rose implied that during the 
next phase -- since this agreement will be carried out in phases 
-- we will discuss other provisions of Resolution 824. However, 
this is conditioned by the withdrawal of the artillery and its 
being placed under control as requested by our delegation. 
  [Hajrulahovic] I believe that we should stress that we know 
in detail the number of chetnik weapons and artillery pieces 
around Sarajevo; we know all the coordinates of these weapons -- 
artillery pieces, that is -- so, in order to avoid a regrouping 
of the forces, we proposed submitting a complete map with all 
the [word indistinct] weapons and artillery pieces. This would 
serve to prevent the aggressor's side from regrouping the 
weapons on some other part of the front in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Babic] One of the questions for President Izetbegovic 
pertained to what the Bosnian side intended to undertake if the 
Serbs should violate the cease-fire. 
  [Izetbegovic] We believe that as of 1200 tomorrow, and in 
the course of the next five days, the withdrawal of heavy 
weapons and the establishment of the locations to which it 
should be withdrawn should begin. Therefore, we shall consider 
that the agreement has been violated if the Serb side refuses to 
withdraw the heavy weaponry, if in the meantime an attack, a 
bombardment of the city should occur, and if the snipers do not 
refrain from their activities. We will then consider the 
agreement invalid. 
  [Babic] In response to what would happen to the Bosnian 
weapons, Izetbegovic said: 
  [Izetbegovic] All this is being done in accordance with 
Resolutions 824 and 836, according to which we are not under any 
obligation to put any type of weaponry under [UNPROFOR] control. 
This does not mean that we are not ready to place our heavy 
weaponry under control. However, we are under no obligation to 
do so, but this does not exclude our readiness to do so. We 
will probably do so, providing the Serbs place their weapons 
under control. However, this is the first task that needs to be 
accomplished.

  [Text] Belgrade, 9 Feb (TANJUG) -- General Milan Gvero, 
deputy chief of the general staff of the army of the Srpska 
republic, told TANJUG today that the UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] command in ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina has informed him that 
it will no longer tolerate the inspection of cargo carried by 
humanitarian convoys. He made it clear that he had received 
this message from General Angus Ramsey, UNPROFOR headquarters 
commander. 
  Gvero interprets this decision as an increase in the various 
pressures and threats aimed in recent days at the people of the 
Srpska republic as well as its political leadership and army. 
"Regrettably, it seems that this is being pursued by the 
international institutions present in this area whose mission 
should be of a peacemaking and unbiased nature," Gen. Gvero 
said. "Today, Gen. Ramsey phoned me and said that UNPROFOR had 
decided to refuse any inspection of their convoys," he said. "In 
other words, they regard checking convoys as an infringement of 
their freedom of movement." 
  Gvero, however, stresses that because of a large number of 
attempts to abuse these convoys the Serb side cannot tolerate 
their movement without checking their cargo. "We, just like the 
entire civilized world, regard inspection as a method of 
confidence-building rather than a curb on movement. No good 
would come of pushing through, in this way, a decision to refuse 
any inspection of their convoys," he said. "In other words, they 
regard checking convoys as an infringement of their freedom of 
movement." 
  Gvero also said that the Serb side has a report that UNHCR 
staff have been ordered to leave their offices on the territory 
of the Srpska republic. "We are checking this report and if it 
is true we shall prevent them from fleeing our territory," he 
said. "None of the measures taken by these institutions and 
organizations have been caused in any way by our conduct or 
actions." 
  "We do not accept ultimatums of any kind, while we are 
ready, 
just as we have been so far, for any kind of equitable and 
civilized cooperation," Gen. Gvero said in conclusion.

<F P=106> [By TANJUG editor in chief Dusan Zupan; "pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 9 (TANJUG) -- If logic and evidence 
still have any meaning in this world of ours, the Serb side has 
provided more than convincing arguments to prove that it could 
not have been responsible for the tragedy at a Sarajevo open air 
market on Saturday. 
  Most of the allegations presented by the Muslim authorities, 
from the allegations about the number of dead (68) and wounded 
(197) to those about the causes of the explosion, have been 
disproved by photos from the scene of the tragedy and subsequent 
analyses of technical details by experts who have warned that 
the incident has no doubt been stage-managed. 
  There is always a motive for every crime, including the one 
in Sarajevo. It is completely overlooked that the effect of the 
massacre has not been the same in the case of all the interested 
sides. 
  Croats, who have been on the brink of coming under the blow 
of international sanctions because of their military 
intervention in Bosnia, now breath more easily. Zagreb is no 
longer the focus of international criticism. 
  As for the Muslims, they have temporarily quieted the 
mounting dissatisfaction in the world over their increasingly 
clearer commitment to the continuation of the war and not peace 
talks. 
  After the joint visit to Sarajevo of the Turkish and 
Pakistani prime ministers, conceived as a political propaganda 
attraction, failed to produce the desired effect, Muslim 
strategists in Sarajevo once again decided to apply the earlier 
tested formula -- blood and carnage -- as the most effective and 
efficient means of the battle for domination in the former 
Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The strong inclination of the Muslim leadership to resort to 
the above formula was clearly recorded on July 14, 1992 by the 
then U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) Commander in Bosnia Lewis 
Mackenzie in a letter to the then UNPROFOR commander, Indian 
General Satish Nambiar and ranking U.N. official Marrack 
Goulding, according to a decoded text of the letter, a copy of 
which TANJUG has. Canadian General Mackenzie described in the 
letter, among other things, his conversation with Bosnian Muslim 
leader Alija Izetbegovic. 
  ``My conversation yesterday has convinced me once and for 
all 
that the president will only accept intervention or death for 
`his' people as final solution (his words). There have been 
many opportunities for negotiations over the past few days, 
which he has rejected, including an overture by his SDA party, 
who wanted to meet with the Serbs...he (Izetbegovic) indicated 
that if the international community was not prepared to 
intervene, than he was prepared to "die twice," rather than deal 
with the "aggressor." 
  "Indications in Sarajevo point to a desire by the presidency 
(Muslim) to perpetuate the current crisis." 
  General Mackenzie was compelled to withdraw from his post 
and 
go into retirement, among other reasons, because he wrote in the 
letter, "They (Muslims) could target us, and try to make it look 
like the Serbs did it." It is more than obvious that the Bosnian 
Muslim policy has not changed and it is, therefore, not at all 
surprising that Muslims prevented unbiased experts from 
conducting a regular investigation at the scene of the event, 
from performing autopsies, and examining wounds. 
  According to the latest indications by reliable sources, 
UNPROFOR has this time again mustered the strength to send to 
the U.N. headquarters a report saying that the Muslim side is 
reponsible for the crime at the Sarajevo market. It remains to 
be seen whether an extra effort will be made and the report be 
published. If so, it will be a headway compared with the case 
of the concealed report about the massacre in Save Miskin Street 
(in 1992), which was used as a prelude to the introduction of 
the sanctions against Yugoslavia. The concealing of the latest 
facts, or their possible forging, could be used as a pretext for 
air strikes against the Serbs. 
  Not only Croats and Muslims have emerged as "winners" from 
the massacre in Sarajevo, but also western media, which have 
again a priori and in chorus condemned the Serbs as the side 
responsible for the crime. The tragedy at Sarajevo's Markale 
market was given high priority by media, especially CNN TV, 
which will bring new clients, higher circulation or rating, and 
more advertisements to those advocates of war while they await 
the next media attraction, if possible air strikes against 
Serbs, which they have openly been calling for. It is most 
likely for that reason that foreign news agencies on Tuesday 
evening said nothing about TANJUG's report that there exists of 
an UNPROFOR report which says that the Muslims are reponsible 
for the latest massacre in Sarajevo. 
  What a paradox. The only losers have been Serbs, because, 
even if they are not bombed, they have again been satanized 
before a large part of the world public and have a priori been 
charged as criminals and the guilty side. The only consolation 
is that it is beyond doubt that "lies have short wings" and that 
in the long run, no matter how long it takes, the anti-Serb 
propaganda will boomerang. 
  It is up to the world public to decide whether the latest 
Muslim-staged incident will, despite all the available facts, 
including the UNPROFOR report, and without a serious 
international investigation, be used to launch air strikes 
against the Bosnian Serbs. If it is, many things could become 
so complicated that they would get out of control. 
  It is for that reason that the United Nations, that is, 
those 
who rule the world organization, should at least this time 
follow the advice of Canadian General Mackenzie that Izetbegovic 
"must be forced to the table" to negotiate. 
  For as long as that it is not done, there will be new 
Markalas and unnecessary innocent casualties.

  [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 9 (TANJUG) -- A man with glasses, 
filmed by the British television station SKY NEWS a day after 
the massacre at the Sarajevo market on Saturday, is an expert 
for remote control, TANJUG learned on Wednesday. 
  Fahrudin Orucevic, an electronics engineer, is the director 
of a military institute. He was recognized by a collegue from 
work who was watching the SKY NEWS program. 
  The footage, broadcast by Belgrade Television on Tuesday, 
shows Orucevic trying to avoid a British reporter who asked him 
what he was doing at the market as he was seen measuring 
something. He then walked away, ran across the street and 
entered a parked vehicle. 
  His former collegue, who asked not to be named in order not 
to jeopardize the security of a number of people from the 
institute, categorically claims that Orucevic could have been in 
charge of a timer -- part of the mine which exploded at the 
Sarajevo market. 
  He claims that, before the war, Orucevic was employed in 
Sarajevo's firm SDU which manufacutred remote control systems, 
and that one year before the start of the war he was in Turkey 
as the manager of the remote control in a mine. 
  As soon as the war broke out, Orucevic was appointed as 
director of the Unis Institute, one of the numerous military 
factories in the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
which manufacture weapons and ammunition for the Moslem army. 
  Unis was founded and managed by current Moslem Presidency 
Vice-Presidemt Ejup Ganic who is one of the leading ideologists 
of the fundamentalist Islamic followers of Alija Izetbegovic.

<F P=106> [Report by Mirza Sadikovic] </F>
  [Text] For the fifth day running the chetnik hordes are 
carrying out attacks with all available means. They are bringing 
new forces and hardware all the time and are constantly 
attacking Bihac and the Cazin commune. 
  (?Four) brigades of the Serbian aggressor reinforced with 
police units from Banja Luka, Prijedor, Drvar, and 200 artillery 
pieces of various kinds have already been on the offensive for 
five days now, destroying civilian facilities and (?pounding) 
every millimeter of the defense line. The attacks with 155-mm 
howitzers, multiple rocket launchers, tanks, and mortars of all 
calibers are horrific, but the defenders, who are defending the 
Bihac region and Bosnia- Herzegovina bare-handed, have put up 
heroic resistance. In brief, this is the picture of what 
happened on the (?Grmusko-Srbljanski) plateau, Hasin Vrh, and 
Barakovac last night and this morning. 
  The chetniks are attacking in waves, treading over their 
dead 
comrades, and leaving them behind. This illustrates sufficiently 
that their intentions are to enter Bihac. There is hand-to-hand 
fighting. 
  According to the old recipe, the chetniks are trying to make 
up for every failure to breach the lines by attacking civilian 
facilities. According to the unconfirmed reports, several 
civilians have been wounded. Some of them have been killed. 
There are a large number of wounded defenders. Material damage 
is immeasurable. 
  The Assembly of the Bihac Commune and the Command of the 5th 
Corps have again contacted the UN and UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] vehemently protesting, reminding the sleepy 
international community of the fact that it has declared this 
very region to be a protected zone, of Resolution 836, of the 
bloody rampage of the Serbian aggressor, and of the suffering of 
the innocent. 
  Stocks of food have long ago run out. The overcrowded 
hospitals are without medicines. Humanitarian aid has not 
arrived for a long time. This is all being watched with 
indifference by those who issued new ultimata and alleged 
threats yesterday. Will the new massacres, victims, and 
suffering of a nation again be allowed in front of everyone? 
  The morale of the defenders, the heroes of the 5th Corps, is 
exceptional. The support of the people from all sections of the 
free parts of the region is limitless. There are more and more 
volunteers who are arriving to join the units to defend, as they 
say, their region and human dignity with their bodies. While we 
are reporting fierce hand-to-hand fighting is under way on the 
(Grmusko-Srbljanski) plateau and Barakovac. Artillery shells 
are showering down on every part of the defenders' line and the 
entire Bihac region. A message is being sent from every part of 
this region: Bihac will be defended, regardless of the fact 
that more chetniks are being brought. According to information 
available at present, some 2,000 chetniks are on their way.

  [Text] The Serbian aggressor is continuing the fiercest 
offensive to date against Bihac Commune. The offensive has now 
entered its fourth day. Mirza Sadikovic reports: 
  They have been attacking the (Grmusko-Srbljanski) plateau, 
[name indistinct], and Barakovac throughout the day, that is, 
they are persistently shelling the forward defense lines on the 
Bihac part of the front. In addition to this, they have 
continued to shell Bihac and the outskirts of (Kakanj) Commune. 
Our defenders are in full control of their positions [words 
indistinct]. The 5th Corps Command has lodged another protest 
with the UN Protection Force over the shelling of Bihac, while 
Hamdija Kadilic, chairman of the communal assembly, has also 
lodged a sharp protest with the United Nations over the bestial 
attack on Bihac Commune, which has been declared a safe haven.

  The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army has successfully repelled the

  [Text] The fiercest enemy offensive hitherto is continuing 
in the zone of operations of the 7th South Operative Group. The 
offensive on the free territories of the Tesanj, Maglaj, Doboj, 
and Teslic communes has been going on for 25 days. The most 
difficult situation was in the zone of operations of the 203d 
Glorious Motorized Brigade of Doboj-Bosnia. After crossing the 
Usora River, the chetniks attacked Karusce, where they were 
successfully repelled as they have been on so many occasions in 
the past. Two hours later, a chetnik sabotage group was 
infiltrated in this region, but it fared in the same way as all 
the previous ones. The 110th Glorious Usora Brigade told us 
that over 500 projectiles of all calibers landed on the defense 
lines in this area overnight. 
  The enemy's forces and hardware were repositioned in the 
operational zone of the 207th and 202d brigades this morning. 
The [Serbian] aggressor is preparing an artillery and infantry 
attack.

  [Excerpt] Zvornik, Feb 9 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslems and 
Bosnian Croats on Wednesday continued their fierce fighting at 
unabated intensity in southern and central parts of this 
ex-Yugoslav republic, Bosnian Serb army sources said. 
  Their fighting was the fiercest in southern Bosnia and in 
the 
Mostar region, then outside Vitez, Kiseljak, Zepca and 
Zavidovici. 
  Sources of the two sides indirectly confirm that the Moslems 
were sustaining big losses in central Bosnia. 
  Inter-Moslem armed provocations also continued in the 
Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia (APWB), as tensions were 
mounting amongst local population ahead of the expiration on 
Thursday of the deadline set by the fifth command of Bosnian 
Moslem forces loyal to the Moslem authorities in Sarajevo. The 
ultimatum wanted an unconditional surrender by the APWB forces. 
  The APWB signed separate peace with Bosnian Serbs and 
Bosnian 
Croats, striving for a peaceful solution to the three-nations 
conflict in the central ex-Yugoslav republic. 
  Moslem forces in the past 24 hours continued provocations 
and 
offensive actions towards the Serb side on a number of 
battlefronts. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Ali Moghnie in Sarajevo, incorporating interview </F>
with "high-ranking Bosnian Muslim military commander" Rustum 
Kadic --- date not given: "Muslims Ready To Launch Spring 
Military Offensive"] 
  [Text] The Bosnian Muslims are preparing to launch an 
attack against Dolina rijeke Lasva (the valley of the river 
Lasva) between Zenica and Mostar in the spring to consolidate 
their position around Sarajevo, according to a high-ranking 
Bosnian Muslim military commander. 
  In an interview with The European, Rustum Kadic said the 
attack would be directed against Novi Travnik (half of it 
already controlled by the Muslims and the other half by the 
Croats), Vitez (the Muslims control the old part of the city) 
and Busovaca, Kiseljak, and Kresevo (all under Croat control). 
  But in the light of the mortar attack on Sarajevo's market 
square, the plan may be revised. Air strikes on Serbian 
positions around the town, or any Nato-induced withdrawal by the 
Serbs, would offer the tempting option of an immediate push by 
the Muslims to follow up and gain territory. 
  Such a move, which the UN would undoubtedly try to prevent, 
could signal the start of the Muslims' spring offensive, which 
has a series of objectives, according to Kadic. They want to 
break the Serbian ring around Sarajevo by liberating Kiseljak, 
near Vitez, and reduce their own commitment in the area to 
redeploy forces on other fronts, Kadic said. They also want to 
capture vital arms factories in Novi Travnik and Vitez, and aim 
to supplant the Croats in controlling the relief aid routes. 
  If the Muslims gain control of Kiseljak, they will be able 
to 
cut the Croats' supply lines from the Serbs in the east. By 
controlling Busovaca the Muslims would ease links along the 
valley, currently dominated by Croat snipers who are inflicting 
heavy casualties on the Muslims. According to Bosnian military 
commanders, more than 1,000 Muslim fighters have died on that 
road. 
  There is already heavy fighting between the Muslim-led 
Bosnian army and Croat separatist forces in the Vitez area which 
closed the main aid route into the Croat enclave. 
  "We can achieve our aims. However there is a risk of a large 
number of casualties," Kadic said. "When we took back Kakanj 
and Vares, the Croatian fighters took shelter in Kiseljak, which 
became a fortress." 
  Muslim politicians in Sarajevo oppose the plan because of 
potential losses. But Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic backs 
the military commanders. The military headquarters of the 
Bosnian Muslims has been transferred to Zenica from Sarajevo.

  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 9 (TANJUG) -- The command of the 
United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in the war-torn 
former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina has notified the 
command of the Bosnian Serb army that they will no longer allow 
them to control the contents of shipments in humanitarian aid 
convoys, Assistant Commander of the Serb Army Milan Gvero told 
TANJUG on Wednesday. 
  General Gvero was told the decision by the Commander of 
UNPROFOR Headquarters in Bosnia-Herzegovina British General 
Angus Ramsey, judging the Serb control of convoy contents to be 
"an infringement on the freedom of movement." 
  Due to many attempts at abusing these convoys, the Serb army 
cannot let any convoys transit without controlling the contents, 
Gvero stressed. 
  The Serbs also learn that the staff of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) received orders to leave 
their offices and territory of the Serb Bosnian Republic during 
the day, Gvero continued. 
  "We are checking the information and if it turns to be true 
we will prevent them from leaving our territory," the general 
said. 
  "We reject any ultimatums, and we are ready as always to 
cooperate as equals in a civilized way," Gvero said. 
  Gvero set out that neither of the latest UNPROFOR and UNHCR 
measures was provoked by actions or behavior of the Bosnian 
Serbs. 
  Humanitarian aid convoys for the Moslems have passed through 
the territory of the Bosnian Serb Republic easily and safely, 
the reports of UNPROFOR and UNHCR confirmed. 
  On the other side Moslems have often attacked and robbed 
humanitarian convoys, one of the latest incidents happened in 
Zenica (central Bosnia) when Moslems killed an Englishman, 
humanitarian aid truck driver. 
  Gvero commented the decision as the intensification of 
recent 
different pressures on and threats to the Bosnian Serbs. 
  "We, as the whole civilized world, consider control as a 
method of building confidence, not limiting of the freedom of 
movement. It would not be good to create artificially in this 
way situations conducive to incidents which would then serve as 
a pretext for hasty reckless other actions," Gvero said in the 
end.

<F P=106> [By Jean-Michel Stoullig] </F>
  [Text] Geneva, Feb 9 (AFP) -- Foreign ministers from seven 
countries neighbouring ex-Yugoslavia met here Wednesday [9 
February] to discuss the Bosnian crisis amid calls for NATO air 
strikes as Austria called for "the necessary action" to halt the 
carnage. 
  Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock told the UN Human 
Rights 
Commission here before the ministers' meeting that "such 
terrible crimes cannot be accepted by civilized societies at the 
end of the 20th century." "The international comunity must take 
the necessary action to stop them," he said. 
  Wednesday's talks here coincided with a meeting in Brussels 
of North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ambassadors debating 
whether to give the Bosnian Serbs a deadline to lift the siege 
of Sarajevo or face air strikes by the alliance's warplanes. 
  But Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, who had been 
invited here by international mediators David Owen and Thorvald 
Stoltenberg, decided to stay in Ankara to "remain close to his 
government" pending any NATO decision, an official said. 
Pro-Moslem Turkey is a NATO member and on Wednesday said it was 
prepared to take part in any NATO air strikes in Bosnia. 
  Pro-Serb Greece meanwhile said it would go along with any 
NATO decision. 
  Ministers in attendance at the talks here were Mock, 
Albania's Alfred Serreqi, Bulgaria's Stanislav Daskalov, 
Greece's Karolos Papoulias, Italy's Beniamino Andreatta, 
Romania's Teodor Melescanu and Hungary's Secretary of State for 
Foreign Affairs Janos Hermann. 
  None made a statement as they went into the meeting, which 
was also to focus on a 60-page document detailing the economic 
effects on the Balkans of the 1992 trade embargo against 
Belgrade. 
  Owen and Stoltenberg want "to have the ministers' input on 
the issues of reconstruction and recovery in advance of a 
settlement," an official said. No statement was due to be 
issued after the session. 
  The meeting had been scheduled before Saturday's massacre of 
68 Bosnians at the Sarajevo market which triggered the latest 
debate on whether to use air power against Bosnian Serbs. 
  Meanwhile, Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic held talks 
with Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic ahead of a fresh 
round of multilateral Geneva talks from Thursday aimed at 
reaching a political settlement. They said at the half-way 
stage that their discussions had been "constructive." 
  Granic said they had covered ways to end hostilities between 
Bosnian Croat forces and the mainly Moslem Bosnian Government 
Army in central Bosnia. The Zagreb government has denied UN 
allegations that its own troops are engaged in the fighting. 
  Croatia itself will not be represented at Thursday's talks 
here, which are intended to work out "confidence-building 
measures" by the three sides to the Bosnian conflict, 
represented by Silajdzic, Radovan Karadzic for the Bosnian Serbs 
and Mile Akmadzic for the Bosnian Croats.

  [Text] The cabinet is in session in Prague today. Jitka 
Kucerova phoned in this report. 
  [Kucerova] The cabinet has decided on the participation of 
the Czech Republic in the Partnership for Peace program. The 
so-called presentation document will be submitted by 31 March. 
The individual program of the Czech Republic in this project 
will be worked out on its basis. 
  The government also discussed the situation of national 
minorities. Vaclav Klaus said the following on this question: 
Our point of departure is no discrimination against minorities. 
The government, however, does not intend to set up any special 
institution to discuss these problems. 
  A draft amendment to the law on land communications was also 
adopted. In practice, this will mean the introduction of the 
long-discussed motorway tax. The preliminary day of 
introduction is 1 January 1995.

  [Excerpts] Today the Hungarian National Assembly's Foreign 
Affairs Committee heard Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky's 
report on his visit in Belgrade on 27 January. He confirmed 
once again that Hungary is not going to initiate the lifting of 
the UN embargo. Peter Gyuricza reports from the Committee's 
meeting. 
  [Gyuricza] Events of the following months will prove whether 
changes in Belgrade politics -- which also made possible Foreign 
Minister Jeszenszky's visit -- have indeed taken place. The 
foreign minister said that these changes include the diminishing 
of psychological pressure on ethnic Hungarians in Vojvodina, 
reducing extremist manifestations, easing the tone of the 
Belgrade press, and decreasing the frequency of call-ups. 
  Geza Jeszenszky favorably viewed the fact that negotiations 
are under way between the Democratic Community of Hungarians in 
Vojvodina and the Serbian Government with regard to autonomy and 
its institutions. Geza Jeszenszky said that Hungary will not 
initiate lifting the UN Security Council embargo. At the same 
time, however, as a sovereign state guided by its national 
interests, it may believe that the time has come to hold talks 
about this with its partners and allies, especially since no way 
out can be seen. [passage omitted] Hungary is observing the UN 
Security Council resolution, stressed Geza Jeszenszky. [passage

<F P=106> [Article by Zeljko Kruselj: "Faith in Conspiracy"] </F>
  [Text] The already well-known report from the fourth 
session of the Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] Presidency on 
"the current political situation in Croatia" has recently also 
been published in THE HDZ HERALD. The report's significance lies 
in the fact that it was accompanied by a picture of the 
participants of the session, which is supposed to do most to 
deny "malicious misinformation about the alleged rift in the HDZ 
and replacement of its officials." In that picture, Stipe Mesic 
and Gojko Susak were seated next to Franjo Tudjman, and the 
seating arrangements -- to the president's left and to his right 
-- "ideologically" mirrors the division within the party, and so 
does the position of other "polemists." 
  However, the problem lies in the fact that the latest 
attempt 
to homogenize the ruling party should be secured primarily by 
means of a fierce attack on the opposition, which was this time 
accused of "destabilizing the democratic system." The report 
says that "the moves and demands of some opposition parties lead 
to a constitutional crisis and early elections, and thus 
obviously jeopardize the internal stability and the 
international position of the Republic of Croatia," and that 
their goal is "to cause dissatisfaction among the people and 
even stimulate strikes" in order to "provoke a constitutional 
crisis and overthrow the authorities." 
<H5>  "Scenario From Abroad" </H5>
  Jure Radic, HDZ secretary general, was even more direct 
during his visit last week to the county of Dubrovnik and 
Neretva, accusing unmentioned parties of betraying national 
interests. He spoke of "unwritten scenarios from abroad on how 
to destroy Croatian authorities that were elected in a 
democratic manner," and added that "some opposition parties have 
been receiving such scenarios for six months." The sharpness of 
Radic's statement may stem from the fact that he made it in 
Cavtat, i.e., exactly where the present authorities are being 
severely criticized for negotiating the possible "trading of the 
territory of southern Dalmatia," so it would be wise to redirect 
the wrath of the inhabitants of Konavli to something else. It 
is, however, more probable that the statement was a part of a 
more general pressure on the opposition, so that the ruling 
party could take the political initiative to the full. 
  Anyway, if we analyze the opening statement of President 
Tudjman at the said session of the HDZ Presidency, the 
inevitable conclusion is that black days are ahead for 
opposition parties, especially for those with large memberships. 
Referring to the necessity for "unified national politics," the 
Croatian president elaborated on the "scenario" for "causing a 
constitutional crisis," and the only argument he presented were 
"written guidelines" from abroad sent to "a party." He did not 
say whether the unmentioned party required those "guidelines" 
itself and implemented them in its political practice, as if 
those "details are not important at all." The fact that Radic, 
on the other hand, came up with several instead of just one 
party is just a consequence of an intellectually well-organized 
political campaign directed against Tudjman's non-party 
opponents, for example against "the six" who demanded his 
resignation last fall, but also against the press and trade 
unions. 
  Tudjman's speech to the 15 "apostles," obviously also 
designed to make them see which of them is the HDZ "Judas," 
shows that the ruling party cannot break free from the 
"conspiracy" syndrome typical of one-party systems. Commonplace 
political fighting, which also consists of contacts with similar 
parties abroad, is thus consciously turned into "undermining the 
foundations of the state," which, as a logical countermeasure, 
could result in introducing some elements of open police and 
court repression. 
  Another proof that this method is worthwhile is what 
happened 
with Paraga's Croatian Rights Party [HSP]. The party's political 
extremism did not encounter resistance when it was beneficial 
for the authorities, when it made it easier for them to gather 
volunteers for the war. But after the political situation had 
settled, the HSP was accused of something that could not 
actually even be proven. HSP leaders were eventually acquitted 
of charges that they attempted to "undermine the constitutional 
system," but the goal of that show has nevertheless been 
realized: Paraga has been totally discredited and the HSP 
marginalized. Moreover, the late Ivan Cesar, who was separately 
working on gathering Croatian Christian Democrats, was ridiculed 
in the famous documentary about Bruno Busic. 
  Something like that now also threatens the Croatian Social 
Liberal Party [HSLS], the only party that can now undermine the 
present political monopoly of the HDZ. Regarding the liberals, 
the problem does not lie in "instructions from abroad" or if the 
president and the secretary general of the ruling party consider 
them "conspirators" at all. Budisa's followers, according to 
Tudjman, jeopardize Croatian interests for more global strategic 
reasons. The key problem, therefore, is the fact that the HSLS 
has assimilated into the typical framework of 
"liberal-democratic" understanding of national question in 
post-communist Europe. According to Tudjman, it was that option 
that was "directed toward preserving Yugoslavia and secretly 
hoped for the defeat of Croatia in 1991, especially this 
Croatia, sovereign and on its own." 
<H5>  Launching Against the HSLS </H5>
  Consequently, the conclusion of the Croatian president is 
even more explicit and unrelenting: "The liberal-civic concept 
is looking for support in the strata of the Croatian psyche, and 
it gets it, not only from those who feel nostalgia for 
Yugoslavia, but also from those preoccupied by those wide 
universalist, cosmopolitan ideas.... It has been trying to 
prevent the HDZ from winning the elections, since it could not 
prevent Tudjman from being elected (at the latest elections), in 
order to be able, through weakening the coalition or by means of 
concessions to each other, to redirect Croatian politics." 
  What is even more interesting, at the session of the HDZ 
Presidency, Tudjman also pointed his political cutting edge 
toward the "Catholic-universalist" concept from which European 
Christian Democracy stems. The Croatian president is convinced 
that international diplomacy today also uses Catholicism to 
thwart authentic Croatian interests. To be more precise, the 
matter at issue is a statement by Pope John Paul II, of 4 
January this year, in which he made a hypothetical reference to 
"the community of southern Slavs." For Tudjman, that was a clear 
sign of a turning point in the official politics of the Vatican, 
especially as some 10 days later, the Pope condemned "extreme 
nationalism": "Therefore, from the viewpoint of world 
Christianity and from the viewpoint of Catholicism, the Croats 
are entrusted with again being a bridge toward the Orthodox 
creed for uniting Christianity. To that effect it was announced 
that, if there is peace and should the Holy Father accept the 
invitation and visit Croatia, in addition to Zagreb, he would 
visit both Sarajevo and Belgrade." 
  Finding a global "conspiracy" in intertwining liberal-civic 
and Catholic-universalist options, and considering the past 
repugnance to social-democratic views on the Croatian reality on 
the international scene, Tudjman is becoming more and more 
lonely, which may have negative repercussions for settling 
conflicts on the territory of former Yugoslavia. In public, the 
responsibility for that will, of course, be redirected to the 
"subversive" activities of some opposition parties, primarily 
those that openly oppose Croatian politics in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. If that should not prove successful enough, 
then the possibility that "some party members who are not 
willing to enforce the state politics may leave," as Jure Radic 
announced directly in Cavtat. Tudjman, as we know, does not 
advocate "disturbing the balance" in the party. It is still 
safer to shift the burden of blame for present and future 
failures of Croatian politics onto his opponents. 
  The opposition, on the other hand, is still not capable of 
using the weaknesses of the ruling party to its advantage, 
although Tudjman's followers have probably reached their 
all-time low in their five-year history. Before the press, 
Drazen Budisa openly admits that the popularity of his party 
"has fallen in relation to the post-election period," and he is 
also aware of the negative effects "of a fierce media campaign" 
that is systematically directed against the liberals. Stipac's 
Croatian Peasant's Party, as the only party that is gradually 
ramifying the network of its branches, has actually never dealt 
with "high politics," except for the personal frustrations of 
its president regarding the events in central Bosnia. Savka's 
Croatian National Party, which the ruling party ironically 
refers to as "nationalists without people," cannot get over the 
debacle that happened a year and a half ago. 
  The Left keep talking about their unification and it will 
never come, so that only Racan's social democrats are present in 
the public, mostly regarding social questions. The Right is even 
more disoriented, so that a possible unification would not make 
them a major political party. 
  Dalmatian regionalists contracted Paraga's "disease," and 
they have to prove their innocence in court, while the Istrian 
Democratic Congress is becoming more and more like an "Istrian 
HDZ," regarding the fact that there is a strong conflict of 
political factions in the party. And finally, Serbian parties 
and forums are not a real opposition either, but only serve as 
"test balloons" of official Croatian politics. 
<H5>  Why Is Tudjman Concerned? </H5>
  Bearing in mind those realities regarding the opposition, it 
becomes even more vague why Tudjman is so concerned about rumors 
about "overthrowing the legal Croatian authorities." If that is 
just political "scenography" for unpopular moves on the domestic 
and international scene, especially regarding the peace accord 
between Zagreb and Belgrade, then this game makes some sense. 
If, on the other hand, the political public is being forcefully 
"disciplined," Croatia will soon have to deal with more trouble.

  [Text] As we have learned, Radovan Karadzic, president of 
the Srpska republic, met with Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic in Belgrade today. After the talks, correspondents of 
foreign television stations overwhelmed President Karadzic with 
questions about threats of air strikes. Let us hear how Dr. 
Karadzic answered: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Please 
comment on the statement by French Foreign Minister Juppe that 
he will demand an ultimatum for the Serbs, 10 days to withdraw 
20 [words indistinct]. 
  [Karadzic] Minister Juppe should ask [Austrian Foreign] 
Minister Mock about the fate of the Austrian ultimatum in 1914. 
  [Unidentified correspondent, in English fading into 
Serbo-Croatian translation] Will you withdraw your artillery 
from the positions around Sarajevo? 
  [Karadzic, in English fading into Serbo-Croatian 
translation] 
Immediately, as soon as we sign the peace plan. 
  [Unidentified correspondent, in English fading into 
Serbo-Croatian translation] The NATO secretary general today 
said that it was high time to do something in Bosnia. How would 
you comment on this? 
  [Karadzic, in English fading into Serbo-Croatian 
translation] 
Well, had they taken no actions in the former Yugoslavia, it 
would not have disintegrated. I would love it if they would not 
meddle into our affairs at all, because, it is precisely they 
who have caused this war. 
  [Unidentified correspondent, in English fading into 
Serbo-Croatian translation] What will happen if the NATO 
Council issues an ultimatum to the Serbs to withdraw from their 
positions around Sarajevo? 
  [Karadzic, in English fading into Serbo-Croatian 
translation] 
How can we withdraw from Sarajevo? Sarajevo is not a 
surrounded town, but a divided town. We hold half of the town. 
If somebody is asking us to give up our own town, then no, 
never, out of the question. 
  [Unidentified correspondent, in English fading into 
Serbo-Croatian translation] Do you believe in air strikes, Mr. 
Karadzic? 
  [Karadzic, in English fading into Serbo-Croatian 
translation] 
I believe in God. [end recording]

  [Text] The statement made by President Mircea Snegur at 
the congress "Our Home, the Republic of Moldova" on 5 February 
in fact reveals the fact that the people of the Republic of 
Moldova have everything in common with Romania, such as history, 
culture, aspirations for a democratic life and for freedom, and 
a need for peace and security, said the spokesman of the 
Romanian Presidency, Ambassador Traian Chebeleu in an interview 
he granted to our radio station today. 
  According to Mr. Traian Chebeleu, the statement by President 
Mircea Snegur shows in fact how strong is the pressure put on 
the Republic of Moldova by the nostalgic-imperial forces; 
another important factor is the electoral campaign, which is 
marked by the offensive of the pro-Russian forces that wish to 
achieve the closest possible bondage of the Republic of Moldova 
with the CIS, also through treaties. 
  In his interview, Mr. Chebeleu also mentioned that the 
actions in our county that call on Romania to take firm steps to 
recuperate those territories that were severed in June 1940 and 
the unrealistic slogans regarding the unification of the 
Romanian territories have, in fact, assisted the forces that are 
seeking to pull the Republic of Moldova away from Romania. 
  Thus, I believe that one should not dramatize the emphasis 
placed on the idea of the Moldovan nation or on non-unification 
with Romania, obviously due to the circumstance of the electoral 
campaign, because these are theories that remind us of 
well-known Bolshevik concepts, said Mr. Traian Chebeleu. 
  He also mentioned that Romania is the strongest supporter of 
the Republic of Moldova in the international community and that 
the policy that our country has promoted and continues to 
promote is to consolidate the independence of the Republic of 
Moldova and to constantly take concrete actions to gradually 
bring the two states closer to each other. 
  Asked whether the future opinion poll that will take place 
in 
the Republic of Moldova on the issue of its independence will 
not sanction the concept of complete separation from Romania, 
Mr. Traian Chebeleu said that this might also play a positive 
role if the independence of the Republic of Moldova is more and 
more frequently questioned by political forces in the Russian 
Federation, whose representative is the nationalist extremist 
Zhirinovskiy. One can also expect that the poll will confirm 
people's option to consolidate their independence in a way 
similar to that practiced in the Baltic republics.

<F P=106> [Report by E.Cz., E.K., and Ma.S.: "PSL-SLD Negotiations; </F>
Evening Compromise"] 
  [Text] The leaders of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] 
and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] reached a compromise 
yesterday a few minutes before 2300; by doing so, they put an 
and to the crisis which started 11 days ago. 
  In line with the joint communique, both parties want to 
maintain the coalition until the elections in four years' time. 
The coalition members agreed to unanimously support the budget 
bill submitted by the government. They expressed very positive 
opinions on the "knowledge, competence, and activeness of Marek 
Borowski." The coalition agreement, as both sides unanimously 
stress, is still binding. Therefore, the candidate for the 
vacant post of the finance minister will be proposed by SLD. 
Borowski already knows his name, but, as he said, he cannot 
reveal it yet. 
<H5>  Hours Before </H5>
  On Tuesday [8 February] Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak 
irrevocably accepted the resignation of Marek Borowski, deputy 
prime minister and finance minister. The president signed the 
prime minister's motion concerning his recall. The coalition 
talks, which started in the evening in the hotel of the Office 
of the Council of Ministers [URM] at Parkowa Street, were 
preceded by an hour-long meeting between Kwasniewski and Pawlak, 
which had not been the first one in the past two days. The 
prime minister's Press Secretary Ewa Wachowicz told the 
journalists, who had come to the URM seat in quite a large 
number, that there would be no comments either before or 
immediately after the meeting. 
  The Council of Ministers, which held a session on that day, 
despite earlier declarations, did not issue its opinions on the 
Sejm committees' amendments to the budget bill (they were 
presented by Minister Borowski, who had already handed in his 
resignation). The government members met later in the 
Constitutional composition (only the prime minister and 
ministers) in order to discuss the situation that had developed 
after Marek Borowski's resignation. As we learned from one of 
the participants of this sitting, the meeting was held so that 
ministers would not find out about the events concerning the 
government from the mass media. 
<H5>  The Left Miscalculated </H5>
  "The decision concerning the recall of Minister Marek 
Borowski was not made because I wanted this -- it was made 
because of the declaration of the interested parties," said 
Prime Minister Pawlak in Radio "Zet." The prime minister 
believes that Borowski's decision to submit his resignation was 
unnecessary. 
  The response of SLD politicians to the prime minister's 
decision, or rather, its lack, suggests that they were taken 
aback by it. 
  According to PSL members, Aleksander Kwasniewski and his 
cooperators made a second attempt to force PSL to make a 
decision that is favorable. They claim that the first attempt 
was when the composition of the cabinet was being negotiated. 
They say that the first list submitted in the Belvedere was 
fully agreed with SLD. SLD queried it and renegotiated the 
filling of the posts in the key economic ministries, which, 
according to the peasants, was a deliberate propaganda ploy of 
SLD. Pawlak, who was obliged to meet the deadlines set by the 
Constitution, had to agree to these SLD proposals. In PSL 
circles one can hear opinions that the issue of Borowski was a 
similar ploy. 
  According to unofficial information, which was confirmed by 
several credible sources, Deputy Prime Minister Borowski knew 
earlier about the scheduled recall of his deputy; he consented 
to it, but kept delaying the decision to sign off on it. Thus, 
it was Pawlak who did it. The violent response of SLD was 
received by PSL as another propaganda trick, which was once 
again supposed to help SLD gain greater influence in the 
government as well as to limit the role of Prime Minister Pawlak 
and Minister Strak: Such a version of the developments seems to 
be borne out by unofficial statements of SLD politicians, who 
claim that Marek Borowski's resignation was a tactical ploy. It 
was supposed to force PSL to hold talks on the functioning of 
the government, economic policy, cadre policy, information 
policy, and the cooperation within the coalition -- that is, all 
the controversial issues. SLD accuses the prime minister of 
steering the work of the government rather inefficiently; it 
also points out that Minister Strak, when making decisions 
concerning the cadres in the state administration, favors his 
party colleagues. 
  Prime Minister Pawlak, backed by his party, did not yield in 
this conflict. The peasants emphasize that they would not allow 
anyone to place them in a second position, just as it was in the 
time of the Polish People's Republic. For the time being SLD 
lost, or rather, it was outmaneuvered. Will it receive anything 
in return for Borowski's recall? There were speculations that 
it would be the recall of Michal Strak. According to credible 
sources, the prime minister did not agree to that. 
<H5>  What Does the SLD Want? </H5>
  When the conflict between the prime minister and Minister 
Borowski came to the surface, SLD politicians started to say 
increasingly louder that the government head should sign as soon 
as possible appointments of the coalition's representatives in 
the presidential ministries, that is, in the Ministry of 
National Defense, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. SLD politicians unofficially 
confirm that they want to force Pawlak to make such a decision. 
It would be a bargaining chip for Kwasniewski's party over the 
"issue of Kawalec." 
  Despite the efforts of SLD leaders, the prime minister has 
so 
far been unable to make a decision on "strengthening the 
coalition" in the presidential ministries. 
  SLD also wants a stronger position of the Presidium of the 
Government. It consists of the prime minister and the deputy 
prime ministers. It is an extra-constitutional body. In line 
with the SLD proposal, it would be the presidium, not only the 
prime minister, that would steer the work of the cabinet. 
  To their surprise, journalists were admitted to the URM 
premises, where, in line with earlier official information, the 
coalition talks were supposed to be held. Fifteen minutes after 
the announced time when the talks were supposed to begin, the 
journalists were addressed by Ewa Wachowicz, who said that the 
talks had already begun, but she was not authorized to tell them 
where the meeting was being held. When asked bluntly whether 
the talks were being held at Parkowa Street, she replied: 
  "I do not confirm this, but I do not deny it, either." 
  Therefore, most of the journalists went to the hotel at 
Parkowa Street. Twenty minutes later, those few who decided to 
stay in URM saw the prime minister with two bodyguards walk 
toward his office. 
  "We have only just started," he told the surprised 
journalists. The actual coalition talks began at Parkowa Street 
at approximately 2000 [1900 GMT].

  [Excerpts] Pale, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Feb 10 (AFP) -- 
Bosnia's Serbs on Thursday rejected NATO's ultimatum to end 
their siege of Sarajevo and said their heavy weapons would not 
be removed from around the city. [passage omitted] 
  "NATO is since last night an international terrorist 
organisation and we will consider it as such until it changes 
its stance with regard to us," spokesman Miroslav Toholj told 
AFP. "From the first air strikes, war will spread throughout 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and degenerate into World War III," he added, 
threatening to use weapons "never before used by the Serbs." 
  "We won't manage to shoot down 20 planes, but five, yes. 
That will be enough for people to understand that the others 
are not safe," he added. 
  Meanwhile the UN High Commissioner for Refugees' 
representation in Sarajevo said Thursday that it had recalled to 
Zagreb or Belgrade two thirds of its staff stationed in 
Serb-held areas of Bosnia. UNHCR spokesman Kris Janowski said 
the move involved 10 of the 16 or so UNHCR employees stationed 
in Pale, near Sarajevo, and in the northwestern region of Banja 
Luka. 
  Janowski would not confirm earlier reports that the recall 
was part of an order to withdraw all UNHCR employees from the 
field or that some of these employees were being prevented from 
leaving by the Serbs. "We are having problems at the 
checkpoints but they are not hostages," he said. 
  In Belgrade, the new Serbian parliament Thursday put the 
ultimatum issued by the 16 nations in the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organisation (NATO) on the agenda for its constituent session. 
  The proposal to discuss Wednesday's ultimatum came from 
ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical Party deputy Tomislav Nikolic, 
who proposed to write to all countries with which the rump 
Yugoslavia maintains diplomatic ties "that ultimatums do not 
settle wars."

<F P=106> [Report from Geneva by Tihomir Vinkovic] </F>
  [Excerpt] Following their meetings in Geneva on 9 and 10 
February held in an open and constructive atmosphere, Mate 
Granic, vice president and minister for foreign affairs of the 
Republic of Croatia, and Haris Silajdzic, president of the 
government of Bosnia-Herzegovina, have agreed on the following 
joint statement, which we present in its entirety: 
  1. Both countries will send letters to the UN Security 
Council demanding international controls over 
Bosnia-Herzegovina's borders to achieve a peaceful solution. 
  2. The two sides have agreed that the commanders of the 
Croatian Defense Council [HVO] and the Bosnia-Herzegovina army, 
Generals Ante Roso and Rasim Delic, should meet within the next 
seven days to outline in conrete terms an agreement on a total 
cease-fire between the Bosnia-Herzegovina army and the HVO in 
all battlefields as the first step to the solution of all issues 
in the interest of the Croatian and Muslim peoples. 
  3. Both sides will speed up negotiations on an unconditional 
exchange of all prisoners, particularly the Mostar group, and 
cooperate in the search for missing persons. 
  4. Both sides agreed to continue their talks on all models 
of 
future Muslim-Croatian relations in Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
future relations between the two countries and to respect the 
agreements already finalized. 
  5. Agreement has been reached that, regardless of any future 
solutions, the return of all refugees should be secured 
following the restoration of peace. 
  6. Agreement has been reached that the talks should continue 
and intensify. 
  Geneva, 10 February 1994. 
  This joint statement was signed by Haris Silajdzic, General 
Ante Roso, and Mate Granic. The joint statement is a step 
toward the solution of Muslim-Croatian relations as well as of 
relations between the Republic of Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mate Granic said following the signing of 
the joint statement. He maintains that the signed statement and 
the letters sent by ambassadors of the Republic of Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to the United Nations in New York are a basis 
for appropriate action by the UN Security Council. 
  The plenary session began at 1800 in Geneva's Palace of 
Nations where peace mediators Owen and Stoltenberg are talking 
to the representatives of the three peoples of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is hard to say how long this session 
will last because of the irreconcilable standpoints of the Serbs 
and Muslims regarding the makeup of a commission which should 
investigate the circumstances surrounding Saturday's massacre in 
Sarajevo's marketplace. The Serbs insist on their own 
representative taking part in the commission's work, something 
that is being met with resolute disapproval from Muslims.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Minister Granic [Croatian deputy 
prime minister and foreign minister], [Bosnian Muslim] Prime 
Minister Silajdzic, and General Roso [Bosnian Croat Army chief 
of the General Staff] have signed a joint statement in Geneva. 
Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina will send letters to the UN 
Security Council demanding international supervision of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina's borders with the aim of finding a peaceful 
solution. The two sides have agreed that the commanders of the 
Croatian Defense Council [HVO] and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, 
Ante Roso and Rasim Delic respectively, will meet over the next 
seven days to implement the agreement on an absolute cease-fire 
between the HVO and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army on all fronts as 
the first step in resolving all issues of interest to the Croat 
and Muslim peoples. 
  [Begin recording] [Granic] We are deeply aware of the 
gravity 
of the problem, especially in the field. Therein lies the great 
importance of these meetings, because we discussed matters 
openly and reviewed all burning issues. As you can see, utmost 
priority has been given to ending all conflicts and exchanging 
prisoners as soon as possible. However, we also discussed all 
fundamental issues pertaining to overall Bosniak Muslim-Croat 
relations and the agreements reached so far. We will go on 
talking and we believe that we will be meeting again in the near 
future. [end recording] [passage omitted] 
  [Begin recording] [Silajdzic] First, I must say that we held 
talks in a constructive atmosphere, in an encouraging 
atmosphere, if I can put it that way, about very difficult and 
complex issues. It is not that simple to find a solution. I 
think that the beginning was good. We agreed, among other 
things, to organize a meeting between military commanders within 
the next seven days to discuss a permanent cease-fire. We 
agreed that one of the main principles is the return to their 
homes of all refugees -- whenever it is possible to control this 
-- to talk seriously and to resume talks about the exchange of 
prisoners and of the Mostar group in particular. We also agreed 
to continue talks at all levels. [end recording] [passage 
omitted] 
  [Begin recording] [Mile Akmadzic, minister for 
interrepublic cooperation of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, 
identified by caption] Under the auspices of cochairmen Lord 
Owen and Mr. Stoltenberg, we talked about the possibility of 
exchanging prisoners, restoring the energy-generating system in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and about humanitarian aid. However, the 
focus of today's talks was the massacre in Sarajevo and the ways 
of establishing who was responsible for it. [end recording] 
  [Correspondent] The Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna 
delegation 
in the talks with the Muslims consisted of Ministers Akmadzic 
and Zubak and General Roso. After the agreement reached last 
night about relations that are to be based on a union of three 
republics and about the possibility of setting up counties, 
provinces, regions, and cantons on an ethnic principle within 
the republics and with a degree of autonomy, the Muslims are 
again asking for something quite the opposite. They came up 
with a proposal that failed to mention the republics in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and this is unacceptable to the Croats. 
  Observers here think that the map by Komsic [Croat member of 
Bosnian Muslim delegation and member of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Presidency] is, among other things, a maneuver to gain time. The 
Muslims have put forward a proposal similar to the Vance-Owen 
plan under which the cantons or provinces -- whatever you want 
to call them -- can be formed on an ethnic principle. 
  Some parts of the Komsic-Muslim proposal are unacceptable to 
the Croats and some parts are unrealistic, sources close to the 
delegation of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna said. 
  Croats and others studied the proposed map of the cantons 
and 
reacted by saying that it had come too late. Among themselves 
the republics should talk about protecting national minorities. 
The best way of providing protection would be through cantons 
and counties within autonomous units. Any decision by the Serbs 
to leave the union would change the situation and more precise 
solutions would then be needed. 
  Both the convention in Livno and the state of Croatia itself 
support the EU plan, which was also endorsed by President 
Clinton. President Clinton's envoy Redman and diplomat Tarnoff 
are expected with interest here in Geneva. 
  The [Croat-Muslim] statement is of enormous importance at 
this time of pressure from the international community and on 
the eve of tomorrow's UN Security Council session on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. It will help to create a climate more 
conducive to defusing the tension between Croats and Muslims.

<F P=106> [Statements by French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and </F>
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman following their talks in 
Geneva on 10 February -- recorded; Juppe speaks in French with 
passage-by-passage translation into Serbo-Croatian; translated 
from the French] 
  [Excerpts] The meeting between Tudjman and Juppe finished 
about an hour ago in Zagreb. We have just received the 
declarations made by President Tudjman and the French foreign 
minister. [passage omitted] 
  [Juppe] Ladies and gentlemen, given the time, I shall be 
brief. I would like first of all to thank President Tudjman for 
having received me at such short notice, as I only decided to 
make this trip yesterday. My delegation and I are grateful for 
the welcome we have received. 
  I came to tell President Tudjman to what extent the gravity 
of the situation was of concern to France. As you know, France, 
with its American and European allies, initiated the decision 
taken yesterday by the North Atlantic Council, demanding the 
lifting of the siege of Sarajevo and the placement of the heavy 
weaponry under the control of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]. 
If these demands are not met within 10 days, the decision makes 
provision for the use of force. We are totally determined to 
implement this decision. In the 10 days before the expiry of 
the ultimatum we would like to remind everyone that a 
European-sponsored peace plan remains on the table. This 
proposal, I repeat, is still valid. It can, I may add, be 
adapted in the course of negotiations, and I call on all parties 
concerned to allow reason to prevail in order to prevent an 
escalation. I hope that Croatia can join in this search for a 
peaceful solution. 
  [Tudjman] For my part, I told Mr. Juppe that Croatia 
welcomes 
the current EU [European Union] and NATO decisions, adopted with 
the approval of the EU and the United States, to undertake 
resolute steps not only to bring the suffering of Sarajevo to an 
end but also to exert pressure on all sides to achieve peace. 
Croatia has also welcomed and done everything to implement the 
Juppe-Kinkel plan of action, which later became the EU plan. 
Croatia welcomes the new plan and will do everything it can to 
prevent further bloodshed and, as Mr. Juppe said, get all sides 
to accept the peace plan, which can also be modified, to end the 
war and provide conditions for stability and the establishment 
of the new international order in this part of Europe. We 
highly appreciate the efforts of the French Government as well 
as this act by Minister Juppe, who came to the dark Balkans at 
this late hour.

<F P=106> [Interview with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by </F>
Franz-Olivier Giesbert in Zagreb on 11 February -- live or 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Giesbert] Good day, Alain Juppe. Everyone is 
agreed that you are the man who has made it possible for the 
West to recover its honor by issuing an ultimatum to the Bosnian 
Serbs. After GATT this is a new success for you, and for French 
diplomacy, but now it is you whom people are going to associate 
with the first risks and perhaps the first deaths. You arrived 
in Zagreb yesterday evening. Does what you have already heard 
make you optimistic or not? 
  [Juppe] I will be wary of being optimistic. I have come here 
to present France's position, as defined by the president, the 
prime minister, and all of the ministers with authority in this 
matter. I had a twofold objective: The first is to convince my 
interlocutors of the seriousness of the situation and of the 
Atlantic alliance's determination to ensure that this ultimatum 
is enforced, and my second objective is to give a reminder that 
there are peace proposals, a plan, a plan of the European Union, 
on the table in Geneva, which may evolve. I believe moreover 
that our American friends are in the process of giving thought 
to this and working on it. It is a plan which contains the only 
possible solution, because there is no military solution to this 
conflict, of course. 
  [Giesbert] Something that may appear strange is that one 
only 
hears from you in connection with this matter. Are you sure of 
the complete and total support of Edouard Balladur and Francois 
Mitterrand ? 
  [Juppe] I am certain of it. 
  [Giesbert] You are hardly going to tell me otherwise. 
  [Juppe] That is because, quite simply, it is the truth. 
  [Giesbert] But the Serbs do not look as though they have 
decided to comply. Have you seen what Radovan Karadzic, the 
leader of the Bosnian Serbs, has said, for example: Let Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe ask Austrian Foreign Minister Mock what 
happened to Austria in 1914, when it issued an ultimatum to the 
Serbs. This is a way of reminding us that the last Serbian 
ultimatum ended in a world war. 
  [Juppe] Yes, you know, Franz-Olivier Giesbert.... 
  [Giesbert, interrupting] This is a terrible threat. 
  [Juppe] I am not going to launch myself into a controversy, 
and I believe one has to keep one's head in this matter. I will 
tell you that the delegation of Bosnian Serbs is still present 
in Geneva. So, on the one hand we have the hot air and on the 
other, I believe, an awareness of the danger. Moreover, the 
fact that these talks are continuing is the best demonstration 
of this. 
  Let me remind you that yesterday, or the day before 
yesterday, the Bosnian Serbs apparently signed an agreement in 
which they pledged to withdraw their heavy weapons, so let us 
not go to extremes right away. The ultimatum exists, we are 
determined to implement it, the Atlantic alliance will honor the 
commitments it has made, and in the next 10 days ahead of us let 
us step up the calls for greater reason and wisdom. 
  [Giesbert] Yesterday, however, Radovan Karadzic also said: 
We 
will not withdraw from Sarajevo because the town is not under 
siege; it is divided in two. 
  [Juppe] We did not ask for this. One has to have a look at 
what the proposals or the demands of the Atlantic alliance are, 
and those which feature in the peace plan, and as everyone very 
well knows, we have not demanded the withdrawal of the Serbs; we 
demanded the withdrawal of the artillery batteries which are 
carrying out the shelling which you are aware of, with the 
massacres which you are aware of. This is what features in the 
alliance's ultimatum, and this is not at all a demand for the 
Serbs of Sarajevo -- who, it is true, have been there for 
centuries -- to leave. In the European Union's plan, what is 
anticipated is UN administration of Sarajevo for the very 
purpose of guaranteeing the coexistence of all the communities, 
and finally to determine the status of this town. So, let us 
not mix everything up, and let us not distort the positions of 
the international community. 
  [Giesbert] Nevertheless the temperature has been rising. You 
were not able to see Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the Russian 
nationalist leader, on television yesterday evening, because you 
were aboard the plane for Zagreb, but he threatened us, France, 
the French people, with terrible reprisals. 
  [Juppe] Two or three weeks ago Mr. Zhirinovskiy also 
threatened Germany, I believe, with a world war. He sketched 
out a map of Europe which eliminates several countries which 
currently exist, so this does not have much to do with the 
alliance's decision. I have said what I thought about Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy's attitude, and if you want to make me say that we 
should be watchful with regard to the situation in Europe, well, 
I am already convinced of that. 
  [Giesbert] There is of course the problem of Russia, which 
denies NATO's right to decide on air strikes. 
  [Juppe] The latest Russian statements are not encouraging at 
all. Having said that, I do not believe that Russia has the 
capacity to paralyze the system at the United Nations, not even 
at the Security Council. Moreover, we shall be endeavoring to 
convince Russia that it too must join the search for a peace 
plan. We have been urging them to do so for quite a long time, 
the United States has joined our efforts, and, as far as I am 
concerned, I shall seek to speak to Mr. Kozyrev in the same 
language. 
  [Giesbert] In Sarajevo, your destination, there was a fresh 
outbreak of shooting last night. There is a danger of new 
provocations. 
  [Juppe] Yes, that is why the ultimatum is more necessary 
than 
ever. A cease-fire having been signed 48 hours ago, we note 
that once again this cease-fire has amounted to nothing but 
words on paper. We shall therefore achieve tangible results 
only if the heavy weapons are drawn back or are placed under UN 
responsibility. This has, I think, provided further proof that 
we cannot stay as we are at present. 
  [Giesbert] Let us consider the possibility of having to 
envisage the worst possile scenario. The military are very 
skeptical. You have no doubt read what they are saying. There 
are 300 to 400 Serb artillery pieces deployed around Sarajevo, 
they are very mobile, they can be moved very quickly, the ground 
is mountainous and thickly wooded. Should it prove necessary, 
do you really believe that the Serb guns could be destroyed? 
That is the big question. 
  [Juppe] Yes, of course, that is the big question. But I 
would like to make it very clear to you, Mr. Giesbert, that in 
this affair there is no question of having the diplomats ranged 
on one side and the soldiers on the other. In such a grave 
situation, we are not so irresponsible as to fail to coordinate 
our efforts very closely. The decision, I repeat, was taken in 
close liaison between the defense and foreign ministries and 
there were consultations with UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces], 
General Cot, General Rose, and also with the NATO military. 
Besides, all of this had been under consideration for months, 
since it was last July that NATO drew up the necessary plans. 
It is true that we are in a grave situation. This is why every 
effort must be made to bring the warring parties to their 
senses. But we have not got into this situation lightly, 
without having pondered matters at length. 
  [Giesbert] Alain Juppe, you are now leaving for Sarajevo. 
Will you be meeting the Bosnian Serbs? 
  [Juppe] No, the Bosnian Serbs are in Geneva. I was willing 
to meet.... 
  [Giesbert, interrupting] There are some in Sarajevo. 
  [Juppe] I was willing to meet them, I was even prepared to 
go 
to Belgrade if it served a useful purpose. But I have decided 
that the virulence of their first reactions failed to create the 
necessary conditions. If matters evolve, the message which I 
have brought here with me must be addressed to everyone, and is 
as follows: Take note, the ultimatum risks creating -- has now 
created -- new circumstances. We are determined to enforce it, 
so let us go back to the negotiating table. 
  [Giesbert] As far as the Bosnian Serbs are concerned, you 
are public enemy number one. Are you not afraid that all this 
hostility might be focused on France? 
  [Juppe] Let us not disguise things. Above all, having asked, 
if not demanded, for a burst of dignity from the international 
community and from France in particular, I would not wish 
everyone to scatter in all directions just because we are faced 
with a difficult situation. 
  [Giesbert] There is a lot of talk of war, but you believe in 
peace. 
  [Juppe] There is no other solution, and as far as I am 
concerned I shall tirelessly do my utmost to see that this plan 
-- over which at present the differences are of the order of 0.5 
to 1 percent, 2 percent maximum -- is brought to the table 
again. We are not going to get into a big argument just over 
one or two cities, since we are here to deal with it. 
  [Giesbert] Alain Juppe, have a good day, and courage. 
  [Juppe] Thank you.

  [Text] United Nations, Feb 11 (AFP) -- UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali has authorized his representative in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to approve the use of air strikes to defend 
UN personnel anywhere in the former Yugoslav republic. 
  The representative, Yasushi Akashi, already had the 
authority 
to call in air support to help operations aimed at reopening the 
airport at Tuzla and for rotating UN personnel in and out of the 
besieged areas of Srebenica and Zepa. 
  Butrus-Ghali's authorization was notified Friday [11 
February] in a letter to the UN Security Council and which was 
obtained by AFP.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic by </F>
unidentified correspondents in Geneva on 10 February -- 
recorded; Karadzic and correspondents speak in English with 
superimposed Serbo-Croat translation] 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Karadzic, do you plan to withdraw the 
Serbian troops as is stipulated in the agreement on the 
cease-fire brokered yesterday? 
  [Karadzic] The cease-fire was agreed upon a week ago and is 
not connected to NATO threats or the ultimatum. I believe that 
NATO is knocking at an open door and is flexing its muscles 
absolutely needlessly. Our commanders have drawn up some kind 
of agreement on a permanent cease-fire around Sarajevo. I have 
spoken to Mr. Akashi about this issue, and I prepared all this. 
This has nothing to do with NATO. 
  [Correspondent] You will maintain the cease-fire? 
  [Karadzic] Yes. It has been brokered by the representatives 
of the [warring] sides and Mr. Akashi. NATO has nothing to do 
with us. 
  [Correspondent] Neither the Croats, the Muslims, nor the 
cochairmen want a joint commission to investigate the [5 
February] Sarajevo event. Will you go on demanding it? 
  [Karadzic] We have encouraging information that a commission 
will be formed and that a Serbian expert will be part of it.

  [Text] Geneva, Feb 12 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb leader Radovan 
Karadzic confirmed in Geneva Saturday [12 February] that his 
forces would withdraw their heavy artillery from Sarajevo, but 
he also that said Moslem infantry must be controlled. NATO has 
issued an ultimatum for all heavy weapons to be withdrawn from 
Serb-besieged Sarajevo by February 21 or its warplanes will 
destroy the guns. The NATO demand issued last Wednesday does 
not include infantry or light weapons. 
  Karadzic said the Serb agreement to withdraw its heavy 
artillery was not in respect of the NATO ultimatum but according 
to a previous agreement reached with the UN envoy for Yugoslavia 
Yasushi Akashi. "On 5th of February I agreed with Mr. Akashi a 
settlement for long-lasting ceasefire in Sarajevo and this 
agreement envisaged on-site control of heavy weaponry of both 
sides Serbian and Moslem," Karadzic said. 
  "We are not members of NATO. We do not live with NATO. We 
have agreed this ceasefire with Moslems brokered by Mr. Akashi 
and this agreement envisaged control of Moslem infantry," 
Karadzic said.

  [Text] Geneva, Feb 11 (AFP) -- Bosnia's Moslem-led 
government refused to discuss the demilitarization of Sarajevo 
until besieging Serb artillery is withdrawn from around the 
capital on the second day of peace talks here Friday. 
  "The Moslem side would prefer to leave that 
(demilitarization) until after the exclusion zone is negotiated 
and up and running," EC negotiator Lord Owen, a co-chairman of 
the talks, told reporters. 
  Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic of the mainly Moslem Bosnian 
government told AFP Friday: "We refuse to discuss Sarajevo 
without the rest of Bosnia. We want to discuss the overall 
settlement now." An aide was carrying maps of Bosnia for the 
discussion. 
  Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic entered the second day 
of talks here in a decidedly more upbeat mood than on Thursday, 
when he refused to participate if Serbs did not join an 
investigation into last week's mortar massacre in Sarajevo that 
killed 68. A compromise was reached Thursday for the setting up 
of a committee with Serb and Bosnian government liaisons 
involved, to investigate the massacre, which led to the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organisation issuing an ultimatum Wednesday for 
Serb artillery to withdraw from around Sarajevo. The liaison 
formula was clearly the key to the compromise, worked out by UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. 
  Bosnian Croats, the third of the former Yugoslav state's 
warring factions, were represented at the talks by Mile 
Akhmadzic.

<F P=106> [By Michael Adler] </F>
  [Text] Geneva, Feb 12 (AFP) -- The latest round of Geneva 
peace talks on Bosnia ended Saturday [12 February] without any 
progress and will resume at the end of February or early March, 
UN mediator Thorvald Stoltenberg said. 
  He said the Yugoslav conference was adjourning longer than 
usual to give time for changes in light of a February 21 NATO 
deadline for air strikes in Sarajevo if Serb heavy weapons are 
not withdrawn and diplomatic pushes by both Washington and 
Moscow. 
  Serbs, Moslems and Croats have waged a three-way war in 
Bosnia since April 1992. The EC-UN Geneva peace conference 
began in September 1992. 
  The three days of talks here failed to advance the plan of 
EC 
mediator Lord Owen and Stoltenberg for a loose union of three 
ethnic mini-states in Bosnia, Stoltenberg told reporters. The 
talks were marked by the United States putting its weight behind 
the diplomatic process and saying they would defend the 
Bosnian's right to a fair settlement. 
  U.S. special envoy Charles Redman said Friday his aim was 
"to 
do what (Clinton) has said we're going to try to do which is to 
try to help the Bosnian Government in these negotiations to come 
to an acceptable solution." 
  The key issue of whether Serbs and Croats will give up land 
the Moslems demand for their state, which is to be made up of 
one-third of Bosnia, was the main sticking point here, 
Stoltenberg said. "We did not suceed to resolve the issue of 
the disputed territories," Stoltenberg told reporters. 
  He explained the long adjournement by saying that "both the 
United States and Russia will in the days to come have a high 
activity with the parties to see if they can influence the 
negotiating process." 
  Owen had earlier Saturday said the Moslems did not want to 
talk about Sarajevo "until they see what happens. Probably the 
NATO deadline has to pass." 
  Owen said the increased U.S. role here, matching the 
military 
one signalled by NATO's gearing up for possible air strikes if 
the artillery is not withdrawn, would require re-calculations by 
all the factions. 
  Washington will "consult very widely and that will take a 
little time and certainly the Bosnian Government is not going to 
shift its position until they get that and also probably until 
they see what is happening in Sarajevo and whether or not there 
are air strikes. 
  "So I think there's an inevitable pause," he said. 
  Owen said the focus was now on talks under the UN Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) in Sarajevo. "There's a tremendous amount of 
negotiating load being put on (UNPROFOR Bosnian commmander) 
General (Michael) Rose and his commanders down in Sarajevo." 
  Asked about the possibility of the Moslems using an eventual 
NATO intervention as a cover for an infantry advance of their 
own, Owen said: "There is an imbalance of forces in Sarajevo 
with the Bosnian Serb forces having a overwhelming preponderance 
of heavy weapons and the Bosnian Moslem army having a massed 
preponderance of infantry in Sarajevo. 
  "This is potentially destabilizing unless it is met by 
confidence-building measures and deloyment of UN forces on the 
ground," Owen said. He pointed out that Sarajevo would not be 
totally demilitarized if the artillery withdrawal succeeds since 
soldiers would remain "and what is going to be done, is the UN 
is interposing itself between the forces, which is brave and 
necessary decision to take."

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Geneva, February 12 (TANJUG) -- President of the 
Serb republic Radovan Karadzic said in Geneva on Saturday that 
the Moslem side at the talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina was not 
acting in good faith but was trying to gain time and provoke a 
foreign military intervention. This is the very reason why any 
interference by NATO, which sent an ultimatum to Bosnian Serbs, 
would be completely wrong, Karadzic said ahead of his talks with 
the Bosnian Croat delegation which began this morning. 
  "I have seen on television that the Serb artillery is being 
withdrawn from around Sarajevo and I hope that this is true," 
Croat delegation head Mile Akmadzic said prior to the talks, 
underscoring that "this will indeed be a step towards peace if 
the artillery is removed." 
  No significant progress was made at the talks between the 
warring sides during the previous two days. The essential 
question--the future organization of Bosnia and its territorial 
division--cannot be resolved by the negotiators at this time, 
since Moslems rejected the concept of a union of three 
republics, proposing instead a model of 17 cantons within a 
single state of Bosnia. 
  The Moslem side also refused to discuss a separate agreement 
on the demilitarization of Sarajevo and the placing of this city 
under a two-year U.N. administration, which was proposed by the 
co-chairmen of the Conference on Former Yugoslavia in order to 
arrive at a comprehensive agreement more easily. 
  Lord Owen, one of the two co-chairmen, also warned on 
Saturday that there would be no progress in the talks until the 
expiry of NATO's ultimatum to Bosnian Serbs--that they would be 
bombed unless they withdrew their heavy weapons to 20 km from 
the center of Sarajevo by the midnight of February 20. 
  Lord Owen said that the Moslems would wait to see the 
results 
of this ultimatum, so that it will not be possible to get the 
peace process moving before the expiry of this deadline.

  [Text] Geneva, 12 Feb (TANJUG) -- The republic of Srpska 
[RS] delegation at the Geneva talks today distributed its 
platform to reporters. It outlines the delegation's further 
activities in the course of future peace negotiations on Bosnia, 
in a situation where the Bosnian Muslims have rejected the 
European Union [EU] plan. 
  The five-point document states that the RS assembly has 
withdrawn the territorial concessions it initially offered 
because the Muslims have rejected the EU action plan as a 
formula for resolving the crisis, according to which they would 
get 33.3 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina's territory. 
  In the continuation of the peace process the RS delegation, 
the platform points out, will proceed from the real state of 
affairs -- on the basis of the EU plan -- and the concept of a 
union of three republics in ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The RS is a sovereign and independent state constituted in 
line with the universal right of a people to self-determination 
and it reserves the right to enter unions with other states. 
According to the published platform, the capital of the RS is 
Serbian Sarajevo (new Sarajevo). A separate peace agreement for 
the Sarajevo area, as envisaged under the peace plan, should be 
promptly signed in order to facilitate the talks on placing the 
city under UN administration. 
  The RS borders, the platform says, will correspond to the 
factual situation on the ground, and also the RS would have an 
outlet to the Adriatic Sea (according to international law - the 
Corfu Declaration [1917], the Saint-Germain Charter [1919], and 
other international treaties), while some territories can be 
considered to be disputed and under a special regime. 
  The borders between the Serb and Muslim states can, for the 
purpose of creating unified territories, be established by 
political dialogue, taking communications and other factors into 
consideration, and in this way a solution to the disputed 
territories might be found in a peaceful way. 
  The borders between the Serb and Croat states in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will be defined in the framework of a 
comprehensive Serb-Croat solution. 
  The RS delegation proposes that the three warring sides 
immediately sign a peace agreement and enable a modus vivendi in 
the expectation of a final solution. 
  The RS will, the platform says further, continue to take 
part 
in the peace negotiations on the basis of the EU plans, but it 
requests equal treatment in the negotiations. This means the 
abolition or suspension of the sanctions and the cessation of 
all threats against the Serbs. 
  Finally, any violation of the integrity of the RS will be 
considered as an act of aggression, the platform unveiled by the 
RS delegation at the peace talks says.

<F P=106> [Statements by Thorvald Stoltenberg, cochairman of the </F>
Geneva conference, and Radovan Karadzic, president of the 
republic of Srpska, on the Geneva talks; place and date not 
given -- recorded; Karadzic and Stoltenberg speak in English 
with superimposed translation into Serbo-Croatian] 
  [Text] [Stoltenberg] It has been confirmed again that all 
three sides will continue to act according to the plan of action 
of the European Union, which means on the union of the three 
republics. To be more precise, Sarajevo will be under UN 
administration, Mostar under European Union administration. The 
Bosnian Presidency will be given one-third of the territories. 
So far, we have not managed to overcome the issue of 
territories. In the coming days, the United States and Russia 
are going to talk actively with the conflicting sides in order 
to be able to see whether the negotiating process can be 
continued. We will then meet again at the end of this month or 
the beginning of March. Progress in the talks: That means 
that I can look somebody in the eye and say that we are closer 
to peace than we were on Friday, at the beginning of the talks. 
No, I could not say that. Therefore, we now have the agreement 
that Sarajevo will be under UN administration, but we do not 
have an agreement that we will take Sarajevo by storm first. 
  [Karadzic] We have invested a great effort to give the 
Muslim Republic first 30 percent and then 33 percent of the 
territory. However, they have expanded their demand to 15 more 
towns, seven from the Croats and eight from the Serbs. It is 
obvious that they have rejected the plan of the European Union. 
They are using the method of delaying in order to gain time and 
cause military intervention with a view of improving the 
situation in and around Sarajevo. This is why they have 
rejected the plan on Sarajevo that was accepted a few days ago 
in cooperation with Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg. 
  We must stress here that the Muslims are not taking peace 
seriously and that the threats by the international community 
are encouraging the Muslims not to sign peace but to continue 
fighting. If they fight for territories legitimately then nobody 
can guarantee 33.33 percent to them. They are gambling. 
  As regards threats, they are going to threaten, whatever we 
do, because our behavior did not cause these threats. The 
reason for the NATO threats is NATO itself. Problems within 
NATO are the reason for the threats. 
  Besides, Mr. Juppe, French minister of foreign affairs who 
is 
trying to pull the United States into the chaos and push it into 
the conflict, is trying to compromise NATO. If NATO interferes 
in a conflict on one side, this is the end of NATO. 
  We can completely guarantee the security of those people who 
are working on humanitarian aid in the republic of Srpska.

<F P=106> [By Michael Adler] </F>
  [Text] Geneva, Feb 13 (AFP) -- The mainly Moslem Bosnian 
Government is ready to cut a deal for peace without trying to 
exploit NATO's air strike threat to revive its dream of a full 
multi-ethnic state, Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic told 
AFP. "We have agreed to reorganize our country," he said in an 
interview late Saturday [12 February] in Geneva. 
  He was answering questions about the Moslems "bottom line" 
-- 
their minimal demands as the West finally takes decisive steps 
to end the 22-month-old Bosnian war. Washington has presented 
itself as the savior of the Moslems. 
  The latest round of E.C.-UN-mediated peace talks ended here 
Saturday without any progress as direct US and Russian diplomacy 
took over with the clock ticking on NATO's deadline for Serbs to 
end their siege of Sarajevo. If heavy weapons are not withdrawn 
by midnight next Sunday, NATO warplanes will destroy the guns. 
  The Bosnians insist on the idea of a united Bosnia but this 
would be under the already accepted formula of three ethnic 
mini-states, one each for the warring Moslems, Serbs and Croats. 
Bosnia became independent in April 1992 as a state without 
ethnic divisions. 
  The main remaining problem in the formula, which allocates 
one-third of Bosnia to the Moslems, is the 15 areas claimed by 
the Moslems but held now by either Croats or Serbs. Silajdzic 
said he wanted these areas "to be demilitarized and put under UN 
administration until we stop the war." This would apparently be 
a way of bypassing the bitterly intractable disputes over places 
like Zvornik in eastern Bosnia. Zvornik, on the border with 
Serbia, has been described by one analyst here as the "Serbs' 
Golan Heights," a strategic town they would never give up. 
  Silajdzic is equally stubborn about Zornik, one of the prime 
sites of ethnic cleansing, where the 70 percent non-Serbian 
population was driven out. "Those still alive," Silajdzic said 
bitterly, must one day return. "We must not accept gains by 
force," he said. 
  He said, however, that the Bosnian Government understood 
that 
the Americans, the driving force behind the NATO initiative, 
have not given them a carte blanche for re-taking territory. 
  Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic on Saturday here 
expressed concern about the advantage Moslem infantry will soon 
have. "Moslems have three times more numerous infantry than the 
Serbs. Serbian weaponry was the element of strategic balance. 
If we put our heavy weaponry under (UN) control, then the 
Moslem infantry should be under control too," he said. But 
infantry and light arms are not mentioned in the NATO ultimatum 
issued February 9. 
  Asked if his troops would take advantage of the situation, 
Silajdzic said emphatically: "They will not." He said the 
Bosnians would not risk their credibility. 
  Silajdzic said the outlines for peace have become clear. 
NATO's military pressure has been matched by a geopolitical 
forcing that leaves the Serbs little choice but to stop the war. 
For instance, the neighboring patron of the Bosnian Serbs, 
Serbia President Slobodan Milosevic is a man "condemned to 
peace," Silajdzic said. International economic sanctions have 
put Serbia in a position where Milosevic can not be defiant. "I 
think he's dragging that country into an abyss," Silajdzic said. 
  Russia, anxious to share in the peacemaking role with the 
United States, is also expected to pressure Bosnian Serbs to 
compromise, analysts here said. 
  Silajdzic said NATO's active involvement had restored "a 
balance of power." "There is a recognition that superpowers 
must lead and that not being involved eventually leads to 
dangerous situations where loss of life and resources is 
inevitable," he said. 
  But he still described himself as a disillusioned man. "We 
have sanctions (arms embargo on former Yugoslavia), we have 
shells coming in and we have grey-haired children (in Sarajevo 
from the long siege). What more could there be, an atomic 
bomb?" he asked.

  [Text] [Correspondent] Would you please be so kind as to 
comment on Lord Owen's statement to the effect that you have 
agreed to the new proposal on the Bosnian union? According to 
that proposal, the Serbs would not have the right to leave the 
Bosnian union. 
  [Karadzic] No, we have accepted the Bosnian union, but 
according to the Muslim-Serbian declaration, we have the right 
to leave it whenever we wish. We may be within the union or 
outside it. If at any given moment this is easier for reaching 
peace, we are going to accept the union as well. 
  [Correspondent] Do you think that the danger of air strikes 
is greater or smaller as compared to the situation two days ago? 
  [Karadzic] This has never depended on our behavior. This is 
an internal problem of the NATO pact.

  [Text] [Announcer] Jerzy Milewski, the deputy national 
defense minister and head of the National Security Office 
attached to the president, told the Polish Radio First Program 
that the Partnership for Peace agreement signed in Brussels 
recently by Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak contains very 
positive elements with regard to our country's joining the NATO 
Treaty structures, but at this stage it, unfortunately, does not 
guarantee political security for us. 
  [Begin Milewski recording] I consider the Partnership for 
Peace program very good as a transitional measure that will 
speed up and facilitate Poland's full membership in NATO, 
membership as an equal partner, and as a partner equally 
valuable to our future NATO partners. 
  The Partnership for Peace program has, however, been 
criticized. It has been criticized by the highest state 
officials in the country, by President Lech Walesa and by 
Foreign Affairs Minister Andrzej Olechowski, as a program that 
does not give us the necessary political protection, protection 
needed at this particular moment against the growing threat, now 
only political and verbal, from the East. Increasingly 
frequently we hear from Moscow voices that give indications that 
a return to imperial, expansionist policies is increasingly 
probable. Because at the moment this threat is only political 
and is expressed in words, not in deeds or military action, and 
thank God, there is no military threat yet, today we only need 
political protection. The transitional period when our Army 
adapts itself to NATO can and must take a few years. [end

  [Text] Michal Strak, head of the Council of Ministers 
office, has denied that Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak allegedly 
consulted with the president on his decisions concerning 
personnel changes in the top posts at the Finance Ministry. 
Minister Strak said during the "Morning Signals" program that 
any suggestions that the prime minister succumbed to pressure 
from outside were untrue. 
  [Begin recording] [Strak] I can say that the prime minister 
is conducting an entirely independent policy, and any suspicions 
that he is guided by anyone from outside are simply 
preposterous. I am surprised that these suspicions appear at all. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Is the coalition agreement 
going 
to be renegotiated? 
  [Strak] I think that the coalition agreement is a good 
document, and I think the political part is being implemented. 
The economic part should be implemented as well, although the 
matter is much more difficult. There is great difficulty in 
reconciling what is necessary for maintaining a certain 
macroeconomic balance, which has been achieved in Poland and 
which is appreciated by the government, with the necessity to 
meet the most severe and urgent public needs. 
  Public expectations in this domain found their expression in 
the demonstration. We are treating this event with full 
seriousness because people who took part in it carry the burden 
of economic change in Poland on their backs. There is 
undoubtedly a need to reduce the burden, to make it lighter, 
although this is an extremely difficult task. I think this 
government has been aware of the difficulties. Some decisions 
are made within the government's abilities, but we are fully 
aware that these decisions do not resolve the issue. [end

<F P=106> [Article by J.B.L.: "Who After Borowski?"] </F>
  [Text] Who is the new candidate of the Democratic Left 
Alliance [SLD] for the post of finance minister? This was the 
most closely guarded secret of the left. Most probably it is an 
SLD man, even though this information, passed by Reuter (which 
quoted Aleksander Kwasniewski) was denied by Zbigniew 
Siemiatkowski. It is also certain that no one queries SLD's 
right to appoint its own man to this position. It is not at all 
known, however, whether, just like Marek Borowski, he would be 
simultaneously a minister and the deputy prime minister 
responsible (even theoretically) for the entire economy. 
  On Monday [7 February] evening Prime Minister Waldemar 
Pawlak 
said on television that he would accept the resignation 
submitted by Marek Borowski, despite signals on the part of SLD 
discouraging him from doing so. He did not say, however, when 
the finance minister would stop work. It is not known, 
therefore, whether the Tuesday session of the Council of 
Ministers is the last one with the participation of the deputy 
prime minister and finance minister. It is just as possible as 
the version in line with which he is supposed to stay at this 
post until the Budget Law is passed by the Sejm. As we have 
learned, such doubts are also expressed by other government 
members as well. The politicians of the Polish Peasant Party 
[PSL] voiced the opinion that Borowski should remain in his 
position until the work on the budget is completed, which seems 
to be a logical solution: The prime minister confirmed that the 
government would defend the budget in the version that has been 
submitted in the Sejm. 
  It is easier to answer the following question: Who is SLD's 
candidate for the successor of Marek Borowski? We have learned 
that Professor Grzegorz Kolodko, with whom talks were held when 
Waldemar Pawlak was selecting people for his government, is out 
of the question. At that time, the conditions submitted by 
Kolodko were not accepted; it would be even more difficult to 
agree to them now. It is also hard to suppose that he would 
himself be interested in taking over this difficult post in a 
situation that is far more complex than it was last autumn. 
  SLD will also not propose Henryk Chmielak for this post. 
Right now he is the first deputy of the finance minister -- he 
holds the rank of a secretary of state. The list, which was not 
agreed with SLD and which Aleksander Luczak submitted to the 
Belvedere in October 1993, included the name of Chmielak as a 
candidate for the head of the Finance Ministry. However, SLD 
probably wants someone who would be linked with the party as 
much as Marek Borowski; this condition is not met by the present 
deputy minister. For the very same reason (as well as a few 
others) none of the members of the present leadership of the 
ministry come into play. 
  The natural cadre reserve for any party are its deputies. 
However, as early as last autumn it was clear that the reserve 
bench of both coalition members was rather short; it has become 
even shorter since that time. 
  However, on the list of SLD Sejm deputies it is not easy to 
find someone who could fill the position vacated by Marek 
Borowski. Among the members of the Budget Committee, who are 
naturally most familiar with the problems of the state's 
finances, only Professor Jozef Kaleta is an acknowledged 
economist; however, this acknowledgement is rather related to 
the previous epoch. He is probably not a sufficiently strong 
candidate as well, but according to the information that we have 
obtained, SLD leaders believe that it is a character of 
considerable authority that can constitute a counterbalance for 
the PSL-dominated part of the government. 
  Perhaps it will be Ireneusz Sekula, head of the Main Customs 
Office? He once was a deputy prime minister (in the Rakowski 
government), responsible for the economy. Aleksander 
Kwasniewski met with him yesterday morning. However, we learned 
from a well-informed source that Sekula is not the politician 
that the SLD leaders spoke about.

<F P=106> [Article by E.Cz., E.K., and Ma.S.: "Efficiency of Policy </F>
of Silence; SLD Applies PSL Methods"] 
  [Text] The communique issued after Tuesday's [8 
February] talks between the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and the 
Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], which was general and apparently 
laconic, is what we wanted to see the most--one can hear such 
statements in SLD circles. During the talks, both sides 
confirmed that the coalition will continue, they said they would 
jointly support the government's budget draft, and they also 
said they decided the Finance Ministry will remain in the SLD 
domain. The conditions which had been set earlier by SLD will 
probably be the subject of further talks and negotiations. The 
name of the new finance minister (who will also be a deputy 
prime minister for economic affairs) will be announced by SLD 
prior to the second reading of the budget draft, that is to say 
next week at the latest. 
  It seems that SLD leaders' serious fears concerning the 
chances for maintaining the governing coalition, were caused 
first of all by the prime minister's television appearance where 
he was critical of a straight, liberal continuation of economic 
policies, and at the same time he stressed the need to include 
social needs in the budget to a greater extent. The second 
reason was Lech Walesa's involvement in the crisis. He reminded 
everyone of his constitutional powers and of a possibility of 
presidential rules. SLD was relieved to see the compromise with 
PSL, despite Marek Borowski's exclusion from the government 
being the price for the compromise. According to SLD Spokesman 
Zbigniew Siemiatkowski, the president's involvement at the last 
moment proves that if there was anybody to gain from the crisis 
in the government, it was the president. 
  Andrzej Zakrzewski, chief of the president's Political 
Service Bureau, when asked to comment on the view that the 
president--by his signing of Borowski's resignation--had an 
impact on the speedy signing of the new agreement within the 
coalition, said that Lech Walesa "does not get involved in the 
coalition's affairs, but he simply takes note of what the 
coalition and the government 'produce.'" When asked whether he 
thinks the president accepted Borowski's resignation very fast, 
Zakrzewski replied: "The president is always fast...." 
  Apart from three fundamental issues--the coalition's 
stability, support for the government's budget draft, and 
leaving the finance minister and deputy prime minister in the 
domain of SLD--no other topics were discussed. 
  But SLD hopes it will be able to return to talks with PSL 
concerning the conditions that had been set earlier which--among 
others--pertained to defining the powers of deputy prime 
ministers, consultations within the coalition concerning 
appointments of new local governors, and establishing the post 
of government spokesman. According to SLD, the most important 
thing right now is to enact the budget in the form proposed by 
the government; Marek Borowski--who after his resignation will 
return to work as a Sejm deputy in the Sejm Economic Policy, 
Budget, and Finance Commission--will "protect" the budget draft 
on SLD's behalf. 
  In its contacts with the mass media, SLD decided to apply 
PSL's method. SLD says it was a bad idea to be open in 
supplying information to journalists during the most recent 
conflict. "Right now, we will talk less and do more"--SLD 
decided. While recognizing the efficiency of PSL's silence, 
left-wing politicians intend to closely watch the political 
scene and wait for PSL's next move. 
  Aleksander Kwasniewski, a leader of SLD, refused to give any 
information to journalists yesterday. PSL politicians say he 
was full of bitterness. According to unofficial information, a 
joint principle of commenting on the recent events as little as 
possible, was adopted during the evening coalition talks. There 
are probably no chances for establishing a post of press 
spokesman for the government. Government circles say that 
establishing such a post would mean that the prime minister's 
information policy is different than the government's.

<F P=106> [Article by Kazimierz Groblewski: "SLD Is Losing--President </F>
Will Gain"] 
  [Text] Lech Walesa waited out the coalition crisis in the 
mountains. He will return to see a slightly different political 
configuration; this situation seems to be more favorable to him. 
  The coalition has survived the crises, but it has changed as 
well. The Polish Peasant Party [PSL] gained; Prime Minister 
Pawlak won the position as the real leader of the coalition. 
The Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] lost this round quite 
noticeably. 
<H5>  These Facts Will Strengthen the President </H5>
  The prime minister is very polite toward the Belweder; he 
has 
accepted its rules of the game, at least as far as the filling 
of the deputy ministerial posts in the presidential ministries 
(the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs--MSZ, and the Ministry of National Defense) is 
concerned. He does not demand positions for his party 
activists; he settles for the promotions of PSL members who are 
already working in those ministries (examples are the new MSZ 
deputy minister and the new deputy of the Office of State 
Protection chief). PSL members are getting high posts in the 
presidential ministries, which is being kept rather low profile. 
  SLD wants these posts for its own politicians and it has 
exerted pressure on Pawlak to achieve that. Now the weakened 
SLD may take various steps; the possibility cannot be ruled out 
that, wanting to compensate itself for the recent defeat and 
improve its mood, it may start an even more vehement campaign to 
obtain the deputy ministerial posts in the presidential 
ministries. 
  So far Pawlak has resisted--he did not want a war with the 
president. Now he will find it easier to handle the coalition 
partner's demands. In line with the principle that a precedence 
that has been set becomes the rule, it may remind the SLD 
leaders of who calls the shots in the coalition. 
  The psychological aspect of the conflict in the coalition is 
also very important. 
<H5>  Pawlak Took SLD Politicians Aback </H5>
  He turned out to be firm. SLD leaders will now feel greater 
respect for him and will keep themselves at a distance. 
  The personal advantage for Lech Walesa, if he decides to run 
in the presidential elections, is the fact that the position of 
Aleksander Kwasniewski has been weakened quite considerably. Of 
course, we still have a long way to go before the elections, and 
the situation may change more than once. Today Walesa gains the 
following: Kwasniewski will no longer be treated, also by the 
mass media, so unequivocally in the good spirit of the current 
configuration, as the main player, as the "prime minister 
without portfolio." His image was tarnished quite considerably. 
The prime minister is Pawlak. 
  Kwasniewski is "merely" the leader of one of the two 
coalition groupings--it is the grouping that is today 
politically weaker at that. 
<H5>  Curbing the Increasing Popularity of Kwasniewski </H5>
  It is a present that Walesa received from Pawlak a year and 
a 
half before the presidential elections. However, it may be the 
Belweder's mistake not to consider Pawlak as Walesa's future 
countercandidate in the elections. 
  The weaker SLD means also one more advantage for the 
Belweder. In the Army, police, and the special forces the 
Belweder and SLD are competing for influence. In this game, 
which seems to be very important to the president, the weaker 
SLD becomes, the better for the Belweder. The weakening of SLD 
after the last conflict may be seen by some employees of those 
services as an indicator showing where the real and stable 
authority center is. 
  One can also say that any conflict in the coalition is 
favorable to the Belweder because it diverts the interest of the 
mass media from it.

<F P=106> [Article by Renata Wisniewska: "Central Bank or Office?; </F>
Experts for the PSL and the SLD Suggest A Different Monetary 
Policy"] 
  [Text] On Tuesday, 8 February, experts for the Polish 
Peasant Party [PSL] and the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] 
presented the management of the Polish National Bank [NBP] with 
a draft of the principles of monetary policies for 1994. 
According to those principles, the main goals of monetary 
policies are: lowering the inflation rate by the end of 1994 to 
the level of 23 percent (in relation to December) and to the 
level of 27 percent (in relation to midyear), increasing the 
growth rate in the economy, limiting the unemployment rate, and 
developing exports. The document conflicts in a fundamental way 
with a draft of principles presented to the Sejm by the NBP. 
  The planned goals listed in the document prepared by the 
experts for the SLD and the PSL are supposed to be implemented, 
among other things, through a "real increase in money supply to 
economic units and to households, at least up to the level of 
the planned increase in the GDP--that is, up to the level of 169 
trillion zlotys [Z]," (the NBP suggests Z155 trillion), "through 
an appropriate shaping of the interest rates with regard to bank 
deposits and credits in relation to the inflation rate," 
"through a flexible shaping of policies on foreign currency 
rates, which would take into account the inflation rate," and 
through an increase in the trend to save. The experts think 
that the state budget's debt due to financing the budget deficit 
cannot exceed Z35 trillion. It will be implemented by 
purchasing Treasury notes from the Finance Ministry. 
  To implement the government proexport policies, the NBP is 
supposed to increase its contribution to the Corporation for 
Insurance of Export Credits [KUKE] up to the 25-percent level. 
In addition, the NBP is supposed to devote part of its foreign 
currency reserves for the purpose of financing modernization 
investments in small and medium-size companies. 
  The coalition experts also write that the central bank will 
undertake necessary measures aimed at bringing banks back to 
health, among other things by devoting for that purpose the 
amount of Z3 trillion; by decreasing obligatory reserves; by 
purchasing shares, long-term bonds, and bills of exchange; by 
providing guarantees for deposits; and by refinancing credits. 
The draft also envisages an increase of the trend to save in 
zlotys, through the NBP's introduction of the burden of 
obligatory reserves on foreign-currency deposits. The experts 
assume that commercial banks will be able to get loans from the 
NBP mainly in the form of rediscounting credits and pawn 
credits. The banks' debts incurred in this way would be 
controlled by the NBP, depending on the monetary situation in 
the country. 
  The draft also envisages the NBP's cooperation with the 
government while establishing a system of lessening the debt 
burden of economic enterprises. This applies to those companies 
that are profitable in terms of their productivity. The NBP is 
supposed to undertake measures for improving the earnings 
situation and for a restructuring of the companies' indebtedness. 
  RZECZPOSPOLITA has asked Witold Kozinski (first deputy of 
the 
NBP's chairperson) to comment on the proposal submitted by the 
SLD and PSL experts. According to him, an agreement on 
increasing the money supply in 1994 and on the NBP's 
contribution in financing the budget deficit will not be reached 
at this stage of the talks. W. Kozinski said that an increase 
in the money supply of Z155 trillion is very large anyway. The 
Sejm will be an umpire on this issue. If the Sejm adopts an 
increase in the money supply to Z169 trillion, it will have to 
bear the responsibility for price increases," Witold Kozinski 
said [no opening quotes as published]. 
  According to the first deputy of the NBP's chairperson, the 
draft has many drawbacks. For instance, the NBP's management 
has already made a decision on increasing its contribution in 
the capital of KUKE; it also made an appropriate decision on 
introducing obligatory reserves in foreign-currency accounts. 
An ordinance on this issue by the NBP's chairperson has been in 
effect since 31 January of this year. According to the 
provisions now in effect, the NBP cannot devote part of the 
foreign-currency reserves to finance modernization investments. 
It could do this only by borrowing the necessary means on the 
market. In W. Kozinski's view, there is also a contradiction 
with regard to basic credits. He stressed that the main goal of 
the NBP's monetary policies is to lower the inflation rate by 
the end of 1994 to the level of 23 percent, on the basis of the 
period from December 1993 to December 1993 [as published], as 
well as the kind of cooperation in implementing economic 
policies that would make this goal realistic. Going over the 
planned increase in money supply to the level above Z155 
trillion could take place, assuming the inflation figures will 
be implemented successfully. According to W. Kozinski, if the 
practical rate of price increases does not exceed 23 percent on 
a yearly basis, the NBP will not oppose increasing the money 
supply to over Z155 trillion, but decisions on this issue should 
not be made earlier than in the second half of the year.

  [Excerpt] Warsaw, 12 Feb--At Saturday's meeting with 
Western European Assembly Chairman Dudley Smith, National 
Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk said that among the most 
important problems that the Armed Forces of the Polish Republic 
is facing are the process of restructuring the Army, integration 
with the European security system, and technical development of 
the forces that are connected with it. 
  Kolodziejczyk stated that no breakthrough was made in 
technological cooperation with the West. Asked by Smith about 
the budget of the Ministry of National Defense, Kolodziejczyk 
stated that it was insufficient to maintain the current 
technical state of the Army and to ensure proper training of the 
forces. According to Kolodziejczyk, such a budget also 
precludes an even deployment of the forces, according to the 
principle of equal security of borders. The Polish minister 
expressed hope that the Partnership for Peace initiative was not 
only leading to NATO but also to the WEU [Western European 
Union]. 
  The chairman of the WEU Assembly, who is participating in a 
two-day seminar in Poland entitled "The WEU Look at the Security 
of Central and Eastern European Countries", said in a 
conversation with Kolodziejczyk that he hoped Poland and other 
countries in Central and Eastern Europe would be granted 
affiliated status this coming May. He also stated that he would 
like central Europe to start to acquire "the same significance 
as western Europe". [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by K.Gr. and P.W.R.: "Against Raises on the Streets </F>
of Warsaw; 5 Km of `Solidarity'"] 
  [Text] Approximately 40,000 "Solidarity" unionists 
demonstrated on Wednesday [9 February] in Warsaw against price 
rises and for salary increases. "Down with communism," 
"Thieves," "Government go on the dole," they shouted. A 
"Solidarity" delegation presented Michal Strak, head of the 
Office of the Council of Ministers [URM], with a petition in 
which they demanded, among other things, that the budget bill be 
amended and the packet of bills related to the "Pact on State 
Enterprise" be passed by 15 March. If this deadline is not met, 
"Solidarity" Chairman Marian Krzaklewski does not rule out the 
possibility of a strike. For a while Strak left the premises of 
URM, but he was heckled and quickly went back inside the 
building. 
  "There are 40,000 of us here," announced Krzaklewski as he 
started the demonstration at Pilsudski Square. As he was in 
front of the URM building, he estimated that approximately 
100,000 people were taking part in the demonstration. It was 
indeed an enormous demonstration, but the former figure seems to 
be closer to the truth. The crowd of protesters stretched from 
the URM building to Krakowskie Przedmiescie Street 
(approximately 5 km away). 
  "Those who are in power right now have declared: It does not 
have to be this way any longer. It does not have to--because it 
is worse," said Krzysztof Mlodzik, chairman of the Secretariat 
of Mining and Energy. He warned the authorities that "if they 
want a conflict with `Solidarity,' they will have one." 
  "We do not want to support the perfidious practices that 
have 
been deceitfully called privatization," said Tomasz Wojcik, 
chairman of the Lower Silesia Region; he demanded "giving 
property to citizens en mass." At the head of the 
demonstration, Ursus unionists were competing with the 
supporters of the National Committee. When the former were 
shouting "Down with judecja [probably reference to the 
Democratic Union allegedly being dominated by Jews]" and "Down 
with Walesa," while National Committee supporters were chanting 
"Solidarity." 
  "We do not want to die of hunger in line with the election 
promises," "Sejmocracy should be submitted for file-checking," 
"Instead of paying too much for electricity, let us chase the 
communists away from here," "Take your hands out of our 
pockets," "Nation is working, government is wasting," "Kuron 
gave soup, Miller showed his behind," "Communists are promising 
things, nation is suffering hunger," "SdRP-PSL [Social Democracy 
of the Polish Republic-Polish Peasant Party]: You have given us 
the games and circus. Now is the time for bread," were only 
some of the slogans heard during the demonstration. 
  The most popular slogans were "Down with communism," 
"Communists--affair mongers," "Communists go to Cuba." 
  "Where is your honor, where is the fatherland," people 
shouted in front of the URM, where there is the inscription 
"Honor, Fatherland." 
  Lodz Region representatives were carrying an effigy 
representing Waldemar Pawlak (with horns) and Lech Walesa 
(wearing a ribbon with the word "Traitor" written on it). The 
effigy of Pawlak was burned in front of URM. The union members 
shouted: "Down with Miller, the affair monger" (Leszek Miller is 
a deputy from Lodz), "Lodz wants jobs, not the dole." 
  The unionists threw a 1.5-meter red casket over the barriers 
surrounding URM. They carried, among other things, a black 
plaque with a white inscription: "The government, rest in peace." 
  A railway orchestra was playing; one could hear whistles, 
trumpets; many participants of the demonstration were wearing 
union caps and shirts. 
  In a speech in front of URM, Marian Krzaklewski said that 
the 
reason for the demonstration was, among other things, the fact 
that in another year characterized by economic growth, incomes 
are on the wane. "Solidarity" supports a "market-solidarity" 
state, and not a state of "capital oligarchy." If the latter is 
formed, "Solidarity" will overthrow it. Krzaklewski suggested 
that the work week be reduced by two hours, which he believes 
would allow us to decrease unemployment by approximately 300,000. 
  The group of demonstrators from Ursus was not able to 
continue the demonstration from URM to the Belvedere, where they 
say "the greatest evil " lies. The determining factor here was 
the behavior of protesters from Gdansk Region.

  [Text] An agreement was reached early this morning between 
the strike committee and the board of the Jastrzebie Coal 
Company. The Miners Trade Union, however, has withdrawn from 
the signing of the protocol. 
  [Correspondent Adam Sojka] The agreement envisages a 
7.2-percent pay increase for January, compared to December last 
year, and a 10-percent increase for February, as compared to 
January. Earnings will remain at the February level in March. 
Moreover, the union side has pledged that it will only use 
legal means of protest in the future, means that are provided by 
the law on trade unions. 
  At the same time, the board announced that it will request 
the law-enforcement bodies to stop criminal proceedings against 
people involved in the blockade of the board's offices and radio 
broadcasting networks in collieries. Both sides have agreed 
that no pay is due for the period of the strike, and the 
financial compensation for people who did not work will take 
place after making up for lost output. The board of the 
company, however, stipulated that the agreement would come into 
force when it is signed by all the trade unions. Only the 
Miners Trade Union refrained from initialling the agreement. At 
the moment, negotiations are being held concerning this matter. 
Unofficially, we have learned that the strike may be suspended, 
possibly even today.

  [Text] The TV "Wiadomosci" and "Panorama" programs carried 
reports yesterday on the signing of an accord between the board 
of the Jastrzebie Coal Company [JSW] and the Trade Union of 
Miners of Poland [ZZGwP], which was to end the strike at the 
seven mines of this company. Unfortunately, the miners at these 
mines are still on strike. 
  Meanwhile, as Romuald Boszko, press spokesman of the protest 
staff at the JSW, has reported, the signing of this accord has 
no significance with regard to the course of the strike. The 
strike is directed, the press spokesman stressed, by the protest 
staff, the composition of which does not include the ZZGwP. The 
protest staff, on the other hand, does include three other trade 
unions: Kontra, Solidarity, and Solidarity '80. The dispatcher 
at the State Hard Coal Agency in Katowice has confirmed that the 
work forces have not commenced work at any of the JSW mines. 
  Beginning at 1500 today, additional talks will take place 
with the protesting miners at the provisional headquarters of 
the JSW. As we discovered at the board of the company, a 
consensus has been reached on 95 percent of the proposals. 
There is still a lack of accord with regard to compensation for 
the time spent on strike.

  [Text] According to initial data for 1994, Poland has 
fulfilled the standby agreement reached in November 1992 with 
the IMF. The fulfillment of this agreement is a condition for a 
20-percent reduction--that is. about $8 billion in government 
debts to the states who are our creditors grouped in the Paris 
Club. The club is to make a decision on this matter at the 
beginning of April.

  [Text] Of the 82 industries belonging to the armaments 
sector, only 31 will remain, Deputy Industry Minister Roman 
Czerwinski said at a news conference. 
  [Begin Czerwinski recording] This does not mean that 51 
enterprises have been closed down. It means that military 
production has been moved from those enterprises, or will be 
moved from them. Why do we have to do this? Well, there was a 
time when our armaments industry was geared to production not 
just for our army but also for the army of the Warsaw Pact. The 
needs of that army, the needs of a global conflict and the 
provisions for such a scenario were very, very much higher than 
they are in the present defense doctrine, which only envisages 
the defense of the country. 
  We do not intend to privatize this sector. We want to retain 
proprietry control over these enterprises. Of these 31 
enterprises 10 to 12 are in very good financial shape, a further 
10 are improving. [end recording] 
  The minister imparted the information that the Ministry of 
National Defense [MON] had, and has no intention of buying the 
Czech Albatros training and combat aircraft instead of the 
Polish Iryda aircraft. Let me remind you that two days ago the 
MON refused to buy the 36 commissioned Irydas produced by 
WSK-Mielec. The refusal was explained by, among other things, 
the fact that these aircraft were not the training and combat 
versions the ministry ordered and that their price was not 
competitive enough. 
  The Mielec Solidarity spokesman announced that there will be 
a protest regarding this matter. 
  [Begin unidentified Solidarity spokesman recording] I know 
that Minister Kolodziejczyk is not opposed to the Iryda plane. 
All that was said was that a training plane was not, at the 
moment, needed by the army. I knowing the Iryda plane, and I 
know that it is a training and combat plane. Following my 
meeting with deputy minister Kuriata, Minister Pol intends to 
meet Minister Kolodziejczyk. The problem, of course, is: Where 
to find the means to purchase the plane? [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by E.Cz. and E.K.: "After Cabinet Crisis; Budget </F>
Will Be the Test"] 
  [Text] It is quite possible that, despite the 
coalition compromise, the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] will not 
take a unanimous stand in the voting on the budget. The 
Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] in turn says that it will impose 
complete club discipline. According to the SLD, introducing 
voting discipline within the PSL is exclusively Waldemar 
Pawlak's business. It is hard to tell to what extent the 
behavior of some Sejm deputies for the PSL is just a game under 
which they will vote in favor of the government's budget draft 
anyway. 
<H5>  The PSL Keeps Playing </H5>
  "Voting on the budget will be political, it will be about 
the 
stability of the governing coalition, and it will be a test of 
the PSL's and the SLD's abilities to jointly work out a 
compromise-based economic program," says the PSL's Janusz 
Piechocinski. Despite the fact that the governing coalition's 
leaders have obliged themselves to jointly support the 
government budget draft, the PSL Sejm deputies of the Sejm 
Agricultural Commission continue to demand an increase in 
agricultural expenditures by 10 trillion zlotys [Z]. The 
commission adopted a proposal for such an amendment as early as 
two weeks ago. The commission's chairman, the PSL's Roman 
Jagielinski, defends the pproach: "I will not change my view 
because I am bound by a decision by the commission and by the 
PSL Chief Council [no closing quotation as published]. As early 
as December, the Chief Council imposed an obligation on its 
members who are Sejm deputies to increase the budget means for 
agriculture by Z4 trillion, out of which, let us recall here, 
half has already been taken into account in the government's 
budget draft. The Sejm Agriculture Commission is demanding an 
additional Z10 trillion; it says there is a necessity to 
increase subsidies from the budget for more areas linked to 
agriculture, among them banks. Jagielinski explains that the 
contradiction between a statement by the prime minister (PSL 
chief) and the position taken by the Sejm Agriculture Commission 
is caused by a lack of an information policy inside the PSL. 
The issue of supporting the government's budget draft was not 
discussed with the PSL authorities, not even on the eve of the 
coalition summit, during which leaders of both parties obliged 
themselves to jointly support the budget draft that had been 
submitted. 
  Jagielinski allows for the possibility of a division within 
the PSL Deputies Club during the vote on the budget, even if 
clubwide discipline is introduced. Other PSL members are also 
talking about a lack of consultation on the issue between the 
PSL authorities and the Sejm deputies. "It is not known to what 
extent the demands for increases in budgetary expenditures are 
the PSL's tactical maneuver and to what extent the maneuver has 
been agreed upon with the coalition partner," Piechocinski says. 
Both parties could be eager to convince the electorate that 
they fought till the end to keep election promises. Lack of 
budget means could be a good explanation for consenting to the 
government's version. 
  But the SLD regards adopting the budget in the government's 
version as a principle from which the party has no intention of 
deviating. According to assurances coming out of the SLD 
Deputies Club, there will be a discipline enforced during the 
vote. SLD leaders do not expect Sejm deputies for the 
All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement to break away from the voting. 
The trade unionists' moods should be calmed by shifts of 
individual items within the budget and by devoting these means 
for social goals and for professional activation of the 
unemployed. 
<H5>  Left Wing Gathers Strength </H5>
  It is not known whether the coalition's stability and 
durability will be affected by an amendment submitted by the 
Sejm Ownership Transformations Commission to "Directions of 
Privatizations" contained in the budget. The amendment 
introduces greater supervision by the Sejm over privatization of 
economic enterprises in strategic branches. That provision is 
also included in the coalition agreement, but, according to some 
of the Sejm deputies for the SLD, it is so flexible that it is 
hard to predict what the provision will mean in practice. If 
Sejm deputies impose too strict a control on measures undertaken 
by the ownership transformations minister, that could become 
another reason for a deteriorating situation in the government 
and the coalition. 
  After the Cabinet crisis, which has been perceived as the 
SLD's loss, Aleksander Kwasniewski's closest associates went on 
unscheduled vacations. Until the return of the SLD leader from 
Lillehammer, which is supposed to be in the middle of next week, 
they were "forbidden to go within 100 meters of the Sejm 
building." Only sessions by individual commissions are supposed 
to be an alleviating circumstance for those who disobey. 
  Sejm deputies for the SLD announce that, after they are back 
from their vacations, they will begin negotiations.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Croatian Foreign Minister Mate </F>
Granic by unidentified announcer; announcer is in Zagreb studio, 
Granic's location not given; from the "Slikom na Slku" program 
-- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Announcer] Finally, can I ask 
for your comments on today's news carried by REUTERS, which 
cites your letter to Butrus-Ghali -- and today's news conference 
after the meeting with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
delegation -- in which Croatia offers [announcer appears to 
quote] the withdrawal of troops from the border areas in Bosnia 
and in return requests that the UN guarantees security to Croat 
civilians -- in central Bosnia, of course. 
  [Granic] After my talks with [Bosnian] Prime Minister 
[Haris] 
Silajdzic, we made an evaluation and, with the agreement of the 
president of the republic of course, I sent a letter to Mr. 
Butrus-Ghali, the UN secretary general, in which I explained 
that Croatia is proposing the control [by the UN] of all the 
borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina, including those between Croatia 
and Herzegovina, and also that we would -- from the border 
areas, that means south of Buna, south of Mostar -- withdraw our 
units and some elements of the Croatian Army from the left bank 
[of the Neretva River]; these we have been calling volunteers 
because they have been and are now -- although the international 
comunity calls them elements of the Croatian Army. [I 
explained] that we would withdraw them from the right [as heard] 
bank -- but in the spirit of the fact that General [Ante] Roso 
and General [Rasim] Delic [Croat and Muslim army commanders, 
respectively] would meet -- and this was confirmed today -- on 
18 February in Split in order to reach agreement on a 
comprehensive cease-fire between Croatian and Muslim forces. 
  On the other hand, we sought from the United Nations the 
complete protection of Croatian enclaves in central Bosnia. 
  [Announcer] So that sentence in the REUTERS news item, in 
which it says -- and I quote -- volunteers as elements of the 
regular Croatian Army would be withdrawn [fails to complete 
sentence]. Who exactly? 
  [Granic] As regards the border areas, that is the Croatian 
Army. And as regards the elements of the Croatian Army -- these 
are volunteers [as heard]. 
  [Announcer] Thank you very much, Mr. Granic, for responding 
to our call and being the guest on "Slikom na Slku" [Picture 
Versus Picture] program.

  [Text] Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and 
minister of foreign affairs, has sent a letter to United Nations 
Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, informing him about the 
constructive atmosphere and results achieved in negotiations 
with Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic in Geneva 
on 9 and 10 February. In his letter Minister Granic informs 
Butrus-Ghali about the readiness displayed by both sides to 
intensify negotiations which have been initiated on the 
resolution of remaining contentious issues and future relations 
between the Croatian and the Bosnian Muslim nations. 
  Minister Granic welcomes the consent given by the 
governments 
of the United States, European, and other countries for pressure 
to be stepped up on all the warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
in order to reach a final solution on the basis of the European 
Union action plan. Minister Granic also expresses support for 
the NATO readiness to use force to lift the siege of Sarajevo, 
which represents the first step in the implementation of that 
plan. 
  The Croatian minister of foreign affairs also informs the UN 
secretary general about Croatia's readiness to meet the request 
of the UN Security Council to reduce tensions between the 
Croatian and Muslim sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in the spirit 
of a cease-fire agreement that the two sides have previously 
signed. 
  The Croatian government will also turn to UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Force] representatives in order to coordinate the 
verification of moves by the Croatian Government and the 
Croatian Defense Council, which should reduce tension and 
rebuild trust between the Croatian and Muslim sides, 
particularly in central Bosnia and in Mostar. 
  The Croatian Government asks the UN Security Council to 
offer 
guarantees with regard to halting the offensive actions of the 
Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina in these areas, in the spirit of the 
aforementioned Geneva negotiations.

  [Text] Zagreb, Feb. 11 KYODO -- The special U.N. 
representative to the former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, said 
Thursday [10 February] that NATO air strikes against Bosnian 
Serbs could escalate the Bosnian civil war and drag U.N. 
peacekeepers into it. 
  NATO warned the Serbs on Wednesday that its warplanes would 
bomb their heavy weapons located around the besieged Bosnian 
capital of Sarajevo unless the guns are withdrawn or put under 
U.N. command by February 21. 
  "The plus and minus impact (of air strikes) must be 
carefully 
considered," Akashi said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE 
at the headquarters of the U.N. Protection Force in Zagreb, 
Croatia. 
  "The military commanders of the U.N. Protection Force also 
believe that air strikes could be useful to promote political 
and diplomatic negotiations, but they see a number of 
complicated questions involved militarily," Akashi said. 
  Akashi said the new cease-fire that U.N. mediators reached 
in 
Wednesday negotiations with the Serbs and the embattled 
Muslim-led Bosnian government will soon be put into a written 
agreement. 
  Its main points are both sides' pledge to honor the 
cease-fire and to pull back their heavy artillery and mortars 
from the area around Sarajevo and to place them under U.N. 
control, he said. 
  Akashi said with regard to the quick conclusion of a lasting 
cease-fire agreement, the NATO ultimatum could turn out to be a 
"plus." 
  However, in negotiations with the Serbs it could also become 
a minus factor, since the Bosnian Muslims took the NATO decision 
as support for their stance. 
  "There remain difficult negotiations on both sides," said 
Akashi, warning against too high hopes for a quick solution. 
  Dozens of cease-fires have collapsed during nearly two years 
of fighting around Sarajevo. 
  Asked if he expects a settlement of the Bosnian conflict 
within the 10-day NATO deadline, Akashi evaded a clear answer. 
"As far as we are concerned, we can only say that we will 
continue our strenuous efforts," he said. 
  He said the U.N. has not yet concluded who is responsible 
for 
the massacre of civilians at a Sarajevo marketplace last weekend. 
  The mortar attack on February 5 killed 68 people and injured 
some 142. Investigation into the attack is extremely difficult 
because the single firing of a mortar leaves few traces on the 
ground, Akashi said. 
  The Serbs have denied they fired the mortar round and claim 
that the Bosnian Muslims staged the incident to fan 
international outrage over ostensible Serbian atrocities.

  [Excerpts] Knin, 12 Feb (TANJUG) -- The constitutive 
session of the new [Serb] Krajina parliament has ended with the 
election of a speaker and two deputy speakers of the assembly, 
and with the formal swearing into office of Milan Martic as 
president [of the RSK (republic of Serbian Krajina)]. At the 
proposal of the Serb Radical Party [SRS], the Assembly, by a 
majority, elected political scientist Branko Vojnic from Beli 
Manastir as its speaker, while Marko Atlagic and Dr. Milan 
Ernjakovic, Krajina Serb Democratic Party [SDS] candidates, were 
elected as deputy speakers. Mirjana Rodic was elected as 
assembly secretary. Thus all assembly officials were elected 
from the ranks of the Krajina SDS-SRS coalition. 
  At the end of the constitutive session, and at the proposal 
of RSK president Milan Martic, the assembly adopted a 
declaration of solidarity with the struggle of the Serb people 
in the Srpska republic [RS], in the wake of the open threats and 
the NATO pact ultimatum. [passage omitted] 
  In the declaration of solidarity with the struggle of the 
Serb people in the RS, and in connection with the NATO pact's 
ultimatum, it is stated that this Assembly "received the news of 
the NATO pact Council's decision to deliver an unacceptable 
ultimatum to the RS with deep disappointment." 
  Such behavior by NATO pact members, the declaration goes on 
to say, is profoundly unjust. The intention to use armed forces 
against the right of a people to self-determination runs counter 
to democracy itself. 
  "The RSK assembly demands of the state executive organs and 
of the armed forces that they consider air attacks by NATO to be 
hostile aggression and that they prevent this by all [available] 
means, and that they assist the defense of the RS in other ways 
according to their capabilities. The full consequences of an 
attack on the RS will be borne by the NATO pact members and the 
United Nations," it says at the end of the declaration.

  [Text] Zagreb, Feb 12 (TANJUG) -- Delegations of the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.) and the Republic of 
Croatia opened talks here on Saturday about the gradual 
normalization of their relations relying on a declaration signed 
in Geneva in January. 
  The delegations are headed by F.R.Y. Vice-Premier Zeljko 
Simic and Croatian Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Mate Granic. 
  The closed-door talks in the Croatian Foreign Ministry 
concentrate on the opening of an F.R.Y. office in Zagreb and a 
Croatian office in Belgrade, a variety of humanitarian 
questions, and the establishment of transport and 
telecommunication links. 
  Having signed the Geneva declaration in mid-January, the 
F.R.Y. and Croatia reasserted readiness for gradual 
normalization of their relations broken in 1991 when Croatia 
forcibly seceded from the former Yugoslav Federation. 
  On January 27 in Geneva, the F.R.Y. and Croatian Government 
delegations agreed to set up joint commissions to deal with the 
question of missing persons, refugees, and humanitarian matters. 
The commission held its first meeting in Zagreb on Saturday. 
  The Yugoslav delegation, as was announced, would be received 
by Croatian president on Saturday evening. 
  It was learnt unofficially that on February 14, Mate Granic 
should arrive for talks in Belgrade, while one day later the 
offices of the F.R.Y. and Croatia would be opened in Zagreb and 
Belgrade, respectively. 
  F.R.Y. Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic stated, after 
the 
declaration on the normalization of relations was signed, that 
this document does not prejudice the question of the final 
status of the Republic of Serb Krajina (RSK). 
  The RSK was formed in 1991 in predominantly Serb-populated 
parts of Croatia in response to Croatia's forcible secession 
from ex- Yugoslavia and its attempt to reduce the status of 
Serbs to that of a national minority. In March, 1992, the RSK 
was declared "a United Nations Protected Area" (UNPA). It will 
maintain this status until the final relevant political solution 
is found.

  [Text] This morning's round of Croatian-Yugoslav talks at 
the level of deputy prime ministers has ended. Croatian Deputy 
Prime Minister Mate Granic, his guest, Yugoslav Deputy Prime 
Minister Zeljko Simic, and their associates met, it was 
announced, to review humanitarian issues and the possibilities 
for establishing communications links between the two 
neighboring but still mutually unrecognized countries. 
  After brief talks between the two delegations in their 
entirety, the meeting continued between the delegation heads and 
their closest aides, who discussed political issues. Working 
groups on humanitarian issues and communications links held 
separate meetings at the same time. 
  According to assessments made at the beginning of the talks, 
the purpose of today's meeting is to resolve problems over which 
there is a convergence of views between the two countries; 
however, open questions may arise, and the two sides should at 
least coordinate methods and dynamics for resolving them. 
  Croatian circles have noted that this morning's round of 
talks was held in a cooperative working atmosphere. This 
particularly applies, reporters were told, to the talks 
conducted by the mixed commissions for refugees, expelled, and 
missing persons. 
  Talks between the Yugoslav and Croatian deputy prime 
ministers and their associates will continue this afternoon.

  [Text] Knin, Feb 13 (TANJUG) -- Republic of Serb Krajina 
(R.S.K.) Foreign Minister Slobodan Jarcevic said on Sunday he 
was confident that Yugoslavia's leadership would not do anything 
to Krajina's disadvantage while negotiating with Croatia on the 
normalization of their relations. 
  The delegations of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and 
Croatia on Saturday had talks in Zagreb on the normalization of 
their relations, based on the declaration signed in Geneva 
mid-January. 
  Jarcevic reiterated that these talks had included a large 
number of issues, ranging from humanitarian to political issues, 
and underscored he held the view that Croatia was responsible 
for the exile of 300,000 Serbs, who did not in any way violate 
the laws of the new Croatian government. For that reason, 
Croatia should be 'put before the bar of justice,' Jarcevic said. 
  On the issue of the re-opening of communications, in 
particular the Zagreb-Belgrade motorway, Jarcevic repeated the 
already familiar conditions set by R.S.K. that had to be 
fulfilled first: peace must be established between R.S.K. and 
Croatia and Croatia must allow R.S.K. to establish foreign trade. 
  R.S.K. was proclaimed in 1991 in predominantly 
Serb-populated 
parts of Croatia in response to its forcible secession from 
former Yugoslavia and its attempt to reduce the constituent 
nation status of Serbs to that of a national minority. 
  R.S.K. has been the U.N. protected area (UNPA) since March 
1992 and, as planned, it will keep this status until a final 
political solution has been found. 
  After the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Croatia had 
signed the declaration on the normalization of their relations, 
Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic said that the 
declaration did not prejudge the issue of the R.S.K. final 
status.

  [Excerpt] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman tonight 
received in the presidential palace a delegation from the 
Republic of Croatia and a delegation from the Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia. They held talks on the normalization of 
Croatian-Serbian relations. The Croatian delegation was led by 
Mate Granic, deputy prime minister and minister for foreign 
affairs. Zeljko Simic led the delegation from the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia. 
  The two delegations told President Tudjman of the results of 
their talks, which can be regarded as the first successful step 
toward the normalization of relations. A joint commission for 
missing persons, refugees, and displaced persons, as well as 
other humanitarian issues, was created. Liaison offices in the 
capitals of both countries will be set up soon. President 
Tudjman pointed out the need for the normalization of relations 
between the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia as well as for mutual diplomatic recognition, which 
would create conditions for introducing good-neighborly 
relations and the opening up of possibilities for economic 
cooperation. 
  Despite everything that has taken place over the past few 
years, two countries that share a border cannot exist in a state 
of hostilities forever. Therefore, it is in the interest of 
both the Croatian and Serbian people that peace reigns in 
future, something that will gradually lead to the restoration of 
normal life. This is what we should aspire to by investing our 
every day efforts in this direction--sincerely and without 
second thoughts--President Tudjman said. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Croatian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign </F>
Minister Mate Granic by Dragoslav Kosaric; place and date not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Kosaric] Mr. Granic, what do you concretely 
expect from the talks with [FRY--Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] 
Deputy Prime Minister Simic in Zagreb [on 12 February]? 
  [Granic] We will discuss three groups of questions. First, 
the functioning of the Bureau of the Republic of Croatia in 
Belgrade, that is to say, of the FRY Bureau in Zagreb, and all 
the details connected to it. According to the information from 
both sides so far, they will be opened on time. 
  The other group of questions will comprise of humanitarian 
issues. The search for missing persons, the problem of 
refugees, and such like. I believe that the interest here is 
almost identical, completely identical on several of these 
issues, and that both sides must invest all efforts to [words 
indistinct] be resolved as soon as possible. We will also 
discuss these questions at the meeting of the two delegations. 
At the same time, as you know, we have formed a joint 
commission in the presence of the UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees [UNHCR] and the International Red Cross Committee. 
  The third group of questions are political, interstate 
issues. Some important technical questions regarding the opening 
of communications will definitely be included in these political 
issues, but also fundamental questions of the normalization of 
Serbian-Croatian relations. 
  [Kosaric] Dr. Zvonimir Markovic, chief of the future 
Croatian Bureau in Belgrade, recently spoke of five phases of 
the implementation of the Geneva declaration. How do you see 
the declaration within the context of Belgrade-Zagreb relations? 
  [Granic] It is perfectly obvious that not everything can be 
resolved with one or two meetings. The problems are too 
profound, and precisely for this reason it pays to be highly 
rational and serious in our approach to the resolution of 
problems. I believe that the opinion to resolve problems in 
phases is absolutely correct. For this reason, we have 
initiated the idea about certain degrees of priority and 
possibilities for resolution today. However, we will definitely 
raise all the essential political questions tomorrow. 
  [Kosaric] The Serbian side has insisted on direct 
Zagreb-Knin talks regarding the problem of the territories 
controlled by the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] from the very 
beginning. What is your view, that is, the view of the Republic 
of Croatia, toward this issue within the framework of the 
general normalization of relations? 
  [Granic] Well, Croatia accepts direct negotiations. We are 
compelled to this by UN Security Council Resolution 871. 
However, it is equally perfectly obvious that we must first 
accomplish a total cease-fire, the end of all hostilities, then 
restore communications, and afterward directly resolve all 
political issues. 
  I would like to reiterate that it is beyond any doubt that 
the stance that FRY will assume toward these regions will be 
very important. This is the key issue. The UN Security Council 
resolution also speaks of this. What is more important, the 
progress in our talks is possible only if we define these 
matters well, too. 
  [Kosaric] Tell me, what essential issues for Croatia should 
be examined as soon as possible? 
  [Granic] Regarding Croatia, as I have emphasized, it is 
important, first of all, that Belgrade's influence on the UN 
Protected Areas [UNPAs] be constructive. We understand that the 
resolution of the entire issue of UNPA zones is a process. I 
believe that we have reached a consensus on an all-encompassing 
cease-fire and the establishment of communications. However, 
afterward, Croatia will propose a concrete plan. What we expect 
from Belgrade is to find the final political solution for the 
UNPA zones as a part of the Republic of Croatia, according to 
all UN Security Council resolutions passed so far and, 
naturally, with all international guarantees. However, 
Belgrade's stance at any moment is the most important. 
  If Belgrade's stance regarding this is clear, then it is 
perfectly clear that Belgrade can expect similarly important 
political moves from us. We are ready for them. 
  [Kosaric] Will this year be crucial for overall 
Serbian-Croatian relations, in your view? 
  [Granic] I believe that this year will be very significant. 
We have stated very openly that for us it is imperative to 
resolve the fundamental question -- an end to clashes with the 
Muslims and the permanent regulation of relations. However, 
[word indistinct] of the relations in this part of Europe are 
the Serbian-Croatian relations. For the stability of the entire 
region, Serbian-Croatian relations are of the greatest 
importance. The permanent normalization of the Croatian-Serbian 
relations is practically a precondition for peace and stability 
in this part of Europe. This was also included in the CSCE 
documents and we firmly stand on this position. Naturally, we 
would like to see the permanent normalization of relations and, 
of course, permanent stability, and both counties will profit 
greatly in the long run. 
  [Kosaric] The restoration of telephone and transport 
communications is scheduled for the first phase. For the time 
being, neither the first nor the latter has been accomplished. 
When will the telephone communications be restored and is there 
another condition for their restoration? 
  [Granic] We will discuss this concretely tomorrow. I have 
previously told you what are the fundamental problems for the 
Republic of Croatia. If we resolve some basic political issues, 
then the restoration of telecommunications and, naturally, all 
other communications will develop very quickly, in which Croatia 
has a great interest. We do not expect everything to be 
resolved instantaneously. We do not expect this. However, we 
will raise all these issues tomorrow and we expect that they 
will be resolved in progress and to the mutual interest of both 
countries. 
  [Kosaric] Finally, on 15 March, you are supposed to travel 
to Belgrade to continue the talks. Does your departure depend 
on the success of the Zagreb round? 
  [Granic] I believe that my visit to Belgrade will take place 
some time around 15 March. Regarding the success of the Zagreb 
round, it is definite that progress will be reached regarding 
the opening of the Croatian and FRY bureaus. It is definite 
that we will make progress in the search for missing persons. 
However, what progress we will make on the political issues 
remains to be seen tomorrow. In any case, we would like to 
accomplish major moves. 
  [Kosaric] Dr. Granic, can we then realistically expect the 
opening of the FRY and Croatian bureaus in Zagreb and Belgrade 
on 15 March in accordance with the Geneva declaration? 
  [Granic] We can, and I believe that Croatia will open its 
bureau on 15 February. Just after our interview, we are having 
a meeting to pass the final decision, however, I can say that 
our side has completed all the preparations. On the other hand, 
both sides have, so far, fulfilled all their obligations and we 
expect that the opening will truly take place, perhaps even on 
15 February. 
  I would like to say another thing. You see, no question will 
be bypassed tomorrow. Naturally, we know very well that the 
major FRY problems are, for example, sanctions, succession, and 
other issues. We will definitely also touched upon the situation 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina and search for the final cease-fire, an 
end to the war, and a lasting peace. Therefore, it does not 
mean that we will find solutions to everything tomorrow. 
However, it is certain that we must discuss all problems 
openly, regardless of how much we differ on them, and try to 
draw closer. Of course, tomorrow will be the time and the day 
when we will put forward the proposals for final solutions to 
everything to one another. 
  [Kosaric] In the name of Radio Belgrade, Dr. Granic, thank 
you for the interview. 
  [Granic] My pleasure.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with FRY [Federal Republic of </F>
Yugoslavia] Deputy Prime Minister Zeljko Simic and Croatian 
Deputy Prime Minister Mate Granic by Zeljko Avramovic in Zagreb; 
date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Simic] We are clearly showing to the world that 
Yugoslav foreign political orientation is consistent in its 
efforts to realize its peacemaking intention, to make a great 
contribution to the stabilization of the entire territory of the 
former Yugoslavia, and, moreover, by normalizing relations with 
Croatia, to make the region of southeastern Europe stable and to 
bring back to it the properties that this region had in the not 
so distant past. These properties are -- let me remind your 
viewers and all those people who are following the work and 
visit of the Yugoslav delegation -- that it has been 
representing and I think that it will continue to represent a 
bridge between the two civilizations, a region without which 
modern world could not even be imagined. 
  However, if somebody claims -- I am therefore in a way 
already inviting critics of such a visit and its consequences -- 
that progress is very small, insignificant, or that it is 
(?benign), I would not agree with this, because such steps which 
pervade concrete lives show that life itself can often influence 
the creation of politics or can change politics in a certain 
way. It is not true that only politics can influence life and 
change it in this or the other way. 
  I think that the Croatian public, just as the public in 
Yugoslavia, is aware of the fact that the politics that is on 
the scene in Yugoslavia today is of such a kind that its only 
aim is to establish peace and to carry out policy devoid of any 
arrogance, arrogance which is, so to speak, alien to Yugoslav 
politics. 
  [Avramovic] Were the Serbian Krajinas, or, as the Croatian 
side puts it, the regions under UN protection, touched upon [in 
the talks]? 
  [Simic] It goes without saying that when I said that the 
most sensitive issues and the most difficult questions which in 
a way represent disturbing factors in the relations between the 
two countries were touched upon, that the problem of the 
krajinas could not be avoided in any way. However, I must say 
that both sides -- it is immodest to say so on behalf of my own 
delegation, but I think that the Croatian side will also confirm 
that -- have shown the good intention that any kind of extremism 
should be avoided in taking any stands. The Yugoslav side had a 
clear stand that the legitimate will of the Serbian people in 
the krajinas cannot be avoided and that it is the factor which 
we must take into account and will always take into account. 
  [Avramovic] Which of these conclusions, these agreements you 
consider to be the most significant? 
  [Granic] Well, I would say that the most important thing is 
that we have agreed that settling Croat-Serbian relations and 
the relations between the Republic of Croatia and the FRY is the 
foundation of the stability of the region and that all problems 
should be solved in [word indistinct]. In the concrete case, as 
regards the commission for the disappeared persons, refugees, 
and humanitarian issues, this is a great step forward. There 
are problems on both sides equally, and they can be solved only 
in such an atmosphere.

  [Excerpts] In light of some newspapers writing about the 
alleged replacement of U.S. Ambassador Alan Wendt [as heard], 
the Slovene Government, the U.S. Embassy, and the Defense 
Ministry have issued statements: 
  In its statement, the Slovene Government emphasizes that it 
has no knowledge of any replacements and that it favors 
strengthening good relations with Washington in all spheres. 
The hitherto good cooperation is, to a great extent, also a 
result of the work and efforts of the U.S. Embassy in Ljubljana. 
[passage omitted] 
  The claims of the U.S. Embassy were also supported by our 
Defense Ministry. A brief statement says that Lieutenant 
(Leach) has, from 3 November 1993, lead very successfully a 
liaison group within the Army to Army program, which is aimed at 
exchanging experiences in the military sphere. Claims that 
Lieutenant (Leach) has been recalled is insulting to Mr. Leach 
-- who has, in the meantime, become a great friend of our 
country -- and harms diplomatic efforts, the international 
reputation of Slovenia, and cooperation of our ministry with the 
U.S. Defense Ministry, the Defense Ministry statement says.

  [Text] This evening, the prime minister's cabinet reported 
that U.S. Ambassador Alan Wendt was received by Prime Minister 
Dr. Janez Drnovsek today. 
  The prime minister praised highly the accomplished level of 
cooperation in the political and economic spheres and at the 
same time informed Mr. Wendt that our government today explained 
its cooperation and contacts with the U.S. diplomatic mission in 
Ljubljana to the public. 
  Ambassador Wendt emphasized that a clear stance of the 
Slovene Government is very important for further strengthening 
of relations between the states and especially for the support 
of the United States for Slovenia's integration in international 
political and economic institutions.

  [Excerpts] A news conference was held in the government 
press center this morning, at which Defense Minister Janez Jansa 
spoke of the views of the Defense Ministry toward some current 
issues that are part of responsibility of the Defense Ministry. 
Robert Skerjanc reports: 
  [Begin Skerjanc recording] First Minister Jansa touched upon 
the question why Slovenia still has not joined the Partnership 
for Peace. As the main reason, he stated foot-dragging in 
parliament's acceptance of clear-cut decisions about drawing 
closer to NATO. 
  As the second issue, the minister touched upon yesterday's 
decision by NATO [regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina]. He assessed it 
as the first serious measure referring to the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, he warned here that the entire 
affair can turn into a failed attempt at sorting out the matters 
in this region or into a threat that the Serbs will, in time, 
skillfully water down. He also pointed at the need to protect 
the direct vicinity, because we can also expect some retaliation 
in case of international intervention. [passage omitted] 
  As a penultimate matter, the minister touched upon, as he 
said, the biggest international scandal, that is, articles in 
some papers that claimed that, because of the allegedly too-good 
relations with the Defense Ministry, the head of the U.S. 
liaison group, Lieutenant (Leach), and U.S. Ambassador Wendt had 
to leave Slovenia. He again warned that such writing is harmful 
for the international reputation of Slovenia as well as the 
cooperation of the Slovene Defense Ministry with the U.S. 
Defense Ministry. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] The press agency of the Slovak Republic has 
succeeded in obtaining a program statement by the signatories of 
the Alternative of Political Realism within the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. The signatories gave a briefing on 
their initiative to members and deputies of the ruling movement 
at today's session of the HZDS deputies' club in Casta 
Papiernicka. We quote: 
  Being aware of the fact that a confrontational policy does 
not guarantee Slovakia's further positive development and that 
it is necessary to concentrate the efforts and responsibilities 
of political forces toward overcoming problems Slovakia has been 
struggling against, taking into account the inevitability of a 
political reconciliation in the period preceeding early 
elections, we propose: 
  1. To form a government with the participation of the HZDS, 
the Party of the Democratic Left, the Christian Democratic 
Movement, the Slovak National Party, and the Alliance of 
Democrats--without personal participation of the chairmen of 
those parties and movements. 
  2. To invite experts without party affiliation to join the 
government. 
  We consider it inevitable to return to the movement's 
original democratic principles and to fulfill its liberal social 
program. 
  With the aim of following these aims, we have created the 
Alternative of Political Realism within the HZDS.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] A news conference on the new 
proposal of the alternative group in the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] was given today by one of the 
alternative group's 10 representatives, Deputy Peter Tomecek. 
  [Begin recording] [Tomecek] The alternative of political 
realism believes that a way out of this situation lies in the 
possibility of stabilizing the political state of affairs in 
Slovakia. This will lead to the creation of a government of 
reason [vlada z rozumu], a so-called wider coalition. Such a 
government would stabilize the situation in Slovakia until new 
elections, which should resolve the political situation in 
Slovakia. 
  Of course, we tried to discuss the point that, if we want 
political stability in Slovakia, it would probably not be 
feasible for top political representatives to enter such a 
government. We therefore propose that our [HZDS] 
representatives consider the possibility of having a government 
without top political representation. 
  The prime minister accepted the alternatives that had 
appeared in the press, the so-called four alternatives. On the 
basis of the manner in which our group presented this 
appeal--and, of course, because it also concerned him as 
chairman of the movement and as the top political 
representative--I think he will present his viewpoint at an 
extraordinary meeting on Saturday [12 February]. My personal 
opinion is that, if somebody holds different views, it does not 
mean that he will leave the movement just because his views are 
not accepted. 
  We have been building this movement a long time. We have 
certain obligations, not only social ones but, of course, also 
obligations toward this movement. Therefore, I do not suppose 
the movement will splinter as you have formulated it. 
  [Correspondent] Will you support the government bill on 
large-scale privatization? 
  [Tomecek] Of course, our group intends to support the 
government bill. [passage omitted] 
  [Second correspondent] What was the result of voting in the 
parliamentary club of the HZDS on the resignation of the two 
deputy chairmen? 
  [Tomecek] Regrettably, I can announce that the resignations 
of Vladimir Bajan and of Marian Kelemen were accepted. [passage 
omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] Martin Bartisek asked Vladimir Meciar, Movement for 
Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] chairman and prime minister, late 
this morning to assess the situation brought about by 
yesterday's publication of an alternative proposal by the 
deputies and HZDS members. 
  [Bartisek] Ten members of the HZDS club of deputies to the 
Slovakian National Council see a certain new solution to the 
current crisis in an option to create a government of reason, a 
so-called government of broad coalition. Mr. Prime Minister, 
people from the HZDS, the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], 
the Christian Democratic Party [KDH], the Slovak National Party 
[SNS], and the Alliance of Democrats are being considered for 
this--however, without leading figures of those parties. 
  You will give your view on participating in the government 
only following tomorrow's session of the HZDS caucus. 
Nevertheless, could you give us your view now on this proposal? 
  [Meciar] There are two matters here. One concerns the 
content of the proposal, and the other one is the way it came 
about. 
  At yesterday's session, under the weight of evidence, Mr. 
Roman Kovac and Jozef Moravcik finally admitted that, without 
the knowledge of the Movement's political bodies, without the 
knowledge of the government members, they had held talks with 
opposition political parties about a different alternative 
solution. 
  As they were not strong enough, they attempted to gain 
support within the HZDS club, and, so far, they have been joined 
by 10 deputies. This does not mean that all those 10 deputies 
would vote against the government during a vote of no-confidence 
in the government. Some of them would, and some would not. 
  The way they acted contradicts the principles of democracy, 
it contradicts the HZDS's principles. It is immoral because, 
during talks, they looked their colleagues straight in the eye, 
pretending to be friends, and, in fact, they were working for 
the fall of this government. They must assume political 
responsibility for this. 
  The proposal itself assumes the following solution. The 
first part is to remove political heads from the leadership. 
This means the political heads of the HZDS and the SNS. 
Logically, those others are not in the government. And we are 
in the government not illegitimately but on the basis of 
election results. 
  The second part is the formation of such a broad coalition. 
What will be keeping them together besides material interests? 
Nothing. This does not have any chance of surviving. Some 
assume that elections might take place in a year's time--it is 
not to be expected [passage indistinct]. They would settle 
their personal, material, and group interests and then would 
hand over the ransacked state to those who win the elections. 
  Third, it is the matter for the HZDS bodies to decide 
whether 
such a coalition would be viable. All its district congresses, 
with the exception of one--and that was more a technical 
matter--expressed their support for the government. This means 
that, if deputies are taking such a stance, they are acting 
against the resolutions of their district congresses, which are 
binding for them. There is yet another factor here: The HZDS 
did not express its interest in participating in any such 
government. My personal view is not to participate in such a 
government, not to participate in something that is being 
prepared under the pretext of the government's reconstruction if 
we want to have clean hands for the next elections. 
  [Bartisek] The Party of the Democratic Left admits the 
possibility of a broad coalition. However, this has to be 
discussed by the political entities concerned. We have learned 
that, following your departure from Papiernicka [where HZDS 
deputies held session] yesterday, you held a telephone 
conversation with Mr. Weiss [SDL chairman], above all about the 
amendment of the privatization law. However, a proposal was also 
voiced about taking a vote of confidence in the government at 
the same time. What is the reason for such a link? 
  [Meciar] This involves several things. First, this concerns 
system measures in the sphere of privatization that are to be 
implemented. Second, all of the opposition parties insist that 
we do not enjoy support in the parliament. They criticize the 
government and deprive the government of tools to carry out 
economic policy. This is like someone giving you a job but 
keeping the purse in his hands. This is nonsense. The 
government is expected to take responsibility, but the tools of 
responsibility are held by someone else. So, if they want to 
cripple the government economically to prevent government 
activities, let them to do it immediately. If the government 
enjoys confidence, they should not deprive the government of 
tools it can use in the sphere of politics. 
  Regarding the linking of confidence in the government to the 
adoption of the law on privatization, no final decision on this 
matter has been made so far--roughly 50 percent are in favor and 
50 percent against. Let us wait until tomorrow to see the 
decision made by the HZDS leadership.

  [Text] Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar indicated that 
he would strive for the dismissal of Deputy Prime Minister Roman 
Kovac and Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik. He did not rule out 
that he would link the voting on the privatization bill to the 
vote of confidence in the government. Kovac and Moravcik, who 
head the alternative platform within the ruling Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], proposed to form a new government in 
which opposition parties would also participate. However, it 
would be a government without Meciar. The prime minister also 
claimed that, of the 10 HZDS deputies who joined the Alternative 
of Political Realism, not all of them would vote for voicing no 
confidence in his government. 
  Speaking about the Alternative's proposal regarding a broad 
coalition government without political leaders, he remarked that 
the real purpose of this was to remove political leaders from 
the government coalition between the HZDS and the Slovak 
National Party. Meciar said that a broad coalition would not 
last because the parties would be bound together only by 
material interest.

  [Text] [Announcer] Following the debacle at the 
extraordinary meeting of the republican leadership of the 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] on Saturday [12 
February], journalists were addressed in Bratislava today by 
Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac, Foreign Minister Jozef 
Moravcik, and HZDS deputy Vladimir Bajan. Our correspondent 
Renata Havranova, editor of the daily PRACE, reports. 
  [Havranova] Both Kovac and Moravcik rejected Meciar's 
accusation of cowardice and an attempt to break up the HZDS 
behind his back. The prime minister's claim that they betrayed 
him by assuring him of their loyalty before bringing in the 
Alternative of Political Realism is untrue. 
  On the contrary, Kovac stressed that he spent three and a 
half hours explaining to Meciar where the causes for the 
differing views rested. Moravcik added that loyalty is 
irrelevant in the process of solving a serious political crisis. 
Both of them rejected the possibility of resigning and said 
that their resignation would amount to admitting mistakes. But 
they naturally reckon that they will be dismissed. 
  They said that the proposal that they should be expelled 
from 
the HZDS was a poor indication of the democracy existing in the 
movement, which meant to represent the freedom of thought. The 
verdict that they breached the [HZDS] charter is also 
unsubstantiated. They did not organize the Alternative as a 
faction because the charter bans factions. Deputy Bajan said 
that, in order to determine what the next action in parliament 
will be, he would have to establish what was happening to the 
deputies who support the Alternative before and after the 
leadership meeting. What he probably meant were the 
so-far-unconfirmed reports that some of them--for example, 
Deputies [Martin] Zingor and [Anna] Draxlerova--were even 
threatened with physical violence. 
  Speaking about the government of broad coalition without top 
political leaders, they said that, no matter how absurd this 
idea appeared to be, the opposition accepted it and that this 
trend would continue in Slovakia. The government posts should 
be filled with real pragmatists, even unaffiliated ones, capable 
of bringing stability to Slovakia. All of them said that early 
elections were the best possible solution to the situation that 
has arisen. The solution they proposed has only speeded up the 
whole process of sorting out the problems in society. According 
to Kovac and Moravcik, expectations that the government might be 
dismissed as early as 16 February, at the parliament's session, 
appear to be unrealistic for the time being.

  [Text] In a secret vote at Modra yesterday, the republican 
leadership of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] 
expressed no confidence in Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac and 
Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik and rejected the Alternative of 
Political Realism. The HZDS political executive will make a 
decision on early elections and will also assess the possibility 
of initiating a referendum. 
  After the meeting, Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar stated 
that 
Kovac and Moravcik were nominated to their government posts by 
the HZDS, and, if their aim is to cause the movement's 
disintegration, they should have the courage to leave 
voluntarily. At the moment, he is not considering proposing 
their removal to the president but will wait to see what they 
are going to do. 
  According to Meciar, the HZDS is monolithic, functional, and 
capable of fighting on. In his opinion, the image presented by 
the signatories of the alternative is leading to destruction. 
The prime minister also rejected the idea of a government of 
wider coalition and stated that it could only become the 
government of wider corruption. His government does not intend 
to resign, and, if the opposition parties are thinking of 
expressing no confidence in the government or in the prime 
minister, they will have to be prepared for what will follow, 
Meciar said. In his view, the current political crisis in 
Slovakia is not real but has been provoked artificially by 
political parties fighting for power in the privatization 
process. 
  In an interview with a reporter for the Slovak press agency 
[TASR], Jozef Moravcik said that, while he can, he will try to 
put across the views held by the Alternative for Political 
Realism within the HZDS. If the signatories of the alternative 
have their party membership withdrawn, then, according to 
Moravcik, they will have to continue their political work 
outside the movement. 
  Roman Kovac told TASR that he does not intend to resign his 
position of deputy prime minister.

<F P=106> [Report by Sanja Eric from Pale] </F>
  [Text] On the occasion of the agreed cease-fire and the 
withdrawal of artillery from around Sarajevo, General Manojlo 
Milovanovic, member of the general staff of the army of the 
Srpska republic, and General Milan Gvero, deputy commander of 
the general staff of the army of the Srpska republic, met the 
representatives of UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Forces], 
General (Magnus) Ramsey, head of the UNPROFOR staff for the 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina, and General Andre Soubirou, head of 
the UNPROFOR sector for Sarajevo, in Pale today. 
  After the meeting, Gen. Manojlo Milovanovic said that 
progress has been achieved in the talks because despite all that 
is happening, the 24th truce has still been lasting the longest. 
Gen. Milovanovic said that the Serbian side has imposed the 
condition that there will be no grouping and pulling out of the 
artillery, which means that artillery will remain where it is 
and UNPROFOR is obligated to ensure control of the cease-fire. 
Members of the UNPROFOR have accepted this condition because no 
document, including the one adopted by NATO, speaks about a 
definite [kategorican] withdrawal of weapons, but only about 
putting them under UNPROFOR control. 
  By the way, Muslim forces have continued violating the 
agreed 
cease-fire on the Sarajevo battlefield. On the Vogosca section 
of the front, they are opening mortar and infantry fire on the 
Serbian defense lines around the Traffic Faculty. The 
cease-fire does not apply to Muslim snipers who are shooting 
from their strongholds at all sections of Serbian Sarajevo. So 
far there have been no reports of casualties.

  [Text] Kragujevac, 13 Feb (TANJUG) -- "If we were to accept 
the unreasonable demand that only our artillery be removed -- by 
20 km from our positions on the Sarajevo front line -- that 
would mean that we have abandoned our territory and left the 
Serb population with no protection and at the mercy of 50,000 
poisonously religious fanatics and anti-Serb Muslim fighters," 
General Milan Gvero, deputy chief of the general staff of the 
army of the Srpska republic, said today in the "Hallmark of the 
Times" program on Kragujevac radio. 
  Saying that no one in his right mind could accept this 
either 
in a military or a human sense, Gvero stressed that immediately 
after the withdrawal Muslim forces would take the Serb 
positions. This is why he has demanded a sensible agreement in 
the direction of peace. 
  "We must have guarantees that, if our army withdraws by a 
single kilometer, the Muslim army will do the same and that 
their infantry will not advance by a single inch. If there are 
no such guarantees we are dutybound to remain where we are now, 
because of the bloodshed and the people," Gvero added. In his 
words, there is a false image in the world of Sarajevo as a 
Muslim city. This is a territory which is Serbian in every 
respect, so the term siege is inappropriate and at odds with the 
facts. 
  The demand to tilt the balance of force to the detriment of 
Serb forces is unrealistic and unfulfillable. In Gvero's view, 
this is a criminal attitude to our territory, our people, and 
our army. 
  General Gvero stressed that NATO's ultimatum was a 
consequence of the emotions created by the Sarajevo massacre, 
and it is a fact that the massacre was staged. 
  Asked to comment on President Clinton's statement that one 
should not fear the Bosnian Serbs' air defense, which is 
allegedly totally outdated and in poor repair, Gen. Gvero said: 
"If someone attacks us for no reason whatever we will, just as 
always in the past, find a way to neutralize the attacker. No 
one should speculate as to what weaponry we possess. We have 
enough weapons for effective defense. I believe that reason will 
prevail, but if insanity prevails it will be met with an 
appropriate reaction."

  [Text] Zagreb, Feb 13 (AFP) -- The UN secretary-general's 
special envoy met with commanders of the UN Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) and NATO's Southern Command here Sunday [13 February] 
to discuss possible air strikes on Bosnian Serb forces besieging 
Sarajevo. 
  The meeting, which came a week ahead of the Febuary 21 
deadline set by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for the 
Serbs to pull back their heavy guns, grouped Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali's special representative Yasushi Akashi, the 
UNPROFOR commanders for ex-Yugoslavia and Bosnia -- Generals 
Jean Cot and Michael Rose -- and Admiral Jeremy Boorda, 
commander of NATO's Southern Command. 
  Akashi told reporters afterwards that the meeting "was to 
make sure that UN and NATO work in concert with each other. It 
was fruitful. It seems that we think in the same way." 
  The talks, held at UNPROFOR's logistics base at Zagreb 
airport, marked the third time since Tuesday that General Cot 
and Admiral Boorda had met here to discuss possible NATO air 
action against Serb positions around the Bosnian capital. 
  "This meeting is very important to the success of our mutual 
endeavour," said Boorda's spokesman Captain Jim Mitchell. He 
added that the talks aimed to define "whose the responsibilities 
are" on "both sides of this team."

  [Excerpt] Sarajevo, Feb 10 (AFP) -- UN troops deployed 
Thursday [10 February] at six strategic points around the 
Bosnian capital to enforce the latest UN-brokered ceasefire 
agreement, as Bosnia Serbs warned they would retaliate against 
NATO airstrikes. 
  The UN Protection Force stepped up its presence in the city, 
while spokesman Colonel Richard Pernod said the UN troops had 
been ordered to riposte if attacked. 
  Bosnia's Serbs on Thursday rejected the North Atlantic 
Treaty 
Organisation's ultimatum to end their siege of Sarajevo or face 
air strikes, and said their heavy weapons would not be removed 
from around the city. 
  "Despite this ultimatum, the Serb artillery will not move an 
inch," said their main spokesman, Miroslav Toholj. "We are ready 
to retaliate." 
  And in what appeared to be an early Serb reaction to the 
NATO 
deadline, Toholj confirmed the Serbs were preventing UN refugee 
workers from following UN orders and leaving Serb-controlled 
zones. 
  "This decision was taken on the orders of the deputy 
commander-in-chief of the Serb army," General Milan Gvero, he 
said. 
  However, the UNHCR denied its staff were being held hostage. 
"We are having problems at the checkpoints but they are not 
hostages," said spokesman Kris Janowski here. 
  The aid agency Wednesday [9 February] recalled to Zagreb or 
Belgrade two thirds of its staff stationed in Serb-held areas of 
Bosnia. "The reason for this recall is next week's visit here of 
the High Commissioner and overall tense situation," he said. 
  Toholj described Wednesday's threat by NATO to hit Serb 
positions with air strikes if the artillery is not pulled back 
within 10 days as "a terrorist threat," adding that the Serbs 
would respond "by all means" to any attack. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, Feb 13 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb and 
government forces surrendered fresh batches of heavy weapons to 
UN troops Sunday as a ceasefire around the city entered its 
fourth day with only minor violations, UN spokesmen said. 
  UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] spokesman Major Bill Aikman 
told a press conference late Sunday (13 February] that 13 Serb 
and five Bosnian Army weapons had been handed over to UNPROFOR 
during the day after a 24-hour break in the disarmament process. 
  The Serbs handed over two 100 mm cannon, two 155 mm cannon, 
a 
122 mm mortar, six 82 mm mortars and two multiple 
rocket-launchers, Aikman said. 
  The mainly-Moslem Bosnian army for its part dismantled and 
placed under UN control a 75 mm anti-aircraft gun, two others of 
75 and 37 mm, and two 82 mm mortars. [passage omitted] 
  The ceasefire entered its fourth day midday Sunday with only 
a "small number of violations," Aikman said, adding 15 shells 
were fired in the city in the last 24 hours. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile in Zagreb Yasushi Akashi, UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali's special representative in Bosnia, stressed 
the air strike threat applied to all three of Bosnia's warring 
parties. 
  Speaking after meeting Sunday with UN and NATO commanders to 
coordinate possible implementation of air strikes, Akashi said 
that, in the event of bombardments being ordered, NATO would 
carry them out "against whichever party was violating the 
ceasefire." 
  UNPROFOR's Bosnia commander General Sir Michael Rose, who 
attended the meeting, added that many of the truce violations 
registered in Sarajevo had been carried out by Bosnian 
government troops. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Helene Despic-Popovic] </F>
  [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 12 (AFP) -- UN commander General 
Michael Rose ordered major peacekeeping reinforcements deployed 
here Saturday [12 February] to help implement a ceasefire accord 
calling for the immediate surrender of heavy weapons to UN 
control. 
  A UN Protetion Force [UNPROFOR] spokesman said Rose had 
called for a battalion of Malaysian UN troops to be deployed in 
the capital to help with the operation, which must be completed 
within a 10-day NATO deadline ending on February 21. 
  "General Rose has directed the Malaysian battalion which... 
arrived about a month ago or so to come here later today to 
assist interposition of UN troups between the two sides," he 
said. "They will be coming in significant number." 
  The Malaysian battalion, comprising up to 1,000 troops, 
arrived in the region about a month ago. Part of it has already 
been deployed in the region of Jablanica-Konjic, in southeastern 
Bosnia. 
  The order came on the second day of a ceasefire agreed 
Wednesday between Bosnian Moslems and Serbs, and in the context 
of a NATO ultimatum to launch air strikes if they do not 
demilitarize the city by midnight on February 20. 
  The truce itself was apparently holding Saturday, with no 
reports of fighting in Bosnia overnight. The NATO ultimatum 
allows for air strikes if the truce is violated in Sarajevo 
itself, a UN-designated safe area. 
  During the first day of implementation of the ceasefire 
Friday, Bosnian Serbs surrendered 13 artillery pieces or 
mortars, while Bosnian Moslem forces handed over five mortars, 
according to UN officials. 
  The quantity of weapons was insignificant given the 
firepower 
both sides possess in and around the city, but peacekeepers said 
the handover was of great symbolic importance. 
  At the end of the day Friday Rose said that "We've been 
moving troops into positions between the (front) lines and we've 
been accepting weapons under our control, into barracks on both 
sides." 
  The threat of air strikes, which could be triggered before 
the 10-day deadline by a breach of the ceasefire in Sarajevo, 
was boosted Friday by the U.S. decision to send eight F-15E 
bombers to Italy to increase the NATO force. 
  The planes, increasing the number of NATO aircraft in the 
region from 120 to 146, will be part of an improved fighter 
squadron being put together by Admiral Michael Boorda, NATO 
regional commander in charge of the Bosnia operation. 
  Many of the same type of aircraft had been in the region 
several months ago when the NATO allies appeared to be getting 
ready to launch air strikes. 
  Pilots at NATO bases in Italy, already being used as the 
base 
for Operation Deny Flight to prevent unauthorized air activity 
over Bosnia, say they are ready to implement the threat of 
strikes whenever necessary. 
  "The decision is a political one. We are here to carry out 
UN orders," said Doug Yurovich, 37, at the Italian NATO base of 
Aviano. "From up there you can see the Serb positions clearly. 
We would have no problem in hitting the targets, once they are 
designated," he said. 
  The developments came as peace talks between Bosnia's 
warring 
parties in Geneva were adjourned until after the NATO deadline 
with no progress reported. 
  E.C. mediator Lord Owen said earlier Saturday in Geneva that 
a new U.S. diplomatic initiative in favor of the Moslem-led 
Bosnian government and the NATO ultimatum were encouraging the 
Moslems to hold out in the negotiations to see if Western forces 
would intervene militarily around Sarajevo. 
  "Certainly they don't want to talk about the details of UN 
administration (of Sarajevo) for the moment until they see what 
happens. Probably the NATO deadline has to pass," he said.

  [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 14 (AFP) -- The mainly Moslem Bosnian 
army is taking advantage of the ceasefire in Sarajevo to 
reinforce its positions along several fronts around the capital, 
UNPROFOR spokesman Bill Aikman said Monday. 
  "Bosnian infantry units are expanding and advancing their 
trench system in Zuc and Mojmilo," two regions that overlook the 
capital, Aikman said. "They're improving their defense 
positions. It's a violation of the ceasefire." 
  The ceasefire went into effect last Thursday and was 
prompted 
by a mortar attack on a Sarajevo market that left 68 people dead 
and 197 injured. 
  The attack also prompted the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organisation to issue an ultimatum giving Bosnian Serbs 
besieging Sarajevo until February 21 to surrender their heavy 
weapons or face air strikes. The Bosnian army also must abide by 
the ultimatum. 
  The weapons handover, which began Friday, has been 
proceeding 
at a snail's pace with each side handing in only a few pieces of 
artillery. 
  Aikman said the Serbs surrendered two mortars Sunday 
evening, 
bringing to 28 the total number of mortars and heavy artillery 
they have handed in since Friday. The weapons are under UN 
custody. 
  The Bosnian army, for its part, has so far handed in 10 
mortars, Aikman said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic by an </F>
unidentified reporter; place and date not given: "Just Like 
Before the Gulf War"] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Does the NATO threat against the 
Serbs give the Muslims new courage? 
  [Ganic] If the Serbs have not withdrawn their artillery by 
21 February, NATO must bomb them. Otherwise, there will no 
longer be any NATO. The decision is clear: The ultimatum will 
not be extended, the only alternatives are withdrawal or attack. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The order to the planes to attack must still 
be given by UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali. 
  [Ganic] NATO has imposed the ultimatum so as to act and not 
to wriggle out of its responsibility again with administrative 
excuses. Formally, Butrus-Ghali decides on the operation -- in 
reality, Clinton and Mitterrand give the orders. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Are the attacks designed to give the 
inhabitants of Sarajevo some breathing space, or is the 
intention to end the war in Bosnia, if necessary by militarily 
defeating the Serbs? 
  [Ganic] A soon as Sarajevo is liberated, the Serbs will 
immediately show readiness for compromise. The psychological 
effect will be thorough. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] However, the Serbs could give up Sarajevo and, 
in retaliation, destroy Tuzla, Gorazde, or other Bosnian towns. 
  [Ganic] They will do this only if NATO hesitates and once 
again demonstrates leniency. So far, throughout this war, the 
West has not yet done anything specific. However, the Serbs 
cannot be impressed with appeals and resolutions. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Serbian leader Karadzic does not seem to be 
very intimidated. He is threatening retaliatory strikes. 
  [Ganic] This is simply ridiculous. The Serbs are only a 
small regional power, but before any potential intervention 
there are Western critics who conjure up the danger of a world 
war -- this is the same situation as before the Gulf war against 
Iraq. The UN blue helmets in Bosnia spend 90 percent of their 
time barricading and entrenching themselves, even though the 
Serbs are cowards, are strong only with artillery. There is no 
reason to fear them. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Can Serbian superiority be broken without the 
use of ground forces? 
  [Ganic] I guarantee that Milosevic will not wage war against 
NATO. He will never risk the bombing of Serbia. He will also 
call his puppets in Bosnia, such as Karadzic, back in time. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Does a NATO intervention bring peace closer, 
or does it just lengthen the war? Hoping for Western help, your 
President Izetbegovic has so far rejected any compromise at the 
negotiating table in Geneva. 
  [Ganic] Why should we share our house with thieves? We do 
not have the authority to relinquish any land to the Serbs. It 
is the property of our people, who have been driven away. Are 
our fellow-citizens supposed to vegetate as refugees in Germany 
or Austria instead of returning to their homes? According to 
the ethnic map, 45 percent of Bosnia belongs to the Muslim 
population. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] In Geneva you are offered about one-third of 
the state territory. Are you not succumbing to an illusion if 
you hope to receive more? 
  [Ganic] Germany has been united, Israel is negotiating with 
the Palestinians about the return of the occupied territories. 
Peace without clearing out of conquered territories is 
inconceivable. If the Serbs do not withdraw, there will be 
chaos in Bosnia for a long time. Europe is constantly calling 
on us to end the war and does not understand that our giving in 
would just end the first stage of the war. If Bosnia is divided 
into three parts, the Serbian Republic will continue to attack 
the Bosnian Republic. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Can you actually survive as a nation in the 
Serbian-Croatian embrace? What kind of Bosnia do you want to 
push through at the Geneva negotiations? 
  [Ganic] A sovereign state, which may be structured in 
autonomous areas, but with a central parliament and a central 
government. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Your government had already agreed on the 
principle of a tripartite division.... 
  [Ganic] ...the temptation to resign oneself to a small piece 
of land, if this could ensure that one never had to see Chetniks 
again, naturally existed. However, now we have to strengthen 
our resistance so as to decisively weaken the Serbs. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] What happens if the ultimatum passes and the 
Serbs only pretend to give in just to attack with all the more 
force a few weeks later? 
  [Ganic] If NATO gambles away its opportunity, the war will 
spread. We will begin a guerrilla war and stake everything on 
one card. Perhaps the Turkish Army will then help us. The 
Islamic countries have frequently offered us their support.

  [Excerpt] Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic 
and Assembly President Miro Lazovic held a news conference today 
upon their return from Geneva. 
  The Geneva negotiations and the withdrawal of the 
aggressor's 
artillery from around Sarajevo were the main focus. We have 
just received Mladen Bosnjak's report: 
  [Begin recording] [Bosnjak] Mr. Silajdzic, what were the 
results of your talks with [Croatian Foreign Minister Mate] 
Granic? Mr. Lazovic, how was the proposal on the three-way or 
four- way organization of the authorities and territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina--made by the Bosnian Croat 
convention--received in Geneva? 
  [Silajdzic] I think we held four meetings with Mr. Granic. 
We agreed, first, that military commanders should meet and try 
to put into effect a total cease-fire. We also agreed that both 
sides completely supported a project entitled All Return Home. 
That means creating conditions for everyone to return home, for 
everyone who has been expelled to be able to go back home. I 
think that we owe such an approach to our era and to this 
civilization. I am pleased that the Croatian delegation 
accepted such an approach. 
  We also agreed that the talks should be intensified and 
should resume. 
  [Lazovic] I can say the proposal by the Bosnian Croat 
convention--which had been accepted by the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Assembly--was received with real interest in Geneva. 
  That was the first time that Bosnian Croats appeared before 
the international public with a policy completely different from 
that of Zagreb. The delegation of the Bosnian Croat convention 
clearly said at a news conference that they represented 
two-thirds of the Bosnian Croats and that they denied the right 
of legitimacy to Akmadzic and others who are really entitled 
only to represent western Herzegovina. 
  This is a complete novelty in the policy of the Bosnian 
Croats. I am convinced that the official policy of the Republic 
of Croatia will have to take this into consideration in the 
upcoming period. It is interesting that even the representatives 
of the so-called Srpska republic listened to the proposal with a 
certain degree of interest. If the activities of the Bosnian 
Croats achieve satisfactory results in the coming period, 
particularly in the international arena, I believe that a change 
could be brought about that is favorable to the overall 
Bosnia-Herzegovina policy. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] Karadzic's deadline for his butchers to enter Bihac 
-- to capture the right bank of the Una River, that is -- runs 
out today at noon. That is why his bloodthirsty butchers spent 
the entire night charging and attacking at all the defense 
lines. They attacked the Grmusko-Srbljanski Plateau, Hasin Vrh, 
Grabez. In many of these places hand-to-hand fighting 
continues. Bad weather conditions are not deterring the Chetnik 
artillery from further destroying civilian buildings, destroying 
Bihac, [word indistinct], suburban districts, and Cazin. 
  [Words indistinct] that Fikret Abdic yesterday sent to 
Tudjman, Karadzic, Milosevic, Boban, and his other superiors, to 
urgently help his so-called army defend itself against the 5th 
Corps. Obviously, (?he too) fears the growing awareness of the 
people of Velika Kladusa. 
  This has been Mirza Sadikovic reporting for Radio Television 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item; by Dejan Lukic] </F>
  [Text] Washington, February 13 (TANJUG) -- Since the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) sent an ultimatum to Bosnian 
Serbs that they would be bombed unless they withdrew their heavy 
weapons to a distance of 20 km from the center of Sarajevo by 
February 21, media in the United States have been showing their 
own and the world public every possible way in which every 
possible piece of ammunition will inevitably drop on the heads 
of Bosnian Serbs. 
  For a full three years since the Gulf war, American media, 
spearheaded by the CNN, have never had a better chance to 
promote in such an aggressive manner the power of American 
weaponry and such accompanying arrogance that can hardly be 
attributed to a civilized country. 
  According to American media, the planes of Admiral Burda, 
who 
is in charge of the operation in Bosnia, revved up their engines 
already on Friday evening because some shells exploded in 
Sarajevo. It was later established, however, that there were 
about fifty of them and that most of them were Moslem. 
  The American public was immediately informed from NATO's 
southern command in Naples that a special group in charge of 
picking potential Serb targets had specified several hundred of 
them, from individual artillery pieces to warehouses of fuel and 
munitions. 
  In the war of nerves which was launched by the U.S. 
Administration and taken up with clockwork precision by the 
American media, the information was released immediately that 
the turning on of the engines of Admiral Burda was, 
unfortunately, a false alarm. The action was nevertheless 
welcome, the media emphasized, because it had enabled all 
services and commands to be put into operation as in an actual 
situation. 
  Admiral Burda has 146 planes at his disposal. In the 
escalation of military combinations and war cries, he 
immediately asked for an additional eight "super" planes, 
cheered on by CNN and company, which would be able to strike by 
day or by night, in rain or fog, from high or low altitudes. 
  Eight F-15s were immediately flown from bases in Great 
Britain to airports in Italy. 
  CNN hurried to show until now unusual "secret" CIA shots 
showing, as the reporter explained, the helpless appearance of 
Bosnian Serb positions around Sarajevo, filmed with optical 
instruments of U.S. planes. Everything has been filmed, 
pinpointed, nothing can be hidden, in the daytime or at night, 
and now all that is expected is the signal to begin. 
  One of the "commanders" of the CNN is already in the 
Adriatic 
on the aircraft carrier The Saratoga. Everything is in 
readiness here, engines are roaring, missiles have been attached 
under the wings of the planes, only Butrus Butrus-Ghali seems to 
be hesitating still, and the Russians are ignored anyway.

  [Text] Zagreb, Feb 9 (TANJUG) -- The parliament of the 
Bosnian Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna has decided that the 
former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina should be a union 
of three constituent nations enjoying the same rights. 
  The Bosnian Croats' constitutional rights and right of 
self-determination can be exercised through the Bosnian Croat 
Republic of Herceg-Bosna in a union of three republics of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, provided that the right is observed of the 
other two constituent nations, Bosnian Moslems and Serbs, to 
have their own republics based on the same principles -- says a 
declaration adopted by 400 participants in the parliament 
session of the Bosnian Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna late on 
Tuesday. 
  According to this document, Mostar, the largest town in the 
Herzegovina region and its administrative centre, in which 
pitched battles are being fought between Bosnian Croat and 
Bosnian Moslem troops, is to be the capital of the Bosnian Croat 
Republic of Herceg-Bosna and 'an indivisible urban entity.' 
  The participants in the parliament session held in Livno, a 
town in western Herzegovina, have supported Franjo Tudjman's 
policy i.e. his 'peace initiative,' in particular the agreement 
on the normalization of relations between Croatia and the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia signed within the international 
conference on the former Yugoslavia in Geneva last month.

  [Text] Jagodina, Feb 9 (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, the 
speaker of the parliament of the Bosnian Serb Republic (RS), 
said on Wednesday that the Serb side is the most interested that 
an agreement on the normalization of the situation in Sarajevo 
is reached in Geneva on Thursday, because the Moslems are 
holding 60,000 Serbs as hostages there. 
  "Sarajevo is the biggest detention camp in which the Serbs 
have been held since the start of the war. This is why it is 
illogical to claim that the Serbs have encircled Sarajevo, and 
even more illogical that they do not want a negotiated solution 
for this Serb city," Krajisnik told local Radio Jagodina 
(central Serbia). 
  He reiterrated that in Geneva RS is willing to discuss the 
demilitarization of Sarajevo and the putting of this 
multi-ethnic capital of the former Yugoslav republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina under U.N. control. 
  "Tomorrow in Geneva the Serb side will clearly state its 
conditions for pulling out its heavy weapons," Krajisnik said 
and explained that this is necessary because the Moslems also 
have the same type of arms. 
  "If the Moslem weapons remain at the line of fire, and ours 
are put out of action, then it is clear that the international 
community's demand is to enable the Moslems to take the Serb 
territories in this part of the front," Krajisnik said. The 
Serbs will never allow this, he concluded.

  [Text] Zvornik, Feb 9 (TANJUG) -- The Moslem authorities in 
Tuzla, a former major chemical industry centre in northeast 
Bosnia, have over the past few days intentionally prevented the 
distribution of international relief aid to the civilian 
population aiming to cause mass discontent among their own 
people, TANJUG learned on Wednesday. 
  According to well-informed sources in the Bosnian Serb 
Republic (RS), this discontent is used as an argument in the 
efforts to open up the former military airport in Tuzla on the 
pretext that this would step up humanitarian aid. 
  However, official RS sources confirm that there is enough 
food because all international aid for Tuzla passes through 
Zvornik, a town near the border with the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia. 
  In the past ten days only, 13 convoys (a total of 172 
trucks) 
of the U.N. High Commissariat for Refugees (UNHCR) and the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) brought 1,400 
tonnes of food and medications and 1,200 litres of engine oil 
and fuel to Tuzla via Serb-held territory. 
  However, the bulk of this aid is siezed by the Bosnian 
Moslem 
army, never arriving in the hands of the tens of thousands of 
Tuzla's children, women, the ill and elderly, the Bosnian Serbs 
said.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav </F>
Jovanovic by Richard Schneider in Belgrade; date not given: 
"Solution for Bosnia Through Geneva, Not Through Bombs"] 
  [Text] [Schneider] Foreign Minister, the call of the world 
public for military intervention against the Bosnian Serbs has 
become louder than ever. Are you alarmed by that? 
  [Jovanovic] It is not new that the question of military 
intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina has been made topical. For a 
long time, it has been part of a tested strategy in the policies 
of several Western countries. A strategy that aims at putting 
psychological and political pressure on the Serbs in Bosnia, 
while the need for some of these countries to offer their 
services to the Islamic bloc, in order to achieve a balance in 
their relations, is another element of this course of action. 
At any rate, the wish for such intervention is absurd because 
at present neither a basis nor a justification for it exists, 
all the more so since in this civil war it is precisely the 
Serbs who have had to defend themselves constantly against 
attacks from the Muslim side for a relatively long time. 
  [Schneider] Do you not think that this sounds somewhat 
cynical after the horrible massacre in Sarajevo last Saturday? 
  [Jovanovic] Only if the blame can be laid on the Serbs by an 
objective side. But this is not the case here, which was also 
confirmed by British UN General Richie after he had had a close 
look at the scene. In his report to the UN Protection Forces 
[UNPROFOR] he explicitly points out that it is impossible to say 
whether the shell was fired from a Serbian or a Muslim position. 
As you know, the latter is said to have already happened 
before, precisely before important UN resolutions or peace 
negotiations, so that one could suppose that there is method in 
it. 
  [Schneider] A Muslim from Sarajevo would probably answer you 
now that UNPROFOR's attitude toward the Serbs has always been 
friendly... 
  [Jovanovic] Therefore, I deliberately talked of an 
"objective side" before. Here I mean, for example, an expert 
commission consisting of Serbs, Muslims, and UNPROFOR people. 
Believe me, the FRY has the greatest interest in finding and 
severely punishing those who are responsible for this massacre 
of innocent civilians. A criminal act like this is an infamous 
blow against the general peace process and, for that reason 
alone, it has to be speedily cleared up. 
  By that time, I can only appeal to the parties involved not 
to permit any manipulation of this tragic event by politicians 
or the media. Possible intervention, whatever the excuse for it 
may be, would only mean more war and far less peace. The 
solution for the Bosnian problem is to be pursued through the 
negotiations in Geneva and not through bombs. 
  [Schneider] Should this course not be possible in the 
foreseeable future, do you actually see the danger that the 
Bosnian civil war will also spread to Macedonia or Kosovo? 
  [Jovanovic] The civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina might only 
spread to other areas if -- to put it cautiously -- those 
foreign "factors" whose interests are also otherwise involved in 
this war wished it. The temporary orientation of the attention 
of the public and the mass media toward Kosovo and Macedonia or, 
to be more straightforward, the downright provocation of war in 
these regions, could be a variant in the game of interests of 
these factors. 
  At any rate, my country is not interested in prolonging the 
civil war in Bosnia by a single day, to say nothing of spreading 
it to other areas. 
  [Schneider] However, Zhirinovskiy's recent visit to Bosnia, 
his inflammatory nationalist speeches, and the exuberant 
applause of the Serbs there have again caused serious doubts in 
the West about Yugoslavia's desire for peace. How do you -- to 
change the subject for a moment -- assess Zhirinovskiy's success 
in the election and his chances in Russia? 
  [Jovanovic] The rise of the Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia, headed by Mr. Zhirinovskiy, is an important fact and a 
special phenomenon. It is a phenomenon that requires more 
profound studies and a more serious explanation than is possible 
in an answer to a journalist's question. At any rate, his 
chances to continue to influence his country's domestic policy 
life and foreign policy will also depend on whether his party 
finds the right answers to the real needs and problems of 
today's Russia and how good they are. 
  [Schneider] Let us finally come back again to the present 
Yugoslavia: Must the separate peace agreement that was recently 
concluded with Croatia and that the Croatian media celebrated as 
recognition not appear to the Krajina Serbs as a betrayal 
because of their problems with President Tudjman? 
  [Jovanovic] What you call a separate peace agreement is an 
agreement between the FRY and the Republic of Croatia on the 
mutual opening of official representations and offices. It is 
not recognition, but an important, constructive step and the 
clear beginning of a normalization of the present situation, 
which is to be concluded by the establishment of full diplomatic 
relations. 
  However, as I have said: This agreement is only the 
beginning of this road. It does not prejudice the solution of 
the existing problems, particularly not the problem of the 
Serbian Krajina. However, the agreement will certainly 
facilitate the gradual solution of these problems and help to 
establish peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina more quickly. 
  [Schneider] Foreign Minister, thank you for the interview.

  [Text] The massacre at the Sarajevo market last week and 
the quick accusations that the Army of the Srpska republic 
committed this appalling act which resulted in the NATO Council 
ultimatum along with a serious threat of raiding Serbian 
positions, unambiguously confirm the assessments by military 
analysts that the territory of the former Yugoslavia as planned 
by AVNOJ [Anti- Fascist Council of National Liberation of 
Yugoslavia] has obviously been assigned the role of an 
experimental training ground for the creators of the so-called 
new world order. It goes without saying that just as in any 
experiment in which one does not implement the known methods and 
procedures, so in the one on the territory of the former 
Yugoslav federation one ignores valid norms of international law 
and universally accepted principles of the UN Charter, the 
Helsinki Act of the CSCE, the Paris Charter for a New Europe, 
and other international conventions. 
  The most recent foul massacre of innocent civilians in 
Sarajevo -- carried out according to an already used scenario 
and with a strong media campaign against the Serbs who are 
accused without any proofs -- has been planned with a view to 
postponing peace negotiations indefinitely and forcing the 
Serbian side to make new concessions to the Muslims. As we 
already know, this has been used as an excuse for the world 
centers of power to exert pressure on the Serbs again, which was 
also demonstrated at the aforementioned NATO meeting in Brussels. 
  It is no coincidence that Manfred Woerner, secretary general 
of that only remaining military-political alliance, was given 
the honor of triumphantly announcing one more ultimatum to the 
Serbs on the model of the one from the distant 1914. It is not 
surprising as it is coming from the German Woerner. He would 
like to settle the debts from the wars gone by. However, we are 
asking what we have done to our European allies and the United 
States to make them constantly threaten us. Perhaps by being on 
these regions for centuries, we are standing in the way of their 
cartographers who would like to delineate new spheres of 
interest on the already multicolored political map of the 
Balkans. And interests -- as their slogan says -- are stronger 
than distant war alliances and friendships. 
  One should not therefore be surprised when current U.S. 
President Clinton frequently stresses that he harbors true 
fondness for better positions of the Bosnian Muslims, in which 
he is supported by a large group of oil-rich Islamic countries 
and France, Great Britain, and, of course, Germany, not to 
mention others. 
  By reading more carefully the announcement of the NATO 
Council of 9 February, which obviously encroaches onto the 
powers of the UN Security Council, one notices an ultimatum-like 
demand issued to the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw heavy weapons to 
20 km from the center of Sarajevo in 10 days starting from 10 
February 1994 at 2400. The demand to Muslim authorities is to 
put their heavy weaponry under UNPROFOR [United Nations 
Protection Force] control within the same deadline and, as it is 
written, to refrain from attacks along the existing lines of 
confrontation in the city. 
  Further on, it is pointed out that heavy weaponry of any of 
the sides which is found within the forbidden zone will be 
exposed to air strikes by the NATO forces which will be carried 
out in close coordination with the UN secretary general and in 
conformity with the decisions of the NATO Council. 
  Even such as it is, this document could be a step toward the 
calming down of the clashes. However, the experiences they have 
had so far warn the Bosnian Serbs to be cautious, because who is 
to guarantee that the Muslims will not again stage a performance 
for the world media so that the command of the NATO southern 
wing may order air strikes at the Serbs? The Serbs will in that 
case not sit with their arms crossed and head bowed but will 
respond according to their own possibilities which, as even the 
potential attackers admit, are not to be underestimated. 
  Some time at the beginning of last year, one could read in 
the MOSCOW NEWS the statement by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev on the occasion of the demand by the Western partners 
for Russia to take into account the pressure by Muslim countries 
when assessing these partners' behavior towards the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. If we agreed with the very 
possibility of pressure by the countries that see the Bosnian 
Muslims as their clients, then it is easy to imagine the 
formation of a group of Christian countries, with a division 
into a Catholic and Orthodox groups within it. Then the third 
world war as well can really begin in Sarajevo.

  [Text] Pristina, 10 Feb (TANJUG) -- Borislav Prelevic, the 
vice president of the Party of Serbian Unity [Stranka Srpskog 
Jedinstva -- SSJ], said in Pristina today he demanded that 
Ibrahim Rugova, the president of the Democratic Alliance of 
Kosovo [Demokratski Savez Kosova -- DSK], be arrested in, as he 
put it, "his capacity as the leader of an enemy terrorist 
organization." 
  At a news conference, Prelevic said that Rugova and his 
aides 
were explicitly working on dismantling the Serbian state in this 
area. He also warned that they themselves would bring Rugova to 
court if official organs failed to arrest him. 
  Borislav Prelevic told the press about a recent meeting 
between Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the leader of the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia, and SSJ President Zeljko Raznjatovic 
Arkan, saying that on an that occasion Arkan had been given a 
secret weapon. This is a solar and laser weapon tested in 
real-life conditions, called "Elipton," Prelevic explained. 
  According to Prelevic, Zhirinovskiy and Arkan signed a 
treaty 
on military cooperation that envisages, among other things, that 
in "the event of foreign aggression against any Serbian land 
dozens of thousands of Kozaks will come to their aid."

  [Text] Belgrade, 11 Feb (TANJUG) -- In reaction to the 
latest developments in and around Bosnia-Herzegovina, FRY 
[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] President Zoran Lilic has sent 
a telegram to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali. 
  According to the FRY President's Office, the telegram says 
that the FRY upholds the European Union's proposal on resolving 
the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as the agreement on a 
cease- fire and the demilitarization of Sarajevo signed by the 
Bosnian Serb and Muslim sides. 
  The FRY president stresses that this gives Yugoslavia all 
the 
more reason to be concerned over NATO's perplexing decision to 
search for a solution through ultimatums and military might, and 
adds that such decisions could invoke the continuation of the 
war, while peace can only be achieved through negotiations on an 
equal footing. NATO's decision is an unauthorized assumption of 
the UN Security Council's political competences by this military 
alliance. 
  President Lilic also says that the FRY is firmly convinced 
that the United Nations alone is authorized to reach such 
political decisions, especially concerning the use of force. 
  The FRY president also appeals to the UN secretary general 
to 
take all necessary measures in order that the UN Security 
Council may regain its usurped political rights in resolving the 
crisis in former Bosnia-Herzegovina [as received], which would 
ensure a successful outcome of the Geneva peace process.

  [Text] Belgrade, 10 Feb (TANJUG) -- Vojislav Seselj, 
president of the Serbian Radical Party [SRS], said today that 
the Srpska republic should totally reject yesterday's NATO 
ultimatum. At a news conference Seselj stressed that the 
radicals advocate negotiations and a truce with the Muslim side 
on a reciprocal basis but NATO should not interfere. 
  "If the Srpska republic and the Muslim Jamahiriyah 
[Bosnia-Herzegovina] agree on a cease-fire and the withdrawal of 
heavy weaponry, such an agreement should be respected, but NATO 
has no right to interfere," the SRS leader says. He welcomed 
Radovan Karadzic's statement that everyone who talks to Serbs in 
the language of ultimatums should consider the Austro-Hungarian 
empire's experience. 
  Seselj said that the massacre in Sarajevo's marketplace was 
staged by the Muslim regime and that it evidently demonstrated 
that Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic is a "religious fanatic" 
who does not think about human lives, as he wants to trigger 
foreign military intervention. 
  In the event of an attack on Serb positions in Bosnia, the 
SRS leader said, every Serb's patriotic duty will be to resist 
this aggression. "We would regard such an attack in the same 
way we would regard aggression against Serbia, Montenegro, and 
the Serb republic of Krajina; in such a case the SRS would rally 
all volunteers from the SRS and Serbian chetnik movement and 
dispatch them to the territory of the Srpska republic." He 
noted that in this event all interparty squabbling should be 
relegated to the background. 
  Asked about his personal view, Seselj said that in the event 
of an attack "one should pound all NATO's possible targets -- 
bases in Italy and other countries from which aircraft would be 
operating -- as well as UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] troops." 
  "Air raids can achieve nothing. I believe this is how the 
Serbs will react, whereas we radicals will take part in this 
reaction," the SRS leader stressed.

  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 10 (AFP) -- NATO air strikes against 
Bosnian Serb positions around Sarajevo would lead to war in the 
Balkans and even Europe, a military spokesman for the rump 
Yugoslavia warned Thursday. 
  "It would provoke a big war in the Balkans and even in 
Europe 
and UN peacekeepers would then become enemies of the Serbs," 
Colonel Ljubodrag Stojadinovic said in reponse to NATO's 
ultimatum warning the Serbs to withdraw all of their heavy 
weapons from around Sarajevo by February 21 or face raids by 
NATO warplanes. 
  His warning, carried by the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA, 
was the first official Serb reaction to the ultimatum, which was 
sparked by the weekend attack on a Sarajevo market that left 68 
people dead and 197 wounded. 
  Stojadinovic said the massacre was nothing but a "bloody and 
fabricated farce" adding that he backed calls by Bosnian Serb 
leader Radovan Karadzic for an investigation into the attack. 
  Karadzic walked out of peace talks in Geneva Thursday, 
saying 
he refused to participate unless the responsibility for the 
mortar attack was determined. 
  The semiofficial Yugoslav news agency TANJUG also criticized 
the NATO ultimatum Thursday saying that it reflected a decision 
made by "mediocre politicians." 
  "A group of mediocre politicians, especially those within 
the 
European Community, are making mistakes that are becoming more 
and more serious, without learning any lessons from previous 
mistakes," the agency, which generally reflects the Serb 
government's opinion, said.

  [Text] At today's news conference by the Kosova Democratic 
Alliance, reporters were told that the meeting of president of 
the republic of Kosova Dr. Ibrahim Rugova with U.S. President 
Bill Clinton in Washington testifies that the world knows and 
accepts the self-identity of Kosova and that the Serbian 
attempts to present Kosova as its internal affair are futile. 
  This news conference also greeted the NATO ultimatum on the 
withdrawal from Sarajevo of the heavy artillery of Serbian 
forces as a precondition to solving the question of Bosnia.

  [Text] [Announcer] Tense situation reported in Kosova. 
The Serbian police raided the building of the Kosova Democratic 
Alliance [LDK] Presidency. There are reports of other raids in 
Gjakove, Klin, Peje, Podujeve, Vushtrri, and Ferizaj. Let us 
listen to a telephone report by our correspondent Mehmet Haziri: 
  [Haziri] In a press communique, the Kosova Information 
Center reports that large police forces have been surrounding 
the building of the LDK Presidency in Prishtina since 1200 [1100 
GMT] today. Meanwhile, groups of policemen raided its others 
offices and halls. An LDK administration employee, who was in 
the building with three other people, said that the Serbian 
police gave no explanations at all about this intervention. The 
raid lasted over an hour and, as we were informed, the police 
confiscated many belongings and various reports of this party, 
the biggest party of Albanians in the former Yugoslav territory. 
  During the last 10 days, police interventions in cultural 
manifestations and in the seats of political parties have been 
more frequent. 
  The LDK, as the biggest real and organized force, is the 
target of the Serbian attacks. Several days ago, the Kosova 
branch of the so-called Party of Serbian Unity, led by 
ultranationalist Velko Rasnjatovic Arkan, publicly requested the 
imprisonment of president of the republic of Kosova Dr. Ibrahim 
Rugova. This fact clearly testifies to Serbia's stance against 
the international demand to cool the nationalist fanatics, whose 
craziness is applied by the police in the field with raids, 
maltreatments, and arrests of Albanians.
