  [Excerpt] At a news conference held in Bangkok in Thailand 
today, Czech President Vaclav Havel supported the stance of 
NATO, which threatens to carry out air strikes against Bosnian 
Serbs units unless they pull out their heavy artillery weapons 
from the vicinity of Sarajevo before 21 February. 
  At the same time, he expressed a hope that NATO was serious 
about this threat and that those whom the threat concerns are 
aware of it. President Havel said that his talks with Thai 
representatives were successful. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has questioned the 
effectiveness of possible air strikes against Bosnia. Speaking 
at a news conference of the Civic Democratic Party yesterday, he 
emphasized once again that this civil war should be solved not 
by external interference but by internal settlement. Klaus was 
skeptical in particular about air force deployment. He felt 
that, in humane terms, this is unfair. Given this type of civil 
war, in which there are no fronts or clearly defined positions 
of the armies, any global solutions, and air strikes, in 
particular, pose a threat of far greater massacres and 
catastrophes, he asserted.

<F P=106> [CTK report: "Intervention Would Be an Extreme Remedy"] </F>
  [Text] Prague--Czech diplomatic policy considers air 
strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina to be an extreme means of exerting 
pressure that may contribute to resolving some of the specific 
issues but, obviously, cannot act as a substitute for an overall 
political solution to the conflict. This point of view is 
contained in a statement from the Czech Foreign Ministry issued 
yesterday by its Press Department. The Foreign Ministry is 
extremely alarmed by recent developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
It considers the Saturday [5 February] massacre of the civilian 
population in Sarajevo to be an extreme manifestation of 
brutality. The UN Security Council, of which the Czech Republic 
is a nonpermanent member, has already adopted a resolution that 
makes it possible to use air strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina in 
strictly specified cases. The tragedy in Sarajevo's market 
should finally induce all three warring factions to display a 
real political interest in resolving the conflict around the 
negotiating table, declares the Czech Foreign Ministry's 
statement.

  [Text] Jiri Payne, chairman of the Foreign Committee of the 
Chamber of Deputies of the Czech parliament, has canceled his 
trip to Libya. Our parliamentary correspondent Milan Repka 
reports. 
  [Repka] Jiri Payne should have left for a two-day official 
visit to Libya today. According to our information, he decided 
not to go. Deputy Chairman Jan Kasal told Czech radio that the 
Chamber's leadership did not cancel any foreign trips. 
  Pavel Seifer, deputy from the Liberal Social Union, said 
that, in his view, this indicates the Civic Democratic Party's 
[ODS] preparation to quietly dismiss Payne from the post of the 
chairman of the Chamber's Foreign Committee. But ODS press 
spokeswoman Jana Petrova denied this. She told Czech radio that 
the ODS leadership proposed nothing of the kind to Payne. 
  Regarding the connection between Payne's pronouncements 
during his visit to the United States and the abolition of his 
trip to Libya, Petrova said that she did not know why Payne was 
not going to Libya. 
  A meeting of the Chamber of Deputies is due to open on 15 
February. It is likely that a proposal to dismiss the present 
chairman of the foreign committee from his post will be 
submitted there.

<F P=106> [Article by Gustav Krch and Jan T. Vavra: "The Czech </F>
Republic's Exports to the Visegrad Four Countries Last Year 
Amounted To Almost 93 Billion Korunas"] 
  [Text] According to the Czech Statistical Office, the 
Czech Republic returned a surplus foreign trade balance last 
year with all of the other Visegrad Four countries. 
  Foreign trade turnover with Hungary increased by 15.9 
percent, compared with 1992, while imports from Hungary 
increased by more than 50 percent, compared with 1992. On the 
other hand, exports to and imports from Poland declined, and 
overall foreign trade turnover fell by 10 percent. 
  Exports to the Visegrad Four countries in 1993 amounted to 
93.982 billion korunas [Kc], which is almost one-quarter of 
their overall volume. Our imports from the Visegrad Four states 
amounted to Kc79.270 billion (21.6 percent of Czech imports). 
Naturally, Slovakia accounted for most of our turnover. 
Exports amounted to Kc74.628 billion and imports to Kc65.017 
billion. Goods worth Kc10.470 billion were exported to Poland, 
while exports to Hungary amounted to Kc7.884 billion. On the 
other hand, imports from Poland reached Kc9.273 billion and from 
Hungary Kc5.003 billion. 
  The Visegrad Four countries will in the future be members of 
the Central European Free Trade Association (CEFTA), which 
should commence operations on 1 January 1998. It will encompass 
approximately 7,500 different commodities. These are divided 
into three groups in accordance with the different periods of 
time involved in breaking down the customs barriers. The first 
group, where there is already no duty, concerns more than 2,200 
products. From the point of view of the percentage of mutual 
trade, these are less significant products, and removing customs 
barriers should not influence their ability to compete. The 
second group contains some 3,700 products. According to the 
approved agreement, the current duty on these products will be 
maintained this year; it will be reduced by 66 percent in 1995 
and by the remaining 33 percent in 1996. The customs barriers 
for the last, most sensitive, group will probably be removed in 
the year 2001. Agricultural products are, in essence, exempt 
from the CEFTA agreement. Only partial liberalization is 
envisaged here in the future.

Technical Equipment From the Persian Gulf"] 
  [Text] Prague--Despite the fact that as long ago as last 
November the U.S. Department of Defense indicated its interest 
in the chemical instruments used by Czech soldiers to gauge the 
presence of sarin and yperit in the Gulf war, the Pentagon has 
not yet taken delivery of this equipment. 
  The staff of the Press Department at the Czech Ministry of 
Defense reported that the U.S. side is finishing the text of an 
agreement on the basis of which the transfer of the equipment is 
to be executed. The Czech side is ready for the transaction. 
  The Pentagon, which acknowledged the results of the readings 
by the Czechoslovak chemical warfare unit from the war against 
Iraq two years ago, wanted to test the measuring instruments in 
chemical laboratories in the United States to assess the 
reliability of the data. 
  The Pentagon was particularly interested in the prototype 
for 
a simple, yet effective instrument for rapid detection of the 
most dangerous toxic substances of the orgonophosphate type 
known as Detehit. It also wanted to examine the PCHL-90 
portable chemical laboratory and the DP-86 modern digital 
dosimetric instruments used for detecting radioactive 
contamination. If the instruments tested well, the Americans 
would allegedly buy them.

  [Text] The president of the republic's spokesman reports 
that President of the Republic Sali Berisha hailed NATO's 
ultimate decision to undertake air strikes if the 10-day 
deadline to withdraw heavy weapons from around Sarajevo is not 
respected or if further bombardments of this city take place, 
with the conviction that this decision will contribute to 
accelerating the establishment of peace in the Republic of 
Bosnia. Berisha also stressed that Albania reconfirms its offer 
of airport facilities that NATO may need to accomplish its 
missions within the UN framework. 
  He also considered the U.S. Administration's decision to 
recognize the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as important 
for stability in the region and stressed that the resolution of 
the contradictions between our two neighbors, Greece and 
Macedonia, regarding the name and symbols, is in the interests 
not only of the bilateral relations of these countries but also 
of stability in the south of the Balkans.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi by Aferdita </F>
Sokoli in Tirana; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Sokoli] Mr. Minister, what did your participation 
in the Geneva meeting achieve? 
  [Serreqi] An open discussion was held there. Every minister 
presented his own options and ideas regarding the crisis. Since 
this meeting coincided with the NATO meeting and the fact that 
many more important decisions other than the mandate of this 
conference were expected, it is understandable that the 
importance of this conference was diminished and somewhat 
reduced to an informal exchange of opinions. 
  The Albanian side, of course, presented its own opinions and 
options, stressing that the choices suggested so far, 
particularly the division of Bosnia, offer neither peace nor a 
peaceful solution to the region. At the same time, this is a 
precedence with unforeseen consequences. 
  The meeting discussed at length the embargo, its 
application, 
and the economic consequences. We were very categorical that 
Albania, as one of the countries that has applied the embargo 
most rigorously and as one of the countries that is most 
affected by the embargo, insists that this embargo continues, as 
the only possibility and the only measure that the international 
community has so far implemented against Serbia. Its handling 
and the opinions to facilitate or abolish it should be solved 
along with other very important elements of the crisis, such as 
solving the problem of Albanians in Kosova and elsewhere. 
  [Sokoli] Since the two meetings coincided, how did the 
participating sides react? 
  [Serreqi] The participants did not maintain the same stance. 
Of course, we favored the already known position that Albania is 
deeply convinced that the international community, NATO, and the 
United Nations should restore its credibility and give a clear 
testimony that concrete measures should be taken against the 
aggressor. 
  [Sokoli] What about the Greek reaction? 
  [Serreqi] Of course, it is already well known that the Greek 
position was completely different from ours.

  [Text] Albanian President Sali Berisha held a meeting with 
Ibrahim Rugova, president of the republic of Kosova. Both 
presidents assessed as very fruitful and useful the meeting of 
Mr. Rugova with President Clinton and the talks he held at the 
Department of State. They pointed out that these talks are a 
clear expression of a proper understanding of the necessity to 
solve the problem of Kosova on the part of President Clinton's 
administration. 
  The difficult situation of the Albanians in Kosova and the 
situation in the region were at the focus of the Berisha-Rugova 
meeting. Both presidents expressed full support for NATO's 
decision on the ultimatum and are of the opinion that the 
recognition of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia by the 
United States contributes to the stability in the south of the 
Balkans.

  [Text] Nikolay Slatinski, chairman of the Parliamentary 
National Security Commission, today sent a letter to President 
Zhelev in which he states that during the past few days 
increasingly militarist statements are being made and decisions 
adopted in connection with the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Bulgaria advocates seeking a peaceful solution to the crisis 
and has repeatedly declared its firm resolve not to intervene in 
any form in the events taking place in former Yugoslavia. At 
this critical juncture, any change in the Bulgarian position is 
absolutely impossible, Slatinski emphasizes in his letter. 
  Nikolay Slatinski appeals to the president to employ his 
constitutional powers more resolutely with a view to achieving 
greater coordination and integration of the efforts of the 
political elite in the legislative and executive powers to 
defend the national position on the crisis in former Yugoslavia.

  [Text] Today, 11 February, the National Assembly gave its 
approval to the 1994 budget bill at its first reading. 
  The budget is austere, and its defense by the parliamentary 
majority was flaccid and unconvincing, Ivan Kostov declared on 
behalf of the parliamentary group of the SDS [Union of 
Democratic Forces]. He added -- I quote his words: It is so 
because it is not proposed by a responsible political force and 
a stable executive power with clear economic policies. The 
budget is connected with an increase in the tax burden, which is 
not a gesture toward private business and the population. [no 
reference to close of quotation as heard] 
  According to Nora Ananieva, leader of the BSP [Bulgarian 
Socialist Party] parliamentary group, the budget, in its adopted 
interim form, contains a number of chances both for various 
social strata in the country and for Bulgaria to obtain foreign 
financing. 
  Stefan Bozhilov of the New Alliance for Democracy declared 
that the imperfections in the budget are due to the legacy of 
communist rule. 
  The Rights and Freedoms Movement positively assessed the 
budget, despite the failure of the privatization process so far. 
  The final adoption of the budget is tied up with many 
demands 
relating to the structural reform, the social sphere, and 
science and education.

of an aerial bombing attack against Serbs, the BBC quotes Prime 
Minister Peter Boross. According to the Budapest 
corrrespondent, the Hungarian Government is concerned that by 
allowing NATO to use Hungarian airspace for bombing attacks, 
Hungary would become involved in the war in Yugoslavia, and that 
the step would also harm the situation of Hungarians in 
Vojvodina.

<F P=106> [Endre Aczel editorial: "Passing on Responsibility"] </F>
  [Text] If we strip certain issues to the bare facts, we 
will find that the United States of America has actually 
threatened Hungary lest it become closer to the rump Yugoslavia. 
  The threat was contained in U.S. Foreign Affairs Spokesman 
McCurry's statement according to which the United States "views 
all actions that might ease Serbia's isolation with deepest 
concern." 
  Before saying this, McCurry listed "plans" to broaden 
communication between Budapest and Belgrade. Plans that are 
known to Washington and condemned by it. 
  We know that it is not usually inconsequential when a very 
large country says to a very small country that it is "deeply 
concerned" about what the latter is doing or is preparing to do. 
The lightest of such consequences is a reprimand. Foreign 
Minister Jeszenszky (or the Hungarian Government) has received 
this. In nearly four years, it has not had such a conflict with 
any western power, so this in itself indicates the gravity of 
the event. 
  However, after all this introduction, what I have to say is 
that the Government of the United States is acting unjustly when 
it calls the renewed Hungarian-Serbian dialogue a source of 
danger that might "undermine" the UN embargo policy afflicting 
Yugoslavia. Washington's strictness with us is nothing other 
than camouflage of its own (many times proved) lack of a 
concept, a kind of searching for responsibility elsewhere. 
  So, who is actually "undermining" the embargo policy here? 
  Hungary, which is heroically adhering to the embargo policy 
that is far too costly for it, was only an observer, rather than 
a participant, in the German-French efforts that actually held 
out the possibility of ending the sanctions, providing that the 
Serbs fulfill certain conditions. However, without expressing 
its opinion, the United States itself was also an observer. (At 
that time, Clinton was very much occupied with NAFTA [North 
American Free Trade Agreement], APEC [Asia Pacific Economic 
Community], and GATT....) Therefore, the end of the sanctions 
policy did not even originate in Hungary. This makes it even 
more interesting that, at the time, Washington did not reprimand 
Paris and Bonn, and why it did not later reprimand the Bosnian 
Muslims who swept the entire promising German-French plan 
(including the already implemented Serbian and Croatian 
allowances) off the table, and this is how the sanctions policy 
remained in force. 
  Well, ever since, we have not seen any viable ideas from 
Clinton and his team as to what should really be done. (We now 
know what we should not do. As if the outcome of the south Slav 
crisis depended on Hungarian-Serbian customs and border 
cooperation....) What is even worse, America proved to be 
completely unable to form or coordinate the West's and NATO's 
Bosnia policy. This whole issue is a tale of the appearance and 
widening of gaps between the U.S., French, British, and German 
viewpoints. Seemingly, the Americans have always been more 
radical than the Europeans but, in reality, they would not for 
anything have moved away from the periphery of events. Whatever 
happens now, the American role would not become better in 
retrospect.

  [Text] Geneva, Feb 1O (AFP) -- Croatia and the Bosnian 
Government agreed here Thursday to call for UN surveillance of 
Bosnia's borders to monitor arms and troop movements, amid 
renewed hopes for improved bilateral relations. 
  Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic said "constructive" 
talks with Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic on the 
sidelines of the all-party Geneva conference had focused on "a 
model of organisation of Bosnia-Herzegovina after a general 
normalisation" of relations between the two sides. In a joint 
statement both men said separate letters would be sent to the UN 
Security Council calling for border surveillance. 
  Zagreb has denied repeated accusations that regular Croatian 
troops are fighting in central Bosnia, where Bosnian Croat and 
mainly-Moslem Bosnian Government forces are engaged in a bitter 
territorial conflict. 
  Granic said military chiefs from the two warring parties 
were 
scheduled to meet next week in Sarajevo. He added that he and 
Silajdzic would step up efforts to ensure the unconditional 
exchange of prisoners of war and the repatriation of refugees. 
  Bosnia's ambassador to Bern, Muhamad Filipovic, told AFP 
that 
the bilateral talks offered "a very good chance to improve 
relations and stop the fighting in central Bosnia." UN-led 
controls on Bosnia's borders were desirable to prevent Belgrade 
from equipping Bosnian Serb forces with extra men and weapons, 
he added. 
  Zagreb's ambassador to the United Nations, Mario Nobilo, 
said 
border controls would staunch the flow of arms from Serb-held 
areas of Bosnia to Krajina, the self-declared Serbian republic 
inside Croatia. Nobilo also stressed the need to avoid "further 
misunderstandings" over the nature of ZAgreb's support for the 
Bosnian Croats. 
  He added that Bosnian Government and Croatian officials were 
also discussing the make-up of the future Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
"The Moslems would like to see a more centralised form of 
government, with cantons," he said, while the Croatian side 
favoured a three-way union also incorportating a Serb mini-state. 
  Earlier Thursday Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said 
the all-party Geneva talks aimed at securing a negotiated 
settlement to the Bosnian war had stalled because the Moslems 
were refusing to investigate Saturday's bloody mortar attack in 
Sarajevo which has been widely blamed on his forces. 
  "We could not go further until we resolve this," Karadzic 
told reporters, referring to establishing responsibility for the 
mortar attack that killed 68 and sparked a NATO ultimatum to the 
Bosnian Serbs to remove their heavy weapons from Sarajevo by 
February 21 or face air strikes.

  [Text] Warsaw, 11 Feb--The Foreign Affairs Ministry has 
made the following statement available to the Polish Press 
Agency: 
  "The Polish Government resolutely condemns all acts of 
violence taking place in Bosnia-Herzegovina, including in 
particular, the terrorist shooting of the civilian population in 
Sarajevo. 
  In the opinion of the Polish Government, the stand of the 
NATO states, as presented in the decisions taken during the 
North Atlantic Council session of 9 February this year, is a 
balanced one toward all sides in the conflict. It takes into 
account, in the right way, the role of the United Nations and 
meets its resolutions half-way. It takes into consideration the 
necessity of insuring the complete security of the UN forces and 
that of other observation and humanitarian missions that find 
themselves on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. 
  This last matter is of particular importance for Poland in 
view of the presence of a Polish contingent in the UN Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR). 
  The Polish Government shares the stand of the NATO states, 
and expresses the hope that the present heightening of the 
conflict can be defused without the need to use force."

  [Text] Zagreb, Feb 12 (AFP) -- Croatia is prepared to 
withdraw "elements" of its army currently fighting in Bosnia if 
the UN pledges to guarantee the security of Croat enclaves in 
central Bosnia, Foreign Minister Mate Granic said Saturday [12 
February]. 
  Granic told journalists he made the proposal in a letter 
Friday to United Nations Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. 
  As well as proposing the withdrawal of "elements" of its 
army 
deployed south of the southern Bosnia-Herzegovina city of 
Mostar, Zagreb also called on the UN to set up frontier controls 
on the border between Bosnia and Croatia. 
  "At the same time, Croatia is asking for guarantees from the 
UN concerning the security of the Croat enclaves in central 
Bosnia," Granic added. 
  The troops in question were deployed on both sides of the 
Neretva River along a 27-kilometre (16-mile) corridor between 
the border and the town of Buna, south of Mostar, Granic added. 
  Granic said the troops stationed east of the river were 
Croatian Army regulars, and those on the western bank were 
"former members of the Croatian Army" fighting as "volunteers" 
alongside Bosnian Croat forces. 
  On February 3, the UN Security Council called on Croatia to 
immediately withdraw all its regular forces from Bosnia or face 
international sanctions. 
  The UN has estimated between 3,000 and 5,000 Croatian 
regulars are fighting in Bosnia. 
  Zagreb has denied the allegation, but admitted it has 
deployed troops south of Mostar and in the hinterland of the 
Croatian Adriatic port of Dubrovnik, and that around 2,000 
Croatian military "volunteers" are active inside Bosnia.

  This was stated at a news conference in Prague today by 
Zoran 
Thaler, the chairman of the Slovenian Parliament's Foreign 
Committee, who is heading a delegation of this committee on a 
two-day visit to the Czech Republic. 
  Too much has been achieved in Bosnia by military means so 
now 
it will be difficult to approach the solution merely in a 
political way, he stressed.

  [Text] An extraordinary meeting of the HZDS [Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia] leadership is being held in Modra near 
Bratislava today. The meeting is to discuss differences of 
views that have clearly taken shape within the past few days. 
Our colleague Renata Havranova, editor of the PRACE daily, 
reports: 
  [Havranova] The extraordinary session of the HZDS national 
leadership is to decide today about the stance to be taken by 
the ruling movement on solving a serious political crisis in 
Slovakia--the crisis that was brought about by the HZDS itself, 
with some SNS [Slovak National Party] deputies, by obstructions 
in the [Slovak] parliament. Since early this morning, the Modra 
hotel has been totally closed to journalists. 
  [HZDS] press spokeswoman Ivana Salczerova confirmed that 
Prime Minister [Vladimir] Meciar had taken the floor, as he had 
promised, to give his view on the Alternative of Political 
Realism formed in Papiernicka, which is being supported by nine 
deputies--one of the original 10 signatories has withdrawn its 
signature--and two government members, [Deputy Prime Minister] 
Roman Kovac and [Foreign Minister] Jozef Moravcik. Meciar is 
said to have described once again their appeal to immediately 
form a government of broad coalition without political heads as 
an immoral, undemocratic appeal contradicting the movement's 
principles. According to Meciar, the action taken by Moravcik 
and Kovac is a dirty trick, not only on him personally but also 
on the entire government and all of its members. 
  This afternoon, journalists came across Jozef Moravcik 
walking in the streets of this little town. He confirmed to 
them that the discussion was very sharp and that all those who 
had joined the Alternative were probably going to be pacified by 
the [HZDS] leadership. He also said that a proposal was voiced 
asking him and Roman Kovac to resign. He is determined not to 
resign. According to Minister Moravcik, whatever decision is 
made at today's session of the leadership, there is no doubt 
that the shaping of views has already begun, and it is no longer 
possible to halt it.

  [Text] Sarajevo, February 13 (TANJUG) -- Special United 
Nations envoy for former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi has stopped 
the artillery withdrawal around Sarajevo assessing that the 
Bosnian Serbs' heavy weapons could be efficiently controlled 
where they are at present, Chief of the General Staff of the 
Serbian Army General Manojlo Milovanovic said on Sunday. 
  "The reason for stopping the withdrawal of artillery pieces 
is that the U.N. peacekeepers (UNPROFOR) are unable to secure 
efficient control of the Moslem infantry, which is envisaged by 
an agreement reached by the Moslem and Serb sides and UNPROFOR," 
General Milovanovic told a press conference after meeting with 
Chief of the UNPROFOR Command for Bosnia Angus Ramsey. 
  General Milovanovic and Ramsey met at Pale, the political 
centre of the Bosnian Serb Republic, to discuss Sarajevo's 
demilitarization and control of the agreed ceasefire which took 
effect at noon on Thursday. 
  The Bosnian Serb army has proposed that its artillery be 
controlled on its present positions with simultaneous control of 
the Moslem infantry because the Serb heavy weapons are a balance 
to the more numerous Moslem infantry, General Milovanovic said. 
  As UNPROFOR has failed to secure the control of the Moslem 
infantry Milovanovic said he did not allow the Serb artillery to 
be withdrawn. 
  The relevant documents, including NATO's ultimatum, do not 
insist categorically on a withdrawal of the artillery because 
they use the terms "withdrawal" and "placing under UNPROFOR 
control," he said. 
  "We have fulfilled our obligation by accepting to put our 
artillery under control on condition that the same is done with 
the Moslem infantry," General Milovanovic said. 
  Asked whether he took NATO threats seriously, he replied 
that, as a soldier, he did. 
  "I don't know what NATO will do but I know what we'll do - 
we'll defend ourselves," he said. 
  The North Atlantic Council on Wednesday gave ten days to the 
Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons 20 kilometres from 
the centre of Sarajevo or to place them under UNPROFOR control, 
or their positions would be bombed. 
  NATO also demanded from the Moslem side to place its heavy 
arms under UNPROFOR control.

  [Text] On 13 February President Zhelyu Zhelev departed for 
Brussels, where he will sign the documents regarding joining the 
Partnership for Peace initiative. This is how he described 
prior to the departure his position regarding NATO's ultimatum 
related to eventual air strikes against the Serbian positions 
around Sarajevo: 
  [Begin Zhelev recording] Our position is clear and 
unchanged. One must remember that we are not involved in the 
decisions and in the actions. Consequently, posing the question 
whether Bulgaria supports or opposes the air strikes is unfair 
to Bulgaria. 
  We participate very actively in the embargo. In this sphere 
we have a categorical commitment to the policy of the 
international community. However, we cannot do more than this 
because we are a Balkan country. If Yugoslavia was located say, 
in the Apennines or in the Pyrenees, rather than in the Balkans, 
then we could assume a more categorical position, or send Blue 
Helmets there. However, now we cannot do even this. We appeal 
to all Balkan states also to refrain from military participation 
in this conflict. [end recording] 
  In an interview for Radio Bulgaria earlier today President 
Zhelev declared that Bulgaria cannot remain outside the 
Partnership for Peace initiative, which encompasses all new 
democracies. According to him, this initiative is an important 
step toward our regular membership in NATO. According to 
President Zhelev, sooner or later Russia will also join this 
initiative under the force of the natural development of affairs. 
  Mr. Zhelev pointed out that there is no reason for any 
confrontation between the new democracies and Russia and 
especially between Bulgaria and Russia. If in Bulgaria there 
are certain circles -- communist, neocommunist, or postcommunist 
-- who view our joining NATO as a confrontation with Russia they 
do not understand the historical development of the process, the 
president said.

<F P=106> [Blendi Fevziu article: "State Secret -- Serious Threat"] </F>
  [Text] The trial of the year is approaching for the 
independent KOHA JONE, the country's largest newspaper, just as 
in May 1992 when every television news broadcast declared that 
the newspaper's director Nikolle Lesi was at the center of 
corruption in Lezhe, and in March 1993, when Editor-in-Chief 
Frangaj was held under house arrest for spreading panic. Now, 
in the final days of January 1994, Editor-in-Chief Frangaj and 
the journalist Martin Leka have been moved to one of the cold 
cells of Tirana prison. The controversial Press Law has begun 
to stretch its tentacles, as expected, only toward those 
opposing the government. KOHA JONE is again made accountable 
for revealing a secret, and the accuser in both cases is Defense 
Minister Zhulali. The case of a minister prosecuting a 
newspaper for stealing secrets twice within the space of 10 
months in unique. The case of an editor-in-chief of the 
country's largest newspaper being arrested with total ease on a 
simple charge raised by the minister is also unique. Logic 
dictates otherwise. The minister should be removed from the 
cabinet for incompetence. A minister who cannot keep his 
secrets in peacetime, and fills the pages of newspapers with 
them, cannot serve the country in time of war. The main 
question worrying the public today, however, is whether the news 
published in KOHA JONE is a secret and to what limits state 
secrets should extend. 
  The first question is very simple, and it seems that Frangaj 
and Leka are suffering because of a whim of Zhulali. The news 
about disarming officers ran round the offices of all the 
newspapers the following day, and thus would have circulated 
throughtout Albania. This argument has already been mentioned. 
Thousands of officers would return home unarmed and they could 
not lie to their wives and children that they had forgotten 
their revolvers at their units. 
  This is all the more true because is was a matter of an 
order, and since its formation the army has always acted on the 
basis of orders. Not every order is a secret. The document 
ordering the disarmament did not carry this seal. Moreover, 
this was not the first time. Months ago, ALEANCA and KOHA JONE 
published a memorandum of Gazidede, addressed to Kudret Cela, 
asking for the removal of S. Ngjela's right to practise law. 
This letter was headed "secret," but this did not prevent the 
newspapers from publishing it on their first pages. Gazidede 
not only did not raise a charge over the revelation of [words 
indistinct], but called on Prime Minister Meksi to make the 
necessary explanations before parliament. 
  State secrets are now the greatest surprise of the Press 
Law. 
Their unlimited scope, without boundary markers, could turn them 
into accident black spots where journalists could suffer for 
their profession zeal. They could become a weapon for the state 
to threaten rebellious citizens, and the Frangaj-Leka case is 
more than an example. From today, we will all become the slaves 
of this law, and our articles will be slashed by self-censorship 
and by state secrets. 
  The arrest of the two journalists is unjustifiable. If they 
have broken the law, they can be investigated while remaining 
free, which is entirely normal. The extreme measure of 
detention rather resembles pressure. None of their Albanian or 
foreign colleagues can agree to such a thing, which is a big 
minus mark for any regime. 
  RILINDJA DEMOKRATIKE violates the Press Law every day and at 
every moment, but nobody has accused it. It would be enough to 
mention the story of the files and the pseudonyms to directly 
prosecute the editor-in-chief of RILINDJA DEMOKRATIKE. If the 
daily lists of collaborators with the State Security Service 
published by RILINDJA DEMOKRATIKE are true, the newspaper is 
falling foul of the law. Parliament has still not decided to 
open the files and any act against this stand is considered 
illegal. It could quite easily be called revealing a state 
secret, and somebody could be punished. If the pseudonyms are 
false, RILINDJA DEMOKRATIKE could be accused of slander and 
disinformation, and the Press Law provides for such things. 
  The Press Law continues to strike at those who oppose it, 
through more than 38 court sessions against four criminally 
charged journalists of KOHA JONE, two of them charged in more 
than one case. Frangaj and Leka will continue to remain in 
isolation, because a minister can no longer trust his staff, and 
his secrets are walking the streets in the shape of disarmed 
officers.

<F P=106> [Letter from the Presidium of the Albanian Association of </F>
Professional Journalists addressed to Arben Qeleshi, Tirana 
District prosecutor in chief, and for the attention of President 
Sali Berisha, Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi, People's Assembly 
Chairman Pjeter Arbnori, and Procurator General Alush Dragoshi, 
in Tirana on 1 February: "We Demand the Immediate Release From 
Prison of the Journalists Aleksander Frangaj and Martin Leka. 
We Demand the Suspension of Criminal Charges Against Them"] 
  [Text] Dear Sirs: 
  The Albanian Association of Professional Journalists 
[Shoqata 
e Gazetareve Profesioniste te Shqiperise], assembling at an 
urgent meeting today, vigorously protests the arrest and 
unnecessary imprisonment on 31 January of Aleksander Frangaj, 
editor in chief of KOHA JONE and a member of the association's 
presidium, and of Martin Leka, a KOHA JONE journalist. Accused 
and imprisoned without trial for revealing state secrets and for 
slander, our colleagues Frangaj and Leka are today victims not 
only of the deep contradictions in our legislation, in which 
normally irreconcilable old and new dispositions coexist, but 
also of the escalated revanchism of the state against the free 
press, a revanchism which has for two years trained its sights 
only against free journalists and opposition papers, regardless 
of the fact that there have been excesses in the entire spectrum 
of the Albanian press. 
  Our association, after making contact with those who have 
formulated the accusation, examining the article that led to the 
two journalists' imprisonment, and consulting the Press Law and 
the Constitutional Dispositions, concludes: 
  1. Editor in Chief Aleksander Frangaj, by allowing the 
publication of an article by the journalist Martin Leka about 
the disarming of officers and noncommissioned officers, and also 
publishing a facsimile of the relevant order of the Defense 
Ministry, did not violate any article of the Press Law or any 
other disposition that provides for sanctions, with the 
exception of a ghostly article in the old Penal Code from the 
period of the dictatorship, which has de facto lapsed in the 
last three years, since a free press appeared in Albania. Apart 
from this the article about preserving secrets in the old 
Penal Code has nothing to do with the press, which was entirely 
controlled at that time. 
  As for Article 25 of the Law on the Status of Servicemen, it 
merely draws attention to the need to consult the dispositions 
on state secrets, and does not provide for any sanctions. 
Further, as far as the press is concerned, it emerges that this 
article is superseded by the penultimate article of the Press 
Law, which explicitly states that "All previous dispositions 
conflicting with this law are revoked." 
  2. While there is no clear and rigorous definition of what 
is considered a state secret, the defense minister's order 
applied to a large number of people in military uniform, and can 
in no way be considered a secret. Something that many thousands 
of people know before the day is out is no longer a state secret. 
  3. The journalist Martin Leka, in informing the reader about 
the defense minister's order and expressing his critical opinion 
of an order that obliged officers to leave their personal 
pistols in their units, acted according to the Constitutional 
Dispositions and the Press Law, which guarantee freedom of 
expression and freedom of the press as among the greatest 
inalienable victories of democracy in Albania. Our colleague 
Martin Leka has written about a true fact and cannot be accused 
of slander, despite an element of exaggeration in his article's 
headline, which in no way constitutes a crime. Under these 
conditions, not finding a single legal disposition under which 
our imprisoned fellow-journalists can be punished, the 
Association of Professional Journalists observes that: 
  Aleksander Frangaj and Martin Leka cannot be accused of any 
crime . 
  -- The crime of which they are charged has been devised 
without reason, has been contrived by the Tirana Prosecutor's 
Office under the pressure of the political state, and is part of 
a series of similar efforts to scare, discourage and punish free 
and opposition journalists. 
  Seriously concerned over the very dangerous consequences of 
such attacks and committed to defend, cultivate, and make more 
cultured the free press in Albania, our association demands: 
  From the Tirana Procurator's Office: 
  -- The immediate release from prison of the journalists 
Aleksander Frangaj and Martin Leka and the suspension of 
criminal charges against them. 
  From the president of the Republic: 
  -- The protection of the two arrested journalists, accused 
of 
a crime that the president himself has denied is any such thing, 
when he rightly said that "Journalists do not bear 
responsibility for revealing secrets." 
  From Prime Minister Meksi: 
  -- Every measure to halt the war of words against the free 
press and to achieve a civilized coexistence between the press 
and the state, like in Western democratic countries, especially 
the United States, where no journalists have ever been convicted 
even when they have published the plans of the Pentagon. 
  We also ask the government to ensure continual openness in 
communicating with the press, setting an example in bridging the 
gulf that has now been created between the government and the 
press. 
  From the People's Assembly: 
  -- Welcoming the fact that the People's Assembly has not 
approved any sanction against journalists for revealing secrets, 
we suggest to the Assembly that it should remove contradictions 
in Albanian legislation and further define in law what is to be 
considered a state secret in Albania, with the aim of 
eliminating abuses of the undefined and very broad concept of a 
secret. 
  In the hope that these demands will be considered as soon as 
possible, the association expresses full solidarity with all 
efforts to defend and develop press freedom in Albania.

<F P=106> [Report by Reis Cico] </F>
  [Text] [Announcer] Our correspondent Reis Cico has just 
arrived in the studio from the Palace of Congresses, where 
Presidents Berisha and Tabone held a news conference. Let's 
hear from him: 
  [Cico] Thank you Tefta. Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. 
As announced by our colleague Radi, both presidents have just 
ended their news conference in the Palace of Congresses. 
Without waiting for the last news edition, we thought we would 
provide a summary of the news conference. 
  At the beginning of the conference, both presidents made a 
short statement. First, President Sali Berisha took the floor. 
He stressed that Albanian-Maltese relations are very good and 
that both countries are determined to further develop the 
political, economic, and cultural cooperation in the future. 
President Berisha continued saying that we will cooperate in 
the field of tourism, petroleum, and agriculture. 
  Regarding foreign policy, Berisha said that we explained to 
our Maltese friend the goals of our policy, which are: the 
integration of Albania into Europe; the solution of the national 
question; and the prevention of the conflict [in former 
Yugoslavia] from extending to the south of the Balkans. Berisha 
also attached special attention to the problem of Kosova, saying 
categorically that there is no Balkan solution without the 
resolution of the Kosova problem. In this aspect, we request 
assistance from Malta and the whole international community. 
  A very important statement by President Berisha was the one 
I 
will now cite: The option of the division of Bosnia is 
absolutely hopeless in ending the war. The last massacre in 
Sarajevo best testifies to this viewpoint. Today, more than 
ever, it calls for the use of punitive blows against its Serbian 
authors, President Sali Berisha declared. 
  On his part, Maltese President Mr. Tabone publicly showed 
gratitude for the invitation and the hospitality he found in our 
country. The Maltese president said that we are united by the 
same humanitarian aims as well as security issues. Mr. Tabone 
assessed that bilateral relations are very good and that they 
will be strengthened in the future, because this is a desire of 
both countries and our two politicians. 
  Further, Mr. Tabone pointed out the fields of cooperation. 
At the end, according to the statements they made, both 
presidents were of the opinion that, beside the defined fields, 
other fields of cooperation exist, which will be studied by 
experts in the near future. 
  Later they answered questions. Questions and answers were, 
of course, numerous. We have set apart some of them. 
  A reporter asked Mr. Tabone about air strikes in Bosnia. Mr. 
Tabone replied that the question of air strikes in Bosnia is 
very complex and belongs both to NATO and the United Nations. 
That is why, he said, I cannot give you any kind of opinion 
regarding this problem. 
  Another question addressed to Mr. Berisha was: What will the 
Geneva regional conference, in which our Foreign Minister Alfred 
Serreqi will participate, bring about? Mr. Berisha said that 
this is a consultative conference and it will serve to sensitize 
all institutions, and particularly NATO, to undertake actions 
that have been trumpeted for a long time ago, such as selective 
air strikes against Serbian positions in Bosnia. 
  Another question was addressed to Maltese Foreign Minister 
Guido De Marco. The question was this: You have been to 
Albania three times. Do you see any political and economic 
changes? He answered very categorically: Yes. I see great 
political and economic changes. This is the desire of the 
Albanian people, De Marco continued, who have reached these 
great progresses due to democracy. 
  Another question, which seemed important to us, was that 
addressed to Mr. Berisha regarding the siting of two U.S. planes 
in Albania. Berisha gave this answer to the question: We have 
cooperated and continue to cooperate with NATO, the United 
Nations, and we have signed a memorandum of cooperation in the 
military field with the United States. Berisha said there is 
nothing new, because NATO ships that patrol for any violation of 
the embargo imposed against Serbia and Montenegro have sailed, 
and continue to sail, in Adriatic waters. Thus, the setting up 
of two planes was considered by Berisha as a remarkably normal 
thing in the framework of the cooperation between Albania and 
NATO, Albania and the United Nations, and Albania and the United 
States. 
  This was a general view of the news conference that just 
ended at the Palace of Culture.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Pavel Novotny: "Crude Oil as a Weapon"] </F>
  [Text] Russia has been and will be a country where 
tomorrow means nothing at all [reference to the communist slogan 
"The country where tomorrow means yesterday"]. The country 
aggrieved by poverty and willfulness is about as close to 
stability as a pendulum clock. Regions that no one controls are 
forming regional "republics" like on an assembly line, and the 
new prime minister, Chernomyrdin, is proud of his nickname, "the 
Red Manager." 
  In this situation, the report came that there is imminent 
danger of a halt in shipments of Russian crude oil. The 
drilling enterprises are said to be in debt up to their ears, 
allegedly through the fault of the "nonpayers" from among the 
former Soviet republics. A collapse of the Russian oilmen may 
result in a halt in the supply of energy raw materials also to 
the countries that otherwise pay properly. There is almost 
nothing one can educe from the traditionally contradictory 
comments by the central bodies, except perhaps endeavors that 
the "real culprits be punished." 
  At exactly the same time, reports have been heard of 
intended 
talks between Russia and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries [OPEC]. A joint approach to the world market is to be 
the main topic on the agenda, and neither side makes any secret 
about their objective: to raise the price of oil while cutting 
production. 
  It is clearer than the sun who would be hit hardest by such 
a 
play--the former communist countries that, in the framework of 
the economic superintegration COMECON [CEMA], have oriented 
themselves toward a single source of raw materials, the Soviet 
Union. "The inseparable friendship" of the past years condemned 
the Czech and Slovak Republics to the role of a beggar for 
Russian strategic raw materials. Other postcommunist countries 
of the Central European region, which are more or less dependent 
on shipments from Russia, find themselves in a similar situation. 
  It is important that the post-November governments realized 
the danger implied by this situation. After all, nothing worse 
could happen to the Czech Republic than to get under the thumb 
of the Eastern neighbors. Therefore, it is vitally important 
for us to expedite the talks on the construction of the new 
Ingolstadt oil pipeline. The sooner it is completed, the better.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Czech Republic Challenges </F>
Western Markets by the Low Cost of Wages"] 
  [Text] Koeln am/Rhein--Because of the low production 
costs, the Czech Republic will be a significant challenger in 
the competition with Western states on the economic markets. 
The Czech Trade and Industry Minister emphasized this yesterday 
before the representatives of German economic and political 
circles in Sankt Augustin near Bonn. Dlouhy described cheap 
labor and low wages as one of the main advantages of the 
economic reform and [a reason for] the successes of Czech 
exports. At the same time, he rejected the accusations on the 
part of various Western firms that the Czech Republic carries 
out dumping exports. 
  Dlouhy spoke yesterday about the results of the economic 
transformation in the Czech Republic in Sankt Augustin, at the 
seat of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, which is close to the 
government Christian Democratic Union (CDU). He emphasized in 
his lecture that an important goal of the reform right now is 
economic growth to maintain the hitherto social consensus with 
the economic measures. The Czech Republic is approaching 
convertibility of the currency, although, according to the 
minister, it will not happen next year. 
  Dlouhy acknowledged the results of cooperation with Germany, 
which is the most important trade partner of the Czech Republic. 
The German side is the most flexible in investments and the 
foundation of joint ventures. Of the total number of joint 
ventures in the Czech Republic, approximately 30 percent are 
German-Czech enterprises. 
  Dlouhy described as an important signal for Western Europe 
the intensification of the economic cooperation within the 
framework of the Visegrad Group oriented toward a free trade 
zone. He pointed out, however, that Prague does not intend to 
politically institutionalize the collaboration of this group. 
  Minister Dlouhy also spoke in Koeln am/Rhein on the progress 
of the transformation representatives of one of the most 
influential economic associations--the Federal Alliance of 
German Industry (BDI).

<F P=106> [Article by "fr": "Money on Exceeding the Limit on the Czech </F>
Republic; Slovak Republic Clearing Account Is on the Way"] 
  [Text] Prague--The Czech National Bank [CNB] has been 
notified by the National Bank of the Slovak Republic of the 
transfer of 46.1 million ECU's, by which the margin limit on the 
mutual trade clearing account (130 million ECU's) was overdrawn 
on 31 January 1994, Ondrej Kavacek, from the CNB Press 
Department, told HOSPODARSKE NOVINY yesterday. According to the 
Treaty on Payments, the debtor must pay this amount by the 
middle of the following month at the latest--in this instance, 
15 February. The equivalent of 46.1 million ECU's, which 
Slovakia owes for January, was remitted at the end of last week 
through a foreign mediator, and it is possible that it will be 
credited to the CNB account today. 
  In the past, both the Czech and the Slovak parties have 
stated their intention to close the old clearing lot [debts 
arising prior to the currency split on 8 February 1993], which 
serves to cover claims from the time before the currency split. 
Even recently it was the main cause of the imbalance. CNB Vice 
Governor Pavel Kysilka yesterday confirmed to HOSPODARSKE NOVINY 
that, at present, the impact of the new lot [debts arising after 
the currency split] is clearly increasing. It is responsible 
for almost half the January deficit, and, according to 
HOSPODARSKE NOVINY sources, another approximately 20 million 
ECU's have been added to the Slovak deficit since the beginning 
of February. As a feasible solution to this problem, the CNB 
has proposed to expand the margin for fluctuation of the mutual 
exchange rate within the framework of the clearing to twice 10 
percent, Kysilka said. This step should be accompanied, 
however, by other measures--above all, Slovak measures. "It has 
transpired that the deficit is becoming a more permanent affair, 
and the Slovak side will have to resort to some unilateral 
measure that, in the long run, would eliminate this phenomenon. 
I have in mind such a measure--for instance, as a move in the 
exchange rate or an import surcharge," the vice governor added. 
Finance Minister Kocarnik recently definitely refused an 
unofficial proposal by the Slovak side to extend the margin 
credit by several dozen million ECU's. At present, the Czech 
Republic provides Slovakia from its state budget a credit in 
excess of 6 billion korunas by means of clearing. 
  The closing of the old lot and a modification of the Treaty 
on Payments is currently being discussed by expert groups, a 
high-ranking official at the Finance Ministry, Milan Galler, 
told HOSPODARSKE NOVINY yesterday. According to him, however, 
it has not yet been decided when this work will be concluded in 
an agreement. Because of the ongoing talks, Kysilka has not 
specified the date when the representatives of the two countries 
are to meet concerning the clearing.

<F P=106> [Article by "(hop)": "Drugs Are Mainly Smuggled Across the </F>
Czech Republic"] 
  [Text] Prague--"The Czech Republic is far behind advanced 
Western countries in drug use," declared Interior Minister Jan 
Ruml. "Nevertheless, we rank among the countries across which 
narcotic substances are smuggled. At the same time, I do not 
deny that, to a certain extent, we are also one of the target 
and production countries but certainly not to the same extent as 
West European states. It is our duty to prevent a drug 
environment being created in our country." 
  This was the interior minister's reaction to the recent 
statement by Council of Europe Secretary General Catherine 
Lalumiere that the countries of Central and East Europe provide 
a suitable setting for the activities of various narcotics 
mafias. 
  According to our information, 18.5 kilograms of heroin, just 
under 5.0 kg of cocaine, 3.0 kg of morphine, 7.0 kg of hashish, 
and 7.0 kg of amphetamines were seized in our country last year. 
Some 149 Czech citizens and 21 foreign nationals were arrested 
for producing, smuggling, and distributing narcotic and 
psychotropic substances. "Operation Bumerang," directed against 
pervitin producers in the capital and in the Kladno region, was 
one of the most successful police interventions in 1993. 
  Some 31 Czech citizens were investigated abroad last year 
for 
drug smuggling. The largest haul, 47 kg of heroin, was found on 
a Czech citizen in Amsterdam in May. Two Czech drug traffickers 
who tried to smuggle high-quality Asian heroin from Turkey to 
Western Europe last year are now awaiting trial in a Bulgarian 
prison. The payment for such a risky journey is between $10,000 
and $20,000.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev by LA </F>
LIBRE BELGIQUE correspondent in Sofia; date not given: "Sofia 
Partner for Peace"] 
  [Text] On 14 February, Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev is 
due to sign the "Partnership for Peace" offered by Bill Clinton 
to the countries of Eastern Europe as a first step toward their 
cooperation with the structures of NATO. The fact that it is 
the president himself who will be signing the document 
underlines the importance attached by Bulgaria to the European 
structures in general, as well as its desire to obtain the best 
possible guarantees for its security. 
  [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Mr. President, why has Bulgaria turned 
to 
the "Partnership for Peace?" 
  [Zhelev] Bulgaria cannot remain alienated from this 
initiative, which is attracting all the countries of Central and 
Eastern Europe, and to which Russia will also probably turn. 
For us, this initiative represents an important step towards 
full membership of NATO. Bulgaria hopes that, in time, NATO 
will transform itself into a European-Atlantic security system 
-- a pole guaranteeing security for all countries, large or 
small, in any region of Europe or the Atlantic. Naturally, 
Bulgaria cannot remain distant from this initiative in order to 
seek alternative, utopian and uncertain, guarantees for its 
national security. 
  [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Do you believe that Bulgaria could lose 
some favor with Russia by doing this? 
  [Zhelev] I do not consider such a hypothesis to be well- 
founded, for sooner or later Russia will, or should, join this 
collective security system, depending on the natural run of 
events. The European-Atlantic community itself has an interest 
in attracting Russia, which constitutes a major element of this 
very community. 
  It is not out of fear for any ambitions that the Russians 
might have that we aspire to join NATO structures. 
Bulgarian-Russian relations are traditionally friendly. If 
politicians in certain circles -- communists, neocommunists, or 
postcommunists -- regard our interest in NATO as an expression 
of our being in opposition to Russia, then it is because they 
have a poor understanding of the run of historical events. 
Russia is on the way to democratization, just as we are. 
  [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Is there agreement between the various 
political forces in Bulgaria regarding its joining the 
"Partnership" and, possibly, NATO? 
  [Zhelev] I believe that there is already a consensus on this 
matter, at least at institutional level. I have, on several 
occasions, expressed my view favoring Bulgaria's commitment to 
and membership of NATO, for our country has no alternative 
regarding its national security. The government supports the 
same policy. In our Parliament, which is the arena of the 
fiercest debates, there were only two votes against when a vote 
was taken on the declaration in favor of subscribing to the 
"Partnership" initiative. 
  [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Does the possibility of NATO air strikes 
in Bosnia constitute a threat of the conflict spreading? 
  [Zhelev] We have always emphasized that Bulgaria will not 
get 
mixed up in that conflict in any way whatsoever. Moreover, we 
want the other Balkan states and the countries bordering the 
former Yugoslavia to adopt the same principle, for we believe 
this to be a condition sine qua non for preventing the conflict 
from spreading, and avoiding another war in the Balkans. 
  We believe that the UN embargo must be strictly respected, 
because it is proving fairly effective. As for possible air 
strikes, I believe them to be an extreme measure taken by the 
United Nations with a view to lifting the siege of Sarajevo; and 
I hope that, if it has to be implemented, the United Nations 
will take account of the actual conditions on the ground to 
spare the civilian population, and only attack the military 
targets which are undermining the practical application of its 
initiatives. However, in any case, this can only be done under 
the aegis of NATO and within the context of the decisions it 
takes.

<F P=106> [Interview with Nikolay Slatinski, chairman of the National </F>
Assembly Commission for National Security, by Valeriya Vaseva; 
place and date not given: "The Bomb of Destabilization, Likely 
to Destroy Us Every Moment, Ticks in Each of Our Countries"] 
  [Excerpts] [Vaseva] Mr. Slatinski, how would you comment 
on Suleyman Demirel's letter to Zhelyu Zhelev, urging him to 
support military intervention in Sarajevo as an outcome of the 
Yugo-crisis? 
  [Slatinski] I have heard about the letter in the media, but 
have not read it. Nevertheless, it is commendable that this 
time the National Security Commission did not have to wait two 
or three weeks before learning about it. I am rather inclined 
to regard the letter as an emotional outburst on the part of the 
Republic of Turkey expressing its wishful thinking about 
Bulgaria's reaction to the problem. I shall refrain from 
drastic definitions, such as interference in our country's 
domestic affairs. Suleyman Demirel is a great and highly 
experienced politician, and as president of Turkey, he perfectly 
well realizes that it is very difficult to influence Bulgaria at 
this very moment. He is aware that President Zhelev does not 
have the necessary prerogatives for changing our foreign policy. 
  Generally speaking, I am not very pleased about such 
letters, 
but I repeat that I am not acquainted with the text. I remember 
another similar letter from the former Turkish president, and 
this is the second case. I am convinced that Bulgaria, which by 
its behavior has demonstrated that it is conducting a pragmatic 
foreign policy, does not deserve to be treated in such a manner. 
  [Vaseva] It is strange that Demirel has not sent similar 
messages to other Balkan countries, such as Greece, for example. 
Could it be a sign that the world outside does not regard our 
"categorical" stand as "unmistakably categorical?" 
  [Slatinski] It is a fact that Bulgaria is maintaining a 
passive attitude, which almost borders on coolness. I cannot 
reproach those who are in charge of our foreign policy for this 
attitude, because they are acting according to the trends and 
framework set by our parliament regarding the Balkan crisis. 
First: Bulgaria categorically supports the peaceful settlement 
of the problem. Second: Bulgaria shall not get involved in the 
conflict under any form, or under any aegis whatsoever. Third: 
Bulgaria appeals to all the neighbor countries to imitate its 
example of non-interference. Fourth: Bulgaria is in favor of 
preserving Bosnia-Herzegovina's whole territory as one single 
state. Fifth: Bulgaria is against lifting the arms embargo. 
This is what the National Assembly has declared and it 
represents the framework of our government's foreign policy, to 
which the Bulgarian president should adhere as well. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Vaseva] If, God forbid, NATO should decide to attack Serb 
positions in Bosnia -- what is awaiting us? 
  [Slatinski] This is exactly my opinion. I always think that 
the political forces could have defined their stands a little 
more precisely. I have the feeling that Bulgaria's political 
elite does not seem to have noticed the danger. I doubt that 
the decision will come through, because of Russia's stand, which 
is decisive. If NATO should still decide to take this step, the 
world is likely to become even more unpredictable. Europe's 
greatest mistake was to say that the disintegration of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is caused by ethnic reasons, and we believed 
this version. No! The disintegration was allowed to occur 
according to religious principles instead! A process which is 
very difficult to control has started and it is not quite clear 
what negative results it might involve for Bulgaria. A bomb of 
destabilization likely to destroy us all is ticking in every 
country in the area. 
  Hence, the story of Bosnia-Herzegovina is an open book, 
which 
the Bulgarian political elite should learn to read between the 
lines. It contains lessons, warnings, and conclusions that are 
directly related to Bulgaria's near future. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Synchrony must exist between the parliamentary 
group of the Rights and Freedoms Movement [DPS] and the 
government, as well as in the vertical link between the DPS 
Central Council and its parliamentary group -- this was what the 
participants in today's DPS conference decided. 
  An official proposal will be made to the deputies who left 
the DPS parliamentary group that they should leave the National 
Assembly as well. The DPS assesses the work of the government 
to date as unsatisfactory, but considers that it should wait 
until the budget is adopted before deciding the issue of what 
personnel changes in the cabinet should be proposed. 
  Here is a brief interview with DPS leader Ahmed Dogan by our 
reporter Mariya Tsankova: 
  [Begin recording] [Dogan] We support the government, we 
support it, so to speak, as its godparent, although we have a 
number of very serious critical remarks to make. However, these 
critical comments do not relate to the status of the government, 
but rather concern the possibility for more radical actions. We 
have some hopes regarding a cabinet shuffle, but Prime Minister 
Prof. Lyuben Berov is the man who has to decide this matter. 
  [Tsankova] Did you discuss a code of regulations for the DPS 
parliamentary group and the relations within it? 
  [Dogan] Yes, the subject did come up, a number of principles 
for a code were suggested. I personally proposed that the 
leadership should be rotated, the post of leader, and so on. 
  [Tsankova] Did you discuss the allegations of corruption 
that prompted Mehmet Hodja to leave the DPS parliamentary group? 
  [Dogan] I would very much like to know the facts about at 
least one case of corruption from the person who posed this 
issue. I would very much like to know one such fact, and would 
be very glad if someone could provide me with such information. 
However, if we talk about corruption in the broad sense, 
perhaps this is a matter for parliament. [end recording] 
  Discussions will no doubt be provoked by the decision 
adopted 
at today's DPS meeting to propose to the government that 
representatives of the tobacco producers appointed by local DPS 
leaderships should serve on the managements of the 22 companies 
controlled by Bulgartabak Holdings.

<F P=106> [Konstantin Subchev commentary: "Show for Naive People"] </F>
  [Text] Already for the fifth time, the Bulgarian 
parliament served up to the voters its favorite show -- a 
no-confidence vote in Professor Berov's cabinet. This is a show 
because hardly anyone would seriously consider the possibility 
of toppling the cabinet against the background of the existing 
political situation. 
  The result again showed that except for the parliamentary 
faction of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] which proposed 
the no-confidence vote, and several independent deputies, all 
other parliamentary forces firmly support the cabinet. This 
means of course, that they do not want early elections. 
  There are two reasons causing this attitude. 
  First, no one, including those who proposed the vote, is 
prepared for new elections. The Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] 
is not yet ready with its political program, which is expected 
to determine how leftist the party is. For its part the SDS has 
not shaken the hangover caused by the fall of Filip Dimitrov's 
cabinet, and is not sure whether the process of expelling 
various members has ended. Hence, the SDS boldly attacks the 
cabinet with no-confidence proposals, standing absolutely no 
risk whatsoever that the proposals will be adopted. For its 
part, the Movement for Rights and Freedoms [DPS] is not even 
sure that it can contend with the existing 4 percent minimum. 
  The second reason is of a purely personal nature. Many of 
the current 240 deputies are not sure about their place in the 
next election lists, or even whether they will figure in those 
lists. Therefore, every additional month in the life of this 
cabinet and parliament literally represents net profit for them. 
  Thus, the no-confidence votes are a pure show for naive 
voters. However, it appears that they are fed up with this show.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Defense Minister Becomes Hazard for </F>
National Security"] 
  [Text] March 1992 -- The Yugoslav Army officially 
withdraws from Macedonia. 
  September 1992 -- Defense Minister Staliyski meets 
Macedonian 
Defense Minister Professor Vlado Popovski in Skopje. The talks 
are fruitful, the Macedonian side proposes intensification of 
contacts. 
  October 1992 -- The Macedonian defense minister visits 
Bulgaria at Staliyski's invitation and has talks with Prime 
Minister Filip Dimitrov, President Zhelev, and the military 
leadership of the Defense Ministry. An agreement is reached on 
signing a framework accord on exchanging groups of experts and 
training Macedonian officers at the Georgi Rakovski Military 
Academy. 
  Minister Popovski announces that the Macedonian Army is 
armed 
only with weapons of the former Yugoslav territorial defense 
troops. In connection with certain concocted accusations by the 
leadership of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] regarding a 
deal with Bulgarian weapons for Macedonia, he says that not a 
single Bulgarian rifle sling has been imported to Macedonia. 
  November 1992 -- Bulgarian-Macedonian relations deteriorate 
after General Brigo Asparukhov's absurd statement about an "arms 
deal," and about the "pro-Serbian" attitude of the Macedonian 
Government. The Macedonian side notes that the accusations and 
violations of the embargo have hurt Bulgaria's image. 
Nevertheless, the Macedonian military proposes the formation of 
an expert commission on cooperation in the training of cadres, 
rear services, and communications equipment. 
  December 1992 -- The Macedonian military proposes an 
exchange 
of information. 
  Already in its first days the new cabinet supported by the 
Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] imposes an embargo on contacts 
with Macedonia's military representatives. In an absurd 
interview, Defense Minister Valentin Aleksandrov proposes the 
insane idea of a so-called Alliance of the Danubian States, 
while Bulgaria's policy toward Macedonia is reduced to the 
definition "sentiments." 
  The defense minister's idea on the "Danubian Alliance" has 
been implemented to the extent that today the 
Sofia-Ankara-Athens isosceles triangle has become an equilateral 
triangle.... On the other hand, the systematic betrayal of 
national interests through totally ignoring Macedonia as a 
partner in military contacts, continues. 
  An absurd situation is reached when the Macedonian deputy 
minister of defense is received by the deputy chairman of a 
department in our Defense Ministry, and the meeting takes place 
in the Defense Ministry's cafeteria!? Despite the humiliation, 
the Macedonian deputy minister accepts the meeting and proposes 
cooperation, to which the Bulgarian side reacts with silence.... 
  The attempts of highranking Macedonian military figures to 
establish contacts with Bulgarian colleagues are met with 
obvious slights. At the same time the Defense Ministry 
establishes official contacts with Albanian Defense Minister 
Safet Zhulali, Greek General Staff Chief Dhimitrios Skarvelis, 
and his Turkish counterpart, Gures. The Bulgarian military 
signs agreements with Greece and Turkey on additional measures 
on strengthening confidence and security. 
  Macedonia becomes a UN member in April 1993. The Macedonian 
minister officially declares that his Bulgarian colleague 
Aleksandrov has refused already on two occasions to meet with 
him, but despite this he is prepared to visit Bulgaria. 
Minister Popovski again declares that Bulgaria is an 
exceptionally important factor in Macedonia's national security. 
  Encountering the iron wall of Bulgarian military silence, a 
Macedonian delegation makes an official visit to Turkey in 
November 1993 and signs a cooperation agreement. In a joint 
declaration with the Turkish defense minister it is pointed out 
that in the case of a Serbian military aggression Turkey will 
interfere and guarantee Macedonia's national security. The 
Bulgarian side reacts with dead silence. 
  Two dark figures stand behind the Defense Ministry civilian 
and military leadership's unconstructive policy -- Lieutenant 
General Stoyan Andreev, until recently adviser to the president 
on national security issues, and intelligence chief Brigo 
Asparukhov. The two puppets' strings are again pulled by a 
distant northeastern capital, states a well-informed source. 
Someone is again selling our national interests and ideals 
elsewhere.

<F P=106> [Report by Colonel Vladi Vladkov and Major Krasen Buchkov: </F>
"Military Security Guarantees Play Important Role Despite 
Political Efforts for Stability"] 
  [Excerpts] The seminar on issues of national security, 
organized for journalists, was attended by Defense Minister 
Valentin Aleksandrov; General Staff Chief Army General Lyuben 
Petrov; Nikolay Slatinski, chairman of the National Assembly 
Commission on National Security; deputy ministers of defense; 
representatives of the parliament; and army generals and 
officers. [passage omitted] 
  Defense Minister Valentin Aleksandrov "maneuvered" with the 
topic he was offered, and made an "European journey" on the 
topical issues called the "Bermuda Triangle" -- relations 
between the supreme commander-in-chief, the defense minister, 
and the chief of the General Staff. According to him, at 
present the issue has been placed upon a legal foundation and 
practically resolved to a large degree. Personal ambitions and 
party interests occasionally produce sparks, which also affect 
the so-called triangle. 
  Minister Aleksandrov made an historical review of the issue 
and pointed out attempts to resolve it at the beginning of the 
century in Germany, Austro-Hungary, and Russia, and analyze the 
present situation in many Eastern and Western European 
countries. Until recently, a merging between a certain party 
and the army leadership was evident in the former states of the 
Warsaw Pact. The minister of defense said that this is the 
situation even today in some democratic countries. Colleagues 
in Germany, Austria, and France are also party members. 
However, this was dangerous at our state of democratic 
development, because if a member of any political party becomes 
the minister of defense, this could cause a politicization of 
the army. 
  In the United States, the President is also the supreme 
commander-in-chief and prime minister. The U.S. secretary of 
defense is a coordinating official, while the chairman of the 
United Chiefs of Staffs has direct access to the supreme 
commander-in- chief. This is a very good model for the 
developing democracies. 
  However, there is another model -- the Latin American one -- 
the defense minister said. There, the head of the General Staff 
could organize a coup whenever he wanted. Fortunately, we are 
far away from this model. 
  Minister Aleksandrov said that the president would find it 
very difficult to be the supreme commander-in-chief in times of 
a war if he was not a military expert. Therefore, in the case 
of war the General Staff should have broader prerogatives. 
  According to the minister of defense, the issue of the 
General Staff chief also co-signing ministerial orders was 
artificially fanned. After all, the General Staff knows the 
army and its officers best. 
  Army Gen. Lyuben Petrov, chief of the Bulgarian Army General 
Staff, greeted the idea of the Center on Training National 
Security Cadres to organize a seminar for the journalists. He 
assured the journalists that, at present, there were no problems 
between the defense minister and the General Staff chief. 
However, this must be incorporated in a law, because there was 
no guarantee that if today the things in this sphere are well, 
the situation would remain the same tomorrow, when the 
circumstances and the persons involved change. 
  Army Gen. Petrov outlined some challenges of our foreign 
policy, and certain risk factors related to the complex 
military-political situation in the Balkans. Among them he 
listed the imbalance between troops, arms, and military 
equipment that exists in the peninsula, the ethnic and religious 
conflicts, the crime rate, the drug traffic, and so on. He 
stressed that the military security guarantees will play an 
important role despite the political efforts to guarantee the 
stability. 
  The military doctrine is a system of fundamental views 
related to preventing military conflicts and defending the 
country that have been officially accepted, Army Gen. Petrov 
continued. It was developed during the last year and subjected 
to many discussions. A theoretical conference on the military 
doctrine has been conducted. The Supreme Military Council and 
the General Staff Military Council reviewed the doctrine. After 
certain corrections were inserted by the Council of Ministers, 
the doctrine was ready, and it will be submitted to the National 
Assembly. 
  The military doctrine is the conceptual foundation of both 
the military policy of our state institutions and the activity 
of the Defense Ministry and the General Staff regarding the 
armed forces' construction, training, and strategic use. The 
military doctrine is the foundation of the activity of the state 
leadership and the armed forces in guaranteeing the country's 
security. It is an open system and could be amended in 
accordance with the changes in the military-political situation 
and the strategic concepts of the state leadership, the chief of 
the Bulgarian Army General Staff said in conclusion.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The MSZP Is Leading and the Fidesz </F>
Is on the Slide"] 
  [Text] The Hungarian Gallup Institute examines the changes 
in the sympathy of the adult population toward the political 
parties regularly once a month. The data are gathered from a 
representative sample of people aged 18 and over, according to 
sex, age, and type of community. The latest survey took place 
between 28 and 31 January 1994, based on a sample of 2,000 
people. The results can be affected by sampling mistakes, and 
this reflects the difference between these results and the 
results that would be obtained if we were to ask the entire 
population. In the current survey, the margin of error is in 
the range of plus or minus 2-3 percent. The number of people 
surveyed in previous opinion polls was as follows: 5,669 in 
September 1993, 1,499 in October 1993, 994 in November 1993, and 
1,443 in December 1993. 
  The opinion poll carried out by the Hungarian Gallup 
Institute at the end of January 1994 concludes that the 
Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] is heading the popularity list. 
The proportion of potential MSZP supporters gradually increased 
in the last quarter of 1993, albeit to a small extent every 
month, and it showed a 4 percent increase in January compared 
with December. The opposite trend can be seen in the case of 
the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], the party that is 
currently in second place. Compared with September 1993, the 
number of Fidesz supporters fell by almost half. The Hungarian 
Democratic Forum [MDF], a party that almost doubled its 
percentage of supporters in the days of the funeral of its 
leader and prime minister, is currently in third place on the 
popularity list. Although the number of its supporters dropped 
by 3 percent from December to January, the MDF has not enjoyed 
such a high level of support since April 1993. The popularity 
of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] is also increasing. 
The number of potential SZDSZ voters is roughly equal to the 
number of MDF supporters, and is close to the level achieved by 
Fidesz. 
  The survey also asked the people the following question: 
"Which party would you vote for if elections were held this 
coming Sunday?" 
  About a fifth of the people (22 percent) answered "I do not 
know", and 11 percent said that they would not go to vote. 
Thus, people who support a party make up two-thirds of the 
entire population, and we will call them "people who answered." 
The size of this group was considerably smaller in one case 
only, namely during the survey carried out at the time of 
Antall's funeral. At the time, mainly as a result of an 
increase in the number of uncertain people, people with a 
specific party preference made up 60 percent of the adult 
population in Hungary. 
  The Gallup Institute also measured the people's readiness to 
vote with the help of a two-tier scale. The question was as 
follows: "The number 7 on this card means that someone is very 
sure he would vote if elections were held next Sunday. Number 6 
means that he is sure. On the other side of the card, number 1 
means that he is very sure he would not vote, and number 2 means 
that he is sure he would not vote. The other numbers represent 
the various levels between these two intentions. Where would 
you put yourself on this scale?" 
  Some 68 percent of the people interviewed in January 1994 
said that they were "very sure" or "sure" that they would vote. 
People who said they were very sure they would vote "next 
Sunday" make up the group of "certain voters." Every second 
adult Hungarian citizen was in this group in January (15 
percent). 
  The MSZP received most support from these people at the end 
of January 1994, namely 28 percent, or 10 percent more than the 
second placed Fidesz (18 percent), and roughly twice as many as 
the MDF (15 percent) and the SZDSZ (14 percent). A total of 8 
percent would have voted for the Smallholders' Party on "that 
Sunday" and a decisive number (7 percent) would have voted for 
the Independent Smallholders' Party [FKgP]. The number of 
potential voters for the Christian Democratic People's Party 
[KDNP] is similar to the FKgP supporters (7 percent). 
  Regarding the changes in party preferences, we must notice 
three elements: 1. The proportion of MSZP supporters increased 
from 22 percent in October-November to 28 percent in January; 2. 
In the same period of time, the number of Fidesz supporters 
dropped from 35 percent to 18 percent; 3. The MDF, which had 
been receiving an average of 10 percent since spring 1993, 
received 18 percent after Antall's funeral in December, and 15 
percent in January. 
  The percentages measured among the "probable" voters 
slightly 
differ from the above figures. The "sure" voters are divided 
into three groups: A third would be MSZP supporters (32 
percent); half as many would support the MDF (15 percent), the 
SZDSZ (15 percent), and the Fidesz (15 percent), and only half 
as many again would support the FKgP (7 percent) and the KDNP (7 
percent). 
  Finally, let us mention the supporters of "other" parties, 
namely non-parliamentary parties. The overall proportion of 
people supporting these parties is 9 percent and, at the moment, 
none of these parties is in a position to get into parliament.

<F P=106> [Attila Gy. Fekete report: "Orban's Key Question: Will </F>
Bekesi Beat Sandor Nagy"] 
  [Text] Viktor Orban, chairman of the Federation of Young 
Democrats [Fidesz], will also run as an individual candidate at 
the elections in Szekesfehervar's electoral district No. 1. 
This was one of the decisions at the two-day weekend meeting of 
the Fidesz's national committee. After the meeting, in an 
interview with NEPSZABADSAG, in addition to talking about 
relations between the Fidesz and the Alliance of Free Democrats 
[SZDSZ], Orban also said that the Fidesz's talks with the 
National Federation of Trade Unions in Hungary [MSZOSZ] are made 
rather difficult by the fact that [MSZOSZ Chairman] Sandor Nagy 
is ahead of Laszlo Bekesi on the Hungarian Socialist Party's 
[MSZP] national list. 
  By way of introduction, Orban repeated that the Fidesz 
members in Szekesfehervar had asked him to run in the elections 
as an individual candidate; he asked the national committe's 
support for this, which he received after some debate. Many 
members thought that by running as individual candidate, the 
party's first man can only play a smaller part in the national 
campaign and he exposes himself to unnecessary and unseemly 
attacks, and his possible failure might have a negative effect 
on the party's performance in other districts. At the same 
time, Orban thought that the British election system should be 
taken as an example, where those people who had themselves 
assessed in the campaign as individual candidates have the 
biggest chance of becoming ministers or state secretaries. 
  The Fidesz will begin the fight for mandates at different 
times and in different ways in each county. It is planning a 
brief and positive campaign whose "grand national opening" will 
be at the beginning of March. Orban said that his party 
certainly does not want to commit the same mistake as the MSZP 
-- not intending to nominate a prime ministerial candidate until 
the final results of the elections are known -- therefore, the 
Fidesz will name its prime ministerial candidate at the national 
opening of the campaign. 
  Talking about the Fidesz-SZDSZ relationship, Orban said: I 
trust that relations between the two parties will continue to be 
correct and balanced in the future, too. It is natural for 
minor or bigger conflicts to arise between two rivals, however, 
considering the election alliance, it is expedient to reduce the 
number of these conflicts to the minimum. It has to be accepted 
that the two parties can only cooperate. "According to our 
surveys, if either of the parties looked for other election 
allies or future coalition partners then it would significantly 
reduce its election chances." 
  In an interview, [Fidesz official] Tamas Deutsch said that 
certain forces in the SZDSZ would prefer cooperation with the 
MSZP to the parties of the liberal bloc. Not disputing this, 
Orban pointed out that if the SZDSZ came noticeably closer to 
the MSZP, or possibly started talks on cooperation between the 
two parties, then this would prove the claims made by the 
politicians of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] in the past 
three years. They claimed that the two parties had evolved from 
the same cultural and social roots and set rather similar goals 
for themselves. However, cooperation with the MSZP would 
destroy the SZDSZ. A significant section of the SZDSZ's 
membership joined the party at a time when it most loudly 
advocated its anti-communist views. Anyone who knows the 
provincial SZDSZ organizations is aware that rapprochement with 
the MSZP would lead to the SZDSZ's splitting into two. 
  At its congress held in Debrecen in March 1993, the Fidesz 
accepted its election program. Orban said that, in the past 
year, major changes that would require a significant adjustment 
of the program have not happened in Hungary. The party 
continuously coordinates its goals with the organizations of 
interest representation and interest protection. They will 
first talk to the representatives of employers, and they wish to 
hold discussions with the trade unions in early April. As is 
known, the chairman of the MSZOSZ, the biggest trade union 
federation, is second on the MSZP's national list. In 
connection with this, Orban said that this issue even evoked 
serious debates in the Fidesz. The party's economists claimed 
that Laszlo Bekesi's economic program was worth accepting as a 
basis for discussions. Three years ago, I said the same on this 
issue, namely that the MDF's program was full of liberal 
elements and we can see what has happend to that, Orban 
reminded. The key issue for us is whether Bekesi is before or 
after Sandor Nagy on the MSZP's list. Naturally, if Nagy is 
further forward, we still have to talk to the trade unions, but 
perhaps, in this case, not on the level of the chairman. 
  Finally, Orban said that after the elections, we have to 
expect a strengthening of the extreme right wing and radical 
right-wing forces. So far, these forces have either been part 
of the government coalition or, if they were out of it, the 
conservative government was still acceptable to them. Although 
they criticized the government regularly, they did not make 
social or economic demands on it. After 1994, the situation 
will be different; especially if the trade unions, namely the 
representatives of the employees' interests, get into Parliament 
or government through the MSZP. After this, it will be the 
radical right-wing forces, rather than the various trade unions 
that will make demands contrary to economic rationality; the 
reduction of the retirement age for example. It will be these 
forces that will radicalize the strata of society that are 
becoming poorer. 
  In reply to whether this reasoning would justify the MDF's 
participation in the next coalition, Orban said that this can 
also be a solution, but he would rather that a government 
supported by a broad coalition be established after the 
elections. It will not be possible to govern the country with a 
51 to 52 percent majority between 1994 and 1998. Anyone who 
keeps announcing with whom he is unwilling to govern is acting 
against the country's interests, he stated. A party chairman 
only acts wisely if he either does not talk about the coalition 
possibilities or, if he does, he keeps as many avenues open as 
possible.

<F P=106> [Tibor J. Keri report: "Horn: We Have More Than One </F>
Suitable Prime Ministerial Candidate"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Gyula Horn [chairman of the 
Hungarian Socialist Party, MSZP] said that a year ago they had 
asked citizens various questions: What are their views on the 
current government? What suggestions do they have to remedy the 
social and economic problems? Whom would they welcome in the 
new parliament and government? In 1993, the social dialogue 
continued and the party's expert program was drawn up. At the 
same time, the MSZP began to select its individual candidates in 
1993, in which the local organizations's views were most 
decisive. The same principles were used when the county lists 
were drawn up. The party's national organizations only had the 
right to express their views but could not directly influence 
the selection. [passage omitted] 
  Horn admitted that the MSZP's national list was drawn up 
after fierce debates. He said that the place of Laszlo Bekesi 
and others were also debated. According to Horn, "it is very 
difficult to form a view on people because everyone is bound to 
be biased to a certain extent." As for Bekesi, he is a 
distinguished representative of the MSZP and has a determining 
role in the party's economic policy, Horn said. On the national 
list, even according to the original suggestion, Bekesi was 
ahead of many leaders of the party. However, the fact that he 
now is on the third place of the draft national list was a 
result of the discussions. "This is one of the ways in which we 
expressed the importance of economic policy and of Bekesi," Horn 
said, who considers internal debates in the party perfectly 
natural. Answering our question, he said that he could even 
imagine Bekesi as the MSZP's prime ministerial candidate, but it 
will not be up to Horn to decide this. [passage omitted] 
  The Socialists have many times stated that they did not want 
to tie themselves down before the elections. "In other words, 
we are open to all democratic forces and at our congress [at the 
end of February] we wish to draw up the conditions for opening 
subsequent talks on forming a government, if the MSZP gets into 
this position," Horn said. He also explained that in this view, 
Hungary does not need a chancellor type prime minister because 
it is very likely that a number of parties will jointly form the 
next government. If the parties decide in advance who the 
members and the leader of the government should be, then it will 
be very difficult to reach a coalition agreement. He added 
that, rather than insisting on posts, the MSZP wants the best 
representatives of the given area to be in the positions. 
Therefore, these people will not necessarily come from the 
coalition parties. [passage omitted] 
  To the assumption that, even in case of a successful 
election 
performance, the MSZP would find Gabor Kuncze, prime ministerial 
candidate of the Alliance of Free Democrats, suitable as prime 
minister, and the Socialists would occupy the key ministerial 
positions, Horn said that Kuncze is not the MSZP's prime 
ministerial candidate but they are open even to him. However, 
all this depends on the election results and the coalition 
talks, he added. 
  About the danger of the so-called left-wing bloc, Horn said 
that some form of election cooperation between left-wing parties 
is natural in all democratic countries. However, this is not 
the case in Hungary, he stated. The MSZP does not wish to work 
together with the Social Democratic Party of Hungary [MSZDP] or 
the Labor Party. "In the past four years, we have not had any 
contact with the MSZDP and, as for the Labor Party, we have not 
even talked to each other," he said. Therefore, everything that 
is said about the danger of the left-wing bloc is mere 
speculation and has nothing to do with reality, Horn confirmed.

<F P=106> ["J.I.B."-initialled report: "The MSZP's Foreign Policy </F>
Program -- It Urges Conciliation With Our Neighbors"] 
  [Text] With the approach of the elections, one after the 
other, the parties are publishing their foreign policy programs, 
and UJ MAGYARORSZAG tries to outline these as they appear. 
  Establishing and preserving balanced relations with our 
neighbors is one of the main directions of the Hungarian 
Socialist Party's [MSZP] efforts. Promoting historical 
conciliation with those neighboring countries with which 
Hungary's relations have become tense is the most urgent task, 
Laszlo Kovacs, chairman of the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs 
Committee, member of the MSZP's national committee, and the 
MSZP's foreign affairs spokesman said at an expert debate on the 
MSZP's foreign policy program organized by the party's Central 
and Eastern Europe Section on 10 February. The program states 
that it is expedient to sign a basic agreement with Slovakia and 
Romania as soon as possible, and work has to begin on placing 
Hungarian-Serbian relations on new foundations. We have to 
continue to extend our relations with Croatia and Slovenia and, 
in the case of Ukraine, further efforts are needed to achieve 
practical results after the issue of national minority rights 
was settled in an exemplary way in an agreement. 
  According to the program prepared by Kovacs, guaranteeing 
the 
country's security is the primary goal of Hungarian foreign 
politics; foreign policy also has to ensure that Hungarian 
intentions are not viewed with suspicion. From the point of 
view of regional stability, the MSZP finds it indispensable that 
an effective supervisory mechanism be established within the 
framework of the Council of Europe, and that sanctions be 
defined that are to be used if the norms defined as conditions 
for Council of Europe membership are violated. 
  It is Hungary's obligation to promote through all suitable 
means, and by avoiding measures that are open to 
misinterpretation by our neighbors, that the individual and 
collective rights of the Hungarian national minority living 
beyond the border are constitutionally guaranteed, and that they 
prevail in practice. Out of the region's countries not 
neighboring Hungary, we have to pay special attention to Russia. 
The MSZP considers it essential that NATO plays a role in 
establishing the region's stability, and in the MSZP's view, 
this stability would be best served by giving identical security 
guarantees to all countries in the region, Kovacs emphasized. 
  It was stated at the debate that, as a matter of fact, after 
1990, Hungary's scope for maneuver in the area of foreign 
politics has been greatly extended. According to Kovacs, we 
also have to see that certain developments have been unfavorable 
for the government: Hungary's original advantage has ceased to 
exist, and it is also a fact that governments that are unable to 
cope with the economic and social problems tend to divert the 
dissatisfaction in the direction of some kind of domestic or 
foreign "enemy." 
  Therefore, according to the socialists, Hungarian foreign 
policy cannot be one-sidedly made responsible for the increased 
tension around the country. However, ambiguous statements, the 
expressions of a sense of mission that aggravate the neighbors, 
the frequent repetition of historical grievances, and the 
occasional emergence of irredentist behavior in the government 
parties have all further fueled the tensions -- this is how 
Kovacs summed up the Antall- government's foreign policy. In 
his view, it was a general mistake to ignore the need for 
harmony between the priorities, namely Western integration, the 
establishment of adequate relations with the neighbors, and 
improving the situation of the national minorities.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Lajos Fur, nominee for the </F>
position of chairman of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, by Zsolt 
Mester; place and date not given: "Unsatisfied Masses Could 
Become Toys in the Hands of Demagogues"] 
  [Text] Defense Minister Lajos Fur is the only serious 
candidate for the position of chairman of the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum [MDF], and this fact is not kept secret even by 
the leading figures in the MDF. In his interview with PESTI 
HIRLAP prior to the seventh national conference of the MDF 
scheduled for the coming weekend, Lajos Fur spoke about his 
ideas, his party's internal situation, and the advance of the 
left which, in his view, is the most dangerous political force. 
  [Mester] You are regarded as the only serious candidate for 
the position of MDF chairman. Sandor Lezsak stepped down but he 
continues to accept gladly the position of executive chairman, a 
position that has been necessary so far because the party 
chairman was also the prime minister. Now, Peter Boross is the 
MDF's candidate for the position of prime minister. If things 
turn out the way you envisage, what kind of division of labor 
will you develop with Sandor Lezsak? 
  [Fur] There is no need for the previous division of labor to 
change. It is the task of the executive chairman to deal with 
organizational and administration matters, and this can continue 
in the future because, even if not a prime minister, I am still 
a minister and I have a lot of government tasks to see to. It 
is the task of the MDF chairman to represent the party outside. 
As part of this effort, I will continue to visit various places 
in Hungary if the upcoming national conference assigns this task 
to me, just like now, for the benefit of keeping contact with 
the members. 
  [Mester] It seems that, after Istvan Csurka and his 
followers, a new internal opposition is emerging in the party. 
Based on his declarations, Ivan Szabo and the national liberals 
seem to be part of this opposition. 
  [Fur] I do not think that they are emerging as an internal 
opposition. National liberalism has its own justification and 
place within the MDF, along with the other two main trends, of 
course, on condition that it refrains from trying to become the 
exclusive trend, but nothing like this is happening. 
  [Mester] One of the liberals, Ferenc Kulin, is the first MDF 
leader in a top position who used to be member of the Hungarian 
Socialist Workers Party [MSZMP]. 
  [Fur] This has no special importance whatsoever. 
  [Mester] At a meeting of the MDF organization in Zuglo 
[Budapest district], you spoke about the leftist danger 
threatening Hungary. It seems that you regard the left as the 
most dangerous election rival, and you are afraid of possible 
restoration of old ways. The left has repeatedly criticized you 
for such statements. 
  [Fur] I continue to declare that the danger can be clearly 
shown by scientific means. The extremist dictatorship of the 
past four decades has not disappeared without any trace; it has 
penetrated the society and it is present as an extremely 
organized force that can be mobilized any time. It is also 
present in the people's thinking and mentality: Although 
everyone knew that the communists were lying when they spoke 
about equality, people who are now living under difficult 
conditions and struggling with various problems are weeping for 
the return of the period of "equality." The danger of 
restoration is real: History proves that it is possible to make 
a dictatorship out of democracy, by democratic means; take the 
example of Germany between 1929 and 1933 or Hungary between 1945 
and 1948. 
  [Mester] The election campaign has clearly started, and the 
MDF does not have an appointed campaign manager to this very 
day. I know that the general answer to this is that the 
executive chairman and his staff are directing the election 
campaign. You have not yet finished your election program 
either, although almost every party has already come up with 
some program. It is true that Sandor Lezsak said earlier that 
the MDF was focusing on the work to be done, and not on the 
campaign; in other words, the MDF is engaged in the electoral 
campaign by working. However, not long ago, the MDF group in 
the National Assembly suggested the earliest date for Parliament 
to end its activity.... Are you late with the work? 
  [Fur] Not at all. The division of labor of the executive 
body is adequate; its members have specific tasks and they have 
been working on them for a long time. The national conference 
will formulate and approve the election program; the 
preparations have been made and the draft is ready. At the same 
time, the campaign of individual candidates has been going on 
all over the country for weeks and months. As for the proposal 
of the parliamentary group, the date of end of March or the 
beginning of April is realistic, especially if we consider the 
candidates of the Dunantul region, with 60-80 small villages in 
their electoral district. Sandor Lezsak's previous statement is 
still valid: Tough work is awaiting us in Parliament until the 
beginning of the election campaign. There is a lot of work to be 
done.

<F P=106> ["M.L.L."-signed report: "SZDSZ: Balanced Foreign Policy </F>
Program"] 
  [Text] Foreign policy is a special area where the ideas of 
the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] and the Hungarian 
Socialist Party [MSZP] stand closest to each other, [SZDSZ 
foreign policy expert and deputy chairman of the Parliamentary 
Foreign Affairs Committee] Istvan Szent-Ivanyi admitted at a 
news conference on 11 February. The MSZP's foreign policy 
program is "not typical of the party" in the sense that it is 
free of the ambiguities that can be seen in the economic and 
domestic political ideas. Anyway, the SZDSZ that has been 
balanced all the time will not change something purely because 
others also think similarly, Szent-Ivanyi added when he spoke 
about the party's foreign political program. 
  He said that the idea of European integration, security 
policy, and politics relating to the neighbors that includes 
national minority policy as an organic part are the three basic 
pillars of the program. The SZDSZ has managed to keep the three 
issues in balance all along. The government's foreign policy 
can be criticized precisely because the proportions have shifted 
and the situation of the Hungarians living beyond the border has 
been given a primary role. It can be said that the government's 
foreign policy is bad compared to what it could have achieved. 
Starting from a favorable position, it realized little of the 
actual possibilities. 
  On the issue of joining Europe, Szent-Ivanyi pointed out 
that, in the views of his party, rather than setting "magic 
deadlines," the goals have to be implemented as soon as the 
country's and the economy's condition facilitate it; haste would 
only cause harm. For this reason, in his view, the government 
should not, as a campaign measure, overhastily submit its 
request to the European Union. 
  In the area of security policy, he emphasized that, in 
addition to urging foreign guarantees, we mainly have to 
strengthen our domestic efforts. This proposal does not mean 
increasing the military force. A balanced and internationally 
respected attitude, domestic stability, the development of the 
democratic institutional system, and the improvement of the 
economy are more important factors. 
  As for the policy concerning the neighboring countries, the 
SZDSZ expects a slow progress and the basic agreements would 
only move the processes from their deadlock at the most. These 
agreements are not products that can be sold and bought; the 
party clearly states that the borders cannot be changed but this 
can only be included in agreements together with other 
guarantees. We must not give up the collective rights of 
national minorities, but unutilized reserves also exist in the 
area of individual rights. The elimination of dual taxation, 
investment protection, new cultural and scientific agreements, 
and the opening of new border crossing points would increase the 
confidence of the neighbors. 
  It is generally true that the establishment of a modernized, 
attractive, democratic, and stable Hungary is a precondition to 
implementing the concept, Szent-Ivanyi told NEPSZABADSAG. Also 
speaking to our newspaper, he said that the changes in the 
foreign affairs staff (which affected about half of the 
diplomatic staff) often had political motivations. If the SZDSZ 
came to power, it would only initiate the change of ambassadors 
in 15 to 20 cases at the most. 
  Talking about integrated foreign representations, 
Szent-Ivanyi noted that the economic diplomacy tasks of the 
Ministry for International Economic Relations [NGKM] could be 
drawn under the authority of foreign affairs, the licensing 
functions could be transferred to the Industry and Trade 
Ministry, and the services to the chamber [not sepcified] or the 
National Federation of Entrepreneurs [VOSZ]. Szent-Ivanyi noted 
the deficit of the foreign affairs budget which might result in 
the apparatus becoming unable to function by the end of this 
year unless a supplementary budget is made.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Ion Iliescu at dinner in honor of </F>
Franjo Tudjman, president of the Republic of Croatia, in 
Bucharest on 14 February -- recorded] 
  [Text] Mr. President Franjo Tudjman, esteemed guests: 
  I take this opportunity to express again my great pleasure 
of 
welcoming you to Romania. I recall with satisfaction my visit 
to the Republic of Croatia in the spring of 1993 and the 
understandings and agreements concluded on that occasion. Those 
agreements have inaugurated an important stage in the 
development of bilateral relations and facilitated a better 
knowledge of our cooperation possibilities and of the stands 
promoted by our countries in connection with various 
international matters, particularly with regard to the efforts 
to find a political solution to put an end to the conflict in 
the area of former Yugoslavia. 
  Mr. President, your visit to Romania opens new prospects for 
the development of cooperation between our countries and for the 
implementation of the political desire expressed by both sides 
to promote a fruitful long-term cooperation. The Treaty of 
Friendship and Cooperation that we will sign as well as the 
other cooperation accords that will be finalized during your 
current visit are proof of this will of our two countries and 
also create the necessary premises for the implementation of 
this will. We are close countries, situated in the same region. 
Consequently, we are objectively interested in developing ever 
more substantial ties in the political, economic, and cultural 
fields. 
  Mr. President, the situation in the region is a handicap for 
the establishment of normal relations at the bilateral or 
multilateral level. The armed conflict, the immense loss of 
human lives, the huge material destruction, and the drama of the 
refugees represent an unacceptable situation vis-a-vis the 
aspirations for peace, better life, and democracy which have 
animated the nations in this part of Europe after the 
liquidation of the totalitarian communist system. 
  Both of us are fully experiencing the effects of the 
embargo, 
at a time when our economies, which are in a period of 
transition, are least prepared to support them, particularly 
since there are no compensations. But then, we do not expect 
anyone to compensate us for our huge economic losses incurred as 
a result of the observation of the sanctions imposed by the 
United Nations. The best compensation for us is a speedy 
normalization of the situation in the former Yugoslav area. The 
deadlocked peace negotiations, the risk of possible air strikes 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the latest trend toward further 
escalation confirm the imperious need for all parties involved 
to renounce all confrontation, to end the fighting and military 
actions, and to show maximum responsibility with a view to 
finding a political solution to the conflict. 
  Even before the start of the armed conflict, Romania spoke 
out for a political solution to the Yugoslav crisis. We are 
convinced that no effort should be spared to end the armed 
confrontations and agree on some appropriate settlements, which 
should reflect and observe the interests of all sides involved. 
In this spirit, we welcomed the recent accord between Croatia 
and FRY, as an important and essential step toward a political 
solution, as well as the recent tentative moves toward easing 
tension in Sarajevo, which can facilitate an understanding 
between the three sides on a political solution regarding the 
future of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  We are convinced that, thanks to the ties of friendship and 
cooperation which Romania maintains with all the successor 
states of former Yugoslavia, we are making a contribution -- 
alongside of the efforts of the international community -- to 
restoring stability and a climate of trust among these states 
and ensuring security and peace in this part of Europe, where we 
are living. In this peaceful endeavor, no effort is futile. 
  Allow me to raise my glass to the development of Romanian- 
Croatian relations and to the well-being and peace of our two 
nations. To your health, Mr. President, and to the health of 
the distinguished guests.

<F P=106> [Toast by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman at dinner given </F>
in his honor by Romanian President Ion Iliescu in Bucharest on 
14 February -- recorded, in Croatian with superimposed 
translation into Romanian] 
  [Text] Esteemed Mr. President, Excellencies, ladies and 
gentlemen: 
  I want to express thanks for the warm welcome on behalf of 
the Croatian delegation and on behalf of myself. 
  Esteemed Mr. President, your visit to Croatia in June last 
year paved the way and laid the bases for friendship and 
cooperation between democratic Croatia and Romania. 
  We in Croatia attach particular importance to developing 
many- sided relations with Romania, because Romania is the 
biggest state in South-East Europe and plays an important role 
in the international order on European soil. 
  As early as your visit to Zagreb, we signed accords. We will 
finalize accords at the economic, scientific-technical level, 
and our friendship accord in Bucharest today and tomorrow. 
  Our countries have experienced the same circumstances with 
the disintegration of communist socialism in the past four 
years. This has given birth to similar problems in other areas 
as well. 
  In exchange, we in Croatia are facing problems linked to the 
disintegration of communist Yugoslavia, because we have not been 
able to overcome the crisis peacefully; and we have also 
experienced the war and we are still concerned with the war in 
Bosnia- Herzegovina. We would like this crisis in former 
Yugoslavia, which emerged together with Tito's disappearance 
from the scene of history, to be solved in a peaceful way. You 
probably know that Tito was able to renew Yugoslavia, which was 
dismantled in World War Two, due to domestic ethnic 
contradictions, for Yugoslavia was not made up only of peoples 
with differing ethnic individualities, but also of people who 
belong to different civilizations. 
  Tito succeeded in renewing Yugoslavia through setting up a 
federation that ensured full equality for its peoples. This 
lasted as long as he lived. After he died, there was a tendency 
to create a centralized state in which hegemonic tendencies 
would have been repeated, something that gave birth to a crisis 
and separatist demands. 
  We wanted to solve this crisis in a peaceful way by 
proposing 
that Yugoslavia be reorganized on the basis of a confederation. 
Unfortunately, this was not accepted. Slovenia, Croatia, and 
Macedonia proclaimed their independence. Bosnia-Herzegovina 
followed suit. Then Serb aggression against Croatia and against 
Bosnia-Herzegovina followed. The Yugo-communist army occupied 
one third of Croatia's territory and now one fourth of Croatia's 
territory is under the protection of UN peacekeeping forces, 
but, in fact, the power is under Serbian occupation. 
  The whole world, the international community, the European 
Union, the United Nations, and the Security Council have 
recognized through their resolutions that these territories 
belong to Croatia. We want to return these territories to 
Croatia in a political, peaceful, and democratic fashion. For 
this purpose, we have signed an accord on normalizing relations 
with the Yugoslav Government. We hope that all our efforts, 
with the help of the international community and your help, will 
yield results. 
  The crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina is one of the most 
complicated throughout the world, not only in South-East Europe. 
We must not forget that World War I began in Sarajevo. Now a 
European, a world war, and war between civilizations could also 
be triggered if we do not contain this situation. There are 
volunteers on both sides, on the Serb side and the Muslim one. 
  The crisis in Bosnia has been prolonged because the 
international community, Europe, and the United States, as well 
as the United Nations, did not share the same viewpoints on how 
to solve the crisis and to halt the war. For the first time in 
history, the great forces of Europe were on the same side. They 
agreed to give an ultimatum to the Serbs who are besieging the 
city of Sarajevo. We hope that the Serbs will agree to withdraw, 
that they will accept a political solution, and that the Muslims 
will follow suit. 
  Croatia has favored and continues to favor an end to this 
war, and a political solution. I want to stress with 
satisfaction that during the talks with President Iliescu and 
the Romanian delegation we arrived at the conclusion that we 
have to make joint efforts to bring about this peace. The war 
and sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia harm not only the countries 
in former Yugoslavia and Yugoslavia itself, but also neighboring 
countries, and thus Romania, and this is reason enough to seek a 
peaceful solution. The war and crisis in Bosnia have reached 
their climax. They may even expand. Through joint efforts, 
however, we would be able to solve this situation. 
  I am convinced that the visit paid to friendly Romania and 
our talks will contribute to expanding bilateral relations. 
  I want to conclude by toasting your health, Mr. President 
Iliescu, the prosperity of the Romania people, and peace.

  [Excerpts] This morning at 0700 the trade unions 
affiliated with the Targu Jiu Lignitul Mining Trade Union 
Federation stopped work. [passage omitted] 
  This information was confirmed by Vasile Chirculescu, 
director of production at the Targu Jiu Brown Coal Mining 
Corporation, who also added that, quote, the strike has no legal 
basis, as it is taking place in the town's center and not in the 
miners' workplace, unquote. 
  Miron Cosma, the chairman of the Confederation of Romania's 
Mining Trade Unions, who arrived in Targu Jiu at about 0900, 
made a statement to our correspondent saying that the principal 
reason behind the strike is the financial blockage, that is, the 
fact that the mining industry has been not paid debts of almost 
200 billion lei. Another reason is the fact that during the 
[January] talks with the prime minister, he hinted at the fact 
that by 12 February all problems would be solved. However, 
nothing has been done until now, and the promised dialogue in 
connection with this labor conflict has not taken place either, 
Cosma asserted, adding that the government and the Gorj County 
Direction of Labor and Social Protection have violated the law 
by avoiding negotiations with the trade unions. According to 
Cosma, the strike that began today will be stopped only if a 
governmental delegation comes to Targu Jiu and signs a protocol 
offering guarantees for strikers' demands to be met. 
  At this hour several hundred miners from the Gorj County 
coal 
mining units have gathered in the courtyard of the Targu Jiu 
Brown Coal Mining Public Corporation. They are to be joined 
later by employees of mining units in Valcea and Mehedinti 
counties, reports our correspondent Titus Stoichitoiu. 
  In connection with the demands expressed by the Lignitul 
Mining Trade Union Federation, State Secretary Octavian 
Partenie, specially authorized government representative for 
relations with the trade unions and employers, pointed out the 
following things to our correspondent: The indexation of 
salaries, the increase in the reference fund on the basis of 
efficiency parameters, and the possibility of negotiating 
salaries on the basis of performance criteria have been 
partially solved by a draft decision that is to be presented to 
the government later this week. 
  The decision regarding salary indexations will also contain 
the text upon which the government has already agreed with the 
trade unions. The main problem, namely the issue of the 
financial blockage of the entire economy of the country, has 
been discussed by the executive over the past several weeks and 
they are trying to solve that problem. The brown coal mining 
corporation is not facing any difficulty in paying salaries and 
other payments to its employees or to pay its taxes and fees to 
the state budget, Partenie said.

<F P=106> [Article by Bogdan Chirieac: "The Price of Partnership?"] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, at the NATO headquarters in Brussels, 
Romania, represented by Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu, was 
the first of all the East European countries to sign the 
much-discussed Partnership for Peace. Thus began the competition 
whose prize is admission to the Atlantic Alliance. Officially, 
it was stated that all six East European countries had equal 
chances in the starting line. In reality, judging only on the 
basis of the agenda of the meetings of President Clinton during 
his recent visit to Europe, this is not the case. Indisputably, 
the Czech Republic starts out a big favorite. It is a small 
country in the heart of Europe, a champion of reform, without 
any disputes with its neighbors and a favorite of Western 
investors. Close by, there is Poland, which, despite its leftist 
government and and economic difficulties, continues to have a 
strong and, especially, a "faithful" diaspora, both literally 
and figuratively. Paradoxically, Hungary, the country with the 
best image in the Western media, starts off with a big handicap. 
The strong point of the Budapest government, the exacerbation of 
the issue of the respecting of the rights of the Hungarian 
minorities dispersed in Romania or Slovakia, has given some 
trouble to the Western offices. In the competition for admission 
to NATO, the "minority issue" has proven to be a two-edged 
sword. Probably believing that one Yugoslavia is enough for 
Europe at the end of the century, the West seems to have closed 
the door to Hungarian diplomacy. Budapest's control over the 
ethnic parties on the territory of other states and the 
temptation to advocate autonomy, including territorial autonomy, 
of the zones controlled by these states have been viewed with 
alarm by Western politicians. Without being obliged to use 
diplomatic language any more, former U.S. Secretary of State 
James Baker recently stated, in plain and clear language, that 
"Hungary cannot be admitted to NATO since it supports separatist 
manifestations in Romania and Slovakia." As they say, he who 
sows the wind.... 
  At any rate, favorites or outsiders, the competition remains 
open for any result. The winner will be the one who will be 
ready to make the most sacrifices. Human sacrifices. 
Participation in the peacekeeping forces as stipulated for the 
partnership can mean loss of human life, in addition to training 
and review. In Bosnia, the Americans do not want to send ground 
troops, and the French, frightened by the losses suffered, will 
soon be withdrawing their soldiers. What East European state 
will agree to put its troops into the battle of elite Serbian, 
Croatian, or Muslim marksmen? Material sacrifices. The alignment 
of Eastern weapons with NATO military standards is also 
envisioned in the partnership. In order to reach the Western 
military high tech level, the East European countries would have 
to invest billions of dollars each year. And this is in a 
situation in which Romania, for example, which, prior to 1989, 
had an arms industry which covered 60 percent of the foreign 
debt, found, in 1994 [as published] only enough resources to 
satisfy 2 percent of the technical conditions for arms orders. 
  To ensure that the signature of Mr. Melescanu in Brussels 
does not remain a dead letter, the key issue is the pragmatic 
treatment in Bucharest of the demands of the Partnership for 
Peace. Because, even if the genuine desire of Bucharest to win 
the competition cannot be disputed, one might discover that the 
price which must be paid is not small.

  [Text] Belgrade, February 14 (TANJUG) -- The Foreign 
Ministry of the Republic of Serb Krajina (RSK) on Monday sent to 
all diplomatic and consular missions in Belgrade a note warning 
that the NATO ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs was based on false 
premises. 
  On February 9, the NATO council threatened to launch air 
strikes against the Bosnian Serbs unless they withdrew their 
heavy artillery 20 kilometres from the centre of Sarajevo within 
ten days. 
  The unprovoked ultimatum is based on two false premises, the 
first being that the Bosnian Serbs are responsible for the 
massacre in Sarajevo on February 5 and the second that the 
Bosnian Serb Army is keeping Sarajevo under siege, the RSK 
ministry said in the note, which also includes a declaration of 
the RSK Parliament on solidarity with the Serbs in the former 
Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina adopted on Saturday. 
  All well-meaning people have realised that only the Moslem 
authorities in that part of the city could have caused the 
explosion, the note says. 
  "The untruth that Sarajevo is under a Serb seige has been 
fostered over the past two years by the Western media and it now 
seems beyond question. The truth, however, is different because 
the city is actually divided on Serb and Moslem parts which are 
both contiguous to their respective states," the RSK Foreign 
Ministry said in the note. 
  The RSK authorities and Army see NATO's ultimatum as a 
hostile act also against the RSK, which is ready to help the 
Bosnian Serb Republic in its defence from a possible aggression, 
it said. 
  The RSK was proclaimed in 1991 in the Serb-populated areas 
within the administrative borders of the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Croatia in response to Croatia's secession from the 
former Yugoslav Federation and the attempt to downgrade the 
status of the Serbs from that of the constituent people to that 
of an ethnic minority. 
  In March 1992, the RSK territory was proclaimed a United 
Nations Protected Area (UNPA).

<F P=106> [Commentary by Aleksandar Milosevic: "Boban"] </F>
  [Text] A change of policy or a change of players? This 
question has been asked by many people after information reached 
us from Livno that Mate Boban had laid down the presidential 
mandate of the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna. There had 
been rumors about Boban's resignation for a long time, but no 
one expected that it would happen that dramatically. Boban 
publicly announced his resignation at the end of his speech in 
the extraordinary session of the chamber of counties of the 
parliament of the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna. His 
decision was neither voted for nor was it discussed very much. 
The information that the duties of the president will be 
performed by a collective body -- the presidential council -- 
confirms that Mate Boban is not the first man in Herceg-Bosna 
any longer. 
  The fact that the chamber of representatives of the 
parliament of Herceg-Bosna adopted in its session in Livno the 
declaration that confirmed the present politics and the attitude 
that a sovereign Croatian state in the future union of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina would be the optimal solution to the Croatian 
national problem in this area made the confusion caused by 
Boban's resignation even worse. 
  Boban's resignation can also be discussed in the light of 
the 
meeting held in Sarajevo, in which -- regardless of the 
legitimacy of its participants -- the idea about Herceg-Bosna as 
the only possible solution to the Croatian problem in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina was rejected. Most of the participants in 
the Livno meeting denied the Sarajevo meeting participants the 
right to speak on behalf of the Croats who live both in Bosnia 
and in Herzegovina, but nothing more than that was done. 
  That is why many people are ready to conclude that Boban's 
resignation is a sign of a certain turn in the politics of those 
Croats who have so far supported the idea of Herceg-Bosna as the 
only possible option. The basic elements of this option will 
probably not be changed, but it is obvious that other proposals 
might also be accepted. We have to see Boban's resignation in 
that light. The space for new ideas has been created, although 
it is obvious that the two Croatian options -- the one in Bosnia 
and the other in Herzegovina -- cannot come closer soon. 
  We have to wait for the international political factors to 
act and see how they will assess the resignation of the Croatian 
leader of the republic of Herceg-Bosna. If we can judge by the 
contacts Mile Akmadzic has had so far on behalf of Herceg-Bosna, 
there are good prospects for future negotiations.

<F P=106> [Article by Ivan Martin: "Relation of Forces"] </F>
  [Text] The Muslim media have for days been reporting on the 
"shelling of the still free parts of Mostar" by the Croatian 
Defense Council and the Croatian Army. Military sources of the 
Croatian Defense Council have, on the other hand, been reporting 
on the constant activity of Muslim snipers and gunners at Mostar 
streets, schools, and buildings. The UN Protection Force and 
military observers are counting mines and shells; dead and 
wounded are counted, too -- civilians, children, and soldiers 
alike on both sides. General Ante Roso, head of the Croatian 
Defense Council Headquarters, protested against the UN 
Protection Forces because of the shelling of civilian targets, 
which caused the deaths of children. Several days later, 
General Jean Cot wrote to General Roso about the shelling of 
Mostar and asked him to stop the action. 
  The demarcation line in Mostar has remained almost unchanged 
since 30 June 1993, when Muslim forces, supported by the units 
of the Croatian Defense Council consisting of soldiers of Muslim 
nationality, occupied the "Tihomir Misic" Barracks and the 
largest part of Bijelo Polje. Since that time, there have been 
clashes for the preservation of positions, mostly at the level 
of provocations. Muslim forces tried to occupy Buna on three 
occasions, with the aim of starting an offensive in the 
direction of Stolac, but they were forced to withdraw because of 
heavy losses. The attempt to occupy Hum also meant a tragic end 
for Izetbegovic's soldiers. The Croatian Defense Council units 
on several occasions succeeded in seizing several well-fortified 
buildings on Ricina (Santic) Street in the center of Mostar. 
  According to some objective assessments, there are 
6,000-7,000 soldiers in the 4th Corps of Izetbegovic's army in 
Mostar. Most of them have been recruited among refugees from 
eastern Herzegovina and eastern Bosnia and are armed with 
weapons they obtained or "borrowed" from the Croatian Defense 
Council. These are infantry weapons, including mortars, 
recoilless rifles, and single-barreled rocket launchers; they do 
not have heavy artillery guns. It is highly probable that they 
have recently bought mostly ammunition and certain weapons. On 
the other side, there are Croatian Defense Council units, who 
are much better armed and have much more ammunition but cannot 
(and do not have to) keep as many soldiers on the Mostar front 
as the Muslims. 
  It is only logical to ask why the Croatian Defense Council 
has not completely occupied Mostar in the past nine months. Why 
has this stalemate position -- in which the Croatian Defense 
Council is losing its people -- not been resolved yet? 
  There are various theories about it, but the most probable 
is 
the one that says that it is a political issue. Taking into 
consideration the information on the number of soldiers that can 
be engaged on both sides, on the weapons the parties to the 
conflict have, and on the much more favorable positions the 
Croatian Defense Council units have, it is certain that the 
Muslims would be defeated according to any military law should 
it be decided to take Mostar. The only question is how long the 
Muslims could offer resistance, since many Muslim soldiers are 
ready to leave Mostar and the unbearable life in isolation and 
poverty. 
  The striking force of the Muslim army are refugees from 
eastern Herzegovina, who are more than aware of the fact that it 
is almost certain they will never be able to return to their 
homes. This makes them the most radical element in the Muslim 
army. The local Muslims could make an agreement with Croats, 
although this would not be easy. On the other hand, it has 
become evident that "foreigners" play an important role among 
the Muslims in Mostar. This is proven by the fact that two 
Muslims from Sandzak joined the negotiations in Medjugorje, but 
the Croatian Defense Council representative did not want to 
negotiate with them, so the first negotiators returned. 
  The Serbian soldiers situated on the slopes of Velez 
Mountain 
are observing everything and are waiting for an outcome. They 
do not know when or if they will interfere in the 
Muslim-Croatian conflict.

Diplomacy Mistakes"] 
  [Text] Had the Lasva Valley, the Croatian enclave in 
central Bosnia, fallen into the hands of the Muslim army during 
their Christmas offensive, Haris Silajdzic, Bosnian (Muslim) 
prime minister, would not have sent the letter of accusation to 
the United Nations in which he asked for sanctions against the 
Republic of Croatia for the alleged participation of its army in 
clashes in Bosnia-Herzegovina alongside the Bosnian Croats. The 
European Union and UN mechanisms that put the issue of a 
possible introduction of economic sanctions against Croatia on 
the agenda would not have been set in motion. Silajdzic 
mentioned 10,000 to 12,000 members of the "regular Croatian 
Army" in Bosnia-Herzegovina, whereas UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali mentioned 3,000 to 5,000 Croatian Army members in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in a letter to the UN Security Council 
chairman dated 2 February 1994. Apart from that, Butrus-Ghali 
also wrote that, at the beginning, Croatian Army soldiers, 
mostly groups of volunteers, directly supported the Croatian 
Defense Council [HVO] with equipment and weapons, and concluded: 
"Since the offensive of the army of the government of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina grew stronger, it seems that the number of 
Croatian soldiers has increased." 
  Butrus-Ghali did not mention in his report that this 
offensive of the "government forces" expelled approximately 
120,000 Croats from their homes in central Bosnia, that several 
towns and many villages were completely destroyed or burned down 
(not to mention the massacres committed on civilians), that the 
Croats from Central Bosnia were pushed into three enclaves 
(Lasva Valley -- 80,000 people, Kiseljak-Kresevo -- about 
100,000, Zepce -- 50,000 and Usora -- 20,000), and that the 
Croatian people are facing complete extinction because of 
constant Muslim attacks (with the exception of Usora, which is 
constantly being attacked by Serbs). Mr. Puljic, the Bosnian 
archbishop, realized this and said in a sermon some time ago 
that "a propaganda machine is being created in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the aim of which is to completely destroy 
the Croatian enclaves." He made this statement although it is 
known that he is inclined to support Izetbegovic. He asked the 
world to exert pressure on the Muslim leadership in order to 
prevent them carrying out their goal. 
<H5>  Illegal "Legal Organs" </H5>
  Since the Croats in the Central Bosnian enclaves are 
defending their territory, trying to save their existence in the 
places in which they had a majority according to the last census 
(see the table at the end of the text), and since the Muslim 
leadership is, at the same time, trying to destroy the Croatian 
Army in order to take land from the Croats -- as was proven 
during peace negotiations (in the talks on territorial 
partition, Izetbegovic told Tudjman that he would sign the Bonn 
proposal on condition that the whole territory of Central Bosnia 
became a part of the Muslim republic) -- it is not clear why the 
international community shows understanding for these politics. 
Even more, since there is no multicultural element in the 
Muslim politics, they are motivated exclusively by the national 
idea -- it wants to gain as much territory as possible for its 
state, even territories in which other peoples have lived for 
centuries, as is the case in Central Bosnia. 
  Silajdzic's letter to the United Nations is an act of 
revenge 
because the Muslim forces failed in their attempt to seize the 
Croatian enclaves or to begin their breakthrough to the south. 
Silajdzic knows that he cannot count on a victory in Central 
Bosnia, because the HVO have strengthened their positions there 
(it could happen that the Croats will take some Muslim 
territories), so he is now trying to reconstitute 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as a unitary state in order to get 
international support. According to its Constitution, 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is a state of three constituent nations, 
which means that all three have to reach consensus when 
decisions are taken. Since first the Serbs and then, after the 
Muslim offensive, the Croats also left the government and the 
Parliament of Bosnia-Herzegovina, there are now no legally 
elected representatives of these two nations in the legal bodies 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Silajdzic was incorrect when he told Mr. 
Yasushi Akashi, the UN special envoy: "We are a UN member and 
there are not three sides in Bosnia, there is only one side and 
that is the government of Bosnia- Herzegovina and the other 
legal bodies that represent Bosnia-Herzegovina as a UN member." 
Akashi knows, however, that the government and "other legal 
bodies" of Bosnia-Herzegovina are composed of Muslims only. 
Since they represent only one nation, and the Constitution says 
that Bosnia-Herzegovina is a state of three nations, Silajdzic's 
bodies do not have legitimacy. For this reason, Silajdzic can 
represent only Muslims, not Bosnia-Herzegovina. His wish is 
similar to that of Milosevic, who claims for Serbia the 
continuity of the former Yugoslavia. International law 
(Badinter's commission) contested Milosevic's wish, so that 
there is no reason to doubt that Silajdzic will receive the same 
answer. 

<H5>    Right to Bosnia-Herzegovina </H5>
  The international community is afraid of the unfolding 
events 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Since Bosnia-Herzegovina is a UN member, 
its collapse could, so it is claimed, become an argument that 
other states, especially in Eastern Europe, could use in order 
to annex territories of other states under the pretext of 
protecting their national minorities. This opinion prevailed 
during the discussion on Bosnia-Herzegovina in the U.S. Senate 
when it was decided that the U.S. President should propose the 
introduction of sanctions against Croatia. It was clearly 
stated in the resolution that "although the Croatian aim might 
be the protection of the ethnic Croatian community from the 
Muslim offensive in the short run, there is the doubt that 
Croatia might wish to change the borders in the long run." This 
doubt is not unfounded, but it is not correct that the Croats in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina are an "ethnic community," as is stated in 
the resolution adopted by the U.S. Senate. The Croats are one 
of the constituent nations. This is stated in the Constitution 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina, so that the relation of the Republic of 
Croatia to the Croats in Bosnia cannot be an example for other 
countries (Russia, Serbia, Iran...) that are starting, or have 
already started, aggression against other states, trying to take 
territories from them and change borders by force. The Croats 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina are not a minority, but a nation, they 
have the same rights as the most numerous nation there -- the 
Muslims (and the Serbs, too). This makes it clear that 
Bosnia-Herzegovina can survive only if its three nations reach 
an agreement, as has already been stated thousands of times. In 
other words, Bosnia-Herzegovina will not survive unless the 
legitimate representatives of its three nations find an 
acceptable concept for its survival. Through intervention from 
outside, Bosnia-Herzegovina can be saved for some time if a 
protectorate, in other words a certain kind of occupation, is 
introduced. 
  From the Turkish occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina to the 
present day it has existed only as a province of an occupier. 
The occupiers were first the Turks, who granted it a certain 
autonomy within their empire. Bosnia-Herzegovina was then 
occupied by the Austrian-Hungarian monarchy, and, in the end, 
there were the periods of the greater-Serbian (Yugoslavia 
between the two world wars) and communist (Tito's Yugoslavia) 
dictatorships. When Yugoslavia was dissolved, the population of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina decided in a referendum that their country 
should become a sovereign state (the Croats also voted for this 
proposal), which was later recognized by the international 
community. Milosevic committed an act of aggression against it, 
occupying around 70 percent of its territory. He also carried 
out ethnic cleansing of the Muslims (but also of Croats in 
Bosnian Posavina). Since the international community was not 
able to force the Serbs to stop the aggression and to return the 
territories they had cleansed, the Muslims adopted the Serbian 
concept and started occupying the territories with a Croatian 
majority (Central Bosnia, Vares), as well as those areas in 
which the Croats were a minority (Travnik, Bugojno, Konjic, 
Jablanica...). The Croats were expelled from their homes. They 
no longer control a single town in which the Muslims had the 
majority before the war (approximately the same number of Croats 
and Muslims lived in Stolac). 
<H5>  Failure of Peace Offers </H5>
  It is true that during this war the political leadership of 
the Bosnian Croats and their army made certain moves that cannot 
be justified (they were accused by the leaderships of both the 
Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosna and of Croatia), but 
regardless of how significant they might have been, they still 
cannot justify the Muslim offensive, the aim which is -- as was 
expressed by the Sarajevo archbishop -- "a complete destruction 
of Croatian enclaves" and -- as politicians warn -- a 
breakthrough toward the south in order to cut the Croatian state 
into two parts. These intentions of the Muslim leadership 
cannot be regarded benevolently by the political leadership of 
the Republic of Croatia, the state that is taking care of half a 
million refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina (mostly Muslims). 
Croatia simply cannot allow the Muslim army to expel 200,000 
Croats from the enclaves in Central Bosnia. The Croatian 
leadership was aware of the danger that sanctions could be 
introduced against it, so it did not want to send its army to 
the territory of another state, although there were requests for 
help and although it did not have the intention of occupying 
territory, but of protecting the people in the enclaves and in 
northern Herzegovina. Supported by the international community, 
the Croatian leadership tried to break the Muslim offensive 
through various peace initiatives and compromises offered to 
Alija Izetbegovic, but to no avail. Since Izetbegovic and 
Silajdzic did not want to give in, and since the Muslim army 
continued its attacks, volunteers from Croatia born in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina joined the HVO in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This 
was, however, not enough to stop the Muslim aggression, so the 
associations of Bosnian Croats active in Croatia compiled lists 
and carried out an informal mobilization of Croats born in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina (about 1,500 people), who went to Bosnia as 
volunteers. 
  On 7 February, when deciding on the introduction of 
sanctions against Croatia and on the proposal they will submit 
to the United Nations, the foreign ministers of the European 
Union will hopefully not forget that the Croats in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina are neither a minority nor an ethnic 
community, but a nation, that they are fighting in Central 
Bosnian enclaves against the Muslim forces ("government forces") 
that want to carry out ethnic cleansing there (as has already 
been done to 120,000 Croats). They will hopefully not forget 
that Croatia is taking care of 700,000 refugees, half of whom 
come from Bosnia-Herzegovina, that Bosnia-Herzegovina cannot be 
an example for some countries that may try to annex the 
territories of other countries on the pretext of protecting 
their minorities. Apart from that, the European Union has to 
bear in mind that Bosnia-Herzegovina can survive only if the 
European Union establishes a protectorate over it, as was done 
by Austria after the Berlin Congress.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] New York, February 14 (TANJUG) -- NATO's ultimatum 
to the warring sides in the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is an act of "unauthorized usurpation of the 
political powers of the United Nations Security Council," 
president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Zoran Lilic said 
in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali which 
on Monday circulated as an official document at the U.N. 
hearquarters. 
  On February 9, the North Atlantic Council threatened to 
launch air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs unless they 
withdrew their heavy artillery 20 kilometres from the centre of 
Sarajevo within ten days. NATO also demanded from the Moslem 
side to place its heavy arms under U.N. control. 
  Sarajevo is the scene of a Moslem-Serb conflict in the 
tragic 
three-sided civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina among local Moslems, 
Serbs and Croats. 
  NATO adopted its decision on possible air strikes against 
the 
Bosnian Serb positions under strong influence of a suspicion, 
but lacking evidence, that the Serbs are responsible for the 
massacre at a Sarajevo market on Febuary 5, in which, according 
to Moslem reports, 68 civilians were killed and nearly 200 
wounded. 
  "We believe that decisions, and especially those setting 
ultimatums in international relations, cannot be based on 
assumed guilt because any such decision would be a crime 
itself," Lilic said in the letter. 
  He stressed the need for a peaceful settlement of the 
Bosnian 
conflict and assessed as alarming NATO's decision to seek 
solution to the Bosnian crisis through ultimatums and the use of 
force. 
  "It is clear that such decisions stimulate continuation of 
war and that peace can be achieved only through negotiations on 
equal footing," the Yugoslav president said in the letter to the 
U.N. secretary-general.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Miroslav Lazanski: "How To Control Guns"] </F>
  [Text] NATO's ultimatum to the Serbian side in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to withdraw heavy weapons at least 20 
kilometers away from Sarajevo in 10 days or face bombing, 
according to analysts, is direct military interference of the 
Western military alliance, supporting one of the warring sides, 
the Muslims, in the civil war in Bosnia. 
  What are the repercussions in case the Serbs withdraw their 
heavy weapons 20 kilometers away from Sarajevo, and what are 
they if they do not? What, after all, are the "heavy" weapons 
of the Serbian army and what are criteria for determining that? 
Could the withdrawal of these arms seriously weaken the 
military position of the Serbs in comparison with that of the 
Muslims? What will happen if the Serbs in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina reject NATO's ultimatum? 
<H5>  Still in Range </H5>
  The Serbian side around Sarajevo has artillery pieces of 
76-, 
105-, 122-, 130-, and 155-mm caliber, and the 128-mm Plamen and 
Oganj multiple rocket launchers. They also have mortars of 60-, 
81-, 82-, and 120-mm, as well as T-55 and T-54 tanks, and T-54 
tanks with 100-mm guns. Are these the heavy arms that NATO 
demands to be withdrawn? If the guns of 76- and 105-mm are 
withdrawn 20 kilometers away from Sarajevo, the 130-mm guns with 
the range of 28 kilometers would still be in range. So would 
the 155-mm howitzers, which would reach Sarajevo suburbs, and 
122-mm howitzers and the 128-mm Oganj multiple rocket launchers, 
whose range is 21.8 kilometers. 
  Of course, the Serbs also have the 262-mm Orkan multiple 
rocket launchers, whose range is over 50 kilometers. So, the 
limit of 20 kilometers set by NATO does not solve anything. 
True, it could remove the bulk of the Serbian artillery from 
the separation line with the Muslim side in and around Sarajevo, 
but cannot absolutely prevent attacks on the town itself, or its 
suburbs, in case the fighting continues. 
<H5>  What To Do With Factories </H5>
  Moreover, mortars of 60-, 81-, 82-, and 120-mm are small and 
can easily be hidden, which renders the control of withdrawal 
virtually impossible. The Serbian side also has the light, 
partisan-type, single barrel version of the Oganj and Plamen 
missile launchers. These are also very easy to camouflage and 
hide and can be used for attacks if the need for this arises. 
There is also the question as to what to do with the 30-mm 
self-propelled antiaircraft artillery pieces ("praga"), or those 
of 57-mm (self propelled antiaircraft guns of Russian 
production)? Are these also heavy weapons? 
  Will NATO also set an ultimatum to the Muslim side to move 
artillery 20 kilometers away from Sarajevo? And where and in 
what direction? The Muslims in Sarajevo have several guns of 
105-, 122-, 130-mm, and several self-propelled artillery pieces 
and tanks. Some of these had been left behind in the former 
school center of the former Yugoslav People's Army for training 
and the Muslim side modified them for use. Others came through 
the violation of the arms embargo. 
  Members of Muslim units in Sarajevo have a fairly large 
number of mortars of 60, 81, 82, and 120 mm. They also have 
various recoilless guns of Pakistani, Turkish, Iranian, and 
Western production. All these are of relatively small and can 
be hidden, especially in the town. How will UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Force] control the withdrawal of these weapons to a 
distance of 20 kilometers away from the town? Can UNPROFOR 
representatives register accurately who violates cease-fires 
with artillery just by placing themselves on the line separating 
the warring sides? Hardly! 
  The withdrawal of the Serbian heavy arms to 20 kilometers 
away from Sarajevo could be a direct provocative factor and 
challenge for the Muslim side to launch an offensive of larger 
proportions, especially because Washington holds the view that 
the "Muslims should be given a chance to regain militarily what 
they have lost in the war." In other words, NATO and the West 
are trying, to put it graphically, to tie the hands and legs of 
the Serbian side in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and then throw 
it in the ring. 
  The withdrawal of the Serbian heavy weapons 20 kilometers 
away from Sarajevo could endanger the vital sections of the 
Serbian military industry: the Pretis factory in Vogosca, the 
factory for aircraft engines in Rajlovac, the Famos factory, the 
Koran factory for tank engines in Pale, and some other plants 
for production of weapons and equipment. All these are 
relatively close to Sarajevo. The reaction of the Serbs living 
in Sarajevo, people who have stayed in their homes, is a special 
problem. Will they start moving out?

  [Text] Vladislav Jovanovic, federal minister of foreign 
affairs, spoke about the latest NATO threats in the "On the 
Spot" program of the Belgrade Radio First Channel today. This 
is what he said among other things about the aims of the 
ultimatum: 
  [Begin Jovanovic recording] The present (?Muslim) leadership 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina has never been independent. Whenever a 
problem regarding Bosnia was being solved, this leadership was 
always led by interests and directions from abroad. It is 
indebted to these [foreign] factors, considering the huge 
support it has been receiving. This support is financial, 
moral, and political, and probably there are also ideological 
and religious elements which are rarely pointed to although they 
lie at the foundation of everything. 
  Therefore, foreign interests, the interests of certain 
factors, have always been not to end a Yugoslav crisis during a 
time that they needed to penetrate the Balkan Peninsula deeply 
and find firmer and more lasting support for their new strategic 
[word indistinct] in the Balkans. Therefore, whenever peace was 
in the offing, whenever things looked as if they were virtually 
solved, foreign factors intervened with actions of an opposite 
nature which was immediately interpreted by the Muslim 
leadership as a signal, as a support, almost as an order to turn 
their backs on negotiations and peace. They have always acted 
accordingly; ranging from Cutilheiro's mission when the Bosnian 
crisis was expected to be solved by exclusively political means 
and the war was not to take place at all, to various stages of 
negotiations. Also in this case, it turned out that a virtual 
assassination of a political kind was committed at this renewed 
peace process that started from the heart of the crisis, from 
Sarajevo, followed with many hopes. This is this ultimatum 
which was obviously made with a view to calling on the Muslim 
side not to cooperate in the peace process, because why should 
it cooperate when it can expect to get much more in 10 days by 
air raids and war than it would achieve by peace. [end 
recording]

  [Text] The international community, which has in fact 
caused the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, just as it is 
directing and leading this crisis, is directly and indirectly 
using this crisis to test everything that it is interested in. 
It is in the crisis in the former Yugoslavia that the power, 
transformation, and even the very purpose of NATO are tested. 
It is in the crisis in the former Yugoslavia that power, that 
is, powerlessness, and the very purpose of the United Nations 
are tested. If NATO pushes itself to the foreground, that would 
in fact mean the beginning of the end of the United Nations. 
NATO's threats directed exclusively at the Serbian side have 
brought exactly what was desired -- despite the very 
transparence of the almost obviously stage-managed event on the 
Sarajevo marketplace -- that is to say, they have brought the 
currently better negotiating position for the Muslim side at the 
Geneva negotiations. 
  The Geneva peace negotiations are virtually not taking place 
at all. They are being merely simulated, because the Muslims 
are waiting to see what will happen with the threat. After all, 
Lord Owen could not but say that the Muslims will be obstructing 
the talks until the deadline given to the Serbs to withdraw 
heavy weaponry expires. As regards the air raids themselves, 
things nevertheless are not to Izetbegovic's liking. Firstly, 
things are so serious that Washington and Moscow are holding 
direct mutual consultations. They are serious to such an extent 
that all of this is affecting direct relations between the White 
House and the Kremlin. 
  In this case, we would say, all considerations are even more 
heedful. Moscow said that it does not accept the NATO ultimatum 
and that no final decision can be made without the Security 
Council. A demand was issued by the Russian Parliament to the 
Russian representatives at the United Nations, to use their 
right of veto. According to information received from New York, 
the already convened Security Council session has been adjourned 
until Monday so that the Russian demand can be thoroughly 
studied. 
  When one studies more carefully the behavior of UN Secretary 
General Butrus-Ghali and his special envoy Yasushi Akashi, then 
it is also clear that they are going to do everything they can 
to reach a solution to the conflict in Bosnia at the negotiating 
table. This is among other things because, as Yasushi Akashi 
has put it, there may come a fatal strike on the United Nations 
itself. The Japanese diplomat said that he is going to make a 
decision following his own conscience, and not according to 
wishes of the world public. I cannot ignore that public, but I 
can also not woo it with my decisions, Yasushi Akashi said. 
  While we are on the subject of the public, let us point to a 
statement by Vitaliy Churkin, who said that Russia also has a 
public that is equally as legitimate as the American, French, or 
German ones. 
  Finally, the telephone conversation between Clinton and 
Yeltsin, according to what has been announced, could mean a 
political draw that would indicate: There will be no air raids, 
but also one has to meet the new Muslim territorial demands at 
least partly. Exactly these new increased Muslim demands seem to 
have been the reason for all that happened at the Sarajevo 
marketplace.

<F P=106> [Report by Dragoljub Stankic] </F>
  [Text] Following NATO's threat to the Serbs in Bosnia, the 
General Staff of the Yugoslav Army today organized a news 
conference. Colonel Dragan Vuksic, deputy head of the 
Department for Cooperation with International Organizations, 
commented on NATO's ultimatum and decision to carry out air 
strikes. Dragoljub Stankic reports: 
  [Stankic] NATO's decision is not a surprise and is in line 
with the decisions made by that organization at its sessions of 
2 and 9 February. This was stated by Colonel Dragan Vuksic. In 
his view, the decision is controversial in both the language in 
which it was written and the content itself. However, the most 
important thing is that if the decision were to be carried out 
in the way envisaged, all peace efforts would be annulled and we 
would enter a new dangerous stage with unforeseeable 
consequences, Colonel Vuksic stressed. 
  [Begin Vuksic recording] NATO's decision, if it is indeed 
that, represents a precedent in international relations and is 
virtually making NATO equal or superior to the world 
organization. As far as we know, on the basis of the agreements, 
consultations, and mandates given to NATO hitherto, this 
organization does not have the right to make decisions on air 
strikes, preventive air strikes, and on punishing, carrying out 
reprisals against the warring sides, unless it was given a clear 
task by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] as to what side is 
violating what has been agreed, and how it is doing it, how it 
is not implementing what has been agreed on. 
  This was not done in this case, and NATO, with its decision, 
is threatening to disturb the system of relations, the current 
system of relations in the world organization, and to abuse, use 
the world organization in order to implement or carry out acts 
that would mean not only the end of peace operations in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also the escalation of the war conflict 
on the territory of that former Yugoslav republic, the Balkans, 
and perhaps further afield. [end recording] 
  [Stankic] Colonel Vuksic stressed that he did not know what 
the real aim of the decision was, but that it represented a 
dangerous precedent, and that he hoped that such a decision 
would not be carried out after all. 
  In reply to correspondents' question whether the Yugoslav 
Army would respond if air strikes did take place, Colonel Vuksic 
said: 
  [Begin Vuksic recording] The Yugoslav Army has its tasks and 
it must follow the situation and react to the events in the 
surrounding. I would like to remind you of the principled stand 
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that we will not obstruct 
in any way peace activities of the United Nations and other 
members of the international community involved in the 
settlement of the Yugoslav crisis. Such an act would certainly 
not constitute a peace effort, and, as I said, it would 
contradict everything that has been done and achieved so far. 
The behavior of the Yugoslav Army, of the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia, and other international and other interested parties 
would primarily depend on the behavior by the side that would 
take such an action. [end recording]

Commission Tadeusz Mazowiecki, in his latest report, that more 
than 3,000 Moslems had fled the Raska area, the southwestern 
part of the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia. 
  Addressing the participants in the 50th session of the U.N. 
Human Rights Commission in Geneva from January 31 to March 11, 
the Yugoslav Government underscored that many Moslems in the 
Raska area had been fighting in the war in the former Yugoslav 
republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The most murderous Bosnian Moslem units are those in which 
the "Sandzak" Moslems i.e. Moslems from Raska (Sandzak being the 
Turkish name for this area) are fighting for the interests of 
Bosnian Moslem hardline leader Alija Izetbegovic, the Yugoslav 
Governement stressed. 
  In Raska, an area consisting of eight communes -- two of 
them 
being in the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia and six in the Yugoslav 
Republic of Montenegro -- Moslems account for one half of the 
population and Serbs and Montenegrins for the other half. 
  Moslems constitute the majority population only in three 
communes. 
  Raska borders with the Bosnian Serb Republic (S.R.) against 
which Bosnian Moslems are undertaking offensive actions with a 
view to seizing the S.R., joining Sandzak and thus creating a 
large Islamic state in Europe. 
  Last week a trial of a large separatist group who had made 
an 
attempt to detach Raska from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
commenced in Novi Pazar, the largest town in this area. 
  The Yugoslav Federal Government pointed out that a large 
number of Moslems, as well as Serbs, had left Raska for economic 
reasons and gone to live abroad or in other, more developed 
parts of Yugoslavia. 
  The government stated that "only a minority of population 
has 
left the Raska area because of the disturbed national 
relations", resulting from the "extremely aggressive Moslem 
fundamentalism," and the immediate vicinity of the brutal war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The Yugoslav investigating officers have done their best to 
shed light on the kidnapping of the Moslems from Sjeverin and 
Strbac, places in Raska, but they have been unsuccessful so far 
since "a major part of investigation has to be carried out on 
the foreign territory, over which the investigating officers 
from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have no jurisdiction," 
the Yugoslav Government pointed out. 
  Several Moslems from Sjeverin were kidnapped in a bus taking 
them to their work over the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and 
their compatriots from Strbac were kidnapped in a train passing 
also through part of the territory of this neighbouring 
republic, in February 1993.

  [Excerpts] Belgrade, 14 Feb (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Prime 
Minister Radoje Kontic left for New York early today at the 
invitation of the New York-based Council for International 
Relations, the most influential institution of its kind in the 
United States. 
  Just before his departure Kontic said that there are a 
number 
of reasons for his visit to New York. [passage omitted] 
  "We will use our stay in New York to contact top UN 
officials, particularly UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali and 
his aides, as well as officials of various UN agencies." 
  According to Kontic the main topic of the talks will be the 
NATO ultimatum and the threat to bomb the Bosnian Serbs. "We 
will discuss this issue from two aspects. One of them is the 
position and the role of the United Nations in adopting concrete 
decisions on air strikes, and the other aspect is the 
consequences and dangers for the peace process and a possible 
escalation of the war if NATO threats are realized." 
  "Of course, an unavoidable topic in the United Nations will 
be the sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the 
humanitarian aid, and the reintegration of our state in the 
system of the United Nations and the international community." 
[passage omitted] 
  Recalling the NATO ultimatum, Kontic concluded: "I do not 
believe that there is one serious reason at this moment for NATO 
to realize its threats and bomb the Bosnian Serbs. I believe 
that the purpose of this visit to New York is to help ease the 
tension."

  [Text] Belgrade, 13 Feb (TANJUG) -- Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic last night received Vitaliy Churkin, Russian 
deputy minister for foreign affairs and President Yeltsin's 
special envoy. 
  In the course of extensive and open talks, the Serbian 
president's office reports, views were exchanged regarding the 
efforts to put an end to the civil war in the area of 
ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina and find a political solution to the 
crisis. They stressed that NATO's decision has undoubtedly 
inflicted political damage on the negotiating process for 
ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina. Agreement was expressed to the effect 
that there is no alternative to political negotiations as the 
only sensible path that can lead to a stable peace in this area. 
  In this context it was pointed out that reduced tensions in 
the Sarajevo area would represent a significant step toward 
securing a political solution, as this would avert the risk of 
foreign military intervention and an escalation of warfare with 
far-reaching consequences for peace and stability in this part 
of Europe.

  [Text] Dr. Bujar Bukoshi, prime minister of the republic 
of Kosova, sent a letter to the governments of NATO member 
countries, in which he supports the ultimatum of this alliance 
on withdrawal of artillery from Sarajevo. This ultimatum is a 
brave step, Dr. Bukoshi states, to be distinguished from the 
previous threats of the West, which were not realized. Those 
threats only made the aggressor brave and diminished the 
credibility of international powers. 
  Peace in the Balkans is not possible without resolving the 
Kosova crisis, Prime Minister Bukoshi stresses further on in the 
letter. Kosova once again asks the United States to intensify 
pressures against the Belgrade regime so as to interrupt the 
systematic oppression against the Albanian people in Kosova, 
Bukoshi underlines. 
  In this letter, Prime Minister Bukoshi asks the West to 
influence the return democratic institutions and international 
observers to Kosova, as well as to respect the elementary rights 
of 2 million Albanians in Kosova. If an immediate preventive 
action is taken, there is still time for the international 
community to enable a peaceful solution to the question of 
Kosova before its citizens face the tragedy and horror that can 
be of greater proportions than what is happening in Bosnia, 
prime minister of the republic of Kosova writes among other 
things in his letter addressed to the governments of NATO member 
countries.

  [Excerpt] Pristina, 11 Feb (TANJUG) -- The Democratic 
Alliance of Kosovo [DSK] supports the NATO decision to bomb 
Bosnian Serb positions around Sarajevo, DSK deputy president 
Fehmi Agani said at a news conference today. 
  Agani said the lifting of the siege of Sarajevo would put 
both warring sides into an approximately equal position, and 
explained that "as long as the Serbs are holding dominant 
positions there is no basis for a just peaceful solution." 
  Commenting on Albania's official offer of its airports for 
NATO actions in Bosnia, Agani said briefly that "this is 
Albania's obligation, as a member of the international 
community," adding that similar offers had been made by Italy, 
Turkey, and Germany. 
  Agani described DSK president Ibrahim Rugova's visit to the 
United States as successful, in particular the contacts he had 
with President Bill Clinton and representatives of the U.S. 
Administration. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by "cap, rk": "No Reason To Withdraw Slovak </F>
UNPROFOR Units From Former Yugoslavia, According to Andrejcak"] 
  [Text] Bratislava/Daruvar--"We are prepared for this 
option, but the transfer of units to Slovakia is, for the time 
being, out of the question," a high-ranking officer from the 
Slovak Engineering Battalion (SLOVENGBAT) operating within the 
framework of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] on the territory of 
former Yugoslavia, who did not wish to be named, declared 
yesterday in connection with the adoption of the NATO ultimatum 
against Bosnian Serbs. He said that, in the event of 
endangerment, the entire peacekeeping forces would be pulled 
out, and not just the units of individual states. He refused, 
however, to assess the political situation and decisions by the 
UNPROFOR commander in the Balkan conflict. He said that our 
UNPROFOR members have been operating in Sarajevo for nine months 
and stressed that "they want to serve there and do not even want 
to be replaced." Their "general security" in the Bosnian 
capital is guaranteed, he said. 
  In reply to our question about his view of the stand adopted 
by Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev, who, 
according to a TA SR report, rejected the possibility of UN 
military intervention in the area of the Bosnian conflict, 
Slovak Minister of Defense Imrich Andrejcak said that the 
Russian Government had not officially issued any such statement. 
"I do not know the statement to which you refer, and, 
therefore, I am not going to comment on it. As for the operation 
of our battalion, with the deadline mentioned [in the NATO 
Council ultimatum] approaching, the UNPROFOR command will adopt 
measures to protect its own units. We need not worry." 
According to Minister Andrejcak, at present there is no reason 
to withdraw Slovak UNPROFOR units from former Yugoslavia. 
"Measures will be adopted so that they are not in the 
endangered zone," he added. According to information provided 
by the Ministry of Defense of the Slovak Republic, the 
engineering battalion of the Army of the Slovak Republic on the 
territory of former Yugoslavia is deployed in Croatia and is 
subordinated to the UNPROFOR command.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Michal Kovac by an unidentified </F>
PRACA correspondent; place and date not given: "Attacks Escalate 
Tension"] 
  [Text] As president of the Slovak Republic, I am trying to 
execute my job so as to gain the support of the widest possible 
spectrum of citizens, President Michal Kovac said in an 
interview for [Bratislava] PRACA [in Slovak] No. 33. I was one 
of the cofounders of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
[HZDS] and have spent an intensive part of my life with it. In 
the elections, I assumed my share of responsibility for the 
movement's policy. I have received with pleasure reports about 
the growing sympathy for myself within the HZDS. This growth, 
which represents up to 15 percent, has occurred despite the 
escalating attempts, particularly within HZDS ranks, to 
discredit the president. It has become apparent, however, that 
HZDS members and sympathizers think otherwise than individuals 
in the Republican Board or in the HZDS Club of Deputies. 
  [PRACA] There is constant talk about certain tension between 
the Castle and the government. Views are being foisted upon the 
public to the effect that you are building some kind of a second 
center of executive power in the state. 
  [Kovac] The assertion that I am building some kind of a 
second center of state power is untrue and absurd. According to 
the Constitution of the Slovak Republic, executive power in the 
state is executed by the president and the Government of the 
Slovak Republic. The president has had to build his chancellery 
with its own experts to be able to exercise his constitutional 
powers. Hence, there do not exist any two centers of state 
power. The existence of political centers of power is another 
matter. One cannot speak about a single political center in a 
pluralistic political system; several such centers exist. 
However, on the basis of election results, one, two, or more 
political entities that come to an agreement on a government 
program form the government. Even the president of the Republic 
helps to implement this government program from the position of 
the head of state. I painstakingly see to it that I engage in 
this activity within the framework of my constitutional powers. 
The discussion about a second center of power reminds me of the 
fatal policy practiced by dogmatists of the former totalitarian 
regime. After all, the prerequisite of a functioning democracy 
is the division of power, which is clearly defined in Slovakia 
by the Constitution of the democratic state. 
  [PRACA] How do you explain the existence of views that, even 
though it was the HZDS that won the elections, people from the 
Public Against Violence movement, the Civic Democratic Union, 
and Czechoslovakists have conquered the Castle, have surrounded 
you in the Office of the President, and act as your advisers? 
  [Kovac] This is an untrue assertion. I will cite only a few 
basic facts. Of the nine key posts in the Office of the 
President of the Slovak Republic, four are held by people who 
come from the HZDS or are HZDS sympathizers, one is from the 
Slovak National Party [SNS], three have declared themselves 
independent, and I regard them as such, and one is from the 
Christian Social Union. Another group of staffers consists of 
former HZDS deputies to the Federal Assembly who are acting as 
department heads or desk officers. They are complemented with 
staffers professing allegiance to the SNS, and two come from the 
Christian Democratic Movement [KDH]. The majority are without 
party affiliation, both originally and at present. 
  In the election campaign, the HZDS campaigned for the idea 
of 
filling posts with professionally qualified and morally 
competent people. I tried to achieve this also in building the 
Office of the President when I gave priority to the criterion of 
professionalism. There is not a single staffer here who would 
not identify with the existence of an independent Slovak state, 
no one who would not swear loyalty to the sovereign republic. I 
cannot accept the criticism that people are working in the 
Office of the President who had opposed the partition of the 
CSFR because this would run counter to basic human rights, my 
philosophy, and the position of the president as a 
representative of all citizens. I accept the criteria of 
loyalty toward the state and its constitutional bodies, moral 
irreproachability, and professionalism and expertise. How will 
my present critics come to terms with this approach, should a 
coalition be formed, either now or after the elections, 
involving the HZDS, the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], the 
Conservative Democratic Party, and the SNS, should the 
government be joined by members of the KDH, the SDL, or other 
parties? After all, the prime minister has received such an 
offer and he did not reject it. Therefore, I consider the 
criticism of the composition of the Office of the President to 
be only a pretext for attacks against the president of the 
Slovak Republic. I reply to all my critics: Do you think that 
the president of the Slovak Republic does not feel sufficient 
responsibility for the kind of people who are working for him, 
[that he does not care] in whose favor and in favor of which 
cause they are working? Is it necessary to remind the president 
of such elementary matters?

  [Text] [Announcer] After leaving discussions held by the 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] in Casta Papiernicka, 
Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar held a telephone conversation 
with the chairman of the strongest opposition party [Party of 
the Democratic Left, PDL]. Ivan Samel, an editor, today asked 
PDL Chairman Peter Weiss about the content of the conversation. 
  [Begin recording] [Samel] Mr. Chairman, the subject of your 
telephone conversation yesterday with the prime minister was a 
proposal to reach a compromise solution on the bill amending the 
existing law on the privatization of large enterprises. How did 
you react to that proposal? 
  [Weiss] We are not against discussions. Nonetheless, we have 
already declared our position quite clearly. 
  [Samel] We have heard that a part of that proposal was to 
link the privatization of large enterprises to the question of a 
vote of confidence or no-confidence in the government. 
  [Weiss] We have envisaged such a tactical variant. In this 
instance, however, the main issue is the content of this law--in 
order to calm down the atmosphere surrounding privatization and 
in order that the law should provide guarantees for effective 
parliamentary and public supervision of the privatization 
process, with the aim that privatization ceases to be a bone of 
contention between political parties. Unless this problem is 
resolved, such suspicion will constantly destabilize any 
government. [passage omitted] 
  [Samel] In your view, is there a will within the opposition 
to force the resignation of the government or cast a vote of 
no-confidence in it? 
  [Weiss] Within the opposition, there is a great deal of 
dissatisfaction with the way the government is governing the 
country. The government lacks a concept of economic policy; it 
has a bad, a very bad, image abroad, it is not sufficiently 
open, and there is not a rational division of labor in the 
government; and decisionmaking is being increasingly 
concentrated in the hands of one person, which is not solely a 
political problem because it is a problem of government 
operation. 
  To put it simply, it is no longer possible for one man, 
however hardworking he may be, to be able to cope with such a 
number of problems within the time frame available. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Samel] We have also learned that, during the telephone 
conversation, a proposal was made to keep this government in 
office until early parliamentary elections are held, which 
should take place at the beginning of this summer. 
  [Weiss] We are in favor of early elections, but we do not 
see 
any reason for giving support to this government. 
  [Samel] Are you going to hold separate talks with the group 
that has been created within the HZDS? 
  [Weiss] We will hold political discussions with anyone who 
is 
prepared to resolve this political crisis in a democratic manner 
so that the power does not lie in the street but, rather, so 
that the citizens make the decision in the end, in early 
democratic elections. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] In Modra, an extraordinary meeting 
of the republican leadership of the Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia [HZDS] is being held behind closed doors. [passage 
omitted] 
  A working commission was asked to prepare and draft the 
joint 
conclusions of today's meeting of the HZDS republican 
leadership. Part of the statement should refer to proposals on 
how to deal with the disciplinary procedure against two members 
of the government and nine parliamentary deputies who have all 
signed the program of the Alternative [of Political Realism]. 
  Press Agency of the Slovak Republic reporters have learned 
from reliable sources that the prime minister is inclined to 
accept the view that, if elections were inevitable, the earlier 
[they are held] the better. He would also find acceptable a 
referendum on two questions: the deputies' mandates and early 
elections. Vladimir Meciar is also believed to support the 
expulsion of Roman Kovac and Jozef Moravcik from the HZDS 
because they did not adhere to the movement's rules and 
endangered the unity of the government. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by correspondents Dagmar Bazlikov and Ludmila </F>
Bulakova on a news conference given by Slovak Prime Minister 
Vladimir Meciar in Morda on 12 February on the outcome of the 
HZDS leadership meeting; passages within quotation marks are 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Bazlikova] Questions by our colleagues from the 
mass media could be divided into two basic spheres: One part 
concerned the problems of early parliamentary elections, the 
second further policies toward those who presented an 
alternative of political realism to the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. The first sphere includes a reply 
to the question of whether the HZDS prefers early elections or a 
referendum: 
  [Meciar] "Basically, there are various circumstances. It is 
possible that we will agree with some of the parliamentary 
parties so that we will have 90 votes in the parliament to adopt 
a constitutional law on early elections--and, in that case, 
there is no need to have a referendum on this question. 
  "Another alternative may arise, which is basically being 
prepared by the opposition, who were for immediately calling 
early elections, but now, when it seems to them that they could 
have a majority in the National Council, they postpone this 
immediately by one year. [words indistinct] in this case, there 
are 350,000 citizens going for the referendum, who I assume will 
support such initiative. 
  "The referendum is connected with yet another question--with 
the right of the deputies to preserve an absolute mandate even 
after they denounced the program with which they went into the 
elections, even after they denounced the right that ensues for 
them from the election law. And that is also the question that 
the citizens should decide in a referendum. 
  "As to the period up to the early elections, I think they 
should take place soon. Personally, I think that the election 
period of the parliament should be shortened to one-half. The 
bridging of this time is necessary and suitable. Naturally, 
this will not lead to instability. In fact, it aids stability 
because only those who really want to work in the government 
will be in it, and not those who spend half of their working 
hours trying to work out how to discredit them." 
  [Bazlikova] Asked whether Vladimir Meciar wants to go to the 
elections as prime minister or as the head of the opposition 
party, the HZDS chairman said: 
  [Meciar] "It is up to the parliament, not up to me. In no 
circumstances do I intend to resign." 
  [Bazlikova] Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar characterized the 
possible early elections as follows: 
  [Meciar] "As to the early elections, I think that this time 
the elections will include three large groupings: The HZDS will 
be in the center of one group, the Party of Democratic Left 
[SDL] will be in the center of another, and the Christian 
Democratic Movement [KDH] will be in the center of the third. 
The decision about the results of the elections will be made 
between the three. The SDL assumes that, if a party of similar 
leanings wins the elections in Poland and probably will win them 
in Hungary, it is its duty to win in Slovakia. We are doing all 
we can not to fulfill this party's hopes." 
  [Bazlikova] The journalists also wondered whether the prime 
minister assumed that the Slovak Parliament will dismiss his 
Cabinet as early as at the meeting that will continue next week: 
  [Meciar] "As to the possibility of expressing no confidence 
in the government--that always exists. In any case, whoever 
attempts to do so must count on our reaction." 
  [Bazlikova] Asked whether he could indicate what this 
reaction would be, the prime minister said unequivocally: 
  [Meciar] "No." 
  [Bulakova] The second part of the news conference, after the 
extraordinary meeting of the republican leadership of the HZDS 
in Modra yesterday, concerned the next moves against those who 
initiated the Alternative of Political Realism, especially 
against two members of the government--Deputy Prime Minister 
Roman Kovac and Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik. This is how 
Vladimir Meciar responded to the possibility of their dismissal. 
  [Meciar] "It is a test of character. Both Dolgos [former 
privatization minister] and Kucera [former education minister] 
themselves asked to be recalled and resigned after the vote of 
no-confidence in them was passed. They knew what their moral 
duty was. For Moravcik and Kovac, it is a character test, a test 
of their realization of what is their moral duty. They should 
be given a chance to express themselves." 
  [Bulakova] In connection with the dismissal of these two 
government members, the issue of who will replace them came 
about. Commenting on this problem, Vladimir Meciar said, among 
other things: 
  [Meciar] "The issue of their replacement is a matter for a 
coalition agreement. To be honest, until the [republican] 
leadership passed its decision [on Moravcik and Kovac], I 
discussed with nobody whether this replacement could be dealt 
with in some other way." [passage omitted] 
  [Bulakova] General questions were also voiced at the meeting 
between the prime minister and journalists yesterday. One of 
them concerned the assessment of the balance of political forces 
in the Slovak Parliament. Speaking about this issue, Vladimir 
Meciar said, among other things: 
  [Meciar] "Everyone has an axe to grind. For example, 
Hungarian parties and Cernak [chairman of Slovak National 
Party], or the Christian Democratic Party and the Party of the 
Democratic Left. The parliament cannot carry out its work. It 
is incapable of agreeing on anything other than issues directed 
against the government and on the division of assets. 
  "A very dangerous precedent could arise as a result of the 
structure [government of broad coalition] they want to set up in 
this way. Everyone must have thought that the HZDS response 
would be that the HZDS would split up and that it would be the 
Hungarian political parties that would tip the balance of power 
with regard to the stability of the government. Their policy is 
widely known nowadays. Although the government, whose intention 
is to work against us, would have votes, it would be incapable 
of action. But if this government did not have these votes, it 
would fall because the opposition, including the HZDS, would 
have a clear majority. Unless, of course, they accept the 
Hungarians into the government coalition. [passage omitted] 
  "But if they accept them into the coalition, they will have 
to meet their demands. And you know what these demands are 
directed at! From this you can judge what Slovakia's future 
development would be like!" 
  [Bulakova] At the conclusion of the news conference, there 
was a question whether--in quotation marks--the dropping out of 
people from the HZDS was not a consequence of the fact that the 
movement had delayed turning itself into a political party with 
a clear political structure and ideological objectives. 
Answering this question, Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar said, 
among other things: 
  [Meciar] "This is not a dropping out; this is a cleansing 
process. Because only that which is diseased, which does not 
believe in itself, drops out. And that is good. The path of 
honesty is the best path. The path of intrigues, of 
decomposition, of social structures is a path leading nowhere. 
One can only score one victory this way. But, at the same 
time, such a victory amounts to a political defeat. The 
movement's structures have been cleansed, and all of its 
components are capable of carrying out normal political work."

  [Text] Ludovit Cernak, chairman of the Slovak National 
Party [SNS], has advocated a broad government coalition of 
pro-Slovak forces. However, he rejected the possibility of 
Hungarian political parties participating in this coalition. 
The SNS chairman thinks that the parties with pro-Slovak 
orientation are the parties capable of declaring, regardless of 
their positions in the past, their support for the national and 
state interests of Slovakia and, in particular, for the 
integrity and prosperity of the Slovak Republic. 
  Those parties suitable to form a broad coalition are said to 
be the Party of the Democratic Left, the Christian Democratic 
Movement, the Alliance of Democrats, and practically all of the 
factions of the ruling Movement for a Democratic Slovakia. 
According to Cernak, Hungarian political parties do not meet 
the requirements for creating a broad coalition of pro-Slovak 
forces because of their behavior in the process of Slovakia's 
admission to the Council of Europe.

  [Excerpts] The Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] Executive 
Committee held a meeting today in Bratislava. After the 
meeting, which ended shortly before our transmission, our 
correspondent Igor Kubik asked the SDL Chairman Peter Weiss to 
summarize the meeting's results. 
  [Begin Weiss recording] The Executive Council mainly 
discussed the present internal political situation and concluded 
that the way the government was ruling was damaging the country. 
The Slovak Republic or, rather, its government's image abroad 
is not good. The economic policy of the government is marred by 
systematic improvisation and the absence of an overall plan, 
which is all reflected in the social sphere, where the most 
threatened are the socially weakest strata, young families with 
children, and pensioners. And citizens are all the more worried 
about their security. It is necessary to create such political 
conditions as would change this state of affairs in a tangible 
way. The SDL warned almost a year ago that an internal crisis 
ought to be resolved by democratic means, by early elections. 
[passage omitted] 
  We are of the opinion that the solution lies in creating 
conditions for a government that could introduce a planned 
policy to be carried out within a four-year period. It should 
be a government formed by political forces intellectually 
prepared to meet the challenge and, at the same time, carry out 
a nonconfrontational policy and respect its partners' views and 
give up the politics of pressure, blackmail, and discrimination 
against political rivals. We will do everything we can to change 
the way power is exercised, not to street power, but in such a 
way that the decision would be made by citizens in democratic, 
early parliamentary elections. [end recording]

  [Text] Peter Weiss, first deputy chairman of the Slovak

the parliament, the official draft of the constitutional law on 
shortening the term of the Slovak parliament. The proposal says 
that, in keeping with the law on local elections, the elections 
should be held on 10-11 November. 
  Vladimir Meciar and Jozef Pokorny, chairmen of the Movement 
for a Democratic Slovakia and the Green Party in Slovakia, spoke 
in favor of shortening the term of the parliament and calling 
early elections. 
  Leaders of the Party of the Democratic Left, the Hungarian 
Christian Democratic Movement, and Coexistence regard early 
elections as the best solution. At their meeting yesterday, they 
agreed that these elections should be held on the same date as 
local elections. 
  The executive committee of the Conservative Democratic 
Party-Democratic Party also supports this alternative.

  [Text] Slovak Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac asked 
Slovak Television today to allow him to make a statement on the 
current political situation: 
  [Begin Kovac recording] I would like to emphasize, in this 
tense political situation, that the establishment of the 
Alternative of Political Realism within the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] is neither a deviation from its 
principles nor a betrayal. I am afraid that our honest 
intentions have been misinterpreted. Therefore, as one of the 
signatories of the Alternative, I would like to explain our 
proposal for dealing with the situation. 
  The political situation in the Slovak Republic is rather 
tense. Its worst feature is the situation in parliament, where 
the government is struggling with its need for a majority. As a 
result, parliament faces difficulties and is not able to pass 
important economic and social laws that are eagerly awaited by 
the population. On one side, there are diverging views and there 
is insufficent willingness to reach agreement; on the other, 
there is a well-coordinated attitude of the opposition. This, 
together, is paralyzing the work of parliament. 
  A democratic and a constitutional solution to this 
situation, 
which is in the interests of Slovakia as a whole, is early 
parliamentary elections. It is equally in the interests of 
Slovakia as a whole to make use of the time before early 
parliamentary elections to make sure that steps toward economic 
and social transformation are not halted. This requires a 
sensible agreement between all political forces, asked for by 
three-quarters of our population. 
  A group of parliamentary deputies and two members of the 
government put forward a possible solution within the HZDS 
parliamentary group: to create, before early parliamentary 
elections, a broad, coalition government that would consist of 
candidates from the majority of political forces. The role of 
this government would be to make participating parties 
concentrate on topical problems and to share political 
responsibility for solving them. 
  At the election, citizens will have to decide the direction 
Slovakia is to follow in the future. The right thing to do 
would be for the top representatives of the political entities 
to agree on this solution and, under the leadership of the HZDS, 
to form such a government jointly for a transitional period. 
This would also make it possible to continue with the tasks 
planned by the HZDS. Their personal attitudes and mutual 
relations, however, make this step unlikely. 
  This is why the idea came into being of setting up a 
government without the personal participation of the chairmen of 
the parties and to include in this government a number of 
experts without political affiliation. This is not a negation 
of the election result. This is simply the acknowledgement of 
the real distribution of political forces in parliament before 
early elections. 
  Only the continuation of economic and social measures that 
will gain sufficient support from the political forces will be 
able help Slovakia to overcome growing problems in the 
economy--the growth of unemployment and of social tension, 
problems in health care and education, and the decline in our 
citizens' standard of living. 
  It is impossible to continue the politics of confrontation, 
promoting the one and only correct view. It is necessary to 
stop seeing things in black and white and to get rid of the 
slogan "Who is not with us is against us." To reach agreement 
is in the real interests of Slovakia. This is not political 
naivete. This is political realism. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Regular Friday interview with Slovak Prime Minister </F>
Vladimir Meciar by Martiln Bartisek in Bratislava on 11 
February--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Bartisek] This week you paid a very short visit 
to NATO headquarters in Brussels to sign a document on 
Slovakia's joining the Partnership for Peace program. On this 
occasion, you said that the Slovak Republic was prepared to 
immediately conclude an agreement with Hungary on reconciliation 
in all spheres, putting their relations on a new basis. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Meciar] I discussed this issue with the Hungarian prime 
minister during our meeting in Prague. It is not possible to 
build on the past, while forever returning, in the negative 
sense, to what happened in the past. It is necessary to say 
that we are going to outline a new program for relations between 
the two states. It is necessary to declare clearly that we are 
interested in European integration and to respect these 
regulations in relations between us, too. [passage omitted] 
  Without a settlement of these relations and without 
embarking 
on cooperation and mutual integration, our integration into 
Western Europe is not possible--and, of course, no security 
structure would ever accept quareling neighbors. 
  [Bartisek] Can one say that both sides, Slovakia and 
Hungary, 
are going to meet each other halfway? 
  [Meciar] It would be premature to put it this way, but 
certainly the Slovak side has made an offer. [passage omitted] 
  [Bartisek] As prime minister, speaking about Radio Free 
Europe [RFE], private stations, or, rather, already paralyzed 
Slovak radio, which one do you prefer as your source of 
information? 
  [Meciar] I have not listened to RFE since 1989. It is their 
problem how they [word indistinct] report current affairs, but, 
as far as I know, they are being listened to by 1.04 percent of 
the population of the Slovak Republic. And they have to put not 
insignificant money into it. However, this is a matter for RFE. 
  While tuning, I sometimes catch one of the private stations. 
I have a habit, perhaps a negative or perhaps a positive one, of 
working with the radio on in the background. My radio is on 
constantly. 
  I do not think that Slovak radio is in bad shape. I think it 
is in a phase of looking for its identity, its new 
organizational structure; rationalization of its management is 
under way. This may improve its conditions. Of course, if 
certain steps are taken as regards the management, the 
government will come to help. We, more or less, are just 
watching to see how you are coping with some internal matters. 
I can say that most frequently I listen to Slovak radio. You 
are not in such a bad situation. It is necessary to be aware of 
the fact that you have embarked on a rather complicated internal 
struggle, and this always costs something. You need time to 
achieve consolidation. However, this is not unique to radio; it 
is something that can be applied to the entire state.

  [Text] Representatives of the Kovo trade union, which has 
280,000 trade unionists as members, have decided not to sign 
this year's general agreement with the government. Eugen 
Skultety, deputy chairman of the trade union, said the reason 
for the decision was the government's restrictive measures on 
price regulation due to come into force on 1 April. Citizens 
will not be able to cope with these measures, he said.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Zoran Andonovski: "The Circle Is Closed"] </F>
  [Text] The strategists of the U.S. State Department and 
the White House were probably not aware of what a small 
signature on the decision for recognition of Macedonia meant for 
the 2 million citizens "out there in the Balkans." It really is 
possible to paraphrase here the words of the first man who 
stepped on the moon -- Neil Armstrong -- "this may be a small 
step for the United States, but it is an enormous one for 
Macedonia." No matter which positions we start from in 
assessing the act of recognition and establishment of full 
diplomatic relations between Macedonia and the United States, it 
certainly is true it is of greatest political importance after 
the proclamation of the independence of Macedonia and its 
admission to the United Nations. Therefore, the process of 
international integration of Macedonia has come full circle, and 
Macedonia has passed a thorny road full of obstacles in 
confirming its own position, its own policy, its model of 
organized state in the last few years, always starting from the 
positions of a small but peaceful country in the center of the 
Balkans. 
  If Macedonia needed a final proof that the United States 
wants Macedonia to exist and survive, the proof is here. The 
Macedonian official foreign policy assessed the recognition as a 
logical ending of the efforts involved in the past period in 
persuading the world not only of the endurance, but also of the 
democratic orientation and peaceful policy of our country. The 
more emotional ones assess the great success of the Macedonian 
diplomacy as a jewel in the crown of the recognitions that 
Macedonia has experienced since the proclamation of its 
independence. It is an indisputable fact that the diplomatic 
strategy and tactics applied in the past period produced results 
and that the meticulous and cautious policy convinced all those 
who were skeptical. There is also the fact that the biggest and 
most influential economic, political, and military force in the 
world, by recognizing Macedonia, made it clear that Macedonia is 
in its interest, and that it will contribute to the promotion of 
stability in the region by this act. If we assess the 
activities of the Macedonian diplomacy, we must admit that the 
success is even greater because it was achieved without any 
preconditioning by the state which, to be honest, could have 
afforded that. Therefore, by recognizing Macedonia, the United 
States confirmed its policy of principles, which some had 
started to doubt. The United States started this confirmation 
with the sponsoring of our membership in the United Nations, 
with its support for our inclusion in international financial 
institutions, and with humanitarian and technical aid, getting 
now to a logical ending. By doing that, it made clear to 
everyone that the independence and stability of Macedonia is in 
its interest, too, and a factor and a condition for solving a 
part of the problems in the region. 
  In that context we must speak of what postponed, and 
sometimes made uncertain the achievement of equality between the 
world's most powerful force and the small country in the Balkans 
-- the dispute with Greece. That was exactly the reason for 
blocking the recognition of peaceful Macedonia. All our pleas 
for cooperation, mutual respect for territorial integrity of 
neighbors, and respect for borders, remained in the shadow of 
that dispute. Resilience and honesty was shown by Macedonia in 
innumerable practical examples, and now the United States 
accepted it not as a verbal mimicry, but as an autochtonous 
policy with deep roots in the behavior and practice of our 
country. 
  Therefore, the recognition of Macedonia by the United States 
is really multifaceted. If it is a message to Macedonia that 
its model of state organization is functional and applicable for 
the Balkans, that can also be a message to the other countries 
in this region and at large, that it is possible to endure and 
survive in merely impossible conditions via a sincere and 
good-neighborly and peaceful policy. The support of the United 
States for Macedonian policy is exceptionally important and it 
can contribute to a faster and more efficient settlement of the 
problems which emerged in the relations with Greece. With this 
act of recognition it was once again reaffirmed that an open and 
direct dialogue is the only possible and correct way of 
constructing good neighborliness and measures of mutual 
confidence. That is why good will is needed, which is the only 
possible way of solving the open questions in the mutual 
relations, through a constructive spirit and indispensable 
flexibility from both sides. Macedonia has practically been 
sending this message since the very beginning of the problems, 
which has been accepted by almost the whole international 
community. 
  Undoubtedly, the act of the United States represents a 
certain closing of the circle of recognition of the Republic of 
Macedonia, initiated with the admission of our country into the 
United Nations. Macedonia has been now recognized by all five 
permanent member countries of the UN Security Council, and it is 
quite normal to expect the other members of the United Nations, 
like Canada, Australia, and others, of vital interest for 
Macedonia, to recognize it and establish full diplomatic 
relations with Macedonia. 
  Besides the pleasure, there is also the obligation of 
Macedonia to continue on the same road which ensured its 
international identification and to be constantly open to all 
initiatives leading to peace, cooperation, and mutual confidence 
in the Balkans.

  [Excerpt] Skopje, 14 Feb (TANJUG) -- Kiro Gligorov, 
president of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and 
Vitaliy Churkin, special envoy of the Russian president, said in 
Skopje today that the conflicts in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the 
former Yugoslavia should be resolved by political means. 
  This is what Churkin told reporters after his talks with 
Gligorov. Churkin cautioned that any kind of escalation of war 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina would have consequences for the entire 
Yugoslav area and that the conflict might even spread beyond the 
borders of the former Yugoslavia. 
  The special envoy of the Russian president, who is on a 
one-day visit to Skopje, said that Russia was the first to 
demand an end to the siege of Sarajevo but that Moscow continues 
to maintain that action ought to be confined to the legal 
framework of the UN Security Council, where clear and precise 
stands could be adopted and then implemented by the parties to 
the conflict. The means envisaged by UN documents should be 
used in order to secure the implementation of the UN Security 
Council's decisions, Churkin said. 
  The situation in Sarajevo is such that the demilitarization 
of the city is needed as well as the lifting of the siege. If 
the demilitarization and the lifting of the blockade are not 
implemented, air strikes will follow, but that will also mean an 
escalation of conflicts with unforeseeable consequences, the 
special envoy pointed out. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Defense Is Ready"] </F>
  [Text] Major General Zivomir Ninkovic, commander of the 
air force and antiaircraft defense of the Srpska republic army, 
said that there is no real reason, neither political nor 
military, for anyone to directly attack a people. He stressed, 
therefore, that "I do not believe that the NATO threat will be 
realized." 
  In an interview with GLAS SRPSKI, Ninkovic said that if, 
however, the aggression were to take place, "we must not bow, we 
must defend ourselves and succeed at it." 
  Therefore, if the threat is carried out, it will mean that 
we 
have been forced into fighting. In that case, we would use all 
available means for defense, claims General Ninkovic.

Sarajevo Olympics: 
  [Begin Krajisnik recording] The international community -- 
the same one that 10 years ago, with its call for peace, 
entrusted to us the holding of the greatest international sports 
competition -- is today calling for bombing and war. It is 
threatening us, without any reason. It is threatening us 
because we are to blame for opposing denigration and 
destruction. We are guilty because we wanted, like all other 
peoples of the former Yugoslavia, to preserve our freedom and 
state. We will reply to their ultimatums in the same way as our 
forebears did. We do not accept the ultimatum. We want freedom 
and peace. We have opted for freedom and are resolved to defend 
the honor of the Serb nation with all available means. [end

  [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 14 (AFP) -- UN General Michael Rose on 
Monday [14 February] said he was determined to enforce a "total 
exclusion zone" of heavy weapons around the Bosnian capital 
Sarajevo, as an agreed arms handover ground to a halt. 
  Rose, commander of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in 
Bosnia, said all heavy weapons within 20 kilometres (12 miles) 
of Sarajevo "will either come under UNPROFOR control or will be 
subject to air attack." 
  The decision applied "to all weapons, it doesn't matter 
which 
army is in possession," he added, dispelling doubts about 
differences on the issue between the UN and the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organisation. 
  Last Wednesday NATO said both sides faced airstrikes if they 
did not withdraw heavy weapons from positions around Sarajevo or 
place them under UN supervision. Since then, some observers 
have questioned whether UNPROFOR was too lenient in allowing 
Serb forces to put heavy guns under "observation" rather than 
handing them over to full UN control. 
  Since Friday the Moslem-led Bosnian army has put 10 mortar 
guns under full UN control. The Serbs have put 33 of their guns 
under UN observation, but at Serb barracks. 
  No arms handover from either side took place on Monday, but 
negotiations to unblock the process were continuing, UNPROFOR 
spokesman Richard Pernod said at a press conference.

  [Excerpts] Brussels, Feb 14 (AFP) -- The North Atlantic 
Treaty Organisation is largely satisfied with a four-day-old 
ceasefire around the Bosnia-Herzegovina capital of Sarajevo, a 
senior NATO official said here Monday [14 February]. 
  NATO deputy secretary-general Sergio Silvio Balanzino told 
journalists: "For the time being we notice with satisfaction 
that the truce, the ceasefire, is being by and large respected." 
  The ceasefire began on Thursday one day after NATO warned 
that it would launch air strikes against Bosnian Serb artillery 
encircling Sarajevo unless it was withdrawn or placed under 
United Nations control by midnight next Sunday. 
  But Balanzino brushed aside a question about demands from 
the 
Bosnian Serbs that they should be allowed to retain the 
artillery in their own quarters, subject to UN surveillance, 
instead of physically handing the weapons over. 
  "The goal is to have the guns and heavy weapons put under 
control. Now there could be a variety of controls. As to 
techniques, these are steps to be worked out," Balanzino said, 
refusing to elaborate any further. [passage omitted] 
  A senior UN officer warned in Sarajevo that air strikes were 
inevitable if no substantial withdrawal of the Serb guns had 
taken place by Friday.

  [Text] This morning is marked by persistent Chetnik 
provocations along some defense lines of Sarajevo -- 
particularly the area of Sokolje, which early this morning was 
exposed to fire from a death sower [M-84 machine gun] from the 
direction of Rajlovac. The same area was shelled by 60-mm 
mortars and later came under antiaircraft-gun fire. 
  Meanwhile, the Chetniks from (Lemizovo Brdo) were hurling 
grenades at the area of Izvor. 
  Chetnik snipers have also been used this morning; the one on 
Spicasta Stijena has been particularly active. Citizens are 
warned to be cautious if they must move around the city. 
  The Chetniks have not only violated the cease-fire this 
morning but have also been seen openly reinforcing their 
positions on several locations from where they can attack the 
city.

  [Text] Zvornik, Bratunac, 15 Feb (TANJUG) -- The cease-fire 
agreement for the Sarajevo area has been mainly respected, 
TANJUG learned today from Serb Republic army representatives. 
  According to the same source, the Serb side has been 
directly 
contributing to the implementation of the cease-fire agreement. 
However, the Muslim side has opened infantry fire on the Serb 
side over the last 24 hours from positions in Dobrinja II and 
Dobrinja III and has targeted Serb defense lines on Sanac hill 
and residential areas near the Grbavica stadium. 
  Serb sources cited UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] 
representatives who had confirmed Muslim building of 
fortifications in the Zuc and Mojmilo areas yesterday. 
  However, the Muslims have resumed reinforcing their 
positions 
in several areas in an attempt to approach Serb positions under 
UNPROFOR protection, Serb military sources warned reporting that 
positions were being reinforced in Dobrinja III, in the area 
between Mojmilo and Sucur Kuce and in the Jewish cemetery. 
  Identical operations to reinforce positions have also been 
registered between Golo Brdo and Ugorsko and between Radovica 
Kuce and Dobrinja Potok, Nedjarici, and Aerodromsko Naselje. 
  The Serb side has informed the UNPROFOR command about this 
and the UNPROFOR command's representatives already stated that 
the building of trenches represented a cease-fire violation.

<F P=106> [Report by R. Kovacevic: "Milovanovic: Air Strikes Would </F>
Not Pay Off"] 
  [Text] Sarajevo, 12 Feb -- "Air strikes against Serbian 
positions will not pay off for the possible attackers," chief of 
staff of the Srpska republic army Major General Manojlo 
Milovanovic assessed today. 
  Stressing that the military leadership had assessed the 
threat of NATO air strikes very seriously, and adding that NATO 
represented a very respectable force, he warned that the 
attacking squadrons would not be able to sustain the losses that 
the artillery units of the Srpska republic army would inflict on 
them during each sortie. General Milovanovic believes that of 
the 60 to 70 NATO planes that would "fly per sortie," at least 
every tenth plane would not return to base. 
  The Srpska republic army command is aware that NATO pilots, 
who have been flying over Bosnia for months, have photographed 
every detail and every inch of the territory. In addition to 
this, they have been trained for various operations. However, 
the antiaircraft defense of the Srpska republic army also had to 
prepare appropriate counter measures and tactics, including 
permanent and reserve radar stations, some of which even "cover" 
the area of the Adriatic Sea and some neighboring countries. 
The antiaircraft units will also rely on the extremely 
sophisticated electronic innovations and products of the 
industry in the Srpska republic. 
  The Srpska republic army also possesses a significant number 
of artillery pieces that have so far been used in battle for 
targets on the ground, but the crews have also been 
exceptionally well trained for their basic assignments. Their 
combat readiness is at a peak, as if the air strikes are going 
to commence right away. 
  The heavy snowfalls over Sarajevo in recent days have 
prevented NATO patrols from carrying out even routine control 
flights from the "Deny Flight" plan.

  [Text] Sarajevo, February 14 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serbs want 
peace in Sarajevo, President of the Parliament of the Bosnian 
Serb republic Momcilo Krajisnik said on Monday and added that 
control of heavy artillery was in their interest. 
  "It is precisely because of the lack of such control that we 
have been unfoundedly accused so far," he said [word indistinct] 
a meeting with Andrea Colombo, head of the International 
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) European Office, in the 
Bosnian Serb political centre of Pale. 
  The two sides discussed humanitarian and political issues. 
  Krajisnik said he had conveyed to the ICRC official the 
stand 
of the Bosnian Serb leadership that the latest threat with NATO 
air strikes was "not an ultimatum to the Serb side because such 
a category in relations with the Serbian people is out of the 
question." 
  "We believe that this is pressure aimed at restoring peace 
in 
Sarajevo and controlling heavy weapons so that it could be 
established who initiates conflicts in this area," he said. 
  Krajisnik added that Colombo had informed him about visits 
of 
ICRC teams to prisons under Moslem control and promised to do 
everything in his power to ensure the earliest possible exchange 
of prisoners. 
  "Mr Colombo assured me that not a single member of the ICRC 
missions working in this area would leave our territory after 
NATO's ultimatum," he said. 
  Colombo said his visit was aimed at intensifying 
humanitarian 
operations in the entire area of the former Yugoslav republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which entailed cooperation of all sides. 
  "I must point out the cooperativeness of the Serb side, 
which 
today again agreed to participate in the realisation of our 
programme," said Colombo.

  [Text] Geneva, Feb 12 (TANJUG) -- Co-chairman of the 
conference on former Yugoslavia Thorvald Stoltenberg stated on 
Saturday that peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina was nearer now that 
the three warring sides agreed that the action plan of the 
European Union (E.U.) would serve as the basis of future 
negotiations. 
  At the close of three-day talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina in 
Geneva on Saturday, Stoltenberg told newsmen that this plan 
presumes a union of the three (Serb, Croat, Moslem) republics in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Moslem republic would cover 33.56 per 
cent of the total territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, while the 
U.N. and E.U. would take up administration over Sarajevo and 
Mostar, respectively. 
  Representatives of the three warring sides agreed to meet 
again in Geneva late February or early March. 
  Bosnian Moslems accepted a two-year U.N. administration of 
Sarajevo, but only within an integral peace solution for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina -- not a "separate agreement", Stoltenberg 
explained. 
  Stoltenberg favourably appraised the fact that a debate was 
raised about territories as the most delicate question. As was 
originally planned, the confidence and security build-up 
measures alone should have been discussed, while the opening of 
hot-lines amongst the three military commands was agreed. 
  The delegation heads of the three warring sides have not 
resolved the problems of 15 controversial territories. As 
Stoloenberg put it, the Moslems and Croats still lacked the 
common language about seven towns in central Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
and so did the Serbs and Moslems concerning eight localities in 
eastern and western Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Stoltenberg said it was significant that the latest round of 
talks at least clarified the general concept of a future 
Bosnia-Herzegovina so that all the sides had now accepted the 
idea of a union of three republics. 
  It was also accepted that the Serb-Moslem talks at Sarajevo 
Airport should resume, while the Croat-Moslem group for Mostar 
should meet on February 16 to work out the details concerning 
the E.U. administration of this town. 
  Stoltenberg was confident that the U.S. would favourably act 
on the outcome of the peace talks when he recalled that he and 
Lord Owen, as co-chairmen of the conference on ex-Yugoslavia, 
had long lacked support in their negotiation efforts before the 
more active inclusion into this process of the E.U. in November 
and December, and, most recently, of the U.S. and the Russian 
Federation. 
  Asked whether he feared the U.S. might come out with a 
proposal that should annull the E.U. action plan, Stoltenberg 
answered that he only was disturbed by the fact that peace was 
not yet achieved. 
  He said that he was ready to welcome and accept every 
solution that might step up this proces, and added that the 
American administration's stand clearly revealed that the U.S. 
was upholding the basic ideas in the E.U. peace plan.

  [Text] Zagreb, Feb 14 (AFP) -- Eleven battle tanks will 
make a new effort to reach United Nations troops in the enclave 
of Tuzla, northeast Bosnia, Tuesday [15 February], after being 
held up for nearly five months, the UN command said here. 
  One hundred Danish troops will accompany the German-designed 
Leopards, the first heavy tanks to be used by the UN Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia-Herzegovina, from Split in southern 
Croatia, the UN force said Monday. 
  The tanks were moved to Split to try to reach Tuzla from the 
south three weeks ago, after being prevented for four months by 
the Serbian authorities from leaving Pancevo, near Belgrade, on 
the grounds that they were offensive weapons. 
  Tuzla, held by the mainly-Moslem Bosnian armed forces, is 
being besieged by Bosnian Serb forces, who are resisting 
international pressure to reopen the airport there to 
humanitarian flights. 
  The Leopards will first head for Tomislavgrad in southwest 
Bosnia, which is under the control of Bosnian Croat militia, 
pending further orders from UNPROFOR. 
  They are destined for the 1,000-strong Nordic battalion of 
UNPROFOR in Tuzla.

  [Text] Geneva, Feb 15 (AFP) -- The United Nations refugees 
office is avoiding "non-essential" visits to Bosnia by its staff 
before the NATO ultimatum comes into effect this weekend, a 
spokeswoman said on Tuesday [15 February]. 
  UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako Ogata has 
delayed a visit to the former Yugoslavia planned for this week 
because of current tensions, Sylvana Foa said. 
  The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation said last Wednesday 
that all heavy weapons should be withdrawn from around Sarajevo 
or handed over to UN control within 10 days, or they would be 
bombed. 
  "We are not sending non-essential personnel to areas where 
there could be problems (...) but all essential personnel remain 
in place," said Foa. 
  Asked about their safety in the case of a possible NATO 
airstrike, she said there were "contingency plans for every 
situation, but we feel rather comfortable" about it at the 
moment. 
  However the UNHCR was worried about the situation in Mostar, 
in southern Bosnia, where Croatian shelling has claimed many 
victims, she added. 
  Aid convoys to east Mostar, under Moslem control, had been 
blocked by snow which made it hard to detect landmines. 
"Incessant" bombing by Bosnian Croats had caused 37 deaths and 
130 injuries in the first five days of February. 
  "Fifty thousand people in East Mostar are living literally 
like rats in cellars, without water, electricity or sanitation," 
said Foa. 
  In west Mostar, at a psychiatric hospital, around 100 
patients were caught in crossfire between the two camps. 
Despite local authority promises, it was still proving 
impossible to move these patients to another site in a 
Croat-controlled zone, she said. 
  The Moslem enclave of Bihac in western Bosnia was another 
black spot, the target of heavy Serb bombing since February 6 
which had caused at least six deaths and 100 injuries in its 
first few days. 
  This offensive disrupted the distribution of food aid to the 
region, which had been effective until now, and the UNCHR feared 
"large movements of displaced persons" as a result, the 
spokeswoman said.

  [Text] Geneva, Feb 15 (TANJUG) -- Fierce Muslim-Croat 
fighting on Tuesday prevented humanitarian convoys of the U.N. 
High Commessariat for Refugees (UNHCR) from entering Mostar, 
city in southwest Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  UNHCR spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said in Geneva that the 
convoys 
were unable to enter both the eastern (Muslim) and western 
(Croat) parts of Mostar. 
  A mental hospital, with some 100 patients, is in the Croat 
part of the city and under constant sniper fire, Foa said. 
  Thirty-seven people, including five children, were killed in 
Mostar in the February 1-5 period, while scores of civilians 
were wounded, she said. 
  Foa confirmed that the humanitarian convoys, which left 
Belgrade on Monday and crossed Bosnian Serb territory without 
mishap, had arrived in the Muslim enclaves of Tuzla and 
Srebrenica (northeast and eastern Bosnia). 
  Relief aid convoys for the Bosnian Muslims are regularly 
provided free and unhindered passage through Bosnian Serb 
territory, official UNHCR and U.N. Protection Force reports said. 
  Foa added that the severe snowstorms in central Bosnia on 
Tuesday stopped seven humanitarian convoys which left Metkovici 
(on the Adriatic coast) for Muslim-held Zenica.

foreign minister of Russia and special envoy of the Russian 
president, with "Russian television" "during his visit to 
Belgrade" on 13 February -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Studio announcer] During his visit to Belgrade, 
Vitaliy Churkin, deputy foreign minister of Russia and special 
envoy of the Russian president, gave an interview to Russian 
television. In the newscast we will show the part that refers to 
the massacre in Sarajevo [5 February] and Russia's 
interpretation of NATO's decision. The interview will be shown 
in full in the Svet Danas program today. 
  [Begin Churkin recording, in Russian with superimposed 
Serbo-Croatian translation] I think that it is almost certain 
that this was not done by the Serbs, because, as a rule, if this 
were the Serbs, the experts who were investigating this case 
would have quickly come up with such conclusions. 
  It is necessary to demilitarize the area around Sarajevo. We 
envisage this as a two-way operation that does not apply to the 
Serbs alone, but also to the Muslims. Therefore, I think the 
international community will understand that not only this 
bloody wound of Sarajevo would begin to heal, but, in our view, 
better conditions would be created for a better political 
solution. 
  Therefore, the events that should happen in Sarajevo, its 
demilitarization, are in the interest of both the Serbs 
themselves and those who favor a political solution.

supports this position. I took the chance to warn Mr. Churkin 
of the offensive, the Serb offensive up there in Bihac, [words 
indistinct], and I asked him to use his influence to immediately 
stop the offensive. He promised to do what he could to have the 
attack stopped. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Mirza Sadikovic from Bihac] </F>
  [Excerpt] Early this morning, the criminal Mladic brought 
to the Bihac front units from (?Glamoc) which, supported by 
tanks, attacked our positions on the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau, 
Hasin Vrh, and the Bihac part of the front. 
  In addition to fierce tank and infantry attacks, the 
chetniks 
for the first time used helicopters on the Grmusko-Srbljanski 
plateau. Our soldiers are repelling all attacks, at the same 
time inflicting losses in manpower on the chetniks and letting 
them know that they will never subdue these areas. 
  While the members of the 5th Corps bleed for the ninth 
consecutive day as they struggle against the combined enemy of 
the Muslim people -- the Serbo-Montenegrin aggressor -- the 
members of the paramilitary forces of the so-called autonomous 
province of western Bosnia have attacked -- in a cowardly and 
devious manner -- the members of the [Bosnia-Herzegovina] Army 
in the region of (?Dodig) [words indistinct]. One of our 
soldiers was wounded, while three were tied up and taken to 
Velika Kladusa. This act has elicited more bitterness among the 
members of the 5th Corps and the local population, who say that 
they would all rather die than allow the implementation of the 
autonomists' or the chetniks' plans. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Affairs Ministry Spokesman Grzegorz </F>
Dziemidowicz by Maria Bninska at the Radio ESKA studio in Warsaw 
on the "Guest of ESKA" program--live] 
  [Text] [Bninska] NATO is slowly beginning to make decisions 
and speak about the possibility of bombarding Sarajevo. It is 
also beginning to discuss what Tadeusz Mazowiecki proposed a 
year and a half ago: the proposal to turn Sarajevo into a 
demilitarized zone. Do you think there is a possibility that 
NATO will eventually decide to use air strikes against the heavy 
artillery surrounding Sarajevo? 
  [Dziemidowicz] There is such a possibility and, as a matter 
of fact, NATO has for many months been studying whether or not 
to take firmer steps... 
  [Bninska, interrupting] It has been thinking about it, but 
it 
has not taken any such steps. 
  [Dziemidowicz] Well, it is by no means a simple decision. On 
the one hand, everyone is saying....[Dziemidowicz pauses] The 
pressure of world public opinion is unequivocal. One cannot 
passively watch entire nations kill one another, watch them 
practically disappear as a consequence of all kinds of ethnic 
cleansing. On the other hand, launching military action--even 
limited action--entails the risk of further fueling this war, 
spreading it to other areas.... 
  [Bninska, interrupting] This is what Milosevic keeps saying. 
  [Dziemidowicz] It also threatens to fuel terrorism. It is 
difficult to take on such a responsibility and I understand the 
hesitation before the final decision is made. This decision 
certainly must be reached. The senseless slaughter in Bosnia 
must be stopped; however, despite all the lofty and nice 
headlines in newspapers, which say what should, ought, or must 
be done, the decisionmaking process is very complex and.... 
  [Bninska, interrupting] What does that work? Is global 
diplomacy based solely on money and interests? Now, in the case 
of the Gulf war and Iraq's annexation of Kuwait, the decision 
was made almost immediately. A few months after Iraqi troops 
invaded Kuwait, the Security Council gave its assent for the 
allied forces to retake Kuwait. In the case of Yugoslavia, no 
one has done anything for 22 months--aside from peace talks 
which have not yielded any results. Of what does global 
diplomacy really consist? 
  [Dziemidowicz] It is difficult to speak about diplomacy in 
the global dimension, of course. In every region, 
different--most often conflicting--interests come into play. 
However, in the case of Kuwait, the situation was rather simple: 
there was an invader and an invaded country. We can, of course, 
still talk about the various interests.... 
  [Bninska, interrupting] However, in the case of Somalia, the 
situation was not that simple. 
  [Dziemidowicz] Still, the decision was made relatively 
quickly, you must admit. It was backed by public support around 
the world and by practically all major politicians. The carrying 
out of this operation is a different story. Now, in the case of 
former Yugoslavia--because we are now speaking about the entire 
area--the situation is really quite equivocal. No one knows how 
to cope with this problem. We keep hearing threadbare 
expressions about the Balkan crucible, a keg of gunpowder. 
However, there is something about it: decades pass by and such 
a conflict cannot be settled. 
  [Bninska] Last week Poland signed the Partnership for Peace, 
which means that we are somewhere in the corridor of NATO. Now, 
in the case of making such a decision, does this partnership 
envision the following: if NATO decides to bombard Yugoslavia, 
and after all, we are closer to Yugoslavia than France for 
instance, will NATO hold any talks with Poland? I understand 
that it does not consult with us about such things, but does 
this Partnership for Peace envision Poland being informed before 
the media? 
  [Dziemidowicz] Definitely yes; yes, of course. The principle 
of nothing about us without us, is also binding in this case. I 
think that the mechanisms of protection, information, and 
consultations within the Partnership for Peace program will be 
discussed many times in the media: we have only just begun, we 
have only just joined this program, we have only just started 
the talks with our partners at NATO Headquarters, with the 
individual member states of the organization. Therefore, 
everything will gradually smooth itself out. The more support 
for our stance, for our readiness to take part in this program, 
we gain in these first few most important months, the more fruit 
we will receive later on. 
  [Bninska] Does the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MSZ] think 
NATO should use air strikes against Yugoslavia, especially in 
light of the recent massacre in Sarajevo? 
  [Dziemidowicz] I cannot give you an unequivocal answer to 
this question. The decision will certainly be broader. It will 
not be a decision made by one state or a group of states; it 
will be a decision for the Security Council; it may require a 
consensus. I do not think that one single state will take on the 
burden, not to mention the odium, of such a decision. 
  [Bninska] Do we have enough money to implement the 
Partnership for Peace? National Defense Minister Piotr 
Kolodziejczyk claims that this year we will need at least half a 
trillion zlotys, which the Ministry of National Defense [MON] 
simply does not have. How much does MSZ think will have to be 
spent on the program? 
  [Dziemidowicz] It may either be half a trillion or even 
several times as much. Partnership for Peace consists, among 
other things, in the fact that a state contributes to the 
program as much as it wants to or is prepared to contribute. We 
can take part in undertakings which we accept or which we 
initiate. Therefore, we do not necessarily have to look at these 
matters in terms of money.... 
  [Bninska, interrupting] However, how much is the government 
prepared to contribute? 
  [Dziemidowicz] Naturally, Minister Kolodziejczyk is right in 
saying that MON does not have this amount of money. The 
partnership was signed after the money was initially 
distributed. Thus, it is simply not possible for any 
decisionmaker in MON to pay this amount of money from the 
coffers of the ministry. It is certainly a decision for the 
government, and therefore.... 
  [Bninska, interrupting] Is MSZ prepared to pay this money? 
  [Dziemidowicz] MSZ will definitely not pay such a sum; 
however, it will participate in any expenditures related to the 
Partnership for Peace to a rational extent. 
  [Bninska] Is this Partnership for Peace profitable from our 
point of view? It entails spending a lot of money, taken out of 
our pockets, which probably means that teachers or physicians, 
for instance, will have a little less money. Will it pay off? 
What are we going to get in return? 
  [Dziemidowicz] At the beginning you mentioned this corridor. 
Now I will repeat the quotation that has been referred to many 
times: It is better to be in the corridor than out in the cold. 
I simply think that there is no alternative for Poland: it must 
join Western structures, that is, the European Union and NATO. 
We must do this for the future of our reforms, the process of 
democratization, and first of all, for the feeling of security 
for 40 million Poles. It is simply indispensable for us to join 
those structures. 
  [Bninska] As far as I remember, in the autumn of 1990 in 
Krakow, the Visegrad Group was established with a big bang. This 
Visegrad Group comprised Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary; 
apart from developing close economic cooperation, these three 
countries decided to build up political cooperation and make 
efforts to join West European structures. Does the Visegrad 
Group still exist? 
  [Dziemidowicz] Yes, it does. I will not say that it is in 
good shape; it is going through a crisis. However, I will say 
what Mark Twain once said: The rumors about the death of this 
group are quite premature. It is merely.... 
  [Bninska, interrupting] Is it angina or perhaps lung cancer? 
  [Dziemidowicz] I would say it is angina, but not in the most 
acute form. Please note that the public is being informed about 
very spicy details from the statements of various politicians 
which undermine.... 
  [Bninska, interrupting] Including the prime minister? 
  [Dziemidowicz] Which undermine, although not entirely, 
certain forms of the functioning of the Visegrad Group; we think 
that there are no such forms, such as the striving for 
institutionalization. Now, the Visegrad Group is functioning 
quite well. I am saying this on the basis of MSZ experience at 
lower levels, where consultations are held. In the individual 
countries where there are embassies of the four.... 
  [Bninska, interrupting] However, what do these consultations 
yield? 
  [Dziemidowicz] A lot. Many joint initiatives; first of all 
we 
inform one another about what we are going to do in this or that 
area. This is extremely important. 
  [Bninska] The agreement, signed a few years ago in Krakow, 
also envisioned the establishment of a duty-free zone between 
these three states. Has this zone been established? 
  [Dziemidowicz] This duty-free zone has already been 
established and it will be extended, or deepened, as it were. 
Namely, as the years go by, we will broaden the list of goods 
that can be bought or sold in Visegrad Group states without 
great difficulties. Also, as a result of internal discussions, 
the process of establishing the free trade zone has been 
expedited. At the beginning, in line with preliminary plans, the 
finalization of this project was supposed to be in the next 
century. Now we are certain that it is a matter of several years. 
  [Bninska] How did the Visegrad Group become ill? I 
understand that from the economic point of view, it is 
functioning so-so. Why is it not so that these states do not 
unanimously defend each other and each other's political 
interests? 
  [Dziemidowicz] I think that this is a kind of angina or mild 
flu which has affected the people and the political elites in 
this part of Europe. Namely, after the euphoria of 1989 or 1990, 
everything seemed to be clear and simple: we cooperate with one 
another, we are linked by common interests, we are striving for 
economic and political integration with the West at the same 
pace. At the very beginning, we probably failed to note that 
there are conflicts of interests among us as well; that our 
economies are not very compatible and that they are very similar 
and therefore competitive for similar groups of commodities; 
that all this calls for time. 
  [Bninska] What are the conflicting interests among Poland, 
Czechoslovakia, and Hungary? 
  [Dziemidowicz] If you are referring to political interests, 
I 
can see none. However, as for economic interests, there 
certainly are conflicts. We have similar commodities that we 
want to sell, either on each other's markets or on third markets. 
  [Bninska] The Czech Republic accused Poland of trying to be 
a 
kind of boss for this group, to be the best, and to submit the 
other two states... 
  [Bninska pauses] Three states--the Czech Republic, Slovakia, 
and Hungary to itself. Is this true? 
  [Dziemidowicz] I do not think that this is the truth. We 
certainly launched many initiatives; on many occasions we 
invited our partners to discussions on various problems. I think 
that this is simply normal and we will keep on doing this. 
Someone must come up with ideas. However, I think, or I am even 
positive that we are not at all trying to impose our point of 
view; we are rather trying to set off our common interests. 
  [Bninska] For a few days we have seen frictions between the 
Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] and the Polish Peasant Party 
[PSL]. Do these disputes affect the work of MSZ in any way? 
  [Dziemidowicz] No, they do not. However, I fear that as a 
result of them, commentaries less favorable to Poland may start 
coming in from abroad. We have not seen this as yet. The Pawlak 
government was rather popular with the foreign press, especially 
after the prime minister's visit to Brussels. I do not know yet 
what it will be like this time. 
  [Bninska] A subcommittee of the Sejm Foreign Affairs 
Committee has been established to check the personnel of MSZ. Do 
those who established it belong to the government? How is the 
ministry functioning within the coalition structure? 
  [Dziemidowicz] The ministry is functioning fairly well. The 
initiatives are quite varied. There has been a deputies' 
initiative concerning Poles living in Lithuania. Thus, I think 
that we will resolve many problems and.... 
  [Bninska, interrupting] Minister Olechowski was indignant at 
the establishment of this subcommittee. Has MSZ changed its 
mind? Will it want to cooperate with this subcommittee? Will 
this subcommittee be just like former verifications? 
  [Dziemidowicz] Deputy Micewski is going to meet with 
Minister 
Olechowski. I do not imagine that any binding decisions can be 
made without this talk talking place. 
  [Bninska] The creators of this concept of establishing the 
subcommittee claimed that personnel matters, concrete persons in 
concrete posts, would not be discussed. However, Deputy Micewski 
did not conceal that names may be mentioned there. Who is 
entitled to select employees for the ministry: the Sejm or the 
minister? 
  [Dziemidowicz] The personnel policy in the ministry is 
definitely carried out by the minister. One of his tasks, 
duties, and prerogatives is to appoint and recall employees: in 
other words, it is his personnel policy understood as a broad 
concept. There is also no doubt that the Sejm Foreign Affairs 
Committee is the organ with which the ministry is obliged to 
cooperate in various areas.... 
  [Bninska, interrupting] The committee also has sessions with 
candidates for ambassadors, does it not? 
  [Dziemidowicz] Exactly. It is also a body which issues 
opinions on ambassadorial candidates. 
  [Bninska] Do you think that this committee can directly or 
indirectly cause any changes in the various posts in the 
ministry? Is it so that the minister listens to the committee 
and then decides to do whatever he wishes? 
  [Dziemidowicz] Personnel policy is certainly the 
responsibility of the minister. However, let me reiterate that 
any suggestions, especially submitted by bodies which have been 
appointed to issue opinions on foreign policy, such as the 
committee, are quite important and taken into account in MSZ. 
  [Bninska] In those disputes between PSL and SLD, we have 
once 
again heard about the issue of political deputy ministers in the 
so-called presidential ministries. MSZ is one such ministry. 
Does MSZ see the possibility of turning the posts of under 
secretaries of state into political ones? 
  [Dziemidowicz] First of all, MSZ is just about to start the 
modernization process, that is, the adjustment of the ministry 
to criteria that are imposed on us by the interests of the 
Polish state, the necessity of strengthening the position of 
Poland among our neighbors, near and far, and the need to take a 
more economic look at the diplomatic service. I said we are just 
about to start this modernization. We hope that it will be 
started very soon, with the full consent of the government, of 
course. It must be preceded by discussions with the Foreign 
Affairs Committee. Minister Olechowski promised this to the 
deputies. Thus, it will be a broader discussion, a broader 
debate. We hope that as a result of it, we will shape a 
diplomatic service that will measure up to our needs, both 
today's and tomorrow's. 
  [Bninska] When you already have this new diplomatic service, 
do you think you will allow it to become political? 
  [Dziemidowicz] I do not think that will be necessary. 
However, the final shape does not depend on me. 
  [Bninska] Thank you very much for the interview. 
  [Dziemidowicz] Thank you.

  [Text] Warsaw, 15 Feb--Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrzej 
Olechowski received Field Marshal Richard Vincent, chairman of 
the NATO Military Committee, on Tuesday morning. 
  Andrzej Towpik, director of the MSZ [Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs] department for European institutions, told journalists 
after the meeting had ended that the conversation confirmed the 
openness of the NATO military personnel to both political and 
military cooperation with Poland. Towpik added that the 
conversation was devoted primarily to the Partnership for Peace 
concept. The status of the Polish presentation document, which 
is to be submitted before Poland joins the Partnership for Peace 
programme, was discussed. 
  Towpik emphasized that the partnership concept is a very 
broad program that requires constant discussion. In his opinion 
the Polish side is trying to understand the idea of partnership, 
and NATO representatives will learn in the course of this 
discussion that certain elements of the [Partnership for Peace] 
concept require more precise definition and explanation.

Government of the Polish Republic for European integration: 
"Warsaw's European Option"] 
  [Text] Poland remains committed to the vision of European 
construction extended to Central Europe which, over the last 
four years, has constituted the central idea of its foreign 
policy. Its principal objectives have been clearly identified: 
Poland's accession to Western security structures as well as 
those concerned with European economic and political 
integration. This aim is being fulfilled by developing close 
relations with the European Community, now the European Union, 
and with EFTA [European Free Trade Association], as well as by 
establishing special links with the Visegrad countries and 
consolidating very good relations with Poland's neighbors. 
  Poland's integration into the European Union remains of 
vital 
national interest. Poland needs a Union that is open to its 
neighbors in Central and Eastern Europe. The absence of such 
openness would signify the continuation of old divisions or the 
creation of new ones. We in Poland are expecting the 
intensification of trade links, the extension of political 
dialogue, an intensification of our participation in the 
mechanisms of European political cooperation, an adjustment in 
the level of support given to our efforts at transforming and 
modernizing our country, and the completion of the integration 
of Central Europe in the interests of both Western Europe and 
Poland itself. 
  Following the fall of Communism in 1989, Europe entered into 
a period of essential structural transformation, a complex, 
long-term process. In the eyes of the postcommunist countries, 
this process goes hand in hand with the task of defining their 
place within the new European structure. We are seeing an 
entirely unique opportunity presenting itself in Europe. 
Throughout its history, Europe has rarely been at peace and has 
never been unified. Now, the opportunity for a unification of 
this kind would appear to be emerging. This conjunction of new 
European realities, the awareness of new needs, and the 
possibility of creating a unique opportunity constitute a major 
challenge for the political architects of Europe. 
  In Central and Eastern Europe we are experiencing a rapid 
differentiation of the pace of political and economic 
transformation in its various parts. Poland and its partners in 
the Visegrad group (Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia) 
are already operating on the basis of principles identical to 
those of their Western partners. However, the general division 
of Europe is partially persisting: The Iron Curtain has turned 
into a line demarcating prosperity. 
<H5>  Tradesmen's Europe </H5>
  Although Europe has always been divided along the lines of 
the prosperity of its societies, this division is currently 
making itself most keenly felt as a result of the cessation of 
antagonism between the Western and Eastern blocs. It would be 
impossible to neglect this division. Such a socioeconomic 
variant of the old politico-military division of the continent 
is, in the longer term, exerting a destabilizing effect on 
Europe. The consequences of the illegal arms traffic, of 
organized crime, of uncontrolled migratory movements, of 
ecological catastrophes, and of the phenomena associated with 
economic crisis will not merely affect the eastern part of the 
continent. The appearance of a new wall would put an end, in 
the political sphere, to all that Europe has achieved since the 
changes of 1989-90 and that it has quite rightly raised to the 
rank of something of common value. 
  At present, we are witnessing three parallel phenomena in 
Europe: integration, the reemergence of nationalism, and 
intranational divisions. The process of Western European 
integration within the context of the European Union, initiated 
by the founding fathers of Europe--Robert Schumann, Jean Monnet, 
De Gasperi, Spaak, Adenauer--is currently undergoing a crisis in 
the eyes of the majority of elites in the countries belonging to 
the European Community. Integration still remains the primary 
objective, but sometimes we have the feeling that the notion of 
European construction, as it existed after World War II, has 
been lost sight of, and that we are moving toward a "tradesmen's 
Europe" rather than a "politically planned Europe." 
  Security policy in Europe is faced with new intellectual 
and structural challenges. The concepts of security that 
existed before 1989 boasted military significance, above all. 
Today, ecological and socioeconomic factors also have to be 
taken into account, and security is no longer viewed as a 
principle of conduct. Today, faced with the requirements to 
bring about systemic changes in the East as quickly as possible, 
and to accelerate the integration processes in the West, 
security is acquiring a new dimension, which is above all more 
dynamic. In Poland, help in achieving these transformations 
must be treated as an essential component of security policy, 
which takes nonmilitary factors into account in equal measure. 
  Unfortunately, the positive transformations which are being 
accomplished in Central and Eastern Europe have also brought to 
light the weaknesses of the countries involved, as well as the 
risks to which they are exposed. Neither the East nor the West 
were prepared for the emergence of new phenomena on such a large 
scale. It could even be said that we were all surprised, 
especially with regard to the pace and extent of these 
transformations. 
  So far, in international politics, no effective instruments 
have been devised for solving the nascent problems. Moreover, 
no system has been perfected for achieving harmonious links 
between the various countries' rights to self-determination and 
national sovereignty, on the one hand, while respecting ethnic 
and cultural peculiarities and reconciling the trends running 
counter to regional and global integration with the centrifugal 
mechanisms driven by ethnic and cultural imperatives, on the 
other. Consequently, during this crucial period, it is 
extremely important that we continue to be tireless in our 
search for the appropriate means to resolve the new, interlinked 
problems that are continually arising. It is important that all 
the parties concerned participate in this search. 
  The orientation toward the West and European integration 
have 
become the strategic linchpins of Polish foreign policy. The 
essential aim of this policy is to lend a durable and 
indissociable character to Poland's political, economic, 
cultural, and civilization-related ties with the Western world. 
We must ensure that the Polish presence becomes a durable 
feature of the institutions and system of European integration, 
so that our country becomes an indispensable constituent of this 
system. That would constitute the best guarantee of Polish 
development within the context of European construction, with 
which we identify.

  [Text] Warsaw, 14 Feb--Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak 
received this afternoon Lojze Peterle, deputy premier and 
foreign minister of the Republic of Slovenia. 
  After the meeting, the Slovenian diplomat told journalists 
that Prime Minister Pawlak had expressed interest in closer 
cooperation with Slovenia, in particular in the economic field. 
According to Peterle, both sides spoke in favor of strengthening 
economic cooperation in the whole of Central Europe, at the same 
time admitting that there was still a lot to be done "with 
regard to economic reforms." 
  The Slovenian minister confirmed the willingness to conclude 
an agreement on free trade with Poland. Slovenia already 
concluded similar agreements with the Czech Republic and 
Slovakia and will soon sign one with Hungary. "It seems that the 
expansion of the free trade zone is necessary, as it makes our 
access to the European Union easier," he said. 
  Peterle announced that Polish-Slovenian political 
cooperation 
would concentrate on the forum of the Central-European 
Initiative. He said that there were good foundations for this 
cooperation, as both states had similar views on Europe and the 
issue of security.

<F P=106> [Article by Sylwester Walczak, from New York, and Maria </F>
Wagrowska: "WASHINGTON POST: Poland Sold Soviet Arms to the 
United States; Speculations or Facts"] 
  [Text] "In the 1980's the United States bought in Poland 
the newest systems of Soviet arms which could not be obtained in 
any other manner, with the tacit approval of the Polish Defense 
Ministry [MON]," claims THE WASHINGTON POST. "It is impossible 
that anyone in Poland could agree to such transactions," stress 
the interlocutors of RZECZPOSPOLITA. According to them, Poland 
has never had the Soviet military technology of the newest 
generation. It is possible, however, that the Soviet arms were 
purchased by the West in the Near East, or that Polish products 
got there through Cenzin [company licensed to transact arms 
deals]. 
  "Poland was a crevice in the Soviet arms," stated the Monday 
[14 February] WASHINGTON POST, quoting anonymous intelligence 
sources. "In the 1980's the United States purchased in Poland 
the newest systems of the Soviet arms which they could not 
obtain in any other manner. With the help of CIA, the Pentagon 
tried to make such purchases in all the states of the former 
Warsaw Pact, but the greatest number of arms was obtained in 
Poland," claims the author of the article, Benjamin Weiser. The 
weapons were bought for intelligence purposes -- the Americans 
wanted to get an idea of how advanced Soviet military technology 
was. They bought in Poland the newest Soviet air defense 
systems, radars, helicopters, torpedoes, tanks, and 
self-propelled guns; they paid for all this between $150 million 
and $200 million. 
  According to Retired General Edward "Shy" Meyer, who 
supervised the purchase program from 1979 to 1983, it was the 
cheapest way to obtain the newest systems of the Soviet arms. 
  The Americans made the transactions by means of middlemen; 
they paid money by means of letters of credits to bank accounts 
in third countries. In the case of Poland, the money was sent to 
Cenzin, which deals with the sale of arms. According to the 
Washington daily, even though there is no direct evidence that 
General... 
<H5>  Wojciech Jaruzelski Was Involved in the Transactions </H5>
  ...they had to be made with the tacit approval of the Polish 
defense minister. There were too many transactions and they 
always went off very smoothly, overcoming any bureaucratic 
obstacles. This proves that the order was given up high, claims 
the anonymous intelligence source of THE WASHINGTON POST. 
  General Wojciech Jaruzelski denied that such transactions 
could actually happen; he called them "almost entirely 
improbable" and risky. According to Jaruzelski, the Russians 
guarded their newest arms systems which they had sold to Poland, 
and the Polish Government would not have agreed that they be 
sold to the United States. However, the general did not rule out 
the possibility that the arms leaked to the United States 
through third countries. 
  The CIA spokesman refused to make any comments; however, 
other intelligence sources confirmed that in the 1980's Poland 
was the greatest source of Soviet arms for the United States. 
  The Americans started this operation in late 1970s, when 
they 
bought moving anti-aircraft systems in Romania for $40 million. 
The transaction was arranged by brothers of the dictatorial 
Nicolae Ceausescu -- one of them was the Romanian defense 
minister. CIA made its first purchase in Poland in early 1980s; 
it paid between $20 million and $30 million for over 1,000 hand 
anti-aircraft rockets which were later on given to... the Afghan 
guerrillas (this was before they were equipped with the American 
Stingers). Poland also sold the Americans anti-chemical 
equipment, which was used by the Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan; 
thanks to this the Americans knew what weapons were being used 
there by the Russians. One of the main transactions came in 
1987: the purchase, through the German Democratic Republic and 
Czechoslovakia, of 12 T-72 tanks, which the Pentagon had not 
been able to obtain in any way before. Another important 
purchase was also the newest Soviet air-defense system, bought 
by CIA at the time when power in Poland had already been taken 
over by the Mazowiecki government, but Jaruzelski was the 
president and MON was still controlled by the communists. 
  The arms, which later reached the United States, were often 
supposed to be destined for Syria or Libya. It once happened 
that officers met in Western Europe with CIA agents and 
discussed the conditions of the transactions, writes THE 
WASHINGTON POST. The daily claims that the main motive of the 
Poles was either the desire to obtain hard currency, or perhaps 
also the desire of some highly- placed employees of MON to 
"protect themselves for the future." 
  The purchases that the Americans made in Poland were of 
great 
intelligence value for them. It is enough to say that after they 
saw the details of the newest Soviet radars, they greatly 
improved the "Stealth" technology, which made it possible for 
them to build aircraft undetected by radars. 
  In the meantime, Colonel Marian Moraczewski, Polish military 
attache in Washington, told the correspondent of RZECZPOSPOLITA 
that he knows nothing about the transactions described in THE 
WASHINGTON POST and that he has nothing to say about this 
matter. "Perhaps Cenzin, as a trade company, made some kind of 
transactions; however, it is very unlikely that this happened on 
such a scale." 
  According to Colonel Moraczewski, the Polish Government 
could not take part in such operations; these transactions, in 
turn, were not possible if the government did not know about 
them, because "the Defense Ministry is a highly centralized 
structure." "The fuss that is being made about it is 
unnecessary now," said Colonel Moraczewski; he added that such a 
publication would certainly make Poland's eastern neighbors more 
suspicious. 
  "No one knows anything certain in this matter," 
RZECZPOSPOLITA learned from its interlocutors, while trying to 
obtain some comments on the publication in THE WASHINGTON POST. 
<H5>  "We Can Only Speculate" </H5>
  ...we were told by a high official connected to the 
authorities in the 1980's, who wants to remain anonymous; 
however, the entire affair seems improbable. 
  "This is total nonsense," RZECZPOSPOLITA learned from 
General 
Tadeusz Kusmierski, who fulfilled the function of the main 
inspector of the technology of the Polish Army for some time 
beginning in 1989. "I am just wondering who is interested in 
advertising the affair and for what reasons. Nothing definitely 
came out of the Polish Army; now, it is simply impossible to say 
whether or not some arms were obtained by the West indirectly. 
Foreign intelligence services use various methods. Never, I will 
stress this word, never," said General Kusmierski, "did the 
Soviet Union sell the newest weapons to Poland or to other 
states of the Warsaw Pact. When we bought weapons from the 
Soviet Union, we were always aware of the fact that we were 
purchasing arms of an older generation and that the Soviet Union 
had newer technology at its disposal. Now, what Poland was 
manufacturing was no great revelation," he admitted. The former 
MON employee told us that in the 1980's Poland had only one 
company equipped with T-72 tanks; in general, it had only T-55 
tanks at its disposal. Moreover, the rocket weaponry and combat 
aircraft that Poland had were much more obsolete in comparison 
with the Soviet Union. 
  All our interlocutors were unanimous in saying that the only 
way that the Soviet arms could reach the United States was 
through... 
<H5>  The Original Sale of Them to Third Countries </H5>
  According to our informers, there were two ways the West 
could come into possession of the weapons used by the Polish 
Army: 
  First: The intelligence services of a Western state, not 
necessarily those of the United States, were able to skillfully 
approach the proper Polish establishments. By presenting a 
fictitious company, they, or rather the company, could argue 
that the weaponry was needed by some independence organization, 
some liberation movement in the Third World. In the opinion of 
our interlocutor, it could have been then that the political 
decision concerning the sale could be made. In such a case, only 
Cenzin's predecessor and the military special services could 
know about the possibility of exporting the arms. 
  The second possibility, which is considered to be the most 
probable, is access to the Soviet and Polish weapons in 
countries outside of Europe, mainly in the states of the Near 
East. "The Americans had access," stated General Kusmierski, "to 
Soviet weaponry mainly in Israel, Syria, and Egypt, where it was 
left as a result of the warfare between Israel and Arabic 
countries. Poland exported tanks and helicopters to Syria and 
Libya. The former MON employee told us that the Near East and 
India usually had more modern Soviet equipment than Poland did. 
  Wlodzimierz Lozinski, a close aide of Wojciech Jaruzelski 
who 
maintains contacts with him, as well as the interpreter during 
the interview with the author of the text in the American daily, 
remembers the general's statements very well. Jaruzelski assured 
Weiser that he did not know anything about whether or not MON 
gave anyone in the West any weapons or technical and 
technological blueprints. 
  "However, in his interview for THE WASHINGTON POST, the 
general did not rule out the possibility," we were told by 
Lozinski, "that the weapons could be exported to third countries 
and were intercepted by the Americans." In view of the fact 
that the author of the article quotes CIA sources, it is 
difficult to polemize with him. 
  MON Spokesman, Colonel Wieslaw Rozbicki told the television 
"Wiadomosci" that the ministry had been taken aback by the 
publication in THE WASHINGTON POST, and as a consequence, it was 
not prepared to respond to the article. He does not say, 
however, either "yes" or "no"; he must first verify everything.

<F P=106> [Article by Igor Zalewski: "Hall Calls For Unification of </F>
Forces"] 
  [Text] In the local government elections, the "post-August 
1980" forces should together oppose the Democratic Left Alliance 
and the Polish Peasant Party, according to Conservative Party 
leader Aleksander Hall. 
  Speaking at a news conference on Saturday [12 February], 
Hall 
very sharply criticized the achievements of the Pawlak 
Government so far. "Those who thought this government would 
continue the work of its predecessors should take a closer look. 
There is no question of a sensible alternative to this 
government, either," he said. 
  In Hall's opinion, the government has failed to present a 
scenario for any sphere of public life. The Conservative leader 
also criticized the Pawlak Government's personnel policy. 
"People are selected on the basis of political criteria, rather 
than professional criteria. Persons who gained notoriety under 
the People's Republic are receiving back high-ranking posts," he 
said. He viewed the latest conflict inside the coalition as 
evidence of a lack of elementary political culture and an 
inability to think in terms of the state. 
  In view of the strength of the postcommunist camp, the 
forces 
of "Post-August Poland" must seek an accord, Hall said. The June 
local government elections are going to be trial of strength for 
them. 
  Next, the post-Solidarity parties should produce a single 
candidate in the presidential elections strong enough to oppose 
left-wing candidates, Hall said. In his opinion, if the 
Solidarity groups fail to get together, they will suffer another 
calamity. A Solidarity presidential candidate must have a 
political program, said Hall. He must possess the image of a 
statesman, and have enough prestige to gather the broadest 
possible support. Last but not least, he must appeal to the 
voters. 
  "Kazimierz Ujazdowski only took a small number of activists 
away from the Conservative Party, even though these were good 
people," said Hall. "So there is no question of any 
disintegration of the Conservative Party. We have merely lost 
the Lower Silesian constituency, that is all." He said he had 
no intention of returning to the Democratic Union but, as head 
of the Conservative Party, he wants to "guard and champion 
conservative values," even if such an attitude causes a 
temporary crisis among the Conservatives.

<F P=106> [Article by "Igo": "The ZChN Wants a Center-Right-Wing </F>
Confederation"] 
  [Text] The Christian-National Union [ZChN] authorities 
have said they would like to see the present right-wing 
coalition, consisting of the ZChN, Center Accord, Peasant 
Accord, and Movement for the Republic, develop into a 
confederation in which each of these parties would retain its 
identity and organizational independence. The confederation 
would have a strong leading body, which would bear its own 
separate name. Until now, the right-wing coalition has been 
informally called the "tripartite" agreement, and then the 
"quadripartite" agreement after the Movement of the Republic 
joined it. 
  Some ZChN politicians--Marek Jurek, Marian Pilka, and 
Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz--have suggested an even stronger link 
between the coalition components. They would like to see a joint 
federative group emerge as early as June. So would Center Accord 
leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski. 
  But the ZChN Main Board adheres to the view of ZChN chairman 
Wieslaw Chrzanowski, who is not very eager to see a single party 
emerge quickly. Chrzanowski says that before such a party can be 
formed, there has to be a joint programmatic declaration and an 
increase in mutual trust between the coalition parties at all 
levels. The Main Board issued a statement to this effect. 
  Although the proposals of Marian Pilka and Kazimierz 
Marcinkiewicz go further than this, they are satisfied with the 
Main Board statement, so that the old conflict within the ZChN 
seems to have been resolved.

<F P=106> [Interview with National Security Bureau Chief Jerzy </F>
Milewski by Piotr Swiac, of the "Directly From the Belweder" 
program; place and date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Swiac] Mr. Minister, you have initiated a program 
of changes within the supreme state institutions in the area of 
defense and security. Do you not think that we should put this 
very important issue on hold until a new constitution is enacted? 
  [Milewski] No, I do not think so because the lack of 
statutory and constitutional provisions in this area is quite 
troublesome--I would even say it is dangerous--for the country's 
defense system and its security. This should--and can--be 
remedied as soon as possible so as not to leave the issue 
hanging in the air until the new constitution is enacted. 
  What is this all about? The goal is to achieve a certain 
coordination in the functioning of various state executive 
organs in this area, and also to make their mutual measures 
coherent with one another, and to make them unanimous. We are 
aware that the president of the Polish Republic is the supreme 
state organ in these issues; in accordance with Article 34 of 
the Small Constitution he exercises general leadership in the 
area of the country's internal and external security. But it is 
not defined anywhere in what way he is supposed to exercise the 
aforementioned leadership. 
  In addition to that, the Law on the Popular Defense 
Obligation continues to include the definition of a National 
Defense Committee [KOK], which is a legacy from the previous 
[presumably communist] period. The Law says that KOK is the 
appropriate organ in issues of defense and security, and it is 
supposed to function in consultation with the Council of 
Ministers, but it is not known how that is supposed to come 
about in practice, nor is it known what KOK is supposed to be 
dealing with. Apart from that, the Small Constitution also 
provides a definition of a National Security Council [RBN] as 
the president's advisory organ in areas of defense and security, 
but it is not defined anywhere what the relationship is supposed 
to be between RBN and KOK, nor is it defined generally speaking 
what the relationship is supposed to be between the organs I 
just mentioned and the Council of Ministers. 
  [Swiac] But are you not afraid of disturbing a certain 
balance existing among the different authority components? 
  [Milewski] There is no such balance right now, and so one 
must simply achieve it, and that was the idea behind the 
proposal, which by the way was submitted jointly by the defense 
minister and the National Security Bureau [BBN] during the most 
recent KOK session. Let me remind you that KOK's composition 
includes the prime minister, four ministers--defense, internal 
affairs, foreign, and finance--as well as the chief of the 
General Staff, Sejm and Senate speakers, the minister of state 
from the Office of the President of the Republic of Poland, the 
president as the group's chairman, and myself as secretary. Now, 
the proposal was debated by the group of people I just 
described, and it was approved. The goal for us is to move for 
an amendment to the Small Constitution which would go in the 
direction of granting executive powers--and not just advisory 
ones--to RBN which will replace KOK which had existed up to now; 
KOK will be dissolved through appropriate amendments to the Law 
on the Popular Defense Obligation. We suggested the 
establishment of a permanent, interministry working group under 
the leadership of the defense minister who will be dealing with 
preparing all materials and issues discussed both by the Council 
of Ministers' Defense Issues Committee and by RBN. 
  Right now, there are different ad hoc committees within the 
government and in its close environment; there are also 
anticrisis committees and committees dealing with specific 
topics. Such committees are established, nobody knows how they 
function or when they are supposed to cease to function. By 
contrast, we would have [under the proposal] a permanent group 
established, with which, by the way, BBN would cooperate on a 
regular basis. 
  [Swiac] In your view, do these planned changes not conflict 
with the Partnership for Peace program which is based on the 
assumption of a democratic and civilian supervision over the 
Army? 
  [Milewski] The changes that we are proposing include a 
division of powers between a civilian defense minister and a 
chief of the General Staff who would be a military--he is the 
highest-ranking military in the Polish Republic. That division 
of powers does not exist right now since the Law on the Popular 
Defense Obligation which is currently in force, continues to be 
adapted to the old situation when the defense minister was at 
the same time the highest-ranking officer of the Polish Army 
since he was an active general or admiral. So we proposed these 
changes to have them implemented at the same time as dealing 
with issues of higher importance. The appropriate drafts of 
amendments were prepared and submitted to the Office of the 
Council of Ministers so that the Council of Ministers may debate 
them, and so that they may be later introduced in parliament on 
the government's motion, not on the president's. Such a decision 
was made at the most recent KOK session.

<F P=106> [Article by Lina Szejner: "To Have Your Cake and Eat It: </F>
Poles Want Wage Rises, but Fear Inflation"] 
  [Text] It is true that the World Bank gave top marks to 
our draft budget and assessed the Government's financial 
discipline in positive terms; nevertheless, experts versed in 
economic processes maintain that both the budget and the 
government could be threatened by an... 
<H5>  ...Inflationary Surge. </H5>
  The end of last year was quite disastrous in this respect. 
It was estimated that during just a few weeks in November and 
December the zloty [Z] lost 10 percent of its value. According 
to Finance Ministry figures, in December the average price level 
for consumer goods rose by 5 percent in relation to November. 
On the other hand, compared with the price levels in December 
1992, December 1993 prices rose by as much as 37 percent. This 
means that the predicted value of the inflation index (as 
estimated at the beginning of the year) was exceeded by almost 5 
points. 
  In December last year food prices climbed most sharply (by 
6.9 percent). In the same period alcohol prices rose by 6.3 
percent, the prices of nonfood goods rose by 2.5 percent, and 
services cost us 4.2 percent more. 
  Within the category of food products, the highest price 
hikes 
were recorded for potatoes, vegetables, fruit products, fats, 
pork, and dairy products. Overall, the average price rise for 
these foods amounted to 24 percent, and very few articles 
retained their earlier prices. 
  The rise in the costs of services was caused mainly by the 
introduction on 1 December of official increases in the cost of 
central heating and hot water (by approximately 15 percent), 
electricity (approximately 10 percent), and gas (approximately 5 
percent). 
  Overall, in the course of last year the price of services 
went up most sharply (by some 38 percent). Industrial goods 
came second (with an increase of about 37 percent), and consumer 
goods rated third (over 35 percent). The share of food products 
in the monthly expenditure of the statistically average family 
amounted to 40 percent. In this situation it might have proved 
difficult to maintain the level of food consumption were it not 
for the fact that... 
<H5>  ...Wages Climbed To Keep Up With Prices. </H5>
  According to the Central Office of Statistics [GUS], in 
December the average net pay in enterprises rose to Z4,312,000, 
which, compared with November figures, represented an increase 
of 15.6 percent. Compared with December 1992, on the whole 
wages in enterprises were higher by 34.4 percent (79.3 percent 
in the raw materials extraction industry, 18.9 percent in the 
construction industry, and 19.4 percent in local municipal 
economy). 
  According to information published in statistical reports, 
by 
the end of last year a marked acceleration in pay increases was 
noted in comparison with the previous year. In December 1992 
net pay in six basic sectors of the economy rose by 9.3 percent 
while at the same time consumption prices rose by 2.2 percent, 
whereas the corresponding increases in 1993 amounted to 14.2 
percent and 5.6 percent. If this trend continues in the current 
year, it will be impossible to keep the inflation increase 
within the estimated limit of 23 percent. 
  "How is it," people wonder as they read the statistical 
reports, "that official figures suggest that our wallets get 
fatter and fatter all the time, while in reality we still find 
it difficult to make ends meet?" Well, the drawback of the 
practice of "averaging" statistical figures is that it 
theoretically assigns even income increases to everyone, whereas 
the truth is that not everyone has benefited from pay increases 
to the same extent. Some groups (such as miners or power 
industry employees of the) got a lot, while other groups 
(employees of the clothing industry or the budget-funded sectors 
of the economy) got hardly anything at all, or even nothing at 
all. Nor did pay increases depend on the economic condition of 
individual enterprises or their productivity levels and their 
employees' qualifications. Moreover, statistics take no note of 
pay figures in the private sector, which is notorious for being 
most secretive about its pay levels. Nevertheless, various 
sources indicate that bosses in private firms and joint ventures 
pay lower wages. Within their own pay structure, they let their 
technical supervision personnel earn the highest wages, while 
paying the lowest amounts to manual workers. Therefore it would 
probably be highly accurate to assume that it was precisely that 
group of employees (in addition to those employed by the 
budget-funded sectors of the economy) who did not get any share 
in the "statistical" pay increases. Furthermore, this group 
also includes employees of firms which are currently in the 
state of decline. 
  Nevertheless, the vast majority of enterprise heads did 
decide, under pressure from trade unionists and their own 
employees, to increase their work forces' pay. Those "upward 
pay adjustments" were most often effected on account of the 
abolition of the "popiwek" tax [on above-normative company 
wages], although some enterprises actually went into debt as a 
result of the adjustments. 
  Expert analysts looking at our financial situation have come 
to the conclusion that inflation is the most ominous factor 
which could put an abrupt halt to our economic growth. In order 
to curb its progress, the government will most probably decide 
to introduce, instead of the popiwek tax, a different kind of 
sanction against excessive wage increases. 
  Experts suggest that in our present situation we should 
quickly increase inflation rates as soon as possible. However, 
the authorities are reluctant to authorize such a move because 
it would make things difficult for investors. 
  According to reports published by Social Research Center, 
Poles view the abrupt inflation increases with mounting anxiety. 
A certain proportion of respondents predict that the 
dollar-zloty exchange rate could now soar high above the already 
announced ratio of 1:26,300. At the same time almost 50 percent 
of those questioned are convinced that wages will rise as a 
result of the abolition of the popiwek tax. Some are even 
determined to ensure wage rises through strikes, if such a 
measure were needed. However, those are not at all the same 
groups which did not receive their share of pay increases last 
December.

<F P=106> [Statement by KOHA JONE's Editorial Board addressed to the </F>
International Federation of Journalists, Brussels; the Committee 
for the Defense of Journalists, Washington; the Balkan 
Confederation of Journalists, Thessaloniki; the International 
Federation for the Defense of Human Rights, Helsinki; the 
Council of Europe; the European Parliament; all diplomatic 
representations accredited to Albania; the editorial boards of 
newspapers, news agencies, and "our friends and colleagues in 
Europe and throughout the world," issued in Tirana on 31 
January: "The Arrest of Our Two Journalists -- A Serious 
Warning for the Albanian Political Climate and European 
Civilization"] 
  [Text] Dear Sirs, politicians, men of state, diplomats, 
deputies, and fellow-journalists, wherever you may be: 
  The Editorial Board of KOHA JONE, the largest independent 
daily newspaper in Albania, brings you ominous news: Yesterday 
morning, the Albanian state arrested Aleksander Frangaj, our 
newspaper's editor-in-chief, and Martin Leka, one of our 
best-known journalists. This development has deeply shocked us 
all. 
  The two journalists' arrests were made on a charge raised by 
one of the departments of the Albanian state. The current 
political establishment in Albania has subjected the independent 
newspaper KOHA JONE and its journalists to a continual 
inquisition. In 1993 alone, the State Control authorities 
conducted 30 inspections of the newspaper's finances, thus 
subjecting the newspaper and its readers to extreme tension and 
stress. Five journalists faced criminal charges or were under 
investigation by the prosecutor for all or part of this time; 
the newspaper's director and editor-in-chief were brought to 
court and sued by two ministers of the Albanian Government, but 
they emerged innocent; three of the newspaper's journalists have 
been prohibited by the state from moving freely among the 
country's cities, and are categorically prohibited from 
traveling abroad. Everybody in Albania has heard of and been 
touched by this disaster brought about by the state authorities, 
which have continually burdened the young, keen, and talented 
journalists who are determined to see KOHA JONE be part of a 
free press. The reason for the savage state attack against KOHA 
JONE is this: This newspaper and these journalists were the 
first in Albania, immediately after the start of democratic 
processes, to create a press free of political parties and the 
government. This newspaper has given the Albanian reader real 
information about what is happening (unfortunately, our country 
has seen major scandals, with corruption as far as the pinnacle 
of the state pyramid, implicating the masters of this pyramid 
themselves). This newspaper has never been scared by state 
repression, and has never become a servile and conformist rag at 
the behest of the government, the political establishment, and 
the party that wields total power in our country. 
  Our two colleagues were arrested today without being tried 
by 
the courts or the judiciary. Large cars full of policemen came 
for them with a deafening noise of alarm sirens and horns that 
told everybody that "we are settling accounts with the 
journalists." This savage police measure does not only affect, 
and is not only aimed against, these two colleagues of ours, who 
are now languishing in appalling prison cells, but threatens 
every journalist and every free citizen of our country. Mark 
well, friends and colleagues: At any time of the day or night, 
in the street, the office, a restaurant, or at home, fairly or 
unfairly, and without any court warrant, the police can come and 
take you to prison. This was the message learned by the free 
citizens of our country today as our two colleagues were 
arrested. This is the saddest message for the freedom of 
everybody. 
  It was the blind rage of the most spiteful section of our 
political state that arrested our two journalist colleagues 
today. They were charged by the Defense Ministry; immediately 
after this, the police, the state's other armed wing, arrested 
the journalists without waiting for warrants. Last year, it was 
this very same defense minister who placed criminal charges 
against our editor-in- chief, Aleksander Frangaj. He succeeded 
in unjustly imprisoning him for 35 days, but lost his case in 
court. He lost twice over, even though he twisted the charges 
in every direction. Another minister called Blerim Cela, 
chairman of the State Control Commission, also lost against our 
newspaper KOHA JONE, and returned from the court with 
discredited witnesses. It was spite over this that impelled the 
ministers and the most savage departments of the state to take 
revenge against the independent newspaper KOHA JONE. 
  The two journalists, our colleagues, were arrested today on 
a highly absurd charge. They have been accused over the same 
article published in the newspaper, but on different charges. 
While Editor-in-Chief Frangaj has been accused on a charge of 
publishing state secrets in a newspaper, the journalist Leka has 
been accused of slander and the publication of false 
information. Notice how our prosecuting authorities contradict 
themselves. It calls the same fact both a state secret and a 
lie. We have asked the state a thousand times to explain this 
absurdity, and now we ask you to ask whether a state secret is a 
lie or a lie is a state secret. The simple truth is as follows: 
A few days ago, the newspaper KOHA JONE published an original 
document signed by Defense Minister Safet Zhulali ordering 
officers to leave their weapons at their units when they go 
home, alongside a commentary by journalist Leka about this 
document. The document did not include anything secret, and the 
commentary merely commented on this document. 
  Our two colleagues were arrested today on the basis of the 
old Penal Code from Enver Hoxha's time, when freedom of 
expression and of the press was totally absent and agitation and 
propaganda were punished with life imprisonment. The fact that 
the charge is over a state secret suffices for us to judge. We 
do not know of any democratic regime in the world that would 
prosecute a journalist for publishing true facts and evidence 
that he succeeds in obtaining in the course of his work as a 
journalist. Even the Press Law recently approved by the 
Albanian parliament itself, although it shows no great love for 
a free press, does not dare forbid a journalist from obtaining 
and publishing a secret. Without even heeding its own Press 
Law, the Albanian police state reaches for the old laws of the 
disctatorship, and on the basis of these arrests our two 
colleagues. 
  Dear friends and colleagues, the arrest of our two 
journalists Aleksander Frangaj and Martin Leka poses a serious 
warning for the climate in our country and simultaneously for 
European civilization. The new democratic processes that began 
three years ago in Albania are now in great danger. The 
political pluralism that was achieved in our country is now 
seriously threatened. The freedom of the press and of speech 
that was gained is now under a fatal threat. The most ominous 
evidence of this is today's arrest of our two colleagues. The 
Albanian state imprisons journalists and, at the same time, 
leaves criminals and thieves who commit murders and acts of 
vandalism against people's freedom and lives to roam free. The 
supposed democratic appearance of the Albanian state is a mere 
facade and has no connection with the truth and reality of the 
Albania state today. In reality, this state is heading toward 
violence. On this occasion, we appeal to every personality in 
politics, diplomacy, the law, journalism, and in democratic 
philosophical life throughout Europe and the world, to carefully 
and realistically study the bitter truth of the threat to human 
freedom in Albania. 
  We appeal to you and, with great resolution and respect, 
call 
on you, all of you in whom we believe, to defend our freedom and 
the freedom of our two colleagues, to remove the handcuffs from 
their wrists and from the free Albanian press. 
  We ask you to use all your statesman-like, diplomatic, and 
professional skills to show genuine European and world 
civilization what is happening here. Help us, stand by us, and 
support us on our path toward achieving the necessary degree of 
freedom. We want our colleagues, who are free and innocent 
journalists, to be free among us, and ourselves to be free 
together with them.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Why Does Zhelev Keep Silent About Brigo's </F>
Warnings?"] 
  [Text] President Zhelev must immediately convene the state 
figures responsible for our national security. 
  Why are he and the deputies keeping silent when intelligence 
expert Brigo Asparukhov warned that the air strikes against 
Bosnia augur the greatest danger Bulgaria faced in the last 50 
years? Is it really a consolation that the Defense Ministry has 
a different opinion? 
  If the general is right our diplomats must oppose the 
bombings by any means, and not merely call upon the Balkan 
countries to refrain from interfering in the Yugoslav war. 
  We all know that Ankara is demanding a corridor through 
Bulgaria in order to make its strikes more powerful. One should 
not be concerned about whether, by some mistake, those doing the 
bombing or those being bombed also strike Bulgaria. 
  Such a danger always exists when air strikes are inflicted. 
However, this is the first time that one who should know about 
the plans of others warns publicly about the danger that exists. 
  If Zhelev believes the intelligence chief, who is his 
subordinate, then he must immediately assume his role as supreme 
commander in chief.

Cotroceni Palace this afternoon. The major part of the 
discussions was devoted to an exchange of opinions about the 
current situation in former Yugoslavia and to ways and means to 
overcome the Bosnian crisis, bearing in mind the recent NATO 
decision and ways to encourage the achievement of a peace 
accord, which is the priority at this stage, Presidency 
Spokesman Ambassador Traian Chebeleu told the media. 
  In this context, President Ion Iliescu greeted the first 
step 
toward the normalization of relations between Serbia and Croatia 
as an important element in seeking a peaceful solution on the 
territory of former Yugoslavia and expressed his readiness to 
support the peace process in general, both within the Geneva 
conference and through bilateral contacts with the other states 
created on the territory of former Yugoslavia. 
  During the talks, the two sides also discussed bilateral 
relations and the determination of the two states to develop 
them. The exchange of opinion between the two presidents will 
also continue during the official dinner that President Ion 
Iliescu is to give in honor of the Croatian President Franjo 
Tudjman.

<F P=106> [Article by Stevan Cordas: "Ultimatum -- An Introduction </F>
Into Aggression"; "pool" item] 
  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 10 (TANJUG) -- Without a clear and 
separate decision of the Security Council NATO air strikes on 
artillery positions around Sarajevo would constitute an 
aggression on Bosnia, which was recognised as a sovereign state 
by the very countries who are members of the alliance, 
diplomatic circles in Belgrade stated concerning the ultimatum 
endorsed by the North Atlantic Council in Brussels on Wednesday. 
  NATO threatened to use air power against Bosnian Serbs if 
they did not withdraw their heavy artillery to 20 kilometers 
from the center of Sarajevo within ten days. At the same time, 
NATO called for the Moslem heavy artillery to be placed under 
the control of the U.N. 
  The same circles quote Chapter Seven of the UN Charter which 
clearly states that actions, like those supported by the North 
Atlantic Council, could be undertaken only in the event of 
aggression of one state against another and if they jeopardize 
peace and security in the world. 
  Civil war is therefore not mentioned in this case and the 
international community has determined that the conflict that 
has been raging between the local Serbs, Croats and Moslems in 
the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina for almost 
two years is a civil war. 
  If the UN Charter was to be observed to the letter NATO 
could 
be declared an aggressor against whom the international 
community would have to take decisive actions because, according 
to numerous world analysts, the use of air strikes on positions 
around Sarajevo could jeopardize peace and international 
stability. 
  By taking these decisions NATO has not only addressed an 
ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs but has also shown its readiness 
for retaliation. The UN Charter, however, does not recognize 
retaliation as justified and describes it as aggression. 
  As far as the ultimatum is concerned, the Belgrade 
diplomatic 
circles consider that it is in fact a form of planned political 
pressure on the Bosnian Serbs ahead of the fresh round of peace 
talks due to start Thursday afternoon. 
  The NATO officials' interpretation of the three Security 
Council Resolutions 824, 836 and 844, which according to them 
provide sufficient legal foundations for action without Security 
Council approval, is not accepted in Belgrade. Belgrade points 
to the possibility of an arbitrary interpretation of these 
resolutions due to their generalized content. 
  At the same time Belgrade recalls the official positions of 
the two permanent members of the Security council, Russia and 
China, which are opposed to air strikes. 
  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin said in 
Moscow Thursday that the NATO ultimatum could not be accepted 
and said that it is not NATO's job to take such a decision, 
especially not about the use of force. 
  How NATO will act remains to be seen. 
  It is nevertheless clear that NATO has decided to adopt a 
high-risk policy which was confirmed by Boris Yeltsin's 
spokesman Anatoliy Kraskov who quoted the Russian president's 
warning in Moscow Wednesday that medicine should not be worse 
than the malady.

  [Excerpts] About five minutes ago, editor Agata Stanekova 
returned from Brussels. The Slovak Republic signed today, as 
the seventh state of the postcommunist countries of Central and 
East Europe, the Partnership for Peace [PFP] program at NATO 
headquarters in Brussels. It was signed by Prime Minister 
Vladimir Meciar. 
  Agata Stanekova asked Meciar what the significance of this 
document was: 
  [Begin recording] [Stanekova] Prime minister, the Slovak 
Republic officially confirmed by its signature today its joining 
the Partnership for Peace program. What does the partnership 
offer to Slovakia and vice versa? 
  [Meciar] The PFP offers certain guarantees. Above all, it is 
the condition of this partnership to accept human and citizens' 
rights, and, to prevent arguments about interpretation, when 
meeting Mr. Clinton, it was guaranteed that we understand them 
as individual rights. Another condition of the partnership is 
recognition of the current frontiers. This does not create any 
problems for us; on the contrary, we welcome it. 
  The PFP provides the opportunity for political 
consultations. 
The PFP provides the opportunity, in case of a feeling of 
threat, to carry out consultations with the other countries of 
NATO, although it does not bind NATO countries to military 
support or joint action. The PFP offers the chance to build the 
Army so that its organizational structure corresponds to the 
structure of the NATO Armed Forces. It provides the opportunity 
to participate in military planning, but also finance, and it 
provides the opportunity to set up joint units and joint 
training. 
  The Slovak side has expanded its offer of our arms industry 
because, sooner or later, the armies of NATO countries will 
unite their equipment, and we would like to take part in this 
process and to provide our production capacities. We have 
likewise offered to establish centers for the training of 
officers of the units, which will be common within NATO, in the 
Slovak Republic. Similarly, it will be possible to use training 
areas in our country. So, it is a process that has opened and 
has been prepared. We have stated our approach to the offer 
that we received, and, further, there will be talks at home 
about the treaty, which we should conclude and which will give 
rise to clear bilateral rules between Slovakia and NATO. 
  [Stanekova] The signing of this document was the first step. 
If this treaty was signed, what should be the basis for 
specifying further steps? 
  [Meciar] This was, in fact, an invitation to cooperation, 
which we accepted and signed. [passage omitted] For us it is 
important that a delegation of NATO high commissioners should 
come to our country soon. It has been promised by both Mr. 
Shalikashvili and U.S. representatives, and by the NATO 
secretary general. This delegation should have talks about the 
conditions of the treaty. After its conclusion, a bilateral 
treaty relationship will come into being. [passage omitted] 
The duration of this treaty will determine whether the country 
will be accepted as a member of NATO. The first step is behind 
us, and we have just started the second one. 
  [Stanekova] Despite all of this, some senior politicians, 
when speaking about new countries joining NATO, usually mention 
only Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic, leaving out 
Slovakia. 
  [Meciar] This has happened to some politicians. However, 
yesterday, for instance, I met German Defense Minister Volker 
Ruehe, who had also done this. We have clarified everything, 
and his immediate reaction was to invite the defense minister of 
the Slovak Republic to visit him, and he himself visited the 
Slovak Republic. Sometimes we have blown out of proportion 
something that has not always been done on purpose, taking it as 
a political precedent or a political intention--though this has 
never, in fact, been the case. I can say with pleasure that 
everything was clarified and that Slovakia is being fully 
accepted and fully relied upon. 
  Our geopolitical position clearly earns us such a position 
that we cannot be left out. Interest in the Slovak Republic is 
going to grow gradually. However, we have to take into account 
that the Federal Republic of Germany shares its borders with 
Poland and the Czech Republic, and their joint military 
exercises may take place there. Despite this, there is no 
reason to believe they are not interested in Slovakia. [passage 
omitted] [end recording]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article including statement by President Kiro </F>
Gligorov: "Impetus Toward Peace and Stability"] 
  [Text] Yesterday the United States and the Republic of 
Macedonia established full diplomatic relations. Yesterday 
afternoon the president of the Republic of Macedonia received 
the chief of the U.S. Liaison Office in Skopje, Robert Norman, 
who delivered the letter from U.S. President Bill Clinton 
informing him that the United States recognized the independence 
of the Republic of Macedonia and that full diplomatic relations 
were thereby established. The meeting was also attended by 
Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski. 
  Right after that, President Kiro Gligorov gave the following 
statement on the occasion of the establishment of diplomatic 
relations: 
  "This event is of exceptional importance for the Republic. 
With this act the United States has confirmed its principled 
stand and support for the independence and territorial integrity 
of the Republic of Macedonia, as well as our country's 
democratic orientation and the development of peaceful policy. 
It was done in the spirit of U.S. sponsorship for the admission 
of the Republic of Macedonia to the United Nations, of proven 
support for the inclusion of the Republic of Macedonia into 
international financial institutions and organizations, as well 
as the delivered humanitarian and technical aid to our country. 
  "U.S. recognition of the Republic of Macedonia represents a 
vital impetus for maintaining peace and stability in the south 
of the Balkans. The recent past has shown without a doubt that 
the independence and stability of the Republic of Macedonia 
represent the conditions for peace and stability in the region. 
  "On this occasion, I would particularly like to assert that 
the Republic of Macedonia will continue with its efforts for the 
creation of a climate of good-neighborliness, understanding, and 
stability in the region. We firmly believe that stopping the 
war on the territory of former Yugoslavia, instituting 
normalization of relations among the countries in the region, 
and opening a new era of full economic, cultural, and political 
cooperation in the Balkans are of singular importance. 
Good-neighborliness is of a vital interest to Macedonian 
foreign policy. 
  "Macedonia is ready to resume talks with Greece now, within 
the framework of the United Nations. We believe that we can 
reach an agreement on all open questions in our mutual relations 
as long as good will, preparedness for mutual understanding, 
respect of mutual interests for lasting good-neighborliness, and 
cooperation exist. Let me repeat, we are ready to view these 
questions with good will, in a constructive spirit, and with the 
required flexibility from both sides. Once again, I would like 
to reiterate that the Republic of Macedonia respects the 
territorial integrity and borders of the Republic of Greece, as 
well as those of neighboring countries. 
  "In accordance with the Constitution and its long-term 
defined policy of good-neighborliness and noninterference in the 
internal affairs of neighboring countries, we want to create 
conditions for mutual trust as an essential foundation for close 
and mutually profitable cooperation. 
  "Macedonia also remains open to all initiatives leading to 
peace, cooperation, and mutual trust in the Balkans. 
  "The establishment of diplomatic relations with the United 
States has been accepted with great warmth and support by the 
Macedonian public. It is an expression of the real feelings of 
friendship and the interest in general cooperation between our 
two countries and peoples."

chief of the general staff of the army of the Srpska republic, 
said today following his meeting with UNPROFOR [UN Protection

They have always lived in this area. We have no right to do 
such a thing and nothing can force us to leave our people at the 
mercy of fanatical Muslim units." 
  Mladic talked today to Generals Jean Cot and Michael Rose, 
UNPROFOR commanders for the former Yugoslavia and 
ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina. Vitaliy Churkin, Russia's deputy 
minister for foreign affairs, attended part of this meeting.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Ambassador to Poland Yuri Kashlev by </F>
Ryszard Malik; place and date not given: "Democratic Russia 
Does Not Pose a Threat to Poland"] 
  [Text] [Malik] Mr. Ambassador, has the "war of words," 
waged by our two countries for a few months now, ended yet or 
has it merely calmed down for a while? 
  [Kashlev] Now I will ask you a question: Has there been any 
"war of words"? There is a war when two sides shoot, when there 
are two enemies. In my opinion, it was merely artillery fire, 
and a shot by only one side at that. Our press has recently not 
published anything that would be leveled against Poland. 
However, Polish newspapers were abundant in remarks on the 
Russian bear, about the Kremlin's dictate... Our newspapers did 
not write about Poland in such an inhospitable manner. It is 
true that there were official statements on our part, as far as 
the issue of expanding NATO to include new member states was 
concerned; we took a stance on many issues related to the Polish 
efforts. Nevertheless, we understand that there is a difference 
between articles in mass media and the stance of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs [MSZ], the office of the president, or the 
government. 
  Ambassador Stanislaw Ciosek was summoned to our MSZ and he 
was informed about the anti-Russian overtones in the Polish mass 
media. That is all. 
  [Malik] However, was there any reason for such articles to 
appear in the Polish press? 
  [Kashlev] I know from where these articles came. Polish 
diplomacy fell into the trap of its own intentions which had not 
been thoroughly thought over. The reasoning behind that was 
probably something like this: within several weeks or months 
Poland will be admitted to NATO. I do not want to meddle with 
the internal affairs of Poland; I must, however, stress that in 
all my interviews with the Polish press I keep saying: this is 
impossible, this is not realistic for the time being. 
  [Malik] Why is it not realistic? 
  [Kashlev] At this moment at least. And it will not be 
possible very soon. This is because at the very beginning, after 
the release of information that Russia had withdrew its 
objection to Poland's joining NATO, which was during Boris 
Yeltsin's visit to Poland, the information was distorted. The 
intention of the Russian president, as well as the joint 
declaration that was then signed, was misunderstood. 
Incidentally, it was not really President Yeltsin, but General 
John Shalikashvili who said that we are not ready to shift the 
borders of NATO from the Oder to the Bug river. As it soon 
turned out, the West did not plan to admit Poland to NATO very 
soon, anyway. 
  [Malik] Why, then, did Polish, and not only Polish, 
journalists understand the Russian president in such a way? 
  [Kashlev] This is because none of the Polish papers 
published 
the full text of the declaration. It was clearly written: the 
stand of the Polish side was accepted with understanding. Both 
parties agree that, first of all, this concerns a certain amount 
of time; second, this will be done within the framework of 
building an all-European security system; third, that it will 
not conflict with the interests of the other party. I know this 
because I drafted the text myself. Now, everything that appeared 
later on in the press was shallow and simplified. In addition, 
at the press conference the president did not say what the 
newspapers later reported: Poles, you may enter NATO. Yeltsin 
said that the times when the Kremlin gave orders to Warsaw would 
not return. 
  [Malik] I heard what he said; I was there. 
  [Kashlev] Yes, there was also the statement that Poland is 
sovereign and that it can do whatever it likes. 
  [Malik] This means that we misunderstood the president? 
  [Kashlev] Reverting to the "war of words" in the recent 
months, there has not been such a war. For us, whatever is said 
by President Lech Walesa or Minister Andrzej Olechowski is more 
important than the articles of some journalists. The dispute was 
over the difference in understanding our stances. We understood 
it this way, you understood it differently. It was just 
bantering which did not in any way negatively affect our 
relations. 
  [Malik] Russia saw first of all its own interest, whereas 
Poland defended its own... 
  [Kashlev] Yes, this is exactly it. However, I believe that 
this, this difference of opinions, will have to be discussed and 
spoken about. For this reason, among others, Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev will soon visit Warsaw. 
  However, I must point to one thing that hurts me. There is a 
conviction, right or wrong, in Poland that this country belongs 
to the West. This is just like getting on a high horse, 
stressing that the border of Europe is at the Bug river. What 
about Russia? Does Russia not lie in Europe? Are Dostoyevski, 
Chaikovski, Chekhov, and Gercen not Europeans? Russia is in 
Europe and no one can change that. We do not want any 
separating, any new divisions. There must be one Europe. Now, 
you think that to be in NATO means to be in this "good" Europe 
and be against someone, against Russia? We emphasize that there 
must be one all-European security system that would comprise all 
the states. Such is our ideal for the future. 
  [Malik] Your ideal? 
  [Kashlev] Yes, this is an ideal, but it is difficult to 
implement. This will not happen very soon; however, the first 
steps have already been taken. I am now referring to the CSCE, 
the Council of North-Atlantic Cooperation, the European Union 
[EU], with which Poland has been associated since 1 February. 
Thus, there are already some mechanisms. We support these Polish 
efforts and we will watch this process with no ill feelings. We 
will do this thinking about our future and thinking that we will 
one day be in the EU as well. Now, as far as military 
cooperation is concerned, there is no such cooperation as yet. 
The 16 states that comprise NATO constitute a club of the rich, 
a club which remains closed to others. NATO was established when 
the Warsaw Pact was in place and it had a clear goal. Now that 
the pact has ceased to exist, the arrows on NATO's war maps are 
still directed in the same direction. NATO has not made an 
adequate transformation; the member states are still watching 
and waiting. The alliance, as a military pact, must have an 
enemy; it must be directed against someone. I am asking: against 
whom? 
  [Malik] That is right. Against whom, do you think? 
  [Kashlev] Ask Brussels about this; then you will understand 
our fears concerning the extension of NATO. The alliance is such 
as it is. In Warsaw they tell you this, and we are told that. 
Our concept is based on building a collective security system, 
comprising Russia and the former Soviet republics, on CSCE. We 
do not want a situation where some states are in NATO whereas 
others are outside of it. Thinking like the following: I will be 
in NATO and I do not care about anything else, I am safe and 
that means support for a divided Europe. Russia wants to go to 
Europe along with the Poles, Hungarians, Czechs, Bulgarians, and 
other nations. This is our concept. Now, saying: I am better, I 
will be first in NATO. What does this achieve, what does this 
achieve? 
  How many times has there been such a situation in history; 
even guarantees were given. We know how all this ended. 
  [Malik] Poland did not want any guarantees. As you know, 
recently there has been the concept of joint Russian-American 
guarantees... 
  [Kashlev] It was an attempt to respond to the suggestions 
made by the Visegrad Group, which wanted to fill the vacuum that 
had developed in Central-East Europe after all the changes. 
  [Malik] I understand the stand of the Russian Federation; 
however, you should understand the Polish stance, our fears. 
Poland has its own vision of security. Asked about their 
attitude toward their neighbors, Poles evaluate Russia as a 
hostile country... 
  [Kashlev] I know this and regret it. However, this should be 
laid at the door of the Polish press. 
  [Malik] The press? 
  [Kashlev] Exactly. It is some papers that create myths about 
various kinds of threats on the part of Russia, such as the 20 
million Russians who were supposed to roll through Poland. Who 
wrote about that and advertised it? Right now we are witnessing 
press hysteria with regard to Zhirinovskiy. Who is Zhirinovskiy? 
You have similar people as well. He is one of many politicians 
who say a lot, but who do not exert very much influence on our 
foreign policy. Why is so much written about him? 
  Believe me that today the democratic Russian does not pose 
any threat to Poland. 
  [Malik] Judging by the statements of Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
and Minister Pavel Grachev, Russia is not a state that would 
like to return to the role of a superpower which would want to 
shape the relations not only in its immediate surroundings. Are, 
then, people unnecessarily worried by the style and overtone of 
the statements of Russian politicians? 
  [Kashlev] Kozyrev has never spoken about the rebuilding of 
the Soviet Union in the old form or the Czarist Russia. He 
stressed, however, that there are many states around Russia 
where wars are being waged. There are borders on fire. Russian 
troops were often asked for help. They fulfill the role of a 
mediator. 
  [Malik] Did they fill this role when they supported the 
Abkhazians in the war with Georgia? 
  [Kashlev] The Russian troops did not back up any of the 
parties in this conflict. Both Eduard Shevardnadze and Vladislav 
Arjinba called us for help. 
  [Malik] Some wrote that Russia helped the present Georgian 
president defeat Zviad Gamsakhurdia, who was the democratically 
elected head of state. 
  [Kashlev] Has anyone found any evidence that would bear out 
such actions of the Russian troops? During the civil war, the 
Russians protected communication routes that are important from 
our point of view; that is all. Our troops settle conflicts by 
simply being there; they fulfill the role of peacekeeping 
[preceding word in English] units. What would have happened in 
Tajikistan, where the Muslim fundamentalists came onto the 
scene, had it not been for our soldiers? We must bear in mind 
that this country is inhabited by 300,000 Russians. The threat 
of Muslim fundamentalism also worries Uzbekistan and other 
Center Asian states. Therefore, cooperation is both in the 
interest of our country as well as these states. 
  [Malik] What about your troops in Armenia, Azerbaijan... 
  [Kashlev] We do not have any combat units there. They are 
fighting against each other. We want UN peacekeeping units to be 
sent there. Please remember that we must put out the fire on our 
southern borders. This is the only thing in which we are 
interested. We have no imperial ambitions. 
  [Malik] What is the role of Russia today? 
  [Kashlev] Russia is a large country. However, the most 
important task of the state and the government is to rebuild the 
economy. Unless we do this, the government will be obliterated 
from the face of the earth. The "Solidarity" demonstration in 
Warsaw stretched 5 km; ours will extend as many as 500 km. Can 
you imagine that? We would really like to deal only with the 
economy today; we are interested in developments abroad just as 
much as is necessary. We do not want the conflict in the 
Caucasus or Tajikistan to spread to us. In Russia there are 
millions of Tatars, Bashkirs, and people of other nations. We do 
not want to experience the Yugoslav conflict on our soil. These 
are the only things that we are worried about. Foreign policy is 
subordinated to our internal goals. 
  [Malik] However, Bill Clinton's America wants Russia as a 
superpower, does it not? 
  [Kashlev] Russia is a superpower; that is an objective fact. 
As far as our military potential is concerned, it equals the 
American potential; as for natural resources, Russia comes 
first. Russia is the largest country on earth. No one is going 
to take these advantages away from us. Washington has understood 
that it cannot take on everything. We are not a superpower 
because we are going through a crisis. However, we have a role 
to play. 
  Whoever forgets this and teases us, does the wrong thing. 
For 
example, the attempts of some of our neighbors to join NATO 
already today, shifting the borders of NATO--all this is playing 
into the hands of all the opponents of reforms, conservative 
forces, nationalists who are trying to block our reforms and 
impede our fight against the crisis. 
  [Malik] The role of Russia is appreciated today; however, 
Moscow's opinions on many issues are different. Will there not 
be a conflict with the West over the planned air strikes against 
Serbs in Bosnia? 
  [Kashlev] Russia's policy toward Yugoslavia is nothing new. 
Our view is different. All the wars, which in recent years 
resembled the Yugoslav conflict, such as the Afghan and Vietnam 
wars, were caused by the ignorance of politicians. They all 
started with small steps, with the intervention of units, and 
ended up in the tragedies of entire armies. One must know the 
history; one must know how to draw conclusions. If our generals 
had known about the defeats of the English in Afghanistan, they 
would never have gone there. If the Americans had paid proper 
attention to the experiences of the French in Vietnam, they 
would not have gone into the jungle. The Germans did not manage 
to cope with the Yugoslav guerrillas throughout all of World War 
II. Do you think that the West will cope with the Serbs today? 
Apart from that, bombs in Bosnia will be dropped on innocent 
people as well; the area is not the same as the hundreds of 
kilometers of desert in Kuwait or Iraq, where U.S. and French 
soldiers have recently fought. This is why Russia can see the 
danger of an armed intervention in Yugoslavia and fears that 
this local conflict may turn into a global one. One war has 
already started in Sarajevo. 
  [Malik] I understand that Russia has its own view on this 
issue. However, why is it so that, despite earlier enthusiasm 
for this concept, Russia is not hurrying to sign the 
"Partnership for Peace?" 
  [Kashlev] We will not have a race. We consider the 
"Partnership for Peace" to be the optimum solution today--for 
NATO, for you, and for us; it resolves the difficult problem of 
filling the vacuum left after the collapse of the communist 
system. Russia has good relations with the United States, also 
in the military area. In July, large-scale Russian-American 
military maneuvers will take place. Our military potential just 
cannot be compared to the military potential of the Central and 
East European states. We really have power at our disposal and 
this is why the scale of our cooperation with NATO, including 
cooperation in the military sphere, is different. If we want, we 
will sign the "Partnership for Peace" program; I emphasize, 
however, that we are not really in a hurry. Maybe we will settle 
for our relations with the United States and NATO which we 
already have and which are quite good. 
  Now, go and listen to Polish politicians. Some say that we 
are already prepared to join NATO; others laugh and say where 
the money for new equipment and modern communications systems 
for the Army should be taken from. For the time being, the 
Polish Army is dependent on deliveries from Russia and other 
states of the former Soviet Union. We are also buying some parts 
and components for our equipment in your country. This will last 
for quite some time. This is what I often emphasize in my talks 
with the Polish partners: Be realistic. Do you know how much 
money you will need to adjust to the military structures of NATO? 
  [Malik] From the point of view of not only Poland, Russian 
democracy is a great experiment. In the last elections, 
reformers were elected to the parliament; however, almost 
one-fourth of the voters supported Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who 
quite openly advertised the program of an imperial Russia. His 
statements, as well as the maps that he draws, upset a great 
many people. 
  [Kashlev] We cannot deny this fact. We realize this. 
Zhirinovskiy was supported by people who were taken in by his 
rhetoric. He attacked quite clearly and simply; he did not spare 
any sharp words. He condemned the condition of the economy, the 
crisis. He promised that he would help the poor and the patient. 
Other politicians did not say such things--they rather avoided 
any criticism. This is why Zhirinovskiy became popular. He won 
because he played on the people's emotions. Still, 25 percent of 
the people supported him, which is quite a lot. His victory 
showed the danger that Russia might find itself in if people 
such as himself come to power. I emphasize, however, that, 
fortunately, for the time being his words cannot be turned into 
action. Zhirinovskiy has no such possibilities or such powers. 
  [Malik] Thus, we can evaluate this situation objectively and 
say that Zhirinovskiy is playing into the hands of Yeltsin? 
  [Kashlev] You can say that, I suppose. It has gotten across 
to the world that Russia must be helped in overcoming the 
economic crisis. Then there will be no such people as 
Zhirinovskiy. However, do not forget that out of the sum of $40 
billion, we really received only a few billion... All the time I 
can hear the same old thing: Russia must be helped; however, 
these are only words, only blah, blah, blah. To ensure that 
Russia will overcome the crisis, this must be done efficiently. 
  [Malik] Reverting to the fears of Poles and Poland. Why do 
you think Russia is today perceived as our adversary? 
  [Kashlev] I understand Poles' fears. There was a time when 
Czarist Russia, along with Prussia and Austria-Hungary, caused 
the partition of Poland. Poland had really bad luck to have such 
neighbors as it had. Then, for over 40 years, the Soviet fist 
hung over the world. Again, you were unlucky to be closest to 
this fist. There were orders from Moscow. They say that there 
was also friendship between us. The Soviet Union was a 
militaristic state--its goal was to build communism around the 
world. Fortunately, there is no longer a Soviet Union, but a 
democratic Russia. I must say that over the last three years a 
breakthrough was made in our relations. I am now referring to 
our political contacts; economic relations are not so good at 
all. 
  [Malik] What do you think Polish-Russian relations should be 
like now that both states have found themselves on the road of 
reforms, when they are looking for their own niche in the new 
reality? 
  [Kashlev] Our old problems have fortunately been resolved. 
The Katyn issue has been explained; Russian troops are no longer 
stationed in your country; there is a treaty of cooperation 
signed by both presidents. We have as many as 35 agreements 
based on partnership. I am an optimist; however, all these 
agreements must be translated into the language of the practice 
of everyday life. Today is the age of pragmatists, not 
ideologists. That is good. 
  Our embassy has declared this year to be a year of economy 
in 
Polish-Russian relations. I advertise economics because I 
believe that a satiated man will not want conflict or war. He 
will not really feel like fighting. 
  I hope that many issues will be explained during the visit 
of 
our foreign affairs minister to Poland in late February.

  [Text] Tirana, February 7 (ATA) -- President of Albania 
Sali Berisha and President of Malta Censu Tabone held official 
talks on February 6 in which they expressed the common will to 
strengthen the friendly relations and to extent the cooperation 
in the economic field. 
  "The good political relations which exist between our two 
countries should proceed the cooperation in the other areas," 
President Berisha said, emphasizing that "Malta is one of the 
first countries which supported the democratic Albania, and we 
are thankful of you. But we already have ascended the period of 
short-term assistance and we would like Maltese business to have 
its commitment to Albania. We welcome this sort the Maltese 
investments operating now in Albania, in the Ksamil tourists 
zone and the oil extracting." 
  President Berisha asked also for Malta assistance in 
diplomacy, justice and medicine fields. 
  Concerning the situation in the region, Mr. Berisha repeated 
the Albania approach that "the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina is a 
consequence of Milosevic intentions to create by force the 
Greater Serbia. We urge," Berisha said, "that the lifting of 
embargo from Serbia should be connected with the solution of 
Kosova question." 
  President Tabone appreciated the actual Albanian leadership 
work in renewing the old Albanian nation and assured President 
Berisha that Malta Government is committed to promoting the 
cooperation between two countries. Mr. Tabone spoke of the 
interest of the Malta businessmen for Albania. 
  "Albania has the international support and it will receive 
the same support when Malta will become a full member of the 
European Union." 
  President Tabone invited President Berisha to pay a visit in 
return to Malta. President Berisha accepted the invitation with 
pleasure.

  [Text] Tirana, February 8 (ATA) -- "It is time to enter 
into a concrete road of the bilateral economic cooperation," the 
Albanian Premier Meksi said in a meeting he had early today with 
the Malta President Censu Tabone, reported the Press and 
Information Office of the Albanian premier. 
  Premier Meksi said that "our priority is tourism and the 
Albanian side is ready to sign agreements with the Maltese side, 
which is easier to be done now because the discussions for 
tourism agreements have already started," emphasized the 
Albanian premier. Both sides in the meeting said they were 
interested in the cooperation especially in the oil services, 
education and medicine fields. 
  President Tabone expressed the readiness of his country to

education and medicine sectors. "The tourism sector is an 
important incomes source in Malta," said President Tabone. "We 
are ready to cooperate with Albania in this field, giving our 
experience because the relief of our two countries is nearly the 
same." President Tabone said that he congratulates the speedy 
steps of Albania is making toward Europe. 
  Later on, Premier Meksi and President Tabone talked about 
the 
situation in the Balkan region, in former Yugoslavia, and 
Kosova. Mr. Meksi and Mr. Tabone expressed their common approach 
toward the crises in former Yugoslavia stressing their attitude 
toward a peaceful solution, the necessity of giving an end to 
the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as respect of the right of 
the Albanian people of Kosova for self-determination, which is 
based on the international documents and the CSCE principles.

  [Text] Tirana, February 8 (ATA) -- "Albania is for good 
relations with all democratic countries without prejudices they 
are small or big ones," Pjeter Arbnori, speaker of the Albanian 
parliament, said today in a meeting with the Malta President Mr. 
Censu Tabone. 
  Speaking about the Albanian foreign policy, Mr. Arbnori said 
"Albania is committed to have good relations with its 
neighbouring countries like Italy, Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, 
Slovenia, Romania, Croatia, and Macedonia. But we do not have 
good relations with Serbia because it is pursuing a genocidal, 
dictatorial and chauvinistic policy. 
  Concerning the Kosova question, Mr. Arbnori said that 
Albania 
is not for changing the borders by force, but we always will 
defend the rights of the Albanians who live there according to 
all the international charters. 
  "The changes brought about by the reform and the new 
improved 
law on foreign investments are a guarantee for all the foreign 
investors," speaker Arbnori pointed out. 
  President Tabone hailed the Albanian parliament for the work 
it has done in reforming the laws and establishing the 
democratic institutions which will advance Albania toward 
Europe. Considering the parliament as a living reflection of 
the democracy, Mr. Tabone expressed his pleasure for an 
interparliamentary cooperation between Albania and Malta. 
  The Maltese President Tabone said the Albanian approach 
toward Kosova question is very wise and that her right request 
can be solved in the context of the European Union.

  [Text] Tirana, February 8 (ATA) -- The second national 
conference of the Socialist Party (the former Party of Labour of 
Albania) began its proceedings yesterday afternoon with some 500 
delegates and guests. 
  The vice-chairman of the party, Mr. Servet Pellumbi said 
that 
the country is going over a political crisis and presented the 
alternative of the Socialist Party for the ruling of the country. 
  He presented once more the request of this party for 
premature elections in Autumn, this year. Although he admitted 
some of the economic achievements such as the creation of the 
legislation for the market economy, the creation of a new class 
of businessmen, stopping of inflation, Mr. Pellumbi accused the 
Democratic Party "for causing the tense political situation in 
the country, for non-allowance of different alternatives, and 
for violation of the human rights and freedoms," underlining the 
arrest of the leader of the Socialist Party, Mr. Fatos Nano. 
  The Socialist Party, stressed the report held in conference, 
asked for the approval of the constitution and for the 
functioning of the round table of the parties. 
  "The Socialist Party is for a unique national strategy and 
for a long-term plan in carrying out our national question," 
stressed the report. It asked the democratic state to give to 
the market social and human dimensions. 
  The Socialist Party declared itself against the 
privatization 
of some strategic sectors of the economy, against the taxes 
assessed on the farmers this year as well as against the 
dispersion of the agricultural enterprises. 
  Mr. Pellumbi appreciated the steps undertaken in order to 
pass the isolation of Albania and supported the development of 
the process of the international relations. He condemned the 
unprecedent violence of the Serbians in Bosnia and expressed his 
support for the Albanian brothers in Kosova, who are under the 
wild terror of Serbia. 
  Mr. Pellumbi expressed also in favour of the Albania's 
participation in the initiative "Partnership For Peace" and in 
favour of the strengthening of the friendly relations with 
neighbours and other countries in Europe and world. 
  A message of greetings sent by the chairman of the party, 
Mr. 
Fatos Nano, was read in the conference. Mr. Nano is in prison 
under the charge of abuse of duty and falsification of the 
official documents in 1991 when he was the premier of Albania.

  [Text] Tirana, February 9 (ATA) -- "The Socialist Party 
will have no more a commission of control and revision but it 
will have temporarily commissions which will put under control 
the financial operations of the party," settled the national 
conference of the Socialist Party in the second day of its 
proceedings, which lasted two days. A delegate from Elbasan, 
who did not agree with the dissolving of this commission, said 
that it's early to undertake such an action, but one of the 
leaders of the party, Mr. Gramoz Ruci argued that this is the 
opinion of specialists and the majority of the leading council 
of the Socialist Party. 
  The leading committee of the party will set up basic party 
organizations even abroad in accordance with the foreign laws. 
  The delegates who discussed in the conference supported the 
request of the Socialist Party for premature elections, for the 
functioning of the round table of the parties as well as for the 
release of the leader of the Socialist Party, Mr. Fatos Nano, 
who is in prison since July last year, accused for corruption in 
the case of the Italian aid granted to Albania during the time 
he was the premier of the country.

  [Text] Sofia, February 11 (BTA) -- National Assembly 
National Security Committee Chairman Nikolay Slatinski today 
sent a letter to President Zhelyu Zhelev, saying that the last 
few days have seen militant statements and decisions on the war 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Slatinski regrets that the institutions 
and officials directly involved in Bulgaria's foreign policy and 
national security have not shown the necessary coordination and 
have created an impression that there can be changes in this 
country's clear-cut and categorical policy. 
  Bulgaria is in favour of a peaceful settlement to the crisis 
and has repeatedly declared a firm resolution for 
non-intervention in any form in developments in former 
Yugoslavia. It has appealed to all countries in the region to 
respond in the same way, the letter stresses. Slatinski 
believes that in this critical situation there can be absolutely 
no change in the Bulgarian stand. In his capacity as National 
Security Committee chairman, he expresses a personal negative 
view of the possibility of air strikes and believes no sensible 
Bulgarian politician would support such action. 
  Slatinski asks the president to more decisively exercise his 
constitutional powers for the coordination and integration of 
efforts by political leaders, legislators and the executive to 
uphold the national position on the Yugo-crisis. 
  First Deputy Foreign Minister Valentin Gatsinski today 
briefed parliament's Foreign Policy Committee on the latest 
developments in former Yugoslavia and on Bulgaria's joining the 
Partnership for Peace Initiative. The committee decided to ask 
the President's Office to provide the text of the message by 
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel to President Zhelev to 
familiarize the committee members with it.

<F P=106> [From BTA press review] </F>
  [Text] Sofia, February 10 (BTA) -- "MP's say that 
according to number one spy Brigo Asparukhov the air strikes 
against Bosnia are the greatest threat to Bulgaria's national 
security in 50 years," the private 24 CHASA daily writes in an 
extensive front-page article. Mr. Asparukhov, head of the 
National Intelligence Service, reportedly said so at yesterday's 
meeting of the Parliamentary National Security Committee, which 
according to the parliamentary rules of procedures holds its 
sittings behind closed doors. 24 CHASA quotes the committee's 
chairman, Mr. Nikolay Slatinski, as saying: "If Turkey chooses 
to get involved in the conflict, it will not be allowed to use 
Bulgaria's territory." The daily reminds that on Monday 
President Zhelyu Zhelev received a letter from Turkey's 
President Demirel, asking him to back NATO's strike in Bosnia. 
"Until late last night the president had not given an answer," 
the daily reports. "Why does President Zhelev pass over Brigo 
Asparukhov's warning in silence?" the daily asks. In a signed 
commentary the private KONTINENT daily writes that Bulgaria's 
reaction must be swift and categorical, otherwise before long 
its foreign policy will be dictated by Ankara. Under the 
headline "Politicians Diverge on Yugo-Policy" the DUMA daily of 
the Bulgarian Socialist Party writes that the members of the 
Parliamentary National Security Committee were perplexed by the 
statement of Deputy Minister of Defence Boyko Noev that limited 
air strikes against Bosnia pose no immediate threat to 
Bulgaria's national security. 
  All papers frontpage reports on NATO's decision to give the 
Serbs a ten-day ultimatum to lift the siege of Sarajevo. "Thank 
God the World Overcame the Threat of Another Bloody conflict," 
reads a headline in the independent OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK. "NATO 
Decided To Strike Serbs in Bosnia," writes the trade-union daily 
TRUD. "The moment has come for us to say whose side we are 
going to take," the daily comments. "On the one hand, those who 
claim to defend democracy insist that we back the strike, 
threatening that otherwise we will be considered anti-democrats; 
on the other hand, brother Slavs warn us against such a step, 
describing it as a betrayal of kinship and 
good-neighbourliness," reads the commentary. "If we take the 
side of NATO, we shall be on the winner's side when the war 
ends. The question is, which war -- in Bosnia, Kosovo and 
Macedonia or in Bulgaria? For, when it comes to the crunch, the 
Serbs will hardly hesitate to blast the Balkans," writes TRUD. 
"And if we turn against NATO, we'll get a "hvala" 
[Serbo-Croatian for "thank you"], that is, a "spasibo" [Russian 
for "thank you"], but we will be reduced to pariahs in Europe 
for years on end," reads the commentary.

  [Text] Sofia, February 9 (BTA) -- There are no insoluble 
problems between Bulgaria and Albania, the chairmen of 
Bulgaria's Parliament Aleksandur Yordanov and of Albania's 
People's Assembly Pjeter Arbnori pointed out at their meeting 
here today. Mr. Arbnori is leading an Albanian parliamentary 
delegation which has arrived on a three-day visit here. 
  According to the Press Centre of the Bulgarian Parliament, 
Mr. Arbnori told Mr. Yordanov about the structure of the 
Albanian Parliament and its work. It is full of bitter 
political struggle, but it is much better to have it inside the 
parliament than out in the street, he reportedly said. Mr. 
Yordanov elaborated on Bulgaria's efforts to attract more 
foreign investment. He pointed out that the political forces in 
Bulgaria are unanimous in their attitude to the rights and 
freedoms issue and explained that both Christians and Muslims 
have their representatives in parliament and take part in 
lawmaking. 
  Mr. Arbnori expressed concern over the situation in the 
Balkans and the possible expansion of the conflict in former 
Yugoslavia to Kosovo and Macedonia. He pointed out that Albania 
is facing serious problems owing to the fact that only half of 
its population lives within the country's borders and the 
remaining part lives outside them. Mr. Yordanov said that the 
problems can only be solved on the basis of the assumption that 
there cannot be an ethnically clean state in the Balkans. He 
added that Bulgaria is willing to help maintain stability in 
this region. 
  The Albanian delegation met with representatives of the four 
parliamentary forces: the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), the 
Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), the Movement for Rights and 
Freedoms (DPS, representing the ethnic Turks), and the New Union 
for Democracy (NSD, consisting of former members of the 
parliamentary SDS), to discuss home policy issues. 
  The MP's discussed the developments of the past few years 
and 
the specifics of the transition period. Interesting coincidence 
was discovered in the ineptness of the shock therapy as a 
transition model, BSP deputy floor leader Aleksandur Marinov 
said after the meeting. "The Albanian delegation was interested 
in our stand on the land reform and particularly on the problem 
of production recovery, so that our country is not reduced to 
merely a market for imported goods," he explained. Another 
issue which is to be discussed in the European Parliament as 
well is the detention of Albanian Socialist Party leader Fatos 
Nano, who will probably be stripped of his parliamentary 
immunity. "We believe that such repressive acts, regardless of 
their motives, are harmful to the democratic process," Mr. 
Marinov pointed out. The Albanian delegation answered that the 
detention of Fatos Nano has nothing to do with political 
motives, as he is facing criminal charges. "We discussed the 
situation in the Balkans and shared the stand that all Balkan 
states should stick to the principle of non-intervention in the 
Yugo-conflict," Mr. Marinov added. "Naturally, we could not 
discuss the problem about Kosovo," he concluded. 
  SDS floor leader Stefan Savov told the Albanian delegation 
about the political realignment in Bulgaria's parliament and 
voiced his concern about the recommunization trends (passage of 
reform-blocking acts and political dismissals of SDS members), 
the Parliamentary Press Centre reported after the meeting. Mr. 
Savov suggested that the regional problems could be solved by 
erasing borders in the Balkans rather than by redrawing them. 
Mr. Arbnori approved of this stand but he pointed out that 
until that happens, Albania will protect the rights of Albanian 
minorities abroad. 
  Later today the Albanian delegation met with representatives 
of the parliamentary Movement for Rights and Freedoms. "We 
discussed the situation in the Balkans in the context of this 
region's role in Europe, the world and particularly Western 
Europe should stop regarding the Balkans as a powder keg," DPS 
deputy floor leader Yunal Lyutfi said after the meeting. It was 
pointed out that the Balkans should become a zone of peace and 
good-neighbourly relations. "In both countries the process of 
transition is remarkably peaceful, which is a guarantee for 
stability in the Balkans," Mr. Lyutfi explained. 
  "We discussed common problems concerning the legal framework 
of the democratic form of government and the problems of 
Albanians in former Yugoslavia," Professor Petur Markov said 
after the parliamentary New Union for Democracy met with the 
Albanian delegation.

  [Text] Sofia, February 10 (BTA) -- "The meetings we had 
here were very cordial and useful, we identified unanimity of 
opinion on the major issues raised during the discussions," 
Albanian People's Assembly Chairman Pjeter Arbnori told 
journalists after his meetings with Bulgarian statesmen and 
politicians. 
  Since its arrival here on February 8, the Albanian 
parliamentary delegation led by Mr. Arbnori met Bulgarian Deputy 
Foreign Minister Todor Churov, Bulgarian Patriarch Maksim and 
President Zhelyu Zhelev. Its meeting with Deputy Prime Minister 
Evgeni Matinchev initially scheduled for today was not held. 
The Albanian guests yesterday had talks with National Assembly 
Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov and representatives of the four 
parliamentary factions. The bilateral relations, the situation 
in the Balkans and the project for the construction of the 
east-west trunk road were high on the agenda of the meetings. 
  "The major thing is that there is not a single issue in the 
bilateral relations we cannot settle. We are in favour of peace 
in the Balkans, a just peace in agreement with the international 
principles for observation of human rights, we are in favour of 
promoting our economic, political and cultural contacts with 
Bulgaria and bringing our countries closer by means of the 
east-west trunk road that will link Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria 
and Turkey," Mr. Arbnori said after his meeting with President 
Zhelev. He also said that Albanian minister of transport and 
communications, as well as Albania's President Sali Berisha will 
visit Bulgaria some time soon. 
  Following a meeting at the Foreign Ministry, Deputy Foreign 
Minister Churov and Mr. Arbnori said that the two countries 
share identical views on the Yugo-war, based on support for a 
peaceful solution to the conflict and prevention of its 
spill-over. Voicing a serious concern over the condition of 
Albanians in Kosovo, the Albanian People's Assembly chairman 
underscored the need for observation of their human rights. Mr. 
Churov said that the Bulgarian side has expressed its principled 
stand on the observation of human rights and the status of 
Kosovo and has stressed that Kosovo should be prevented from 
turning into a bridge between the conflict already existing and 
a large-scale Balkan war. 
  The Bulgarian side reiterated the stance it has adopted at 
the very outbreak of the conflict: This country is against the 
setting up of ethnically-based states, the transgressing of 
existing borders and forcible territorial gains, Mr. Churov 
said. He went on to say that, on the other hand, Bulgaria is 
ready to accept decisions taken by the sovereign will of the 
countries immediately involved in the conflict. 
  Commenting on his failed meeting with the deputy prime 
minister, Mr. Arbnori explained with understanding that Mr. 
Matinchev has been urgently summoned in parliament to attend a 
closed-door sitting on the 1994 security and defence budget bill. 
  The Albanian guests met Bulgarian Patriarch Maksim at their 
request. Speaking on the national radio, Bishop Neofit of 
Lefkia quoted Mr. Arbnori as saying at the meeting that the 
Albanian Orthodox Church seeks to maintain good contacts with 
the Bulgarian Orthodox Church and is supportive of extending 
grants to Albanian students to study at Bulgarian theological 
schools. Patriarch Maksim is reported as expressing a hope that 
the relations between the two Orthodox Churches will be further 
promoted in the future. 
  Tomorrow the Albanian delegation will visit cultural and 
historical sites in the countryside.

  [Text] Sofia, February 9 (BTA) -- "The first visit to 
Bulgaria by the minister of education and culture of the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia, Prof. Dr. Slavko Gordic, aims to study 
the possibilities of cooperation between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia 
in science and education," Marko Todorov, Bulgaria's minister of 
science and education, said after his first meeting with Prof. 
Gordic today. He laid particular stress on the issue of the 
Bulgarian minority in Yugoslavia and the necessity to resolve 
the problem of teachers and textbooks of the Bulgarian language 
and literature, history and geography for the Bulgarians living 
in the Western Outlands (given to Serbia under the Treaty of 
Neuilly of 1919). The exchange of lecturers and students 
between the universities of the two countries was also 
discussed. The guests showed interest in establishing contacts 
with the universities in Sofia and Veliko Turnovo and the 
Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. 
  Prof. Gordic told reporters that his talks with the 
Bulgarian 
minister of science and education passed in an atmosphere of 
understanding setting a basis for the promotion of relations to 
the interest of both countries.

  [Text] Sofia, February 9 (BTA) -- The Confederation of the 
Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria (KNSB) leaves the National 
Council for Tripartite Cooperation (comprising the government, 
the trade unions and the employers) until parliament passes the 
1994 budget and the parliamentary forces take a stand on the 
KNSB-sponsored measures accompanying the budget, KNSB leader 
Prof. Krustyu Petkov told a briefing today. An address of the 
KNSB Executive Committee to the parliamentary factions says that 
the passage of the 1994 budget in its present form would place 
the socially weak strata in an extremely difficult situation and 
would result in unwarranted cuts in social expenditures. 
  The independent trade unions insist that parliament urgently 
pass acts to regulate the social funds and provide moderate 
protection for Bulgarian industrial and agricultural production. 
The KNSB is for revising the unreasonably high taxes and fees 
payable by private entrepreneurs and leaseholders, the document 
reads. This trade union amalgamation wants the cabinet to set 
up a 500 million leva (about U.S.$12 million) fund for extending 
credits at moderately preferential terms to managers and workers 
to facilitate their participation in privatization. The KNSB 
also demands the passing of an act restituting the property of 
juristic persons the economic activity of whom was terminated by 
the communist regime after September 9, 1944. 
  The KNSB has moved in parliament a package of proposals and 
projects comprising fundamental principles of bills regulating 
the setting up and management of a special "social assistance" 
fund and the election of representatives of the insured in the 
management of different social funds. A declaration of the 
executive committee of the confederation regarding the property 
of the former trade unions by the end of 1993 proposes that this 
property be used in setting up a fund for the social assistance 
of the poorest strata of the population, controlled jointly by 
state and public organizations. Over 2.5 billion leva (about 
U.S.$75 million), the sum at which the KNSB estimates the 
property of the former trade unions, are actually frozen, a 
letter of the KNSB to the National Assembly reads. By the end 
of the week this trade union amalgamation intends to hold 
meetings with representatives of the parliamentary political 
forces, Prof. Krustyu Petkov said at the briefing. The meetings 
will discuss issues related to the draft budget and the funds 
allocated to education, health care and the municipalities in 
this country, the trade union leader added.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 10 (CTK) -- Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus 
said today the government and the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), 
of which Klaus is chairman, believe the civil war in Bosnia 
should not be resolved by external intervention but by internal 
settlement. 
  In his personal view the air strikes which the NATO Council 
threatened Bosnian Serbs with unless they withdraw heavy 
artillery from surrounding Sarajevo are "unfair". "Personally I 
see it as a little unfair to say: Ground troops no but from the 
air yes. That seems too easy to me and I don't know if it is 
fair," Klaus said. 
  Given the non-existence of a front and the unclear positions 
of the armies, the government considers external intervention 
could lead to "far greater massacres and catastrophes," Klaus 
said. 
  On Wednesday [9 February] the NATO Council gave the Bosnian 
Serbs 10 days from February 10 to withdraw all heavy artillery 
including tanks and mortars to a distance of 20 km from the 
center of the besieged Bosnian city of Sarajevo and deliver them 
into the control of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] troops, NATO 
will conduct air strikes against their positions.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 10 (CTK) -- The Left Bloc Party (SLB) 
is opposed to a direct attack by NATO air forces in Bosnia and 
is calling for the withdrawal of the Czech UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] unit from the former Yugoslavia, SLB 
Chairwoman Marie Stiborova told journalists today. The conflict 
can be solved only by negotiations, she stressed. 
  Stiborova pointed to the possible escalation of the conflict 
which would endanger civilians and UNPROFOR forces, including 
the Czech units operating in the area. She said she believed 
that the security of the Czech Republic would be jeopardized as 
well, due to its "being involved in the War conflict." The SLB 
was opposed to the strengthening of the Czech military unit in 
the region in 1993, and now it urges its withdrawal, she stated. 
  The conflict could be solved by immediately convoking a 
peace 
conference attended by representatives of the former Yugoslav 
lands, representatives of international institutions and top 
European politicians, Stiborova said. 
  The SLB thinks that world politicians who should have 
efficiently intervened in the talks between the antagonists in 
Bosnia have so far taken part in them only as observers, she 
added.

will not comment on statements by the chairman of Russia's 
Liberal Democratic Party, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, attacking Czech 
President Vaclav Havel, Halka Hritzova, the office spokeswoman, 
told CTK today. 
  On Tuesday [8 February], Zhirinovskiy told Czech Television: 
"If Vaclav Havel is not pleased by my possible visit (of the 
Czech Republic), then I'm also not pleased that a playwright can 
become a president. It's not right." Zhirinovskiy said this 
after he had confirmed that he had received an invitation to 
visit the Czech Republic from the Assembly for the 
Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC). 
  Zhirinovskiy also predicted that in ten years there would be 
no more Moravia or Sudetenland. "In ten years the entire Czech 
nation will be cursing Havel, just like the Russian people are 
cursing Gorbachev," he said. "Vaclav Havel will die and in ten 
years young Czechs will be cursing him. (Because the Germans) 
will force them to speak German, they will force them to forget 
their mother tongue, they will force them to go to German 
churches and clean the boots of German officers." 
  In his regular Sunday radio speech, Havel said: "Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy holds a diplomatic passport and he therefore can 
come to the Czech Republic anyway. Then it will be up to him 
what he will say here and whether or not our authorities will 
consider it appropriate to expel him eventually.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 9 (CTK) -- The Czech Government is 
opposed to the creation of a special law on ethnic minorities or 
of an institution to deal with related questions, Prime Minister 
Vaclav Klaus said today. 
  The government reached the conclusion after studying 
material 
on ethnic minorities submitted to it by Minister Igor Nemec, 
chairman of the Government Ethnic Minorities Council, Klaus 
said. He stressed that the government unequivocally supported 
"a policy of ethnic minorities' non-discrimination." 
  According to the 1991 census, the Czech Republic had 10.3 
million citizens. The strongest ethnic minorities were Slovaks 
(314,877), Poles (59,383), and Germans (48,566).

  [Text] Budapest, 11 Feb (MTI) -- "If this is the NATO that 
Hungary strives so hard to become a member of, then we can rest 
assured: Perhaps the common conscience of societies is still 
alive," writes an article in the Friday issue of the national 
daily MAGYAR HIRLAP, commenting on the NATO ultimatum to the 
Serbs. 
  "No one is overjoyed that the situation has gone this far. 
The aim of the ultimatum is to force a withdrawal, rather than 
to implement air strikes. It is regrettable that the latest 
manoeuvres of Russian policy weaken precisely the power of 
threat, and in a manner that almost encourages the Serbs to hold 
on to their positions," writes the daily. 
  According to NEPSZABADSAG, the ultimatum clearly foreshadows 
an increase in the arbitrating, or policing, role of NATO. The 
daily terms it noteworthy that "the United Nations is preparing 
to strike with NATO's fist for the first time ever." 
  "The elimination of the U.N. Security Council, that is 
Moscow 
and Beijing, from such a major decision is the first sign in the 
reorganization of the world's power positions. 
  "At the end of ten days, when the ultimatum expires, or 
perhaps even sooner, the world will know whether Russia is as 
weak as to have the affairs of the world settled without it, or 
in spite of it," the daily writes. 
  According to UJ MAGYARORSZAG, after the cautious approach of 
the long months and years, the Brussels decision came almost as 
a surprise. However, it was at least as late as it was 
surprising, the daily notes, for Karadzic and his allies have 
almost fully achieved their goals by now, thanks to the delaying 
conduct shown by the West. 
  As regards the Russian protest, the daily notes: "Inasmuch 
as 
the air strikes do begin, then something could possibly be 
achieved in Bosnia, however, it would lead to a dangerous break 
between Russia and the West."

  [Text] Budapest, 10 Feb (MTI) -- No media law seems 
imminent, and temporary regulation of the media for the election 
campaign is also uncertain, parliament's Cultural Committee 
concludes. 
  The opposition Hungarian Socialist Party (HSP) collected 
50,000 authenticated signatures for parliament to include a 
media bill in its agenda. Meanwhile, the government has also 
submitted its media bill draft, to be discussed by Parliament in 
the near future. 
  HSP's Ferenc Kosa wants Hungary to have a media law before 
the election campaign. If not, supervisory committees could be 
set up to ensure ethical campaigning on radio and television, he 
presumed. 
  Miklos Haraszti of the main opposition party, the Alliance 
of 
Free Democrats (AFD), noted that the government had a new 
version of the media law differing from the original consensus 
at several points. As the bill can only pass if supported by 
two-thirds of deputies, he felt preliminary consultations were 
inevitable. 
  Attila Zsigmond of the ruling Hungarian Democratic Forum 
said 
the HDF was ready for discussions, but he was not authorised to 
announce this officially.

  [Text] Warsaw, Feb. 9 -- Although the ruling coalition of 
the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) and the Polish Peasant Party 
(PSL) has survived its immediate crisis, the fundamental dispute 
between them is still unresolved and could re-emerge in a short 
time, many leading opposition politicians were agreed on 
Wednesday. 
  Tadeusz Syryjczyk, a council member of the Democratic Union 
(UD), the largest opposition party, said that the crisis had 
shown the ruling coalition, whose members have roots in the 
pre-1989 communist system, did not have "experts on governing 
under democratic conditions." 
  Donald Tusk, leader of the Liberal-Democratic Congress (KLD) 
- which is making plans to merge with the UD - said that the 
real problem facing Poland was not the issue of personalities in 
the coalition, but the statements and decisions of the Pawlak 
government. Tusk argued that many decisions, particularly 
relating to the budget and to taxation of small companies, 
threatened to undermine the reform achievements of the past four 
years. 
  Leszek Moczulski, leader of the rightist Confederation for 
an 
Independent Poland (KPN), said that none of the fundamental 
issues had been resolved in relation to privatisation and the 
dispute over the Finance Ministry. He predicted that the next 
coalition crisis would erupt in four weeks time. 
  Jerzy Eysmont of the Non-party Reform Bloc (BBWR) noted that 
despite the coalition agreement, there were sharp differences 
between the SLD and the PSL over the state finances, the budget, 
privatisation and local government reform. 
  For the leftist Union of Labour (UP), parliamentary floor 
group spokesman Tomasz Nalecz said that the crisis was the 
"first serious warning signal" over the differences between the 
coalition partners. However, he added that "parliamentary 
arithmetic" saved the coalition, since there is no obvious 
alternative. However, "apart from the elegant style of 
Borowski's departure from the cabinet, nothing was prevented. 
(...) It was a serious coalition crisis, and more crises will 
follow," he predicted. 
  Nalecz dismissed as "difficult to imagine" the suggestion 
from KPN Leader Leszek Moczulski of a possible coalition of the 
KPN, the PSL and the UP. 
  Among extra-parliamentary rightist groupings, opinions were 
divided, but most were agreed the coalition was unlikely to 
survive the full parliamentary four-year term. Pawel Laczkowski 
of the Party of Christian Democrats (PCHD) said that he believed 
the present coalition would easily see out the year. However, 
there had been a clear shift in the relative balance of power, 
with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak strengthening his position. 
  Romuald Szeremietiew, leader of the Movement for the 
Republic 
of Poland (RDR), described the coalition as a marriage of 
convenience which was likely to face ever more rocks in its 
path. Ludwik Dorn of the Centre Alliance (PC) believed that the 
position of the SLD and its leader Aleksander Kwasniewski had 
been weakened. 
  Janusz-Korwin Mikke of the Real Politics Union (UPR) said 
that there seemed to be no real alternative to the present 
coalition. Part of the SLD would like to make an alliance with 
the Democratic Union (UD), but the UD is opposed. Also, there 
is the possibility that SLD deputies from the All-Poland 
Alliance of Trade Unions (OPZZ) might seek to make a separate 
coalition deal with the Polish Peasant Party, but at the moment, 
OPZZ deputies are apparently not ready to break up the SLD. 
  Poland's international partners are unwilling for the moment 
to comment on developments in the ruling coalition. Officials 
at the World Bank in Washington, who requested anonymity, said 
that the bank was prepared to work with anyone appointed to 
succeed Marek Borowski as finance minister. It was also 
stressed that no official position could be expected from the 
World Bank as long as the situation in Poland remained unclear, 
and that the bank was concerned at the possibility of amendments 
to the draft budget. 
  The value of Poland's sovereign debt on world secondary 
markets, which after Borowski's resignation had fallen from 50.5 
cents to the dollar to 46.5 cents, on Wednesday seemed to have 
stabilised at 47 cents.

  [Text] Warsaw, 9 Feb -- In the view of Donald Tusk, the 
leader of the Liberal Democratic Congress [KLD], the essence of 
the problem in Poland is not personal skirmishes between members 
of the coalition but those announcements and decisions of the 
Pawlak government that clearly undermine the reforming 
achievements of the last few years. 
  In a statement issued after the Wednesday meeting of the 
National Board of the KLD, the suspension of the self-government 
reform of the state, an increase in inflation over the last 
quarter of last year caused, in the KLD's view, by budget 
expenditures directed more at social welfare protection than 
active forms of counteraction of unemployment, and also the 
slowing-down of privatization, were listed as being among the 
threats to the long-term policies of the economic development of 
Poland. 
  The congress also inter alia listed the introduction of 
lump-sum taxation for small firms, and which constitutes a real 
threat to their existence, as being among the unfavorable 
decisions [of the government]. 
  In the statement, it is stressed that in a situation where 
the Suchocka government was -- thanks to budget discipline -- 
able to decrease the budget deficit in 1993 by over 20 trillion 
zlotys, "it ought to be realistic to take decisions reducing the 
tax burden and stimulating enterprise, and not wasting money 
through unrealistic and uncontrolled welfare expenditures and 
also the massive arousal of social expectations." 
  Speaking on the subject of the Wednesday demonstration by 
Solidarity, Tusk stated that in a situation where the trade 
union right is demanding the implementation of ever greater 
workers' demands, and the government is capable of giving way 
before these expectations, in accordance with that which it 
promised in the election campaign, all the more significant is 
the voice of "the milieux that are today weak, so that the logic 
of the economic reform be defended." 
  As Tusk told journalists, the congress is pleased with the 
fact that, in accordance with the Tuesday assurances of 
Democratic Union [UD] activists, the statement by Mazowiecki 
from a few months ago remains applicable, that the idea of the 
creation of a new party from the milieux of the UD and KLD is 
conceived as an alternative relative to the Polish Peasant Party 
[PSL] and Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]. UD activists have 
assured the congress that there are not and will not be any 
talks on the subject of possible closer cooperation with the SLD 
until the time of the April Unification Congress of the two 
parties, Tusk added.

  [Text] Warsaw, Feb. 9 -- According to head of the Party of 
Christian Democrats (PCHD) Pawel Laczkowski, the coalition of 
the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) and the Polish Peasant Party 
(PSL) is rather durable. Laczkowski said on Wednesday he did 
not expect the coalition to break up soon, although he was not 
sure whether it could survive four years. 
  He explained that by relative durability he meant the 
ability 
to adopt budget and to cope with local government elections. He 
did not expect any crack to take place this year as too many 
parties were waiting as alternative candidates, for instance, 
the Confederation for an Independent Poland (KPN). 
  The PCHD leader believes that internal shifting took place 
in 
the coalition and that Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak emerged 
strengthened from the dispute. He would get even stronger if 
Henryk Chmielak (first deputy finance minister) were appointed 
as finance minister. 
  Laczkowski added that another major crack, for instance over 
the agrarian policy, could take place, but he did not see major 
threats to the coalition's relative durability.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 10/2/1994 -- "The meeting's main 
purpose was to analyze the way how the countries in the region 
could assist in the implementation of the European Union's peace 
plan," said Romania Foreign Affairs Minister Teodor Melescanu on 
his return from Geneva, where he attended an informal meeting of 
the co-presidents of the international conference on former 
Yugoslavia with the foreign ministers of the countries 
neighboring ex-Yugoslavia and of Greece, in its capacity as 
current president of the European Union. 
  Teodor Melescanu said that the future of the economic 
cooperation in the area after the extinction of the conflict, 
the embargo consequences incurred by the economies of the 
neighboring countries, as well as the possibility of retrieving 
the losses were further themes of major interest discussed 
during the meeting. 
  "Also, it was accepted for the first time now that a 
political-military equilibrium should be achieved in the area. 
And I believe that even the fact that the necessity was 
mentioned of continuing such contacts among the neighboring 
countries, including at a higher level, is a recognition of 
Romania's idea as to the contribution of the countries in the 
area to seeking a solution for the peaceful extinction of the 
conflict," Teodor Melescanu added. 
  Referring to the latest decisions of the North Atlantic 
Alliance, the Romanian foreign minister said that "the only 
problem now is to find concrete possibilities for the withdrawal 
and especially of monitoring its observance. I am afraid there 
is the danger in this period of all kind of attempts to cause 
incidents, so I believe a very serious involvement of the UN 
forces will be vital."

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 9/2/1994 -- "Any use of force 
can bring only new tragedies, more lives lost," said Foreign 
Ministry Assistant Spokesperson Simona Miculescu in a press 
conference on Wednesday [9 February], while elaborating on the 
Geneva informal meeting of the co-presidents of the 
international conference on former Yugoslavia, with the foreign 
ministers of the countries neighboring former Yugoslavia, the 
foreign minister of Turkey and the representative of the 
European Union Presidency. 
  Romania considers that a political solution is the only one 
capable of settling the conflict in former Yugoslavia, said the 
spokeswoman and underlined: "One of the assumptions Romania has 
taken into account when stating its position with regard to the 
situation in former Yugoslavia was the important role that could 
be played in a peaceful settlement of the conflict by the 
countries neighboring former Yugoslavia." 
  The Geneva meeting could be considered a direct and concrete 
result of the two international mediators' talks in Bucharest, 
the spokeswoman said. 
  Secretary of State of the Romanian Foreign Ministry Adrian 
Dohotaru, currently visiting the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, 
met with the federal minister of minorities and human rights and 
federal culture minister, with the deputy minister of foreign 
affairs of Yugoslavia and with the minister of culture and 
relations with diaspora of Serbia. The visit is an expression 
of the Romanian Foreign Ministry's preoccupation of maintaining 
a continuous dialogue with the Romanian nationals living in 
Yugoslavia and of finding, together with the Yugoslav 
authorities, the means of full expression of their ethnic, 
language, cultural and spiritual identity, said Romanian Foreign 
Ministry's Assistant Spokesperson Simona Miculescu. 
  A Romanian delegation will attend a meeting on February 11, 
in Athens, of representatives of the European Union, the six 
states associated to the European Union and the Baltic states, 
to discuss a draft pact of stability in Europe. Romania will 
reiterate its support for a pact ensuring stability in Europe 
through the promotion of good-neighborly relations among states, 
will underscore the precedence of the European Union's support 
to the reform and democratization processes in Central and 
Eastern European states, will promote the principle of frontier 
inviolability, will reassert Romania's readiness to entrench the 
European standards in the field of the rights of the persons 
belonging to ethnic minorities, the spokeswoman said. 
  Referring to the consultations that are taking place on 
February 9 and 10 between experts of the Foreign Ministries of 
Romania and the Czech Republic, the spokeswoman said they were 
working on the updating of the bilateral relations through an 
intergovernmental protocol to discern which of the conventions 
agreed by Romania and former Czechoslovakia until 1992 are still 
effective and which are not. 
  Talks are scheduled to take place today, February 9, in 
Bern, 
between secretaries of state of the Foreign Ministries of 
Romania and Switzerland, approaching issues of the 
Romanian-Swiss relations and seeking to find out joint actions 
aiming to develop these relations. 
  The Romanian Foreign Ministry Secretary of State Gheorghe 
Tinca will have consultations by mid-February at the Foreign 
Affairs Ministries of Pakistan, Japan and the People's Republic 
of China. The state secretary's visit in Pakistan is going to be 
the first at such level after 1989. State Secretary Tinca will 
convey a message from Romanian Premier Nicolae Vacaroiu to 
Pakistan's Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. The talks the 
secretary will have in Japan represent a continuation of the 
ones in Bucharest, in 1992. The consultations in the People's 
Republic of China follow the protocol signed earlier this year 
referring to the collaboration between the two ministries. 
During his three-state tour, Gheorghe Tinca will approach also 
international issues of mutual interest and will promote some 
actions meant to evince the economic potential of Romania.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES 9/2/1994 -- Reform in the Armed 
Forces and matters related to the Partnership for Peace were 
touched by National Defence Minister Lieutenant-General Nicolae 
Spiroiu in the news conference given in Bucharest, on 9 February. 
  He assessed the Armed Forces' activity in 1993 as 
satisfactory, saying that a package of bills required for the 
Armed Forces' reform had been advanced to the parliament last 
year, and it would be extended with a bill of the status of 
draftees and of military hired on contract. The integrated 
strategy of national security and the national military doctrine 
were articulated, documents which were being currently adjusted 
in order to have them harmonized with the mechanisms of the 
Partnership for Peace, General Spiroiu said. The new leading 
structures of the Army were endorsed by the Higher Defence 
Council and became effective on November 1, 1993. The staffs 
and general staff were established, the military education is 
being restructured and so are the defence industry and logistic 
sector, to keep up with the current requirements, the defence 
minister said. 
  Referring to the Partnership for Peace, the defence minister 
said the signing of the master document, although expressing 
Romania's will, did not generate any advantage in point of the 
Partnership for Peace. But it was a clear proof that "we have 
chosen the rapprochement with the North-Atlantic Alliance, and, 
after more stages are covered, the program is expected to be 
rounded off with another program of joint activities, followed 
by concrete links with the Joint Command of Europe and the NATO 
Headquarters in Brussels. 
  As regarded the Romanian Armed Forces' relations with 
Russia, 
the defence minister said that serious reasons caused the 
postponement of the visit by the defence minister of the Russian 
Federation, which was not "an evidence" of cooling military 
relations with Russia. 
  General Spiroiu also announced he would visit Spain in early 
March, when he would also sign a bilateral military agreement as 
part of the Romanian strategy of expansion of the relations with 
the Armed Forces of the North-Atlantic Alliance.

  [Text] Bratislava, Feb 10 (CTK) -- You have to look at the 
ways, methods and means of the Slovak Government to find the 
reasons why the government and Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar 
have been questioned, Slovak President Michal Kovac says in an 
interview for the trade union daily PRACA today. 
  Slovak political instability, including that of the 
government, is a reality which disturbs the Slovaks and raises 
doubts about the country among foreign investors, Kovac says, 
adding that although blame for this does not lie squarely with 
Meciar and his government, they cannot be spared it. 
  Rejecting a campaign aimed at discrediting his person, he 
says that it has been initiated by "people from the Movement for 
a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), including its chairman, deputy 
chairmen, and deputies." 
  At present, the government has enough powers to be 
efficient, 
he says, adding, "I believe the solution offered in the (Slovak) 
Constitution to be acceptable." 
  Accusations leveled by Meciar that Kovac has triggered the 
factional strife within the HZDS are false, Kovac says, adding 
that in his meetings at their request with HZDS deputies they 
ask him to explain his relations with the government. "I am 
open with them, and my criticism includes myself." 
  Kovac also says that Meciar has informed him of cases of 
deputies who requested 50 million korunas for their offers to 
support HZDS. Corruption is rumored to be more and more 
widespread, but on the other hand no steps have been taken to 
prove it, Kovac says in the paper, adding that he urged Meciar 
to "act against such people." 
  "Accusations of corruption should be made only when it is 
possible to prove them," Kovac says, adding that empty 
corruption accusations tarnish Slovakia's image. 
  Calling the law on the defamation of the republic a "relic 
of 
socialism," he says he is ready to sign an amendment to it as 
soon as it is approved by parliament. 
  State Secretary and Government Office Head Ivan Lexa is 
being 
investigated on charges of violating the defamation law in 
connection with pronouncements he made after Kovac repeatedly 
refused to approve his appointment as privatization minister. 
  The government itself proposed last week that the 
appropriate 
articles of the law be repealed, but parliament declined to put 
the issue on its February agenda.

  [Text] Casta-Papiernicka, West Slovakia Feb 9 (CTK) -- The 
parliamentary groups of the government coalition parties and the 
cabinet today started a two-day meeting aimed at finding a way 
out of the current parliamentary crisis in Slovakia. 
  The meeting was joined by Premier Vladimir Meciar after his 
return from Brussels, where he signed the Partnership for Peace 
plan at NATO's headquarters. 
  The Slovak parliament was stalemated last week when the 
deputies from the government Movement For a Democratic Slovakia 
(HZDS) and the Slovak National Party (SNS) walked out of the 
parliament at the moment when the coalition's and the 
opposition's balance of forces was 75-75. 
  Ivan Laluha, former chairman of the HZDS Group, told 
journalists that "this situation cannot prevail. It is not 
possible that a decision on whether or not the government 
remains be made at every parliamentary meeting, because this 
hampers the process of transformation. Early elections are one 
of possible solutions." 
  Laluha as well as Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik came out 
against Meciar's proposal to solve the situation through a 
referendum. 
  In it citizens would decide on whether or not the deputies 
who left the parties and movements for which they had been 
elected to the parliament should leave the parliament. In this 
way, the government camp would gain back the parliamentary 
majority.

  [Text] Casta-Papiernicka, West Slovakia Feb 10 (CTK) -- At 
a meeting between parliamentary groups of deputies from the 
coalition parties and cabinet members last night, Deputy Premier 
Roman Kovac pointed out that a difference in opinion exists 
between him and Premier Vladimir Meciar, Tibor Cabaj, chairman 
of the Movement For a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) parliamentary 
group of deputies said after the meeting. The ruling coalition 
includes the HZDS and the Slovak National Party (SNS). 
  "There is not any disagreement", he said, adding that no new 
faction has formed within the HZDS as yet, although two 
unspecified deputy chairmen of a deputies' group of deputies 
offered their resignation, to be considered today. 
  Earlier yesterday, Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik and 
Deputy 
Ivan Laluha hinted at polarisation within the HZDS when they 
told journalists that they had rejected Meciar's proposal to 
hold referendum over the expulsion from the parliament of 
deputies who strayed from their mother parties. 
  The meeting also discussed the parliamentary stalemate, 
brought on by the walkout of the coalition deputies, Cabaj said, 
adding that he believed the parliamentary session would continue 
as planned on February 16. Meciar told the meeting about an 
unofficial offer from the Democratic Left Party (SDL) for a 
wider coalition, Cabaj said. 
  But SDL Chairman Peter Weiss today refused the idea of a 
coalition with the HZDS. 
  The SNS would only take a decision over the proposed 
referendum on the maverick deputies after an SNS extraordinary 
congress was held on February 19, chairman of the SNS 
parliamentary group, Miloslav Kona, said. 
  "Everything is possible and everything depends on the 
conditions," he added, reflecting on a possible coalition with 
the SDL. 
  The congress will try to resolve the rift within the SNS.

  [Text] Bratislava Feb 10 (CTK) -- Coalition with the 
governing Movement For a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and the 
Slovak National Party (SNS) is currently not "intellectually 
attractive" for the Democratic Left Party (SDL), SDL Chairman 
Peter Weiss told journalists on Wednesday [9 February]. 
  He said he could not imagine on what basis a coalition could 
function if the governing parties preserve their current policy. 
"I cannot imagine how members of the current cabinet such as 
Roman Hofbauer, Marian Andel and Jozef Prokes would sit in the 
government along with SDL Deputies Milan Ftacnik, Robert Fic and 
Ludomir Fogas" Weiss said. 
  He pointed to a scenario drafted by the HZDS which seeks to 
again win a majority in parliament through calling a referendum. 
These efforts are aimed at installing either a presidential 
regime or a chancellor system, Weiss said. 
  He voiced the view that the latest parliamentary crisis when 
HZDS deputies and part of SNS deputies purposefully postponed 
parliamentary discussion on the law on large privatisation 
"questioned parliament as institution". Government coalition 
deputies made their further presence at the parliamentary 
session conditional on the ruling of the Constitutional Court on 
the dispute whether or not deputies can deprive (in a vote) the 
chairman of parliament of the right to chair a parliamentary 
meeting. 
  Weiss described as politically expedient statements Slovak 
Premier and HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar's offer -- reiterated 
publicly -- that the SDL form an open coalition with the current 
government coalition parties. Weiss said this offer lacked the 
support of the decisive HZDS and SNS bodies.

  [Text] Bratislava, February 10 (CTK) -- "The long awaited 
and often forecast alternative platform within the HZDS 
(Movement for a Democratic Slovakia) is as of yesterday a 
probable reality," the independent daily NARODNA OBRODA writes. 
  Early on Wednesday [9 February] morning at a meeting with 
Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik, allegedly "a call was born, 
which will probably grow into a 16-member platform," the paper 
says. 
  "Two sources have told us independently that it was a 
declaration about two and a half pages long, in which the 
members of the alternative announce their desire for a broad 
coalition without the participation of the top members of 
political parties and movements. They consider this solution a 
temporary one, because they are counting on an agreement on 
early elections being called next year," NARODNA OBRODA writes. 
  The call was preceded by Friday's [4 February] summoning of 
deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac by Slovak Prime Minister and 
HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar, who accused him of proceeding 
incorrectly during the parliamentary crisis in organizing the 
active participation of several deputies' groups in parliament. 
Reservations concerning Kovac and Moravcik were heard at the 
HZDS on Monday [7 February], the paper notes. 
  An alternative program within the governing movement did not 
have to radically influence the change in the balance of power 
in parliament. "Nor can it be ruled out that the new platform 
will continue to vote in unison with the coalition and the 
balance between the HZDS and the opposition, a pair of horses, 
will be preserved," the paper writes. 
  At the same time, though, the declaration in favor of a 
wider 
coalition without top party members and in favor of early 
election is an "indirect declaration by part of the movement of 
lack of confidence in the methods and style of Prime Minister 
Vladimir Meciar's work," the paper believes. 
  "The clash of these two conceptions could end with the 
faction's defeat at a party assembly, but the snowball effect in 
the HZDS could also bury its leader under an avalanche," says 
NARODNA OBRODA.

  [Text] Casta Papiernicka, west Slovakia, Feb 10 (CTK) -- 
Vladimir Bajan and Marian Kelemen, the deputy chairmen of the 
ruling Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), resigned from 
their positions at the meeting of the HZDS Club of Deputies, a 
spokeswomen for the party told journalists today. 
  The meeting, which started on Wednesday (9 February), was 
originally expected to deal with the creation of a parliamentary 
majority, but it is, in fact, busy with maintaining the unity of 
the HZDS. 
  The meeting was attended by Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik, 
Transport Minister Roman Hofbauer, Agriculture Minister Jozef 
Baco and Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac today. In addition, 
representatives of the Slovak National Party (SNS), the minor 
coalition party, were present but when the internal HZDS affairs 
were discussed, they left the room. 
  According to the independent daily NARODNA OBRODA, the 
"alternative faction" in the HZDS led by Moravcik and Kovac came 
into being on Wednesday. No one has, however, confirmed the 
information. 
  The paper claimed that the 16-deputies-strong faction 
advocated the idea of creating a broad government coalition 
without participation of party leaders. They consider the 
solution to be temporary as they assume early elections called 
for early 1995.

  [Text] Bratislava, Feb 10 (CTK) -- The most realistic and 
democratic solution to the present political crisis in Slovakia 
would be to form a government without Prime Minister Vladimir 
Meciar, Frantisek Miklosko, vice-chairman of the opposition 
Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), told reporters today. 
  He said Meciar had placed his party, the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), before two alternatives: Either a 
referendum on the expulsion from parliament of the "maverick" 
HZDS deputies or early general elections in June 1994. The 
first alternative is undemocratic, the second unrealistic, he 
said. 
  The increasingly united opposition also has two choices in 
his view: Either a government without Meciar, for which one 
parliamentary vote would be lacking, or early elections but it 
is unlikely the opposition alone would succeed in passing the 
necessary constitutional law, Miklosko said. 
  KDH Chairman Jan Carnogursky said Meciar was the only 
politician it was impossible to agree with. In the course of 
time Milan Knazko, Rudolf Filkus, President Michal Kovac, 
Lubomir Dolgos have all fallen out with him, he said, adding 
that Roman Kovac and Jozef Moravcik also were defectors. 
  The various parties of the opposition, however, were able to 
agree on solutions to Slovakia's problems, voting together for 
instance on the law on large privatization, he said. 
  Carnogursky said it would not be responsible of the 
opposition to use the crisis situation in order to attempt a 
vote of no confidence in the government. 
  When asked if the opposition parties would arrange "round 
table" talks in the near future, Miklosko said "everything 
depends on today's results of the HZDS talks" in 
Casta-Papiernicka, west Slovakia.

  [Text] Bratislava, Feb 10 (CTK) -- "It is difficult to 
conduct a dialogue with a boor, I simply had to deny his 
allegation in a live broadcast," chairman of the opposition 
Alliance of Democrats Milan Knazko told journalists today, 
defending his Sunday statement on television that Prime Minister 
Vladimir Meciar was a liar. 
  Meciar had stated that all the opposition politicians were 
connected with crucial Slovak companies. 
  "I am economically clean, I do not conduct any business, 
having no interest in the key 21 Slovak enterprises. I make my 
living from a poor deputy's wages. As a result, Meciar's 
accusation is unfounded," said Knazko, a member of Meciar's 
cabinet as foreign minister until last March. 
  Knazko pointed to the fact that Meciar, who was involved in 
the drafting of the current Slovak Constitution, was striving 
today for the changes in it, for "new relations" between 
parliament and government, the government and the Castle 
(Presidential Office), attempting to create new centers of power.

  [Text] Bratislava, Feb 9 (CTK) -- More than one-third of 
ethnic Slovaks think that the activities of ethnic Hungarian 
political parties in Slovakia should be banned, while 27 percent 
of Hungarians think that Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) should be banned, the 
independent daily SME writes today. Twenty-one percent of 
Hungarians favor a ban on the coalition Slovak National Party 
(SNS), the paper writes. 
  The public opinion research was carried out by Glasgow 
University in cooperation with the Gallup polling firm between 
December 2 and 12, 1993. According to the poll of 667 Slovak 
citizens, HZDS supporters are more likely to favor a ban on 
ethnic Hungarian parties. Fifty-two percent of HZDS voters 
polled expressed this view. 
  Forty-three percent of SNS supporters, 36 percent of 
Democratic Left Party (SDL) supporters, and 18 percent of 
Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) supporters shared this view.

  [Text] Bratislava, Feb 10 (CTK) -- After a meeting between 
Slovak representatives and a group of senior officials of the 
French cabinet today, Slovak Deputy Prime Minister Jozef Prokes 
expressed himself for creating such security guarantees in 
Europe which would prevent possible destabilization in case of a 
crisis situation. 
  At the meeting, the aides of French Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur, currently visiting Slovakia, discussed the questions 
of European stability and the preparation of a conference on the 
issue to be held in Paris at the end of May, said Bernard de 
Monteferrand, Balladur's diplomatic adviser, and Thierry Dan, 
the adviser for strategic affairs. 
  Prokes said that "the opening of Western European markets 
will be the best aid for Slovakia," adding that European 
stability and the economic situation were interlinked. 
  Prokes also praised creating the basis of stability at the 
bilateral level. However, he said, it would not be suitable to 
draft different models for Western European countries and for 
Central European states, as originally suggested in the Balladur 
Plan. 
  Solution to ethnic minorities' status within the Balladur 
Plan cannot take into account the present situation alone, 
regardless of historical developments. "If the first is done, 
those countries could get advantage, which have got rid of their 
ethnic minorities," Prokes stressed. 
  He said the French guests admitted that first it was 
necessary to recongnise the principle of unalterability of 
borders, and only then to solve ethnic minority problems. 
  The Balladur Plan, now a joint initiative of the European 
Union, was conceived as a "preventative security" system 
directed toward countries having difficulty re-orienting 
themselves in postcommunist Europe. It is based on the ideas of 
the unalterability of state borders and individual rights for 
members of national minorities. 
  As discussed by Slovak hosts and French guests on Wednesday, 
applying the plan involves inviting to a May 26-27 conference in 
Paris those states which are considered front-runners for 
European Union membership. This means in particular the members 
of the Visegrad Group -- the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, 
and Poland.

<F P=106> [Judy Dempsey report: "US Move Brings New Hope For Bosnia </F>
Talks"] 
  [Text] Talks in Sarajevo this week could change the pace 
and direction of efforts for a settlement in Bosnia, when US 
diplomats put into effect Washington's decision to play a 
greater role in seeking a negotiated settlement for Bosnia. 
  Nato officials said this weekend that the presence of a team 
of US negotiators in Sarajevo could change the nature of the 
Geneva peace process, now that Washington -- belatedly -- has 
become actively involved and has thrown its weight behind Nato 
air strikes on Serb artillery batteries around the Bosnian 
capital. 
  "The problem with the Geneva negotiations is that they 
failed 
to motivate all three sides sufficiently to make them all sign 
up to a peace agreement," another Nato diplomat said. 
  "The threat of the use of force, which is real for once and 
other elements on the ground could really move along these 
talks." 
  The current peace plan drawn up by Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald 
Stoltenberg, envisages dividing Bosnia into three ethnic states, 
nominally within a republic of Bosnia. In practice, it would 
link Serb and Croat-controlled areas with their respective 
patron republics, leaving the Bosnian Moslem statelet vulnerable 
and sandwiched between two hostile states. 
  US officials, however, are unwilling to reveal what plan 
they 
will put on the table in Geneva when the talks reconvene at the 
end of this month. 
  "This process (in Geneva) has made a lot of progress. But it 
has not been able to bring it to a close, even though the 
negotiators keep saying the dffferences are very narrow. 
  "If so, why the delay? The Americans will try to stimulate 
the process in a different way that could get us to the end of 
the road," a diplomat said. 
  In becoming more engaged at Geneva, the US wants to 
establish 
"what is the Bosnian government's bottom line" for accepting 
peace; work out how to cement, or at least improve relations 
between Croatia and Bosnia, particularly in western Herzegovina; 
and establish at what price President Slobodan Milosevic of 
Serbia would make more concessions in order to have sanctions 
lifted. 
  Nato diplomats believe the Bosnians could accept peace if 
they knew that the territory they will control will be 
ethnically homogenous, will have access to the sea, and will be 
backed by an economic reconstruction programme. "Let's be 
clear. If the Bosnians are forced to sign, there will be no 
lasting peace. Also, the US will not twist their arm to accept 
the present plan. That will not bring a lasting peace," a Nato 
diplomat said. 
  The Croatians, who before the Bosnia war supported Serbia's 
carve-up of the republic between Belgrade and Zagreb, are slowly 
shifting their ground. In Geneva last week Croats and Bosnians 
discussed securing stability in western Herzegovina, especially 
in Mostar, the regional capital. 
  The city, which never received the attention that Sarajevo 
did, is almost rubble in the wake of Croat shelling, while in 
central Bosnia, also off the main headlines, scores of people 
are killed each day in clashes between Bosnian and Croat forces. 
  "The Croats know we are approaching the end-game, but this 
time from the western angle not the Serbian side. We are 
prepared to slap sanctions on them. They have gotten away with 
too much," the Nato official said. He added that President 
Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, an ally of Mr Milosevic, is now 
supporting the Nato strikes. 
  "The Croats are fickle. They back the winning side. They 
know the US could push for sanctions," he added. 
  Yet the US knows it is Mr Milosevic who can, with the 
crucial 
support of some hardliners on the ground in Sarajevo, hold the 
key to peace. 
  "Milosevic wants those sanctions lifted. The US is here now 
to motivate all the sides. We don't have a timetable. But one 
thing is sure. This war cannot be won militarily ... it has got 
to take advantage of what Nato has done. But to stop the 
suffering, all of them are going to have to find a negotiated 
political solution. That's the US message," the diplomat said. 
  But Nato diplomats admit that even if the threat of the Nato 
ultimatum can put pressure on the Geneva talks to reach an 
eventual settlement, it will be difficult for the three sides to 
trust one another, either at the negotiating table or on the 
ground. 
  "Each side has become so radicalised, and the Bosnians often 
feel they were being treated the same, as if they were equally 
to blame for the war at Geneva," a Nato diplomat said. He said 
the US would "try to promote trust" among the Bosnian 
delegation, and the other two sides. 
  "It won't be easy," he continued. "But by having having the 
US on board, all three sides will realise that behind that 
presence is Nato. That could well speed up the negotiations. 
But nobody lays hostage to fortune in these talks."

  [Text] Tirana, February 12 (ATA) -- The Albanian Sciences 
Academy denounced today the recent anticivilized and repressive 
Serbian act toward the Academy of Sciences and Arts of Kosova. 
  "It is evident for the workers of the Academy of Sciences of

measures taken by Serbian authorities against the Albanian 
people, the Albanian language and education and the endeavour 
for affirmation of the Albanian culture and science. This act 
follows the arbitral decisions of the Serbian Assembly for 
abolishing the Academy of Arts and Sciences of Kosova," was 
written in a protest note issued yesterday. 
  The note appeals to the international community, science 
circles, to protest against this act, to solve the international 
position of Kosova in conformity with the international rights 
and its people will.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Norwegian Colonel Bengt Berlin by </F>
Anthony Loyd in Tuzla; date not given] 
  [Text] To open Tuzla airfield Lieutenant Colonel Bengt 
Berlin wants Leopard tanks. He also wants close air support. 
In the wake of Sarajevo's market massacre and the subsequent 
Western show of resolve, he may get both. 
  Colonel Berlin is second-in-command of the Tuzla-based 
Nordic 
Battalion, a composite unit including Swedes, Danes and 
Norwegians. His dry manner and piercing gaze through tinted, 
circular spectacles add a sinister edge to this belligerent 
Norseman. In November he deployed a Milan anti-tank missile and 
strike aircraft in an intimidatory role to secure the release of 
three Swedish soldiers taken hostage by a platoon of renegade 
Chetniks near Vares. 
  Now he has been ordered to prepare Tuzla airfield, closed 
since its destruction by the retreating Yugoslav National Army 
in May 1992, for UN aid flights. He has some definite ideas as 
to how to go about it. 
  "If anyone shoots at us with small arms, then we return fire 
with small arms. If it is heavy machinegun fire, then we reply 
with heavy machineguns. If they shoot at us with a tank, we 
must reply with a tank. Artillery we cannot see, so the only 
thing we can hit back with is close air support," he said in his 
forward headquarters near the damaged runway. 
  In addition to forcing the withdrawal of Serb guns around 
Sarajevo and effecting the UN troop rotation in Srebrenica, the 
UN has postulated close air support as a means of opening up 
Tuzla airfield. Now, in its present mood, which no longer 
agonises over potential withdrawal but instead over how, what 
and where to strike, the Swedes are within three weeks of 
preparing the airfield. 
  A stream of pilots, flight engineers and logistics experts 
have added their advice on layout and flight path. Built for 
military purposes in 1962, the airport could enable the UN to 
fly up to 200 tons of aid per day at maximum capacity directly 
into Bosnia, avoiding the overland routes through Herzegovina 
and Serbia. 
  "At present all aid has to pass through Bosnian Serb or 
Bosnian Croat territory. That means the warring parties have 
total control over everything coming into Bosnia," said Colonel 
Berlin "So its opening is a high-priority operation." 
  The Serbs are unhappy at the prospect and shell the runway 
regularly from hillsides only five miles to the east, with 
artillery and tank fire. A flow of aid into Bosnia over which 
they had no control would deprive them of a valuable bargaining 
chip. So in addition to the technical lighting, control, repair 
and instrument landing systems, Colonel Berlin wants his ten 
Leopard tanks, Ianguishing in Split on the Dalmatian coast as 
the UN prevaricates over details regarding their suitability in 
an aid operation. 
  "We need them, because if we are determined to open the 
airfield we must stay even if we are shelled," said the colonel. 
"The only thing we can do that with, at reasonable risk to my 
soldiers, is main battletanks." He plans to deploy the tanks 
first to secure the perimeter, then to provide mobile 
observation posts to monitor the Serb position that threaten the 
operation. Earlier wrangling between the UN and Bosnian Serbs 
over approval of the plan, in which the Serbs demanded the right 
to open their military airfield at Banja Luka in return for 
stopping their bombardments, have subsided as talk by Lieutenant 
General Sir Michael Rose of "determined approach", "robust 
means" and "consequences" takes effect. 
  "Unprofor [UN Protection Forces] doesn't have to have the 
approval of the Serbs to open Tuzla airfield. It would be 
entirely run by the UN, with Bosnian Serb monitors present, in 
the same way as Sarajevo," said Colonel Berlin. "The UN mandate 
here is to feed the needy population. That involves opening 
roads and Tuzla airfield. It is all part of the mission. We 
should be respected as a third party that is not part of the 
war. If someone doesn't respect us, they must take the 
consequences. Consequences are something they have not been 
taking recently."

  [Text] Sofia, February 12 (BTA) -- I took part in informal 
discussions which may help the peaceful solution of the conflict 
in the former Yugoslavia, Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov 
said today upon his arrival from Geneva, where he attended a 
meeting of the foreign ministers of the countries neighbouring 
on Yugoslavia, organized by Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg. 
According to Mr. Daskalov, the meeting was useful and the 
participants expressed a wish to hold, if necessary, similar 
meetings in future as well. 
  The main issues discussed at the meeting were how the 
neighbouring countries could help the solution of the crisis in 
the former Yugoslavia and the impact of the Yugo-embargo on 
them. A report was circulated unofficially estimating the 
Yugo-embargo losses sustained by the neighbouring countries, 
Foreign Minister Daskalov said. Each of the participating 
countries is to make its comments on this report. 
  Bulgaria has invariably been for a peaceful solution and 
non-intervention in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. But 
should the need arise to resort to restricted air strikes as an 
extreme measure, these should meet a number of conditions, the 
Bulgarian foreign minister said regarding the NATO ultimatum. 
According to him, these conditions are that the air strikes 
result in no casualties among the peaceful population, that they 
do not lead to the spread of the conflict and that they do not 
threaten neighbouring states. 
  At the meeting no one gave guarantees that neighbouring 
countries would not be affected, Foreign Minister Daskalov said.

  [Text] Sofia, February 12 (BTA) -- "Air strikes in Bosnia 
would result in a fresh escalation of the conflict but within 
the boundaries of Bosnia-Herzegovina," Bulgarian intelligence 
chief General Brigo Asparukhov said in an interview for the 
Panorama weekly political round-up show of Bulgarian National 
Television. He described as strange the allegations of 24 CHASA 
-- the daily of the largest circulation in Bulgaria, about his 
prediction of a Balkan war and Bulgaria's involvement in it. 
Last Thursday [10 February] 24 CHASA reported of a statement 
made by General Asparukhov at a closed door session of the 
Parliamentary National Security Committee that "air strikes in 
Bosnia pose the greatest threat to Bulgaria's national security 
in 50 years." "This is the first time in 50 years that war is 
being waged near Bulgaria's borders and this fact should not be 
neglected and should keep us on our guard," the Bulgarian 
intelligence chief said tonight. He called the allegations of 
24 CHASA that his views on Bulgaria's attitude to the 
Yugo-crisis differ from those of Deputy Defence Minister Boyko 
Noev mere speculation. 
  "Bulgaria has always been for a peaceful solution of the 
conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina," Bulgarian Foreign Minister 
Stanislav Daskalov said in Panorama in response to a question on 
possible air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs. He recalled 
that the first section of NATO's resolution of February 9 sets 
the peaceful solution of the crisis as the principal goal of the 
organization. If NATO's decision for air strikes against the 
Bosnian Serbs is brought into operation, there should be 
guarantees that there will be no casualties among the civilian 
population and that these air strikes will not lead to a spread 
of the conflict, Foreign Minister Daskalov said. 
  According to a regular poll among 100 prominent Bulgarian 
journalists, less than 8 percent believe that there will be air 
strikes in Bosnia, 84 percent do not believe this, and 8 percent 
are not sure.

<F P=106> [From BTA press review] </F>
  [Text] Sofia, February 12 (BTA) -- STANDART NEWS and 
DEMOKRATSIYA lead with yesterday's statement of the Turkish 
ambassador in Sofia that Turkey has not asked Bulgaria for 
overflight rights. The press reports on President Zhelev's 
consultations yesterday with the political forces and with two 
deputy ministers before his departure to Brussels on Monday, 
where he is expected to sign the Partnership for Peace 
initiative. According to OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK, there were no 
differences of opinion on this issue. This is confirmed by 
statements by participants in the consultations cited by the 
Socialists' DUMA and DEMOKRATSIYA, the daily of the Union of 
Democratic Forces (SDS), which marks its fourth anniversary 
today. 
  "There is no change in Bulgaria's stand on Bosnia, MP's said 
after a meeting at the Presidency," STANDART NEWS writes. The 
daily adds that Deputy Foreign Minister Todor Churov confirmed 
the stand of the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry that "military 
intervention would be admissible only if it localizes the 
conflict and does not threaten the peaceful population." 
"Zhelev Inclined To Support Air Strikes in Bosnia," a headline 
in 24 CHASA reads. This daily writes that at yesterday's 
meeting President Zhelev handed out a draft stand of Bulgaria on 
the Yugo-conflict which sets forth in eight points the 
principles of Bulgaria's non-involvement: non- involvement in 
the war, observation of the sanctions, an appeal to the 
neighbouring and Balkan countries not to get involved in the 
conflict, and support of international initiatives for a 
peaceful solution. "Mr. Zhelev is inclined to support air 
strikes against military targets in Bosnia only as an extreme 
measure and only if NATO guarantees that these strikes would not 
affect civilians," 24 CHASA writes, adding that the Bulgarian 
Socialist Party (BSP, of the former Communists) was 
categorically against the final point and demanded its revision. 
Nikolay Slatinski, chief of the Parliamentary National Security 
Committee, is also against air strikes. According to 24 CHASA, 
the president promised to hold a meeting of experts to finalize 
the text of Bulgaria's stand after his visit to Brussels. TRUD 
writes that yesterday President Zhelev received a negative 
answer from representatives of the legislative and the executive 
to his question on whether he should offer Bulgaria's indirect 
participation in possible NATO operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
STANDART NEWS reports that Prime Minister Berov was also 
invited to the meeting but did not come. Instead, "he met 
Russian Ambassador in Sofia Aleksandr Avdeyev, who acquainted 
him with the stand of the Russian Federation on NATO's proposal 
for the solution of the Yugo-crisis," STANDART NEWS writes. 
  The press quotes a statement by the president's spokesman 
that in Brussels Zhelev will reply to the letter of the Turkish 
president asking him to support military intervention in Bosnia.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 11 (CTK) -- The Czech Foreign Ministry 
has said it considers the NATO Council's decision about a 
possible armed intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina to protect the 
civilian population a serious step which can markedly contribute 
to progress in the Geneva peace talks. 
  In its statement given to CTK today, the ministry reiterated 
its opinion that any external military intervention alone could 
not produce settlement of the situation unless all the three 
feuding parties display will and ability to reach agreement. 
  The ministry said it believed that the warring parties would 
withdraw heavy weaponry from Sarajevo's surroundings within the 
10-day deadline given them by the NATO Council, and that they 
would show real political will not only to introduce an 
effective cease- fire, but to find an acceptable way out of the 
crisis as well. 
  The ministry said it believed that the previous resolutions 
adopted by the UN Security Council provided a sufficient legal 
basis for aerial attacks under conditions set by the United 
Nations earlier.

  [Text] Prague, February 14 (CTK) -- Czech Premier Vaclav 
Klaus told journalists today he was "fully convinced" that no 
NATO air strikes would be made at Serb positions near Sarajevo. 
  Speaking after a cabinet session, he also said the Czech 
side 
believed that the core to the solution was a "domestic 
agreement," and outside intervention could only supplement, and 
not replace, a domestic solution to the situation. 
  Klaus said no representative of the Czech Republic had 
criticized the NATO Council's decision to bombard the positions 
of Bosnian Serbs if the Council's ultimatum was not upheld. 
"Nobody, including me, has made any statements concerning how we 
would react in the event of attacks," he said. 
  Last Thursday [10 February] Klaus said the Czech Government 
and the Civic Democratic Party (ODS, of which he is chairman) 
were afraid there would be outside military intervention in 
Bosnia and were of the opinion that civil war should not be 
ended by foreign intervention but by settlement at home. He 
said that he personally considered the possible air strikes 
approved by the NATO Council on Wednesday as "unfair from a 
human point of view." 
  Klaus stressed today that it was not the task of the Czech 
Republic to find a way of solving the crisis in Bosnia. As far 
as the difference between the standpoints of President Vaclav 
Havel and Deputy Premier Jan Kalvoda, both of whom support 
NATO's position, and his standpoint was concerned, it was 
unnecessary to consider the difference a dispute.

  [Text] New York, Feb 14 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic 
welcomes NATO's clear and unambiguous readiness to intervene in 
Bosnia on behalf of the international community, Czech 
Ambassador to the U.N. Security Council Karel Kovanda said at 
the meeting of the Council today. 
  "The threat of unleashing air strikes cannot be seen in 
isolation but as part of wider measures, he said, adding that 
"on its own, it will not solve anything because the solution 
will have to involve all three parties to the conflict," he 
said. [quotation marks as received] 
  "The threatening stance has been agreed on to prevent 
Sarajevo from suffocation and provide it with a chance to come 
under U.N. supervision if the parties involved so wish," he 
said, adding that the U.N.'s threatening stance will help the 
parties to the conflict negotiate a solution. 
  "Allow me to say that we recognized it as a matter beyond 
doubt that since last summer, secretary general has had the 
powers to authorize air raids on heavy artillery positions 
responsible for attacks on civilians," Kovanda said, referring 
to the demands for a new document on the issue. 
  Contrary to the Western states, who are opposed to any such 
move, Russia repeatedly proposed that the Council adopt a new 
resolution on Sarajevo.

  [Text] Ostrava, North Moravia, Feb 11 (CTK) -- If NATO 
carries out air strikes in Bosnia the Czech contingent in 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] should be withdrawn, deputy and 
spokesperson for the Czech-Moravian Centrist Party (CMSS) Rudolf 
Opatril told reporters today. 
  NATO military action would expose the Czech troops to 
retaliatory strikes, for which they are not equipped, he said. 
"Czech soldiers did not go into that area to make peace but to 
ensure peace," he said. 
  The Czech contingent is stationed in the Serbian enclave of 
Krajina in Croatia near the border with Bosnia and about 200 km 
west of Sarajevo. 
  Opatril said the CMSS agreed with Prime Minister Vaclav 
Klaus's statement on Thursday [10 February] favoring an internal 
settlement of the conflict rather than external intervention. 
The CMSS has eight members in parliament.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 11 (CTK) -- Thursday's [10 February] 
decision of the Slovak customs authorities not to allow food 
products without a quality certificate to enter the country as 
of today is the first major mistake in the functioning of the 
Czech-Slovak customs union, Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir 
Dlouhy told CTK today. Dlouhy said he would ask for the Customs 
Union Council to be called. 
  Slovakia was attempting to protect the balance of payments 
by 
misusing technical obstacles to trade in a situation where such 
steps were indefensible, he said. 
  The Czech Republic was informed of the measure only 24 hours 
before it came into effect, he said. Slovakia had merely 
carried out its formal obligations, but usually in similar cases 
the supplier is given more time to adapt to the new conditions, 
Dlouhy said. 
  The Customs Union Agreement allows either country to take 
such a measure if it is essential for "the protection of life or 
health of people, animals or plants," he pointed out, but in his 
view this was not the case. The measure is directed against all 
countries not just the Czech Republic, he added.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 14 (CTK) -- Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus 
telephoned Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar to ask Slovakia to 
abandon its requirement that all imported food products carry a 
quality certificate, Klaus said today after the cabinet had 
debated the measure. He said Meciar promised him the Slovak 
Government would "seriously consider" Klaus's request on Tuesday 
[15 February]. Slovakia introduced the unilateral measure on 
February 11, one day after informing the Czech customs 
authorities. 
  Klaus said the requirement should be revoked at least until 
the next extraordinary meeting of the Customs Union Council. "We 
do not consider (the measure) right and fair," he said, adding 
it was made possible in his view by ambiguities in the minutes 
from the last Customs Union Council meeting. Both the Czech and 
Slovaks would probably interpret the minutes differently, which 
may prove to be an obstacle to resolving the problem, he said. 
  The Czech Republic does categorically not agree that 
Slovakia's trade balance with it should be "artificially 
improved" by impeding the access of Czech goods to the Slovak 
market in this way, he said. 
  "It is, I think, evident that the measure was not provoked 
by 
our having bad quality food products but by something else," he 
said. A similar counter-measure by the Czechs would be "the 
stupidest thing" to do in reaction to Slovakia's decision, he 
said.

  [Text] Prague Feb 13 (CTK) -- Czech President Vaclav 
Havel's visit to India and Thailand last week was meant to 
indicate that despite the Czech Republic's interest in 
membership in the European Union and other similar structures of 
integration, the country was not taking a "Eurocentrist" stand, 
the president said on Czech Radio today. 
  The president's speech was recorded in Thailand, during his 
visit there. "Our foreign policy is aware of the world's 
current interconnections," Havel continued, adding that 
especially now that the Czech Republic had become a member of 
the UN Security Council it did want to carry a "commensurate 
portion of responsibility for the current state of the world." 
  Havel also said that talk is often heard of the chasm 
separating the wealthy north and the poor south, but many who 
speak of the problem do not even know enough about it or do not 
really care. 
  He noted that the Indian section of his tour was planned a 
little unconventionally, in that it did not include those 
locations usually seen during state visits, and was informal. 
The president pointed out that India was a functioning 
democracy despite the great problems it was experiencing, and 
its enormous number of citizens, nationalities and religions. 
Havel called it a "phenomenal" fact, even more so when viewed 
by someone who comes from a country where "we are constantly 
fighting to find a political culture under conditions of a 
relatively prospering, relatively homogeneous nation of ten 
million." 
  Speaking about his visit to Thailand, Havel said democratic 
structures were beginning to function in that country. Its 
earlier "more authoritative" government had protected Thailand 
from communism, he said, adding that he found it interesting 
that the country had always managed to resist "various dangers 
from the outside" and had never become a colony.

  [Text] Prague Feb 13 (CTK) -- Europe should be able to 
create a new security structure allowing the prevention of 
conflicts, both regional and those with wider significance, 
following the fundamental changes it has gone through, the Czech 
defence minister said Sunday [13 February]. 
  Speaking on the Czech Television programme "Debata", Antonin 
Baudys said that, following the fall of communism and the 
breakup of the Soviet Union, the Czech Republic wanted to become 
a "reliable and trustworthy" part of such a security structure. 
  Only a country felt to be reliable, by its neighbours and by 
the rest of the world, not only a democratic state, but one able 
to defend itself against an enemy, and clearly declaring its 
intention to defend its integrity and independence, can prosper, 
the minister said. "Armed forces, effective armed forces, are 
an expression of that," Baudys said. 
  The task and goal of the transformation of the Czech Army, 
begun by the Ministry in July 1993, is to structure and reform 
it in order to make it the counterpart to the armed forces of 
standard European democracies. 
  The complexity of that problem, and the Czech Army's small 
size, prompted the Ministry to work out a concept consisting of 
a shorter- term programme running somewhat over two years, and 
another expected to take until the year 2000, Baudys said. 
  He explained that the quicker measures would entail making 
the structure of the Czech Armed Forces compatible with those of 
NATO countries, switching to a system of brigades from a 
divisional structure, for example. 
  The minister said a completely new personnel system was 
important, as it would prepare the forces for a system of 
services. Significant personnel changes had already been made, 
he said, adding, however, that a broad measure such as 
reassessment of all graduates of Soviet military colleges was 
not called for. 
  The Armed Forces need to be built with the best available, 
Baudys said, though even better experts will come in the future. 
To that end, the Ministry was looking for ways to make the 
military profession interesting to young people, he added. A 
significant problem, he noted, was the change to a new method of 
financing and budgeting, as well. 
  The first steps in the transformation -- civilian 
leadership, 
control by parliament, and making spending visible -- had been 
made much earlier, during the middle of last year, Baudys said. 
Now, after the starting of "Partnership for Peace," the 
Ministry was discovering that these measures fulfilled precisely 
the NATO conditions for armies that want to become part of that 
initiative. 
  Baudys said he was convinced individuals' confidence in the 
Czech Armed Forces was on the rise. He pointed to the increase 
in neutral news articles regarding the institution which he had 
received from statistical surveys of the media during the last 
three years.

  [Text] Budapest, 13 February (MTI) -- The Hungarian 
diplomats accredited to Yugoslavia and their families will 
continue to stay in Belgrade, Hungarian foreign affairs 
spokesman Janos Herman told MTI today. Hungary has not made any 
decision on recalling its diplomatic staff from Belgrade, he 
said. 
  The Hungarian Foreign Ministry has been formally informed 
that some diplomatic missions in Belgrade have started 
preparations for evacuation. Since Belgrade cannot be left by 
air, Hungary offers itself as an obvious transit route for the 
departing diplomats. On request, the Foreign Ministry will 
render every possible assistance to them, Herman said.

  [Text] Budapest, 11 February (MTI) -- Hungarian Foreign 
Minister Geza Jeszenszky has asked the United Nations to set up 
a special fund to alleviate economic damage caused to Hungary by 
the UN-sponsored embargo on rump Yugoslavia, Hungarian cabinet 
spokesperson Judit Juhasz told reporters today. 
  This week the cabinet heard a report by Jeszenszky on the 
consequences of the embargo, she said. According to the report, 
UN member-states are not automatically entitled to financial 
compensation for losses caused by UN actions, Juhasz said. 
  On a Hungarian proposal, the UN Security Council declared 
that Hungary needs assistance in solving economic hardships 
stemming from observance of the UN resolution. For this reason, 
the Security Council appealed to the UN member states to provide 
direct technical and financial assistance to easing the harmful 
consequences. 
  The United Nations qualified Hungary's temporarily 
suspending 
its contribution to the UN budget as an acceptable way of 
alleviating economic difficulties.

  [Text] Budapest, 13 February (MTI) -- "What the Hungarian 
nation wants to have after the May 8 elections is better, more, 
fairer, and more efficient than it has today. It is uncertain, 
though, that it wants something fundamentally different," Laszlo 
Surjan, chairman of the Christian Democratic People's Party 
(KDNP) and welfare minister, told a rally marking the beginning 
of his party's electoral campaign today. 
  The chairman of the smallest party of the governing 
coalition 
said the Christian Democrats rejected Prime Minister Peter 
Boross's statement that the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) is 
the only force able to govern the country. "We consider 
ourselves fit for the task," Surjan said. He added, however, 
that the Christian Democrats stand the closest to the MDF. 
  Outlining the priorities of the KDNP's electoral manifesto, 
Surjan said that the Christian Democrats pressed for a 
calculable legislature, and wished to guarantee a safe and 
calculable future for the people. 
  Making a critical approach to the past four years, the KDNP 
chairman said the state had got rid of its oversized tasks too 
quickly and left society unprepared to face a multitude of 
problems. The Christian Democrats wish that the state should 
assume responsibility for, rather than intervene in, the 
economy. "We want to have a strong rule of law and stable 
public security," Surjan said.

  [Text] Budapest, 13 February (MTI) -- In all likelihood, 
Gyula Horn, chairman of the opposition Hungarian Socialist Party 
(MSZP), will head his party's national list in the parliamentary 
elections set for May 8. 
  The second place on the list is occupied by Sandor Nagy, 
president of the National Confederation of Hungarian Trade 
Unions (MSZOSZ), and the third by former finance minister Laszlo 
Bekesi, member of Parliament. 
  The list was compiled at the joint session of the party's 
National Presidium and Board on Saturday [12 February], and will 
be finalized at a party congress on February 27. 
  Horn told reporters that the top places of the list are 
occupied by senior party officials and deputies, who were 
particularly active in the past four years. In a move to open 
towards society, the list includes plenty of non-party people, 
for instance political scientists, artists, and clergymen. 
  Addressing the joint session on Saturday, Sandor Nagy 
announced that the MSZOSZ accepted the MSZP's economic manifesto.

  [Text] Budapest, 13 February (MTI) -- The parliamentary 
system created over the past four years has become viable so it 
does not need to undergo any sweeping transformation. In the 
future, emphasis should rather be placed on improving its 
operation and increasing its efficiency, the draft electoral 
manifesto of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) says. 
  The 200-page document, which was distributed among members 
of 
the MDF National Board in Budapest this weekend, will be 
discussed and finalized by the party's three-day national 
congress next weekend. 
  The three chapters of the draft comprise the main issues of 
legislation, home affairs, foreign affairs, economy, 
agriculture, education, culture, health, and social welfare.

  [Text] Budapest, 11 February (MTI) -- Hungarian Prime 
Minister Peter Boross today met Presidents Bela Marko of the 
Democratic Hungarian Federation of Romania, Miklos Duray of the 
Coexistence Movement of Slovakia, Bela Bugar of the Hungarian 
Christian Democratic Movement of Slovakia, Andras Agoston of the 
Democratic Hungarian Community of Vojvodina, Sandor Fodo of the 
Cultural Association of Subcarpathian Hungarians, Arpad Pasza of 
the Democratic Hungarian Community of Croatia, and Maria 
Pozsonec of the Hungarian Minority Self-Governing Community of 
Slovenia's Mura region, in Budapest's Parliament. The meeting 
was also attended by World Federation of Hungarians President 
Sandor Csoori. 
  According to the government spokesman's office, Boross 
stressed his desire to follow the late prime minister Jozsef 
Antall's political concept regarding native Hungarians in the 
Carpathian basin. 
  In keeping with the government's August 1992 declaration, he 
proclaimed his continued support for all endeavors of 
cross-border Hungarians, formulated by their legitimate 
representatives in accordance with European integration ideas. 
  Leaders of Hungarian organizations beyond the border 
confirmed this as the minimum which they expect from Hungary's 
government and which they regard as a basis for future relations 
with Hungary. The sides stressed the role of such links in 
strengthening Central European stability. 
  Ethnic Hungarian leaders said they continue negotiations in 
an effort to attain recognition as a national community, enforce 
their regional and community self-governing rights on the 
principle of subsidiarity, and create partnership relations with 
the majority nations of their countries. To this end, they wish 
to use democratic means in expressing their political identity. 
  Boross said the principles professed by legitimate Hungarian 
organizations are in full harmony with the basic ideas of 
European integration and the Maastricht Agreement. 
  As several models similar to the plans for settling 
positions 
of the concerned communities have proven viable in Europe, the 
government of the Republic of Hungary supports the just 
endeavors of cross-border Hungarians by all possible, lawful 
means at their disposal. 
  Participants of the meeting assessed previous efforts aimed 
at bringing about a European stability agreement. They stated 
that such an accord can only fulfill its mission in stabilizing 
Central and Eastern Europe if the governments and the legitimate 
representatives of the national communities reach an 
understanding on the legal status of the given community. 
  The Hungarian Government believes this can also furnish 
adequate conditions for talks on the conclusion of bilateral 
agreements designed to ensure the region's long term stability. 
  The sides noted major, positive steps in bilateral ties 
between both the governments and ethnic Hungarian organizations, 
and between Hungary and the governments of Croatia, Slovenia, 
and Ukraine.

  [Text] Warsaw, Feb. 14 -- Foreign ministers of Poland and 
Slovenia, Andrzej Olechowski and Lojze Peterle, respectively, 
signed on Monday [14 February] an agreement on intergovernmental 
cooperation in education, culture and science and a protocol on 
cooperation between the two ministries. 
  Olechowski said that the signed agreements were like "stones 
of which a new Europe was being built." He also stressed that 
they would contribute to building relations between the nations 
that liked each other. 
  Earlier in the day, the two ministers held a meeting and 
chaired the plenary talks by the delegations of the foreign 
ministries of Poland and Slovenia. The talks were attended by 
Polish deputy minister for foreign economic relations Andrzej 
Bryt. 
  The talks focused on preparing bilateral economic agreements 
which were planned to cover protection of investments, avoidance 
of double taxation, transport, transfer of social benefits and 
re- admission. 
  Peterle said the agreements should be signed still this 
year. 
He stressed that the talks and decisions made on Monday were "a 
big step" designed to consolidate Polish-Slovenian and 
international cooperation in Central Europe on the 
Baltic-Adriatic line. 
  The two sides also discussed the situation in the Balkans. 
In the opinion Peterle, the recent developments in Bosnia show 
there is a possibility of reaching peace. He expressed hope 
that the European Community would help limit or even solve the 
conflict. 
  Peterle, who is holding both the post of foreign minister 
and 
deputy prime minister, said Slovenia was planning to establish 
its embassy in Warsaw. Poland announced at the beginning of 
January, 1994, that it decided to open its embassy in Ljubljana.

  [Text] Poznan, Feb. 14 -- The Democratic Union (UD) wants 
its unification with the Liberal-Democratic Congress (KLD) to 
result not only in a rise in membership but, above all, in 
opening up to people who are waiting for such a formation, UD 
leader Tadeusz Mazowiecki told a press conference today. 
  UD General Secretary Andrzej Machowski said the unification 
congress would be probably held at the end of April, 1994. 
  Asked to comment on the relations between the Polish Peasant 
Party (PSL) and the church, Mazowiecki said: "If the church 
supported the not very reformatory policy of the PSL, it would 
give rise to concern, and this is everything I can say." 
  Mazowiecki said it was "astounding" he was being compared 
with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak as far as changes in the 
posts of governors were concerned. He stressed that people 
forgot a few years ago he was working in completely different 
socio-political conditions. 
  "I have a critical opinion on today's personnel policy 
conducted by the PSL as it is not guided by competence but by 
party interest," Mazowiecki added.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 11/2/1994 -- The treaty of 
friendship and collaboration between Romania and Croatia will be 
signed during the Romanian visit by President Franjo Tudjman, 
scheduled on February 14-16. The visit will be "a fine 
opportunity to survey the bilateral relations that have marked 
tangible progress after President Iliescu's visit in Zagreb last 
year," said presidential spokesman Traian Chebeleu during a news 
conference on February 11. 
  Apart from the exchange of views on the Yugoslav crisis, the 
visit will also occasion the signing of an agreement on road 
transport and a protocol of collaboration in science and 
technology. 
  The schedule of the visit includes official talks between 
the 
two presidents, a dinner for the guest, a trip to Sinaia 
mountain resort, talks with Premier Nicolae Vacaroiu and the 
president and speaker of the parliament's two chambers. A last 
round of talks and the signing of the official documents are 
scheduled on February 16. 
  Ambassador Traian Chebeleu referred in his weekly news 
conference on February 11 also to various aspects of foreign 
policy including: the recent reference in Washington to a 
certain government coalition in Romania that would entail the 
withdrawal of the most favoured nation [MFN] status. "The MFN 
status," Chebeleu said, "was granted in certain conditions and I 
do not think any government, even the American one, could afford 
to condition the relations with Romania on a certain government 
coalition. Anyway, we care about the stands and give them due 
consideration, but we do not take them as belonging to the 
American Administration." 
  The presidential spokesman opined that the recent NATO 
decision on the Yugoslav crisis "has first of all the character 
of political pressure pursuing the continuation of the 
negotiations and then a humanitarian nature, being meant to help 
avoiding new attacks on the civil population." The NATO 
decision is "well-balanced and equidistant." It is not an 
ultimatum as such, Chebeleu said, but "a measure apt to favour 
the political process of settlement of the crisis." Romania 
shows "a certain reluctance as regards the use of force" and 
sustains in every way a peaceful settlement, Traian Chebeleu 
mentioned.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 15/2/1994 -- The Romanian head 
of state gave a dinner for the president of Croatia on Monday, 
February 14, at the close of the first round of 
Romanian-Croatian presidential talks. 
  Proposing a toast to the distinguished Croatian guest, 
Romanian President Ion Iliescu recalled with satisfaction his 
visit paid to Croatia last spring, the understandings and 
decisions adopted on that occasion, stressing that President 
Tudjman's visit to Romania opened up new prospects to the 
collaboration between the two countries, consistent with their 
mutual political will. 
  Referring to the situation in the region, to the next-door 
tragedy caused by the armed conflict in the territory of the 
former Yugoslavia, and to the effects of the embargo, felt by 
everyone, President Ion Iliescu stressed that as far as Romania 
was concerned, the best compensation for the economic losses 
sustained was the fastest normalization of the situation in the 
area of ex-Yugoslavia. "The escalation in the last period shows 
the necessity that confrontation be given up, that combat and 
military actions be ceased and all parties concerned give proof 
of utmost responsibility", President Iliescu assessed, 
reiterating Romania's stand for the seeking out of a political 
solution to the Yugoslav crisis and welcoming the steps taken on 
this line. Ion Iliescu also expressed his belief that Romania, 
through the bilateral relations with the states resulting from 
the former Yugoslavia, along with the efforts of the 
international community, would help remaking the stability, the 
climate of confidence among those states, the reinstatement of 
peace. 
  In turn, President Tudjman stressed in his toast that his 
country attached great importance to the relations with Romania, 
because Romania was the biggest country in south-eastern Europe 
and was very important in the area. Recalling that the two 
countries have lived through the same phenomena after 
totalitarianism fell apart, with similar effects in the economic 
and political domains alike, President Tudjman recalled the 
specific difficulties Croatia had to cope with because of the 
war. Drawing a picture of the former Yugoslavia whose unity 
Tito had managed to maintain, the Croatian president evoked the 
changes come about after Tito's passing away and in the new 
circumstances the wish for self-determination of the countries 
in the area, that could have been materialized, avoiding an 
armed conflict, if the countries involved had made efforts on 
this line. The recent signing of the agreement on the peaceful 
settlement would lead, the Croatian president said, with the 
support of the international community, Romania included, to the 
peaceful settlement of the conflict. 
  Assessing the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina as one of the 
most 
intricate crisis in the world, the Croatian head of state 
cautioned that one must not forget that it was precisely in 
Sarajevo that the first world war too, had started, and hoped 
that history should not recur, in consideration of the current 
armed conflict. 
  Evoking the international consensus on the situation in the 
former Yugoslavia, Franjo Tudjman hoped that the conflicting 
countries too, would find a common, peaceful way of settling the 
situation. "The war in Bosnia-Herzegovina has come to a climax 
and this is the moment at which we can reach a political 
settlement or see the expansion and worsening of the conflict in 
this part of the world", the Croatian president stressed, 
expressing his confidence in the way of peaceful settlement, for 
the benefit of the peoples in the area.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 15/02/1994 -- Croatian 
President Franjo Tudjman, now visiting Romania, had an interview 
at the Chamber of Deputies headquarters with the parliament's 
president and speaker, Oliviu Gherman and Adrian Nastase, on 
February 15 morning. 
  They exchanged information and views on the organization and 
functioning of the legislative institutions in the two countries. 
  Romanian parliamentary representatives offered the Romanian 
legislative forum's involvement in the peace process in the 
former Yugoslavia, especially in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The 
Croatian president showed interest in the Romanian offer. 
  The interview was attended by Ioan Lup, vice-president of 
the 
Senate, and Ion Ratiu, deputy speaker of the Chamber of Deputies. 
  President Tudjman will meet today also with Romanian Prime 
Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, will take a short trip to the Prahova 
Valley, and meet with representatives with the Croatian minority 
of Romania later in the evening.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 15/02/1994 -- Desimir Jeftic, 
Yugoslavia's ambassador in Bucharest, told ROMPRES that the 
relations between Yugoslavia and Romania were kept in "very 
specific conditions" because of the embargo imposed on 
Yugoslavia, which disadvantages the development of 
collaboration. "I should however say that the Yugoslav-Romanian 
relations have managed to maintain the well-known 
characteristics of traditional friendship, a high level of 
understanding, confidence, interest and readiness for 
collaboration. Obviously, in conditions of unjustified and 
inhuman sanctions which Romania too, has to observe, despite the 
tremendous damages it sustains, the concrete collaboration in 
the economy, and even in culture and sports, has recorded 
terrible losses. Suffice it to mention that the goods exchange 
between our countries before the sanctions stood at $500 million 
for the first half of 1992 and was showing an upward tendency. 
Many deals started together were stopped, but both parties are 
making efforts for the existing links not to be severed, and for 
waiting for the period after the embargo is lifted with ready 
documents and articulated ideas for the continuation of 
collaboration at high pace. I would mention one more important 
fact: Romania shows great readiness to get adequate approval 
from the sanctions committee to make humanitarian exports to 
Yugoslavia (food, medicines, raw materials for farm production, 
fuel for schools and hospitals' heating), which helps keeping 
the relations of friendship and a certain amount of trade. 
  "The official Romanian visit by the foreign minister of the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is yet another contribution to 
the continuity of the Yugoslav-Romanian top-level dialogue that 
has not been broken. I would only mention Romanian President 
Ion Iliescu's visit to Yugoslavia and the Bucharest visit by 
Yugoslav Prime Minister Kontic, both paid in the latter half of 
1993. In this respect, as well as for the purpose of finding 
solutions to the Yugoslav crisis, in which Romania has proved 
understanding, flexibility and readiness to help settling the 
crisis and maintaining the stability in the area, the Yugoslav 
minister's visit has been a full success achieved at the fittest 
moment."

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 15/2/1994 -- The National Bank 
of Romania opened on Monday, 14 February, new preferential 
credit lines for exporters, a measure aiming to stabilize the 
national currency leu exchange rate, the daily ADEVARUL says. 
  The economic agents exporting a part of their production 
will 
be offered credit lines totalling some 40 billion lei with an 
interest rate of 70 percent. The preferential financing will 
further rise to several hundreds billion lei while a part of the 
costs would come to be supported by the Eximbank and the state 
budget so that the exporters will have to pay even lower 
interest rates, of 50 or even 40 percent, said the National Bank 
governor Mugur Isarescu. 
  The preferential financing stimulates production, says the 
governor, including the export-oriented production, but the way 
to walk on would not be that of subsidizing the interest but of 
increasing the capital of the efficient economic agents. The 
reason is not hard to find out, reads the daily: Without a 
really positive interest rate it is practically impossible to 
stabilize the exchange rate but the economic agents do not even 
want to hear of an even more expensive credit as their working 
capital is very small therefore forcing them to borrow up to a 
gearing of 80 percent. 
  When the situation will come to the contrary, hurdles will 
lay no more in the way of the trust in leu. Actually, the 
process has started already. Only the Bucharest branch of the 
Romanian Commercial Bank is buying from the population U.S. 
dollars at a daily average of some $100,000. In Ploiesti, 100 
km north-east of Bucharest, people are selling dollars at the 
exchange houses and then cross the street where they buy with 
the fresh lei certificates of deposit issued by banks which are 
already yielding more than holding hard currency and 
anticipating its appreciation. Some days ago, in Bucharest, an 
exchange house sold dollars at an exchange rate of 1,460 lei 
that is below the inter-bank rate of 1480 lei, which is probably 
something that has never happened since 1989. 
  The hunger for lei will surely become more compelling, the 
National Bank governor Mugur Isarescu says, as the National Bank 
"will no longer irrigate the economic field with the pail but 
with the dropper and only where it must."

  [Text] Bratislava, Feb 11 (CTK) -- Slovak Foreign Minister 
Jozef Moravcik said today he did not believe that his 
participation in the creation of an alternative within the 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) should be a reason for 
his resignation as Prime Minister and HZDS Leader Vladimir 
Meciar hinted. 
  "I do not think that I have breached the HZDS principles.... 
One thing is the prime minister's opinion, the HZDS's opinion 
is another thing. We should distinguish between them," Moravcik 
told CTK. 
  He said that further developments depended on tomorrow's 
session of the HZDS leadership, which would decide whether the 
alternative was acceptable within the movement. 
  The Alternative of Political Realism was set up by Moravcik, 
Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac and ten HZDS parliamentarians 
on Thursday [10 February]. 
  "Every democratically functioning organization must respect 
the principle of protection of a minority opinion. Even if we 
do not succeed, this does not mean that we should not be active. 
More clear conclusions will be reached at the (March) HZDS 
assembly," Moravcik said. 
  "The movement must unequivocally target certain strata of 
the 
population, else it will be pushed aside by other political 
parties," Moravcik said. "The middle of the political spectrum 
is the place which corresponds to the HZDS's goals -- 
liberal-social orientation," he added. 
  Moravcik admitted that the alternative, which started to be 
created several weeks ago, had negotiated with the opposition. 
"We did not make any binding statements because we were not 
entitled to. But we must communicate with members of other 
parties, this is nothing abnormal, we need to know the political 
scene." But he did not say with whom the alternative had 
negotiated. 
  Moravcik said he considered a government formed along with 
opposition parties, but without political tops, "an optimum 
solution" to the political crisis before early elections, which 
he said were "necessary," were held. Moravcik said the most 
suitable date for the elections was the spring of 1995.

  [Text] Bratislava Feb 13 (CTK) -- Slovak Deputy Chairman 
[as received] Roman Kovac and Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik 
refused to resign their positions, despite the vote of no 
confidence expressed in them by Movement For a Democratic 
Slovakia (HZDS) leadership on Saturday [12 February]. 
  Both said at a press conference on Sunday [13 February] they 
would wait for Premier Vladimir Meciar, who is also leader of 
the ruling coalition partner HZDS, to ask the Slovak president 
to demand their resignation. 
  Kovac and Moravcik headed the formation of the HZDS 
break-away group Alternative of Political Realism on Thursday 
[10 February]. 
  The two also said Sunday they would remain in the HZDS 
unless 
asked to resign at the party's congress in March. 
  Kovac and Moravcik also denied Meciar's accusations of 
cowardliness and disloyalty. Kovac justified the creation of 
the Alternative as an effort to solve the blocking of laws in 
parliament -- by the stalemate between government and opposition 
powers -- through the formation of a government which would 
include the opposition's participation, but lack personal 
enemies as leaders. 
  One Alternative member, parliamentary Deputy Vladimir Bajan, 
would not comment on how the nine current deputies in the group 
would react to a vote of confidence in Premier Meciar, saying 
they would have to "consider that issue very soon." He did say 
that unconfirmed reports indicated that the parliamentary 
deputies who joined the Alternative of Political Realism were 
under much pressure. 
  Parliament is to meet again on February 16. Government may 
link the expected vote on a privatization law amendment, which 
was responsible for the current deadlock, to the issue of 
confidence in parliamentary deputies also in cabinet. 
Alternative deputies -- who are officially still part of the 
HZDS -- could decide cabinet's fate. 
  Members of the group have said they consider the most 
important outcome of their move to be obtaining the agreement of 
all parties, including HZDS, for the calling of premature 
elections. 
  Moravcik predicted these would take place this year. Kovac 
said the period until any elections could be passed by a broad 
coalition government or even by the current cabinet under the 
condition it agree with the other parties on a date for 
elections and on their advance until then.

  [Text] Bratislava, Feb 11 (CTK) -- In a statement given to 
CTK today, Slovak Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac said that as 
attempts made so far prove that an agreement between the leaders 
of the parliamentary parties and movements was unfeasible, he 
agreed with a pragmatic proposal by the newly emerged 
Alternative of Political Realism. 
  The alternative, established on Thursday [10 February] 
within 
the government coalition major partner, Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), proposes to form a government of a 
broader coalition without top politicians and with the 
participation of independent experts which would operate until 
early elections. 
  Roman Kovac has joined the alternative, along with ten HZDS 
deputies and Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik, also an HZDS 
member. 
  Kovac said he expected the broad coalition government to 
draw 
inspiration from the political programs of the individual 
parties and to try to stabilize the economy and other vitally 
important spheres of society. He called cruel and unjust the 
statement made by Prime Minister and HZDS leader Vladimir Meciar 
that the new coalition's common denominator would be only 
"plundering." 
  Although he is attracted by the ideas embedded in the HZDS 
statutes, he has the right to his own opinion and to defend it, 
Kovac said. He underlined he saw that realization of the appeal 
of the alternative was an acceptable way of deblocking the 
operation of the parliament. He does not find it either 
undemocratic or immoral, he added. 
  "On the contrary, everybody bound to shoulder social and 
political responsibility, should fulfill it according to his 
(her) best conscience," Kovac says in the statement.

  [Text] Bratislava Feb 13 (CTK) -- The opposition Christian 
Democratic Movement (KDH) will support a proposal to hold early 
elections in Slovakia, Chairman Jan Carnogursky told CTK Sunday 
[13 February]. 
  Carnogursky said the party had yet to decide whether it 
would 
suggest June or some later date, though it was leaning towards 
the autumn. Premier Vladimir Meciar earlier this week suggested 
June for premature elections. 
  The KDH chairman refused to comment on whether his group had 
come to an agreement with the opposition Democratic Left Party 
(SDL) on a possible date. 
  Carnogursky said that a motion calling for the premier's 
resignation was unlikely to be put forward during the next 
session of parliament, on Wednesday [16 February], though he 
added that it would certainly be made at some later date. 
  If Meciar were to link a vote on the privatisation law 
amendment, expected in parliament on Wednesday, to the issue of 
confidence in his cabinet, Carnogursky said, the KDH would vote 
against the bill, even though that would mean voting against the 
changes to privatisation legislation, proposed by opposition. 
Carnogursky said he believed that if the premier did not link 
the issues the opposition would get the changes into law. 
  Asked whether he would like to see the premier leave 
government before early elections were held, Carnogursky said: 
"The recalling of government is for us more of a question of 
principles, rather than of strategy." He could not say, 
however, whether the opposition is unified on the issue, though 
discussions between them are to continue non-stop until 
Wednesday's session.

  [Text] Bratislava, Feb 14 (CTK) -- "If the opposition 
believes that the opinions of voters differ from those of 
parliamentary deputies, early elections could take place," Jozef 
Prokes, Slovak deputy premier and honorary chairman of the 
government coalition's junior partner, the Slovak National Party 
(SNS), told journalists today. 
  Prokes said that the SNS fully agreed with the view of its 
coalition partner, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
(HZDS), that the elections should be called as early as possible. 
  He said that the vote of no confidence in Deputy Premier 
Roman Kovac and Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik by the HZDS 
Board on Saturday [12 February] was a natural result of the 
developments within the HZDS. 
  Roman Kovac and Moravcik [are] the initiators of a new 
faction within the HZDS aimed at creating a broad coalition 
government. 
  Prokes said that the SNS and the HZDS had not yet discussed 
possible successors to Kovac and Moravcik if they are dismissed. 
It is premature to evaluate the question of whether the post of 
foreign minister will be offered to himself, Prokes stated. 
  Reacting to the proposals made by the newly established HZDS 
faction, the Alternative of Political Realism, Prokes said that 
the country had already experienced a National Front in the 
communist period. If such steps are taken now, it would be the 
end of pluralism, he added. 
  Prokes assured that the eight-member SNS group of deputies 
would support the amendment to the large privatization law, 
which is to be the first point on the agenda of the next meeting 
within the current parliamentary session, scheduled for 
Wednesday [16 February].

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Yugoslav Army Spokesman Colonel </F>
Ljubodrag Stojadinovic by Robert Block in Belgrade on 10 
February] 
  [Text] As British, French and American warplanes stand by 
for what could be the first military engagement in Nato's 
history, the army of rump Yugoslavia watches the gathering 
maelstrom with apprehension. But barring high civilian casualty 
rates from Nato bombs, the main Serbian army in the area appears 
prepared to let Bosnian Serbs face Western air strikes alone. 
  "We believe that Serbs in the Republika Srpska (the Bosnian 
Serbs' self-proclaimed statelet) have enough wisdom and strength 
to protect their weapons from air strikes and to cause damage to 
attacking planes in the event of any bombardment of their 
artillery positions," Colonel Ljubodrag Stojadinovic, the 
Yugoslav army's spokesman, said in a rare interview yesterday. 
  The possiblity of Western intervention bringing the 
80,000-strong Yugoslav army (VJ) of Serbia and Montenegro to the 
rescue of Serbs in Bosnia has been an important consideration of 
Nato military planners. Despite repeated denials, the rump 
Yugoslav federation is widely believed to be giving direct 
support to the Serbian nationalists fighting the mainly Muslim 
government in Bosnia. It was in an effort to pressurise 
Belgrade into halting such assistance that the UN imposed 
economic sanctions on Yugoslavia in 1992. 
  The open involvement of the well-equipped VJ in the fight 
against United Nations servicemen in Nato aircraft would be a 
first step towards widening the Bosnia war and turning Nato's 
attempt to lift the siege of Sarajevo into the opening of a 
bloody new war. But according to Colonel Stojadinovic, Nato air 
strikes on Serbian artillery positions around Sarajevo do not by 
themselves appear to be a sufficient cause for the VJ to join 
the fray. 
  "However," he added, "if it seems that the air strikes are 
aimed against Serbs (civilians), then this would be viewed as 
something completely different... It would be viewed as 
internationally legalised genocide. The result would be 
uncontrollable warfare." 
  One problem facing Nato planes in an attack would be that 
many of the 100 or so big guns that enforce the Serbian siege of 
Sarajevo are perilously close to both Serbian and Muslim 
residential areas. The positioning of weapons near hospitals and 
public buildings is a tactic employed by all sides in Bosnia. 
Bombing raids would have to be precise in order to keep 
civilian casualties, euphemistically known as "collateral 
damage", to a minimum. 
  When asked how the VJ would distinguish between "acceptable 
collateral damage" and "genocide", Colonel Stojadinovic replied: 
"Just as the attacker has a right to evaluate the criteria for 
target selection, those under attack have a right to determine 
if the concept of air strikes has exceeded acceptable 
boundaries... I am certain that in any bombing raids around 
Sarajevo, the least number of casualties would be among 
soldiers." 
  Command of the VJ is vested in a body known as the Supreme 
Defence Council, comprising the presidents of Serbia and 
Montenegro and the armed forces' chief of staff. In practice 
the real power is with President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, 
who has overseen the VJ's transformation from a multi-ethnic, 
Communist-led fighting force, to an essentially Serbian 
professional army. The course the VJ steers will depend solely 
on the political ambitions of Mr Milosevic. "The final military 
position, of course, is dependent on politicians and state 
policy," Colonel Stojadinovic said. 
  There was an element of bravado and rhetoric in what the 
colonel said, but the impression he gave was one of concern: "As 
you can clearly see, I am extremely worried." 
  He compared the situation in the Balkans today to 1914, 
when, 
following the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand by a young 
Serb in Sarajevo, Austria attempted to stem Serbian aspirations 
towards a pan-Slav state and issued Serbia with an 
uncompromising ultimatum. The result was the First World War. 
  "The only difference between then and now is that the Serbs 
are not responsible for that massacre in the Sarajevo market. 
That's what makes Nato's ultimatum (for Serbs to withdraw their 
artillery from around Sarajevo) ridiculous."

  [Text] Tirana, February 13 (ATA) -- The rump Yugoslavia's 
authorities refused to give visas for Kosova to a delegation for 
human rights of the Helsinki Federation, the Kosova Information 
Centre reported. The delegation intended to observe what has 
happened to the Albanians returned from Austria, Scandinavian 
countries and Germany. 
  Concerning the refusal of the Serbian authorities to go to 
Kosova, Ms. Christine von Kohl told BBC: "This time we received 
no answer." She explained how she had personally talked with 
the official in charge of so-called Yugoslav Embassy in Vienna. 
  Ms. von Kohl said one of the reasons for refusing the visas 
might be the fact that the Belgrade's authorities want to show 
they do not observe the CSCE norms as it recently happened with 
the Amnesty International.

  [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 16 (AFP) -- NATO and the United 
Nations see eye to eye on how to control heavy weapons of 
Bosnian Serbs in the Sarajevo area as part of a NATO ultimatum 
to end the siege of the Bosnian capital or face air strikes, a 
UN spokesman said Tuesday. "Coordination meetings between NATO 
and the UN have sorted out all points," Peter MacFarlane, a 
spokesman for the United Nations Protection Force [UNPROFOR], 
told a press conference. 
  His comments contrasted with reports from Brussels that NATO 
was becoming increasingly critical of apparently inadequate UN 
plans to monitor the Serb artillery around the city. 
  "On the broader pinciples I can say that NATO and the UN are 
very much of one mind," MacFarlane. He noted that control 
involved "monitoring, supervision by UNPROFOR personnel, linked 
to the question of where weapons are located at the end" of the 
February 21 NATO deadline for the belligerents to withdraw their 
heavy weapons or placed them under UN control. 
  MacFarlane said the issue was being discussed with both the 
Bosnian Serbs and the mainly Moslem Bosnian Army. 
  He added that despite the cancelation of Tuesday's meeting 
of 
top military officials at Sarajevo airport after the Bosnian 
Army comander in chief did not show up, the UNPROFOR commander 
for Bosnia, General Michael Rose, "is at this stage fairly happy 
with the way things are going." 
  Earlier in Brussels NATO sources said the head of the 
Atlantic alliance's forces in Europe was to meet with the UN 
special envoy to former Yugoslavia this week to discuss 
differences over enforcement of the NATO ultimatum. 
  NATO General George Joulwan was to meet with Yasushi Akashi 
in Zagreb at a time yet to be decided, to raise problems of 
coordination between the two bodies, a NATO military source said. 
  Separate NATO sources said UNPROFOR plans to have monitors 
check on Serb artillery surrendered to UN troops in Serb 
barracks under a ceasefire accord implemented Thursday did not 
amount to proper control. One anonymous source said: "That's 
not a proper control. The control has to be strong enough to 
stop the weapons being used." 
  The Serbs have placed 33 artillery pieces under UN 
monitoring 
within Serb barracks at Lukavica and Mokro, while the 
mainly-Moslem government forces have handed over 10 mortars to 
Ukrainian UN forces in Sarajevo. 
  Bosnian Serb leaders Tuesday rejected demands to withdraw 
all 
their heavy arms from around Sarajevo. Bosnian Serb military 
commander General Radko Mladic told the Yugoslav TANJUG news 
agency that his weapons would stay put to protect Serbs against 
"fanatical Moslem units." 
  But Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said that he was 
prepared to order regrouping of "part" of his heavy artillery 
"in order to facilitate monitoring" by UN peacekeepers.

  [Text] Brussels, Feb 16 (AFP) -- The North Atlantic Treaty 
Organisation will not extend its deadline of February 21 for 
besieging Serbs to withdraw their artillery from around Sarajevo 
or face air strikes, a spokesman said Wednesday. 
  He was speaking after a meeting of the ambassadors to NATO 
of 
the 16 member countries, who fixed the deadline on February 9 
after being asked by the United Nations to consider airstrikes 
following the massacre of 68 people by a mortar bomb in a 
Sarajevo market. The Bosnian Serbs have denied firing the bomb 
and a UN commission of inquiry said in Zagreb Wednesday it had 
failed to determine its origin. 
  In Sarajevo the handing over of heavy weapons to UN control 
by both sides, an alternative to their withdrawal, has been 
proceeding at a snail's pace.

<F P=106> [Martin Leka report: "Safet Zhulali Orders the Mass </F>
Disarmament of the Albanian Army"] 
  [Text] [Page one carries two facsimile passages with the 
subhead "Extract from the order of Defense Minister Safet 
Zhulali": 
  [The first facsimile passage reads: "I order: 1. Personal 
weapons such as knives, pistols, guns, or automatic rifles given 
to officers, noncommissioned officers, and civilians employed by 
the army will be deposited in the armories of bases, units, or 
the relevant institutions by 15 January 1994." 
  [The second facsimile passage carries the signature "Defense 
Minister Safet Zhulali"] 
<H5>  Mass Disarmament of the Albanian Army </H5>
  This, then, is the order of Defense Minister Safet Zhulali 
issued on 8 January this year, to be carried out by 15 January. 
One would perhaps envy the "haste" of such an order if it were 
to arm rather than to disarm officers, noncommissioned officers, 
and civilians employed by the army. Now all officers, except 
for those not covered by Zhulali's order to "lose weight," will 
be without their personal weapons, whether knives, pistols, 
guns, or automatic rifles. According to the above-mentioned 
order, this is in order to regulate the administration of 
personal weapons and to prevent unusual events (!)... 
  The reasoning behind the disarmament of officers described 
in 
the order lies open to many doubts. First, we do not think the 
regular administration of personal weapons means their removal. 
I think that there are plenty of other measures that might 
enforce discipline in this area. In this specific case, the 
word "regulate" has assumed an absolute meaning, excluding all 
other forms of "regulation." Second, even though there have 
been cases in which unusual events have taken place, those 
involving officers seem to us to have been minimal and 
insignificant compared with those today involving individuals 
carrying weapons whether with or without licences. Such an 
explanation holds good least of all for officers, who are among 
the people most trusted by those who turn their eyes to every 
citizens whenever the words "enemy" or "war" are uttered. 
  For reasons of this kind, there has been a great deal of 
speculation about the disarmament of these servicemen, as many 
servicemen affected by the order have recently told us. 
  This speculation includes a possible drastic reduction in 
the 
staff of military units, starting from the ministry itself, with 
the aim of preventing any incident caused by jittery servicemen 
who do not properly understand the reform in the army. Others 
explain the order with reference to the new generals' "fear" of 
the "old soldiers" (!). Others ironically explain that Albania 
has now run out of enemies, etc., etc.... 
  Only the officers, noncommissioned officers, radio 
operators, 
and drivers attached to the main army chiefs are excluded from 
this order, and have the right to carry weapons. 
  Now the officers' weapons have been taken away. In short, a 
person can now seize an officer's cap at whim and run off with 
it, and the officre will pursue him on foot?! Before seizing 
the cap, you must only put your trust in the officer's running 
ability or the Lord Almightly. How far can one trifle with our 
respected officers today? 
  At a time when such a thing is happening, something which to 
our minds is entirely unacceptable, the fact is that a "mafia" 
that principally uses weapons to achieve its dark aims is ever 
more clearly emerging. These mafiosi will now be further 
emboldened. One weapon less in the hands of officers means one 
more for criminals, because from now on the latter will now be 
able to step out in front of the finest officer, say "Hands up," 
search him, and rob him, taking even his briefcase of documents, 
and finally ordering the officer to stand "to attention" until 
the armed criminal has quietly departed toward an "unknown 
destination".

<F P=106> [Nikolle Ivesi article: "Gjader Military Airport May Become </F>
a Base for CIA Spy Planes"] 
  [Text] It has now been decided. Two CIA spy planes, a 
radio station, and 12 experts will shortly arrive in Albania. 
We make it clear that this equipment and these experts belong 
to the U.S. secret service and not the U.S. Defense Department. 
  We have nothing against this idea of Defense Minister Safet 
Zhulali, or maybe of Berisha, except that the fact that the U.S. 
secret service is poking its nose in here, and not, as would be 
more acceptable, the U.S. Defense Department or NATO, makes one 
suspect the purpose of this "operation." It is the same as if 
the Albanian National Intelligence Service, i.e. Gazidede, were 
to establish such a base in the United States. Even more 
disturbing is the fact that Italian Defense Minister Fabio Fabri 
himself opposed the establishment of this base at an Italian 
airport, because it would pose serious problems for Italy if the 
spread of the war in Bosnia were to lead Serbia to respond with 
missiles against the site where CIA-commanded GNAT spy planes 
were based. Italy, although a NATO member, therefore did not 
agree, while we did immediately. The Albanian authorities have 
made no statement about the siting of these planes. The problem 
of their deployment is worrying, because, as foreign news 
agencies report, these spy planes, if they explode in the air or 
have defects, are very dangerous for the civilian population of 
the areas where they are based. If the Defense Ministry is soon 
going to position them, as is thought, at the airport at Gjader 
near Lezhe, will it ask the local government representatives of 
these areas, when these aircraft are known to be dangerous to 
the lives of local inhabitants?!

  [Text] Zhirinovskiy's bad behavior in Budapest has led to a 
memorandum. Istvan Kulcsar reports from the foreign affairs 
spokesman's briefing, which was held today. 
  [Kulcsar] The spokesman outlined the program of Prime 
Minister Peter Boross's visit to Paris at the end of this month. 
He will meet President Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur, and will take part in a working lunch with 
Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. Answering a question, the 
spokesman said that the Hungarian Government continues to 
appreciate the Balladur plan. 
  Then Russian topics were on the news briefing's agenda. 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev will hold talks in 
Budapest from 21 to 22 February. He will be received by the 
Hungarian president and the prime minister as well. The 
expected topics of his talks with [Foreign Minister] Geza 
Jeszenszky are, in addition to bilateral ties, the Yugoslav 
crisis, the European situation, and Hungary's integration into 
Europe. 
  At the beginning of March the head of the Russian Church, 
Patriarch Aleksii II, will visit Hungary. 
  Janos Herman outlined the memorandum, which was addressed by 
the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Russian embassy 
in Budapest in connection with the scandal of Zhirinovskiy, who 
travelled through Budapest. It has come to the Foreign 
Ministry's notice that on 3 February 1994 Mr. Vladimir Volkovich 
Zhirinovskiy, a member of the Russian State Duma, during his 
private journey through Ferihegy Airport in Budapest, violated 
basic behavioral norms by publicly making insulting remarks 
about the Hungarian Republic and the airport staff on duty who 
were acting in accordance with regulations on passenger traffic, 
the memorandum reads. The Hungarian Republic's Foreign Ministry 
considers it unacceptable that a responsible politician and 
parliamentary deputy should express his opinion about Hungary 
and our fellow citizens in such a disreputable [meltatlan] 
manner and style. This was stated in the Foreign Ministry's 
memorandum addressed to the Russian embassy, which was outlined 
by the foreign affairs spokesman at his news briefing this 
morning.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman Gyula </F>
Horn by Gregor Mayer; place and date not given: "A Call for the 
Guiding Hand of the State"] 
  [Excerpt] [Mayer] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy recently said 
that Hungary is a "weak, poor country" and that Eastern Central 
Europe will "unite in an alliance under Slovakia's leadership." 
Should Hungary fear Russia again? 
  [Horn] One should not take Mr. Zhirinovskiy's statements 
seriously. Of course, one must not ignore him either because 
this nationalist-imperialist direction that he represents is a 
certain challenge. However, I do not fear that Russia will 
again turn Eastern Central Europe into its sphere of influence. 
  [Mayer] Why not? 
  [Horn] Russia neither has a reason nor the power. It is 
struggling with its own internal difficulties. It is not easy 
to hold Russia together. 
  [Mayer] Moscow's aspirations to push through some kind of 
Monroe Doctrine for the territory within the ex-Soviet borders 
do not alarm you either? 
  [Horn] Hungary and the other countries of Eastern Central 
Europe never belonged to Moscow. This is completely different 
from Georgia or the other ex-USSR republics. 
  [Mayer] However, you proposed as early as in 1990 that 
Hungary should strive for its admission to NATO. 
  [Horn] At that time, I proposed that close relations with 
NATO be developed. Even though this may have been differently 
interpreted, I meant political, not military cooperation. 
  [Mayer] At any rate, at that time, when the new democratic 
parties still talked of neutrality, you were a silent caller in 
Hungary. Are you disappointed today at NATO's hesitation to 
admit the Eastern European candidates as members? 
  [Horn] The "Partnership for Peace" program is a clever idea 
because it holds out the prospect of the development of 
cooperation to the East Europeans and does not commit NATO to 
anything in the question of admission. 
  [Mayer] Poland has, therefore, reacted with frustration. 
  [Horn] I am rather disappointed, because I do not see a 
guarantee that NATO would do something against a possible crisis 
in this region or how this would be done. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Lajos Fur by Peter Vajda; </F>
place and date not given: "Lajos Fur: The MDF Has Come Around"] 
  [Excerpts] It can be seen as virtually settled that Lajos 
Fur will be the official nominee for party chairmanship in the 
Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] and his election can be seen as 
certain. He will probably keep his office of defense minister 
even when he is party chairman. Our correspondent interviewed 
him on issues he will be responsible for in his two capacities. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Vajda] The situation is different from that before 1990 and 
you are probably thinking in terms of some kind of coalition. I 
assume that various versions emerge. [MDF Deputy Chairman 
Sandor] Lezsak, whose views are considered to be close to yours 
in many respects, once said that he cannot imagine any kind of 
cooperation with the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], the 
main reason being its attitude toward the churches. Do you 
share Lezsak's view on this? 
  [Fur] More or less I do, although he said this rather a long 
time ago, perhaps two months ago.... The Fidesz appears to be 
undergoing a big process of change. It is impossible to know 
its direction because all changes, if the Fidesz's mentality 
will indeed change, are difficult to accomplish. It is 
difficult to give up the habits. It is a fact that they have 
lately been proclaiming that the Fidesz is a center party and 
wishes to remain so, it has a national commitment, it fully 
represents the cause of the Hungarian national minorities, and 
it wishes to remain free of all extremisms. This, I believe, 
means distancing from the extreme right as well as the extreme 
left or left-wing parties. In my view, it would not now be 
possible to say that we will not enter into any kind of 
political dialogue with the Fidesz under any circumstances, but 
we cannot say that let us embrace each other, either. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Vajda] Let us turn to the Army. To be frank: Is it able 
to function? 
  [Fur] The current situation is indeed very difficult but 
this is not a result of the past two to three years. The last 
big purchases were done in the first half of the 1970's. A 
little was also done in the early 1980's but nothing at all has 
been bought in the past 10 to 15 years. This is not to mention 
the structures, barracks, buildings, and dwellings. The last 
big constructions took place in the 1950's and 1960's, nothing 
has been done since then. Not even maintenance. It is not in 
these two to three years that everything is trying to fall on 
top of us, this is the result of a long process. Everyone is 
aware of the country's economic situation. Whenever it was 
possible, I fought tooth and nail for increasing our budget. It 
would hardly have been possible to achieve more than what we 
actually received, and even this is reduced by various taxes and 
levies. I know that for a lieutenant who has basic problems of 
survival -- whether he can buy meat for himself or he can pay 
rent or heating -- this is poor comfort but this is how much we 
have. If the government accepts the proposal on the legal 
status of soldiers and it is also passed by Parliament then the 
pay of regular soldiers can significantly be increased possibly 
this year, but certainly from 1995. [passage omitted] 
  [Vajda] Are you, the first team of the change of the regime, 
a little bitter because your hopes of receiving Western help -- 
for example, in developing the Army, among other things -- have 
not really materialized? During talks with your Western 
colleagues, do you express that a certain amount of 
disappointment exists because of this? 
  [Fur] I certainly voice these feelings. I partly express 
our disappointment because we did not manage to make any 
progress, or at least we did not really manage to start 
including modern technology in the Hungarian Army. We also 
express our feeling of regret because this region has not 
received the necessary guarantees we would have liked in the 
area of security. 
  [Vajda] You are obviously also thinking of the case when we 
allowed certain aerial activity in our airspace, and [former] 
Prime Minister Antall had asked for definite guarantees -- and 
this was leaked in the Western press -- but we did not receive 
these, either. 
  [Fur] AWACS planes circled above us at that time. As for 
guarantees, we received verbal promise that any kind of harm to 
Hungary would at the same time mean a challenge for the West and 
it would not leave it at that. However, it is difficult to know 
what this actually means in practice. This kind of 
disappointment exists in Hungary and in other countries of the 
region. On the other hand, it will still be possible to make 
progress through the new partnership, if in nothing else then in 
establishing real military links because, up to now, we have 
only had visits.... 
  [Vajda] Nevertheless, this is a little less than what you 
wanted. 
  [Fur] It is less because obviously we wanted more, but this 
is what we can have and we have to make do with this. More 
precisely, we will have to be able to make good use of this 
because certain possibilities do exist here. For example, we 
might be able to start bringing in small amounts of new 
technology mainly through setting up and operating the 
peacekeeping forces. 
<H5>  Normalization With Serbia </H5>
  [Vajda] What do we expect from the Russians? What will 
happen to the remainder of their debt? 
  [Fuir] As a minister, I would be happiest if we managed to 
settle this remaining $800 million through some military 
purchases, but other viewpoints also exist. We do not yet fully 
know the Russian views, either. In Russia, various guesses and 
ideas emerge from time to time but I do not know if they all 
have a realistic basis. 
  [Vajda] A military expert actually wrote that the 
leadership of the Defense Ministry, including the minister, are 
in love with the E300 defense system. Have we really fully 
committed ourselves to this system? 
  [Fur] This is not a matter of love, this is a forced 
situation. 
  [Vajda] However, do we need this system? 
  [Fur] We would need it. Our sky still has a hole in it. 
This system would be the best one to fill this hole. 
  [Vajda] The reconstruction of the MiG-21s: Have you managed 
to achieve anything with the Israelis who, as it is known, deal 
with modernizing the airplanes? Is there a realistic hope or 
are we going to throw out these airplanes? 
  [Fur] No, we do not want to discard them. This also depends 
on the budget and on what methods the Israelis happen to find to 
modernize them. We have looked at a few bases in Israel where 
this is done. They would be ready to modernize these airplanes; 
they are also conducting talks with other countries on similar 
issues. The question is whether we can assign adequate funds to 
this and whether they can give us favorable offers on future 
payments or other financial methods. A number of solutions can 
exist. 
  [Vajda] You were a champion of developing military links 
with our neighbors, namely Slovakia and Romania. Relations with 
the Serbs have come on the agenda in Hungarian foreign policy. 
Can we expect some kind of settlement of Hungarian-Serbian 
relations? 
  [Fur] We have had links and still have them, mainly in the 
areas of aerial control and air defense. 
  [Vajda] All the public can see from this is that the Serbian 
military attache is called in and we protest against the aerial 
violations over Szeged. 
  [Fur] We also have other contacts and we have had higher 
level meetings in the past period where these cases of border 
violations, more precisely, the ways to prevent them, were 
discussed. Recently, since the fighting moved over to Bosnia, 
we have not really had any such events. Our military contacts 
have not been severed although, as it is known, the Serbian, or 
little Yugoslavian, higher level military leadership has been 
replaced three times in the past two to three years. The 1990 
leadership was replaced in 1992, then these were also replaced 
later including the generals, the leadership, and everything. 
  [Vajda] This also happens in Hungary below the level of 
minister.... 
  [Fur] Not to this extent.... In our case, this is a natural 
turnover while there, I believe, an artificial replacement took 
place. The main point is that we do have contacts, and I trust 
that, if we manage to settle relations on a political level -- 
as [Foreign Minister] Geza Jeszenszky's recent visit to Belgrade 
indicated this, having confidence in advance -- then higher 
level or top level meetings can also take place. 
  [Vajda] Would you accept an invitation to Belgrade? 
  [Fur] I certainly would if the conditions were right.

<F P=106> [Interview with State Secretary Geza Entz, chairman of the </F>
Office for Hungarians Living Beyond the Borders, by Jozsef 
Botlik; place and date not given: "We Cannot Count on a 
Spectacular Breakthrough"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Botlik] Prime Minister Peter 
Boross received representatives of ethnic Hungarians living 
abroad on 11 February. How did the Office for Hungarians Living 
Beyond the Borders participate in the preparation of this 
meeting and what made this meeting timely? 
  [Entz] Given the nature of our office, it is our primary 
task to keep contact with the organizations of ethnic Hungarians 
abroad. Regular contacts are held with the heads of 
organizations of ethnic Hungarians abroad at a prime ministerial 
level and at the level of other government officials, and this 
means the implementation of the constitutional obligation of 
this cabinet. The fact that the mother country and the 
Hungarian Government deal with the issue of Hungarians living in 
the neighboring countries has a stabilizing effect in the 
region. If we did not do this and failed to take up this 
responsibility, the deterioration in their situation would carry 
the danger of an advance of extremist forces, and this would 
definitely destabilize the situation. 
  With the current meeting, the old-new government also wants 
to express our political continuity, a continuity that cannot be 
broken even by the upcoming elections, given the basic national 
interests involved. [passage omitted] 
  [Botlik] Is there any division of labor between your office 
and the Foreign Ministry? 
  [Entz] It is the task of the Foreign Ministry to keep 
contacts with governments; our task is to cooperate with various 
organizations of the civil society, namely with the Hungarian 
communities living in the neighboring countries and with 
Hungarian organizations and churches all over the world. We 
regard these communities as partners in solving the 
international and domestic administrative tasks that affect 
them. It would be a mistake to treat the issue of ethnic 
Hungarians abroad as a foreign affairs issue only, because it 
practically affects the activity of every ministry in one way or 
another. Naturally, we offer partnership to the neighboring 
countries in these matters too, and there are countries that 
accept this offer and there are countries that do not yet accept 
it. Obviously, the decisions made in the various government 
spheres must form a uniform whole. It is our main task to 
coordinate these various activities. [passage omitted] 
  [Botlik] Where did you start from in analyzing the situation 
of Hungarians living abroad? 
  [Entz] We cannot disregard the fact that, with the Trianon 
Treaty of 1920, some 3.5 million Hungarians found themselves 
citizens of neighboring countries. These Hungarian communities 
are native inhabitants and have been playing an important role 
in shaping the civilization of those areas for centuries. If 
the real needs of this Hungarian minority are disregarded and if 
the regime and logic of these states aim at eliminating these 
communities by various milder or tougher forms of ethnic 
cleansing, up to genocide, then one must declare that this is 
the real source of the tension. It is also the fundamental 
interest of the other nations that have been living together 
with the Hungarians for centuries to treat the issue of the 
Hungarian minority positively, because only this approach can 
create the conditions for a fruitful cooperation and, in a wider 
sense, the bases of equal European integration. [passage omitted] 
  [Botlik] Could a dialogue emerge between the government and 
the Hungarian political parties in Slovakia? 
  [Entz] There are no realistic chances for such a thing in 
the current situation; however, there will surely be such a 
development in the long run. The Slovaks and Hungarians are 
interdependent, and this must emerge in Slovak politics sooner 
or later. We would like to see such a development as soon as 
possible. 
  [Botlik] With what neighboring countries are there 
possibilities of strengthening bilateral relations and improving 
the situation of the Hungarian minority? 
  [Entz] We can hardly count on a spectacular breakthrough in 
this respect. The current situation is the result of decisions 
made in this century, decisions opposing the interests of 
nations living in this region. It is characteristic of the 
situation that, in our region, nations that came out as victors 
in wars are now in the worst situation. This is definitely not 
good for Hungary. The fact that most of our neighbors are more 
unstable and their economy is also more unstable than ours 
hinders the assertion of the nice principle of making the 
borders traversable. This is not a matter of subjective 
decision; this requires the implementation of considerable 
market economy and social conditions. If these conditions are 
not there, the borders will continue to be difficult to traverse. 
  [Botlik] The fate of the Carpathian Euroregion clearly shows 
the problems.... 
  [Entz] Yes, we can have no illusion regarding the complete 
openness of borders in the near future. We do not have to fear 
a Balkans-type conflict leading to armed violence in the region, 
but we do have to consider an economic stagnation, something 
that represents a constant crisis. This is mainly the reason 
for difficulties in improving relations. On the other hand, the 
extremist manifestations of national state ideas play a role in 
the region, and this represents a serious political obstacle. 
  [Botlik] In view of your recent talks with the heads of 
Hungarian organizations abroad, what chances do you see in 
improving the situation of ethnic Hungarians abroad? 
  [Entz] For example, there is not a large-scale immigration 
of Hungarians from Slovakia into Hungary, or brain-drain, or any 
other negative process. However, the same type of problems are 
of worrying size in Romania. Emigration from the Subcarpathian 
region has also become considerable lately. Unfortunately, some 
countries continue their traditional policy toward national 
minorities. Serbia regards Hungary as a long-term strategic 
partner, and this could work in peacetime. The need for 
Slovakia and Hungary to cooperate is obvious. 
  [Botlik] The Hungarian public is mainly focusing its 
attention on our eastern neighbor and Transylvania.... 
  [Entz] Unfortunately, in the case of Romania, this need for 
cooperation is not so obvious. For example, in the eighties, 
when the CEMA was "flourishing" and cooperation was so 
"excellent" that some people are sorry for the collapse, our 
eastern neighbor occupied 16th place among Hungary's trade 
partners, and the same position is valid today. Lasting 
political trends can be clearly seen from economic indicators. 
In this situation, when economic contacts are so insignificant, 
every element of interstate relations easily becomes political, 
especially if there are organizational frameworks for this. 
This is why hysterical waves play an important role 
occasionally in Hungarian-Romanian relations, just like in the 
past. As long as there is no change in such basic issues, we 
cannot expect much better things from the future either.

  [Text] Today, on the second day of his visit to Romania, 
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and the Croatian delegation 
visited the Romanian parliament. They met the president of the 
House of Deputies, Adrian Nastase, and President of the Senate 
Oliviou Gherman. President Tudjman visited the House of 
Representatives, which was in session. He was welcomed with 
rapturous applause. Nastase said that all matters of political 
importance were discussed in the parliament comprising 14 
parties and 460 representatives. He said that the main issues 
being discussed by the representatives were the democratic 
development of Romania and economic reforms. [words indistinct] 
the right way, he stressed, and added that all political 
disputes are resolved by political means in parliament and that 
there is a general consensus among the parties on foreign policy. 
  In his temporary residence in Bucharest, President Tudjman 
received Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu. Discussing 
the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, they agreed that the 
international community had reacted too late and that there is 
disunity regarding solutions between the United Nations, 
European union, and the United States. The Croatian president 
and the Romanian prime minister also discussed economic 
relations between the two countries. Tonight the Croatian 
president will meet representatives of the Croatian community in 
Romania at the Croatian embassy in Bucharest.

  [Text] We have received the following communique by fax 
from the Ministry of National Defense: 
  In connection with certain allegations taken from the German 
weekly DER SPIEGEL by the newspaper SLOBODNA SLOVO of 7 February 
1994 -- according to which two ultralight planes and eight [as 
heard] Mi-8 transport helicopters would have crossed Romanian 
territory to help the Muslim troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- the 
Press Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense states: 
  These allegations have no real foundation. No foreign planes 
flew over the Romanian territory to bring supplies to any side 
involved in the ongoing conflict in former Yugoslavia. Romania 
strictly observes the embargo imposed by the United Nations. 
The news circulated by these publications is probably part of a 
scenario to brainwash public, the communique reads.

  [Text] Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu has received a 
group of dignitaries from the Republic of Moldova led by First 
Deputy Prime Minister Nicolae Andronati at Victoria Palace 
today. The meeting was attended by Romanian Ambassador in 
Chisinau Marian Enache. 
  During the meeting the two sides briefed each other on the 
development of the transition process in the two countries and 
on the specific difficulties of the current period, which are 
being complicated by the energy crisis. The two sides also 
discussed tangible problems pertaining to bilateral relations by 
emphasizing the importance of economic integration both for 
Moldova and Romania. 
  It was stressed that the documents that have been signed and 
those that are to be signed in the coming days will represent 
genuine support for trading companies in the two countries, as 
well as for expanding direct relations between economic units on 
the two banks of the Prut River. 
  Within this context, the two sides noted that relations 
between companies and even between ministries have exceeded 
cooperation at the summit. They agreed that more frequent 
contacts are necessary between the heads of the two governments. 
  Vacaroiu proposed that unsolved problems in economic 
cooperation be checked and examined to identify the best 
solutions swiftly. He assured the high-ranking guests that the 
Romanian Government will continue to support -- economically and 
financially, including through the 1994 budget -- the economy of 
the Republic of Moldova, as well as the economic integration 
process, a press release received from a government spokesman 
points out.

<F P=106> [Ion Cristoiu commentary: "Mircea Snegur Awakens Us to </F>
Reality"] 
  [Text] At the end of last week, the attention of Romanian 
press and political circles focused on the shocking statements 
made by two of the leaders of the Republic of Moldova regarding 
relations with Romania. The contents of their statements are 
already known from the press. During a [5 February] meeting 
organized within the current electoral campaign by the Civic 
Alliance, an organization that supports, both in its political 
and cultural activity, the president of the Republic of Moldova, 
Mircea Snegur, stated that one should distinguish between what 
is Romanian and what is Moldovan. Elaborating further on that 
idea, the leader of the Democratic Agrarian Party of Moldova 
[PDAM], Dumitru Motpan, at an electoral meeting held in the 
locality of Cantemir, pleaded against the Republic of Moldova's 
union with Romania, suggesting that the union should rather be 
accomplished merely with a part of Romania, namely with Moldavia 
[Romania's north-eastern region, bordering the Republic of 
Moldova]. The two statements came as a surprise from many 
points of view. First, because since that republic has gained 
its independence, in August 1991, this has been the first time 
that the Chisinau leaders have categorically rejected 
unification with Romania. However, one cannot say that before 
there have been no signs warning of the anti-unification stance 
of these politicians, and, generally, the representatives of the 
state power in the Republic of Moldova. Those signals have 
actually intensified lately, parallel to the increasing pressure 
from Moscow, intended to resurrect the former USSR. Although 
the substantial economic, cultural, and moral support granted by 
Romania was entirely accepted, the Chisinau authorities were 
quite prudent, not to say awkward, in their public statements 
made when receiving the gifts. One could clearly see that both 
the president and the government were trying hard not to 
irritate Moscow by advocating too extensive ties with Romania. 
Even the "brotherly" meetings of Snegur and [Romanian 
President] Iliescu were treated with a certain distance by the 
Chisinau leaders. While the pro-presidential Romanian press 
commented with lyrical enthusiasm, offering full-page reports 
about the two presidents' bearhugs and kisses, the Chisinau 
press and television viewed the same events with much more 
coolness. This is how, lately, a kind of feeling was created, a 
quite embarrassing one for us, Romanians, that the open 
acknowledgment of our brotherhood is inconvenient for the people 
across the Prut River, and that the process of tightening 
Romania's ties with the Republic of Moldova is progressing owing 
to our insistence, rather than that of the Chisinau leaders. 
Nevertheless, this has been the first time that the union with 
Romania has been rejected publicly in such an imperative tone, 
and, especially, betraying an inexplicable anger against the 
Romanians living in Romania. 
  Second, Snegur's and Motpan's statements are also shocking 
because they reproduce, almost word by word, the Soviet stance 
regarding the relations between Moldova and Romania. The thesis 
according to which a Moldovan nation does exist, and that, 
besides the citizens of the Republic of Moldova, it also 
comprises the people that live in Romania's Moldavia, was one of 
the theses that were most insisted upon by Moscow during the 
time of the Ceausescu regime. Moscow used it as an instrument 
not merely to discourage any tendencies favoring the 
unification, but also as means to exert political and military 
pressure [upon Romania]. Both the way in which it was 
formulated and its logic indicated that the official Soviet 
propaganda was using that thesis as a reason justifying a 
possible military attack against rebel Romania. 
  Bucharest made great fuss about the statements of the two 
Moldovan leaders. Political leaders representing all colors 
expressed their indignation and engaged in fiery polemics with 
Snegur and Motpan. They referred to [shared] culture and 
history and they tried to find the real reasons behind the 
statements of the Moldovan politicians. According to certain 
opinions, we have to deal with two traitors who betrayed the 
Romanian cause and sold their souls to Moscow from the very 
beginning. According to others, the authors of the statements 
are heroes who are willing to play this anti-unification role 
precisely to safeguard the chances of unification, assuming the 
risk of being considered traitors. As with so many other 
complicated cases in history, we will probably learn much later 
about the real reasons behind the statements made in the 
Republic of Moldova. Until then, however, one thing remains 
certain. The statements in question were made under the 
circumstances of the electoral campaign in progress in the 
Republic of Moldova. Unfortunately, that is a detail that 
passed totally unnoticed by Romanian journalists and 
politicians. Had they discovered its importance, the reasons 
why Snegur and Motpan declared that they reject unification 
would have faded to a fact of secondary importance. Because 
what matters primarily is the fact that the statements were made 
for electoral purposes. As is well known, all electoral 
campaigns in political systems that allow for free ballots are 
dominated by the candidates' efforts to anticipate the frame of 
mind of the electorate. That is why all statements made during 
electoral campaigns have a specific character. Intended to gain 
as many electors as possible, they usually exaggerate the 
assumed expectations of the electorate. That is why many of the 
things stated during electoral campaigns are never implemented 
after the elections are over. Thus, the stance adopted by the 
two Chisinau leaders actually reflects the current public frame 
of mind in the Republic of Moldova. Obviously, if the great 
majority of the population would have favored unification with 
Romania, no one could have afforded to make statements clearly 
rejecting unification. Even the two politicians in question, 
even if they had been bitter enemies of unification, would not 
have merely avoided publicly rejecting it, but rather, they 
would have even pleaded in favor of unification. 
  Even if that would have meant acting against their inner 
convictions, they would have still been compelled to do so to 
gain more votes. The fact that, at the peak of the electoral 
campaign, Snegur and Motpan insisted on distancing themselves 
from the cause of unification proves that, in reality, the 
current public mind in the Republic of Moldova is against the 
unification. Regardless of their private convictions regarding 
the reunion of the country, the two politicians considered it 
necessary to speak up against it in order to please the 
electorate. Actually this is the most grave significance of the 
statements made by Snegur and Motpan. In spite of the illusions 
nurtured in Bucharest, they come to demonstrate that the great 
majority of the population in the Republic of Moldova opposes 
the unification. 
  Many people living on our side of the Prut River will 
probably be astonished by such a frame of mind in Bessarabia. 
Their astonishment is absolutely understandable. The issue of 
Bessarabia has been preoccupying the Romanians not only 
recently, but rather over the last several decades. Since 1944, 
when Bessarabia was lost again [to the benefit of USSR], none of 
the politicians or journalists has seriously examined the 
psychological and moral state of the Romanians living across the 
Prut River. During the communist regime, even in the Ceausescu 
era, it was impossible to publicly approach that issue. News 
about the state of mind of the Romanians over the Prut River 
could merely be conveyed to the Romanians living in Romania 
through underground channels. However, the use of that channel 
inevitably led to the creation of a false image. During the 
[Gheorghe] Gheorghiu-Dej era [late fifties, early sixties], that 
image was influenced by the Soviet occupation [of Romania]. 
Hating that occupation, the Romanians had the impression that 
the Russians prevented the Bessarabian Romanians from uniting 
with us. Whoever dared talk about the fact that Bessarabia is an 
ancient Romanian territory and that some day it might join the 
mother country was exposing himself to deadly danger. Under 
such circumstances, the fact that the discussion of the issue 
was prohibited led to the following reasoning: The Soviet 
occupation punishes the discourse on Bessarabia because the 
Romanians on the other bank of the Prut River want to unite with 
the mother country. That is absolutely false reasoning, because 
it ignores the specific nature of the communist dictatorship, 
namely that it always feels imperiled, even there where there is 
no peril whatsoever. Actually, their prohibiting all 
discussions on Bessarabia was not necessarily caused by the fact 
that Moscow considered this the sole way to prevent the 
unification of the Romanians living in the Republic of Moldova 
with the mother nation. During the Ceausescu era, the false 
image about the frame of mind of the Romanians across the Prut 
River was nourished, as paradoxical as it may seem, by the 
[Romanian] officials. Bucharest turned its conflict with Moscow 
into a substantial political capital. Therefore it was quite 
simple for it to hint at the fact that one of the reasons of 
that conflict was precisely the issue of Bessarabia. As a 
matter of fact, using the method of spreading misleading 
information, the Securitate made enormous efforts to convince 
the population that Nicolae Ceausescu would have liked to 
achieve the unification, but could not because of the existence 
of the Soviet power. It is no accident that after December 1989 
the forces that feel nostalgic about Ceausescu began to 
circulate the thesis according to which the fall of the dictator 
was caused by the fact that, by the end of 1989, he had pointed 
the issue of Bessarabia at Gorbachev. Unfortunately, in spite 
of the past four years' climate favoring the freedom of opinion, 
the position of the Romanians across the Prut River could not be 
approached with sufficient lucidity either. Once a prohibited 
subject, the issue of Bessarabia has become the favorite issue 
of journalists and politicians. Under such circumstances, as a 
reaction to the preceding situation, it was absolutely normal 
that they would exaggerate certain facts in the Republic of 
Moldova. In that sense, it is more than significant that 
thousands of pages of minor lyrical writings have been dedicated 
to the brethren across the Prut River and to their impetuous 
struggle to reunite with the mother country. At the same time, 
the issue of Bessarabia has also become the object of intense 
political demagogy. The issue of unification has been used in 
every conceivable way by all our political parties. While doing 
so, no one seemed to care whether they really wish to unite with 
us. As in the preceding period, it was inferred that the 
Romanians living in the Republic of Moldova were impatiently 
looking forward to their unification with the mother country, 
but, alas, the realization of their dream was blocked by 
Moscow's imperial policy. 
  However, a more lucid analysis would reveal clearly the 
fact that current reality in Moldova is much more bitter than 
the illusory things believed by Romanian public opinion and the 
image offered by our political and journalistic demagogy. As 
demonstrated by Snegur's and Motpan's recent statements made 
during the electoral campaign, the Romanians across the Prut 
River are not at all impatient to reunite with us. The causes 
of that frame of mind are complex and profound. Their 
exhaustive analysis would exceed 100 pages. That is why we will 
briefly mention just a few of them, hoping that the day will 
come when our journalists and politicians will approach the 
reality in the Republic of Moldova with much less sentimentality 
than they have until now. One of the causes is doubtlessly the 
frightening Russification process the Romanian population across 
the Prut River has been submitted to. That process did not 
confine itself, as might be thought, merely to a communist-type 
propaganda, pounding the people's heads, day in, day out, with 
ideas about the existence of a separate Moldovan nation and the 
Romanians having invaded their land. Russification was also 
carried out by using more subtle propaganda methods. Thus, 
using manifold channels, they nourished their sentiment of 
belonging to a superpower. As paradoxical as it may seem, over 
many years Russian imperial vanity did matter a great deal to 
many Romanians. The fact that the Red Army posed a threat to 
all of Europe and the Soviet Union was a superpower made them 
believe that they could be as proud of it as the Russians. 
After all, the Republic of Moldova was part of the superpower 
called the Soviet Union. Furthermore, Russification was also 
carried out by turning pro-Russian gestures into criteria for 
deciding on an individuals' political and professional ascent. 
It was enormously important, not just for one to become a boss, 
but also to be admitted to university, to be married to a 
Russian or to be able to speak Russian and know the Russian 
culture perfectly. In the beginning, the Romanians complied 
with these things with a certain duplicity. Little by little, 
however, they adopted, without really meaning to, many elements 
of Russian spirituality. Under such circumstances, in spite of 
the odes written and recited in Chisinau or the statements made 
by a handful of people belonging to the minority of 
intellectuals, many Romanians living in Bessarabia view Romanian 
spirituality, that is, actually their own spirituality, as 
something that is strange to them. They consider reunification 
with Romania not just as an act that is difficult to achieve 
politically, but also psychologically and intellectually. 
  Normally, the statements made by the two personalities 
should 
have awakened us to reality. Unfortunately, as anyone can see 
from the stances adopted by our journalists and politicians, 
they did not manage to do so. Our illusions regarding the frame 
of mind of the Romanians in Bessarabia still persist. And this 
might have extremely grave consequences, even for the great 
cause of our reunification.

<F P=106> [Article by Frane Plancic: "Ultimatum -- the First Step"] </F>
  [Text] The NATO ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs, and thus 
to Serbia too, is the first such act in the history of the 
Western military Alliance, and the first that extends beyond the 
range of its responsibility. In that it has a historical 
importance, politically unsurpassed in post-Cold-War Europe. 
  The military importance of the ultimatum, however, is much 
clearer, especially as it has been presented in a relatively 
precise way, so it seems that this component completely 
determines the limits of political engagement, that is, that the 
matter concerns a military ultimatum, a decisive threat saying 
that the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina should end. This 
interpretation of the ultimatum is based on the justified wishes 
of the Croats and Muslims, but it is not contained in the text 
of the ultimatum. 
  This is a fact, and we can expect some more ultimatums of 
the 
same content until the Croats (in Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina) and the Muslims (in Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
elsewhere) establish joint political, military, intellectual, 
and all other fronts against the aggressor. Only that could be 
the basis of a politically clearer and more substantial 
ultimatum of the Western Alliance, and, what is more important, 
of a clear account with Moscow. 
  These are only some of the reasons for the Croats and 
Muslims 
not to expect allied air strikes on Serb targets in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina or Serbia too soon. It is quite certain that 
this will not happen, because the Bosnian Serbs have decided to 
withdraw, as was the case with the Serb rebels in Croatia, when 
most of the Serbian troops withdrew from Croatia. 
  The artillery-missile troops of the Bosnian Serbs are 
therefore withdrawing from the positions from which they have 
been stifling Sarajevo, and it is to be expected that they will 
not offer armed resistance to the opening of Tuzla airport and 
the Muslim enclaves in the Drina River valley. Their military 
adventures elsewhere in Bosnia-Herzegovina have thus been 
significantly weakened, and so have those in Croatia. However, 
the Serb offensive potential has not been disabled or destroyed, 
which, intimately, each of us wishes, as do the countries 
bordering with Serbia, as can be discerned from their Geneva 
meeting regarding the balance of military power on the Balkans 
and reducing them to an acceptable defense level. 
  Considering all this, we can conclude that the NATO 
ultimatum 
to the Bosnian Serbs is at the same time an indirect message to 
the Serb rebels in Croatia and to the military-police regime 
that is in power in Serbia. 
  The content of the message is that they should put a time 
limit on their military actions on the territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, that they should limit the use of certain 
kinds of weapons, and even limit the targets. Croatia received 
a similar message in late 1992. It accepted it and started 
creating the conditions for resolving the war by political 
means. Serbia and the so-called Srpska republic should not be 
expected to accept the NATO message-ultimatum from such prudent 
positions. They will accept it simply because they must accept 
it, and will observe it until they have to, and where they have 
to. 
  This has been happening so far. During the past two years, 
the Serb armed forces were limited by time, space, and means, by 
which they were forced into a defensive, a strategic defense of 
the conquered territories. 
  The first such limit was imposed on the sea front -- thanks 
to the activities of the Croatian Navy and the naval forces of 
the Western alliance. The strategy of Croatian defense and the 
liberation of the occupied territories was thus simplified. The 
significance of this at present is the inability of the Serb 
policy of conquest to indirectly improve the position in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina by threatening Croatia from the sea, that is, 
the all of southern Croatian and Herzegovina. 
  The following such limit was imposed on the use of Serb air 
forces. It was also imposed toward the end of the war against 
Croatia, and supported during the war against Bosnia-Herzegovina 
by ultimatums and patrols by the allied air forces. Thus, the 
Serbian aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina lost its second 
important strategic support. 
  The third, most important strategic support of the 
aggression 
have been the land forces. Following the bad experience in 
Croatia, where they attempted to fight the classical way, these 
forces -- the only remaining ones -- could carry out the 
strategy of conquest only using ways and means employed in 
stifling Sarajevo or conquering the territory along the Drina 
River. 
  The methods are familiar. They boil down to the expression 
"genocidal cleansing of desired territory." This -- and the NATO 
ultimatum does not mention it because it is not within its 
jurisdiction -- displays all the weakness of the ultimatum-like 
political position of the West toward Serbia. 
  The means are also familiar. They boil down to 
artillery-missile strikes, taking dominant positions, and 
destroying everything that is not Serb or that will not be 
useful. This -- though it is within the NATO jurisdiction -- 
also does not comprise as much as the meaning of the word 
"ultimatum" does. The truth is that it does relate to those 
means also, but only on one or two territories and in certain 
situations, and it leaves them in the hands of the aggressor, 
failing to threaten the aggressor's strong negotiating position, 
which is the worst thing. 
  The limits imposed through the ultimatum on the use of the 
Serb armed forces -- primarily naval, then air forces, and now 
also the ground forces -- introduces the new quality described 
above into the war for Bosnia-Herzegovina; a gradual and 
increasingly decisive pushing out of the Serb armed forces from 
the conquered territories. The humanitarian "intervention" can 
now only count on success. Their combination is, however, a sure 
failure without political intervention, which will not occur 
with the attitudes current in Russia and Greece. This is what 
Serbia relies on, withdrawing and not having withdrawn for three 
years.

  [Text] Zagreb, Feb 16 (AFP) -- An UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] fact-finding mission has been unable to determine the 
origin of mortar fire that killed 68 people in a Sarajevo market 
earlier this month, an official of the United Nations Protection 
Force in Yugoslavia announced Wednesday. 
  The mortar shell which also wounded 200 other people on 
February 5 may have been fired by either side, Serb or Moslem, 
Canadian Colonel Michel Gauthier, who heads the investigation 
committee, told the press.

<F P=106> [Report by Enes Musabasic on statements by President Alija </F>
Izetbegovic of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency and Charles 
Redman, special U.S. envoy at the Geneva talks, in Sarajevo on 
15 February -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Musabasic] After holding talks with Charles 
Redman, special U.S. envoy at the Geneva talks, Alija 
Izetbegovic, president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, 
said that the talks focused on the continuation of the peace 
process, the effective cease-fire on the Sarajevo front, and the 
execution of the NATO declaration. 
  [Izetbegovic] Mr. Redman reiterated the readiness of the 
U.S. Government to insist as a NATO member on the complete and 
consistent execution of the 10 February declaration, to be 
carried out without condition or change. This is what Mr. 
Christopher also confirmed in a telephone conversation with me 
late last night. He called me at about midnight to present the 
view of the U.S. Government on this issue. He had heard that we 
were concerned that a certain hesitation had emerged, and that 
certain misinterpretations by lower-ranking officers in the UN 
Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] had been put forward. Mr. 
Christopher -- now that I have mentioned that conversation -- 
insisted that we too, for our part, observe the cease-fire. I 
promised him that and that is what we will do. I also said that 
there would be no front line changes on our part in Sarajevo. 
The Presidency also reiterated that point yesterday. 
  As for the peace negotiations, Mr. Redman and I have 
discussed ways for furthering the talks, and (we presented 
various ideas) on this issue. We concluded, among other things, 
that the clashes in central Bosnia had to stop in order to 
facilitate negotiations between us and Croatia on a more 
constructive basis. When it comes to talks on the resumption of 
the Geneva negotiations, we expressed our readiness to continue 
with them in order to reach the finale, that is, to establish a 
just peace. As you know, the United States has decided to 
participate actively in these talks, which is a good sign and 
will definitely contribute to these talks being more successful 
and effective than has been the case so far. 
  [Musabasic] Charles Redman first stressed that the talks in 
Sarajevo were very useful and productive, and added: 
  [Redman, in English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian 
translation] Of course a lot of people here in Sarajevo will 
focus on the NATO ultimatum and whether it will be followed up. 
I certainly hope that it will be, and I think that there are 
many indications that it will be realized. However, at the same 
time one of the main reasons for my being here is to see whether 
we can use this new momentum to put some energy into the peace 
negotiations. I believe that we all agree. We have held very 
serious talks on ways in which we can try to strengthen the 
efforts towards resolving the negotiations in order to reach 
finally a solution acceptable to all sides. 
  It will not be easy. It is something that has been discussed 
for months, but I hope that the involvement of the United States 
-- with strong support and in full cooperation with the European 
Union, and consultations with the Russian Federation -- will 
help us find new ways to resolve the problems that have been 
preventing a negotiated settlement from being reached. 
  So, this is still in an exploratory phase, as we consider 
various options. I think that we have identified some useful 
ideas, and I will be working on that, (and in some other 
places), but I will remain in constant touch with President 
Izetbegovic, Prime Minister Silajdzic, and the government in 
Sarajevo so that we can reach a lasting peace in Bosnia.

  [Text] As our correspondent from Bihac, Mirza Sadikovic, 
reports, the Serbian aggressor today continues with fierce 
attacks on Bihac. The heroes of the 5th Corps are resisting 
horrendous artillery-tank cannonades and infantry attacks that 
are being carried out in waves by the so-called Glamoc Wolves -- 
Karadzic's killers and mercenaries. Helicopters have been 
reintroduced again which are skillfully taking advantage of 
[word indistinct] and performing a twofold task. First, they 
are bringing heavy artillery from the hills around Sarajevo and 
at the same time surveying the hills. They help in evacuation 
of injured and killed chetniks, whose number in Vrapcici is 
growing. Several tens of howitzer bombs have landed on the 
villages around Cazin and Bihac since this morning. While the 
heroes of the 5th Corps and the people of the free part of the 
Bihac district have been bleeding for 11 days, dying on the 
streets while everything here is being destroyed, Fikret Abdic 
[president of autonomous region of western Bosnia] proceeds in 
his shameful task of betraying his own people. In the morning 
the forces of his army in the Cazin commune again attacked the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army soldiers in the area [word indistinct] 
and (?Resic). Because the attacks are still underway, no 
information about the casualties has been released yet, but it 
is certain that several of the 5th Corps soldiers have been 
wounded. 
  The Croatian Army is attacking the center of Gornji Vakuf 
today also. Our correspondent Akif Agic reports that the 
Croatian offensive in central Bosnia is suffering blows daily. 
  Yesterday, the enemy continued with the provocations in the 
zone of responsibility of the 3d Operative Group. Our 
correspondent Smajl Terzic reports that in Tesanj, in the 
Kalosevic area, a great number of our fighters managed to repel 
what has, so far, been the strongest enemy infantry attack. In 
the ensuing counterattack in the form of a saboteur action, they 
inflicted great losses in manpower to the enemy. 
  As the information service of the 1st Corps reports, some 
parts of the town [Sarajevo] were not spared the chetnik 
activities today either. The aggressor is contemplating [words 
indistinct] cease-fire. This particularly refers to Sokolje and 
its surroundings, which has been targeted by antiaircraft 
machine guns from Rajlovac since early morning. [Word 
indistinct] localities from the same direction several tens of 
grenades have landed already. Chetnik killers with sniper 
rifles with silencers are active at several localities in the 
town. In the vicinity of Vrbanja Most, one person was killed. 
The perfidiousness of [word indistinct] is, therefore, 
limitless. (?The Army) urges maximal caution while moving about 
the town.

<F P=106> [Interview with Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian </F>
Serbs, by unidentified correspondent; place not given; Karadzic 
and the correspondent speak in English with superimposed 
Serbo-Croatian translation -- recorded] 
  [Text] Speaking at a news conference today, Radovan 
Karadzic, president of the Srpska republic, said that the 
decision on whether NATO will bomb us or not does not depend on 
the Serbian side. The Srpska republic will tomorrow issue an 
official statement on the NATO ultimatum. This is what Karadzic 
told the British (WTN) Agency: 
  [Correspondent] Do you envisage handing over any more heavy 
weapons to the United Nations or are you going to leave them 
where they are, albeit under UN control? 
  [Karadzic] We are going to make some combinations. We are 
probably going to give something over and to regroup something 
in order to make it possible for the United Nations to have 
efficient control. We also want reciprocity from the Muslim 
side. 
  [Correspondent] Do you think we are now closer to an 
agreement? 
  [Karadzic] Well, I think we may be closer since the United 
States has interfered. The United States cannot afford to 
interfere and not to come and help peace to be reached. The 
United States and Russia will probably have the last word, but 
probably in line with a plan by the European Union. In any 
case, we are ready for peace, we are ready to give over some 
territories that we control, and even some traditionally Serbian 
territories, but we are not going to go much below 64 percent of 
the private property that we possess. For peace and in the 
name of peace we are going to give something, but not everything. 
  [Correspondent] Do you think that air strikes are now more 
or less likely? 
  [Karadzic] Air strikes have always been realistic. We have 
always taken them seriously, not because of other people's 
behavior, but because of NATO's internal needs. NATO is 
experiencing a deep crisis just as the Western alliance is. 
They are showing their muscle and in our case they are also 
trying to scare Russia. They are doing things that are going 
simply to interrupt and destroy the NATO alliance. The NATO 
alliance is not needed in this war. NATO resembles a giant who 
has no feeling for reality. It will try to destroy somebody, 
but will destroy itself this time. If there are any air 
strikes, many NATO nations are going to distance themselves from 
this moral catastrophe. Then they are going to become 
completely divided.

  [Text] Jahorina, 15 Feb (TANJUG) -- The Serb side is ready 
to move some of its weapons to enable more efficient control, 
Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska republic said at 
Jahorina [near Sarajevo] today. 
  At a very well attended news conference, Karadzic said that 
the decision on whether NATO will bomb us or not does not depend 
on the Serb side. 
  By tomorrow we will issue an official statement regarding 
the 
NATO ultimatum. We are not an internationally recognized state 
and therefore an ultimatum in such a form cannot be issued to 
us, Karadzic said, adding that such moves were unnecessary and 
reminded him of knocking on an open door. 
  To explain this assertion, he recalled that on 7 February 
all 
details of the demilitarization of Sarajevo had been agreed with 
Yasushi Akashi. 
  We are satisfied with the UN mission and its unbiased 
position and we fully cooperate with their representatives in 
order to reduce tension, but we are not satisfied with the NATO 
position, for their decisions are completely anti-Serb, Karadzic 
said, and stressed that he subsequently welcomed the additional 
explanations by the United States and Russia that the ultimatum 
referred to all the warring sides, and not only to the Serbs. 
  We are a small people who are fighting for their freedom and 
rights, something to which other people are entitled. If NATO 
exists only to threaten small peoples, then its' member 
countries ought to ask themselves what they spend so much money 
on, Karadzic said, emphasizing the Serbian people's gratitude to 
Russia. We must, however, rely on our own forces while 
believing that there is commonsense in one part of the 
international community. 
  In reply to questions that referred to the withdrawal of 
Serb 
artillery around Sarajevo, Karadzic stressed the Serb side's 
willingness to move some of the weaponry in order to facilitate 
more effective UN control, since the UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] lacks staff who can effectively control all the armed 
positions. 
  We are going to group some of the weaponry to enable 
observers to take control more easily, something that should 
lead to the further restoration of peace in Sarajevo and that 
could set a precedent for other areas in ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
Peace does not suit the Muslim side, though. Their true 
intentions will soon be revealed, Karadzic cautions. 
  Both the United Nations and the Serb side want a lasting 
peace in Sarajevo, which is not a besieged city but a city split 
into a Serb and a Muslim part, a situation that will remain 
pending a final political settlement, Karadzic said. By no 
means are we going to provoke NATO, as we know to what extent 
some circles in the West are interested in continuing the 
bloodshed, because their ultimate aim is to demonstrate force to 
Russia by punishing the Serbs, Radovan Karadzic, president of 
the Srpska republic said at today's news conference.

  [Text] As we mentioned in the headlines, Radovan Karadzic, 
president of the Srpska republic, held a news conference today. 
He spoke about the current political circumstances surrounding 
the resolving -- that is, the complicating -- of the situation 
in and around Bosnia. Coming up now, at the beginning of our 
bulletin, are several highlights from the address the president 
of our republic delivered to a large number of reporters. 
  [Begin Karadzic recording] The truth of the terrorist event 
in Merkale [Sarajevo's marketplace] has further crystallized. 
There is an increasing amount of evidence that this was a 
terrorist act. There are clear testimonies that no one heard any 
whistling sound from the shell and that, evidently, this was not 
a shell. The crater is too small. The number of dead and 
wounded is out of all proportion for a 120-mm shell. Turkish 
doctor (Senegal Karlovac) told CNN, in its diplomatic licence 
program, that he had seen the wounded and that all their wounds 
were inflicted below the waist level, that some of the wounds 
were burns, that there were no traces of alien material -- that 
is, no shrapnel in the bodies and that most deaths had been 
caused by internal damage to organs due to the explosion. 
  It is evident that the wounds and burns are most likely to 
have been inflicted by phosphorus. We have been in contact with 
a group of Israeli experts on terrorism. They told us this 
morning that, on the basis of all the data they had, they were 
able to draw a conclusion that this was a cone-shaped explosive 
whose flat side was aimed at the victims, that this explosive 
was either triggered on the spot or dropped from a neighbouring 
building, and that this was the form of terrorism practised by 
Hezbollah and Afghans. 
  I also want to tell you that we have obtained reliable 
reports that the Muslim side is planning to stage further 
incidents, probably once the ultimatum deadline has expired. 
There is also a plan for an attack by Muslim forces disguised 
in Serbian uniforms on a small UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] 
squad, most probably a French squad. According to this plan 
there would be no survivors, all the soldiers would be killed, 
and even several dead Serbs, wearing uniforms of the Serb army, 
would remain on the spot, having been killed earlier. This is a 
very hellish plan which is supposed to fuel the tension in the 
world which is at the moment by and large on the wane. [end

  [Excerpts] Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska 
republic, gave a news conference in the international press 
center on Mount Jahorina today. Numerous journalists' questions 
referred to the current situation in the Srpska republic after 
the latest NATO threats. [passage omitted] 
  The ultimatum is a direct consequence of the Sarajevo 
massacre. An international investigative commission has been set 
up. Asked by a reporter whether the Serbs will insist that the 
investigation be fully completed by the ultimatum deadline and 
whether the operation of withdrawing Serb artillery will be 
canceled if the investigation ends up with some positive results 
for the Serb side, and whether the international community will 
turn the spearhead of its ultimatum on to the perpetrators in 
such a case, Radovan Karadzic replied: 
  [Begin Karadzic recording] I believe that the international 
community already knows who committed the massacre in Merkale 
marketplace. It is in our interest to have the investigation 
carried out as soon as possible and to have the results 
published as soon as possible. The main reason is that delaying 
the investigation will result in the loss of evidence; the 
passage of time blurs any conclusions about the perpetrator of 
this crime, this act of terrorism. 
  We believe that the Muslim side is doing everything to 
disguise and conceal the evidence so as to prevent the 
commission from drawing adequate legal conclusions. This 
nothwithstanding, even if the fact that it was the Muslims who 
did it is revealed and announced, NATO and some countries, some 
NATO member countries, will not change their decision regarding 
the Serbs. Although they know all too well what the Serbs are 
doing, that the Serbs favor peace whereas the Muslims opt for 
war, they have not changed their attitude. [end recording] 
  At today's news conference the president of the Srpska 
republic also spoke about the UN Security Council's current 
position and Russia's stance in this context. 
  [Begin Karadzic recording] I believe that the UN Security 
Council is in a precarious situation, as it is clear that the 
Serb side is doing its best to bring about peace while the 
Muslim side is advocating war. There is, however, no 
willingness within the UN Security Council and the international 
community to tell the full truth. In this light the position of 
the UN Security Council is delicate. China's attitude to this 
issue, though, is to be applauded. I also believe that Russia 
is getting increasingly aware that the true target of the entire 
campaign and crisis is Russia rather than Serbia. [end recording]

  [Text] Zagreb, Feb 15 (AFP) -- Russia would under no 
circumstances sent troops to bolster the UN contingent in 
Sarajevo to enforce adherence to the NATO air strikes ultimatum, 
Moscow's envoy to Bosnia said here late Tuesday. 
  Vitaly Churkin said it was "absolutely unthinkable" that 
Russian forces should be "somewhere on the ground where their 
lives and safety can be endangered" as a result of the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organisation decision. 
  He recalled that the NATO ultimatum giving Bosnian Serbs 
until midnight Sunday to withdraw their heavy weapons from 
around Sarajevo or face air strikes had been taken without 
consulting Moscow. 
  President Boris Yeltsin's envoy travelled to Zagreb from the 
Bosnian capital, where he met Bosnian government leaders, and 
Bosnian Serb and United Nations Protection Force commanders.

  [Text] As we have already said, Vitaliy Churkin, Russian 
envoy to the Geneva talks, visited Sarajevo today. After he had 
held talks with Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency, 
Churkin met and held talks with Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic. 
Summing up today's talks, Churkin told journalists the 
following. 
  [Begin Churkin recording, in English with superimposed 
Serbo-Croatian translation] First of all, I am very glad to 
have had the opportunity to meet Prime Minister Silajdzic and 
President Izetbegovic. This time I came here mainly because I 
wanted to see that the military disengagement that has started 
around Sarajevo is being carried out without a problem. You may 
recall that shortly after the tragedy in this town on 5 
February, Russia demanded that the siege around Sarajevo be 
lifted, (?immediately). 
  We are following this process very carefully and are trying 
to do what we can to make sure that this process continues. If 
this process turns out to be successful, we will have a new 
opportunity to find a political solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
as a whole. I am very encouraged by what I heard today from 
President Izetbegovic and Prime Minister Silajdzic. 
  Naturally, I stressed that we hope that the forces of the 
Bosnian Government will show restraint in the days and weeks 
ahead. This will be demanded from all sides. I was also 
encouraged by the fact that the hosts spoke not only about the 
current crisis in and around Sarajevo, but also about the 
prospects for a political solution, and even more than that, 
about what can be accomplished between us in the time of peace 
that will hopefully come soon. [end recording] 
  Briefly addressing journalists, Prime Minister Silajdzic 
stressed two aspects of today's talks. 
  [Begin Silajdzic recording, in English with superimposed 
Serbo-Croatian translation] The first is that we asked Mr. 
Churkin to influence as much as possible the situation in 
Sandzak, which is not in line with rapprochement and the peace 
talks. People are being arrested in Sandzak. The situation in 
Sandzak is very grave. We fear that the conflict could 
escalate, that stronger, more repressive measures could be 
taken. We know that 200 people have been arrested. We asked 
Mr. Churkin to work in this direction with the people in 
Belgrade as much as he can. 
  This was one issue. The other issue concerned the 
possibilities for developing Bosnian-Russian relations in the 
future. We think that these relations do not have to be at the 
present level, and that they could be developed in the direction 
of global rapprochement. We are all slowly beginning to live in 
this global village. [sentence as heard] These are the two 
issues. Mr. Churkin spoke about other aspects of the talks. 
[end recording] 
  Vitaliy Churkin then commented on his statement for Belgrade 
Radio that Russia will put a stop to the prospect of air strikes 
on Serbian positions. 
  [Begin Churkin recording, in English with superimposed 
Serbo-Croatian translation] I do not recall saying anything 
like that. The media also reported that a joint statement was 
issued after my meeting with Milosevic. This is not correct. 
There was no joint statement, neither a formal nor an informal 
statement. What I stressed, and I can repeat it, is that we 
believe that everything must be done to achieve this encouraging 
process of peaceful military disengagement in and around 
Sarajevo. I think that continuing the fighting and 
confrontations is in noone's interest. In this sense, yes, we 
are trying everything to prevent the escalation of the conflict 
here. 
  However, I am also saying personally and publicly that if 
the 
process of demilitarization in and around Sarajevo fails, worst 
things will happen. I have made this point again and again. 
[end recording] 
  The journalists were than again addressed by Prime Minister 
Silajdzic. 
  [Begin Silajdzic recording, in English with superimposed 
Serbo-Croatian translation] This must be the first step toward 
peace. NATO's ultimatum should be the first step toward peace, 
because, as I have stressed in the past, there used to be a 
military imbalance. This ultimatum is now restoring this balance 
to a certain degree. I believe that the balance of power 
maintained peace in Europe for 50 years. This principle was 
abandoned with everything else in Bosnia, but is now coming 
back. This will not be easy. However, goodwill must exist on 
all sides. Regarding our side, this will exists. We will meet 
all our obligations and we are striving for peace. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Bileca, 15 Feb (TANJUG) -- The Command of the 
Herzegovina Corps today issued a cautionary note to the 
population of this area. It says that protective measures 
should be immediately taken to provide maximum protection for 
people and property from possible attacks by the NATO air force. 
  It stresses that it is necessary to tidy up cellars and 
communal shelters and secure the most basic quantities of food 
and equipment for administering first aid to the wounded. In 
the event of attack one should behave sensibly and follow 
instructions by civil defense officials. 
  The Command of the Herzegovina Corps believes that the 
territory of Serbian Herzegovina can be threatened by deliberate 
bombardment as well as by technical faults along the flight path 
of NATO aircraft. It also points out the possibility of 
aircraft carrying lethal loads being shot down or crashing into 
each other and their dropping lethal loads at random on 
inhabited settlements. 
  "Serb units are taking every measure to protect free 
territory and the population from possible attacks by the NATO 
air force and they will warn the population in time about any 
possible threat from the air," the Command of the Herzegovina 
Corps says in its warning announcement.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The 31 January issue of the Split daily 
SLOBODNA DALMACIJA on page 4 reports that, in the event of NATO 
air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, there is no doubt that 
the majority of entrenched Serb batteries would be erased in a 
few minutes. However, the paper adds, Serb reinforcements and 
reserves massed in the vicinity of Tuzla (for example around 
Bijeljina) and Srebrenica (where the so-called Drina Corps with 
six brigades is operating) are sufficient to continue to hinder 
the deblocking of both Srebrenica and Dubrava. NATO would then 
certainly have to repeat and expand the air strikes to the 
Bosnian Serbs' "remaining strategic centers." The action would 
have to be on at least the scale of the several consecutive, 
mass attacks on Iraq in the first half of last year, the paper 
notes, adding that the Serbs believe that they would be able to 
survive the "first, selective attack from the sky, and then, 
while they still have the upper hand on the land, they would 
begin conducting what they have been announcing for a long time: 
an all-out war against all UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
combining the experience of the Vietnam guerrillas with the 
tactics that the Blue Helmets have already felt themselves in 
Somalia."

<F P=106> [Report by Mirza Sadikovic] </F>
  [Excerpt] Yet another chetnik offensive, this time in the 
Bihac region, has failed to yield results. The traitor Fikret 
Abdic has many problems maintaining his authority in the Kladusa 
region. 
  [Sadikovic] The preoccupation of Bihac region residents and 
members of the 5th Corps of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina with 
internal clashes and the agreed support of Fikret Abdic, were 
obviously the reason Radovan Karadzic launched his strongest 
offensive so far to finally finish off the Bihac pocket, the 
Muslim enclave not in physical contact with Sarajevo. 
  Four brigades and a few additional chetnik units were 
supposed to capture the Grmecko-Srbljanski plateau and Grabez in 
the first stage, and in the second reach the right bank of the 
Una river. At the same time, Fikret Abdic's so-called forces 
were supposed to enter Cazin, link up with the 
Grmecko-Srbljanski plateau and then enter Bihac itself with the 
help of the Croatian Defense Council, which allegedly controls 
the plateau. 
  However, this did not happen. The heros of the 5th Corps 
have been resisting the chetniks for 10 days. Chetniks did not 
make much progress from the Grabez wasteland. Kladusa's Babo 
[Fikret Abdic] also spoiled the game. He did not carry out any 
of his promises. The conscience of the residents of Velika 
Kladusa came to the fore. They expressed allegiance to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the 5th Corps. Abdic now has the problem 
of how to keep back hundreds, even thousands of those who want 
to go to Bihac. He appealed for help in the fight against the 
5th Corps, forgetting that it was actually the local people who 
make up the 5th Corps. Neither Milosevic nor Tudjman are 
listening to him any longer. He has yet to settle accounts with 
Karadzic. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Sarajevo, 15 Feb (TANJUG) -- General Ratko 
Mladic, commander of the general staff of the Srpska army, said 
after meeting UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] commanders in 
Lukavica today that there will be no withdrawal of Serb 
artillery. 
  "We will not leave our people -- who have always lived here 
-- unprotected. We have no right to do something like that and 
nothing can force us to abandon our people to the mercy of the 
fanatical Muslim units," he said. 
  Mladic held talks today with General Jean Cot, UNPROFOR 
commander for the former Yugoslavia, and General Michael Rose, 
UNPROFOR commander for the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Deputy 
Russian Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin attended a part of the 
talks. 
  General Mladic described the talks with Generals Cot and 
Rose 
as very useful. "We exchanged views and I promised them we will 
fully observe the cease-fire agreed on 10 February and that we 
are ready to discuss any contentious issues with the other 
side," he said. 
  Mladic recalled that it was the Muslims who started the war 
against the Serbs, declaring it jointly with the Croats, and 
that now the Bosnian Serbs expect that "those who declared war 
on us should withdraw such a declaration now." 
  "When this happens at the highest political level, then 
everything else will be technical detail," General Mladic said, 
adding that "we are offering peace to our adversaries and we 
will try to halt any combat activities in Sarajevo in the 
forthcoming period." 
  Asked what kind of guarantees the Serb side demanded from 
NATO, General Mladic said he expects that "NATO will understand 
the trick of the Muslim side, which wants Sarajevo to ignite a 
new world war." 
  "I expect all NATO members to perform their duties and 
threaten the Serbs as much as the Serbs are threatening them. I 
also told Cot that every member of the international forces and 
humanitarian organizations has been and will be safe on our 
territory. NATO should stick to its original policy -- 
defending the territories of those countries that created it. 
If I were in the shoes of the people who make decisions in 
NATO, I would not be transforming that organization into an 
international beating stick, because each stick has got two ends 
and does not have a part that cannot be broken," Mladic said. 
  Commenting on the failure of the Muslim army commander Rasim 
Delic to attend the meeting, allegedly due to other business 
engagements, Mladic said that "General Delic is in fact busy 
with affairs in central Bosnia, where he is waging a war against 
the Croats." 
  "However, for them this is only an excuse, because most 
probably they are not going to contact us before 21 February, 
expecting NATO to do their job. They are fervently hoping that 
air strikes against the Serb people, villages, towns, and army 
will take place and are doing everything for this to happen," 
Mladic said. 
  Speaking about the withdrawal of the Serb artillery from 
positions surrounding Sarajevo, Mladic said that this could be 
discussed only after the signing of a peace agreement. 
  "We will allow UN observers to be deployed at certain 
positions and I will not disclose any other details in this 
connection. I told General Cot what to suggest to the Muslim 
side. I believe you understand that as soon as I withdraw our 
forces from Sarajevo, I will leave the Serb population to be 
slaughtered by the Muslims, as happened on 4 May 1992," Mladic 
said. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Pool" item; commentary by Vladimir Resetar] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 15 (TANJUG) -- The published 
transcript of the phone-in programme broadcast by the 
Sarajevo-based Moslem radio station Hayat on February 5, after 
the massacre at the Markale open air market, a programme whose 
horrendous message was -- all Serbs should immediately be 
killed, has found no room in reports carried by leading foreign 
news agencies. 
  News agencies failed to react not because they doubted the 
authenticity of the Moslem calls for Serbs to be lynched but 
because of their view of the reality in Bosnia-Herzegovina, a 
view shaped by the political leaderships of the countries in 
which the agencies' headquarters are based. 
  It is not clear why it is in the interest of the West to 
ignore even the obvious aggressiveness of mounting pan-Islamism, 
which itself, has termed the number one threat in the world. 
  "The arrow has been shot and is moving towards its target" 
-- 
were the words of the sentence passed by the Iranian 
fundamentalists, headed by their late religious leader Ayatollah 
Khomeyni, on poet Salman Rushdie five years ago. Rushdie, 
sentenced by fundamentalists for a book he has written, has to 
remain in hiding because the sentence was confirmed yesterday -- 
Rushdie must die, as must also the Serbs in Bosnia. 
  The progressive world public was indignant with the death 
sentence passed on Rushdie by the fundamentalists and it 
strongly reacted, defending the poet. On the other hand, that 
same public is threatening Serbs with NATO bombs and missiles 
only because Serbs do not fit into the visions contained in the 
"Islamic declaration" of Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic. 
  There is no answer to the question what it is that Serbs 
should do to finally eliminate the threats they have been facing 
for two years, i.e., since the outbreak of the Bosnian Moslem 
"holy war" for Izetbegovic's state whose genuinely Islamic order 
would be based on the Koran. 
  All negotiations to date have failed because the Bosnian 
Moslem side has been set on achieving its goal, but has not been 
able to do so because "there are too many Serbs and Croats in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina," as it sets out. 
  The Moslems have rejected all offers made by the Serbs. 
Whatever concessions the Serbs have made, the Moslems have 
asked for more in an effort to achieve their goal by means of 
war. They are not doing bad in central Bosnia, where they are 
confronted with Croats, but they need NATO's assistance in the 
case of Serbs. 
  The world omnipotents, who have engineered the 
disintegration 
of the former Yugoslavia and everything that has happened in the 
past three years, surely know whether NATO's arrow has already 
been shot at the Serbs or if it has just been drawn back. 
  The scenario and stage-managing in Bosnia-Herzegovina have 
been brought to perfection, and the story continues to unfold 
towards its pre-conceived end. Only Serbs in no way fit in. 
They should disappear according to Izetbegovic's idea, but they 
refuse to do so. And, NATO can hardly do anything about it.

  [Text] The aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina continues 
to take its deadly toll, currently at its worst in the Bihac 
region, according to a letter sent today by Alija Izetbegovic, 
president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, to (Cornelio 
Sommaruga), chairman of the International Red Cross Committee. 
  An extremely fierce offensive has been going on for days. 
There have been many civilian casualties. The municipal 
hospital in Bihac is constantly being targeted by the shelling 
and over the last few days it has been hit on nine occasions. 
There have been 14 patients killed and the building itself has 
been seriously damaged, the letter reads. 
  I urge you to declare that this hospital is in a neutral 
zone 
and to make it exempt from all enemy attacks by securing the 
permanent presence of the International Red Cross Committee 
delegates, the letter from President Izetbegovic to (Cornelio 
Sommaruga) concludes.

  [Text] Belgrade, February 14 (TANJUG) -- Several parties 
from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on Monday strongly 
condemned the NATO threats to bomb Serb positions in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, pointing out that this would jeopardize the 
search for a peaceful solution to the crisis in this former 
Yugoslav republic. 
  President of the opposition parliamentary Democratic Party 
Zoran Djindjic said that the NATO ultimatum "is contrary to U.N. 
Security Council resolutions and dangerously threatens the peace 
process" in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Speaking at a meeting in Knjazevac, a town in southeastern 
Serbia, Djindjic assessed that it was evident that the ultimatum 
did not have any humanitarian or security foundations, but was 
primarily a tool to "pressure the Serb negotiators in Geneva." 
  "Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia must join the 
efforts to oppose this dangerous and irresponsible policy of the 
NATO pact," he said. 
  The League of Communists-Movement for Yugoslavia most 
sharply 
condemns the by-passing of the U.N. in seeking a solution for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, said a statement released by the party, 
assessing that the ultimatum was a "threat to all small peoples 
and states if they do not bow to the will of the mighty." 
  "As in World War II, the Communists will place themselves at 
the head of the battle against any foreign aggressor and in the 
interest of the people they will resolutely oppose Western 
military powers and all supporters of the civil war in former 
Yugoslavia," said the statement. 
  The Democratic Party of Yugoslavia sent an appeal to all 
warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina to see reason and opt for 
compromise and agreement by easing tensions at all points. 
  The Party of Serb Unity warned that peace could not be 
achieved with threats and ultimatums. 
  "If only one bomb falls on Serb positions and homes in 
Bosnia, the Party of Serb Unity will put into operation its 
military agreement with the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia 
and call Russian volunteers to stand in the defence of the 
Christian Orthodox religion, side by side with their Serb 
brethren," said a party statement.

<TEXT>
Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The 31 January issue of the Belgrade 
daily POLITIKA on page 7 discusses a "real political scandal" 
going on in Croatia regarding the issue of whether Croatia is 
directly involved in the war in Bosnia. The "affair" resulted 
from the appearance on Croatian Television's "TV Parliament" 
program "several evenings ago" of Vice Vukojevic, a deputy in 
the Croatian parliament and, until recently, chief of the 
security service in the Croatian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
who was wearing the uniform of the Croatian Defense Council 
[HVO], the army of Herceg-Bosna. Moreover, POLITIKA reports, 
Vukojevic, responding to a question from the program's host, 
"coolly answered" that he had been "a member of the HVO since 11 
April 1992" with the rank of brigade commander, a rank above 
that of colonel. What is interesting about this affair, POLITIKA 
observes, is that Vukojevic's appearance in "a foreign uniform" 
provoked "quite a bit of surprise" among the Croatian public and 
even astonishment that Vukojevic was a member of the army of 
another country while holding a high position in the security 
service of Croatia. 
  Of course, there are very few people naive enough to believe 
sincerely the official claims of Croatian leaders that the 
Republic of Croatia is not directly involved in the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, POLITIKA states, adding that even Stipe 
Mesic, the president of the Croatian Assembly, could not deny 
this "very unpleasant fact." POLITIKA cites Mesic's statement in 
the 30 January edition of the Split newspaper FERAL TRIBUNE: 
"Nothing can be concealed, nothing denied, everything is 
accessible to everyone, even to foreign officials. Vice 
Vukojevic is a deputy in the Croatian parliament, and I saw him, 
just as you did, on television in the uniform of a foreign 
country. I do not know how he went there and how he received his 
rank, because I was caught by surprise, just as you were. 
Regardless of how it happened, this is the first case of a 
deputy appearing in the military uniform of another country." 
  POLITIKA states that the Croatian public knew that 
"something 
serious was happening with regard to this issue" when the Social 
Democratic Union issued information that in Zagreb alone about 
2,000 Croatian citizens born in Bosnia-Herzegovina were 
mobilized overnight and, following training in the Kroacija 
[formerly Marshal Tito] Barracks in New Zagreb, sent to the 
front in Bosnia. Those who refused to go were sent to a military 
prison, POLITIKA notes, adding that Croatian lawyer Slobodan 
Budak has lodged appeals about the imposition of army prison 
sentences on two Croat soldiers who refused to fight in another 
country, i.e., Bosnia-Herzegovina. One soldier was a member of 
the 175th Brigade in Zagreb and the other a member of the 101st 
Brigade in Bosanska Posavina.

  [Excerpts] Belgrade, 12 Feb -- Zeljko Simic, deputy prime 
minister of the Federal Government [of Yugoslavia], said at 
[Belgrade's] Surcin airport this evening that serious and 
detailed talks were held today in Zagreb and that they 
represented the realization of previous negotiations. 
  A commission for missing persons and humanitarian issues was 
formally and legally constituted and it would work under the 
auspices of the International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC] 
and the UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees]. 
  The commission has eight members--three each from Yugoslavia 
and from Croatia and one each from the ICRC and the UNHCR. 
  Simic also said that all details in connection with the 
opening of offices in Belgrade and Zagreb were agreed and that 
they would be opened, most likely at the end of this or at the 
beginning of next month. [passage omitted] 
  Simic said that his talks with Croatian President Tudjman 
were successful, pointing out that the Croatian president showed 
that he was very interested in the normalization of relations 
with Yugoslavia. 
  Simic also said that after these talks he was even more 
convinced that meetings at the highest level were, he said, 
"more than realistic." 
  Asked whether the status of the Republic of Serb Krajina 
[RSK] was discussed, Simic said that the Yugoslav standpoints 
were clear but not so inflexible that they could prevent a 
normalization of relations. 
  The issue of Krajina is very sensitive but the RSK is a 
political reality and must be respected, Simic stressed, and 
went on to say that the current situation did not suit Zagreb 
but an aggressive resolution of the situation would suit Zagreb 
even less.

  [Text] Belgrade, 15 Feb (TANJUG) -- Greek Foreign Minister 
Karolos Papoulias, who has held talks in Belgrade with Serbian 
President Slobodan Milosevic, said after the talks today that he 
arrived in Belgrade, as the chairman of the European Union [EU] 
Council of Ministers, to do his utmost to prevent the worst -- 
NATO air attacks against the Bosnian Serbs. 
  "Although we are going through a difficult time, we are 
still 
optimistic to a certain degree and we believe that the worst 
will be avoided. That would be useful not only for the Balkans 
but also for the whole of Europe," Papoulias said. 
  Describing his talks with President of Serbia Slobodan 
Milosevic as "cordial, as usual," Papoulias stressed that at 
this moment in time it is extremely important to direct all 
efforts toward finding a peaceful solution to the Bosnian 
conflict, and also underlined that it is important that all the 
key players accept the EU's peace plan. 
  Reminding journalists that Greece has reservations as 
regards 
the latest NATO decision on the ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs, 
Papoulias said -- stressing that he is speaking about this as 
the Greek foreign minister, not as the EU chairman -- that 
Greece has reservations essentially because it does not believe 
that actions such as air attacks could contribute toward 
achieving peace in Bosnia. 
  "We insist on the resumption of negotiations, that is, on 
finding a solution to the Bosnian conflict through negotiation," 
Papoulias said, emphasizing that the NATO decision on air 
strikes was made against the wishes of the Greek Government. 
  Replying to numerous questions which exclusively referred to 
the NATO threat against the Bosnian Serbs, the Greek foreign 
minister said that, according to the latest information, the 
process of withdrawing heavy weapons from the positions around 
Sarajevo in under way, which is cause for hope, and that he sees 
no reason for additional pressure on the Serbs. 
  "I believe, however, that the withdrawal of heavy weapons is 
not an obligation for the Bosnian Serbs alone. The same should 
be done by Bosnian Muslims," Papoulias said, adding: "Greek 
policy is well known -- all the warring sides in Bosnia must 
make the same concessions in order to restore peace and maintain 
the EU peace initiative. As a country that holds the EU 
presidency, Greece insists on this." 
  What will Athens do if, nevertheless, air strikes take 
place? 
  "We are doing everything in our power to avoid the spread of 
the war, because there is a real danger of the Bosnian crisis 
spreading south. Should that happen, it would mean a dramatic 
escalation of the conflict which would no longer be limited to 
the Balkans but would also be a European conflict, given the 
fact that nobody in that case could rule out the possibility of 
the involvement of third parties." 
  As EU president, is Greece is able to convene an urgent 
session of the EU ministers before the NATO ultimatum expires? 
  "Yes, this possibility exists and we are examining it," 
Papoulias briefly replied without going into details. 
  At the end of his news conference, the Greek foreign 
minister 
confirmed that the Belgian, German, and Greek foreign ministers 
will meet in Athens tomorrow and that Andrey Kozyrev will be 
joining them. 
  "This is the usual practice of the EU troika (the former, 
present and the future president), and dialogue with Russia fits 
into this. However, one of the issues to which we will devote 
attention will be the crisis in former Yugoslavia," Karolos 
Papoulias said.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias will tonight 
return from Belgrade where he held talks with the leadership of 
the new Yugoslavia in his capacity as the European Union [EU] 
Council of Ministers president and as the Greek foreign 
minister. Papoulias will meet Bosnian Serb leader Radovan 
Karadzic at 2100 today. 
  Papoulias said his talks in Belgrade were held in a warm 
atmosphere. Within the framework of the new Greek initiative to 
avert NATO intervention in Bosnia, Papoulias held talks with 
Serb President Slobodan Milosevic and said that both he and 
Milosevic ascertained that times are difficult but there is hope 
that worse might be avoided. He said: This will not only 
benefit Europe, but the Balkans too. 
  The foreign minister said the Greek Presidency is 
considering 
convening the EU Council of Ministers before the NATO ultimatum 
expires. Papoulias said the procedure to withdraw the heavy 
weaponry from Sarajevo is proceeding well and this is hopeful. 
But he noted that this is not solely the Serb side's 
responsibility and that the Muslims should do the same to save 
peace and the EU peace plan, on which the Greek side insists. 
  Asked if Greece will exercise its veto right at NATO against 
the air raids, Papoulias said Greece is considering using every 
available means to avert extensive clashes. The foreign 
minister said he and Milosevic discussed the possibility of the 
war spreading to the south, stressing that this would be a 
dramatic development -- the beginning of an armed clash that 
would have broader European dimensions. Papoulias said no one 
can rule out the participation of third forces. 
  Replying to another question, Papoulias said the Greeks in 
Serbia are safe. He said: They consider it their second home 
and there is no need to abandon it. Papoulias said citizens 
from other Western countries are evacuated following their 
countries' evaluations and decisions.

  [Excerpt] Belgrade, 16 Feb (TANJUG) -- Sinisa Vucinic, 
chairman of the Serb Royalist Movement [Srpski Rojalisticki 
Pokret, SRP], said in Belgrade today that if NATO launches air 
strikes on Bosnian Serb positions on 20 February, "a special 
unit of the SRP would attack UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] 
members in Belgrade." 
  He said that "the West should take this threat seriously" 
and 
that the SRP would carry out its threats regardless of the 
Serbian Interior Ministry's reaction. 
  Vucinic stressed that SRP members in Frankfurt were ready to 
"launch terrorist attacks on the German people" if air strikes 
were launched against Bosnian Serb positions. [passage omitted]

  [Text] On the occasion of the NATO ultimatum and the

Party of Serbian Unity [SSJ], has called on Serbian volunteers 
"to be prepared to again gather under the Serbian flag." 
  If a single bomb falls on the Serbian positions in Bosnia, 
it 
is said in yesterday's announcement, the SSJ will activate the 
military agreement with Zhirinovskiy's Liberal-Democratic Party 
and invite Russian volunteers. The SSJ warns that in case the 
war escalates, it will use the Russian secret weapon [the 
Elipton], obtained from Zhirinovskiy, against the aggressor's 
manpower and enemy aircraft.

<F P=106> [Article by Azem Hajdarevic: "Persecution of the Muslims"] </F>
  [Text] The state of "Yugoslavia" has intensively been 
using various methods of ethnic cleansing in Sandzak. Media 
propaganda, police repression, and permanent killing and 
kidnapping of the Muslims have played the most important role in 
that. 
  Through the Serbian and Montenegrin media, especially 
television and the daily press (POLITIKA EXPRES, VECERNJE 
NOVOSTI, POBJEDA...), the state is intensively spreading 
anti-Muslim propaganda. These state media misinform both the 
local and international public and cover up the dramatic 
position of the non- Serb population, especially the Muslims, in 
what is left of "Yugoslavia." 
  This is evident from many examples and we are providing but 
a 
few. 
  Twenty-five Muslims from Sandzak, from Novi Pazar, Sjenica, 
and Tutin, suspected of possessing illegal weapons, threatening 
the territorial integrity of the "FRY [Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia]," and creating an independent state of Sandzak were 
put on trial on 31 January 1994, eight months after the suspects 
had been arrested. During the pre-trial investigation, the 
media, especially POLITIKA EXPRES, published numerous articles 
and three features accusing the suspects of terrorism, 
secession, and Islamic fundamentalism. The authors published 
those articles and features in collusion with police directly to 
influence public opinion, which is against the law. The 
pretrial investigation was much longer than permitted by law, 
and the suspects were interrogated by the police and then by the 
investigating judge without having their lawyers present, but 
the media failed to mention all this. 
  Nor have the Serbian and Montenegrin media revealed the 
truth 
about how the suspects were treated when they were interrogated 
in Kraljevo prison, where they were tortured both physically and 
mentally in order to force a confession. 
<H5>  New "Standard Language" </H5>
  Suspects are charged under Article 116 of the Criminal Law 
of 
the "FRY," although that law does not exist in this 
"Yugoslavia," for it was enacted by the Assembly of the former 
Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia, so this law cannot 
apply. The attorneys of the arrested suspects, 12 of them, 
claim that this is a political show trial, that people cannot be 
tried for terrorist acts that they did not commit, but only for 
the illegal possession of weapons, which is again controversial, 
for it presents a one-sided application of the law for one 
section of the population, in this case the Muslims, and that is 
an obvious example of discriminatory policy in applying the law. 
  The following people were put to trial: Ibrahim Fakovic, 
Sefkija Rasljanin, Safet Zilkic, Hodo Jakupovic, Asim Sacirovic, 
Hajriz Fejzovic, Fadil Ugljanin, Jonuz Skrijelj, Adem Hasic, 
Dzemail Etemovic, Mersad Plojevic, Nusuf Halilovic, Murat Music, 
Alija Halilovic, Hajriz Kolasinac, Hajro Aljkovic, Mustafa Alic, 
Rifat Dupljak, Sefcet Gracanin, Zuhdija Hodzic, Nedzib Hodzic, 
all from Novi Pazar, Jakup Hodzic and Mirsad Hodzic from 
Sjenica, Semsudin Kucevic and Zekrija Hajrovic from Tutin. 
  For propaganda purposes, the media have also used the 
foreign 
policy activity of President of the Sandzak Muslim National 
Council Sulejman Ugljanin, which lasted for a couple of days 
during September and October, accusing him and the above people 
on the same grounds, reporting that an international arrest 
warrant has been issued by the Serbian authorities. 
  Another fine example of anti-Muslim propaganda is an event 
of 
27 December 1993, when the police raided the Zejnilovic family 
of Loznica in Bijelo Polje. The police shot Alen Zejnilovic and 
his mother Zurafeta, while his younger brother Adnan (17), 
sister Amela (18), and Mirela (19) were seriously injured. In 
order to justify this action of the police, the media presented 
the Zejnilovic family as terrorists. 
  Together with the media already mentioned, the local media 
of Novi Pazar, Bijelo Polje, and other Sandzak municipalities 
have also used disinformation to assist the exodus of Muslims: 
such as the Information Center of Bijelo Polje, which consists 
of BIJELOPOLJSKE NOVINE and the local radio station. Under the 
pretext of "using the standard language," they decided to 
abolish all terms, names, and expressions that are used by the 
Muslims or even resemble the culture, customs, tradition, and 
unique characteristics of the Muslims. On the other hand, 
chetnik songs and praise for the chetnik movement can be heard 
every day. 
  Persecution and genocide against the Muslims is presented as 
the just fight of the Serbs and the Montenegrins for Serbianity 
against "Islamic fundamentalism." Such propaganda encourages 
the Serbs and the Montenegrins to treat Muslims even more 
brutally, as is evident from the following examples: 
  On 7 January 1994, a group of armed Montenegrins dispersed 
all the Muslim tradesmen from the market in Pavino Polje and 
warned them not to return there again. 
  On 11 January 1994, in Gubavac in Bijelo Polje, three 
Montenegrins attempted to rape Sefka Bucan (25) in her back 
yard, and no measures were taken against them. 
<H5>  Ethnic Composition Is Changing </H5>
  In addition to media propaganda and satanization, the 
repression or, better still, the terrorism of the 
Serbian-Montenegrin authorities is another way to apply pressure 
to ethnically cleanse Sandzak of the Muslims. 
  Let us recall that, on 22 October 1992, under the auspices 
of 
the authorities, 17 Muslims from the village of Sjeverin in the 
Priboj commune were kidnapped and then killed near Visegradska 
Banja. 
  On 16 February 1993, 12 Muslims were kidnapped in Bukovica, 
in Pljevlja, among whom there were also two children, aged three 
and five, and they were then taken to Cajnici (in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina); six of them were exchanged and six returned 
to Pljevlja. During the kidnapping, Latif Bungur (95) was 
killed on the spot, although he was not buried until eight 
months later. 
  On 18 February 1993, in the village of Kukurovici in Priboj 
three people were killed: Bulut Huzeir, Husovic Musan, and 
Sarac Sadeta, and they have still not been given a decent burial. 
  On 27 February 1993, 20 Muslims and one Croat were kidnapped 
in Strpci from a train going from Belgrade to Bar and they are 
still missing today, in spite of all appeals. 
  In 1993, in the villages in Priboj and Pljevlja, 47 Muslim 
homes, three mosques, and several other buildings were burnt 
down or destroyed by explosives. In this area, 36 villages were 
ethnically cleansed and most were ransacked. 
  Increasing police repression is being recorded in Novi 
Pazar, 
Sjenica, and Tutin, where the Muslims form an overwhelming 
majority, and this has contributed to changing the ethnic 
situation in those Sandzak communes. In Tutin alone, in 1993 
the Serbian police raided 36 villages, arrested 68 people, and 
83 were brought in for so-called informative interrogations, of 
whom 57 were physically injured. 
  Even more severe repression during 1993 was observed around 
Sjenica, where 21 villages were raided (350 families were 
raided), 13 people arrested, 190 taken away for these so-called 
informative interrogations, and 250 sustained physical injuries. 
  Growing fear and uncertainty among Muslims is being caused 
by 
the opening of new police stations in these places. 
  For those reasons, the Muslims are fleeing the area in great 
numbers, especially to Western Europe, so that some 85,000 are 
now in exile. The program of the author of the "greater 
Orthodox Serbia" was designed to do exactly that. 
Unfortunately, even if we suppose that peace and security will 
return to these areas and that the so called FRY will become a 
democratic and rule-of-law state, the ethnic composition has 
already been changed, as historical and demographic indicators 
show that 20 to 30 percent of those who are in exile will never 
return to their native country. That means that Sandzak has, in 
any case, lost between 20,000 to 25,000 Muslims. 
  The only solution for the survival of the Muslims in Sandzak 
is for their indigenousness to be recognized and for the Sandzak 
region to be granted the right to its political and territorial 
uniqueness, something for which the people voted in the October 
1991 referendum.

  [Excerpts] Belgrade, 11 Feb (TANJUG) -- The Serbian 
Assembly this evening elected the following three candidates to 
the posts of vice president of the republic's parliament in the 
first round of voting: Vojislav Mihailovic (DEPOS [Democratic 
Movement of Serbia] and Serbian Renewal Movement), Vojislav 
Andric (DEPOS and New Democracy) and Djordje Basic (Democratic 
Party). Deputies Dragan Todorovic of the Serb Radical Party 
[Srpska Radikalna Stranka] and Vladan Batic of the Democratic 
Party of Serbia [Demokratska Stranka Srbije] failed to gain the 
necessary number of votes and subsequently withdrew their 
candidature. Simultaneously with withdrawing their candidate 
for vice president the Radicals also withdrew their members from 
23 asembly committees and ther candidates for the Chamber of the 
Republics of the Federal Assembly. [passage omitted] 
  After a brief break Serbian Assembly president Dragan Tomic 
said that the heads of the groups of deputies failed to nominate 
a candidate for the fourth vice president's position, so this 
election will take place at one of the next sessions. 
  The Serbian Assembly elected 16 of the 20 deputies to the 
Federal Assembly's Chamber of Republics -- nine from the 
Socialist Party of Serbia, four from DEPOS, two from the 
Democratic Party [DS], and one from the Democratic Community of 
Vojvodina Hungarians [DZVM]. 
  This group consists of Socialists Zoran Andjelkovic, 
Slobodan 
Babic, Radmilo Bogdanovic, Vojislav Zivkovic, Branka Jesic, 
Milivoje Miletic, Miroljub Mladenovic, Radovan Pankov and Zoran 
Sokolovic. The DEPOS federal deputies are Milan Bozic, Vuk 
Draskovic, Dusan Mihajlovic and Gvozden Rosic. The DS members 
of this group are Zoran Djindjic and Borivoje Radic. The DZVM 
deputy is Mihalj Secei. [passage omitted] 
  This evening the assembly re-elected Ljiljana Petkovic as 
general secretary of the parliament. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by D. Becirovic: "Zhirinovskiy: There Will Be No </F>
Bombing of Serbian Towns"] 
  [Text] "Do you believe that NATO will indeed attack the 
Serbs from the air?" Vladimir Zhirinovskiy was asked today at a 
news conference. 
  "This will not happen. They only want to affect the morale 
of 
the Serbs by threatening them. And if that should happen, there 
is a group of Russian officers in Europe who support me. They 
would use a secret weapon, unused thus far, which destroys any 
force in the air and on the ground, in order to cool off the 
Western heads that threaten attacks on peaceful towns in Bosnia. 
There will be no bombing whatsoever because they know very well 
how Napoleon and Hitler fared, and if they do not know we will 
once again show them," Zhirinovskiy said. 
  Asked what he thought about independent Montenegro, Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy stated that he believes that there should be two to 
three Orthodox states in the Balkans and that he opposes the 
creation of small states. "The West wants to introduce this in 
the Balkans in order to partition them. Because it wants to 
divide the Balkans: With Catholicism from the west and Turkey in 
the east, and the Germans would arrive from the north, Turkish 
and German would be spoken in the Balkans by the middle of the 
21st century. It will not be able to do so because the Balkans 
are the land of Orthodoxy, where Serbian and Russian will be 
spoken," Vladimir Zhirinovskiy predicts. Speaking about the 
strategy of the West, Zhirinovskiy also said the following: "The 
time will come when the Western politicians will be standing in 
line so that I may receive them." 
  Otherwise, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who came to Montenegro at 
the invitation of the Russian-Serbian Friendship Society, the 
Serbian National Renewal, and the Social Democratic Party of 
Montenegro, also talked this morning with a group of 
representatives of some opposition parties and was received by 
the secretary of the Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS), 
Svetozar Marovic. According to the information issued by 
Marovic's office, the guest was informed of the DPS efforts to 
resolve the conflict in the territory of the former Yugoslavia 
in a peaceful and democratic way, because the people are tired 
of wars and conflicts. 
  "We must fight for our religion, our spirit, and our mind in 
order to survive in this area. This is why we do this today as 
well, in spite of all the injustices, pressures, and decisions 
of the West. We remember that the Russian people were with us in 
the past, and they are with us today in spite of all the 
tribulations, and we expect to be together in the defense of 
what is ours," Marovic said. 
  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, strongly praising the contribution of 
the DPS in the resolution of the crisis in the territory of the 
former Yugoslavia, stressed that "the Russian policy in this 
respect did not always correspond adequately to the expectations 
of the peoples of Serbia and Montenegro," that the policy of his 
party consists of supporting the Slavs and resolving problems 
through peaceful means, and that his party will actively 
participate in the resolution of the crisis and do everything in 
order for the sanctions to be lifted as soon as possible. 
  At exactly 1300 hours in Ivan Milutinovic Square in 
Podgorica, a large assembly was held at which more than 1,000 
citizens were present. Greeted enthusiastically with shouts 
"Russians, Russians" and posters, saying, for example, 
"Priyekhal Petr Velikiy" [Russian for "Peter the Great has 
arrived"], Vladimir Zhirinovskiy addressed the citizens: "We do 
not threaten anyone, but one should know what Russian tanks and 
Russian airplanes are and who was the first to fly into the 
cosmos. Brother Serbs, Montenegrins, be proud to be Orthodox. We 
are both spiritually and economically richer. If they are 
forming the European Gommunity from London to Vienna, we will 
form the Eastern European Community from Knin to Crimea." 
  Offering all possible aid, as he said, to the heroic Serbian 
people, Zhirinovskiy added: "On Saturday, 5 February, I will 
personally organize a meeting in support of the Serbian people, 
and I will ask in the sharpest way in the Russian parliament for 
the resignation of minister-traitor Kozyrev." 
  "Only a short time remains before the leadership in Russia 
is 
removed. We will force it to remove the blockade in Yugoslavia 
and find a way to compensate the Serbs for the material losses 
they have suffered. We are obligated to take care of you more 
than anyone else. Let the war move on to Latin America, Africa, 
and the Far East," Zhirinovskiy said, among other things, at 
today's meeting in Podgorica, which was in a way spontaneous, 
because it was announced only late last night.

<F P=106> [Report by Branko Jokic: "Business Is Business"] </F>
  [Text] (From our correspondent) Podgorica, 28 January -- 
According to an article published in the Novi Pazar magazine 
SANDZAK, Montenegrin and Albanian authorities concluded a secret 
agreement on the export of gasoline from Albania to Montenegro, 
from where it is delivered to Pale [capital of the Srpska 
republic] to be used by the Bosnian Serb military. 
  According to the article, Montenegrin Albanians living along 
the Montenegrin-Albanian border are involved in the deals. Some 
of them have been licensed by the Montenegrin Government to 
"import" gasoline. Gasoline, which costs one German mark per 
liter in the Albanian town of Scutari, is transported in large 
quantities across Lake Skutari to Montenegro. The Yugoslav Army 
provides specially equipped boats. 
  The citizens of Montenegro involved in this business earn 
one-half mark per liter. Almost all local residents participate 
in this trade (actually it is a state-sanctioned smuggling 
operation) because of the high earnings. Montenegro and the 
Srpska republic are well supplied with gasoline. The Pizon 
Petrol Enterprise, owned by the former Crvena Zvezda soccer 
player Vladimir Petrovic Pizon, transports gasoline from Lake 
Scutari to Pale. 
  As reported, the Albanian authorities have recently 
tightened 
control over gasoline sales in Scutari, but it is a well-known 
secret that gasoline stations in Scutari work at full speed and 
sell almost half of all the gasoline sold in Albania. We are 
talking about very large quantities, knowing that last year 
Albanians registered several thousand vehicles that they had 
purchased at European junkyards. According to the article, Pale 
receives five to seven tanker-truck loads of Albanian gasoline 
each day. 
  In addition to Albania, Macedonia is also accused of 
sanctions violations. At the border crossings near Ohrid and 
Rozaj (on the Macedonian-Albanian and Montenegrin-Albanian 
borders), aluminum is exported from Montenegro and raw materials 
are imported for Montenegro and Serbia without hindrance. Heavy 
trucks and trailers wait for hours on both sides of the border 
crossings, which in the past were almost without traffic. 
  If all this is true, we could conclude that this type of 
border trade, uncontrolled by representatives of the 
international community, was agreed to by Momir Bulatovic and 
Sali Berisha when the Montenegrin president visited Tirana. At 
the same time, Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic paid a 
visit to Skopje. It is a fact that we can only guess now how 
Albania benefits. Maybe it is alleviation of discontent in the 
western part of the country, where at least some hundred local 
residents are earning good incomes trafficking in gasoline.

<F P=106> [Article by Jiri Hracek and Jiri Stastny: "Kalvoda and Pilip </F>
Disagree With Klaus and Advocate Military Intervention in 
Bosnia"] 
  [Text] Representatives of the Civic Democratic Alliance 
[ODA] and the Christian Democratic Party [KDS] yesterday 
rejected Prime Minister Klaus's statement about the government's 
disapproval of air intervention in Bosnia. According to the ODA 
Political Board, it is a tragic error to assume that, when 
diplomatic means become exhausted, it is wrong to resort to the 
use of force. 
  "This is the moment that has now come in the former 
Yugoslavia, and especially in Bosnia. We demand that our 
country support NATO's decision on vigorous military 
intervention in this area," says a statement issued by the 
ODA Political Board. ODA Chairman and Deputy Prime Minister Jan 
Kalvoda energetically raised their objections to Vaclav Klaus's 
statement of Wednesday [9 February]: "I am surprised by the 
information that the government is opposed to air strikes. If 
such a statement was made, I have to say that the government did 
discuss the issue, but without adopting any resolution." 
  In an interview for CESKY DENIK, KDS Chairman Ivan Pilip 
also 
reacted to yesterday's statement of Vaclav Klaus: "We all 
saw the Sarajevo marketplace. What is happening there is very 
unfair." [allusion to Klaus's remark that air strikes 
against Bosnian Serbs would be "unfair"] For two reasons, his 
party advocates intervention in former Yugoslavia. "First, from 
the viewpoint of political morality. The world is globally 
interlinked, which is particularly true of Europe. The world 
made a mistake by addressing this problem by means of indecisive 
wavering and resolutions. This approach has evidently 
contributed a great deal to the situation being the way it is 
now." Citing the second reason, Ivan Pilip said that, in the 
course of its history, our country has repeatedly been in a 
position when it needed closer links to the world. "Therefore, 
we should not approach these problems by arguing that everyone 
must settle them on his own," the KDS chairman added. 
  A statement approving of the NATO decision was issued 
yesterday also by the Club of Nonaligned Activists [KAN]. "We 
believe that, when women and children are being crippled and 
murdered, it is no longer war but genocide. Unlike Vaclav 
Klaus, we see precisely the shelling of the innocent as the 
unfair conduct of war," says the KAN statement.

Furthermore, I believe that the Alliance secretly assumed that 
the Serbs would take a positive stand on the withdrawal of their 
heavy military equipment," Czech Defense Minister Antonin Baudys 
said yesterday while visiting Dobruska. Replying to a question 
from the LIDOVE NOVINY reporter as to whether an emergency plan 
for our soldiers serving with UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] in 
former Yugoslavia had been drawn up, Antonin Baudys said: "Our 
troops are outside Bosnia-Herzegovina, in the area of the 
so-called Serbian Krajina. Should a conflict come about, the 
Czech side would proceed in the same way as the troops of other 
countries under UN command."

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] President of the Republic Vaclav 
Havel returned during the night from his eight-day official 
visit to India and Thailand. Czech radio correspondent David 
Stahlavsky, who accompanied the president during his trip, is in 
the studio now with more details. 
  [Stahlavsky] President Havel considers the visit to be a 
success. He reiterated this tonight shortly before landing at 
Old Ruzyne airport. He praised, in particular, the 
participation of Ivan Kocarnik, deputy prime minister and 
finance minister; Josef Zieleniec, minister of foreign affairs; 
and Radomir Sabela, deputy of the minister of industry and 
trade. They all agree with the president's assessment of the 
visit. [passage omitted] 
  Vaclav Havel made a brief unofficial stopover in Kuwait. He 
had private talks with the amir in power, Shaykh Jabir al-Ahmad 
al-Jabir al-Sabah. This is what the Czech president said about 
these talks: 
  [Begin recording] [Havel] The amir and I discussed political 
cooperation between our countries. We agreed that our views 
were very close and that no political shadows exist between us. 
We also discussed economic cooperation. I said that this 
cooperation is not as good as it could be, that unutilized 
potential exists in this respect. I explained the reasons we 
did not use this potential as best we could during the period 
that our entire economy was undergoing the process of 
transformation. The amir emphasized that Kuwait is very 
interested in economic cooperation with the Czech Republic and 
that our firms are well known in that country. An agreement 
between Kuwait and the Czech Republic on the protection of 
investments is due to be finalized and signed in the spring. 
[passage indistinct] [end recording] 
  [Announcer] It should be added that our trade with Kuwait 
amounted to approximately $5 million last year. Czech exports 
to Kuwait account for the best part of it, while Kuwaiti imports 
to the Czech Republic are very small.

<F P=106> [Article by Jaroslav Kmenta: "The Tamara Radar Could Monitor </F>
the Situation in the Middle East"] 
  [Text] Prague--The Czech radar, Tamara, which, according 
to the experts, can even detect the "invisible" U.S. Stealth 
aircraft, could participate in monitoring the situation in the 
Middle East. The manufacturer of this state-of-the-art air 
defense system offered it to the United Nations at the beginning 
of the year. 
  According to preliminary conjectures, the Tamara radar could 
be deployed in Cyprus. From this island, which is some 150 
kilometers from the coast of Lebanon, Israel, and other Middle 
Eastern states, the radar could monitor the airspace above this 
region. It could also partially monitor the transfer of 
military hardware on land and sea. Tamara has a range of up to 
450 kilometers. 
  Tamara can detect aircraft against which normal radar 
systems 
are ineffective. It is similar to the U.S. AWACS [Airborne 
Warning and Control System] early warning system. However, as 
opposed to active radar systems, which emit radio waves into the 
atmosphere and assess their reflections, Tamara only receives 
radio impulses from the atmosphere. 
  Ludek Stodulka, vice president of the HTT Group, which 
produces the radar, told us that Tamara can detect air-defense 
systems and the precise coordinates of missiles, airfields, and 
warning systems. It can differentiate between the false and real 
locations of military hardware. It can distinguish types of 
aircraft, missiles, ships, and radars at great distances. 
  According to Stodulka, the Czech Foreign Ministry has 
described the company's initiative as encouraging. However, the 
appropriate UN offices have not yet responded to the HTT Group's 
offer. In the opinion of Army experts, the deployment of the 
Tamara system would have forestalled such tragedies as the 
shooting down of flight KAL-007 in 1983 by a former Soviet 
fighter bomber or the shooting down of the A-300 passenger 
aircraft by a U.S. Navy missile over the Persian Gulf. 
  Stodulka said that the HTT Group would like to apply to the 
Association for Czech Republic Quality Awards to grant the 
system a Czech Made trademark.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Martin Danes; </F>
place and date not given: "He Who Whips the Cream Before Baking 
the Cake Does Not Get Far"] 
  [Text] The topic of the Czech Republic's 
international relations that has been raised ever more 
frequently recently is free trade. In our regular interview 
with the prime minister, we deal mainly with this issue. 
  [Danes] Ministers of four Central European Free Trade 
Association (CEFTA) signatory states issued a statement in 
Prague last week, according to which the deadline for CEFTA 
implementation should be moved forward from eight to five years. 
Are you satisfied with this result, or do you believe that the 
term could have been even shorter and the trade spectrum wider? 
  [Klaus] These are two different things: There is an 
official communique and the actual topic of the talks. What 
the ministers just signed has actually been discussed throughout 
the last year. The Czech side has exerted exceptional pressure 
to this effect. I had to step in several times and push the 
prime ministers of Poland and Hungary, who, fortunately, hold a 
somewhat different view from the trade ministers of those 
countries, and therefore it was possible to bring this issue to 
a successful conclusion. Thus, it was in fact just a formal 
signing of something that had been agreed upon on the level of 
deputy ministers before the end of 1993. 
  Something else was the real topic of the Prague meeting: to 
progress again a bit further. This time, too, we pushed for a 
further acceleration of the implementation of the free trade 
zone, unconditionally supported by the Slovak side. The 
opinions no longer coincide here. Hungary and Poland demand 
numerous advantages for themselves and are not interested in 
speeding up the process. I consider it very bad because the 
CEFTA agreement on free trade is the core of our cooperation 
with these three countries and not some superficial 
proclamations or formal political gestures. Hence, my feelings 
are mixed. 
  [Danes] What is our starting point? 
  [Klaus] Our country does not want to be protectionist. I 
made arrangements recently for a substantial acceleration of the 
work on a free trade zone with Estonia, and we have reached an 
agreement this week with Israeli Prime Minister Rabin on the 
plan to do the same in the near future. We are simply 
interested in free trade. If we say this in the direction of the 
West, it is absolutely clear that it is our duty to speak at the 
same volume in addressing the East. 
  [Danes] Are these steps towards breaking down the trade 
barriers a part of some broadly based international political 
concept? 
  [Klaus] Everything must be placed in a much more general 
framework. In Central and East Europe but also in West Europe, 
the feeling gained prominence that integration equals 
integration of institutions. That is a completely wrong idea 
and confuses the issue. Integration does not at all have to be 
an institutional integration. It could be based on a simple 
breaking down of the trade barriers and opening borders. This 
way, every citizen is integrated with a citizen in the 
neighboring country, every businessman is integrated with a 
businessman abroad, every consumer benefits from having on the 
table a product from another country, etc. We really need to 
make room for interhuman relations in all spheres. What formal 
integrational steps the states have to take is only the icing on 
the cake and not the essential part. If we whip the cream 
before we bake the cake, as is the case in numerous 
integrational attempts around the world, we will not get far. 
  Of course, the central evidence of people is only a 
technical 
modality of the entire process. I must go back to that whipping 
cream and cake: It simply is not possible to jump into 
something head first, if the essence is lacking. We know very 
well that numerous European countries have suddenly been 
discovering that charity begins at home, that they are French 
before they are inhabitants of the European Community. For this 
reason, the national card is being drawn much more often than 
one would expect, based on the statements of particular 
politicians in the past. 
  [Danes] Do you believe that the physical removal of borders 
in West Europe is premature? 
  [Klaus] A border as a barrier, wire, fence--i.e., tangible, 
palpable, which must be crawled under or climbed over--is one 
thing. It is another thing completely when the border is a 
rather symbolic affair. I believe that the borders that are 
100-percent located in Europe will remain just symbolic borders, 
and that as long as can be foreseen. The fact that the borders 
in the sense of a tangible thing keep disappearing is a matter 
of course. Thus the borders in the former sense have been and 
will be disappearing--that is a continuous and natural 
process--and I believe that the borders in the latter sense of 
the word will also disappear. 
  [Danes] There has been a lot of discussion lately about 
the statements made by Deputy Jiri Payne in the United States 
regarding the list of [former State Security] agents published 
in NECENZUROVANE NOVINY. A general question comes to mind: To 
what degree can a representative of the government majority 
publicly present his own personal views that are not identical 
with the official position of the government? 
  [Klaus] I have not conducted any detective investigation as 
to what degree the statements of Deputy Payne are authentic and 
to what degree they were enhanced by the media. I, for 
instance, was cited by all kinds of world media recently as 
having said in Davos that, after a stagnation in our country, 
economic growth will follow. I would never let the word 
"stagnation" pass my lips. It was by no means stagnation that 
took place in our country but, rather, an entirely different 
process of ridding ourselves of the ballast of absurd production 
that could have existed only in the centrally planned regime. 
  Therefore, I will stay with a general answer. We live in a 
democracy, and we cannot order people to hold identical views on 
everything. I do not take this as a formal question but, 
rather, as a specific, fact-finding one. I am rather depressed 
if several ministers announce in advance how they are going to 
vote. I consider it against the esprit de corps. If the result 
of the vote is 10:9 or 6:13, I do not even need to explain the 
outcome--who was in favor and who opposed--to anybody. I am 
sorry that it is done. The same applies to the alleged 
statements by Deputy Payne. 
  On the other hand, we must strictly differentiate between an 
official statement by a politician at a news conference and 
statements made in a two-hour discussion with an audience of 
500, when willy-nilly--we are all just people of flesh and 
blood--we succumb to a certain degree to the atmosphere, the 
environment, and we are more relaxed, do not use crystal-clear 
sentences as we would do in an official communique. At an 
informal discussion with expatriates, it can easily happen that 
you speak about something significant for 90 percent of the 
time, and then someone asks a question, to which you reply with 
a relatively imprecise, unclear answer, and this answer will 
suddenly dominate in the media. I try to avoid this myself but 
am aware that one can never avoid it altogether.

<F P=106> [Interview with Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy </F>
by Pavel Paral; place and date not given: "I Do Not Advocate 
the Asian Tigers' Principle for This Country"] 
  [Text] [Paral] The government forecasts economic growth 
of 2-3 percent this year, while the Czech National Bank [CNB] 
anticipates 2 percent at most. These figures seem rather small 
to me considering that they are seen as a turning point in 
economic development. Apparently, all the basic things in 
reform have been done. 
  [Dlouhy] Are you sure that everything has been done? 
  [Paral] The prime minister declared recently that reform was 
over. 
  [Dlouhy] We will certainly still get round to enterprise 
management, enterprises that have gone through coupon 
privatization, the role of the privatization funds, and the real 
state of relations between the owner and management. This is 
all just in the process of being defined and will be defined. 
On the other hand, I would not make an issue out of the 
differences between the government's estimate and that of the 
CNB. Bankers everywhere are, by nature, more skeptical than 
politicians, who "must" instill optimism. 
  [Paral] I am not making an issue out of it. It is just that 
the two estimates seem low to me. 
  [Dlouhy] If 2-percent growth is achieved, it will be a very 
good result, and I will consider it a real success. However, 
this is conditional on several facts. First and foremost, on 
whether the current dynamism of exports can be maintained. It 
will also depend, in the annual context, on how 1993 turned out. 
I said in July that the second half of the year would be worse 
and that we should expect decline. I was criticized for this, 
but we had a decline in the third quarter--for a rather prosaic 
reason. The third quarter of 1992 was so high that the 
year-to-year comparison simply had to be worse. 
  On the other hand, the first quarter of 1993 was very low, 
so 
the first quarter of this year may be high. This is what 
reporters have said, after all. So, when growth is being 
considered, statistical issues play a role. 
  It is also of no fundamental importance whether economic 
growth this year is 1 or 2 or 2.5 percent. On the other hand, 
what is of fundamental importance is the fact that the trend in 
the gross domestic product [GDP] is from - 14.2 percent in 1991 
to - 7.1 percent in 1992, zero in 1993, and + 1.8 or + 2.2 
percent in 1994, which not even RUDE PRAVO, which is associated 
more with the opposition political parties, can overlook as 
successful economic development. 
  Growth will depend on the dynamism of exports. I have to 
mention that, from the point of view of the UN European Economic 
Commission, for instance, the Czech Republic was the only former 
communist country that recorded an increase in exports. In view 
of the figures already referred to, further growth in the first 
quarter is virtually certain. Furthermore, we can expect growth 
in real domestic demand, both in investments and in households' 
consumption. 
  [Paral] In your opinion, then, is this year going to be a 
real turning point in the Czech economy's performance? 
  [Dlouhy] You always use shock therapy terminology. Why do 
you always expect a turning point? I like this trend, - 1.1 in 
1990, then - 14.2, - 7.1, and 0, and now it is improving 
slowly and, in time, cyclical fluctuations will become the norm. 
Would you want economic development like this? (Vladimir Dlouhy 
draws a V-shaped graph) 
  [Paral] Yes. 
  [Dlouhy] I do not advocate the Asian Tigers' principle for 
this country. 
  [Paral] Do you think that, after such a profound decline, 
growth rates between 2 and 3 percent are acceptable for this 
country? 
  [Dlouhy] Let us be realists in 1994 and 1995. The basic 
building blocks for a market economy have been laid in a 
rudimentary form here and, from this point of view, we are 
really a market economy. However, from the point of view of 
privatization, we see that small private enterprises are the 
only effective segment. This applies to only a few of the large 
enterprises, and a number of them will still undergo 
restructuring under the management of new owners. Nevertheless, 
they will also undergo a certain learning process, how to own 
and manage properly, which is, without a doubt, a bit of an 
impediment. Therefore, I do not anticipate particularly rapid 
growth for the next two years. It will then depend on the kinds 
of lessons this country learns and on the external conditions. 
Given a sensible economic policy, we can then achieve greater 
economic growth. I repeat, however, that I have never claimed 
that we can become an Asian Tiger. Nevertheless, if I am 
mistaken, all the better. 
  [Paral] We have a Polish neighbor, however, who has 
conducted a very similar economic policy, apart from 
privatization, and recorded a growth rate of approximately 4 
percent last year and expects to do the same this year. 
  [Dlouhy] Of course, the situation is a little different in 
Poland. You have to realize that they have a different 
situation as far as their debt, inflation, and other 
macroeconomic indexes are concerned. Apart from this, I feel 
that there is a danger of the economy in Poland overheating. 
All the data tells me that we did well when we embarked on a 
path of maximum macroeconomic stabilization. Now, of course, 
while maintaining stability, we are looking for growth as fast 
as possible. If it is 2 percent next year, thank God. 
  [Paral] Are the Poles not achieving higher growth because 
they have also paid more attention to structural changes? 
  [Dlouhy] We compiled special industrial figures for the 
first three quarters of 1993. We can elicit a specific change 
in the structure from these figures. Industry is contracting. 
This is not a tragedy, however. After all, we said that 
industry has to be reduced in size. Of course, it must not 
disappear into a black hole, but it is quite in order for 
industry to be reduced in size from the point of view of the 
number of employees and from the point of view of its proportion 
of the GDP. This is a natural restructuring process. 
  The issue here mainly involves whether restructuring is 
taking place during a period of decline. An average of 
35,000-40,000 people per month are made redundant in our 
country. Despite this, the unemployment rate is rising 
relatively slowly. This means that the majority of these people 
find a new job immediately. At the same time, I see changes in 
the cost structure, in productivity, and in employment away from 
heavier branches such as metallurgy, the power-generating 
industry, and bulk chemicals toward general engineering and 
certain branches of light industry. Therefore, I am able to 
argue that slowly but surely changes are taking place. 
  [Paral] Don't you think that branches such as heavy 
engineering should be shaped and restructured according to 
demand? After all, they know that we have to build roads and 
highways, reconstruct railroads, and modernize the telephone 
network and that materials and equipment are necessary for this. 
  [Dlouhy] Am I preventing the managements of these firms from 
making the predictions you mention? I sincerely hope that they 
are making them. If they are not doing this, they are bad 
managements. 
  [Paral] But the government has a very stepmotherly attitude 
toward these projects? 
  [Dlouhy] This is not true. Last year, especially in the 
second half of it, was the first time we said something more 
conceptual about the infrastructure. You have to realize that 
we inherited a divided state. A strategy was devised in the 
second half of the year to construct a highway network before 
the year 2005. By the way, the Bavarian industry minister told 
me that it is clear to him that we will complete the highway 
from Prague to Rozvadov in 1997, but they will not complete 
their 35 kilometers from Amberg until the year 2000. This means 
that these projects do not proceed so fast even in Germany. We 
now know that the Prague-Berlin, Breclav-Vienna, and 
Nuremberg-Prague railroad routes will be constructed. Other 
issues are also under discussion. Tenders are being issued for 
the Ingolstadt oil pipeline. The fundamental trends in the 
upgrading of telecommunications are also obvious. No company is 
being prevented from structuring itself in accordance with 
anticipated demand. 
  [Paral] I have heard that only half of the budget resources 
intended for investment were drawn on last year. 
  [Dlouhy] I do not know these figures by heart. If this were 
indeed the case, it would not be due to unwillingness on the 
part of the government. I have not come across a case whereby 
the Finance Ministry has not wanted to apportion the funds 
projected by the state budget for investments. If this is the 
case, it means that these projects were not ready. 
  [Paral] As far as I am aware, your opinion of the budget was 
somewhat different from the current budget concept asserted by 
the Finance Ministry. Do you think that the budget also has to 
be balanced in the short term? 
  [Dlouhy] It depends on whether you look as this issue as the 
trade and industry minister or as the finance minister. If I 
were finance minister, I would work for a constantly balanced 
budget. As industry minister, I like the idea of expenditure 
temporarily exceeding revenue with its possibilities for 
rejuvenating the economy and for facilitating the opposite ratio 
between income and revenue in the future. The problem is that 
few people have recorded such development in the history of 
advanced countries. This is an argument against my point of 
view. The Reagan policy began well in this regard in 1981, 
then, under political pressure following the deployment of SS-20 
missiles, the United States had to increase its armaments, and 
the potential budget surplus was nullified in this process. 
  Despite this, I would at least leave it open to discussion 
that it is unnecessary to be afraid of a sensible deficit if it 
really has the effect of economic growth. On the other hand, 
the question is to what extent our economy is ready for such 
stimuli. To what extent the businessman is capable of using tax 
relief, the foreign investor will really use such relief for our 
development, and so on. The question is, what effect would a 
greater volume of state orders and so on have on demand? We 
could take the prime minister at his word here. If we have 
indeed laid the foundations of the market economy, we should 
begin to believe more in the progrowth effect of the budget 
deficit. 
  [Paral] Now, of course, enterprises both private and state 
are grappling with the fact that they have no money. The reason 
is widespread insolvency. However, they have not been provided 
with sufficient capital since the era of state ownership. 
  [Dlouhy] This is a combination of several problems. The 
first is the problem of primary and secondary insolvency. A 
number of people have expressed opinions that insolvency should 
begin to be perceived as a specific business credit. I am not 
saying that insolvency has ceased to be a problem to me. It is 
enforced, whereas business credit is voluntary. 
  [Paral] I think the fact that the enterprise cannot afford 
this is an even greater problem. It cannot afford to defer 
payment because it would not have anything to make purchases 
with. 
  [Dlouhy] But this is also because the banks do not want to 
give it anything because it is in a poor financial situation, 
and it is in a poor financial situation because the firms it 
supplies do not pay it. Low capitalization is associated with 
the level of savings--how people and companies are able to make 
a profit and how they are willing to turn it into capital. We 
have too short a time behind us for this. A number of 
businesses are making a loss. Only a few businesses make such a 
large profit that they can immediately invest it. Credit is 
also accessible to only a limited circle of enterprises. There 
is no long-term financing or long-term credit in this country. 
After all, RUDE PRAVO should be closer to Marx--from the point 
of view of membership in political parties--than I am. If 
something is perfectly described in Das Kapital, then 
it is, in the first volume, the original accumulation of 
capital. This is quite relevant from the point of view of the 
Czech economy in the 1990's. In England, the original 
accumulation of capital took decades, and, although the 
situation is now completely different, we had an incredibly 
undernourished economy here after 40 years, an economy that has 
even received a couple of blows from outside--for example, the 
collapse of traditional markets and the recession in Europe. 
  There is another reason we will not emulate the Asian 
Tigers: 
South Korea and Taiwan tightened their belts and created a 
capital basis to the detriment of the population's standard of 
living. This cannot be implemented in our country. So, in our 
country, the 1990's will be a period of forming capitalization. 
All of this will still lead to many changes in the structure of 
the economy and to changes in employment. By saying this, I am 
not imparting pessimism. This is sober and real optimism, 
which, however, forces me to accept that our enterprises are 
under capitalized, that it is difficult for them to gain access 
to finance, and that this is associated with a whole bundle of 
problems that will begin to be unwrapped gradually. 
  [Paral] In the wake of coupon privatization, a large number 
of enterprises are in the hands of the major investment funds, 
and it is not in their interest to increase the enterprise's 
capital. The fund is interested in having a good enterprise in 
its portfolio and not in helping an enterprise in difficulty. 
When an enterprise finds itself in trouble, the fund sells its 
shares and buys others and does not extricate it from the mess. 
What are your experiences? 
  [Dlouhy] Naturally, there are a great many problems here. 
In part, in the actual execution of ownership. There are 
difficulties in administration, management, supervision of it, 
in some places outright gold-digging by means of membership on 
boards, collecting royalties, and so on. 
  You say that in advanced countries the funds try to sell an 
enterprise in difficulty. In this advanced economy--and the 
more so in our country--they also try to restructure and revive 
this enterprise before they sell it. We said that the state 
will do this only in exceptional cases. The new owners should 
do this. The funds will be in a situation where they will have 
good and bad enterprises and where they will inherit large 
holding companies--for instance, Aero. To sell them, they will 
have to be restructured. A bad enterprise will be divided. The 
completely inefficient part will be declared bankrupt, and the 
remainder will be kept or sold. What is happening is not 
evidence of a poorly chosen means of privatization. 
  I personally place greater emphasis on the issue of 
executing 
ownership rights. It is not that people do not know how to make 
strategic decisions. The problem is putting such a decision into 
effect--both from the point of view of the supervisory council 
and the owner and the board and the director general. This is 
where I see the weakest element. The issue does not so much 
involve the managers--we have good ones--but the method of 
supervising them, encouraging them, and their sometimes 
unnecessarily high salaries.

<F P=106> [Article by "tma": "Prices Rose Almost 2 Percent in </F>
January"] 
  [Text] Prague--Consumer prices rose 1.9 percent in 
January. While food prices remained virtually unchanged, 
compared with December 1993, there were marked increases in 
housing rents, water and sewage rates, the cost of heat, 
municipal transport fares, and other services. 
  Payments for housing rents and related services rose 30 
percent in the course of a single month. This was made possible 
by the government's decision to partially liberalize regulated 
prices in this area. A similar situation pertains to the cost 
of heat and hot water supply, which is almost 16 percent higher 
than in December 1993. Gasoline prices went up 2 percent, 
chiefly as a result of a change in the consumer tax rate. These 
systemic interventions alone led to 0.8-percent price growth. 
  These systemic changes were compounded in January by other 
extraordinary influences. A number of newspapers and magazines 
raised their prices, for example. Overall, these onetime 
changes brought a price growth of over 1 percent. 
  Compared with January 1993, consumer prices are now 10.9 
percent higher. The lowest has been the growth in food prices, 
which went up by less than 5 percent [since January 1993].

<F P=106> [Interview with Interpol Director General Raymond Kendall by </F>
Vladimir Sevela in Strasbourg; date not given: "According To 
the Interpol Chief, the Drugs Mafia in Europe Is Winning"] 
  [Text] Strasbourg--Interpol Director General Raymond 
Kendall declared in the Council of Europe last week that the 
methods employed so far to combat the organized drug trade have 
failed. He said that, despite the efforts by police forces 
throughout the continent, the drugs mafias have become 
consolidated during the past three years, and the aggression 
shown by their organizations has also increased. 
  The Interpol chief appealed to European countries to 
incorporate their security and information services into the 
struggle against international drug mafias and to utilize all 
the potential left behind in this sphere following the collapse 
of the Iron Curtain. "Let us proceed from the fact that the 
organized drug mafia is a foreign power set against the state. 
The current deployment of forces and resources between them and 
the police is uneven; therefore, it is necessary to apply other 
courses of action," he said. 
  Kendall also said that drug-related crime is now spreading 
dramatically throughout East Europe. Russia, Poland, and the 
Baltic states have become the main European producers of 
psychotropic substances, which are beginning to be the most 
sought-after drugs. According to Interpol figures, several 
times more heroin was seized in Bulgaria and Hungary last year 
than in the countries with a long "tradition" of using 
it--France and Belgium. 
  Because the drug problem is affecting the Czech Republic 
increasingly, MLADA FRONTA DNES asked Raymond Kendall for an 
interview. 
  [Sevela] How are politicians responding to your appeal to 
use the intelligence services in the struggle against the drug 
trade? 
  [Kendall] At the moment, it is too early for me to outline 
any specific reactions because this entire idea is, in essence, 
new. First of all, it is necessary for government and political 
officials to understand the seriousness of the threat 
represented by organized crime in the drug trade and to be aware 
of the kind of resources that it is necessary to use. I think, 
however, that they are aware of the benefit that will arise from 
combining efforts in an assault on these criminal organizations. 
Then, it is necessary to put the security services--this 
massive apparatus for acquiring and analyzing information--at 
the immediate disposal of the authorities involved in the 
struggle against drugs. 
  [Sevela] Some politicians maintain, however, that the 
security and information services are already being used for 
this purpose.... 
  [Kendall] Yes, but intelligence centers always have a 
tendency to act independently. According to my proposal, they 
should not operate separately and in isolation. They should be 
subordinate to the people supervising the struggle against 
drugs-related crime. 
  [Sevela] It is possible somehow to prevent corruption in the 
offices intended to combat the drug trade? 
  [Kendall] Your question touches upon one of the biggest 
problems. Organized crime is a source of huge profit and brings 
with it the possibility of corruption among officials in all 
posts, including the most senior ones. Therefore, it is 
important for all countries--but mainly those whom corruption 
most concerns--to introduce specific measures. 
  [Sevela] You yourself are an advocate of balance between 
repression and prevention in the drug sphere. You have proposed 
orienting efforts toward restricting the demand for narcotics. 
Should East Europe proceed differently from West Europe? 
  [Kendall] No, this problem is the same everywhere. Despite 
this, the countries of the former Eastern bloc are, to a certain 
extent, lucky because the majority of people there cannot afford 
the prices the traffickers demand for drugs. Another aspect is 
that many things from West Europe, including drugs, are 
attractive, especially to young people. Of course, it is 
possible to avoid the problems that afflict us by means of 
prevention. It is enough to learn from our experience, first 
and foremost, in restricting the demand for drugs and to try to 
stop them infiltrating into the country--something that is on 
the increase--until your economy improves. 
  [Sevela] In what direction should prevention be oriented? 
  [Kendall] It is simply necessary to explain to people that 
drugs are bad. It is necessary to explain the health risks from 
these dangerous toxic substances as is being done for tobacco 
and alcohol.

<F P=106> [Interview with Slovak Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac by </F>
an unidentified announcer in Bratislava--live] 
  [Excerpts] [Announcer] The Slovak Government was in session 
in Bratislava today. Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac and 
Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik left the session very early, 
about half an hour after the beginning. I have Roman Kovac in 
the studio. Can you tell us, how did the prime minister ask you 
to leave the government session? 
  [Kovac] The prime minister accused us both at the beginning 
of this session of various deeds. He wanted to split the 
session into two parts. In the first part, various 
privatization projects were to be approved, and we were to take 
part in it. In the second part, he wanted to discuss, without 
us, the internal political situation. 
  Moravcik's attempt to deny the accusations was not 
successful. It is true this was in keeping with the agenda of 
the government session. I, however, still think that his words 
could be given a hearing. We have asked for permission to 
depart from the session because the prime minister was directly 
asking us to go--so we actually complied with his wishes. 
  [Announcer] You are still members of the government. 
Therefore, this is anticonstitutional. 
  [Kovac] The government can be in session if more than half 
of 
its members are present. On the other hand, members of the 
government have the right to take part in its whole session. 
Therefore, his comment that they will hold a session without our 
presence really contradicts the way the government should act. 
I think that this was also one of the reasons we left the 
session. It was obviously a session about us but without us. 
  [Announcer] In the press club today, the prime minister 
accused you of forming a conspiratorial group and of working 
against the government, against the Movement [for a Democratic 
Slovakia (HZDS)]. Could you tell us something about this? 
  [Kovac] The expression "conspiratorial group" is very 
strong. 
I am happy to explain how the idea has come into being. It 
seemed absurd at first. It was mentioned on a number of 
occasions--the prime minister also mentioned it--that the 
opposition wants a government without him, and asked why then 
not without the top representatives of the other political 
parties, too. Parliament is not able to pass decisions due to 
controversies within it. Therefore, the idea has arisen to 
create a government that would represent the broad spectrum of 
the political forces in parliament, which would make parliament 
functional, and whether this government could not be formed 
without the top representatives of the parliamentary parties. 
What is now called a conspiratorial group or conspiratorial 
talks were, in fact, consultations because this idea was not 
easily acceptable to the other parties, and we would have no 
chance to present this idea without knowing whether they were 
willing to consider it. This is why we conducted these 
consultations. After some time, the parliamentary parties said 
that the idea was viable, in the interests of enabling the 
government and the state to function--as parliament was not able 
not operate. 
  It is certain that early parliamentary elections is the most 
democratic solution. I am fully for the elections because the 
citizens should decide in what way the country is to be ruled. 
There is, however, the period before early elections when there 
is a threat that fighting in parliament will continue. The 
state cannot come to a halt. [passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] The prime minister is to submit to the president 
the proposal for your dismissal tomorrow. It might happen that 
the president will sign it. You are deputy not to the Slovak 
parliament but to the former federal parliament. Have you 
thought of your political future? 
  [Kovac] [passage omitted] I have envisioned that the 
reaction 
to our proposal might be strong, as our proposal is rather 
unusual. I, however, did not think that it would be that strong. 
We have submitted our view, and it was immediately followed by 
the expulsion, the condemnation, and now by the proposal to 
resign from the government. 
  I have said more than once that I will not resign because 
that would mean admitting guilt. I do not see expressing an 
alternative view on the system of government or on solving a 
political crisis as being guilty of something. It is a view 
that can be right or wrong, but this does not mean working 
against the government. In a parliamentary system, the 
government must be seeking the confidence of parliament. If it 
is unable to get the majority in parliament, something needs to 
be done. 
  I am not aware of any shortcomings in my work as deputy 
prime 
minister; I was not criticized for any errors that would force 
me to admit that I did my work badly. If, however, the prime 
minister lost confidence in me and is unable to cooperate with 
me, is it his right to propose my future political destiny? I 
presume I will remain in political life. I remain a member of 
the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia. My expulsion 
contravenes the statutes of this Movement. The Movement has a 
rectifying mechanism, and I will do everything to use it because 
I think that the Movement is based on democracy. In democracy, 
people can express their views freely, and they cannot be 
punished for it. I am convinced that we will be able to defend 
and justify our views and that the expulsion will be nullified.

<F P=106> [Report on a news conference by Slovak President Michal </F>
Kovac at the Borik Hotel in Bratislava on 15 February by 
correspondents Magda Pospisilova and Zuzana Stukovska; passages 
within quotation marks recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Today, 365 days have passed since 
the National Council [of the Slovak Republic--the Slovak 
Parliament] elected the first president of the independent 
Slovak Republic. On this occasion, Michal Kovac met journalists 
at the Borik Hotel in Bratislava. Our editors Magda Pospisilova 
and Zuzana Stukovska were at the news conference. 
  [Stukovska] As expected, the majority of questions asked by 
journalists concerned Slovakia's internal political crisis. 
Commenting on the current situation, the president said that it 
might bring about a certain denouement, or at least a temporary 
one. He expects that an agreement to call early parliamentary 
elections will be reached. This might, according to Kovac, calm 
our society to a certain extent. [passage omitted] 
  Because the 26th session of the National Council is to 
resume 
tomorrow [16 February], our colleague Magda Pospisilova asked 
the following question: 
  [Pospisilova] Mr. President, if parliament passes a vote of 
no-confidence in the coalition government and the HZDS [Movement 
for a Democratic Slovakia] parliamentary group goes into 
opposition, what conditions will you set for agreeing to lead 
the Cabinet, or what are your criteria for selecting someone to 
whom you would ask to form an interim government? 
  [Kovac] "There is no way I intend to lead the government. 
This is out of question. As far as these criteria are 
concerned, I want to hold talks with all representatives, above 
all with HZDS representatives, to ask them to remain in 
government and to propose somebody else [for the post of prime 
minister]. I will concentrate my attention on this. 
  "If we fail to convince the HZDS representatives, following 
an agreement with other representatives of parliamentary 
political parties and movements, I will look for someone 
prepared to be asked to form a government." 
  [Pospisilova] Journalists went on to ask: The foreign 
minister, whose current position is extraordinary, is supposed 
to accompany you on the planned visit to Austria. Do you think 
the complications are accidental? 
  [Kovac] "I think that these things are not connected. I 
firmly believe that, at the time when the visit is to take 
place, the foreign minister will be able to accompany me." 
  [Pospisilova] Two early elections dates have been mentioned: 
June and November 1994. Which of them is favored by the 
president, and what sort of government should be ruling Slovakia 
before the elections? 
  [Kovac] "With regard to the debate, I think that the 
majority 
of the parties favor November. I do not want to get involved in 
this because this is really the business of the political 
entities, but, on the basis of what I was able to find out so 
far, I think that this [November] would be the optimal choice. 
If a vote of no-confidence in the government was passed before 
November, it would certainly be most suitable to have a broad 
coalition government of all parliamentary parties and movements. 
This government should prepare a number of bills that need to 
be passed by the government." [passage omitted] 
  [Pospisilova] The next question is from Radiozurnal. Mr. 
President, it is known that relations between Prime Minister 
Klaus and President Havel are not ideal, but no one says that 
their relationship could damage the state's interests. This 
cannot be said about Slovakia. Do you think that relations will 
be the same between Neuwirth and Carnogursky [both of the 
Christian Democratic Party] or Weiss and Ftacnik [of the 
Movement for a Democratic Left]? 
  [Kovac] "I do not know whether it will be, but, in any case, 
it is a pity because the lack of proper relations between the 
president and the prime minister can be negatively reflected in 
internal policy and also in foreign policy. This depends on 
personalities. To speak for myself, I have no pangs of 
conscience. I feel no share of guilt for the state of this 
relationship, and I do not know what I can do to improve it. I 
do not seek controversy, I am not conceited, I am cooperative 
and ready to cooperate. I am really vexed with this situation. 
I do not know what I can do apart from resigning." 
  [Pospisilova] Have you received such an offer in the 
interests of improving relations? President Kovac's reply to 
this question was the last at this news conference. 
  [Kovac] "No, I have not, and I do not intend to resign 
either. I was only mentioning it as a theoretical possibility, 
but I do not think the situation requires it. I see it as my 
duty to stay until the end, as long as my health allows me to do 
so, because I am becoming convinced that it is necessary to have 
patience, not to give up, to bring integrating and unifying 
elements into our society. As long as I am even slightly 
successful in this, it is my duty to continue in this policy."

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Good evening from the Hotel Danube. 
This is a direct relay of the discussion program "Pressclub." 
Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, Health Minister Irena 
Belohorska, and Minister of Labor, Social Affairs, and Family 
Olga Keltosova are here to report on the results of the 84th 
meeting of the Slovak Government today. 
  As you know, the government today followed an amended 
agenda. 
Most points were left out of the agenda, and the session 
concentrated on the assessment and endorsement of privatization 
projects and a statement on the current internal political 
situation. We want to concentrate on both. [passage omitted] 
  What stance has been assumed by the government today on the 
current situation, and what solutions can you envisage? 
  [Meciar] [passage omitted] The Government of the Slovak 
Republic therefore proposes that this election period be 
shortened by half and that it end by 30 June 1994. It is 
submitting a bill of the constitutional law to the Slovak 
parliament to this effect. The Slovak Government proceeds from 
the proposals made within the movement [Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS)], which state that, should the 
government reject this date, it would be necessary to rely on 
the citizens' decision in a referendum. If there is a delay in 
solving this situation, this will have a negative impact on this 
state with regard to its position abroad and its internal 
economic and social situation. What is being prepared for 
tomorrow and for the day after is extremely foolish and 
irresponsible. Therefore, the government's stance is that the 
crisis should be overcome by the citizens as soon as possible. 
  [Announcer] Mr. Prime Minister, you held talks today also in 
parliamentary, groups where all this has been discussed. Do all 
deputies agree that early elections should be held in June? 
  [Unidentified speaker] The chairman of the Slovak National 
Party's parliamentary club, Miroslav Kona, said that early 
parliamentary elections would suit them, too, but only in the 
fall. 
  [Meciar] [passage omitted] Can we afford a provisional 
government and instability for several months? Who would hold 
talks with it, and what important decisions could such a 
government make? What would be its time span? 
  The second problem: A number of economic issues are already 
being worked on, such as loans, talks on transport lines, on 
commerce and so on. [passage omitted] 
  Having a provisional government can have a serious impact on 
commercial relations. [passage omitted] Everything will come to 
a standstill. 
  Take the visit of Mr. Kozyrev, which was to be of key 
importance and which is not going to take place for these 
political reasons. This is a great loss for the Slovak Republic, 
and not only in the political sense. It will, naturally, be 
reflected elsewhere as well. Therefore a delay is not good for 
us. [passage omitted] 
  If the governmental bill is not passed in parliament--and we 
shall submit the proposal already at this parliamentary 
session--we envisage that petitions will start immediately from 
the coming Monday. Should 350,000 citizens sign a petition in 
favor of early elections or in favor of changing the ratio of 
deputies in parliament or in favor of two other questions, 
which, according to our proposal, should be answered in a 
referendum, a referendum is necessary. This means that all 
citizens will make a decision in a pan-national vote. It is a 
new institution, common in Switzerland, still not used in our 
country but it is the most democratic one. [passage omitted] 
  We have been given responsibility by the people; we must 
humbly and respectfully go to them and ask whether they continue 
to want us and trust us. If they confirm us, we shall continue 
to work. If they reject us it is their right which we have to 
respect. In any case, however, things must be left to run 
freely in this direction and till then the simplest thing is to 
leave the government to prepare the elections in a democratic 
way because any other change would mean enormous losses. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Unidentified man] I would like to ask about a debate on 
two amendments to the law on large-scale privatization. You 
have said that you would like to connect it with a vote of 
confidence in the government. Is it still true or have you 
given up this intention? My second question: There have been 
rumors that pressure actions are being prepared, and that coach 
trips to Bratislava to support you are being prepared by the 
districts. Do you know something about this? 
  [Meciar] [passage omitted] We are willing, with regard to 
this bill, to make some concessions. For example, the finance 
minister does not need to be the chairman of the supervisory 
council. We will, however, not retreat on the point of the 
government having influence on the Presidium of the [National 
Property] Fund and being interlined with its personnel because 
the proposal of the other side contains some badly thought-out 
mechanisms. [passage omitted] 
  [Unidentified man] You have not answered my question: Will 
you consider the vote of confidence in the government if the 
privatization bill is not passed? 
  [Meciar] We have discussed it in the government. Part of the 
cabinet was for connecting the two, the majority was against. 
This means that the government will not link tomorrow the 
privatization bill with the proposal of the vote of confidence 
in the government. Should the Slovak parliament pass a law which 
is not acceptable by the government, we should return it to 
parliament in a constitutional way, through the president. 
  [Announcer] What about the pressure actions? 
  [Meciar] This is a novelty to me. If somebody wants to 
change some structures, he cannot leave out the citizens because 
consequently they have behaved without restraint. We have, 
however, not organized it and I know nothing of it. 
  [Announcer] Is the government prepared, for example, for the 
presence of several hundred people in front of parliament 
tomorrow who would not behave in a very civilized fashion? 
  [Meciar] [passage omitted] Why should the government deal 
with it if the public order is not in jeopardy? [passage 
omitted] Until the citizens violate the public order the 
government will not take any measures against them. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Announcer] The president has also given a press conference 
today: he asked his constitutional experts for opinion on the 
question to be asked in a referendum with regard to 
retroactivity. If 350,000 citizens sign a petition in favor of a 
referendum he will submit the issue to the constitutional court 
before the referendum is called. 
  [Meciar] [passage omitted] If there are 350,000 signatories, 
the president is obliged to call a referendum within 30 days. 
[passage omitted] The force of a referendum surpasses that of 
the constitutional court. [passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] The constitution says that a deputy is to carry 
out his duty according to his conscience. A referendum on this 
issue would be about this basic human right. The constitution 
says that there can be no referendum on basic human rights. 
  [Meciar] [passage omitted] A deputy cannot be free to the 
extent that he can act independently of his original programm 
and of the party on behalf of which he is elected. [passage 
omitted] It is up to the citizens to decide whether they want to 
be represented in parliament by Messrs Knazko and company, by 
Messrs Cernak and company: if the citizens say that they do not 
want them they will be replaced by people who will, on their 
behalf, carry out their duties following from their original 
programs. It is not possible to have part of a movement tear 
itself away, for the intentions which might not be always be 
that of common good, and then having them start to destroy the 
party which has paid for them to be provided for for quite a 
long time by an institution such as parliament. [passage omitted] 
  [Meciar] According to the Constitution, political parties 
are independent of the state, and the state representatives have 
no right to interfere in their internal affairs. 
  If the presidential castle had not been mentioning for 
months 
that Mr. Kovac or Mr. Moravcik were to be alternative prime 
ministers, this crisis did not have to happen. [passage omitted] 
Therefore the HZDS has decided: Either it will continue to form 
a government--and we are sincerely willing to talk about 
coalition--or it will be in opposition and nobody will force 
upon it any prime minister. [passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] We are to discuss here the course of the 
government session today. In the afternoon, this session was 
closed but we presume that you decided about the further destiny 
of Roman Kovac and Moravcik. They told Slovak Television today 
that you asked them to leave while Lexa and Hanko said at noon 
that they left on their own accord. What was the decision you 
made this afternoon? 
  [Meciar] They went on their own accord. I recommended to 
them to resign, but it is not the same thing as dismissing them. 
Mr. Kovac said that they were leaving the cabinet session and 
they left; it is their business. If somebody has the courage 
for a political action, he must be able to face the 
consequences. If somebody is preparing a new government, behind 
the back of the existing government--and I have spoken to five 
people who told me that Mr. Kovac had told them to be ready to 
join the government this week and a sixth was being discussed by 
somebody else [as heard]--this is an unfair action, to say the 
least. 
  When we asked Mr. Kovac openly whether he acted in this way 
he denied it. Mr. Moravcik did the same. When we asked them 
whether they were preparing a fraction within the parliamentary 
group, they gave their word of honor that they were not. When 
we asked them whether they were conducting negotiations with 
opposition parties, they claimed not only to me but before the 
whole political board of the movement that this was a lie. 
  This is not an opinion of a minority; this is a political 
construction which has grown into a destruction of the 
parliamentary group of the HZDS, into almost conspiratorial 
talks with other political entities and into the formation of a 
new government without being asked to do so by the Movement, or 
by the president, or by the legitimate constitutional bodies. 
  If this is called a normal or alternative activity, we 
cannot 
approve of it. Therefore we have said that the right thing is 
for these gentlemen to leave of their own will. As they do not 
want to do so, the government finds it natural that in this case 
I have to submit to the president a proposal to have them 
recalled because they lost the confidence of the Movement. 
[passage omitted] 
  Now they rely on the positive attitude of the president 
towards them. Meciar will propose their dismissal, and the 
president will not accept it, they think. The government, 
however, does not want to have them in its midst. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Announcer] Does it mean, Mr. Prime Minister, that you are 
going to submit a proposal to have them dismissed? 
  [Meciar] I am going to submit the proposal for their 
dismissal tomorrow. I have informed the president about it on 
Monday [14 February]; he asked for time to think it over. The 
government was unanimous on this. The great majority of the 
HZDS presidium has decided that they cannot be trusted in this 
office. Then it is up to me to decide on what pretext to keep 
them in the government: as representatives of the opposition 
which they joined? And of what sort of opposition? On what 
basis? This is against democratic principles and this is 
another pretext for the creation of a new political problem. 
  [Announcer] The president has said today that you had 
pointed out to you today that the dismissal of the deputy prime 
minister and minister Moravcik could have a negative impact on 
the international reputation of Slovakia. 
  [Meciar] I have told the president that this argument cannot 
be accepted. What sort of foreign minister announces publicly 
that the government of which he forms a part should be 
overthrown? Is this a good signal for the world? Is it good 
when Mr. Kozyrev is to come, and the government agrees with his 
visit and decides which member of the government is to hold 
talks with him and in the meantime, somebody else is holding 
talks about cancelling this visit? This is working against the 
government and its policy. 
  There have been also many specific objections to the work of 
the foreign minister, which the government frequently 
criticised. The foreign minister knew about them and also the 
president knew about them. [passage omitted] 
  The president was looking for a pretext to justify what he 
told me on Monday, and none of us accepted it. I and my 
deputies, with the exception of Mr. Kovac, and Parliamentary 
Speaker Mr. Gasparovic held those talks with him. The president 
has the right to have his opinion and he has also the right, 
according to that unfortunate constitutional court, to say that 
he would not accept the dismissals. What will be achieved by 
this? There will a minister in the government who will 
represent nobody, who will be there against the will of all, 
apart from the will of the president. But I am the one who is 
responsible for the work of the government. Will I be assessed 
on the work of the person who was forced upon me? [passage 
omitted] 
  The world wants us to be stable, instead of having another 
source of tension. I would therefore ask the president to solve 
the situation speedily to stabilize the situation. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Announcer] The Czech side has obviously been taken by 
surprise that the Slovak customs officers have started to ask 
for special certificates on the quality of [exported] 
foodstuffs. Minister Dlouhy called it unfair; allegedly you had 
informed them only 24 hours before the introduction of these 
measures, and Prime Minister Klaus allegedly had a telephone 
conversation with you yesterday morning and you promised him 
that the government would be discussing this problem seriously 
at its session today. According to the Czech press, he asked 
us to halt these measures prior to the extraordinary session of 
the Customs Union. What measures have you adopted? 
  [Meciar] The government has discussed it. It is not such a 
big problem as it seems as these are usual [word indistinct] 
norms which must be observed, and everybody who exports food 
must submit a certificate that his goods are of the agreed 
quality. The only change is that in the past, the quality 
certificate was to be submitted to the customs office at the 
destination and now it is demanded at the border because at the 
destination this had not been done. Naturally it caused 
problems for people who had neglected this obligation. Few 
lorries--not too many--were stuck on the Czech side and this 
created anxiety. 
  Therefore the government reassessed the situation and asked 
Mr. Ducky, as chairman of the Customs Union Council, to convene 
an extraordinary session of the Council tomorrow where 
everything is to be discussed--not only the quality of goods but 
also the balance of payment. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Rome, Feb 16 (AFP) -- A U.S. military fighter plane 
from NATO's base in Aviano, northern Italy, crashed in Slovenia 
Wednesday though the pilot managed to eject from the craft and 
escaped unhurt, informed sources here said. 
  The F-16 crashed while the pilot was attempting to make an 
emergency landing in the former Yugoslav republic bordering 
Italy though it was not immediately known why. 
  Planes at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization base in 
Aviano have been patrolling Bosnian skies for months and are 
among those that would be used should NATO go ahead with its 
threat to launch air strikes on Bosnian Serb forces besieging 
Sarajevo.

  [Text] Aviano, Italy, Feb 16 (AFP) -- A U.S. military 
fighter plane from the NATO base here crashed in the former 
Yugoslav republic of Slovenia Wednesday attempting an emergency 
landing but the pilot ejected and is safe, a U.S. spokesman at 
the base said. 
  He said the pilot had been hospitalized, but did not say 
where nor give his condition. 
  The F-16 fighter plane was on a routine training flight when 
it went down near the small town of Portoroz near the Adriatic 
coast as the pilot tried to make an emergency landing for 
reasons that were not immedialy known. 
  In Ljubljana, the Slovenian news agency STA said the 
fighter's pilot had contacted Portoroz' small civilian airport 
shortly before the crash asking permission to land because of a 
technical failure on board his aircraft. 
  When given the go-ahead, he tried to bring his plane down on 
the tiny landing strip but was unable to keep it on the runway. 
  STA said the plane crashed into the Adriatic after the pilot 
ejected. 
  It also said the fighter had weapons on board but the pilot 
ejected them into the sea before attempting to land. 
  The U.S. spokesman here said the plane had been training for 
NATO's operation Deny Flight, which enforces the no-fly zone 
over Bosnia. 
  Planes at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization base in 
Aviano have been patrolling Bosnian skies for months and are 
among those that would be used should NATO go ahead with its 
threat to launch air strikes on Bosnian Serb forces besieging 
Sarajevo.

  [Text] Zagreb, Feb 16 (AFP) -- UN officials were meeting 
in the Slovenian border town of Mokrice Wednesday to discuss the 
safety of humanitarian aid workers in Bosnia in view of the 
threat of a NATO air strike against Bosnia's defiant Serbs. 
  "The main issue of the meeting is going to be the safety of 
humanitarian aid workers in Bosnia under present conditions," 
said special UN representative Yasushi Akashi. 
  Akashi was meeting with UN High Commissioner for Refugees 
Sadako Ogata and UN peace mediator Thorvald Stoltenberg. 
Mokrice is about 30 kilometres (18 miles) west of Zagreb. 
  NATO last week issued an ultimatum to Bosnia's warring 
parties, particularly the Serbs, to move their weapons from 
around Sarajevo by midnight Sunday or face air strikes.

  [Excerpt] Knin, 12 Feb (TANJUG)--The constituent session of 
the assembly of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] has started 
in Knin. The session is chaired by Branko Peric of Knin, the 
oldest deputy. However, the session was interrupted and a 
recess announced due to serious disagreements over the adoption 
of the agenda and the verification of the deputies' mandates. 
  The assembly became divided into two camps: deputies from 
the Serb Democratic Party of Krajina [SDS] and from the Serbian 
Radical Party in one, and deputies from all the other parties 
and citizens' groups in the other. 
  This development dashed hopes that the first session of the 
new Krajina parliament would be held in a jubilant atmosphere 
and that the deputies would transcend party interests--something 
the Chairman Peric had called for at the beginning of the 
session. Drago Kovacevic, head of the SDS group of deputies, 
proposed that the assembly president and deputy presidents be 
elected first and that Milan Martic be sworn in as president 
afterward, while the agenda proposed the opposite. [passage

  [Text] On 15 February in Skopje Macedonian President Kiro 
Gligorov received Angel Dimitrov, the newly appointed Bulgarian 
ambassador to Macedonia, who presented his credentials. The 
meeting was attended by Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski, our 
reporter Kostadin Filipov reports. 
  [Begin Filipov recording] In his speech Ambassador Angel 
Dimitrov stressed that Bulgaria had been the first state to 
recognize the Republic of Macedonia, and the first direct 
neighbor of Macedonia that had established full diplomatic 
relations with that state. 
  This is an expression of the Republic of Bulgaria's 
prudence, 
farsightedness, and determination to develop relations with the 
Republic of Macedonia on the basis of mutual respect and sincere 
friendship -- the only possibility of asserting peace and 
stability on the Balkan peninsula, Ambassador Dimitrov pointed 
out. 
  Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov stressed the unique 
personal contribution of Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev, with 
whom he said he has relations of sincere friendship and 
understanding. He also pointed out Macedonia's great interest 
in maintaining stable and goodneighborly relations with 
Bulgaria. Mr. Gligorov also expressed Macedonia's interest in 
developing and strengthening cooperation in all areas of mutual 
interest and benefit. 
  Now a broad field opens for cultural, economic, scientific, 
and other cooperation, connecting the two countries with the 
necessary railroad, modern highways, and telecommunications, 
Kiro Gligorov stressed. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Panta Dzambazovski: "Who in the PDP Is the PDP?"] </F>
  [Text] The inevitable has happened -- the largest party of 
the Albanians in Macedonia, the PDP [Party for Democratic 
Prosperity], has split. The attempt to reach a compromise 
between the two opposing sides at an early congress produced no 
results -- it was precisely at this congress that the final 
split occurred. 
  The deputies and ministers group, as well as the majority of 
congress delegates, left the hall when they saw that the other 
side, the supporters of the radical Menduh Taci [chairman of the 
Tetovo branch of the PDP], was making every effort to hold the 
congress outside the Statute. What is more, Taci's group, which 
made the technical preparations for the congress -- it never 
crossed their minds to raise the Macedonian flag beside the 
party flag and the Albanian flag -- used force: They barred 
entry to members of the Central Assembly and prevented them from 
participating in the congress (a congress body), they prevented 
former president Nevzat Halili attending, and they deprived the 
delegates and ministers of their right to vote! A working 
presidency was not elected, for which only Menduh Taci's 
supporters were proposed! Some delegates of several 
simultaneously "formed" branches were also introduced. The 
intention was clear -- to ensure that Taci's current won at all 
costs. 
  His supporters had another objective -- to take over the 
name 
and property of the party. The party seal was "sequestered," 
and the rooms of the Tetovo Center occupied. Obviously, it will 
be up to the court to decide -- who in the PDP is the PDP. 
<H5>  Political Differences </H5>
  Something that has been clear for some time was once again 
confirmed: Taci's group is supported by the Republic of Albania. 
The delegation attending from Tirana, besides delivering the 
welcome speech (after the ministers and deputies group had 
left), remained till the end with Taci's supporters. The Kosovo 
delegation, sitting in the fourth row and not together with the 
guests from Albania, who were sitting in the first row, remained 
neutral after the "split" and left for Pristina, although they 
are on the side of the deputies group. 
  Here is further evidence that Tirana is deeply involved in 
the party division and that it supports the "Tacists": Albanian 
Television's report on the congress was confined to Taci's 
congress, with the solitary remark that "a group of delegates 
left the congress," without mentioning the fact that it also 
held a congress. Let us recall that Albania has hosted Menduh 
Taci a couple of times, giving him support at very high level: 
the leadership of the ruling Democratic Party of Albania, 
various ministers, and even the Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi. 
  Only at first sight does it seem that there are no 
differences in the programs of the two sides. As far as 
political activities are concerned, however, the differences are 
enormous and very substantial. At its congress Taci's group 
assessed that the deputies and ministers had a different 
ideology -- progovernment. They assessed that the final goal 
must be the unification of all Albanians! According to Taci, 
under the old leadership "Ilirida" remained undefined, and the 
result of the (government) coalition was the arms affair and the 
creation of other Albanian parties, which "destroyed the 
Albanian people." Another conclusion was that -- the Yugoslav 
Army and the Macedonian authorities were arming the Macedonians 
in their homes, and therefore the "Albanians had to create 
paramilitary formations!" 
  In his report Taci accused the PDP and the deputies group of 
failing "to accentuate the interests of the Albanians" and said 
that the Albanians were not "an equal and authentic subject in 
Macedonia." As if the process of political activities aiming at 
national equality were limited in time, after which other 
methods of activities had to be undertaken. It is weird that a 
negative reply was given to the "authenticity" of the Albanian 
subject in Macedonia. Taci remarked that the position of the 
deputies group in parliament was dependent (is it not logical 
and normal with 22 deputies positions?) and that the coalition 
was created without having a political platform (and what is the 
PDP program, which is normally represented by the deputies 
group, with its additional requests, depending on the activities 
and agenda of parliament, which are not constant?). 
<H5>  No More Coming Together </H5>
  Quite a different tune from that of Taci's supporters 
prevailed at the congress held by the supporters of the group of 
deputies and ministers, where all conditions were fulfilled to 
make it the Second PDP Congress. Aside from raising a large 
Macedonian flag, it was reiterated that the PDP will operate 
only through the institutions of the state, and that it was in 
the interest of the Albanian factor to have the party operate 
within the state authority. How the Albanians could otherwise 
pledge to promote their status in the state is dangerous even to 
think of. It was also said that the PDP must pledge to maintain 
peace and stability in the state, which was their fatherland, 
and official Albania was accused of interfering in the affairs 
of an "authentic party." 
  The question now is -- what will become of the PDP? 
According to the first statements in the course of the two 
congresses, both sides claimed to have the right to the party. 
Taci was precise: "One of the dilemmas is over -- we inherit 
the party." This is probably not the case, however, because 
their congress was of doubtful legitimacy. The deputies and 
ministers group did not even think of whose hands continuity was 
in: "They had created a scenario and a voting team" (Naser 
Ziberi, their elected secretary, said). 
  Yesterday, when we believed passions had cooled, we put the 
same question to both sides. The leader of the so-called "hard 
current," radical Menduh Taci, elected vice president by his 
supporters, declined to make a statement. He simply directed us 
to someone else: "Ask President Arben Djaferi." Djaferi said 
he would be giving neither statements nor interviews this week, 
but he agreed to give us an interview after the end of the week. 
Let us recall, Taci had also promised to give us an interview, 
but he did not keep his promise. 
  We asked Djeladin Murati, the newly elected president of 
the other side, to make a statement. He is also vice chairman 
of the Macedonian People's Assembly. First, he told us he would 
occupy this position only temporarily. He was candidate for 
president of both sides, but he said he could not remain with 
the "Tacists" because they worked contrary to the Statute. 
"Privately, I never believed this would happen, and the PDP 
must survive even if there is a small degree unity and even if 
there are the problems of a careerist nature. The struggle for 
power must be waged in a democratic way, and not by way of 
disqualifying and labeling people," Murati told us. 
  Further, Murati pointed out that divisions occur in other 
parties, too, and that the process of political differentiation 
and definition was normal, and usually beneficial. Murati said 
that the dispute within the PDP was of a program nature. He 
also emphasized, however, that arguments were needed, not simply 
some desires for autonomy, "Iliridas," or the refusal to join 
the Macedonian Army.... "The PDP pledges the maintenance of 
peace and stability, prosperity for the Albanians, without 
neglecting the others in Macedonia. I believe there will be a 
process of reexamination in the demonstrated relations, but it 
is unlikely the two sides will come together." If the other 
side wanted the name PDP, in Murati's opinion, it would have to 
give it a suffix.

  [Text] [Announcer] The work so far on Poland's 
participation in the Partnership for Peace program has been 
presented at a joint meeting of the Sejm commissions for foreign 
affairs and for national defense by Foreign Minister Andrzej 
Olechowski and Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejdzyk. Our 
foreign minister told the deputies that a program was already 
being worked on by a joint working party of the Defense and 
Foreign Affairs Ministries. National Defense Minister 
Kolodziejdzyk emphasized that sending a Polish mission to NATO 
Headquarters was a matter of urgency. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Koziol] Does the Defense 
Ministry have the money to send a mission to NATO headquarters? 
  [Kolodziejdzyk] Right now we do not. Right now we do not 
have 
money for anything because the budget has not been adopted. Of 
course, we are going to look for it because we cannot completely 
put this initiative aside. Well, we are going to look for 
reserves, perhaps cut something back from training, perhaps call 
up fewer soldiers for military service. There are no good 
solutions here, but we have to have a sense of vision as to what 
is right now the most important thing for Poland's security and 
what can be left to one side for another five minutes. We have 
to talk about actually entering NATO structures, about actual 
presence, participation in exercises, in missions, in symposia, 
in meetings. Unfortunately this cannot be done without money. 
That today is our great problem. 
  [Koziol] The Polish Government has to prepare a document.... 
  [Kolodziejdzyk, interrupting] A presentation document, that 
is what it is called. 
  [Koziol] So, could you tell me, today we heard that there 
are 
no dates set for this. So how do you, Minister, see this in real 
terms? When should this (?happen)? 
  [Kolodziejdzyk] Well, I see this in very real terms. I would 
not like this government in which I participate to make any 
spectacular, hurried, badly prepared moves. We said today that 
the government still has to work on this document, consult with 
the Sejm National Defense Commission about it, discuss it among 
ourselves, calmly, and with full awareness of how much this is 
going to cost, whether can we afford it, and so on. So, rushing 
things here would not be a good idea. I think that in March we 
will be ready for talks with NATO HQ, for the so-called 
bilateral negotiations from which it will transpire how we are 
going to move along the road, not so much toward partnership but 
toward security structures. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Journalists asked both ministers to comment on 
yesterday's WASHINGTON POST report that, in the 1980's, Poland 
allegedly sold weapons to the United States for $2 million. 
According to Minister Kolodziejdzyk, these reports are fiction. 
  [Begin Kolodziejdzyk recording] THE WASHINGTON POST, using 
its outstanding journalism, has written an article that smacks 
of a horror story. Why doesn't our press summon up enough 
courage to ponder and analyze what the purpose could be of 
publishing such phenomenal, even fantasy, stories? So far, the 
Pentagon has refused to comment on these facts. I see no reason 
to rush ahead of the Pentagon right now because, after all, it 
is their work, and they are also a suspect, seeing as allegedly, 
all in all, it was two parties who were involved in this 
underhand dealing. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Minister Olechowski would not give an 
unambiguous 
reply. 
  [Begin Olechowski recording] It says--if it is true, of 
course, because I have no reason to maintain that it either is 
or is not--that, over several years, several million dollars' 
worth of equipment was sold, and no one knows what the bottom 
line was, how much of this went toward some sort of bribes or 
middlemen, well, I do not know, they must have been selling 
braces because it seems that it was very cheap equipment, so, 
perhaps in general it was a very good move because perhaps 
Polish weapon components were being sold. [sentence as heard] 
I do not know. For me this is such a mystery that, until I have 
read about it and learned something, I am not going to know.

  [Text] Zbigniew Ostrowski, press spokesman for the Ministry 
of Foreign Economic Cooperation, asked to comment on THE 
WASHINGTON POST article that reported on Poland's sales of 
modern Soviet military equipment to the United States, said that 
the matter should be treated as press revelations. Apart from 
this, in his opinion it is a matter for historians. Even if 
such sales did take place, they would have been secret and could 
now probably only be traced in the Ministry of National Defense. 
  Zbigniew Ostrowski pointed out that the most modern Soviet 
weapons have never been available to Poland, so they could not 
have been sold to the Americans. He also emphasized that the 
United States does not make available the most modern weapons to 
its allies, either.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksander Frydrychowicz: "Polish Generals </F>
Issue a Denial"] 
  [Text] A scandal has arisen following the publication by 
THE WASHINGTON POST of an article alleging that, in the 1980's, 
Poland sold Soviet supersecret missile systems to the United 
States, whence they reached the hands of Afghan partisans and 
were later used to knock down USSR aircraft. The author of the 
article is Benjamin Weiser, who has written controversial 
material based on interviews with Ryszard Kuklinski [Polish Army 
colonel who defected to the United States]. We decided to 
obtain information straight from the sources. This is what 
generals, without whose knowledge such a deal would not have 
been possible, told us. 
  General Florian Siwicki, former minister of national 
defense: 
"The Ministry of National Defense did not indulge in weapons 
deals. This kind of activity was the domain of the Central 
Engineering Administration, which was governed by the Ministry 
of Industry. The Ministry of National Defense okayed any 
contracts prepared by the Central Engineering Administration. I 
do not remember our selling weapons to the Americans. I 
probably would not forget such a thing. 
  "I rule out the existence of any deals involving the sale of 
arms to the United States. Such deals could not possibly have 
been legally implemented without my knowledge. I know of no 
cases involving weapons sales to the United States at all. We 
sold weapons to Syria, Libya, Iraq, Hungary, Bulgaria, and 
India. At that time, it was implausible to supply NATO member 
countries. Perhaps there was some kind of smuggling going on. 
But without concrete details, we cannot express any stance. It 
is mainly our own Polish-produced weapons that we sold." 
  General Zbigniew Nowicki, former Polish Army chief technical 
inspector: "When I heard this news, I wondered why we should 
have sold these missile systems to the Americans if the 
Americans themselves obtained them straight from Israel 
following the helicopter sortie into Iraq. 
  "Yes, we did sell Soviet weapons, but these were old tanks, 
helicopters, and airplanes, and only single units. This took 
place via the Central Engineering Administration. 
  "It was impossible to sell modern weaponry from one camp to 
another. We in the Ministry of National Defense might not have 
known about every single deal. We would certainly have known 
about the big ones, but I cannot rule out the possibility of 
some petty smuggling. But it cannot have involved tanks, 
missiles, or radar equipment. 
  "Perhaps one or two pieces of equipment might have been sold 
on a trial basis without my knowledge to countries to which we 
later sent larger quantities of weapons following a government 
decision. After all, just like today, there were lists of 
countries to which exports of our defense systems were 
prohibited. As our main enemy, the United States was on this 
embargo. 
  "Such a deal could not have escaped the attention of Soviet 
intelligence, and no government would have risked cutting itself 
off from new licenses and new USSR weapon systems." 
  General Czeslaw Kiszczak, former minister of internal 
affairs: "This is the first time I have heard of sales of Soviet 
weapons to the United States, and I exclude the possibility of 
such a deal having ever taken place. Of course, anything is 
possible in this world, but I do not think I could have been 
ignorant of such an issue. I was too close to General 
Jaruzelski, General Siwicki, and many generals on the General 
Staff. It would have been simply impossible for me not to know 
about it. 
  "Another story is possible, however. We sold many weapons 
and systems to various countries, and one cannot rule out the 
possibility that the Americans grabbed part of a consignment 
somewhere along the way. But I rule out the allegation that we 
sold the Americans several hundred or several thousand 
antiaircraft missiles that ended up in Afghanistan."

<F P=106> [Interview with Jan Maria Rokita, Sejm deputy for the </F>
Democratic Union and former chief of the Office of the Council 
of Ministers, by Ryszard Rybus; place and date not given: 
"Pawlak's Pyrrhic Victory; Conversation with Jan Maria Rokita"] 
  [Text] [Rybus] Does the recent coalition crisis and the 
way it was resolved represent a stabilization of the governing 
arrangement, or the beginning of its collapse? 
  [Rokita] It means neither. It is obvious that the governing 
coalition's deep crisis, which is linked--this is my 
impression--not to differences of opinions on substantive 
issues, but rather to a struggle for power inside the cabinet, 
neither strengthens nor stabilizes the government. On the 
contrary, the crisis destabilizes and weakens the government, it 
ruins its social reputation. 
  But on the other hand, I am not very eager to draw hasty 
conclusions from the crisis or to say that the coalition is on 
the verge of collapsing. The will of being in power is a strong 
cementing factor for the coalition. For the Democratic Left 
Alliance [SLD], and in particular for the old Polish United 
Workers Party [PZPR] apparatus, being in power has an enormous 
psychological significance because it means a kind of 
compensation for the last four years. For the Polish Peasant 
Party [PSL] in turn, being in power is a fulfillment of Waldemar 
Pawlak's "immemorial" aspirations to be the head of government; 
he will not give that up easily. 
  [Rybus] So you do not agree with the view that the unanimous 
showing of who in the coalition is in charge, indirectly means 
the coalition's stabilization since there are no longer two 
equal partners who could argue over leadership? 
  [Rokita] The effects of the crisis undoubtedly mean a defeat 
for Aleksander Kwasniewski. But they also represent Waldemar 
Pawlak's Pyrrhic victory. 
  [Rybus] [No question published] 
  [Rokita] The price paid for the victory in the battle for 
spheres of influence, was a decrease in public esteem, which has 
very negative consequences for the prime minister. 
  Apart from that, my view is that one cannot really speak of 
Prime Minister Pawlak's domination in the coalition since Marek 
Borowski's departure as a result of the dispute (and 
Kwasniewski's disavowal of him, including a brutal description) 
also represents a success by the PZPR apparatus which had 
clearly disliked Borowski. To a certain extent, the result of 
the dispute we are talking about here also strengthens 
Kwasniewski, but not as a leader of reformers within SLD, but as 
a real leader of the apparatus, as a leader who wants to 
implement the interests of the apparatus and for that goal, he 
is willing to betray and abandon his political friends. 
  [Rybus] Regardless of different views on the manner in which 
the prime minister resolved the conflict, it would be hard to 
deny political efficiency to him and PSL. A party which gained 
as many votes as the Democratic Union [UD] and the 
Liberal-Democratic Congress [KLD]--but far fewer votes than the 
SLD--is gradually acquiring an indivisible power. 
  [Rokita] I do not share that view. The crisis centered 
around [former Deputy Finance Minister] Kawalec and [former 
Finance Minister] Borowski, only shows a lack of the efficiency 
of influence by so-called SLD reformers, which by the way was 
easily predictable. But it does not mean a decline in influence 
by the hard-line, postcommunist apparatus. Forcing the chief of 
the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic and of SLD to get 
rid of Borowski, over whose candidacy for the post of finance 
minister he [Kwasniewski] had fought vigorously, is, like I 
already said, Pawlak's Pyrrhic victory. It is also a real 
victory by the PZPR-derived apparatus. 
  In my view, the conclusion regarding PSL's domination as a 
result of the dispute we are talking about here, is completely 
false. 
  [Rybus] So if the postcommunist apparatus is now gaining 
victory within SLD, that means you uphold your argument you had 
declared immediately after the elections, about UD's refusal to 
take part in any coalition arrangements with SLD? 
  [Rokita] I have always said--and I do so now--that the 
political logic set in motion during the election campaign will 
force Kwasniewski to either lose ground in the party which will 
finally "spit him out," or to take the leadership of a communist 
apparatus. 
  To put it briefly: I have never believed--and I continue not 
to believe--in the governing parties' ability to reform 
themselves. That is why I have been and still am in favor of a 
tough opposition by UD. 
  [Rybus] That explains your assessment of a famous statement 
by [UD Deputy Chairman] Wladyslaw Frasyniuk .... 
  [Rokita] I think Frasyniuk's statement was a political 
mistake. And that is not just how I feel, but it is also the 
assessment of practically all of UD, including party Chairman 
Mazowiecki, and chairman of the parliamentary club Geremek. The 
mistake was made clear to Frasyniuk in harsh terms during party 
meetings. 
  But is it also true that his intentions were distorted by 
sensation-seeking media. Pay attention that Frasyniuk had not 
made an appeal for UD to come to alliance with SLD, not today, 
and not at any time in the future. On the contrary, he is the 
kind of member of UD who is in favor of a strong opposition 
stand toward SLD. But what he also thinks--and that is an 
interesting view, even though I do not agree with it--is that 
under a situation where Aleksander Kwasniewski and the PZPR 
apparatus abandon leaders of the reform wing, there should be 
someone to publicly speak of these people in kind terms. There 
is no doubt that Borowski had played a positive role in Pawlak's 
cabinet. 
  [Rybus] So, regarding UD's opposition nature, do you regard 
it as necessary to maintain it until the end of this 
parliament's term? 
  [Rokita] Yes, I do. To construct a government with UD's 
participation, or with the participation of the club of a new 
party which will be formed after unification with KLD--that is 
not possible under the parliament which was elected on 19 
September. What is possible, is a collapse of the governing 
coalition and one could imagine some strange forms of a 
government which would be openly antireform (even though I 
regard them as not very likely), but I cannot imagine a 
situation where UD, with this parliamentary composition, could 
find partners for itself with whom to establish a majority 
coalition. There are no such partners, nor will there ever be, 
until the end of term of this parliament, which does not 
necessarily mean that I think the term will last four years. 
After the recent events, a four-year term seems less and less 
likely, especially given that in the middle of the term we will 
have presidential elections which always change the political 
scene everywhere.

<F P=106> [Interview with Solidarity Chairman Marian Krzaklewski by </F>
Jerzy Pawlas; place and date not given: "We Do Not Want To 
Strike"] 
  [Excerpts] [Pawlas] We are supposed to have left the 
recession behind, and yet this year's budget makes it look as if 
we are still in the depths of the recession. 
  [Krzaklewski] Recession means a fall in the GNP. But the 
GNP has been rising in recent years. In 1992 it rose by 1.9 
percent, and in 1993 it rose by 4 percent. Industrial output 
has risen even more. In a situation like this, every trade 
union has the right and duty to demand wage rises in the 
production sphere. Wages should rise faster than prices. We 
included this postulate in the "accords to compensate the 
increase in the cost of living," in other words the Enterprise 
Pact. The provisions are clear. An increase in real wages in 
the production sphere cannot be less than half the increase in 
the GNP. The pact has been signed into law, but not only is the 
present government failing to implement this law, it is ignoring 
it altogether. In view of this, every self-respecting trade 
union must dictate harsh terms to the government, including the 
possibility of a general strike. Therefore we demand an 
increase in real wages, at least to offset the increased living 
costs, because the country is experiencing an economic growth. 
A preliminary analysis of the 1994 draft budget shows that 
there is a danger that the real incomes of families will fall 
even further. We cannot agree to that, all the more so because 
1993 was another year of economic growth. And that is the main 
reason for our demonstration on 9 February. 
  [Pawlas] Governments are not accustomed to adhere to pacts. 
That is a tradition dating to communist times. However, they do 
tend to lay down so-called social guarantees, a process that can 
last for months. So what is the point of establishing pacts 
when the budget is empty? 
  [Krzaklewski] I fear that unless the philosophy behind 
fiscal policy changes soon, there will be continued talk of 
empty budgets over the next few years, despite the increase in 
output. Also, an increasingly greater proportion of the GNP is 
going to be swallowed by the so-called gray economic zone and by 
investors. The rich will get richer, and the poor poorer. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Pawlas] The defense industry has staged a strike, and the 
miners are demanding higher wages. Can the 9 February 
demonstration be regarded as a forerunner to a general strike? 
  [Krzaklewski] Yes, if the government fails to adjust the 
socioeconomic program laid down in the 1994 draft budget, and if 
it fails to implement the whole of the 1992-93 social pact, 
known as the Enterprise Pact, within a reasonable time, such as 
by the end of March 1994. I hope we do not reach a situation in 
which we have to declare a strike. 
  Our postulates concerning the budget and Enterprise Pact are 
possible for the government and parliament to fulfill, and their 
fulfillment will stabilize the social situation. We also insist 
that the government fulfill not more than 10 percent of the 
preelection promises of the coalition parties.

<F P=106> [Article by J.B.L.: "Solidarity Should Join In; </F>
Negotiations With Trade Unions on Social Guarantees"] 
  [Text] The government positively assesses the 
readiness by the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union 
"Solidarity" to conduct talks, declared in a letter from the 
trade union's chairman, Marian Krzaklewski, to Prime Minister 
Waldemar Pawlak, Deputy Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz 
said during Saturday's [12 February] session by the presidia of 
the Council of Ministers Economic Committee [KERM] and of the 
Council of Ministers Sociopolitical Committee [KSPRM]. 
  According to Cimoszewicz, it would be best if Solidarity 
joined the negotiations which are already taking place with the 
other trade union centers. The negotiations will continue 
regardless of whether Solidarity decides to participate in them 
since there are many partners for the talks, and they are 
sufficiently responsible partners, too. Yet, the presence of 
Solidarity "would be a very good thing to happen," Cimoszewicz 
stressed. 
  Labor Minister Leszek Miller said the government is 
interested in meeting Solidarity postulates, but it is the 
parliament and not the government that decides on the rate of 
legislative proceedings; therefore the postulate to have a batch 
of laws on enterprises enacted by 15 March should not be 
addressed to the government (which is interested in speeding up 
the proceedings within the framework of ordinary legislative 
measures). 
  According to chiefs of six working groups in which the 
negotiations with the trade unions are going on currently 
regarding citizens' social guarantees, it is possible to reach 
concrete agreements within the next few weeks, among others 
regarding family benefits and housing supplements. For 
instance, the idea of withholding family benefits from people 
with high incomes is being debated, as well as the idea of 
linking the amount of the benefit with the number of children 
and income levels. 
  The presidia of KERM and of KSPRM said the negotiations are 
difficult, but they relate to issues which are strictly of 
merit, among them the fundamentals of social policies and also 
social protections. According to Deputy Prime Minister 
Cimoszewicz, the government had submitted specific proposals and 
it is waiting now for reasonable responses; the government is 
also determined to undertake measures that will facilitate a 
speedy coming to agreement. 
  The participants of the negotiations are to receive a draft 
of the socioeconomic program for the years 1994-97, which was 
prepared by the Central Planning Administration.

<F P=106> [Article by Barbara Cieszewska: "Strike Readiness in </F>
Silesia; Tense Atmosphere Not Since Today"] 
  [Text] In eight mines of the Ruda Coal Partnership a 
referendum on joining the strike was conducted on Tuesday [15 
February]. The miners drop the "for" or "against" ballot sheets 
into the ballot boxes when they are collecting their wages. 
Preliminary data indicate that most of them support the strike. 
In other concerns (such as in Bytom, Gliwice, and Rybnik) 
negotiations are being held on wage issues and the heads of 
plant "Solidarity" ["S"] sections condition the organization of 
a similar referendum on their results. The strike readiness has 
so far been limited to placing banners around the plants. In 
this voivodship "S" has as many as 250,000 members; it also has 
1,260 plant committees. The activists of other trade unions, 
such as "Solidarity '80" (approximately 35,000 members) and 
"Kontra" (30,000 members) have already announced strike 
readiness. 
  Activists of the regional "S" are holding talks in the 
plants; they explain the core of the protest. It boils down to 
the following demands: Increasing the value of the real wages, 
introducing an efficient program of combating unemployment, and 
curbing the degradation of the Silesia-Dabrowa region. The 
Silesian "S" has put forward some more detailed demands: Fair 
distribution of the GDP, the statement that all Saturdays are 
constitutionally free, and a 40-hour workweek. Demand No. 9 
mentions changes in the tax laws that would eliminate the 
excessive tax burdens that have been imposed on employees. In 
demand No. 10 the miners want the Treasury to "compensate the 
losses incurred by enterprises as a result of the blockade of 
payments for exported commodities and services"; in the 11th 
demand they suggest that legal acts be prepared which would make 
it possible for trade unions to take a stand on employees' 
affairs in commercial law partnerships. In the last one the 
miners demand that the demands of the branches, which have been 
submitted and agreed on, be implemented. The Silesian "S" is 
also asking the parliament to adopt this year's budget in a 
shape that would take into account the implementation of the 
demands put forward by the Independent Self-Governing Trade 
Union "S," especially the demands that aim to protect the 
poorest. 
  Continuing is the protest in the Mining and Steel Work Plant 
in Bukowno; 78 miners are underground in the "Pomorzany" mine; 
on Tuesday [15 February] 46 miners went on a hunger strike. The 
protest began two weeks ago. In the meantime, union activists 
are holding talks on wages with the directors. In the Katowice 
Steel Works, which is surrounded by banners, the people are not 
thinking about a referendum yet; they are waiting for the next 
moves of the region. "The atmosphere is tense, they say in the 
Plant Committee of the steel works; however, it is not a matter 
of today only--the wages are low and this is the problem." The 
mines of the Bytom Coal Partnership are currently negotiating 
new wages with the directors, so they do not expect that a 
referendum will be held for the time being. Unless the 
negotiations fail to yield any results. The same is happening 
in the mines of the Gliwice and Rybnik partnerships; here the 
referendum may be carried out early next week. In the Jasrzebie 
partnership, where the strike has just been finished, "S" says: 
"We are working; one needs a rest after a strike; then we will 
think what should be done next."

<H5>  The President Signed the Law </H5>
  Today, the President of the Republic of Poland Lech Walesa 
signed the Law on Copyright and Related Rights of 4 
February 1994. 
  The law, which has been enacted by the Sejm, is the result 
of 
legislative measures undertaken four years ago. The law's first 
draft was submitted by the government before the First Term Sejm 
on 11 March 1992, but work on the law was not finalized due to 
the Sejm's having been dissolved. A new draft of the law was 
submitted by the government in front of the Second Term Sejm on 
6 November 1993, with a motion to have the law enacted urgently. 
Representatives of scientific, creative associations, and 
authorship organizations, as well as producer organizations, 
took part in the Sejm's work on the draft. Opinions and 
comments by these groups regarding specific provisions of the 
law, were debated upon and, in a majority of cases, taken into 
account. The final text of the law enacted on 4 February 1994 
is the result of a compromise that takes into account the 
interests of all those concerned with the copyright law, of 
authors, performers, video and audio [fonogram] producers, 
computer software producers, and radio and television 
organizations. 
  The law will replace the Copyright Law of 1952, which was in 
effect up to now and whose provisions are inadequate to suit the 
country's new economic conditions, or to the new world system 
for protection of intellectual property. 
  The legal provisions of 1952, given the enormous development 
of new areas--for instance, video, audio, and computer software 
production--are obsolete under today's conditions and are not 
suited to the existing international standards. 
  The necessity of enacting the new law was also a result of 
Poland's international obligations in the area--in particular, 
the treaty on trade and economic relations between Poland and 
the United States of 21 March 1990. Under the treaty, Poland 
obliged itself to adapt its copyright law to existing 
international conventions by 1 January 1991. 
  Apart from that, the phenomenon of piracy of intellectual 
property, which has been increasing radically in Poland and 
which was pointed out by authors and international opinion 
demanding that firm, legislative measures be undertaken to 
counteract the piracy, was another incentive for initiating 
urgent legislative proceedings concerning the new law.

  [Text] Warsaw, 10 Feb--The government has adopted author's 
amendments to the draft budget law for the year 1994 and has 
addressed the proposals of Sejm commissions put forward in the 
course of work on the budget law. The Council of Ministers has 
adopted a new verson of the document on Directions for 
Privatization in 1994, and that is an appendix to the budget law 
for the current year. A decree on the issue of tarriffs on 
components for the industrial assembly of road tractors was also 
adopted, the Government Press Office reported on 10 February. 
  At the resolution of the minister of finance, the author's 
amendments introduced on 10 February will be published only 
after their presentation at the meeting tomorrow of the Sejm 
Economic Policy, Budget and Finance Commission. 
  The Council of Ministers adopted decisions upon the increase 
of expenditures upon science, culture and education. (The 
Government Press Office will organiz a briefing tomorrow with 
the participation of the heads of the Ministry of Finance and at 
which details on the subject of the adopted autoamendments will 
be presented) 
  The members of the government adoped a new version of the 
document on the Directions of Privatization in 1994, which is an 
appendix to the budget law for this year. 
  The government adopted priorities for ownership 
transformations and also privatization programs. The 
implementation of planned ownership transformations will be 
associated with: 
  --Programs of restructuring, of the increase of domestic and 
foreign investment, for the development of competition and 
strengthening of the capital market; 
  --The application in public offers of methods favoring the 
convergence of the sale price of shares to the market prices of 
the shares of privatized enterprises; 
  --The facilitation of privatization with the active 
participation of employees, with particular attention paid to 
small and medium enterprises; 
  --The commencement of activities to radically strengthen 
ownership supervision. 
  The tasks of the government will relate to: 
  --The preparation and presentation to the Sejm, by the end 
of 
June this year, of a "privatization map", that is of the 
branches and varieties of enterprise over which the State 
Treasury intends to maintain control; 
  --The implementation of a program of financial restructuring 
of enterprises and banks; 
  --The preparation and implementation of a program of 
restructuring of sectors of special significance for the 
national economy (electric power generation, mining, metallurgy, 
the armaments and oil industries, the railways); 
  --The development of a program of transformations in the 
state agricultural and agriculture and food sectors; 
  --Assistance for the processes of restructuring of 
enterprises, especially in regions threatened by strutural 
unemployment; 
  --The preparation of a system of financial support for the 
restructuring of industry, inter alia with the privatization of 
state enterprises; 
  --The implementation of the "Pact on the State Enterprise 
during the Period of Transformation"; 
  --The implementation of the program of National Investment 
Funds; 
  --The implementation of a program of privatization of the 
banks through public offers; 
  --The creation of a system of incentives for domestic and 
foreign investors; 
  --The creation of a system of sale by instalment for 
domestic 
investors and also assistance for capital and direct 
privatization through a specially created Credit Guarantees Fund; 
  --Support for privatization by founding bodies; 
  --The increase of the number of enterprises quoted on the 
stock exchange, privatized on the basis of public offers; 
  --The counteraction of the takeover of capital control on 
given markets by single investors; 
  --The implementation of a review of the legal regulations 
for 
privatization procedures, with the aim of assuring the clarity 
and openness of procedures; 
  --The implementation of a review of the market conditions of 
the functioning of economic entities (inter alia the rules for 
protection of creditors, collection of debts, liquidations and 
bankruptcies, registration of new entities, principles for 
concessions and quotas); 
  --The undertaking of work on the preparation of an 
Industrial 
Law, and also the introduction of legal regulations, 
counteracting the widening of the so-called grey economic sphere; 
  --The undertaking of work on the regulation of the 
principles 
for privatization. 
  The government will present to parliament drafts for: 
  --A new law on the privatization of state enterprises; 
  --Laws specifying the principles for the management of the 
assets of the State Treasury. 
  The members of the Council of Ministers addressed the 
proposals for amendments put forward by Sejm commissions in the 
course of work on the budget law for 1994. 
  The Council of Ministers accepted the proposals of the 
Social 
Policy Commission for the reduction of the subsidy given to the 
Social Welfare Insurance Fund by 480 trillion zloties. The 
above sum will be allocated for the creation of a miscellaneous 
reserve fund for the Ministry of Labor. Investments in parishes 
[gminy] threatened by structural unemployment (for instance, the 
clearing of ground for the purposes of attracting potential 
investors) would be partly financed from this reserve fund. 
  The government acknowledged that in association with the 
lack of additional sources of funding for the budget, it does 
not see the possibility of financing the expenditures proposed 
by the Sejm commissions in the course of work on the budget law. 
  The Council of Ministers adopted a decree amending the 
decree 
on the matter of tarriffs on imports from abroad. 
  The decree has as its aim the specification of the 
requirements regarding the industrial assembly of road tractors 
for the haulage of trailers. In the customs tarriff in force 
until 31 December 1993 requirement was set for the assembly from 
imported parts of at least 1,000 road tractors, and carrying the 
entitlement to import free of tarriffs the parts for the 
construction of these tractors. 
  In the decree adopted by the Council of Ministers those 
enterprises will be entitled to import without tarriff parts for 
the assembly of road tractors which assemble at least 200 such 
vehicles over the course of the year.

  [Text] Warsaw, Feb. 15--The number of unemployed stood at 
2.9 million in January, up 2.4 percent on December figure, the 
Central Statistical Office (GUS) announced on Tuesday. 
  In January the rate of unemployment was 16 percent, an 
increase of 1.9 percent on December. 
  Also on Tuesday Deputy Labour Minister Jerzy Szreter told a 
press conference that the rise in unemployment probably had a 
seasonal character, and should be halted in March. 
  However, he feared that the anticipated number of unemployed 
of 3.05 million at the end of 1994 might be "threatened" unless 
more money was allocated for active forms of combatting 
unemployment. 
  Unemployment rose in 48 provinces in January with the 
highest 
growth in Chelm (by 6.3 percent) and Cracow (5.3 percent) 
provinces. The highest rate of unemployment was recorded in 
Koszalin (29.3 percent) and Suwalki (28.9 percent) provinces, 
the lowest in Cracow (7.6 percent) and Warsaw (7.9 percent) 
provinces.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky by Igor </F>
Uranic in Budapest; date not given: "The Bosnian Croats Are Now 
Victims"] 
  [Text] Dr. Geza Jeszenszky is one of the people who in the 
past four years has lead the young Hungarian democracy toward 
Europe, from which this country was divided by an "iron curtain" 
after World War II. Always pleasant to talk to, rationally 
interpreting political events, he shook my hand at the door to 
his office, saying "Good afternoon" in Croatian. I replied in 
Hungarian. This was the first long interview with him, and I 
felt that I should start from what has already become history. 
However, I skipped the first nine centuries of 
Croatian-Hungarian history. 
  [Uranic] Minister Jeszenszky, how would you assess the 
relations between Croatia and Hungary from the fall of communism 
to the present day? 
  [Jeszenszky] I think that every Croat and every Hungarian 
realize that these two nations and two countries have for 
centuries lived within one state and that this life together was 
not at all bad. It was only in the 19th century that there were 
serious controversies and tensions between the two nations. The 
relations were good -- whether we discuss the present, the time 
of the former Yugoslavia, or the time of the Croato-Hungarian 
Compromise of 1868, which was also not bad. Naturally, we could 
discuss its implementation. However, if I am to talk about how 
relations between the two countries have developed since 1990, 
then I would like to say with the utmost sincerity that I am 
very happy that another "compromise" has been made between 
Croatia and Hungary. This one was much easier to make, since we 
are living in two states. 
  Hungary never wanted to meddle in the relations among the 
peoples of Yugoslavia, but it also respected the will of the 
Croatian people when we realized that the Croats saw their 
future in an independent state. After Croatia established peace 
following a very difficult war, which peace is, unfortunately, 
still very fragile, political relations were established between 
Hungary and Croatia at all levels. Much has been done in the 
areas of economy and culture. 
  Unfortunately, economic cooperation is not as strong and 
intensive as we would like it to be, which the war is largely 
responsible for. For instance, you see that Hungarian tourists 
have understood this unusual situation of the war being waged in 
certain parts of Croatia, while it is possible to swim in the 
Adriatic in peace, so there have been many on holiday in Croatia 
in the past two years. I think that, generally speaking, 
permanent and solid foundations have been laid for good 
relations between the two countries and two nations in this 
period. 
  [Uranic] In your opinion, how does the war in the Balkans 
influence Hungary, and how does it influence the political 
situation in this part of Europe? Do you agree with those who 
say that "Europe is dying in the Balkans"? 
  [Jeszenszky] The war in the Balkans is undoubtedly a burden 
to primarily the Balkan peoples, the peoples of the former 
Yugoslavia. The neighboring countries also feel the consequences 
of the war -- naturally not the way the people of Vukovar or 
Sarajevo have felt it, but Hungary does indeed feel the 
consequences of the war. We do not see this war as an American 
who sees it all on TV and thinks: "This is far away. What is 
happening there is terrible, but the main thing is that it is 
not here." This war is close to us, and the Hungarian people 
have shown their solidarity with those who suffer by accepting 
refugees and through the significant aid offered by the members 
of the Maltese order and many others. Unfortunately, the war in 
the Balkans does indeed have a very bad influence on the entire 
region. 
  I am not only talking about these direct consequences. 
Looking from a distance, the war is here, several hundred 
kilometers away, in this part of Europe. More tourists and more 
investors from the United States would have come to Hungary if 
this war had been over. I will not say that this war could 
stimulate others to fight wars, but, unfortunately, it indicates 
that the use of force and occupation of territory have so far 
yielded results. It is, therefore, a very bad example to the 
entire world, particularly Central and Eastern Europe. I 
personally think that the events that have occurred there are a 
hard blow to the civilization of Christian Europe. 
  We know that war conventions have been in power since the 
last century and that they were mostly observed even then. Let 
me quote from a work of a great Hungarian writer Sandor Maroy, 
who said: "To be European means to believe that reason and 
solidarity are stronger than the tyranny of low passions." 
Unforfunately, we have seen that this basic principle of 
Europeanism was not actualized here. Moreover, I think that it 
should be in the interest of all Europeans, especially those who 
have been inflicted by the war, to stop the conflict and that it 
is their obligation. 
  [Uranic] Do you think that the UN action, which has so far 
been unsuccessful, indicates the international community's 
weakness? Should the keeping of peace be replaced by the 
imposing of peace or, more precisely, military intervention? 
  [Jeszenszky] Unfortunately, we can conclude that the 
international community has not been able to deal not only with 
the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but the entire Balkan crisis. It 
soon threw the ball in the European Union's court. After the 
mediation of the three failed, as did the very reasonable 
Carrington plan, the issue fell into the hands of the United 
Nations, and since then, I have seen much willingness to deal 
with the issue. 
  The UN countries are providing considerable amounts of aid 
for the people who are suffering. The fact is that hundreds of 
thousands of people have been killed in the war, but it should 
also be said that several dozen Europeans from the countries 
participating in UN missions have also lost their lives. Thus, 
they became a part of the suffering, too. I would, therefore, 
not say that either Europe or the international community have 
completely failed in the Balkans. We could have said there was 
a true failure if no efforts had been made to achieve peace. 
Unfortunately, there were no appropriate means; there was not 
enough political willingness to impose peace. The issue is that 
it is not enough to keep the peace because that would come into 
power when peace or at least some cease-fire has been achieved. 
  The United Nations has so far only been prepared to keep 
peace. The member countries were not prepared to take the risk 
for which military experts established would take an army of at 
least 100 soldiers to impose peace, but with the uncertainty as 
to how long such peace would last. We may conclude that the 
United Nations has learned from all this that, in fighting 
similar crises in the future, preventive diplomacy should be 
instituted on time. 
  [Uranic] There have been many accusations recently 
concerning Croatia's alleged military involvement in the Bosnian 
war. How do you think the existence of the Croat people in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina could be secured, knowing they are a 
minority, both in relation to the Serbs and the Muslims? 
  [Jeszenszky] The world's reaction to the events during the 
entire war have always been strong but somewhat late. The world 
did not pay any attention to the destruction of Vukovar and 
Dubrovnik or to the fact that hospitals and churches were being 
shot. Only later did everyone realize that the Muslims and the 
Croats were the victims in the beginning of the Bosnian war. 
However, when the truth did emerge, it took quite some time 
before the public started to apply pressure and stimulate 
activity. 
  It seems to me that the Bosnian Croats are really the 
victims 
at the moment. It is they who are threatened. I can understand 
that the Croatian Government and the Croat people are very 
worried about it. However, I also hope that we neighboring 
countries and the international community will find a way to 
prevent the threat of their extinction or exile and that not 
only Croatia will have to protect them. The question is whether 
Croatia has the power to protect them alone, and what the 
reaction of the international community to such attempt would be. 
  I do not know how much truth there is in the news according 
to which there are regular Croatian troops in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Even if it is undoubtedly aimed at 
protecting the Bosnian Croats, it could cause the imposing of 
sanctions against Croatia, which should be avoided at all costs. 
However, the Bosnian Croats becoming victims of ethnic 
cleansing or being forced to flee to Croatia should also be 
avoided. The world should not only watch what the Croats are 
doing; it should pay equal attention to all the peoples in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Uranic] To what extent does the delicate issue of 
Hungarians in Vojvodina influence the Hungarian policies toward 
Belgrade? 
  [Jeszenszky] It is clear that Hungary would like the 
entire crisis to be resolved, but it has paid particular 
attention to keeping up with the position of the Hungarians, as 
well as the Croats, Slovaks, and Ruthenians in Vojvodina. When 
ethnic cleansing was in full swing, so to speak, we were worried 
that the Hungarians in Vojvodina would not only flee because of 
poverty and forced mobilization, but also because of the 
possibility that some paramilitary formations could expel them 
and other non-Serb people from Vojvodina. A large number of 
Hungarians fled from there -- almost 15 percent of the total 
number. I hope that this is temporary and that the situation 
will improve. This direct danger has subsided in the past 
several weeks, which is perhaps because the radicals there have 
lost a certain amount of power -- this was shown in the election 
results. 
  Naturally, the economic situation has not changed at all. 
All we can do to mitigate it is to send as much humanitarian 
aid as we can. However, Hungary has not considered giving up 
certain principles to try to buy peace for the Hungarians in 
Vojvodina or their rights. I think that we have abided by a 
principled policy during the entire crisis and that we have 
worked on trying to retain good relations with all the peoples 
who are part of it, which we succeeded in with Slovenia and 
Croatia. On the other hand, the Serbs were condemned by the 
international community but, in that case as well, we keep in 
mind that they are our neighbors and that they will continue to 
be so. Bearing in mind not only the future of the Hungarians in 
Vojvodina, but also the long-term Serbian-Hungarian relations, 
we wanted to keep good relations with them, too. We did not 
introduce compulsory visas; we enabled the regular flow of the 
local traffic and so on. 
  However, at the same time, we believe that the concept of 
autonomy, which the Democratic Union of the Hungarians in 
Vojvodina, is their right. In that we do not believe that this 
is some special right of the Hungarians, but that this model of 
local self- management is one of the possible ways of democracy 
and coexistence in the Balkans and even further. As Croatia is, 
to my knowledge, prepared to provide minority rights for the 
Serbs, Serbia should provide a special status to the Croats in 
Serbia. 
  All in all, it seems to me that in the past few weeks, as 
recent events have indicated, the government in Belgrade has 
realized that what the Hungarians are asking for is not all that 
impossible. They have realized that it does not endanger the 
territorial integrity of Yugoslavia and that with that move, 
they could win some positive points with the international 
community and maybe even come closer to a solution for Kosovo. 
I do not want to be too optimistic, but there have been serious 
suggestions lately, primarily from Serbian President Milosevic. 
Andras Agoston was invited to negotiate. This is a sign, and 
the days and weeks to follow will answer the question if it was 
a tactical move or a political decision that could have positive 
consequences in the long run. 
  I sincerely hope that this will be actualized, and I would 
like to point out that during my stay in Belgrade, I felt that 
the government there was seriously prepared to make certain 
steps toward peace and that they will start serious negotiations 
with the Hungarians. The Serb-Croat agreement, which happened 
several days before, had to me been a good sign of "breaking the 
ice" and more than that. It showed that Serb-Croat relations 
had moved from a standstill, which is extremely important for 
us, because it means that there is no danger of another conflict 
in our neighborhood, which may open the possibility of the 
return of the refugees, the opening of the Adriatic pipeline.... 
  [Uranic] Hungary has achieved remarkable success in European 
political integration. However, many believe that this is not 
accompanied by a corresponding level of economic prosperity. 
  [Jeszenszky] It would be difficult to summarize the 
condition of the Hungarian economy in a few sentences. However, 
I think that the achieved level of transformation of the 
Hungarian economy is not at all bad. I would like to point out 
that our inflation has never reached the proportions that most 
of our neighbors have experienced; it is currently kept at 
approximately 20 percent a year, and it will be even lower. We 
have made a significant part of state property private and half 
of the capital intended for this part of Europe still flows into 
Hungary. I would not like to embark upon a rivalry concerning 
who is in a better situation -- us, the Czechs, or the Polish. 
The most important thing is that a lot of capital is arriving 
here. As far as I am concerned, let there be talk that other 
countries are better off, as long as the greater part of the 
capital comes here. Capital does not read the papers and does 
not listen to propaganda, but simply goes where it pays to 
invest. That is why I think that the success of the Hungarian 
economy is at a far more serious level than is commonly thought. 
  I recently visited Ukraine, and I went to the foot of the 
Carpathians. The Hungarians there are surprised at the people 
in Hungary complaining about the situation so much. Not only 
because things are much worse there, but also because they see 
how much is being built here, and not only concerning 
infrastructure. There is a large number of new companies, new 
technology is being implemented, apartments built. All in all, 
I think that we have achieved relatively good economic growth in 
Hungary. We have not achieved everything we wanted, precisely 
because of the general international crisis and the war. 
Nevertheless, we did protect the people from the economic 
crisis that has struck all our neighbors. 
  [Uranic] Hungary has accepted the "Partnership for Peace" 
plan. Do you think this was the most the West could have 
offered to the Central and Eastern European countries, 
considering the situation in Russia? 
  [Jeszenszky] Many say that this is less than we expected 
and that the West has given in to Russia, or at least shown too 
much consideration toward Russia. I do not think this is true. 
Hungary and other East European countries clearly want to be 
full members of NATO, and they would not mind this coming into 
power immediately. However, a long transition period would 
follow. The conditions in the Hungarian Army, in the economy, 
and the education of the officers would certainly not enable us 
to become part of this integrated military structure 
immediately. However, I do not claim that we could not have 
done more. 
  The United States bears a historical responsibility, not 
only 
concerning Russian-U.S. relations, but also for what course 
Russian politics will take. It was, therefore, motivated to 
make Russia its partner and thus encourage those who are 
positively disposed toward the West, the democratic forces. 
Hungary, Poland, and other countries therefore accepted this -- 
I would not say sacrifice, but waiting patiently. It is also 
best for us not to have to fear Russia forever and to have 
Russia not only stop being a military threat, but also start on 
the way of economic development, to continue being the source of 
raw materials and all its other potentials. We have a special 
interest in Russia becoming a large eastern market and in Russia 
and the Baltic countries becoming the center of Europe, as now 
they are its outskirts. 
  Therefore, if Russia and Ukraine stabilize and start going 
the way of democracy and market economy, we will be the first to 
profit from that. Hungary supported the "Partnership" under 
those terms. This is why we are not complaining. We believe 
that this is an achievement that was unthinkable a year ago. We 
have come closer to NATO membership and we have been given 
promises that this plan would lead to it. This depends 
primarily on us, on our handling of the situation, our progress, 
and our readiness to cooperate.

<H5>  Lifting the Sanctions Against Belgrade </H5>
  [Uranic] According to some sources, Hungary is prepared to 
support the lifting of the sanctions against the FRY. Could you 
comment on that? 
  [Jeszenszky] I think we can establish that over a year ago, 
the international community decided to achieve the desired aim 
-- the end to the war -- by imposing economic sanctions instead 
of carrying out military intervention. The sanctions have 
undoubtedly been effective. Serbia's economy has collapsed. I 
was there myself and I saw the direct consequences. Naturally, 
this is still a lesser price than having a city or people 
destroyed. However, it was no one's intention to make the 
innocent suffer the sanctions -- for instance, the Serbian 
opposition or the non-Serb population, which certainly did not 
support the policies that were to be punished by these 
sanctions. The aim of sanctions is not to destroy a nation and 
a state but to force them to change policies. The European 
Union has, therefore, recently made a proposal that mentions the 
suspension or lifting of the sanctions -- not unconditional, but 
in case those whom these measures relate to, that is, the 
government in Belgrade as well as the Bosnian Serbs, make the 
moves they are expected to make. Hungary supports this way of 
thinking. It should be seen if the Serbs, Croats, and Bosnian 
Muslims accept this within the framework of the peace plan. 
  The Bosnian Muslims have suffered a lot. I can understand 
their bitterness. They presently think that they have grown 
militarily stronger. However, I think it is clear that a 
military solution really does not exist. The Muslims may 
perhaps occupy several villages or maybe towns, but they can 
certainly not win against the Serbs. They will certainly not 
make it to Belgrade. Therefore, a peaceful solution is still 
the only solution there. 
  I talked to international mediator Stoltenberg and Romanian 
Foreign Minister Melesceu today. We have arranged to suggest 
that the neighboring countries of the former Yugoslavia hold a 
special session at the level of foreign ministers, at which we 
would discuss how we, the closest neighbors, can contribute to a 
peaceful resolution of the entire crisis. On the basis of the 
plan of the European Union and the peace envoys, we would seek 
the ways of putting an end to this war, and then, naturally, the 
lifting of the sanctions could follow.

<F P=106> [Article by Helene Despic-Popovic] </F>
  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, Feb 16 (AFP) -- General Michael Rose, 
the commander of the UN forces in Bosnia, has requested up to 
3,000 backup troops to oversee the ceasefire and 
demilitarisation of Sarajevo, a UN spokesman said here Wednesday. 
  UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman Bill Aikman said 
170 
reinforcement troops from the UN Nordic battalion had arrived in 
Visoko, 40 kilometres (25 miles) north of Sarajevo, and a 
British battalion of some 150 soldiers equipped with about 15 
armoured vehicles was on stand-by in the central Bosnian town of 
Vitez. He said the reinforcements requested by Rose would 
double the number of UN troops currently deployed in Sarajevo. 
  British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said Wednesday in a 
BBC radio interview that Britain would not object to any of its 
troops being transferred to Sarajevo. "It's essentially a 
matter for General Rose to decide if some some troops would be 
more useful in Sarajevo," Hurd said. 
  The troops would oversee a ceasefire agreement reached last 
week between Bosnian Serb and Moslem military leaders under the 
threat of a NATO ultimatum for Serbs to remove their heavy 
weaponry from around the Bosnian capital by midnight Sunday or 
face air strikes. 
  But Russia's special envoy to the former Yugoslavia, Vitaliy 
Churkhin, said in Zagreb late Tuesday that Russian troops would 
not go to Sarajevo to support the NATO ultimatum, which was 
issued over Moscow's protests. [passage omitted] 
  Aikman said that four sophisticated radar systems capable of 
detecting a mortar were also being sent here this week by France 
and Britain ahead of a NATO deadline for air strikes. 
  He said France and Britain are each supplying two radars 
that 
are expected to arrive in the Bosnian capital by Sunday, the 
deadline for Bosnia's warring parties to surrender their heavy 
weapons or face NATO air strikes. 
  In Paris, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe reiterated 
Wednesday that France was determined to follow through with the 
NATO ultimatum. He told a meeting of cabinet ministers that his 
trip to Sarajevo over the weekend was aimed at stressing that 
point to the belligerants, government spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy 
said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] At today's session of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Presidency, chaired by President Alija Izetbegovic, support was 
extended to the activities of the UN Protection Forces 
[UNPROFOR] in the implementation of the 10 February NATO 
declaration referring to the removal of heavy weapons to a 
distance of 20 km from Sarajevo and the placement of these arms 
under UNPROFOR control. 
  In connection with this, the Presidency accepted a total 
cease-fire and freezing the positions of all the front lines in 
the Sarajevo region. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army will observe 
this decision in full, the Presidency concluded. 
  The Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency upholds UNPROFOR's 
proposal 
to collect up all those weapons that remain within the 20-km 
radius of Sarajevo and deposit them in a part of Sarajevo 
airport temporarily controlled by UNPROFOR. 
  At today's session the Presidency voiced concern over the 
positioning of UNPROFOR troops next to the Serbian positions 
around Sarajevo. The Presidency fears that UNPROFOR troops 
positioned in such a way could in several localities serve as a 
shield for the Serbian positions in case of a NATO air attack. 
There is a realistic danger that in the case of NATO air 
strikes the Serbian aggressor would not permit UNPROFOR units to 
abandon these positions, and so UNPROFOR soldiers could find 
themselves as hostages. 
  Within the framework of these activities, particularly 
worrying are the statements by some lower UNPROFOR commanders, 
who are in various ways and, in the opinion of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency members, wrongly interpreting the 
NATO declaration. 
  The current positioning of UNPROFOR troops in [the Serb 
occupied Sarajevo suburb of] Grbavica is acceptable only in 
order to supervise the cease-fire and can have no political 
connotations, it was concluded at today's session of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency.

  [Text] Belgrade, 14 Feb (TANJUG) -- The Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] received 
with surprise and regret the news of the evacuation from 
Belgrade of family members of diplomatic representatives of some 
European countries and the United States, as well as the news on 
advice not to travel to the FRY or to leave FRY territory, given 
to citizens of these countries, a Foreign Ministry statement 
says. 
  Similar hasty moves have been made before in order to put 
political and psychological pressure on the FRY and to inflict 
damage on its reputation. These moves are completely unfounded 
today, as they were in the past, and do not make any 
contribution toward creating an atmosphere needed for a 
successful completion of the peace negotiations. 
  The Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs stresses that on 
the 
territory of the FRY, full personal safety and conditions for 
normal life and work are guaranteed for all diplomatic 
personnel, members of their families, and all foreigners. We 
therefore expect that these decisions will soon be reexamined 
and withdrawn, the statement says in conclusion.

<F P=106> ["Regular" interview with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus </F>
by correspondent Lucie Weissova on 15 February; place not 
given--live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Weissova] Let us turn the 
page and talk a bit about southern Europe. Yesterday you again 
described the possible NATO air strikes over Bosnia as unfair in 
human terms. However, in fact, it should be an action to help 
end fighting by forceful action. Can you clarify what you meant 
by this: unfair in human terms? 
  [Klaus] I said this in an open conversation on Thursday [10 
February] and yesterday. I have not repeated it. [passage 
omitted] Let us leave behind this hyperbole. 
  Of course, it poses the question first of all whether it is 
possible to reach some sort of stable solution only by military, 
or, to be more precise, by air attacks. We hold a certain 
opinion on this that is [word indistinct] at variance with the 
rest of the world. I think that today and everyday we 
repeatedly hear the opinions of politicians on one hand, and the 
views of military experts on the other, [the latter] saying that 
these air strikes could not be a lasting solution, [and] that 
after [air strikes], the army would have to move in. I admit 
that I believe in the analyses of military experts; they seem to 
me to be quite realistic. [passage omitted] 
  [Weissova] Prime minister, you called upon the Slovak Prime 
Minister Meciar yesterday [14 Feb] asking that the Slovak side 
withdraw measures complicating the import of the Czech 
foodstuffs. At the same time, you said that it would be foolish 
if we answered in a similar way and that the Czech side would 
not consider this. What are the Czech Government's intentions if 
Slovakia does not withdraw these obstacles? 
  [Klaus] When playing chess, I do not disclose my intentions 
after the first move. I am not going to tell you in advance 
what will be my second, third, fourth, and so on moves, as the 
other side can take various countermeasures. Please do not ask 
me for a ready-made script of our steps. We have to work on it 
alone and be prepared to implement it. If we demand a halt to 
any protectionism from the West as well as from the East, it is 
not wise to treat our neighbors in this way. Therefore, it 
seems to me that a one-sided action, same in kind--according to 
[words indistinct] tooth for tooth--is neither imaginative nor 
very wise. So let us keep the alternatives. 
  I would be very glad if the Slovak Government assessed our 
proposal in order to make it possible for this measure (?to be 
discussed) by the first meeting of the customs union, at which 
certain concrete rules of these relations are to be established. 
Unfortunately, I cannot say anything wiser to better. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Viktor </F>
Krejci; place and date not given: "Speculation About Election 
Date Is Merely Hypothetical"] 
  [Text] In his regular column, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus 
replies to topical questions from reporter Viktor Krejci: 
  [Krejci] The Slovak Government is planning to introduce 
special inspections of Czech goods at the border. This measure 
is evidently aimed at averting the Slovak deficit in the trade 
balance and the resulting dollar payments to the Czech Republic. 
Will the Czech side react to this? 
  [Klaus] [Slovak Finance] Minister Toth has been looking for 
a long time for some centralized restriction of trade flows to 
Slovakia, not only from the Czech Republic but also from the 
whole world, to prevent a deficit in the balances of trade and 
payments. He came up with this or that idea many times in the 
past, only to quietly drop it later. We can react only when we 
are notified of something through official channels. (Editor's 
note: The interview was conducted a few hours before the Central 
Customs Administration of the Slovak Republic announced that 
products without a certificate about their quality would not be 
allowed to enter Slovakia as of Friday [11 February].) 
  [Krejci] Interior Minister Jan Ruml is working on a bill to 
make the StB [communist-era secret police] archives accessible. 
Has the government come to an agreement on this, or is that his 
private initiative? 
  [Klaus] This issue has been discussed for a long time, and 
the minister of interior is reacting to it correctly, from the 
bureaucratic point of view. However, this matter has not been 
discussed as yet at the level of the coalition or the government. 
  [Krejci] Deputy Interior Minister Zeman said that local 
elections and elections to the Senate should be held on 19 
November. What is your opinion? 
  [Klaus] These are only hypothetical speculations on the part 
of the deputy minister. No talks on this issue have been held 
thus far and a decision is yet to be made. 
  [Krejci] Should the nationalist Zhirinovskiy arrive in the 
Czech Republic, or should he be declared undesirable? 
  [Klaus] Undesirable in the general human sense of the word 
is one thing and "persona non grata" as a technical term in 
international politics--that is, whether some person will be 
formally permitted to enter the country--is another. Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy definitely is an undesirable in our country. We do 
not need him here, do not have to listen to his views, and I 
assume no one is curious to see him. I am not clearly 
convinced, however, that we should also resort to the use of the 
term "persona non grata" in the diplomatic sense. There is a 
discussion on this issue going on between the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Interior. One 
consideration is whether, by resorting to some extreme bans, we 
would not actually give this man more publicity than he deserves. 
  [Krejci] The Czech-Moravian Federation of Trade Unions wants 
to submit a complaint to the International Labor Organization 
because the Czech Government is supposedly violating Convention 
87 on the free association in the trade unions. 
  [Klaus] This is an ill-considered and--the gentlemen trade 
unionists are free to feel offended--somewhat childish step. We 
should settle matters of this kind among ourselves instead of 
hiding behind someone more distant and stronger. The idea of 
complaining to some international organization that I failed to 
get my way at home rather reminds me of children at play: First 
I challenge some classmate to a fight, and, when he beats me, I 
go and ask the teacher for help. I find this approach 
absolutely unacceptable, disloyal, and wrong.

<F P=106> [Article by Frane Plancic: "The Door Is Ajar"] </F>
  [Text] Last Friday [4 February], Croatia again declared 
that it was prepared to join the "Partnership for Peace [PFP]," 
a NATO program for military and political cooperation. 
  The first unofficial declaration was presented in Vienna by 
Bekic, our ambassador to the CSCE, and it consisted of one 
sentence. The second declaration was made by Foreign Minister 
Granic, and it was a little more elaborate, but was again just a 
signal. 
  The third declaration, this time official and unambiguous, 
was sent from the session of the Presidential Council for 
Defense and National Security. It is worth quoting again 
because of that, but also because it is a complex task for the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
  "The Council has adopted the proposal to join the NATO 
program `PFP' and supports the intention of the Republic of 
Croatia to take part in the process. With regard to that, the 
Ministry has been entrusted with preparing the final proposal 
and taking steps to that effect." 
  The final proposal, therefore, is to be drafted by the 
Foreign Ministry and presented to the appropriate state bodies 
and other political factors to be finally reshaped. 
<H5>  Coordinated Admission Form </H5>
  The report makes it clear that the basic views of the 
president of the republic, key state bodies (whose leaders sit 
on the council), and of the leadership of the Croatian 
Democratic Community have been coordinated. Thus coordinated 
admission to the PFP process does not need to go through 
parliament, for example, or be reviewed and discussed with other 
parliamentary parties. Only the agreement between Croatia and 
NATO worequire this, and even then it would probably boil down 
to mere formal acceptance. As yet, no one has declared himself 
against NATO or for nonpartnership with NATO. 
  However, if drafting the final proposal is a routine part of 
the job given to the Foreign Ministry, preparing "concrete steps 
for it" is an incredibly complex part of the job. Moreover, it 
cannot be implemented without the participation of the Ministry 
of Defense, the main repository of all future implementation 
plans, then also of expert groups from other departments, as 
well as strong public support. 
  It is definitely not easy to predict what lies ahead for the 
Croatian delegation on the way to being registered on the list 
of candidates for membership of the PFP. Croatia is not in the 
position to have all the doors automatically open for it, but it 
will not have any doors slammed in its face either, although it 
does fall into the "high-risk group." The doors are closed to 
Serbia, for example, as it is involved in a three-year war 
against everything and everybody, but also because, from the 
standpoint of international law, it is a nonexistent country. 
The doors are wide open for Poland, for example, among other 
things, because it is doing a good job of meeting the political 
requirements, but also because its territory is strategically 
extremely important. 
<H5>  First the Center and Then South </H5>
  If Croatia manages to refute accusations of intervention in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, only the fact that it is still in a state of 
war will stand in the way of becoming a member of the PFP. But 
that can be "patched up" with a promise to integrate the 
occupied territory into the state system in a peaceful manner, 
provided that the obligation is accepted and guaranteed by both 
sides. 
  Until Croatia meets that condition, it could get into 
trouble 
walking both ways toward the PFP. On one hand, it would be met 
by those NATO members which think that a country in a state of 
war expects something that the PFP does not offer, and on the 
other, by those who accept Croatia but -- because of the 
principle of unanimous decisionmaking -- would hold back until 
Croatia's domestic problems were solved. 
  All this has resulted in Croatia officially committing 
itself 
to the PFP so late and has made it decide to leave some time for 
the Foreign Ministry to prepare the proposal and decide on 
concrete steps. 
  In the meantime, more and more East European and European 
nonaligned countries are being admitted to the PFP. Perhaps NATO 
headquarters is waiting to fill the quota for those countries 
first and then they will start seriously considering the 
admission of countries from the territory of former Yugoslavia. 
In other words, only when the problem of strategically the most 
important part of Europe -- its central plain -- is solved, will 
they deal with the south of Europe and with the European 
Mediterranean front. 
<H5>  Security Problems </H5>
  The assumption is that there will be no serious problems 
with 
Slovenia at that point, but that it will also start demanding 
safety guarantees in case the Balkan powder keg explodes. There 
could be some problems with Croatia's admission and a loud 
demand for mutual guarantees for a peaceful solution to the 
problem of occupied territory. But this would only be for those 
countries that already have such security problems or could be 
predicted as having some in the future, and thus would want to 
delay giving such guarantees to another country. 
  This variant (and there are other, easier ones) of political 
problems which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is facing and the 
fact that it is walking in both directions is an organizational 
and working "piece of cake" compared with problems that the 
ministry will have to deal with once it chooses how to get into 
the PFP. 
  The expert group for admission to the PFP, which will mostly 
consist of members of the upper echelons of the Defense 
Ministry, will have to have many members, and to be very mobile, 
diverse in specialities, abundantly financed, and authorized to 
participate in implementing foreign policy and defense strategy. 
If the group does not have the above characteristics, it will 
not be able to represent Croatia as a member of the PFP, whose 
demands reach far into Croatian state policy. That is also 
evident from the concept of the PFP and its inner mechanism of 
operation, which has only recently been publicly represented in 
some detail. 
<H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5>
<H5>  To Mons -- Brigadier </H5>
  Since the idea of the PFP being the best way to move 
eastward 
as evolved last summer in Washington, after the NATO summit in 
January organization preparations for functioning of PFP 
institutions and procedures were expedited. 
  The recently established Board of Directors of the PFP, 
directly supervised by the NATO Council, will be in charge of 
accepting signed admissions, members, and coordinating 
activities. 
  According to Undersecretary Wisner, one of the first and 
most 
important tasks of PFP candidates is to draw up a "Presentation 
Document." Croatia will use such a document to present to the 
Board of Directors those activities that it wants to engage in 
within this cooperation, and the forces and means it will place 
at the disposal of the PFP; Croatia will present the main goals 
of defense planning and plans for reaching common goals. In 
those activities, the Croatian Army can expect to be assisted by 
NATO experts, for that is the key document in which they will 
together determine the goals, the momentum, and the extent of 
the Republic of Croatia's participation in NATO activities. 
  The Board of Directors coordinates the work on a series of 
such "Presentation Documents," plans common activities of all 
PFP members, and assesses the progress of the PFP program 
according to political and military integration. 
  Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), whose 
seat 
is in Mons (Belgium), is entrusted with drawing up military 
plans. It is already planning the joint exercise, and the 
command and staff exercise is to come first toward the end of 
spring, while units would practise various common procedures in 
autumn. It was required that small-scale exercises be held in 
some East European countries. 
  Some rules have been established regarding planning common 
activities. It is expected that high-level political 
representatives will be accredited to NATO at its seat in 
Brussels, while military representatives holding the rank of 
brigadier will be accredited to SHAPE in Mons. With regard to 
that, an additional administrative network is being formed that 
will comprise a number of functions, from diplomatic to legal. 

<H5>    [Box, p 3] </H5>
<H5>  Three Main Goals </H5>
  Regarding the concept of the PFP, it is emphasized that the 
PFP has three main goals. The first is described as another 
step toward a safer Europe, as it spreads democracy to new areas 
and transfers strategic stability to the east of Europe. The 
second goal is developing NATO's capacity to respond to 
challenges that were hitherto outside the domain of the 
collective defense of NATO members. The third goal is to open 
the doors for new members. 
  Realizing that the first goal is politically extremely 
important and will bring extremely difficult problems. 
Primarily because the cooperation with the Russian Federation, 
according to Clinton, is first on the list of priority matters 
of national security. Fortunately, European strategists and 
realistic politicians are placing more and more confidence in 
"the artfulness of history," that is in the belief that 
overcoming the Russian obstacle (complicated by the Zhirinovskiy 
factor) can easily be compensated. In this way, other items from 
the priority list are to be realized more quickly and 
completely, and the first item is to be left for later. 
  Realizing the second goal would be done by means of a very 
tangible method. It concerns adapting to ways of cooperation 
among NATO members on the military level and beginning such 
cooperation this year on operations that are being opened up in 
the post-Cold-War period. 
  For the Croatian Army, for instance, this would mean that it 
will have to get standard NATO weapons and equipment, or at 
least compatible ones, and that it will develop systems of 
education, training, exercises, communications, etc. totally 
compatible with NATO systems. Apart from that "hardware," the 
Croatian Army will have to single out units, make plans and 
define joint missions together with members of NATO and the PFP. 
It is planned that those will originally only be search and 
rescue missions, help in areas devastated by natural 
catastrophes, ecological treatment of areas contaminated by war, 
or basing military forces, and, on a higher level of 
cooperation, peacekeeping missions in crisis areas in Europe and 
elsewhere. 
  The gradual implementation of the third goal, according to 
F. 
Wisner, political under secretary of the U.S. secretary of state 
for defense, has been globally determined for the next five 
years. During that period, some countries will gradually be 
admitted and guarantees will be given that there will be no new 
borders dividing Europe's east and west, but this will also be a 
period for the United States to assess the stability or 
irretrievablity of the democratization process in Russia. 
  During that period, very few members of the PFP can count on 
being admitted to NATO as full members. Paragraph 5 of the 
North Atlantic Treaty, which guarantees the total security of 
NATO members, will extend to those countries and their security 
problems only formally. 
  In spite of formal refusals to comment on what would happen 
with urgent admissions to NATO if "the Zhirinovskiy factor" or 
some other factor goes mad in Russia, it is predicted that 
countries thus imperiled will have to be admitted rapidly and 
almost indiscriminately.

  [Text] Warsaw, 15 Feb--Poland is well prepared for military 
cooperation with NATO, Field Marshal Richard Vincent, chairman 
of the NATO military committee, said today after his meeting 
with Piotr Kolodziejczyk, minister of national defense. 
  In a statement to the media, Vincent underscored that 
"Poland 
is an important and prospective partner" for the North Atlantic 
Treaty. According to him, the issue of Partnership for Peace, 
which was discussed during his meeting with the defense 
minister, is neither a substitute issue nor an attempt to avoid 
a direct response to the issue of Poland's membership in NATO. 
  In response to the question of whether NATO can make 
technical data and information concerning air defense systems 
available to Poland, Vincent said that all these issues are on 
the list of priorities for implementation within the framework 
of closer cooperation and bringing Poland closer to NATO. "We 
want to understand each other better at the military level; we 
want to create operational effectiveness for cooperation," the 
field marshal added. The aforementioned air defense systems are 
very important for Poland's security, but they are very 
expensive. 
  Kolodziejczyk said that Vincent "is encouraging us to work 
extensively on a review document, which we should start 
negotiating in Brussels soon," to conclude a bilateral agreement 
between Poland and NATO and to join the Partnership for Peace 
program. According to Kolodziejczyk, bilateral cooperation 
between Poland and the members of NATO is a "good start for the 
implementation of the initiative."

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi by </F>
correspondent Bujar Muharremi in Tirana; date not given -- live 
or recorded] 
  [Text] [Muharremi] Mr. Minister, you recently made an 
official visit to Greece and met your counterpart Papoulias. 
Was this visit conducted in the context of relations with 
Greece in its capacity as head of the EC Presidency, or were 
there other problems associated with relations and the regional 
situation? 
  [Serreqi] The meeting was not bilateral. It was a meeting 
held in the context of Albanian relations with the European 
Union. Of course, the Greek foreign minister presented the 
invitation, but on behalf of the EC Presidency. The meeting 
aimed at discussing the results achieved so far in Albania's 
cooperation with the EU and the prospects for this cooperation. 
  The meeting was mostly characterized by a real climate of 
understanding. I should stress that the results of the reform 
in Albania and those of Albania's cooperation with the EU were 
very positively assessed. Besides this problem, we discussed 
the crisis in the region, as well as joint programs of future 
cooperation, the PHARE [Economic and Reconstruction Aid for 
Poland and Hungary] and inter-EC programs. We also discussed 
other problems of a political nature. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. Minister, what was the attitude of the Greek 
side regarding the crisis in the region? 
  [Serreqi] In general, the positions were pretty far removed 
from each other. The discussion resembled the confrontation of 
viewpoints we presented in Geneva several days ago. Of course, 
we stressed two or three main points, such as that we do not 
consider the division of Bosnia into three ethnic units to be a 
fair and permanent solution that serves peace. We believe that 
the recent NATO decision, the final ultimatum, should be 
supported, and the Albanian Government fully supports it. Our 
positions were not consistent with those maintained by the Greek 
Government. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. Minister, at the news conference held in 
Athens, you were questioned about the Albanian Government's 
opinion on the stability of The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia. Can you please tell us something about this problem? 
  [Serreqi] That was not the question. The question was 
related to the Congress of the Party for Democratic Prosperity 
in Macedonia and the answer was very clear. The answer was 
this: Interstate relations have nothing to do with interparty 
relations. Albania has been very clear in its policy toward 
Macedonia. Albania has recognized Macedonia for reasons that 
are already known. At the same time, we will never stop until 
Macedonia guarantees all legitimate rights to Albanians living 
there.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Gjergj Zefi, Deputy Chairman of the </F>
Democratic Alliance Assembly and ALEANCA Deputy Editor in Chief, 
To Be Tried"] 
  [Text] Mr. Gjergj Zefi, deputy chairman of the Democratic 
Alliance Assembly and ALEANCA deputy editor in chief, was 
summoned to the Tirana Prosecutor's Office yesterday. 
Prosecutor Gezim Lleshi informed him of the initiation of 
criminal proceedings against him on the charge of "insulting the 
state." The charge arises over a statement by Mr. Gjergj Zefi 
published in KOHA JONE on 1 February, the day after the arrest 
of the journalists Aleksander Frangaj and Martin Leka. In this 
statement, deploring the unjust arrest of his fellow 
journalists, Mr. Gjergj Zefi employed the expression: This is 
not a state, but a band of mafiosi putting Albania in serious 
danger. 
  The Tirana Prosecutor's Office, which apparently now mainly 
spends its time reading newspapers, has initiated criminal 
proceedings over this expression. Gjergj Zefi has been ordered 
not to leave the cities of Shkoder and Tirana. 
  In connection with the charge and his expected trial, Mr. 
Gjergj Zefi declared to the press yesterday: 
  I am from Shkoder, and my two fellow journalists were 
arrested at a time when the entire public in my home town was 
waiting for those implicated in the crime of 14 January [murder 
of Democratic Alliance member Gjovalin Cekini] to be arrested 
and the covens that link the state officials, mafiosi, and 
professional criminals that are strangling the city to be 
flushed out. This is the greatest irony. Before Gjovalin 
Cekini's blood has dried, journalists are arrested! I therefore 
issued the above statement. I am thinking of the murder of 
Gjovalin Cekini, the systematic violation of the embargo by 
certain sections of the state, who use not small cars but huge 
tanker-trucks, and the strategy of terror and tension that these 
people invested with power employ in Shkoder and beyond. I do 
not know what else one can call a state that is composed of 
professional murderers, mafiosi, and state officials who throw 
their weight around however they like, and does nothing. I also 
have other facts that I will make public at my trial, which I am 
calmly expecting, in order to prove with unfettered powers of 
judgement that we are dealing with a band of mafiosi that is 
putting Albania in serious danger.

  [Text] President Zhelyu Zhelev has sent a message to 
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, the president's Press Center 
reports. 
  The message points out that Bulgaria's position on the 
crisis 
in former Yugoslavia is a consistent and principled one. 
Bulgaria opposes the direct participation of Balkan countries 
and countries bordering on former Yugoslavia in eventual 
military measures aimed at establishing peace in the region. 
  The Bulgarian president thinks that even partially lifting 
the arms embargo for the fighting sides would tend to exacerbate 
the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The message assesses the ultimatum of the NATO Council as 
the 
last and radical warning for forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina that 
do not accept the UN Security Council resolution and hinder 
peace negotiations. 
  In conclusion, President Zhelev expresses confidence that 
after signing the Partnership for Peace, relations between 
Bulgaria and NATO will enter a new and more sound stage that 
will also positively affect relations with Turkey.

<F P=106> [Andrey Rangelov report: "No Immediate Danger for Bulgaria </F>
Exists"] 
  [Text] There is no immediate danger of Bulgaria becoming 
involved in the Yugoslav conflict, even if NATO goes through 
with its threat to carry out air strikes on Serbian positions. 
This is what Colonel Plamen Studenkov, deputy chief of the 
Army's General Staff Intelligence Directorate, said in an 
interview with BULGARSKA ARMIYA yesterday. The statement was 
prompted by a report in a Sofia daily under the sensational 
headline: "Intelligence Agent Number One Is Prophesying War in 
Our Country." It is actually difficult to make any predictions 
or express opinions on future developments related to the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Colonel Studenkov commented. 
  According to the General Staff officer, our involvement or 
noninvolvement in Balkan events depends entirely on our 
country's future stand and policy, and on nothing else. 
  According to the colonel, Turkey is supposed to have 
deployed 
an air force squadron in Italy, as part of the joint NATO air 
force contingent controlling the airspace over Bosnia. 
Nevertheless, I am convinced that Turkey is not likely to 
participate in any armed conflict with its military force, 
Colonel Studenkov pointed out. He bases himself on the fact 
that in its recent history Turkey has always shown an 
essentially realistic approach to military conflicts, especially 
on occasions when the use of armed forces outside the country's 
territory was involved. 
  As far as Greece is concerned, that country not only opposes 
the aforementioned air strikes, but it even refuses to get 
involved in the Yugoslav conflict altogether. In addition, the 
Greeks would react sharply to possible Turkish participation in 
an armed intervention in Bosnia, according to the Bulgarian Army 
spokesman. Colonel Studenkov presumes that the outcome of the 
conflict will be clarified in the final days before NATO's 
10-day ultimatum on the withdrawal of the Bosnian Serbs' heavy 
weapons from the outskirts of Sarajevo runs out.

General Lyuben Petrov, chief of the Bulgarian Army General 
Staff, and Greek Admiral Khristos Limberis, chief of the Greek 
Army General Staff, at the Defense Ministry in Sofia] 
  [Text] A short while ago, in the ceremonial hall at the 
Defense Ministry, Army General Lyuben Petrov, chief of the 
Bulgarian Army General Staff, and Admiral Khristos Limberis, 
chief of the National Defense General Staff of Greece, signed a 
program for military cooperation during 1994. Here are 
statements by the two chiefs following the signing ceremony: 
  [Begin Petrov recording] This is a very specific program for 
joint activity at different levels by the military 
representatives of the two countries. It is fully in the spirit 
of the documents signed so far on friendship and cooperation 
between Bulgaria and Greece; it is fully in the spirit of the 
military agreement signed by the Bulgarian and Greek defense 
ministers in 1993, which is a very important document embodying 
additional confidence- and security-building measures further to 
the 1992 Vienna document, and fully in the spirit of the 
Partnership for Peace Initiative. [end recording] 
  [Begin Limberis recording, in Greek with superimposed 
Bulgarian translation] Today's signing of the cooperation 
program confirms the excellent level of relations in the 
military field between the two countries' military forces, and 
at the same time opens up new ways. We now face a further 
challenge to extend our cooperation with a view to serving the 
interests of peace. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Atanas Matev commentary: "....For Balkan States In </F>
Particular"] 
  [Text] Tension within NATO circles has been greatly 
escalating over the last two or three days and is growing to an 
unprecedented level. Naturally, it is related to the ultimatum 
against the Bosnian Serbs that was recently adopted. 
  Are the conditions of the ultimatum likely to be fulfilled, 
or will it become necessary for NATO to embark on its first 
combat actions since its establishment 45 years ago? If there 
should be some fighting, how are the military operations going 
to proceed? Should only air power be involved, or can we expect 
ground forces to intervene as well? If such an intervention 
should become necessary, which NATO member countries would agree 
to send their soldiers to a he Bosnian battlefield from which 
many would not return alive? The probable refusal of several 
countries, if not of all the NATO members, to send their boys to 
certain death would cause irreparable damage to the prestige of 
the organization, which was most widely propagated as a lever 
and source of stability in the world after the fall of 
communism? Is the loss of such prestige not likely to be a 
death sentence for NATO? 
  With the approach of the ultimatum's deadline, such and 
other 
questions are being increasingly frequently asked within NATO's 
leading circles. 
  It is strange but their answers should have been clear even 
as early as a few days ago while NATO was deciding what actions 
to take in Bosnia after the massacre on Sarajevo's market 
square. This is what a policy based on wisdom, rather than on 
emotions, should be all about. 
  Let us hope that NATO's policy regarding the events in 
Bosnia 
is based on wisdom, rather than on emotions. In the opposite 
case, not only is NATO's future at stake, but many rather 
dangerous things are involved, which apply to the Balkan states 
in particular.

  [Text] The strike of miners in the units of the Targu Jiu 
Autonomous Public Corporation, whose trade unions are affiliated 
to the Federation of Targu Jiu Mining Trade Unions Lignitul, 
continued today in a tense atmosphere, our correspondent Titus 
Stoichitoiu informed us. 
  On the plateau located between the Gorj Prefect's Office and 
the aforementioned Public Corporation, over 2,000 employees, 
particularly from the coal basins Jilt and Mehedinti and from 
Pesteana and Farcasesti mines, remained faithful to Miron Cosma, 
leader of the Mining Trade Union Confederation of Romania, who 
advised them to wait for messages calmly. However, at around 
1530 local a part of the demonstrators tried to force their way 
into the Prefect's Office. As a result of the incident, nine 
people who belong to the law enforcement bodies were injured. 
Further, the entrance to the headquarters of the Brown Coal 
Mining Public Corporation was opened by force. 
  According to our correspondent's report, the result of the 
telephone discussions held by Miron Cosma with the minister of 
industry, Dumitru Popescu, and with the president of the Chamber 
of Deputies Adrian Nastase, did not satisfy the demonstrators. 
At 1830, Miron Cosma read an ultimatum, which says, quote: If 
by 1500 tomorrow a government team is not sent to Targu Jiu 
Municipality for negotiations, I personally, accompanied by 
leaders of trade union and demonstrators, will go to Bucharest, 
unquote. 
  In a declaration published by the local weekly MESAGER, 
Victor Murea, mayor of Targu Jiu Municipality, stressed that the 
miners' actions are illegal and the demonstrators should have 
asked three days before the outbreak of the strike for 
authorization to occupy the area neighboring the Brown Coal 
Autonomous Public Corporation, which is public property. The 
mayor of Targu Jiu Municipality said that appropriate legal 
measures will be taken against organizers of the strike.

  [Text] In connection with the faulty organization of the 
meetings that were held in Bucharest and Targu Jiu on 11 and 16 
February 1994, with incidents in which 15 and seven policemen 
were injured, respectively, and during which attempts were made 
to enter by force the headquarters of the Ministry of 
Transportation, the Prefecture of Gorj County, and the Targu Jiu 
Lignite Public Corporation, the Ministry of Interior specifies 
as follows: 
  It respects the constitutional right on the freedom of 
meetings and participates, through the units under its 
jurisdiction, in holding such meetings under conditions of 
complete order in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 60 
of 1991 regarding the organization and holding of public 
meetings. 
  It expresses its concern and disapproves of the degeneration 
of such public demonstrations directed against the forces of 
order and the normal functioning of public institutions. It 
emphasizes that, in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 60 
of 1991, the organizers are duty-bound to take all necessary 
measures to ensure the progress of such public meetings in a 
peaceful and civilized way. 
  Any violation of the aforesaid law will entail fines or 
legal 
punishment, as the case may be, and obliges the forces of the 
Ministry of Interior to intervene to reestablish order and 
public peace and quiet, and to ensure the supremacy of the law, 
an essential requirement of consolidating the rule of law in 
Romania. 
  This communique was faxed us by the Press Service of the 
Ministry of Interior.

  [Text] This morning more than 2,000 miners from the 
Lignite Public Corporation, whose trade unions are affiliated 
with the Lignitul Mining Trade Unions Federation, gathered near 
the aforementioned company headquarters in their working clothes 
ready to go to Bucharest, as was decided last night. Although 
Miron Cosma, leader of the Confederation of Mining Trade Unions 
of Romania, initially fixed a first meeting with the strikers 
for 1200, he arrived there from Petrosani 40 minutes earlier. 
Miron Cosma said that two buses loaded with representatives of 
the miners from pit coal processing centers will come to Targu 
Jiu from the Jiu Valley after 1300 to decide on further joint 
actions. At the same time, he warned that no alcoholic 
beverages should be consumed, but failed to mention the various 
mining tools with which some of the strikers are armed, our 
correspondent Titus Stoichitoiu reports.

<F P=106> [Eugenia Cristea article: "Miron Mitrea Announces That He </F>
Will Organize Such a Strike as Nobody Has Ever Seen Before"] 
  [Text] After the staggering negotiations between political 
parties and trade unions aimed at forming a coalition 
government, in the end Miron Mitrea [chairman of Fratia National 
Confederation of Romania's Free Trade Unions, CNSRL-Fratia] 
stated clearly: "In fact, it is not I whom they had in mind for 
the position of minister of labor, but Victor Ciorbea [chairman 
of the National Confederation of Romania's Free Trade Unions]." 
From Ciorbea, we have learned that he is not willing to accept 
that position either, as long as the government coalition 
includes the Greater Romania Party, Democratic Agrarian Party of 
Romania, National Romanian Unity Party, and Socialist Party of 
Labor. 
  As a result of this, the CNSRL-Fratia, in an almost definite 
cooperation with the Alfa-Trade Union Confederation, takes over 
its duties. 
  "On 28 February we will hold a one-day strike and it will be 
seen not only in the paper or on the television," said Miron 
Mitrea. "Bread factories and bread selling stores alike will 
work only with a third of their capacity, refineries will be 
operating but will not produce anything, oil deliveries will be 
interrupted, drivers will not move from their garages, teachers 
will go to classes but will not teach, and the wood processing 
industry will stop its activity. The telecommunications will be 
interrupted every 10 minutes, road workers will block roads, and 
work will stop at construction sites. Enterprises will have 
strike pickets and nobody from the outside will be allowed to 
enter the factory. The idea is to prove our organizational 
capability and, at the same time, to prepare the ground for our 
future actions planned for March and April."

  [Text] Approximately 300 trade unions affiliated to the 
Agrostar Trade Union Federation, which represent the interests 
of workers in the state agricultural sectors, organized a 
two-hour warning strike this morning. During this time, work 
came to a complete standstill. This warning strike is the 
beginning of large-scale labor actions due to a labor conflict 
between the executive and the Agrostar Free Trade Union 
Federation, our reporter Marin Eftimie informs us.

  [Text] Answering a question asked by a correspondent of 
Radio Romania "Current Events Program" in connection with 
certain remarks that [Moldovan Prime Minister] Andrei Sangheli 
made about the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Romania in an 
interview that he granted to ITAR-TASS, Mircea Geoana, spokesman 
for the Romanian Foreign Ministry, said the following: 
  Romania is the state that supported from the very first 
moment and continues to support with greatest conviction the 
abilities, independence, and statehood of the Republic of 
Moldova. I do not wish to comment on the passages in which 
ideas from the recent speech made by President Snegur are 
repeated, because the viewpoints of the Bucharest authorities 
about that speech have already been presented. 
  As regards the need to consult all Romanians in case the 
issue of reunification of the two Romanian states becomes 
topical, to which Mr. Sangheli is referring, we believe that our 
position has not been correctly understood. If, at one point, 
this issue might come up, I believe that apart from the act of 
consulting the Romanians from the Republic of Moldova, it is 
absolutely necessary to consult the Romanians in Romania, that 
is, to find out the opinion of all Romanians. We do not see 
anything offensive in these affirmations, but only an act of 
expressing certain obvious democratic and political facts, said 
Mr. Mircea Geoana to our radio station.

<F P=106> [Second installment of Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik's </F>
report to parliament on 2 February: "Slovakia in the World"] 
  [Text] 
<H3>  1.2 Foreign Policy of the Slovak Republic and the Process of 
European Integration </H3>
<H5>  The European Union </H5>
  A substantial part of the strategic task of Slovak foreign 
policy in the relationship with the European Union [EU] and its 
member countries, which was the signing of the European 
Agreement on the Association Between the Slovak Republic and the 
EU, was fulfilled in 1993. Moreover, the process of its 
ratification has been initiated in the European Parliament and 
the parliaments of the member countries. 
  The transformation of the original association agreement 
with 
the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic to the separate 
association agreements with the Slovak Republic and the Czech 
Republic has been considered more a technical than a political 
issue. The talks required two official meetings of experts in 
Brussels on 15 April and 26 May 1993. The last round of talks 
took place as the agreement was ratified on 23 June 1993. 
Because of some technical problems concerning the translation 
of the English working draft into the other nine languages of 
the Union, the agreement was not signed until 4 October 1993, 
during the EU Council session in Luxembourg. 
  Thanks to the effectively focused diplomatic preparations, 
the association agreement was approved by the European 
Parliament on 27 October, when 297 of the present 302 deputies 
voted in favor of the agreement, three opposed, and two 
abstained. The Danish Folketing approved the signing of the 
association agreement on 9 December 1993. The original goal of 
having the association agreement ratified by the end of 1993 
could not be achieved because of the current situation--the EU 
has been preoccupied with its own problems, like the open 
question of the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty and also 
as a result of the technical obstacles connected with the 
translation of the association agreement into the EU official 
languages. It is expected that the ratification process will be 
completed by the end of November 1994 so that the agreement 
could go into effect on 1 January 1995. 
  Concurrently with the signing of the association agreement, 
the formal side of the succession of the Slovak Republic to the 
Provisional Agreement on Trade between the Czech and Slovak 
Federal Republic and the EC has been guaranteed (temporarily 
valid already since 1 January 1993 on the basis of the 
declaration of the Government of the Slovak Republic dated 7 
December 1992), whereby the framework has been established for 
the mutual trade relations with the EU until the association 
agreement is ratified. 
  The support for development of the political dialogue on 
various levels between the EU and the Visegrad Four [V-4] 
countries attracted great attention in 1993. One of the results 
of this dialogue was the approval of the document "Toward a 
Closer Association With the Countries of Central and East 
Europe" at the Copenhagen EU Summit on 21-22 June 1993. The 
European Council accepted the appeal by the V-4 countries for an 
expansion of their access to the EU markets. The Slovak 
Republic managed to reflect the concessions obtained by the 
decision of the Copenhagen Summit into the provisional agreement 
and also into the association agreement. 
  A joint committee of the EU Slovak Republic (Czech Republic) 
convened in Bratislava on 21-22 October 1993. The Provisional 
Agreement on Trade was used as a framework for the assessment of 
the level of the trade and economic relations, but the response 
by the joint committee to the conclusions of the Copenhagen 
Summit also acts as a great stimulation for the reinforcement of 
our position as an associate member of the EU. 
  Some of the highlights of the contacts between the Slovak 
Republic and the EU in 1993 were the reception of Slovak 
President Michal Kovac by EU Commission chairman J. Delors, the 
reception of Slovak Prime Minister V. Meciar by EU Commission 
chairman J. Delors, the association agreement signing by the 
Slovak prime minister in Luxembourg, and the participation of 
Minister J. Moravcik in the political dialogue of the EU troika 
with the associated countries in Brussels. Sir L. Brittan, 
deputy chairman of the EU Commission, and EU Commissioner H. van 
den Broek visited the Slovak Republic in 1993. 
<H5>  The European Free Trade Association </H5>
  The main tasks of Slovak foreign policy regarding the 
European Free Trade Association (EFTA) were completed in 1993 in 
agreement with the overall integration objectives of the Slovak 
Republic. The Slovak Republic became a successor to the 
Agreement on Free Trade between the Czech and Slovak Federal 
Republic and the EFTA countries by signing the succession 
protocol in Geneva on 19 April 1993. 
  The Slovak Republic paid a lot of attention to the expansion 
of cooperation with EFTA by means of active contacts (visit to 
the Slovak Republic by EFTA Secretary General G. Reisch) and the 
utilization of the EFTA offer of expert discussions related to 
the adjustment of the economic environment in the Slovak 
Republic to the standards of EFTA and the European economic 
area. The joint Slovak Republic-EFTA committee also met in St. 
Gallen on 23-24 April 1993. 
<H5>  The Council of Europe [CE] </H5>
  One of the most significant achievements of Slovak foreign 
policy in the field of multilateral cooperation was full 
membership in the CE. By the adoption of resolution No. 33/93 
of the CE Committee of Ministers and the signing of the Protocol 
on the Acceptance of the CE Statutes, the Slovak Republic on 30 
June 1993 became a full member of this international government 
organization. The Slovak Republic confirmed all of its 
obligations to the CE, and it supports the process of the 
formation of an integrated Europe by its participation in CE 
activities. 
  CE membership brought with it certain commitments in the 
sense of the fulfillment of the Recommendation by the CE 
Parliamentary Assembly No. 1201/1993 concerning the 
Supplementary Protocol to the European Treaty on Human Rights 
and Rights of Ethnic Minorities. The Slovak Republic promised 
to honor the principles expressed in the Parliamentary Assembly 
recommendations during the process of admission to the CE. 
  By its resolution, the Slovak Government entrusted the 
members of the government with ensuring the implementation of 
the accepted commitments specified by the CE recommendations. 
At the initiative of the chairman of the Foreign Committee of 
the National Council of the Slovak Republic, an ad hoc working 
group was formed for the evaluation of the current fulfillment 
of Slovak obligations toward the CE. 
  Following its acceptance as a CE member, the Slovak Republic 
accepted many agreements adopted by the CE. This applies to the 
acceptance by the Slovak Republic of the Agreement Against the 
Use of Anabolic Steroids, for instance, the European Agreement 
on the Protection of Archaeological Heritage, or the European 
Agreement on Cinematographic Coproduction (the last two were 
signed by the Slovak Ministry of Culture). Under the auspices 
of the Slovak Ministry of Justice, work is in progress on the 
ratification of the European Agreement on Prevention of Torture 
and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and on the 
acceptance by the Slovak Republic of Protocols Nos. 1 and 2 to 
this agreement. The Commission for the Ratification of the 
European Social Charter operates under the auspices of the 
Slovak Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs, and Public Works. 
  Thanks to the CE Support, a CE Information and Documentation 
Center (IDS) has been established in Bratislava in cooperation 
with the Slovak Foreign Ministry and interested sectors, which 
collects all CE documents and provides services to the members 
of parliament, the government, and the public at large. The IDS 
was ceremoniously opened on 11 October 1993. 
  Despite the diplomatic efforts by the Slovak Republic for 
the 
purpose of supporting the establishment of the CE Second 
European Center for Youth (ECM) in Bratislava, it has been 
decided that the Second ECM will be set up in Budapest. 
  The Slovak Ministry of Culture secured through the CE 
Cultural Heritage Committee a "Technical Assistance for Banska 
Stiavnica" project, in the framework of which the CE experts 
prepared a blueprint for the revitalization and reconstruction 
of the city. 
<H5>  Regional Cooperation </H5>
  The Slovak Republic has been accepted as a full member of 
the 
Central European Initiative [CEI] as of 1 January 1993 without 
interruption, following the demise of the Czech and Slovak 
Federal Republic. This was confirmed, in accordance with the 
agreed mechanism, by the spring meeting of CEI foreign ministers 
in Budapest. 
  The CEI priorities in 1993 were to focus, above all, on the 
development of the economic and cultural cooperation in the 
framework of specific joint projects. In the course of the 
year, however, because of the conflict in former Yugoslavia, the 
trend strengthened toward the reinforcement of political 
consultations and questions of ethnic minority rights compared 
with the original pragmatic intentions of the cooperation. 
  On the basis of the talks of the ad hoc working group for 
ethnic minorities, the Italian side prepared a draft document on 
the protection of ethnic minority rights, which was originally 
supposed to be adopted as a legally binding document at a 
special CEI conference. At their summit in Budapest in July 
1993, the prime ministers of the CEI countries authorized this 
group to continue their endeavors to draft a document on the 
protection of minority rights, but in an open form from the 
vantage point of the legal obligation. Because of the ongoing 
work on the document, the Slovak Republic is adversely inclined 
to the implementation of the concept of collective minority 
rights, a stand that corresponds to the development of opinion 
within the CE, as confirmed at the Vienna CE summit. 
  Despite our support for the CEI orientation in the direction 
of the development of the economic infrastructure by means of 
regional projects, the intended goals have not yet been achieved 
in those areas of cooperation that have been selected as 
priority ones by the EU and the EBRD [European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development] (power generation, 
telecommunications, transport, environment). The Slovak 
Republic has pointed out the unsatisfactory situation in 
financing the infrastructure projects at the sessions of the CEI 
Administration Board at the EBRD. The Slovak Republic has 
supported the idea of the reorganization of the administration 
system within the bank in the interest of an improvement in 
relations between the bank and its customers. 
  At the fall meeting of the foreign ministers of the CEI 
countries in Debrecen, the Slovak Republic favorably responded 
to the Italian initiative of a pilot project of establishing 
industrial zones, which would begin by a study and coordination 
of the legislative conditions for their implementation, first in 
Slovakia and subsequently in other CEI countries. 
  The focal point of the activity of the CEI working group for 
culture, education, and youth exchange, chaired by the Slovak 
Republic, was the realization of the project "The Year of 
European Baroque." This successful project, in the framework of 
which seven exhibitions were organized in various CEI countries, 
is to continue with three more exhibitions in 1994. 
  The regional association known as the "Working Commonwealth 
of Danubian Countries (PSPK)" associates 22 entities (federal 
countries, independent countries, provinces, regions) located in 
the Danube River valley. The Slovak Republic has been a 
full-fledged member of the commonwealth since 1991. 
  The Slovak Republic takes part in the cooperation in almost 
all working groups and subgroups through the representatives of 
individual sectors. The Slovak Republic chairs and coordinates 
the work in two subgroups--the "Territorial Arrangement" and the 
"Land Protection." 
  In 1993, the Slovak Republic was host to the fourth 
conference of the government heads of the PSPK member countries, 
at which the work of the PSPK was evaluated, and the orientation 
of cooperation was specified for the next year in the form of a 
recommendation. Within the framework of the conference, chaired 
by the Slovak prime minister, bilateral talks also took place 
with the heads of the delegations from Bavaria, 
Baden-Wuerttemberg, Upper Austria, Lower Austria, Croatia, and 
Hungary. 

<H3>    1.3 Relations Between the Slovak Republic and the 
United Nations </H3>
  One of the key areas of the activities of Slovak foreign 
policy in the multilateral sphere is the activity within the 
framework of the United Nations, to which the Slovak Republic 
was admitted on 19 January 1993. The principal precondition for 
working effectively in the United Nations was the complex 
succession to multilateral contractual documents held by the UN 
secretary general. 
  The Slovak Republic was substantially involved in 1993 in 
the 
area of maintaining international peace and security, above all, 
by its presence in various UN peace operations: 
  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]--former Yugoslavia, a 
logistics battalion of the Slovak Army, 419 men strong, is 
operating in the Daruvar region and should be expanded by 40 
more Army members by 30 December 1993 and another 141 on 28 
February 1994, so that the Slovak Republic will have a total of 
600 soldiers in this mission. 
  UNAVEM [UN Angola Verification Mission]--Angola--six 
military 
observers from the Slovak Army. 
  UNOMIL [UN Observer Mission in Liberia]--Liberia--ten 
military observers from the Slovak Army. 
  UNOMUR [UN Observer Mission Uganda-Rwanda] -- 
Uganda-Rwanda--five military observers from the Slovak Army. 
  UNGCI [expansion unknown]--Iraq--four members of the Slovak 
Police Corps. 
  The Slovak Foreign Ministry and the Slovak Permanent Mission 
to the United Nations in New York rapidly assess the 
applications by Slovak businesses for permits issued by the 
appropriate sanctions committee of the UN Security Council so 
Slovak economic interests are harmed as little as possible by 
the sanctions introduced by the United Nations against the 
countries that threatened or violated international peace and 
security. The Slovak Foreign Ministry OMEO [expansion unknown] 
prepared, in cooperation with the Slovak Danubian Navigation 
Lines, a list of Slovak monitors who will accompany ship convoys 
through Yugoslav territory. This list was approved by SAMCOMM 
[Sanctions Assistance Missions Communication] in Brussels and 
passed on for approval by the UN Sanction Committee No. 724 
(1991). Because of the economic losses caused by the UN 
sanctions against Yugoslavia, on the basis of Article 50 of the 
UN Charter, the Slovak Republic has asked the UN Security 
Council for consultations regarding compensation for the losses 
it has sustained. The Slovak Foreign Ministry, through the 
Slovak Permanent Mission at the United Nations in New York, has 
asked for the dispatching of an expert hired by the UNDP [UN 
Development Program] to assess the losses. The losses have been 
calculated in cooperation with the individual sectors and 
submitted to the UN Committee. On 26 October 1993, the Slovak 
permanent representative at the United Nations submitted a note 
to the Security Council chairman enumerating all Slovak losses 
caused by the sanctions against Yugoslavia, which was published 
in the form of Security Council document No. S/26648. 
  Within the framework of efforts to solve the problems of 
sanctions, several diplomatic actions have been taken in the UN 
system. The Slovak foreign minister emphasized in his address 
to the 48th Session of the UN General Assembly the need for a 
solution to the economic impact of the sanctions on the most 
affected countries. Similarly, following an initiative by the 
Slovak Permanent Mission at the United Nations in New York, the 
problem of economic losses resulting from the sanctions against 
Yugoslavia was added to the agenda of the 48th Session of the UN 
General Assembly. The motion was discussed and approved by the 
plenum. The countries affected by the sanctions pointed out the 
long process of the approval for export and transit permits for 
Yugoslavia. 
  Since the Slovak Danubian Navigation Lines is actually the 
body most affected by the problems resulting from the sanctions, 
operative consultations are taking place with its representative 
concerning a solution to the most acute problems. Since Security 
Council Resolution No. 820 came into effect, the Slovak Foreign 
Ministry carries out the entire process of the issue to Slovak 
businesses of UN export or transit permits for Yugoslavia. It 
also keeps in contact with the enterprises and provides them 
with all important information for the purpose of alleviating 
the damage. 
  Because of the situation in the Disarmament Conference, the 
Slovak Foreign Ministry continues to claim its right of 
succession to the CSFR in the Disarmament Conference. The 
Disarmament Conference membership is still frozen because of the 
unresolved questions regarding the expected expansion of the 
Disarmament Conference membership (the question of Iraq). The 
disapproval of the "parcel" method of admitting new members so 
far prevented a solution to the situation in favor of the Slovak 
Republic. 
  In the sphere of armament and disarmament control in 1993, 
the Slovak Foreign Ministry focused on promoting the interests 
of the Slovak Republic at the UN, where, by its work at the 48th 
Session of the UN General Assembly, it joined all of the 
significant activities, supporting peace solutions to problems 
and reducing tension in individual regions of the world, and 
implementing UN resolutions for a truce during the Olympic games 
and the year of Olympism. The foreign policy of the Slovak 
Republic also became involved within the framework of the UN 
system in solving the problems of openness in armament. In the 
context of solving the problems of openness in armament, the 
Slovak Republic submitted to the secretary general complete 
information for the so-called Register of Conventional Arms for 
1992. 
  In 1993 the Slovak Republic began the full implementation of 
the regulations of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Chemical 
Weapons. Arrangements were made for the participation of 
representatives at the Preparatory Committee at The Hague and, 
on the basis of its recommendations in accordance with the 
Slovak Action Plan, an interdepartmental Slovak preparatory 
commission was established for the implementation of the treaty. 
At this time, the introductory initiatives of this body are 
taking place, aimed at the final ratification of the treaty in 
the National Council of the Slovak Republic for the specific 
conditions in the Slovak Republic. 
  The Slovak Foreign Ministry enlists expert participation at 
the talks of the Government Expert Group regarding the possible 
control measures of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Biological 
Weapons, where a representative of the Slovak Republic acts as a 
member of the expert process. The Slovak Republic joined the 
appeal to call an assessment conference for the aforementioned 
Treaty already in the first stages of this initiative and during 
the 48th Session of the UN General Assembly. 
  In the interest of getting involved in the work of the 
institutions dealing with the issue of nonproliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction and rocket technology and the 
regulation of exports and imports of material, technology, and 
equipment with dual purpose, Slovak Foreign Ministry 
representatives took part in the session of the Core Group 
(against arms proliferation) in Oslo. 
  The Slovak Foreign Ministry, in cooperation with the Slovak 
Defense Ministry and the Atomic Energy Commission, organized 
participation in the session of the Preparatory Committee of the 
Assessment Conference of the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of 
Nuclear Weapons in Southampton. 
  In the context of this activity, the ministry gave its 
support to the endeavors by some countries to implement the 
validity of the treaty without any time limit. The Slovak 
Foreign Ministry prepared its concept of the issue and presented 
it at the session of the appropriate committee during the 48th 
Session of the UN General Assembly. 
  An important activity was the preparation of the 
participation of a government delegation, led by the foreign 
minister, in the session of the UN General Assembly on 2-6 
October 1993, appearances of the delegation members in the UN 
committees, and the arrangements for various multi and bilateral 
talks, above all, with the secretary general and other leading 
UN officials and heads of state delegations, participants in the 
General Assembly. The orientation of the work on the 
preparation of the trip and appearance by the Slovak Foreign 
Ministry state secretary in the UN General Assembly committees 
and talks with the UN secretary general deputies was similar. 
  The Foreign Ministry submitted at the UN General Assembly an 
application of the Slovak Republic for a reduction of its 
membership contribution to the UN budget. A reduction and 
adjustment from 0.18 to 0.13 percent is expected. 
  The question of the membership of the Slovak Republic in the 
UN Statistical Commission was also dealt with at the 48th 
Session of the UN General Assembly, and alternative 
possibilities were discussed for securing the UN presence in the 
Slovak Republic (the establishment of a UN information component 
in the Slovak Republic). 
  An important element of the work was the preparations for 
the 
establishment of a Slovak Permanent Mission at the international 
organizations in Vienna. 
  Many activities were oriented toward the sphere of 
specialized UN programs, particularly the following: 
  UNITAR [Institute for Training and Research]--in cooperation 
with the Slovak Permanent Mission in Geneva, the supply of 
information on the organization of courses on multilateral 
diplomacy in Geneva. 
  UN Graduate Studies Program. 
  UNU -- UN University. 
  Commission on Transnational Corporations. 
  Intergovernmental Working Group of Experts on International 
Standards of Accounting and Reporting. 
  EUREKA--the production of information on Eureka programs 
with 
the objective of activating Slovak researchers to participate in 
the top research programs. After the publication, specific 
information was provided to the interested parties. 
  Departement des Affaires Humanitaires--Geneva. 
  International Center for Family Studies. 
  Government Committee for the Physically Disabled. 
  Public Administration--the collection of information

towards the territorial arrangement and modernization of public 
administration, and arrangements for the participation in 
international actions by competent institutions, the dispatch of 
experts, the circulation of information on vacant positions 
within the framework of the UN structure to the concerned 
institutions and reporting job candidates from Slovakia. 
  Characteristic of the last third of the year, as well as for 
1994 and 1995, is the intensification of the work on the 
preparations for the Fourth World Conference on Women. For the 
Slovak Foreign Ministry it translates into a need for the 
coordination of its activities abroad, the methodical 
modification of and help in the preparation of the national 
reports for the Fourth World Conference on Women. It implies 
for the Slovak Foreign Ministry the need to coordinate its work 
abroad, methodical guidance and help in the preparation of the 
national reports for the Fourth World Conference on Women, and 
the preparation of the documentation on behalf of the Slovak 
Foreign Ministry sector. 
  UNDCP [UN Drug Control Program]--Among the important 
activities in this field was the signing of the regional 
laboratory Balkans Route [Balkanska cesta] project. The project 
is intended for use in the implementation of narcotics control, 
for the establishment and equipment of laboratories, for 
increasing their capacity, and for the training and education of 
their staff.

  [Excerpts] According to a report by the Press Agency of the 
Slovak Republic, Deputy Premier Roman Kovac and Foreign Minister 
Jozef Moravcik left the Cabinet meeting five minutes after it 
started. As the agency went on to say, according to unconfirmed 
reports, they do not intend to attend the Cabinet meetings 
before their position is clarified. Minister Jozef Moravcik is 
said to have taken his leave. Our colleages Dagmar Bazlikova 
and Michal Tvarozek interviewed the two Cabinet members late 
this morning. 
  [begin recording] Mr. Deputy Prime Minister, what is on the 
agenda of the Cabinet meeting that prevents you and the foreign 
minister from attending the meeting? 
  [Kovac] The prime minister's opening address included a 
number of accusations against us, and the prime minister asked 
us to leave the Cabinet meeting. Immediately after our 
departure, the debate of the regular 17-point agenda concerning 
privatization started. It was said that, if we did not leave 
the Cabinet meeting, the Cabinet would end its meeting and there 
would be a consultative meeting of some ministers--that is, a 
consultative meeting of the ministers excluding us. We complied 
with the prime minister's wish and left the Cabinet meeting in 
order not to complicate the course of their debate. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Tvarozek] Mr. Deputy Prime Minister, do you not perceive 
this as some sort of a psychological war--the prime minister 
declared that he expected that you would leave the Cabinet 
voluntarily. 
  [Kovac] I think that if we leave voluntarily it would be a 
certain admission of mistakes committed by us in our posts. I 
do not think that either Minister Moravcik or I committed 
mistakes that would lead us to the conclusion that we do not do 
our work properly. 
  There is yet another fact here: Because we, together with 
deputies' initiative [Alternative of Political Realism], 
proposed a certain solution to the current political situation, 
there is a question of whether the prime minister will make a 
decision about our future membership in the Cabinet or whether 
he will not make such a decision. He really has the right to 
choose colleagues whom he fully trusts. [passage omitted] 
  [Moravcik] I would like to add one thing. In his opening 
speech, the prime minister said that he would ask the 
Prosecutor's Office to investigate whether our course of action 
was in accordance with the law and whether regulations of the 
penal code might be used to deal with it. I would like to say 
that such a way of thinking is absurd because there is our 
parliament here to tackle political crises. That means that, 
when a way out of the current internal political problems is 
being sought, the solution must be sought through the 
parliament. This is the fundamental principle of parliamentary 
democracy. When we took our course of action, we acted fully in 
accordance with the Constitution. [passage omitted] 
  [Tvarozek] Shouldn't the current situation be characterized 
as a parliamentary crisis followed by a government crisis? 
  [Kovac] It is possible to say that the Cabinet will continue 
its activities only with great difficulty because all of the 
measures they will present to the parliament will pose 
considerable problems there. I think that a number of officials 
of the parliamentary parties have made statements on this issue. 
  [Tvarozek] Mr. Minister, according to a report by the press 
agency, you are said to be taking your leave now. 
  [Moravcik] To be honest, I would really welcome to have 
leave, from my personal point of view. However, these days it 
is not appropriate to take leave.

<F P=106> [Report on news conference with Peter Weiss, chairman of the </F>
Party of the Democratic Left, SDL, including recorded interview 
with Weiss by correspondent Ivan Samel] 
  [Excerpts] The political crisis provoked by the 
incompetence and unwillingness of the Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia [HZDS] to cooperate is gaining momentum. Peter Weiss, 
chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] opened 
today's regular news briefing with these words. 
  Apart from the present internal arguments between the 
opposition and the government, journalists focused on tomorrow's 
26th Session of the [Slovak] National Council and the proposed 
constitutional bill, submitted yesterday [14 Feb], to shorten 
the parliamentary term. At the end of the news conference, SDL 
chairman Peter Weiss answered some questions by correspondent 
Ivan Samel. 
  [Samel] Chairman, it seems that the political crisis in 
Slovakia is nearing a climax. What solutions are going to be 
sought by the SDL as it enters this period? 
  [Weiss] It must be said that this political crisis was 
provoked by the HZDS itself, through its inability to 
democratically manage the emerging different strands of opinion 
within the party and its leadership's subjective lack of 
readiness to cooperate with other political parties. I do not 
understand the hysterics that took hold of a section of the mass 
media when the possibility was mentioned of expressing no 
confidence in this government. I do not know why Slovakia 
should be in danger, as today's headlines in the REPUBLIKA note, 
just because one group of government officials would be replaced 
in the next elections. This would happen if a vote of 
no-confidence is passed in accordance with the Constitution. 
  After all, Slovakia is not Meciar, and Meciar is not 
Slovakia. Our premise is that it is first of all necessary to 
call early elections. This is the basic factor that would 
settle the internal political situation. The second condition 
to ease the internal political situation is, in our opinion, the 
passing of the large-scale privatization bill, in the form in 
which it was agreed with opposition forces. [passage omitted] 
  [Weiss] There are many considerations that favor the holding 
of the fall elections. First, it would not be good if the 
Slovak election campaign were to run in parallel with the 
election campaign in the Hungarian Republic, as the center of 
attention would shift only to ethnic matters and national 
passions could rise. Moreover, it is necessary to gain some 
time to correct the basic political mistakes and mistaken 
decisions of this government. If elections were to be called 
for June, there would be a permanent election campaign starting 
from February. It might lead to destabilization of the 
situation in society, meaning that all attention would be 
focused only on the election campaign and not on the resolution 
of the problems that must be tackled. 
  Finally, citizens should be shown that there are other ways 
of governing and modes of cooperation between political 
parties-- besides the model of one against everyone--and of the 
promotion only of one's own political view and interest.

  [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 17 (AFP) -- A UN-supervised meeting of 
Bosnian Serb and Moslem military chiefs scheduled for Thursday 
[17 February] morning at Sarajevo airport was cancelled because 
the Bosnian army side failed to show up. 
  French General Andre Soubirou, UN Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) 
commander for the Sarajevo sector, then went to the Lukavica 
barracks, the Serbs' main military base southwest of Sarajevo, 
where he briefly met with the local sector commander. 
  The UNPROFOR-supervised meeting was to have studied 
implementing the ceasefire and trying to establish a number of 
sites where heavy artillery of both sides could be placed under 
UN control in line with a NATO ultimatum aimed at ending the 
siege of Sarajevo. 
  Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic warned on Wednesday that 
the Moslem-majority Bosnian army did not intend to attend 
Thursday's meeting, saying it had met all its obligations and 
that the negotiations only concerned the Serb side. 
  In his meeting at the Lukavica barracks, Soubirou asked the 
Serbs to agree to 50 heavy pieces of artillery they had handed 
in being guarded by armed UN forces. 
  A Serb officer at the barracks, who asked not to be named, 
told AFP "armed guards are not needed here," but that 
"negotiations are still going on." 
  No UN forces were in sight within the compound on Thursday 
morning. 
  UNPROFOR warned the Serbs on Wednesday that all heavy 
weapons 
withdrawn in line with the NATO ultimatum would have to be put 
under armed UN guard before midnight on Sunday if they wanted to 
comply with the terms of the ultimatum and avoid air attacks. 
  In Naples, the commander of the southern NATO zone Admiral 
Jeremy Boorda told journalists that the warring parties in 
Sarajevo had a long way to go to comply with the NATO ultimatum. 
  "We are seeing some evidence of weapons being turned in, but 
we are a long way away from complete compliance," he said. 
  However, he said "progress in the right direction is 
encouraging," although he emphasised, "We need real compliance 
by the deadline."

  [Text] Jagodina, 17 Feb (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, 
president of the assembly of the Srpska republic, today 
expressed optimism with regard to the international community's 
standpoint that the question of demilitarization of the Sarajevo 
area be resolved by diplomacy rather than by bombardment, as 
envisaged under a NATO ultimatum. 
  I am optimistic -- Krajisnik said in his statement today to 
Jagodina Radio -- as I believe that the international community 
will realize that the Serbs have accepted everything that is 
required of them. 
  "We have agreed to the proposal that Sarajevo be placed 
under 
UN administration; we have accepted an agreement on the future 
organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina; we have signed with the 
Croat side an agreement on the cessation of hostilities until 
political solutions are found; we have agreed that our aircraft 
should not fly over Bosnia-Herzegovina; and finally, we have 
agreed that our weaponry be placed under UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] control." 
  "All this must be enough for the international community to 
realize who is cooperative and which side wants to put an end to 
the war as soon as possible. This is why I am positive that the 
European Union [EU] and the United Nations will find a 
diplomatic solution which will avert NATO's threat to bomb Serb 
positions. Otherwise such an act would be the grossest crime in 
the 20th century in Europe, as aggression would be committed at 
a time when the two warring parties, the Serbs and Muslims, have 
signed a cease-fire, and when there are no combat actions in 
this area." 
  Asked whether heavy weaponry would be removed 20 kilometers 
from Sarajevo or placed under UNPROFOR control, Krajisnik said: 
  "NATO demands that we withdraw our heavy artillery by 20 
kilometers from Sarajevo is in fact demanding that Serb units be 
disarmed. At the same time this means that the Serb side should 
abandon its centuries-old ethnic lands and hand over Sarajevo to 
the Muslim republic. We do not accept this as this amounts to 
capitulation. We are nevertheless willing to allow UNPROFOR 
representatives to control our heavy weaponry, which would 
guarantee that there would be no combat activities from our 
positions," Momcilo Krajisnik told Jagodina Radio.

  [Text] A meeting between Army General Rasim Delic, 
commander of the General Staff of the Supreme Command of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, and General Jean Cot, UNPROFOR 
commander for the former Yugoslavia, has been held at one of the 
UNPROFOR bases in central Bosnia today. The talks were attended 
by Brigadier General Vahid Karavelic, commander of the 1st Corps 
of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The subject of the talks was the UNPROFOR activity to 
implement the 10 February NATO declaration on removing Serbian 
aggressor's heavy weapons to 20 km from Sarajevo and putting it 
under UNPROFOR control. On this occasion, Gen. Jean Cot 
informed generals Delic and Karavelic about UNPROFOR activities 
undertaken so far on implementing NATO's decisions, expressing 
their total determination to bring to a successful conclusion 
the job that has been begun. 
  During today's talks, Gen. Delic pointed out that the Army 
of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will completely respect all the obligations 
that our country's state bodies have undertaken in realizing 
this significant task. 
  Apart from the talks on withdrawing the Serbian aggressor's 
artillery from around Sarajevo, also touched upon were measures 
that the international community and UNPROFOR should undertake 
to stop the offensive on Bihac, a region that the Security 
Council has proclaimed a protected zone.

<F P=106> [By Stevan Cordas] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 16 (TANJUG) -- The U.N. Security 
Council [UNSC] has failed to give the green light to NATO to 
launch air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, diplomatic circles 
in Belgrade said on Wednesday. 
  They interpret this by the fact that a decision was not 
reached even after the two-day Security Council session on the 
Bosnian crisis and the NATO ultimatum. 
  The diplomats believe that, in view of such an outcome of 
the 
Security Council session, the NATO bombardment of the Serb 
positions would represent an aggression, rather than a move 
towards a peaceful solution to the Bosnian crisis. 
  The (un)expected [as received] outcome of the session also 
means that Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali was not given 
permission to order the NATO air strikes. 
  China's Security Council representative openly said that 
Peking [as received] opposes the NATO bombardment. 
  In talks with British Prime Minister John Major, Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin said that a solution to the Bosnian 
crisis cannot be sought without Russia. 
  The diplomats in Belgrade believe that Peking's and Moscow's 
firm stands were clearly decisive for the outcome of the latest 
Security Council session. 
  In the meantime, the world has already started the countdown 
for the NATO ultimatum. 
  In NATO bases in Italy there are as many as 170 war planes. 
  Four more days remain until the deadline expires, but it is 
uncertain whether NATO will attack the Serb positions around 
Sarajevo without a direct Security Council decision. 
  Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, who was in 
Belgrade 
on Tuesday, said that the NATO ultimatum cannot be interpreted 
as directed only against the Bosnian Serbs. He claims that the 
ultimatum was given to all three warring sides. 
  Papoulias' interpretation is identical to NATO's decision to 
threaten the Bosnian Serbs and Muslims with air strikes unless 
they withdraw their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo to 20 km 
away from the city's centre. However, everyone abroad is 
speaking only about the ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs, while 
the Muslims and Croats are not mentioned at all. 
  Croatia also faces sanctions if it fails to comply with a 
U.N. demand to pull out its regular troops from Bosnia by 
February 16. 
  However, Croatia is hardly likely to meet this demand and it 
is even more improbable that it will be punished for this 
because some Western countries have already come up with reasons 
for Croatia's failure to withdraw. They are saying that the 
presence of regular Croat troops in Bosnia is good because they 
are "holding back" the Bosnian Croat forces.

  [Text] Jagodina, 16 Feb (TANJUG) -- General Dusan 
Kovacevic, defense minister of the Srpska republic, said today 
he "hoped reason would prevail rather than NATO's war option 
based on erroneous accusations and that the bombardment of Serb 
positions in Bosnia would not take place on 21 February." 
  "We have already taken military and other measures to 
protect 
the population, vital installations, and the infrastructure so 
that there will be the least possible damage if the threats do 
materialize," Kovacevic told Radio Jagodina in Serbia and added: 
"We do not wish the attacks to occur, but if they do we will use 
every means at our disposal to defend ourselves." 
  "We do not have a choice. We are not attacking anyone; we 
are defending ourselves, our homes, and our people," Kovacevic 
specified and added: "We have no reason for concern; we will 
effectively defend our positions and our territory with our own 
resources." 
  Asked what had tipped the scales in favor of halting the 
withdrawal of the Bosnian Serb artillery, Kovacevic replied: 
"We were ready to withdraw the artillery as prescribed by the 
ultimatum on condition that the Muslim infantry be placed under 
supervision at the same time." 
  "Since UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] representatives 
replied they were not in the position to do this, we 
decided--and they (UNPROFOR) agreed--not to withdraw the 
artillery from existing positions but to group it at certain 
points and place it under UNPROFOR supervision, and this 
solution was generally accepted." 
  "America can interpret this as it wishes, but we must make 
sure we do not put ourselves in an inferior position to the 
Muslims either through negotiations or wrong moves," Kovacevic 
said and stressed that possible NATO aggression against the 
Srpska republic would result in the escalation of the war that 
will not be extinguished easily. 
  "The world knows this; it also knows that NATO's attacks on 
our positions cannot be as effective as they would like," 
Kovacevic said.

  [Text] "If air strikes should be launched against Serbian 
positions in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Serbs will have 
no choice but to defend themselves. We realize that a NATO 
attack on our positions would be an attack by a stronger party 
on a much weaker one, but the Serbs have no right to capitulate." 
  This statement was made yesterday for Radio Kragujevac by 
Momcilo Krajisnik, president of the assembly of the republic of 
Srpska. "Although the Muslims, who rejected the peace plan, are 
responsible for the continuation of the war, the Serbs are being 
threatened." The only reason for this is that the political 
forces that support the Muslims are using the United Nations to 
conduct their politics financed by Islamic countries. 
  On the subject of the continuation of the peace talks in 
Geneva, Krajisnik pointed out that it is very difficult to 
conduct negotiations under the conditions of threats and 
blackmail. Peace should be established as soon as possible; 
weapons should be laid down, and all controversial issues should 
then be calmly resolved through political negotiations.

attacks Serb artillery round Sarajevo. The Serbs would also 
attack all Bosnian enclaves where UN troops are stationed, Serb 
General Milovanovic said in an interview with a Belgrade 
newspaper. This would be a kind of international massacre, the 
general said.

  [Excerpt] Cologne (DDP/ADN) -- A worker for the German aid 
organization Cap Anamur was kidnapped by Bosnian Serbs 
yesterday. The chairman of the organization, Rupert Neudeck, 
said on Deutschlandfunk Radio today that the man in question is 
a 32-year-old born in Sarajevo who has held German citizenship 
for a number of years. According to this information he was 
returning to the Dalmatian coast after carrying out relief work 
in Tuzla when the Bosnian Serbs kidnapped him from a bus 
carrying Norwegian doctors. According to available information 
the man is in good shape. 
  The German Government is making efforts through diplomatic 
channels to achieve his release. 
  Neudeck expressed the hope that the work of the aid 
organizations in Bosnia-Herzegovina could continue despite the 
NATO ultimatum to the Serbs. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Zagreb, Feb 16 (AFP) -- A UNPROFOR [United Nations 
Protection Forces] fact-finding mission has been unable to 
determine the origin of mortar fire that killed 68 people in a 
Sarajevo market earlier this month, an official of the United 
Nations Protection Force in Yugoslavia announced Wednesday. 
  The mortar shell which also wounded 200 other people on 
February 5 may have been fired by either side, Serb or Moslem, 
Canadian Colonel Michel Gauthier, who headed the investigation 
committee, told the press. 
  "Both parties are known to have 120 mm mortars, and the 
bombs 
to go along with them," he said. ``The Team has no reason to 
believe that either party does not have access to this type of 
ammunition. 
  "There is insufficient physical evidence to prove that one 
party or the other fired the mortar bomb. The mortar bomb in 
question could have been fired by either side." 
  The commission, which conducted its inquiry on the spot 
between February 11 and 13, confirmed that a single bomb caused 
the explosion, the single bloodiest attack on civilians in the 
22-month old Bosnian conflict. 
  The attack prompted the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation 
to 
issue its ultimatum Wednesday to order air strikes against the 
Bosnian Serb forces around Sarajevo if they do not neutralize 
artillery around the capital by midnight Sunday. 
  Bosnia's Moslem-led government immediately blamed the Serbs 
besieging the capital for the attack, while the Serbs charged 
that Moslem forces had killed their own people to try to bring 
new condemnation on the Serbs, largely seen as the aggressors in 
the war. 
  Gauthier, chief of the engineering section of UNPROFOR, was 
appointed head of the team comprising French, Pakistani, Russian 
and Spanish experts, by UN special representative for the former 
Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi. 
  The commission of inquiry was agreed on February 10 after 
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said he would refuse to 
take part in peace talks in Geneva unless it was appointed.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 16 Feb (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, 
chairman of the Srpska republic assembly, today told TANJUG's 
correspondent that the Serb side is "very disappointed" with the 
work of the UN expert commission investigating the massacre at 
Sarajevo's Markale marketplace, and that it will demand "an 
additional investigation and explanation." 
  "We have not yet received the commission's report, but we 
have been informed that it concludes it is impossible to 
determine whether the shell was fired from the Muslim or the 
Serbian side, and therefore impossible to establish 
responsibility for the massacre," Krajisnik said. 
  "We are very dissatisfied with such a report because the 
commission did not carry out a detailed investigation and make 
an in-depth analysis", Krajisnik explained, recalling that the 
Serbian side's demand that it not only establish whether the 
shell was fired and by which side, but also that a forensic 
study of the victims' bodies be carried out. 
  "This would have told us something about the nature of the 
injuries and answered whether a mortar shell could have killed 
so many people," Krajisnik said. 
  "Our demand has not been not met. This is strange and we are 
all the more disenchanted with the fact that the truth has not 
been not established, because we know the massacre was committed 
by the Serbian side," the Srpska republic assembly chairman 
underscored. 
  Commenting on the commission's explanation that some time 
has 
passed since the massacre, Krajisnik said: "I believe it is now 
a problem to gather all the evidence and ascertain the nature of 
the crime." "However, we cannot accept such practice," 
Krajisnik added, recalling that, immediately following the 
massacre, the Serbian side demanded that a mixed commission and 
then an international commission of experts be formed, but that 
there was too much procrastination. 
  "Many indications exist that the device which exploded had 
been planted, and doubts remain," Krajisnik stressed. 
  According to Krajisnik, a larger number of various 
international experts should have been included in the 
investigation, because this case, as he said, has grave 
consequences for one side -- the Serbian side -- and could have 
far-reaching repercussions on the entire peace process and peace 
in the region. 
  Recalling that the massacre has been a reason for NATO to 
issue an ultimatum, Krajisnik stressed that the report in its 
present form cannot be a reason for the rigorous threat against 
the Serbian people. 
  "We fear that at this moment, a few days before the 
expiration of the ultimatum, politics have had a significant 
influence on the results of the investigation," Krajisnik said. 
  Asked whether Serbian experts were included in the work of 
the international investigative commission, Krajisnik replied 
that a Serbian representative was not a full member of the 
commission, and was unable to vote, or in any way influence 
results of the investigation. He, as an additional member, had 
an insight into the work of the commission, could offer 
explanations, and inform them about the findings of the Serbian 
side regarding the massacre at Sarajevo's marketplace, Krajisnik 
explained.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 17 Feb (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic, 
president of the Srpska republic, and Fikret Abdic, president of 
the autonomous province of western Bosnia, have reached an 
agreement on the permanent cessation of hostilities and an 
orientation toward political negotiations. This is underlined 
in a statement issued today by the office of the president of 
the Srpska republic. 
  The agreement on a permanent cease-fire will come into 
effect 
at 1200 [1100 GMT] on 18 February. "This is yet another 
important step toward peace in former Bosnia-Herzegovina," the 
statement says. 
  Abdic promises to secure compliance with the cease-fire not 
only on the territory of the autonomous province of western 
Bosnia, but also on the left bank of the Una River, which is 
currently controlled by remnants of the 5th Corps loyal to the 
Muslim government in Sarajevo.

  [Excerpts] [Words indistinct] of the fiercest offensive on 
Bihac County, Karadzic's chetniks are not giving up on their 
aspirations to take Bihac, particularly since they have the 
generous aid of the greatest traitor of the Bosnian people -- 
Fikret Abdic. Following instructions from his superiors, he has 
set out to capture the left bank of the Una River. Artillery 
and tank attacks along the defense lines on the 
Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau, Hasin Vrh, and the Bihac front went 
on throughout the night, while artillery attacks at Bihac and 
the outskirts of Cazin intensified this morning. After 
yesterday's attacks in the Cazin-Velika Kladusa Commune, the 
so-called army of so-called Kladusa autonomy was somewhat 
quieter overnight, but it resumed attacking this morning. All 
this is an illustration of the peace in [Velika] Kladusa that 
Fikret Abdic claims he agreed yesterday with Karadzic [16 Feb]. 
[passage omitted] 
  As we report this, the chetniks have stepped-up attacks on 
the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau, and also on the demarcation 
lines with the remains of Abdic's rebel army.

  [Text] Belgrade, February 16 (TANJUG) -- The ceasefire 
agreement for the region of Sarajevo, reached by the Bosnian 
Serbs and Moslems, is being mostly respected apart from sporadic 
violations by the Moslem side, Bosnian Serb army sources said on 
Wednesday. Small arms and sniper fire was opened from Moslem 
positions on Serb parts of the city, primarily on the suburbs of 
Grbavica and Ilijas, the Belgrade Street and the Ilidza 
Hospital, the sources said. 
  They pointed out the fact that the Moslem side is digging 
trenches and building bunkers and other kinds of shelter. 
  Officials of the United Nations Protection Forces UNPROFOR 
[UN Protection Force] have over the past few days confirmed that 
the Moslem side was using the truce and the withdrawal of the 
Serb artillery to advance closer to the Bosnian Serb defence 
lines and dig up trenches there. The Serb side has asked 
UNPROFOR to prevent such activity of the Moslem forces. 
  In other parts of the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia- 
Herzegovina, the Moslem forces continued provocations against 
the Serb side. In the areas of Doboj, Teslic, Gradacac and 
Ozren in northern Bosnia, the Moslem forces opened fire on Serb 
positions from mortars and small arms and the situation was 
similar in the regions of Olovo and Kladanj in north-eastern 
Bosnia. 
  Moslem small arms attacks were more serious in the area of 
Brcko in the Sava River valley in northern Bosnia and the Moslem 
forces were especially active on the Tesliv front, where its 
infantry was launching attacks backed by strong mortar fire. 
  Croatian radio quoted Bosnian Croat sources as saying that 
there was no large-scale fighting between Bosnian Croats and 
Moslems on Wednesday. 
  In the area of Kiseljak in central Bosnia, a Moslem 
terrorist 
group attempted to make a break-through while in the Kiseljak- 
Fojnica region and the area of Zavidovici re-grouping and 
movement of Moslem troops was observed, the radio said.

  [Text] A meeting of the deputies of the Assembly of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina who have remained in Sarajevo was held today 
to discuss just one topic: the latest Geneva negotiations. 
Mediha Colo has the details: 
  [Begin recording] [Colo] At today's meeting of deputies of 
the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina who have remained in 
Sarajevo, Miro Lazovic, chairman of the Assembly of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, informed the deputies about the basic 
characteristics of the latest Geneva negotiations. 
  [Lazovic] [word indistinct] delegation persistently insisted 
that the only thing that should be talked about are borders, 
and, as he put it, not borders of future republics within the 
union, but of independent states, that is, a Serbian state that 
would have the right to form links with other independent states 
and above all with Serbia. Of course, our delegation kept 
refusing this, being of the opinon that one should remain within 
[changes thought] that the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina exists 
and that one should be talking about the internal setup within 
that framework. 
  It is interesting that even Owen did not persist in keeping 
to his plan, but offered our delegation the freedom to present 
its new ideas. These new ideas, that is, of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
(?with) 17 cantons, as had also been presented at our assembly, 
were expounded by Ivo Komsic along with the map that was (?in 
the hall) for the first time and that really caused much 
attention. It is interesting that Karadzic's delegation agreed 
to talk about (?it). On the last day, Owen's proposal to 
continue the talks on the Owen-Stoltenberg plan was nevertheless 
accepted, taking into account some changed situations and 
perhaps some new ideas, but this plan remains as a basis. All 
participants in the talks agreed with this and this is the only 
truth about the end of the Geneva negotiations. 
  [Colo] Miro Lazovic also expressed his opinion about the 
latest negotiations in Geneva: 
  [Lazovic] A small move has been made, a move in the sense 
that an atmosphere was created that respected these different 
opinions without any aggressive statements, above all by 
Karadzic's delegation. There has emerged a clear readiness to 
reach peace, that is, that it is necessary to stop the war as 
soon as possible. One more thing is interesting and that is that 
the awareness seems to be gradually prevailing that a global 
political solution must be sought that extends beyond 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Karadzic even presented us with an offer, 
demanding that we did not get surprised or laugh, to join 
Yugoslavia. We rejected this [word indistinct], that is, Haris 
Silajdzic resolutely said that we do not want to join a greater 
Serbia, but one may speak about Bosnia-Herzegovina as an 
independent and sovereign state possibly forming some links and 
relations with other states on the territory of the former 
Yugoslavia through the European Union or through certain 
relations and links for which there is a certain mutual interest. 
  [Colo] Many deputies present at today's meeting insisted 
that our delegation to future negotiations must exclusively 
present the policies that have been adopted by the Assembly of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which Assembly Chairman Miro Lazovic finally 
also clarified.

<F P=106> [Report by Enes Ratkuzic and Faruk Hajtac from Mostar] </F>
  [Text] Unfavorable weather conditions for carrying out 
combat operations and the significantly more energetic approach 
by the world factors, have obviously (?influenced) the behavior 
of the aggressor's military forces in Bosnia. Sporadic, or 
rather rare small arms provocations and a few mortar shells 
directed at the demarcation lines represent the main 
characteristics of the aggressor's activity in the operational 
zone controlled by the 4th Corps units in the past 24 hours. 
  However, no one seriously believes in the swift and 
permanent 
return of peace to these areas. Namely, despite the cease-fire 
and negotiations between the two sides in Medjugorje, the 
Ustashas yesterday continued carrying out their policy of ethnic 
cleansing by expelling another 10 civilians to the left bank [of 
the Neretva River]. Therefore, it is obvious that the Croatian 
side has not given up its infernal plans and the intention of 
making the area Croatian. 
  This has been Enes Ratukuzic and Faruk Hajtac reporting for 
Radio Television Bosnia-Herzegovina from the 4th Corps 
Information Service.

<F P=106> [Omer Vatric report from Mostar] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] It is very cold in Mostar, and 
it is freezing in people's flats as there is a real fuel crisis. 
There is no electricity for the eighth month running and it is 
uncertain when there will be any. There is no drinking water 
and no food has come into the town lately. No humanitarian aid 
convoy has come for days. There are increasingly shortages of 
medicine and those most needed are unobtainable for days at a 
time. There is a constant crisis with medicines to cure ulcers, 
epilepsy, (?hypertension), and many other diseases. 
  A special problem is the lack of fuel for the hospital 
generator, municipal vehicles, and other vital needs of the 
town. As the Mostar Commune War Presidency reports, it is 
already the fourth time that the Croatian Defense Council has 
turned back fuel that the UNHCR has tried to take to the 
hospital on the left bank [of the Neretva]. In a word, the 
situation in Mostar is critical and it is becoming increasingly 
difficult every day.

  [Excerpts] The Government of Bosnia-Herzegovina held a 
session in Sarajevo today. The session focused on the grave 
humanitarian situation. Mladen Bosnjak reports: 
  [Bosnjak] The first and key topic of the discussion at the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Government session today [words indistinct] 
the availability of food for the population of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. After the government's extraordinary 
session, when it was concluded that the humanitarian situation 
was so bad that it was threatening with catastrophic 
consequences, the delivery of food had somewhat improved, but 
then it quickly fell to its previous level. In some regions, 
such as in the Bihac region currently, the availability of food 
has become critical. The main characteristics of the current 
situation concerning the delivery of food were presented by Arif 
Smajkic, minister for refugees, labor, and social protection. 
  [Begin Smajkic recording] Refugees, displaced persons, and 
other socially deprived categories of the population today 
receive food amounting to 158 grams on average. This is about 
21 percent of their needs. 
  The picture is somewhat different in different regions. The 
availability of food has drastically deteriorated in the Bihac 
region, where meeting food demands fell from 41 to 18 percent. 
In Gorazde, it fell from 31 percent to 13.6 percent. A 
significant deterioration was registered in the Zenica region, 
where it fell from 28 percent to 13.8 percent. A negligible 
improvement in the situation was registered in Travnik. The 
rise there was from 8 to 13.2 percent. In Tuzla, it rose from 7 
to 11.6 percent. A somewhat more significant improvement was 
registered in Sarajevo, where meeting food supplies rose from 25 
to 38 percent per resident. [end recording] 
  [Bosnjak] Here is an excerpt from a report on the situation 
in different regions. 
  Mostar region: No UNHCR relief convoy has arrived in 
Jablanica in the last seven days. The amount of food that 
arrived in Mostar is insufficient in terms of quality and 
variety. 
  Zenica region: The situation remains critical. The greatest 
problems with the delivery of food were experienced in 
Zavidovici and Zepce owing to extremely poor roads. This 
renders the situation in these towns very bad. 
  Travnik region: The situation in this region is extremely 
difficult, particularly in Gornji Vakuf and the villages around 
Gornji Vakuf. 
  Tuzla region: The wider area around Tuzla is approaching the 
point where the delivery of food could be described as dramatic, 
because the majority of convoys come to this region from 
Belgrade and through the aggressor's territory. More and more 
convoys are being canceled. Meeting food demands in this region 
is the worst in the republic. [passage omitted] 
  The unfavorable situation in Bihac over the last 15 days has 
culminated in the total suspension of convoys for this town. 
Foreign Minister Irfan Ljubijankic also stressed the following: 
  [Begin Ljubijankic recording] In the last seven days 
hospitals have been fiercely shelled. Fourteen patients were 
killed as a result of this shelling. This is all being somehow 
overshadowed by events here in Sarajevo. Chetniks are 
exploiting the attention the world public is giving to Sarajevo 
and carrying out their activities there in the dark. I think 
that the psychological effect of air drops would be compelling 
there, perhaps more so than the actual physical effect. [end 
recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [CTK Washington dispatch: "United States: Paying Attention </F>
to Central and Eastern Europe"] 
  [Text] Washington--The formation of a high-level U.S. 
Government group to deal with the affairs of Central and East 
Europe was confirmed by Richard Shifter, a high-ranking 
representative of the U.S. President's National Security 
Council, in Washington on Sunday [13 February]. 
  In a speech at the outset of a conference on the trade and 
economic aspects of developments in Central and East Europe, 
which is organized by the Washington-based organization European 
Institute, Shifter said that this group would be headed by Under 
Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff. 
  Shifter, who is director for Central and East Europe in the 
National Security Council, declared that the formation of this 
group was the result of an overall revision of U.S. foreign 
policy carried out after the accession of Bill Clinton's 
administration. Following this analysis of foreign policy, it 
was decided that special attention must be paid to Central and 
East Europe, Shifter said, and stressed the significance of the 
success of political and democratic reforms in this region for 
the United States. 
  At the same time, he drew attention to the fact that no new 
financial resources from the U.S. budget could be expected in 
support of cooperation with Central and East Europe. The main 
issue is how to make optimal use of existing funds, Shifter 
said, and stressed, in particular, support of the private sector. 
  The decision to form the group for Central and East Europe 
was made about two weeks ago and is to meet for the first time 
within the next few days, Richard Shifter told CTK. 
  All important departments of the U.S. Administration will be 
represented in this group, including the Departments of State, 
Defense, Energy, and Agriculture. 
  The conference on Central and East Europe organized by the 
European Institute is attended also by Czech Minister of 
Industry and Trade Vladimir Dlouhy.

<F P=106> [Roundup of RUDE PRAVO correspondents' reports: "The Prime </F>
Minister Does Not Wish Dissection of the Difference Between His 
and Havel's Stand on Bosnia"] 
  [Excerpt] Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus (Civic Democratic 
Party) refused to describe his and the president's views on 
Bosnia as conflicting when talking about a solution to the 
Bosnian crisis before newsmen on Monday [14 February]. 
According to Klaus, the difference between his and Havel's 
statements merely lies in a sterner and a less stern 
formulation. The prime minister believes that, had one not 
started to "dissect" these formulations, the Czech Republic 
definitely would not suffer any damage. 
  Klaus is "fully convinced that there will not be any [NATO] 
air strikes." He characterized his view that the core to the 
settlement of the conflict lay in an internal agreement as "the 
sole correct approach." 
  During the weekend, President Havel supported NATO's threat 
of air strikes in the event of the Bosnian Serbs' failure to 
withdraw their heavy artillery deployed around Sarajevo by 21 
February. Prime Minister Klaus, on the other hand, said last 
Thursday [10 February] that the Czech Government and the Civic 
Democratic Party were afraid of an external intervention in 
Bosnia. 
  Klaus noted at his briefing on Monday that the situation in 
Bosnia remained a subject of discussion all over the world. 
"When we emphasize that the core of the solution lies in a 
domestic agreement and that any external involvement can only be 
a supplement, this is not, I think, in contradiction with 
anything [Havel says] and is the sole correct approach," he said 
literally. 
  Deputy Prime Minister and Civic Democratic Alliance [ODA] 
chairman Jan Kalvoda said on Monday, in reply to a question from 
RUDE PRAVO, that the [Czech Government's] position on the 
Bosnian conflict ought to be discussed by the coalition's 
Foreign Policy Coordination Council, which comprises, among 
others, the president, the chairmen of coalition parties, and 
the minister of foreign affairs. Prime Minister Klaus rejected 
this proposal the same day when talking to reporters. He said 
that a united stand on Bosnia was a problem only for those who 
were trying "to find at any price a contradiction where there is 
not any." 
  According to Kalvoda, the body for foreign policy 
coordination was established to deal precisely with issues such 
as this one. "In matters such as this, no constitutional body 
can implement a policy different from the coalition," Kalvoda 
said. Replying to another question from RUDE PRAVO--whether the 
government should adopt a statement of principle on 
Bosnia--Kalvoda said that it was a supremely political issue 
which constitutional body delivers its opinion on the matter. 
"However, any constitutional body should always do so on the 
basis of the coalition's decision. I do not think right now 
that the government should adopt a statement [at its next 
meeting] on Wednesday [16 February]," he said. According to ODA 
Deputy Chairman Daniel Kroupa, such a statement of principle 
could be adopted by parliament. 
  The statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 
Bosnia on Friday [11 February] is not a statement that would be 
changed from one day to the next, M. Skolil, chief of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs Press Section, said on Monday when 
responding to RUDE PRAVO's question of whether differences 
existed in the interpretation of the government's talks on the 
NATO ultimatum to Bosnian Serbs. "Our diplomats have been 
instructed in accordance with the ministry statement. It is not 
the task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to comment on a 
discussion that may be taking place among our constitutional 
officials. We present the official stand of the Czech Republic 
per se. It is the binding standpoint of both the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and the Czech Republic," Skolil said. [passage

Republic"] 
  [Text] Prague--The Slovak National Bank yesterday paid $51 
million--that is, 46 million ECU's--to the Czech National Bank 
(CNB). This is the amount by which at the end of January 
Slovakia exceeded its credit margin in the mutual trade clearing 
account. This statement was made on Nova Television by O. 
Kvacek, from the CNB Press Department. CNB press spokesman 
Martin Svehla, in response to a query from CTK, was unable to 
confirm this information. "There is still an imbalance in trade 
between the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The fact is that the 
clearing account balance with Slovakia has already exceeded 6 
billion korunas and that credit has been de facto granted by the 
Czech Republic at this level," said Ota Kaftan, a member of the 
CNB Banking Council. The credit margin was first exceeded at 
the end of last December. The Slovak National Bank settled the 
$43-million deficit ahead of time on 10 January. At that time, 
press spokesman Svehla described this step as highly 
professional. He emphasized that the debt payment took place 
without problems, in time, and precisely in accordance with the 
payments agreement.

<F P=106> [Speech by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus to the Association of </F>
Swiss Bankers in Wolfsberg on 31 January: "The Czech Republic's 
Transformation and the European Context"] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus delivered a speech on 
31 January in the Association of Swiss Banks' Study Center in 
Wolfsberg on general experiences involved in the transformation 
of the postcommunist countries. The speech, supplemented by a 
discussion, was delivered in German. The addendum on 
Macroeconomic Rules, published below, was not contained in the 
speech. 
  The subject of my speech is a discussion on the current 
epochal role of the postcommunist countries within the context 
of European integration. This role is characterized by a number 
of specific national traits and features; however, it also has 
its own general laws that are today better understood and better 
formulated and that will certainly soon be written down in a 
manual entitled "How the Communist System Is Being Transformed." 
<H5>  The Domestic View </H5>
  There are three prerequisites for successful transformation: 
  1. Formulating a clear vision--that is, a vision of a social 
order in accordance with our own ideals (the ideological role); 
  2. Creating a general consensus in society, which, of 
course, 
is impossible without "selling" this vision in a contest among 
political parties (within the framework of parliamentary 
democracy); 
  3. Understanding for the peculiarities of the transition 
period and then, in particular, for the ability of the political 
representatives to put into practice, decisively and 
purposefully and, at the same time, sensitively, flexibly, and 
considerately, the reform strategy following from this. This 
means with regard to the social sectors of the population that 
will, in the short term, have to come to terms with certain 
negative factors in this process (the economic role). 
  Of all of the postcommunist countries, the Czech Republic 
has 
made the most progress in this role, despite the unfortunate 
breakup of the state, which we really did not want. We have 
already achieved the following: 
  --we have established a party-political system corresponding 
to Western standards, including ideologically "well-defined" 
parties; 
  --we have won reliable support from the public (to date, 
there has not been a single serious conflict in the social 
sphere); 
  --we have formulated a sensible and very liberal economic 
policy; 
  --the Czech Republic has the lowest and most controlled rate 
of inflation (approximately 10 percent per annum); 
  --we have a very low unemployment level (3.5 percent at the 
end of 1993); 
  --we have a balanced state budget; 
  --despite the fact that we introduced a functioning system 
for the Czech koruna's internal convertibility, we have a stable 
foreign currency exchange rate (for 37 months now, since 
December 1990); 
  --we have a balance of payments surplus and rising foreign 
currency reserves, and our exports are increasing rapidly; 
  --the decline of the gross national product has been halted; 
  --we have attained a rapid pace in deregulation, 
liberalization, and privatization. 
  These are all factors that plainly differentiate us from the 
other Central and East European states. 
<H5>  The Obstacles and Twists and Turns of Transformation </H5>
  The results of the recent elections in Poland and also the 
political disputes in Russia--just to mention two 
examples--indicate that the transition process from communism to 
democracy and a market economy will not follow a direct route 
but will contain obstacles and twists and turns, and also that 
this process will take longer in different countries. In the 
West, the problems of the postcommunist countries are considered 
to be a consequence of the blocking tactics of the supporters of 
the old social orders. This is also the view held by a sizable 
percentage of the public in postcommunist countries. 
Unfortunately, these ideas do not correspond at all to the 
facts. Far greater obstacles to the reform process--of course, 
not so much in the Czech Republic as in the other postcommunist 
countries--are: 
  --insisting on a negative vision (unity in rejecting the 
communist past is a characteristic feature, however) without 
establishing a positive consensus (the result is extreme 
political atomization); 
  --a lingering unwillingness to give up state paternalism. Of 
course, satisfaction at the demise of political confinement and 
the bureaucratic restriction of economic freedom (especially 
private ownership) is clearly formulated here, but this is 
something else. Preference is still given to security (to a 
relatively high level of welfare) over the insecurity that may 
be caused by the greater risks of the results of a market 
economy; 
  --the illusions of left-wing intellectuals (constantly 
nourished from the West) about various "third ways," about the 
possibility of establishing a just and efficiently functioning 
world, and about the necessity of managing social processes by a 
so-called select intellectual elite; 
  --petty politicking instead of a realistic and pragmatic 
policy. The attempt to achieve the maximum political effect in 
the shortest possible time instead of a clear-sighted political 
strategy, and political gestures instead of everyday meticulous 
political work; 
  --a misunderstanding of the inevitabilities of the epoch of 
transition, inability to cope with reform strategy, and the 
incorrect choice of the sequence of the individual reform steps. 

<H5>    The Rules for Transformation </H5>
  I would like to mention in this regard a few basic but 
important rules for transformation. Any attempt to plan the 
individual reform steps in detail does not have a chance. 
Despite this, certain basic rules should be observed. My 
experiences tell me that we have to begin with a considerable 
dose of restrictive macroeconomic policy. This way, we will 
achieve the basis for liberalizing prices and liberalizing 
foreign trade and also, by reducing subsidies, a dramatic 
turnaround in the economic climate. 
  A country that does not initiate this macroeconomic policy 
at 
the very beginning of the reform process will, inevitably, find 
itself in a situation that I described four years ago as a 
"reform trap": This is a vicious circle of high inflation (or 
even hyperinflation), repeated devaluation of the currency, 
rising foreign indebtedness, budget deficits, and so on. I 
venture to claim that the CSFR was, and the current Czech 
Republic is, a country that unequivocally and without any 
pressure from outside introduced, deliberately and more 
decisively, these unpopular but essential measures. 
  Radical and merciless liberalization of prices and foreign 
trade is another essential measure. In this way, we will 
achieve: 
  --the opening up of markets; 
  --a market evaluation of property, goods, and services; 
  --changes in the former irrational modes of behavior; 
  --economic balance; 
  --and the economic entities at the supply side of the market 
will receive the right signals. 
  The exchange rate, at this point, must become a firm nominal 
anchor. It must operate like an Archimedes point for the whole 
economic system, the only stable nominal value for the economy 
that does not succumb to fluctuations. The currency, evaluated 
by its purchasing power parity, has to be substantially devalued 
on account of the enormous structural defects of the centrally 
planned economy, defects that manifest themselves in the form of 
a balance-of-payments deficit. 
  After the government has resisted appeals for help, 
subsidies, modernization, and demonopolization, it must commence 
a comprehensive process of privatization. This is the only way 
to achieve far-reaching changes, this is the only way to find 
real (and, therefore, responsible and rationally behaving) 
owners, and this is the only way to strike a meaningful blow 
against the attempts of bureaucracy to control the economy. 
  These basic rules for the course of reform are certainly 
neither original nor innovative. If they seem original to us, 
this is merely because they are often forgotten and ignored. 
<H5>  The Foreign Aspects </H5>
  All of transformation must be carried out at home, and, 
therefore, the role of the "rest of the world" is small. We 
need general political support, we also need guarantees for our 
external security, and we need financial support in the form of 
loans from institutions such as the International Monetary Fund. 
Otherwise, we "only" need our integration into the global 
economy. And this is far more difficult than it seemed at first 
glance. 
  Our former artificial economic integration--the Council for 
Mutual Economic Assistance--now, fortunately, belongs to the 
past. Economic relations within the framework of this 
integration did not depend on the comparative advantages of the 
individual member countries; therefore, they cannot be--at 
least, without exerting coercive pressure--restored. It will be 
many years before these countries are again financially and 
economically consolidated; therefore, it is impossible in the 
short and medium-time frame to bank on an increase in mutual 
trade. For this reason, the proposals from the West concerning 
increasing cooperation--for example, within the framework of the 
so-called Visegrad Group--are also groundless. Such cooperation 
cannot be created from above, but only--and perhaps only--from 
below. 
<H5>  Futile "Maastricht" Ambitions </H5>
  The Western world--first and foremost, West Europe and the 
European Union--has its own problems. These problems are 
characterized by the current unfavorable phase of economic 
development and by the excessive social burden of state 
interventionism. They also stem from lofty and, in my opinion, 
futile "Maastricht" ambitions, ambitions we can say of a 
unitarist or almost unitarist perception of Europe. This all 
leads--although the external rhetoric of West European 
politicians says otherwise--to less openness toward the 
postcommunist world. When I said a few months ago that, after 
the 1989 "Velvet Revolution" the West had hung up a "Do Not 
Disturb" sign, this was certainly an exaggeration and a extreme 
oversimplification. However, the continuing protectionism 
applied in multifarious forms represents a considerable threat 
to our transformation role. The East is often criticized for 
the nationalism of its ethnic conflicts, but I would like to 
point out that protectionism is also a form of nationalism. 
  The collapse of the Soviet empire created a completely new 
situation for us, and we are aware of this. Naturally, the 
collapse of the Soviet empire also created a completely new 
situation for the West. It also brought new uncertainties, new 
doubts, and new questions. We observe ambivalent tendencies and 
phenomena at both ends of Europe, which we cannot accept 
passively. We have to proceed actively against them. 

<H5>    Centralization, Bureaucratization, Lobbies </H5>
  In the West, we can also see: 
  --increasing centralization of the economic processes and 
the 
bureaucratization of everyday life; 
  --increasing activity by various lobbies asserting only 
partial interests, which endangers the entire community (new 
feudalization); 
  --the transfer of decisionmaking to an international level, 
the consequence of which is that standard domestic control 
mechanisms lose their function and that the key role remains in 
the hands of an unelected bureaucracy; 
  --a certain comfortableness in political life, a loss of 
political courage, and giving priority to one's own political 
survival instead of to fundamental decisionmaking, which is 
unavoidably associated with substantially greater risks; 
  --certain etatist thinking, ideas about an all-providing 
welfare guaranteeing state, while only a few people realize that 
the state can guarantee such a function only under the 
precondition that its citizens surrender a major part of their 
freedom. 
<H5>  A Challenge for the Whole of Europe </H5>
  Resolving these problems presented by the new situation is a 
challenge for all of us--in the West and in the East. 
  During those periods in which Europe was not fatefully 
divided, it always represented unity in abundance. The vision 
of European union in the sense of unification was always, in the 
better instance, a utopia, a dream bearing no relation to 
reality. In the worse instance, for example, in its 
"Napoleonic" variant, it involved an attempt by the larger 
powers to assert a European hegemony. Such solutions were 
always short-term ones, and they were always characterized by 
the use of force. 
  T. G. Masaryk, the first president of the Czechoslovak 
Republic before World War II, wrote the following about this 
problem in 1922: 
  "The issue in Europe involves creating harmony between 
centralist and autonomist forces. Europe's unity consists of 
this harmony. However, unity is not just homogeneity. Europe is 
characterized by its ethnic and cultural differences. This 
variety was formed by thousands of years of development; 
therefore, European unity must be realized, first and foremost, 
in accordance with the historical principle and, apart from 
this, of course, in accordance with the given natural national 
and other differences." Masaryk, in the 1920's, considered the 
so-called Balkanization of Europe to be a great 
oversimplification. According to him, the issue in fact 
involved a historical process and an attempt by entire nations 
and countries to intensify their whole political and cultural 
life. 
  The following conclusions are drawn from this: The current 
changes in Europe create the need for a new analysis about what 
Europe is and what Europe should be. 
  Europe, whether we like it or not, was opened up to the East 
by the collapse of the communist bloc. Europe was in fact 
expanded and it must now react to this new situation. The idea 
that the postcommunist countries will gradually be 
"Europeanized" and the promises that they will then be able to 
be gradually integrated into an unchanged West Europe are 
inadequate and, in principle, false. We need a new vision and 
new initiatives. Truly meaningful European cooperation can only 
take place on the basis of openness and mutuality, and that is 
something that we in the postcommunist countries perceive and 
see only inadequately. We are prepared to take an active part 
in this work, and we believe that we will be given an 
opportunity for this. 
<H5>  Macroeconomic Rules </H5>
  Finding the right time to change economic policy 
administration from a restrictive to a neutral or even an 
expansive policy is a very difficult task. During the radical 
transformation process, the economy is anything but a 
homogeneous unit. For this reason, the turning point on the 
aggregate supply curve--from the horizontal to the vertical part 
of the curve--is very acute and lies far below the level of full 
employment. Although in this situation there is considerable 
pressure to artificially stimulate the economy, we must resist 
it. 
  In the first two years of our transformation, before and 
immediately after liberalizing prices, we asserted a restrictive 
policy with the state budget surpluses, and only then did we 
turn toward a neutral macroeconomic administration with a 
balanced state budget. We are sticking to this line today. 
According to my estimates, not one of the reforming East 
European countries has yet reached the stage at which liberating 
fiscal and monetary policy and initiating a Keynesian 
demand-oriented policy would be warranted. 
  The unavoidable inflationary response following price 
liberalization must be announced in advance, explained, and 
defended, and, first and foremost, the political leadership must 
"survive" it. The initial price increases depend on the 
inherited level of macroeconomic imbalance; on the whole, it was 
slight in the CSFR and huge in Poland, Russia, and the other 
successor states to the USSR. On the other hand, the dynamism of 
prices later in the reform process is determined by the extent 
of the restrictions on finance and monetary policy. 
  In the CSFR's case, the rise in prices a month after the 
start of the reforms was a "mere" 25 percent. In the ensuing 
three months, the rate of inflation stabilized at 7.0 percent, 
4.5 percent, and 2.0 percent, and, during the next 20 months 
(right up to the introduction of the value-added tax), hovered 
at just under 1.0 percent per month. In the other reforming 
countries, there were--and still are--considerable fluctuations 
in the rate of inflation with repeated phases of a more rapid 
and then a slower rise in prices, for which the mistakes in 
macroeconomic policy are responsible. 
  This policy can only hope to succeed if two aspects leading 
to the vicious circle can be limited: the price-wage and 
inflation-devaluation spirals. On the basis of our experiences, 
the two phenomena are closely associated with unforced errors in 
economic policy. During the phase of macroeconomic restrictions 
(1990-91), wages in our country were kept below the level of the 
general increase in prices. During the "neutral policy" phase 
(1992-93), wages rose rather faster than prices, while no 
serious problems arose from this; wages did not lose contact 
with the other pan-economic variable quantities. 
  The same applies for the connections between inflation and 
the exchange rate. Reforming countries are, as a rule, 
confronted with a considerable macroeconomic imbalance (the 
consequence of which is unavoidable rapid price increases), 
overvalued currencies (with considerable payment deficits and 
exhausted foreign currency reserves), and high state budget 
deficits (the consequence of an inadequate restrictive policy). 
At the same time, reforming countries do not sufficiently 
devalue their currencies. The result of this is that, given 
increasing domestic prices, exports decline and imports rise. 
This leads to a worsening of the balance of payments situation, 
which necessitates further devaluation and so leads to the 
import of inflation. This in turn stimulates a rise in domestic 
prices, which leads to the vicious circle. 
  In our country, the situation is and was different. The 
original inherited macroeconomic imbalance was slight, economic 
policy was cautious and oriented restrictively, and the 
devaluation, as it turned out, was sufficient. The substantial 
devaluation created enough scope for essential prices and costs' 
adaptation in the ensuing period. It seems that it is possible 
to avoid the danger of the vicious economic circle--under the 
precondition that economic policy pursues a sensible course.
