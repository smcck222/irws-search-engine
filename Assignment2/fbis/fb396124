  [Text] Juan Schiaretti, Santiago del Estero's federal 
trustee, said that "social peace has been reestablished" in the 
province. Schiaretti said that the protest march carried out by 
state workers and teachers on 16 February "does not represent 
the majority of the Santiago people's feelings." 
  The acting head of Santiago's Executive Branch said his 
administration "has paid all public administration workers' back 
salaries," adding that "the financial situation is being 
balanced." 
  Schiaretti denied the existence of any "social unrest" in 
the 
province, adding that the fact that on 16 February there were 
"1,000 people on the streets does not mean they represent the 
entire community's feelings, particularly considering that 
40,000 people demonstrated during the original outburst. [no 
closing quotation mark as published] 
  The trustee made these remarks at government house following 
a meeting with Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf to analyze the 
province's political situation. 
  Asked about the incidents the day before between police and 
workers who were peacefully occupying a textile plant and which 
ended with eight people wounded, Schiaretti said he regretted 
what happened, stressing that the "police action followed a 
court eviction order." 
  Regarding the beginning of the school year Schiaretti said 
"classes will begin in March as scheduled." 
  Meanwhile, the provincial front of struggling unions called 
for a mobilization on 26 February to reject the salary policy 
implemented by the trustee, while secondary and university 
teachers announced that they will not go to work until their 
demands are answered. 
  The front insisted that it will present 20,000 signatures 
requesting the repeal of the comprehensive adjustment law [ley 
omnibus de ajuste] while the CGT [General Confederation of 
Labor] regional unit offered their "unrestricted support to the 
struggle of local trade unions." 
  The 26 February march will be the second organized by 
workers 
against measures adopted by the trustee. The first one was 
carried out on 16 February.

  [Excerpt] Soon after its failed attempt to reach an 
agreement with the Socialist Unity, the Grand Front of this 
capital yesterday presented its candidates for the national 
constituent assembly. The candidates were presented in the 
Pasos Perdidos Hall of the Chamber of Deputies. The speaker is 
Deputy Carlos "Chacho" Alvarez, whose name is at the top of the 
list. 
  Alvarez said: "Our candidates want to guarantee that the new 
Constitution will strengthen democracy, establish new rights, 
and recover a judicial system totally independent from political 
power." He criticized the administration of President Menem, and 
did not spare the Radical Civic Union; he spoke of the "ethic 
submission" of this political party and of the need for the 
Grand Front to become an election alternative in the district. 
  Indeed, one paragraph of the document released yesterday 
states: "We will be the only alternative to the single party 
system that seeks reelection through the Menem-Alfonsin pact." 
After reading the document, Alvarez presented the candidates. 
  The second name in the list is Anibal Ibarra, councilman and 
former prosecutor, followed by Deputy Graciela Fernandez Meijide 
and lawyer Raul Eugenio Zaffaroni. Given the public activity of 
Ibarra and Zaffaroni, Alvarez said that the Grand Front "seeks 
to struggle in the assembly in favor of a system of justice 
really independent from Menemist corruption." 
  Next on the list are Eduardo Barcessat, Adriana Puiggros, 
Alicia Oliveira, a former member of the CELS [Center for Legal 
and Social Studies], and Jose Miguez Bonino, from the Permanent 
Human Rights Association. Alvarez described Puiggros as an 
"expert on education and science." He took the opportunity to 
criticize the Olivos pact, saying: "That pact has also forgotten 
education, which is why we included it on the list," he said.

  [Text] (DYN-NA) -- The row over the leak of confidential 
information by members of the economic team in 1991 took another 
turn yesterday when lawyer Ricardo Monner Sans commenced legal 
action against all the main players in the scandal. 
  The lawyer started his criminal lawsuit against Economy 
Minister Domingo Cavallo, City Mayor Sau Bouer and economist 
Miguel Angel Broda, accusing them of having caused a run on the 
currency in February, 1991. 
  Also included in the legal action are the head of the State 
Intelligence (SIDE) and the head of Citibank and other foreign 
banks, for telephone eavesdropping and conspiring against the 
market to make the price of the dollar increase. 
  The nine pages of the complaint contain articles cut from 
books and magazines and newspapers including extracts of the 
book El Hacedor, a biography of Cavallo written by journalist 
Daniel Santoro which covers the run on the Central Bank 
allegedly caused by leaked information that Central Bank 
allegedly caused by leaked information that Cavallo had 
authorized then Treasury Secretary Saul Bouer to pay off 
Treasury bonds with unbacked money if necessary. 
  Bouer is alleged to have commented on this to economist 
Broda, which caused the foreign banks to buy dollars to the 
detriment of the Central Bank. 
  The legal action accuses Cavallo of having raised interest 
rates and increased statutory reserve requirements with the 
Central Bank to overcome the crisis. Monner Sans also accuses 
SIDE of finding out via wire-tapping and not reporting the 
matter to the courts. 
  Bouer is accused of having leaked a state secret and Broda 
and the banks are charged with having profited from the deed.

  [Text] (DYN-NA) -- Argentina received a $230 million 
tranche from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) yesterday. 
  The deposit was made under the terms of the Extended Payment 
Facility signed by Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo in April 
1992. 
  According to the press release from the Economy Ministry, in 
future the inspection team from the IMF will not need to visit 
this country to verify that Argentina is keeping up with its 
commitments. 
  This disbursement is the tenth in the series since the 
Convertibility Plan was introduced. 
  The guidelines for 1993 called for a primary surplus of 4.4 
billion dollars (excluding privatizations) but according to 
official figure reaching $5.1 billion.

  [Text] According to a report carried on 20 February by an 
international news agency, Cuba will strive to resume its 
diplomatic ties with Argentina during a scheduled official visit 
Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina will pay to Buenos Aires 
7-9 April. 
  The Cuban Foreign Ministry reportedly is awaiting an 
Argentine confirmation of the official visit, the first by a 
high-ranking Cuban official since Carlos Menem took office in 
1989. 
  "The response is expected to arrive either tomorrow or in 
the 
next few days," said Cuban sources. The same sources added that 
Robaina is travelling to Buenos Aires after a three-day visit to 
Montevideo, Uruguay, from 4-6 April within the framework of a 
tour through several Latin American countries. 
  However, Argentine Deputy Foreign Minister told LA PRENSA: 
"So far we have had no news on the subject. If we do, we would 
consider it because there is nothing strange in this visit." He 
said that, for example, "former Cuban Foreign Minister Malmierca 
has visited Argentina," among other "Cuban strong men" who have 
recently visited Argentina.

  [Text] Argentine Vice Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella 
stressed on 21 February that Argentina's approval of a possible 
bombardment of Serbian positions in Sarajevo by NATO forces 
served to "break" the UN "Security Council's deadlock situation." 
  In remarks to a radio station, the Argentine vice foreign 
minister announced that Argentina was the first country to take 
this stance, through a note Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella sent 
to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus- Ghali. 
  Discussing the end of the Serbian siege of the Bosnian city 
of Sarajevo, Petrella explained that the "lack of a consensus" 
on the political and strategic management of the warning 
measures among the United States, France, and Russia was the 
source of some "hesitation that has existed so far in the 
implementation of the Security Council's measures." 
  Breaking this deadlock situation was possible "in many ways" 
thanks to a proposal Argentina raised with Ghali, asking him "to 
determine, with his wisdom, how the air force element was going 
to be used." Petrella also noted that our country offered the 
International Red Cross "to take care of refugees or orphans." 
He said this offer had been "inspired by an idea raised by 
President Menem, in case it becomes necessary."

  [Text] Although the MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary 
Left] is not being investigated by the Controlled Substances 
Court, it is the main defendant in the Chavarria case. 
  The trial against Isaac Chavarria, accused of drug 
trafficking as a result of testimony by drug trafficker Meco 
Dominguez, is turning into a process against the MIR. The 
Dominguez file is a bomb that is beginning to take effect. 
  According to Meco Dominguez' testimony, Isaac Chavarria was 
a 
powerful drug trafficker protected by the MIR. The drugs and 
documents found at Chavarria's house and farms, as well as the 
testimony of half a dozen arrested drug traffickers are 
confirming the charges made by Dominguez. 
  Chavarria was an official MIR member. He obtained a MIR 
membership card in 1992 signed by Santa Cruz Prefect Rolando 
Arostegui and the MIR chief of Santa Cruz Department. 
  A Chavarria employee who is now under arrest, (Wilbert Cox 
Molina), described how Chavarria purchased and sold drugs. 
(Wilbert) states: "I also want to mention here that while my 
employer, Isaac Chavarria, whom I guarded, was hospitalized in 
the Calacoto Clinic in La Paz, he was visited on several 
occasions by Colonel Jorge Velazquez, chief of the Government 
House aides de camp; Mrs. Edith Paz Zamora; and Rosario Paz 
Zamora, who took him flowers; as well as by [MIR president] 
Oscar Eid Franco, who paid the hospital bill. He gave Edgar 
Fernandez [another Chavarria employee] about $25,000 to pay the 
hospital expenses." Oscar Eid Franco has confirmed that he paid 
the bill. 
  In this file we also find the answers to several questions. 
Meco Dominguez was arrested and taken to court when he broke his 
partnership with Chavarria and therefore with the MIR. Dominguez 
operated in the Regine discotheque, which has been closed by 
police investigations. Discotheque owner Juan Carlos Peredo Paz 
was arrested recently. Peredo Paz is a MIR member and a former 
official from the Agricultural Bank and the National Bank 
Superintendency. He has been a middleman in operations to 
launder dollars from drug trafficking activities. Peredo Paz has 
acknowledged that twice he received checks from Meco Dominguez 
for a total of $1.3 million. 
  In the third section of Meco Dominguez' case file we find a 
letter found by the Special Anti-Narcotics Force [FELCN] in 
Chavarria's house. It is signed by Edgar Fernandez Lazcano, who 
is currently at large. In this letter, Edgar Fernandez tells 
Chavarria, for whom he worked, that in November 1990 he was 
arrested by the FELCN in La Paz but was soon released from 
prison thanks to a telephone call that he, Edgar Fernandez, 
thinks was made by Susana Seleme [not further identified] from 
Government House. 
  Two pieces of evidence that unfortunately involve former 
President Jaime Paz Zamora are missing from this file. One of 
them is a video found in the house of Chavarria that FELCN did 
not want to show to either the public or the court. The FELCN 
also did not send to court the conflicting testimony between 
Meco Dominguez and Chavarria. In the testimony, Dominguez said 
in front of Chavarria that when Jaime Paz Zamora was president 
of the Republic he had lunch with Chavarria in a Santa Cruz 
restaurant. Meco Dominguez was present at the lunch but he says 
he did not hear the conversation between the two. 
  Two photographs, which already have been published in the 
newspapers, are also missing from the file. The first, which was 
first published four years ago, shows Jaime Paz Zamora and 
Chavarria together. The second picture was published on 20 
February by EL DIARIO and shows Paz Zamora, Meco Dominguez, and 
top MIR leaders together. 
  The only explanation the MIR has given to the public so far 
is that, in effect, there was a friendship between Paz Zamora 
and Chavarria. The charges made by Meco Dominguez now must be 
proven or rejected in court. Has this friendship led Paz Zamora 
to cover up the illegal activities of Isaac Chavarria?

  [Text] The following is a JATA report on the connections 
between the MIR [Movement of Revolutionary Left] leadership and 
Bolivian drug kingpins: 
  The MIR leadership held meetings with Carmelo Meco Domingez, 
Isaac Chavarria Diaz de Medina, and Jorge Roca Suarez, a.k.a. 
Techo de Paja. This is what sentenced drug trafficker Meco 
Dominguez testified before Brazilian officials on 10 November 
1993. At the time, Meco Dominguez was being sought by the 
Bolivian courts. According to the report, Meco Dominguez 
voluntarily presented himself before Brazilian police in Mato 
Grosso do Sul to provide information on his illegal activities 
in Bolivia. 
  Carmelo Meco Dominguez told the Brazilians that he, and his 
partner Chavarria, held at least 10 meetings with the MIR 
leadership to discuss issues pertaining to the financing of the 
1987 municipal elections and the 1989 general elections. 
  Dominguez told Brazilian antinarcotics police that these 
meetings were attended by the following MIR leaders: Jaime Paz 
Zamora; Oscar Eid Franco; Gaspar Encina; Rosario Paz Zamora; 
Susana Seleme; [name indistinct] Arostegui; Jorge Mendez; Isaac 
Chavarria; Jorge Roca Suarez, a.k.a. Techo de Paja; and (?Sando 
Kasp Saucedo), a.k.a. Checo. 
  Carmelo Meco Dominguez told Brazilian authorities that the 
meeting's objective was to discuss the financing of the 
elections and that he accepted this proposal in good faith 
because it was going to be good for the country. 
  Dominguez added that Paz Zamora and the aforementioned 
persons attended several meetings at Isaac Chavarria's house. 
He said: I want to note that we held about 10 meetings before 
the elections. We also held a very special meeting on 15 April 
1987 at Orlando Vaca Diez's house on Sucre Street in Santa Cruz 
to celebrate Jaime Paz Zamora's birthday. 
  This contradicts what [MIR President] Oscar Eid said on 21 
February on this program. Eid Franco said Carmelo Meco 
Dominguez was an uninvited guest, but on 10 November 1993 
Dominguez told Mato Grosso do Sul antinarcotics agents that he 
had been one of the organizers of the birthday party. Dominguez 
also said he had hired a Mexican folk band. How can anyone 
allege that Carmelo Dominguez was an uninvited guest. (?He 
appears in one of the pictures taken at the time). He had 
organized the party and hired the Jalisco Mexican band in Santa 
Cruz. This party was publicized the next day in Santa Cruz 
newspapers. 
  Dominguez added that in July 1987, Paz Zamora arrived in 
Santa Cruz to hold another special meeting and that he 
personally went to Viru-Viru airport in his blue Toyota station 
wagon to drive the MIR leader to Isaac Chavarria's house, where 
they met Jorge Roca Suarez, a.k.a. Techo de Paja.

  [Text] Minister of Government German Quiroga expressed his 
doubts about depositions made by two notorious drug traffickers 
involving former Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora in alleged 
meetings with "Thatched Roof" [drug lord Jorge Roca Suarez]. 
Quiroga said: "These depositions have been made by convicts 
linked to drug trafficking." 
  Quiroga said: "It is important not to hurt the dignity of 
citizens, especially those citizens who have occupied our 
nation's highest posts." He noted: "We must not forget the 
status of the people who made these depositions." 
  Quiroga recalled that the depositions were made by criminals 
who had been convicted by the courts of justice for being linked 
to drug-trafficking rings. 
  Quiroga nevertheless reported that the depositions, videos, 
and photographs linked to drug-trafficking crimes are part of 
the case portfolio sent to the courts of justice yesterday. 
  Minister Quiroga described the evidence as open to the 
public. He said: "It is therefore open to review by national 
public opinion." 
  Quiroga noted: "It is not fair to comment on issues that may 
have been brought up without carrying out an assessment, a 
review, and a complete investigation into these depositions." 
  In response to questions posed by journalists accredited to 
Government Palace, Quiroga pointed out: "There are serious 
contradictions between the depositions of the two drug 
traffickers." He noted: "The courts will make the actual 
assessment and conduct the appropriate investigations."

  [Text] National Social Defense Secretary Mario Soliz 
yesterday warned that the government of President Gonzalo 
Sanchez de Lozada has undertaken an all-out offensive against 
drug trafficking by increasing antidrug operations in Chapare, 
by seizing substances that are considered precursors, and by 
eliminating all excessive or "illegal" coca farms in that area. 
Soliz said: "We want to make it clear that we are not 
fomenting a clash with peasants, but we will not hesitate to 
enforce the law." 
  He said that under the terms of Law 1008, legal coca farms 
destined for traditional consumption can cover an area of only 
12,000 hectares in the Yungas of La Paz. He reiterated that 
35,200 hectares must be eliminated in the next few years, 
regardless of whether peasants agree or disagree with this. 
"Illegal coca plantations are concentrated in Chapare. There 
are people who went to that area for the sole purpose of growing 
illegal coca plantations and causing problems for the 
government. We have reports that those people cut down many 
trees to prevent the government from enforcing the law," Soliz 
said. 
<H5>  Pits and Coca </H5>
  He explained that recent antidrug operations in Chapare have 
disclosed that coca has been planted for the exclusive purpose 
of producing cocaine. Maceration pits, which are the first 
stage for preparation of the drug, were detected a few meters 
from the plantations. 
  After showing to reporters several pictures of presumably 
new 
plantations, Soliz said that this type of activity cannot and 
must not be tolerated, for the sake of the country's image and 
of the commitments that Bolivian authorities have assumed with 
foreign governments. 
  He reported that in this regard, his secretariat has ordered 
the immediate destruction of illegal farms, adding that -- in 
his opinion -- this position is endorsed by the peasants who 
want to engage in the alternative development programs and plans. 
  He said that under the terms of the law, almost seven 
hectares were eradicated in the past two days, and that this 
task will continue in the following days. 
<H5>  Eradication </H5>
  Asked about fulfillment of the target of eradicating 5,000 
hectares of coca farms, which has been agreed upon with the U.S. 
Government, Soliz admitted that this target will hardly be 
fulfilled. "We doubt that the total number of agreed upon 
hectares will be eradicated, but the government will make all 
efforts to comply with its international commitment beyond 31 
March, which was the previously established deadline," he said. 
  Bilateral agreements are annually signed with the U.S. 
Government. The Bolivian side has to eradicate a specific 
number of "illegal" hectares in return for U.S. Government 
promises to provide economic aid to Bolivia for its balance of 
payments. 
  During fiscal year 1994, which is about to end in the United 
States, an agreement was reached providing for the eradication 
of 5,000 hectares in return for $40 million. This target, 
however, will not be fulfilled. 
  Fewer than 3,000 hectares of illegal farms have so far been 
eradicated. Meanwhile, disbursement of a third $10 million 
installment remains uncertain. Asked about the subject, Soliz 
said that the fourth installment will not be received because of 
the nonfulfillment of the target. 
<H5>  Less Money, More Hectares </H5>
  According to the explanation given by Soliz, for the 1995 
U.S. fiscal year -- which has just begun -- Bolivia will have to 
promise to eradicate a larger area of illegal coca farms. "When 
the next agreement is signed, the idea is to eradicate the 
largest possible area of `illegal' farms which do no good to the 
country," Soliz said. 
  However, he declined to refer to an increase in U.S. 
economic aid, which for the past two years has dropped 
considerably from $66 million in fiscal year 1993 to almost $40 
million in fiscal year 1994. If this downward trend continues, 
Bolivian obligations will grow as U.S. aid drops, Chapare coca 
growers' leaders have said.

  [Text] The second meeting of PECA -- Cuban-American 
Professionals and Entrepreneurs -- ended today. The businessmen 
had been meeting in Havana since Monday. PECA's final 
communique stressed the need for the U.S. Government to lift the 
blockade against Cuba. 
  In a communique released to the press at the end of the 
meeting and read by PECA Coordinator Roberto Solis, it was 
reported that during the past three days the entrepreneurs 
continued to explore investment possibilities in Cuba that will 
be possible when the blockade comes to an end. The document 
added that the conference scheduled by the Cuban Government for 
April must contribute to normalizing relations between the 
country and Cuban emigrees, which for more than three decades 
have been negligible and intermittent. 
  The Cuban-American professionals and entrepreneurs praised 
the fraternal and respectful atmosphere that prevailed during 
all of their discussions -- discussions in which specific 
proposals were made. 
  Upon closing the seminar, Sergio Corrieri, the president of 
ICAP -- the Cuban Friendship with the Peoples Institute -- 
stressed that although there were differences of opinion, all 
statements by the Cuban-American professionals and entrepreneurs 
will be analyzed because they were made within a framework of 
understanding that must exist between Cubans here and those 
Cubans in the United States who have adopted a constructive 
attitude toward the Cuban revolutionary process.

<F P=106> [Article by Salete Silva] </F>
  [Text] Brazilian exporters are preparing to compete with 
Mexican producers, who will benefit from NAFTA -- the trade 
agreement among the United States, Mexico, and Canada. The 
agreement will be implemented in March and Brazilian 
entrepreneurs say problems will probably begin to get serious 
within three or four years. The entrepreneurs explained that 
the Mexicans will have to streamline their industries and 
improve their competitiveness in various areas. Nearly one 
fifth of Brazilian exports are sent to the United States. 
  Spare-part manufacturers are studying possible associations 
with Mexican companies. Textile industries are investing in new 
technology. Orange juice and shoe producers are seeking new 
markets in other areas, among them the EC and Mercosur [Common 
Market of the South]. 
  Claudio Vaz -- the president of the Vehicles Spare-Parts and 
Components Industry Union, Sindipecas -- said Brazilian 
companies may lose more than their markets, they might also lose 
investments if U.S. head offices spend the funds assigned for 
their Brazilian branches in Mexico. 
  For this reason Vaz wants to close some industrial 
cooperation agreements with Mexican companies before March, as 
it was done in Argentina. Of the total exports of spare parts 
producers, 38 percent -- or $871 million worth -- go to the 
United States, the largest importer of Brazilian spare parts. 
Mexico, meanwhile, takes 11 percent, or $250 million worth. 
Vaz anticipates the industry will export at least 10 percent 
more this year, and total sales are estimated to reach $2.5 
billion. 
  According to news that leaked out last week, the Mangels 
company, a wheel manufacturer, is planning to invest nearly $15 
million in the purchase of a U.S. company. Directors of the 
company believe the deal is the best way to increase its 
competitiveness when NAFTA starts operating. 
  Orange juice exporters believe NAFTA is just one more reason 
for companies to seek new markets. Orange juice producers 
export nearly 30 percent of their total output to the United 
States. At the beginning of the 1980's, orange juice exports to 
the United States represented 50 percent of the industry total 
output but for some time now producers have increased their 
sales to European countries. 
  Orange juice entrepreneurs believe the United States will 
always be an important Brazilian orange juice client. One 
Brazilian exporter said orange plantations in Mexico are not 
well developed and their processing methods need to improve. He 
added that the quality of the Brazilian product has been tested 
and approved by the U.S. market. 
  Another factor favoring Brazil is low production cost. 
Brazil spends a lot less on labor, irrigation, and drainage. A 
box of orange costs nearly $1 in Brazil. In the United States 
the same box costs at least $2.20. 
  Sebastiao Burbulhan, president,of the Sao Paulo State Shoe 
Industry Union, has said that shoe exporters will also invest 
more in new markets, such as the Mercosur market. The largest 
share of their exports -- 69.3 percent of the $2 billion 
exported annually -- go to the United States. Burbulhan said 
the industry is most concerned about U.S. threats of sanctions 
due to the problem of patents. "Sales enquiries are less 
frequent," Burbulhan said. 
  The textile industry is also preparing to face competition 
from Mexican products. Luis Americo Medeiros, president of the 
Sao Paulo State Textile Industry Union, has said that last year 
companies invested $600 million in importing machinery and 
equipment.

<F P=106> [Report by David Romero Murillo] </F>
  [Text] San Pedro Sula -- Representatives of the assembly 
plant industry suspect that the U.S. Embassy is behind the 
organization of unions within the industrial parks. 
  Robert Larios Silva, president of "San Miguel" industrial 
park indicated that he had received information "from the mouths 
of union leaders themselves, that U.S. Ambassador in Honduras 
(William Pryce) has been supporting these movements and that he 
is sympathetic toward them because of his prior participation in 
union movements in the United States." 
  In addition, Larios Silva charged that the AFL-CIO movement 
is also interfering since it has paid for advertisement in the 
newspapers in order to express its support for the unions that 
are organizing within the assembly plant industry. 
  In evaluating the latest management-worker conflicts that 
are 
taking place within the industrial parks, Larios Silva said they 
have not been able yet to pinpoint the real origins of the 
problems. He indicated that by claiming ill-treatment by Korean 
firms' foremen and supervisors, workers have resorted to certain 
type of actions that have started to undermine other firms that 
are not facing similar types of problems. 
  The industrial park president emphasized that the protest 
activities organized by workers which has weakened the assembly 
plant industry as well as the rest of the country are a result 
of poor legal and administrative advice the Koreans have been 
receiving. He added that within the union federations there are 
also leaders who are taking advantage of the opportunity to 
improve their image. 
  Larios Silva pointed out that every day it becomes more 
difficult to convince foreign investors that unions are 
positive, especially when these same unions decide to take over 
factories and highways which causes serious repercussions to 
investors. "Assembly plants work under international contracts 
and compete against similar companies located in several 
countries. If they do not meet requirements, contracts are 
simply terminated and other companies that will honor contracts 
are sought," Larios Silva stated. 
  The industrial park president is asking President Carlos 
Roberto Reina's administration and unions federations if they 
have a solution in hand for when the foreign assembly plants 
decide to withdraw from Honduras and resolve to eliminate 42,000 
jobs and the country ceases to receive $350 million in revenues? 
  He indicated that there is much concern within the assembly 
plant industry. Currently, domestic investment in the 
industrial park totals 1 billion lempiras in infrastructure and 
buildings. 
  Finally, he called for a moment of reflection taking into 
account the difficult situation Honduras is experiencing at this 
time.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 23 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Today, 
approximately 40 state employees occupied the Guatemalan 
National Palace while hundreds have surrounded the Government 
House to demand a 40 percent salary increase. The move to occupy 
to palace, headed by Armando Sanchez, secretary general of the 
National Federation of State Workers Unions of Guatemala 
[FENASTEG], is part of several pressure measures being carried 
out by the workers, who initiated a 72-hour strike today. 
  Sanchez warned that unless President Ramiro de Leon Carpio 
holds an "urgent" meeting with the workers, they will not leave 
the Presidential Palace. The workers at the palace are shouting: 
"We are not leaving." The presidential guard has been increased 
in and around the palace but so far there has been no 
altercations.

  [Editorial Report] During four campaign stops in Cali, 
Liberal Party presidential hopeful Ernesto Samper said that, if 
elected, he will "pay the debt owed to Colombian women." 
Speaking to various female audiences ranging from professionals 
to factory workers, Samper said he would adopt a policy of 
"positive discrimination" in favor of women whereby a woman 
would be given preference over a man in situations where equally 
qualified male and female candidates are being considered for a 
job or promotion. Samper's seven-point program to benefit women 
would include: Formulation of a National Development Plan to 
promote greater opportunities and equality for women; measures 
to reduce unemployment among women, especially those between 
25-35 years of age; a promise that, by the end of his term, 
women would occupy half of the managerial and advisory positions 
in his government; flexibility in work schedules to accommodate 
the needs of working mothers; better training for child-care 
providers to improve their wage status; more severe punishment 
for violence against women; and subsidies to help female heads 
of households. 
  During one address to a group of factory workers, most of 
whom were single mothers, Samper also said his administration 
would provide 500,000 subsidized housing units and implement a 
program of microenterprises for female heads of households.

  [Text] Uruguay will have a much more flexible agreement 
with the IMF regarding the goals of its 1994 economic program, 
which does not require the approval of the IMF executive board. 
  Of the possible agreements between the IMF and the different 
countries, the government decided to quit the "enhanced 
surveillance" [two preceding words in English] agreement which 
follows the "stand by" [two preceding words in English] on 
strictness regarding IMF loans and a quarterly control of the 
established goals. "Enhanced monitoring" [two preceding words 
in English] will be conducted instead. 
  Official sources told BUSQUEDA that the new agreement will 
be 
established in March. 
  The "staff" [preceding word in English] of experts headed by 
Western Hemisphere Director Steri Beza will study details of the 
program submitted by Uruguay with the adjustments made last 
week. For 1994 there is a predicted inflation rate of 35 
percent, a fiscal deficit of 0.5 percent of the GDP, a 
devaluation of 2 percent per month, and a salary increase of 32 
percent for public employees "consistent" with the devaluation 
percentage. 
  It was stated that the choice of a more slack agreement with 
eventual measures for the correction of incorrect fiscal 
spending this year "leave doubts among IMF experts about their 
real fulfillment." 
  The approval of the IMF executive board (which is reserved 
for the "stand by") is not required for "enhanced surveillance" 
but it supposes explicit acceptance by the IMF of the country's 
economic program. 
  It was explained that "enhanced monitoring" also has 
quarterly goals but it allows "greater margins for deviation 
from them," and the IMF controls are more "global."

<F P=106> [Interview with Surinamese Development Aid Minister Assen by </F>
Linda Otter in Paramaribo; date not given: "`If We Do Nothing 
Now, We Will Lose All Our Credibility'"-- first 10 paragraphs 
are DE VOLKSKRANT introduction] 
  [Text] Paramaribo -- "There is strong resistance to the 
International Monetary Fund [IMF] in Suriname," says Suriname 
Development Aid Minister Assen. As a result his country does 
not intend to deal with the IMF, as the Netherlands demanded. 
However, Suriname will have to implement whatever hard-hitting 
restructuring measures the IMF may require, he conceded. 
  "Last year, many Surinamers still thought that they were 
doing the Netherlands a favor implementing a restructuring 
program. They did not understand that they were doing so out of 
pure necessity." Surinamese Development Aid Minister R. Assen 
rapped his knuckles sharply on the table to underline his words. 
  Assen, who back in September took over from his predecessor, 
ex-minister E. Sedoc, who retired for health reasons, believes 
that Suriname must get down to work straight away. "We must not 
wait until money starts to arrive from the Netherlands, but 
simply make a start." 
  The relationship between the Netherlands and Suriname cooled 
considerably when the Netherlands stopped making payments (worth 
200 million -- DE VOLKSKRANT editor's note) out of a slush fund 
aimed at stimulating production. Such money would only be made 
available if Suriname, which had fallen a considerable way 
behind in implementing its structural adjustment program [SAP], 
turned to the IMF. 
  This demand aroused a great deal of emotion. According to 
the government, doing business with the IMF was tantamount to 
committing political suicide. However, things would now appear 
to have settled down again somewhat, following a compromise 
proposal drawn up by Assen which was delivered to the 
Netherlands Government in The Hague last week by members of the 
Surinamese Parliament. Suriname stated its readiness to turn to 
the Warwick Research Institute to monitor its SAP. The 
Netherlands could then turn to the IMF for advice concerning its 
findings. 
  Although members of the Netherlands Parliament found the 
plan 
"rather laborious," Development Aid Minister Pronk did not react 
dismissively. Assen admits that the compromise does not in any 
way affect the way in which Suriname will have to implement its 
adjustment program. Both the Warwick Research Institute and the 
IMF are making strong demands regarding Surinamese restructuring. 
  According to Assen: "It is a highly sensitive issue. In 
Suriname there is strong resistance to the International 
Monetary Fund, partly because of the poor image that it had one 
year ago. For example, wild tales were circulating about actions 
in the streets of Jamaica, where an adjustment program was also 
being implemented. 
  "The first party to turn feeling against the IMF was the NDP 
[National Democratic Party] (the opposition party led by ex-Army 
chief Bouterse -- DE VOLKSKRANT editor's note), back in 1988. 
When the IMF was in the news again last year, the members of 
the government were extremely cautious. Primarily because the 
trade unions were also strongly opposed to the IMF. It would 
have taken me years to convince them that the IMF had 
significantly changed their tack in the meantime, and become 
more lenient. We cannot tolerate a situation such as this. 
After all, we have just emerged from a period of military rule, 
during which the government exercised insufficient control over 
the army. Furthermore, the army gained hold within a political 
party (the NDP -- DE VOLKSKRANT editor's note) which seemed 
pretty likely to come to power." 
  "However, we have already overcome one important obstacle. 
In October, the trade unions announced actions due to the fuel 
shortage and the tremendous increase in electricity prices. 
When Bouterse decided to go along with them, betting that the 
government would fall before Christmas, it suddenly became dead 
quiet. If Bouterse had kept his mouth shut, then the government 
might indeed not have lasted until Christmas." 
  Assen already has the dates of the restructuring measures 
in his head. On 1 June, Suriname, which currently practices 
four different exchange rates, will make the transition to 
having just one uniform rate. In addition, import duties will 
have to be raised at around the same time, and the plan for 
restructuring the civil service will also have to be ready. "We 
will have to implement specific, coherent measures," said Assen, 
"which means that the working population will have to accept a 
wage adjustment." 
  [Otter] It is not the first time that the government has 
announced hard measures. 
  [Assen] I think that today the government is certainly 
convinced that there is no way around implementing a structural 
adjustment program. If we do nothing now, we will lose all our 
credibility. By 1 June we must have a uniform exchange rate. 
The bottom line for me is that the Surinamese economy must be 
restructured, with or without foreign help. Naturally, 
receiving help would considerably facilitate the task of keeping 
the rate under control, but I am not counting on receiving that 
money before June. I think that The Hague is saying: "Let us 
wait and see how serious you are about implementing your plan." 
  [Otter] In Suriname, there was a strong emotional reaction 
when the production slush fund worth 200 million was frozen. 
How important is that money? 
  [Assen] The balance of payment support makes it easier for 
us 
to keep the rate under control. And with the industrial fund we 
could stimulate exports. We must increase the state's foreign 
exchange revenue. Surinamese companies are primarily trading 
and packaging companies. The entrepreneurs will have to become 
more export-oriented. That is difficult because trading yields 
a great deal. The mentality of our entrepreneurs must change. 
If the purchasing power of the people declines further, then 
that will probably happen of its own accord. At the same time, 
we must all attend to replacing imports. Suriname must give 
priority to production that makes the country self-sufficient. 
  [Otter] Until now, the government had refused to implement 
the restructuring measures, being mindful of a possible popular 
uprising. 
  [Assen] If we offset the measures by others that raise 
people's incomes, then I think there will be less resistance 
than anticipated. Perhaps we will leave salaries as they are 
and work with a system of bonuses. That will not trickle down 
to secondary provisions (social security, etc. -- DE VOLKSKRANT 
editor's note). If the government's plans are to be 
restructured, then the officials must be accommodated within the 
private sector. Then we will have to extend our social safety 
net, e.g. by raising officials' pensions. 
  [Otter] Why did the government not act any earlier if it is 
all that simple? 
  [Assen] It is not simple. Last year we needed to devote our 
energy to dealing with the question of power. In the meantime, 
attitudes have changed somewhat. There are now many more 
Surinamese who understand why the SAP is necessary. For a long 
time, Suriname was isolated, due to its period under military 
dictatorship and the freezing of development aid. There were 
only a few people who had heard of an adjustment program, and we 
needed time to find our feet. 
  I can still remember speeches by ministers which contained a 
great deal of rubbish about the SAP. Now we understand that the 
SAP is not being forced on us from abroad. So in that respect 
we have become a little wiser.

  [Text] The government and El Chacal [Jose Angel Talavera] 
will hold a decisive meeting on Thursday in Caulatu. The 
preparations for the high-level meeting, which will determine 
the disarmament of El Chacal, were made yesterday afternoon by 
Sergio Caramagna, mediator and coordinator of CIAV-OAS 
[International Commission of Support and Verification-OAS] and 
Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta. 
  The meeting with El Chacal is scheduled to be held at noon 
today [as heard] at Caulatu, the same place where the rearmed 
group last year kidnapped two Sandinist deputies and several 
government officials. Yesterday, the Army withdrew all of its 
troops from the area to facilitate the meeting. 
  In addition to Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta, who 
leads the government delegation, the other people who will 
attend the meeting are Colonel Javier Carrion, on behalf of the 
EPS [Sandinist People's Army], while the Catholic Church has 
appointed Dr. Winston Betanco. 
  Government sources reported the government delegation is 
fully empowered to solve the conflict with the rearmed men from 
the 3-80 Northern Front.

  [Text] Brasilia -- A day after asserting that he would no 
longer negotiate the approval of the FSE [Social Emergency Fund] 
with Congress, Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso agreed 
not to include the funds for salaries in the education field 
(amounting to $250 million this year) in the FSE. The agreement 
to leave part of the education funds that would have been held 
under the FSE with the Education Ministry was reached yesterday 
during a luncheon with the leaders of six political parties 
(PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], PFL [Liberal Front 
Party], PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], PP [Popular 
Party], PTB [Brazilian Labor Party], and PL [Liberal Party]), 
and the coordinator of the constitutional revision, Nelson Jobim 
(PMDB-Rio Grande do Sul). 
  The agreement responds especially to the PMDB bloc, which 
assumed as its own the proposal by Education Minister Murilio 
Hingel, who was one of the first to protest the cuts to his 
budget. The governors were also interested in the negotiation 
because the money for salaries in the education field is 
distributed to the states, favoring the poorest ones. 
  This is not a defeat for the government, because the FSE 
still withholds $1 billion of the revenues which, according to 
the Constitution, should be earmarked for education. The 
government also promised that public housing this year will have 
the $500 million provided for in the budget.

  [Text] Brasilia -- An agreement between Finance Minister 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso and the Liberal Front Party [PFL] 
leadership has given new life to the constitutional revision. 
To ensure PFL support for his plan -- the Social Emergency Fund 
[FSE] will be voted on today -- Fernando Henrique Cardoso 
committed himself to stimulating government participation in the 
revision, including voting on changes in the economic order. 
The minister asserted that he supports the end of monopolies in 
the field of telecommunications and oil. The PFL defends these 
points as being fundamental for the revision. 
  Cardoso yesterday received for breakfast PFL President Jorge 
Bornhausen and PFL leaders in the Senate Marco Maciel 
(Pernambuco) and Luis Eduardo (Bahia). The minister's first 
gesture in favor of the revision was to ask rapporteur-general 
Nelson Jobim (Brazilian Democratic Movement Party -- Rio Grande 
do Sul) to move forward the date for reporting his comments on 
the amendments and proposals related to the economic order. 
  Bornhausen said: This is a political gesture by the 
minister. He is thus stimulating debate about the issues that we 
deem fundamental for the revision. 
  The agreement with the PFL will make it possible to vote on 
postponement of the constitutional revision to 31 May -- as the 
PFL wants -- during today's session of the Constituent Congress, 
which has been convened to vote on the FSE. According to 
Cardoso's agreement with the PFL leaders, postponement of the 
deadline for the end of the revision work will be voted on 
first, as a guarantee of the government's commitment to the 
constitutional revision. 
  According to Senator Marco Maciel, the agreement does not 
mean that the government will support the changes proposed by 
the PFL: 
  "There are changes in the economic order that are of 
interest 
for the development of the plan, but the leaders of the party 
and of the allied bloc in Congress will be responsible for their 
approval."

  [Text] Panama City, 23 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- Panamanian 
President Guillermo Endara traveled today to the Colombian City 
of Medellin to sign a free trade agreement with Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria. Before leaving on a private flight, the 
Panamanian president said: "I am going to harvest what we and 
President Gaviria have been cultivating for more than a year." 
Endara referred to Gaviria as "the godfather of democracy" in 
Panama. 
  Foreign Minister Raul Mulino and more than 60 businessmen 
are 
travelling with President Endara to participate in the fourth 
meeting of the Neighborhood Commission created by the two 
nations to promote the integration of their economies and to 
resolve border conflict. 
  Presidents Endara and Gaviria will sign an agreement that 
will permit the free trade of sixty items and the implementation 
of a sea line between Cartagena de Indias and Colon. The 
agreement will be implemented after a year of negotiations by 
the Neighborhood Commission. The two states are committed to 
keeping this agreement from hurting national production. For 
this reason, the initial list (of more than 200 items) was 
greatly reduced, an official of the Panamanian Foreign Trade 
Institute who worked in the drafting of the list has reported. 
  In Medellin, Endara and Gaviria will also sign an agreement 
on the special status of people without legal documents. This 
agreement will allow the status of one country's nationals who 
live in the other country and who are able to prove that they 
have resided there continuously for more than two consecutive 
years to be legalized. 
  The presidents will review the Neighborhood Commissions' 
work 
on security and border matters, the repatriation of arrested 
people, deportation procedures, and issues related to the social 
development of the two nations. 
  Panama and Colombia initiated rapprochement in March 1991, 
when Gaviria visited Panama for the first time. This 
rapprochement led to the creation of the Neighborhood 
Commission, whose work began in 1992. July 1993 in the Colombian 
city of Cartagena de Indias, Panama and Colombia signed a letter 
of understanding to encourage business cooperation and to 
increase trade relations to more than $300 million annually.

<F P=106> [Article by Beatriz V. Goyoaga] </F>
  [Text] According to Lower House Foreign Relations Committee 
chairman Florencio Acenolaza, the existence of oil around the 
Malvinas has not been proven and if any were to be found, the 
amount would be so small and the difficulties of exploitation so 
extraordinary that it would not be commercially viable. 
  The existence of oil in the Malvinas has been a source of 
conflict between Argentina and Britain. The UK (as published by 
the Herald) recently announced a major oil industry impact study 
but the Argentine deputy denounces the existence of oil as "a 
lie and a political maneuver to manipulate Argentina when 
discussing fisheries or sovereignty. This (manipulation) is not 
only encouraged by the Foreign Office but also by people in this 
country who wish to change current Argentine policy." 
  Acenolaza believes that the existing oil basins are all 
under 
Argentine territorial jurisdiction and exploitation conditions 
are the most difficult in the world -- so difficult that oil 
prices would be as high as $50 per barrel when world prices are 
under 15. 
  "The existence of oil is an invention of British authorities 
as a strategy to gain a better position when discussing 
fisheries or sovereignty. It is untrue and a blatant lie that 
there is oil in the Malvinas. The UK is manipulating 
information aimed at confusing public opinion over the real 
possibility of finding oil in the islands." 
  Deputy Acenolaza, himself a geologist, underlines that 
former 
state oil company YPF had prospected in the Malvinas and the 
existence of oil could not be proven. On this subject, YPF 
spokesman Juan Carlos Ferrari declined comment, explaining that 
the company "does not have or give any information regarding oil 
in the Malvinas." He also added that in 1933 a member of the 
Foreign Office had said that there was no oil in Saudi Arabia. 
  "Geologists know that geological conditions to certify the 
existence of oil-fields in the Malvinas do not exist. Both 
islands are made of Paleozoic rock, which lack the natural raw 
material to generate hydrocarbons. The stratographic base, made 
of crystalline rocks, has a natural incapacity to hold 
hydrocarbons. It is equally impossible with the quartz or sandy 
rocks which make up the greater part of the territory." 
  The deputy also underlined that in the South Atlantic and 
the 
British exclusion zone there are two oil basins dating back to 
Jurassic times, which correspond to the geological formation of 
the Patagonian oil basins. 
  He recognizes the existence of three oil basins with 
insignificant amounts of oil. The "Cuenca de Malvinas" basin to 
the southwest of the islands was surveyed by a concession which 
discovered oil and gas only in two wells (Ciclon XI and Salmon 
XII) but in such small quantities that it did not justify 
exploitation. The geological information of the "Banco Burwood" 
basin to the Northwest is reportedly so limited that no 
guarantee for the existence of hydrocarbons can be given. In 
the third basin -- "Cuenca de San Julian" -- the sedimentary 
depths hardly reach 2,500 meters and the existence of 
"generating rocks" for oil has not been proven. 
  According to the deputy, the barometric and weather 
conditions of the three basins together with the low price of 
oil make the possibilities of finding oil in the Malvinas 
irrelevant.

  [Excerpt] After President Gonzalo Sanchez de Losada 
received an invitation from Chilean President-elect Eduardo Frei 
to attend his presidential inauguration in March, the opposition 
and government coalition on 9 February agreed that it is not 
correct for Sanchez de Losada to accept the invitation because 
the two countries do not maintain diplomatic relations, although 
the government coalition congressmen were more cautious in their 
comments. 
  Beyond the difference of approach toward the maritime 
vindication subject, the chiefs of Condepa [Conscience of the 
Fatherland], Carlos Palenque; the ADN [Nationalist Democratic 
Action], Jorge Landivar; and MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary 
Left], Hugo Carvajal, maintained that Chile has caused Bolivia's 
isolation from the sea and has historically denied it any 
possibility to a sovereign outlet to the Pacific Ocean. 
  According to Foreign Ministry sources consulted by an 
international news agency, Sanchez de Losada is studying the 
possibility of attending the presidential inauguration in Chile 
on 11 March. On that day, Chilean President Patricio Aylwin will 
pass the presidency to Eduardo Frei, who won the last general 
elections. 
  LA RAZON learned last night that the national government has 
practically rejected the possibility that President Gonzalo 
Sanchez de Losada will attend the ceremony, although the reason 
for not doing so was not explained. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Alfredo Vega] </F>
  [Text] The priority objective of the trip by Defense 
Minister Oscar Camilion to Brazil this weekend is aimed at 
mending some aspects of bilateral relations. 
  Based on that interpretation by the officials close to the 
minister, the entire mechanism surrounding the imminent visit is 
oriented in that direction. But when questions are asked, the 
officials only respond with gestures that are supposed to be 
eloquent. 
  Camilion will be in Brasilia on 21 February to start a 
series 
of meetings with top military officials, and he also will visit 
Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The invitation last December came, 
strangely, from the Brazilian Foreign Ministry and not from any 
of the three military ministries since there is no defense 
ministry in Brazil. 
  Several issues will be discussed. 
  The two countries' policy began to go in different 
directions 
at some point. It could have been when Argentina gave up its 
missile project or when it became the only Latin American 
country that sent troops to the Persian Gulf. Washington is far 
away but it is known that its look goes far. 
  Some ideas about Argentine desires to join NAFTA, which in 
Brasilia is an organization considered as a competitor of 
Mercosur [Common Market of the South], also could have had an 
influence. 
  For some analysts the main site of friction is not Buenos 
Aires or Brasilia but the United Nations. Argentina worked hard 
to get a seat on the Security Council that took office on 1 
January for the next two years. 
  Brazil is also a temporary member and ends its term this 
year. 
  If a decision is made in the United Nations to increase the 
permanent council members, Argentina will support Germany and 
Japan over the desires Brazil may have in this regard. 
  Brazilian military officers have emphasized the 
Argentine-U.S. military exercises held last September in 
Misiones Province close to the Brazilian border in their 
reports. The exercises are not new. There were other joint 
exercises but this time the Brazilians seem to be more sensible. 
  To prevent future irritation, our country will propose a 
reciprocal information mechanism establishing that when either 
of the two countries will hold military exercises in border 
regions with third countries, notification will be made several 
months in advance. 
  Camilion plans to carry out a work of high diplomacy as in 
his best years as foreign minister and ambassador to Brazil. 
According to his aides, that background was evaluated by the 
Brazilian Foreign Ministry at the time of making the invitation.

  [Excerpt] A poll by Javier Otaegui &amp; Associates revealed 
that nearly 80 percent of Buenos Aires Radical Party members 
disapprove of the Olivos pact. 
  Meanwhile, the spokesman for the Alfonsin movement, Simon 
Lazara, remarked yesterday that a meeting between the chairman 
of the UCR national committee, Raul Alfonsin, and the senator 
and Radical leader in the capital, Fernando de la Rua, "would be 
good" for resolving the conflict among the capital's UCR 
internal factions. 
  The poll, taken last Friday, showed that 78.9 percent of the 
citizens affiliated with the UCR reject the agreement between 
the PJ [Justicialist Party] and the UCR favoring amendment of 
the Constitution. On the other hand, 21.1 percent support it. 
  Otaegui's survey consists of a sampling of 790 telephone 
calls selected on the basis of social strata and districts. 
  The poll may possibly prove to be an encouraging precedent 
for De la Rua, a staunch opponent of the pact, whose supporters 
in the district promoted a referendum on that subject. 
<H5>  Doors Open for Dialogue </H5>
  Lazara explained that no talks have yet been held regarding 
the possibility of an Alfonsin-De la Rua summmit. The spokesman 
stressed: "The doors are always open for a dialogue between the 
two leaders." 
  The presumption of a possible conclave began to be discussed 
after De la Rua met with the Alfonsinist critic, Jesus Rodriguez 
(of the Centennial Studies Center). That meeting came to an 
abrupt end, when the possibilities of no confrontation in the 
district were exhausted. 
  Meanwhile, next Thursday, the various metropolitan UCR 
forces 
will decide at the district committee meeting whether or not to 
hold the referendum on the Olivos pact favoring constitutional 
amendment jointly with the internal elections to determine the 
Buenos Aires convention slates. The De la Rua faction has a wide 
majority on the board of directors, but the question lies in 
whether it will obtain the two thirds majority required to 
impose its will. 
  The De la Rua deputy, Jorge Enrique Benedetti, told LA 
NACION 
yesterday: "It would be best if the Centennial group abstained 
from voting against the referendum next Thursday, and, as a 
democratic gesture, let the affiliate decide, as stipulated in 
Articles 112 and 114 of the party's organic charter." 
  Deputy Federico Storani (UCR-Buenos Aires), in statements 
made to the Cordoba newspaper LA VOZ DEL INTERIOR, lashed out 
severely against his main internal adversary, expressing the 
view that, "If the Radical Party fails in the 10 April 
elections, Raul Alfonsin will pay the political price." [passage

<F P=106> [Article by Facundo Landivar: "Shared Slates: In Politics </F>
Two Plus Two Is Not Always Four"] 
  [Text] Two plus two is seldom four, except in mathematics. 
And this sum is relevant in pre-constituent Argentina, in view 
of the kind of arrangement that has appeared during recent weeks 
in the country's political arena: the formation of shared slates 
between the Radical and Justicialist Parties for the Constituent 
Assembly. 
  A recent poll taken by the Javier Otaegui &amp; Associates 
law 
office in the Federal Capital has again shed doubt on that 
mathematical axiom. It shows results indicating that the 
country's two leading parties are very far removed from 
automatically pooling their votes if they should run on a shared 
slate. 
  The poll (in which 1,181 persons were queried by phone) was 
taken last Tuesday in two parts. In the first, those polled 
responded concerning their voting intentions in the 10 April 
elections if the Radical Party and the PJ appear with separate 
slates. 
  Based on that hypothesis, 20.9 percent claimed that they 
would vote for the UCR; 19.4 percent for the PJ (the two parties 
add up to 40.3 percent); 8.5 percent for the Great Front; 7.3 
percent for the Socialists; and 2.9 percent for Modin. A total 
of 21.4 percent claimed that they would not vote for any party, 
and 16.4 percent appeared undecided. 
<H5>  Everything Changes </H5>
  Nevertheless, the situation changed substantially when they 
were asked about voting intentions in the event that the PJ and 
UCR formed an alliance: virtually the rest of the opposition 
spectrum, basically, the Great Front and Modin, doubled their 
votes. On the other hand, the two majority parties "only" 
totaled 28.6 percent. 
  Result? PJ-UCR Alliance: 28.6 percent; Great Front: 15.5 
percent; and Modin: 6.4 percent. 
  Conclusion: Although two plus two is 40.3 percent, if the 
term "shared slate" is added to the equation, the result is 
appreciably smaller. According to the poll, this is a reality in 
the Federal Capital that could spread to other jurisdictions in 
which the bipartisan system is not predominant either. 
  And, although the law office that took the poll might be 
considered unreliable by some, particularly after its 
well-remembered blunder in the elections held on 3 October of 
last year in Buenos Aires Province, its conclusion is the same 
as that of prominent PJ sources, such as Eduardo Duhalde. 
  Last week, the Buenos Aires governor was sufficiently clear 
about precluding the possibility that a shared slate could be 
formed in his district: "The only thing that it will do is 
foster the chances of third political forces." 
<H5>  Others Opposed </H5>
  With the same forcefulness as Duhalde's, but opting for an 
"off the record" comment, a top-ranking member of the Menemist 
team assured LA NACION that such pacts "are absurd." He 
predicted: "You'll see the parties at the extremes gain 
considerably in votes if that notion succeeds." 
  Added to the list of "nonbelievers" in the virtues of the 
alliance is the minister of economy, Domingo Cavallo, who, in an 
article published today (see third section), claims that, if 
there were no shared slate, he would have agreed to be a 
candidate for the Constituent Assembly in Cordoba. 
  Of course, the results possibly accrued from such an 
agreement depend on each district: Where the bipartisan system 
is a constant, the possibility of a flight of votes to third 
forces is far slighter, as the analysts agree. 
  Cordoba, Catamarca, Rio Negro, and Corrientes are some of 
the 
districts in which there is talk of a PJ-UCR alliance. If such 
an arrangement should materialize, it is also certain to make a 
substantial change in the political game that has predominated 
in Argentina thus far. However, it no longer depends on 
mathematics.

  [Text] As has been reflected in a poll recently devised by 
the Studies Center for the New Majority, during the past eight 
years the trade unions appear as the principal victims of the 
political violence in our country. 
  The same survey shows that the trade unions are followed by 
the news media and the Armed Forces as the preferred targets of 
those attacks. 
<H5>  The Fluctuations in Violence </H5>
  Within the aforementioned period, political violence 
increased significantly throughout the second part of 
ex-President Raul Alfonsin's administration, and declined 
appreciably in 1990, during the term of President Carlos Menem. 
It rose the following year, and declined again in both 1992 and 
1993. 
  Based on the type of act whereby the aggression 
materialized, 
out of a total of 2,033 cases, 1,100 (43 percent) involved 
physical attacks; 551 (22 percent), threats; 327 (23 percent), 
bombs exploding; 306 (12 percent), shootings; 129 (5 percent), 
bombs set that failed to explode; and 67 (3 percent), attacks of 
an incendiary type. The remaining 26 (1 percent) belong in the 
"others" category, since they cannot be ranked in the 
aforementioned categories. 
  During 1993, there was an obvious heightening of 
sociopolitical violence in the months preceding the elections 
(July, August, and September). A significant decline occurred in 
the final quarter, during which only the incidents that occurred 
last December in Santiago del Estero Province demonstrated a 
rise in that type of violence. 
<H5>  Violence, Not Terrorism </H5>
  The poll clearly indicates that the political violence in 
Argentina has occurred on a level of harassment and 
intimidation. It has not reached the level of terrorist acts, as 
has happened in other Latin Latin American countries, such as 
Peru and Colombia, or in Spain and Great Britain, on the 
European continent. 
  From a geographical standpoint, it attests to the fact that 
the Federal Capital and Buenos Aires Province account for over 
80 percent of this type of incident. 
  Demographic concentration, added to the conglomerate of news 
media in that area, help to explain this phenomenon.

  [Text] An opinion poll taken by the Union Studies Center 
for the New Majority in the Federal Capital during the month of 
December in the past four years shows that the image of the 
Executive Branch has improved appreciably. On the other hand, 
that of the Legislative Branch has remained stable, and that of 
the Judicial Branch has suffered a considerable downgrading. 
  The positive image of the Executive Branch showed the 
following changes: in 1990, it was 34.4 percent; a year later, 
it was 48.5 percent; and, in December 1992, it was 35.9 percent. 
  Last December, however, it evinced a more than considerable 
rise, reaching 48.3 percent. According to New Majority, this is 
explained by the government party's victory in the 3 October 
elections and the approval of the law on constitutional 
amendment. 
  As for the Legislative Branch, its positive image was 
reflected in the following numbers from December 1990 to 
December 1993: 15.3 percent, 14.2 percent, 15.3 percent, and 
12.3 percent. Although its figures varied little from one year 
to the next, this branch shows the lowest index of the three 
branches of government. 
  Insofar as the Judicial Branch is concerned, it showed very 
slight changes of opinion among the persons queried between 1990 
and 1992. The really sudden shift occurred last year, when it 
had recorded an unexpected support just a few months earlier. 
This branch had a positive image of 20.9 percent in 1990, 24 
percent in 1991, 18.8 percent in 1992, and only 13.1 percent in 
December of last year. 
  This marked setback can be explained by the deepseated 
crisis 
experienced by the Supreme Court. 
  The conclusions are as follows: 

  -  In December 1990, the Executive Branch had a better image 
than the Legislative and Judicial Branches; however, the latter 
surpassed the Congress. Now, the Judicial and Legislative 
Branches have similar indexes. 
  -  Whereas the Executive Branch 
improved appreciably during the past four years, both the 
Legislative and Judicial Branches declined during the same 
period. 
  -  Although in most countries it is common for the Congress 
to have a lower level of support than the Executive Branch, it 
is unusual for the Judicial Branch to have an image that is so 
much more negative. 

    Using the same data collection device, the image of various 
power factors was analyzed. 
  At the end of 1993, the Catholic Church and the FFAA [Armed 
Forces] have an image better than that of business owners and 
trade unions: a trend that has been repeated during the past 
seven years. 
  During this period, however, the image of the different 
factors evolved differently. The Catholic Church, which six 
years ago had no more than 36 percent positive opinions, has now 
attained 47.8 percent; while the FFAA, which had 24.6 percent at 
the end of 1987, have now reached 36.3 percent. 
  On the other hand, business owners, who gleaned 18.4 percent 
positive opinions in 1987, now have 20.1 percent; whereas trade 
unions, which had 18.6 percent six years ago, have now garnered 
no more than 6.9 percent, with a negative trend. 
<H5>  Technical Record </H5>
  The poll was taken by sampling opinion on the State's three 
branches of government. It included the population residing in 
the Federal Capital and in Greater Buenos Aires that met the 
voting requirements. The sample size included 1,000 individuals, 
and the poll was taken during the month of December in 1990, 
1991, 1992, and 1993.

  [Text] Brasilia -- Political leaders and representatives 
from the three branches of government have decided to ignore the 
incident resulting from President Itamar Franco's public affair 
with model Lilian Ramos and cool the reactions. Top-ranking 
members of the Excutive, Legislative, and Judicial Branches have 
decided that a pact of silence is the best solution. Despite 
this, jurists and legislators believe that the president's 
behavior during the Carnival parade at dawn on 13 February at 
the Sambodromo [Carnival parade ground in Rio de Janeiro] could 
be tried under the Impeachment Law (Law 1079) if there is 
political willingness to do so. 
  A clear example of this cautiousness is how Deputy Nelson 
Jobim (PMDB-RS) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Rio Grande 
do Sul], the rapporteur of the constitutional revision, reacted. 
On 14 February, when the newspapers published the pictures of 
Itamar Franco and the model, Jobim avoided commenting: "I have 
nothing to say about Carnival, I have to mind the constitutional 
revision." In private meetings, Jobim, Deputy Sigmaringa Seixas 
(PSDB-DF) [Brazilian Social Democracy Party-Federal District] 
and Senator Jarbas Passarinho (PPR-PA) [Progressive Renewal 
Party-Para] said that this is no time to apply the law to the 
letter. The group is supported by the STF [Federal Supreme 
Court] members, and cabinet members such as Industry and 
Commerce Minister Elcio Alvares. 
  Jobim, Sigmarigna, Passarinho and Alvares are certain that 
if 
a destabilizing atmosphere is created, Franco will be unable to 
avoid impeachment for having violated Clause 7 of Article 9 of 
the law. This clause establishes that "behavior in a manner 
incompatible with the dignity, distinction, and decency of the 
post" constitutes a crime against probity in administration." 
Passarinho declined to comment on the issue by stating: "I 
will not comment on this, not because I am restricted from doing 
so but because my comments would be harmful to the country." 
  Minister Elcio Alvares, who played an active role in the CPI 
[Congressional Investigating Committee], which impeached former 
President Fernando Collor, has also declined to pass any legal 
judgment on the issue. He said: "During the CPI, I was a 
senator of the nation, but today I am a member of President 
Franco's cabinet." Although he admits that the incident, which 
he personally witnessed at the Sambodromo, was not "irrelevant", 
he warned: "We need to minimize the incident in order to have 
some tranquility at the economic level. There is a good saying 
for all this: `Blame it on Carnival.'" Asked whether the 
institution of the presidency of the Republic, may just get 
carried away by the rhythms of Carnival, Alvares said: "Please 
spare me, because I do not want to be disloyal to President 
Franco." 
  In a note to the press, the Brazilian Shoes Exporters 
Association [Associacao Brasileira dos Exportadores de Calcados] 
(Abaex) has demanded President Itamar Franco tender his 
resignation within 48 hours, "for lack of decorum." Otherwise 
"for the sake of the dignity of the fatherland", Abaex will 
submit an impeachment request to the STF. According to Abaex, 
Itamar Franco's gesture "debases the nation by ridiculing it 
before international public opinion."

  [Text] Brasilia -- President Itamar Franco feels the 
Brazilian democratic process is still "fragile" and, in his 
annual written message to Congress at the opening of the 
legislative term, warned that state and society "are at imminent 
risk if we do not begin a fairer distribution of wealth." Franco 
guaranteed that "the government will not hesitate in using the 
instruments it is entitled to use by law to guarantee compliance 
with constitutional obligations," and he said: "Democracy must 
be tolerant with the expression of ideas but it cannot remain 
inactive in the face of deliberate disorderly actions." 
  Itamar Franco began his message -- a rendering of accounts 
of 
his government's action -- speaking about corruption. "The past 
12 months served as a painful examination of our political 
customs and the ethical behavior of a considerable part of the 
business elites," he said. He did not, however, delve deeper 
into the subject. "I excuse myself, on account of the natural 
pressures of the post I hold, from commenting on the behavior of 
those involved." 
  The president of the Republic then referred to the 
constitutional revision and said: "States and municipalities 
must have greater political and administrative 
responsibilities." He then made mention of the deterioration of 
the [word indistinct] state and of some sectors of society" [no 
opening quotation mark as published] as the result of inflation. 
"The currency reflects the moral standard of society and the 
strength of the states," Franco wrote, before asking congressmen 
to support the economic stabilization measures: "The executive 
branch counts on your patriotism so that it will not lack the 
legal instruments needed to implement the measures that are 
being and will be adopted in the next few months." Franco ruled 
out any possibility of an economic shock that, he said, "would 
only help discredit the state and further erode our currency." 
  When mentioning the restructuring of the state by the 
Constituent Congress, President Itamar Franco's tone became 
graver. He said that through the years "corporate groups ensured 
a privileged position for themselves," and he warned: "Without 
intending to intervene in the other government branches 
(legislative and judicial), it is my duty to warn them of the 
imminent danger the state and society run if we are unable to 
begin a fairer distribution of wealth." Franco then gave some 
figures that, according to him, "cause us shame and scare us," 
like the loss of 50 percent of Brazilian workers' purchasing 
power in the past 30 years.

<F P=106> [Interview with Brazilian President Itamar Franco by Marcia </F>
Carmo; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Carmo] Would you support Minister Fernando 
Henrique's candidacy for the presidency? 
  [Franco] The government does not have a candidate. If he 
were chosen as a candidate he would be an excellent choice and 
would enjoy the government's support. This is wishful thinking 
because in December he and other ministers sent me a letter 
saying he would not run for elections. I prefer to leave things 
as they stand. 
  [Carmo] But is he a candidate? 
  [Franco] Only he can answer that question. 
  [Carmo] Do you think he will leave his post with a 
40-percent 
inflation rate? 
  [Franco] Only he can also answer that question. 
  [Carmo] Would Fernando Henrique's exit from the government 
mean the end of the economic plan? 
  [Franco] The economic plan does not belong to Fernando, it 
belongs to the government. 
  [Carmo] Why do you think he would be a good candidate? 
  [Franco] He would be an excellent candidate -- one must 
stress -- if he were a candidate. He is intelligent, astute, a 
good politician, a patriot who took on a collapsed economy and a 
bankrupt state. 
  [Carmo] Is Antonio Britto Fernando Henrique's ticket mate? 
  [Franco] An excellent ticket. Britto is an excellent 
candidate. The government still does not have any preference. 
  [Carmo] Are you in favor of extending the resignation 
deadline for those who hold public posts and want to run for 
election? 
  [Franco] I do not have an opinion on this matter. 
  [Carmo] Will we see better days after Carnival? 
  [Franco] We hope so; we hope Congress will immediately 
approve the economic plan and the budget. 
  [Carmo] Pedro Simon, the government leader in the Senate, 
blamed your advisers for letting model Lilian Ramos onto your 
balcony. 
  [Franco] Does Pedro Simon understand what Carnival is all 
about? 
  [Carmo] Have you read the newspapers yet? 
  [Franco] No. But I have received many photographs. 
  [Carmo] Do you feel you have debased the dignity of your 
post 
by being photographed with a woman wearing nothing but a T-shirt? 
  [Franco] It is my duty, as president of the Republic, to 
greet and talk to everyone. 
  [Carmo] You are being strongly criticized because of the 
photograph. Does this not worry you? 
  [Franco] I did nothing hedonistic. I have more serious and 
grave things concerning the country to concern me. 
  [Carmo] Bahia State Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes even 
commented that in other times you would have been ousted. 
  [Franco] For falling in love? I would like to see him as a 
presidential candidate and hope he never gets involved in a 
similar episode. He has criticized the government a lot. In my 
opinion, one who criticizes so much is a suitable candidate not 
to the Senate but rather for the presidency of the Republic. 
The governor meets all the requirements to be the candidate for 
his party. 
  [Carmo] Why? 
  [Franco] He would solve all the Brazilian problems in no 
time 
if he were president. He should start campaigning publicly, not 
for the Senate but for the presidency. 
  [Carmo] Did you know she was wearing only a T-shirt? 
  [Franco] Nobody told me. How was I to know? I couldn't ask 
her that sort of question. I couldn't ask if her knickers were 
read, black, yellow, pink. 
  [Carmo] If you had known? 
  [Franco] What could I have done? Lend her a pair? I did not 
have a spare pair with me. 
  [Carmo] Were you upset by the fact that she let journalists 
listen into a conversation you held? 
  [Franco] No. She is a lovely woman. 
  [Carmo] Are you madly in love? 
  [Franco] You only fall madly in love once in your life. 
  [Carmo] But do you think this could have been a second time? 
  [Franco] I don't know. I am not saying so; it could have 
been the case. There may even be a second time. You are 
talking too much about my private life. Leave the girl alone. 
  [Carmo] Had you met her before? 
  [Franco] I knew her as an actress and model. 
  [Carmo] But she is not known for this. 
  [Franco] [does not answer] 
  [Carmo] Is Lilian Ramos the reason for your good mood? 
  [Franco] The street spirit does one good. The simplicity of 
the people, their good wishes, relaxed attitude, and warmth. I 
too felt all that in Rio. 
  [Carmo] During the past few days you have granted several 
interviews and appeared in public quite often. Is this a new 
strategy? 
  [Franco] The media does not understand that the president 
respects those who surround him. The media has created an image 
of isolation and solitude. You are unfair to me. I have not 
changed at all. 
  [Carmo] With the inflation rate. 
  [Franco] We did not invent inflation, misery. The people are 
suffering. Do you think we invented that problem? Quite the 
contrary, we established that 32 million people are living in 
absolute poverty. 
  [Carmo] Do you think salaries should be adjusted according 
to 
the highest URV (Real Value Unit) of the past 12 months? 
  [Franco] I am not going to answer that because it concerns 
the finance minister and his team. 
  [Carmo] Will those public servants who were dismissed by 
Collor's administration be reinstated? 
  [Franco] I will study this and the filling of ministry 
vacancies over the next few days in Juiz de Fora. 
  [Carmo] When will you announce the names of the new mines 
and 
energy and communications ministers? 
  [Franco] I will meet on 27 February with PMDB [Brazilian 
Democratic Movement Party] President Luiz Henrique to make this 
decision. I want a technician in the Communications Ministry, 
so Djalma Moraes may remain in that post. 
  [Carmo] Why did you say that you too chanted the slogan that 
inflation must drop? 
  [Franco] The president is also a victim of inflation, 
misery, 
poverty. The simplest citizen can see this. Why would I want a 
40 percent inflation rate? Moreover, I will tell Fernando that 
the inflation dragon has just paraded along the avenue. The 
media believes it is easy to curb inflation but the people 
understand; they know it is not an easy job. I did not invent 
inflation and hunger during the past two years. 
  [Carmo] What about Carnival, was it good? 
  [Franco] Carnival in Rio was wonderful. It is a popular 
festivity, the opportunity for the Brazilian people to regain 
their self-esteem. 
  [Carmo] Do you believe a president should celebrate Carnival 
at the Sambodromo [Carnival parade ground in Rio de Janeiro]? 
  [Franco] I do. I am a president who went to the Sambodromo 
to watch the Carnival celebrations with great joy. 
  [Carmo] You have earned yourself a name for having an affair 
on the avenue. 
  [Franco] I did not have an affair. 
  [Carmo] Did you flirt? 
  [Franco] No. 
  [Carmo] If Lilian asked you to get involved with her, would 
you accept? 
  [Franco] Let her ask me. I do not discuss one woman with 
another woman. 
  [Carmo] Did you feel the photographs invaded your privacy? 
  [Franco] I always feel my privacy is being invaded. 
  [Carmo] Do you think you will only be able to find a 
girlfriend after your mandate is over? 
  [Franco] Stop that. Please, my private life is my own.

  [Text] Brasilia -- Finance Minister Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso on 18 February assured business people that the 
government will not require that privately set prices be 
converted from real cruzeiros to the URV [Real Value Unit]. "Our 
system, which is one of free market prices, does not include 
compulsory mechanisms. The government is not thinking of 
controlling market prices," the minister said, rather irritated 
and nervous. The government strategy regarding oligopolies, 
according to the minister, will be to talk with them in order to 
identify factors explaining all excessive price increases. 
  Cardoso said the government decision to call on research 
institutes to help formulate the URV variation index has the 
purpose "of making clear to society that the URV is not an 
indicator used to manipulate results. We still have not lowered 
the hammer on this, but the government wants to ask these 
institutes to help us." According to the minister, FIPE 
[Economic Research Institute Foundation] President Juarez 
Rizzieri said the institute might have difficulties calculating 
the daily inflation rate, but it is willing to cooperate with 
the government. 
  Cardoso believes the definition of the criteria to update 
the 
URV "is a delicate matter" that must be decided "calmly and with 
patience." Regarding the minimum salary, Cardoso said the way to 
increase the minimum salary's real purchasing power -- as the 
president wants -- is by increasing companies' productivity and 
stabilizing the price of food and other consumer goods. "Without 
those elements, everything will be just fantasy. We do not want 
to create another illusion," Cardoso said. The minister admitted 
the possibility of discussing the conversion of the URV with 
economic interest group representatives. "We can, but we have 
not talked about it," the minister said. 
  Cardoso said state companies also will cooperate with the 
economic plan. "We are making a major effort to stabilize the 
economy. It is necessary for people to wait for a few month in 
order to achieve what we want afterward," Cardoso said.

  [Text] Last year, after three years of recession, the 
country's GDP reached the highest level in history. The accrued 
total of goods and services produced by the country during that 
year reached $446 billion, indicating a growth of 4.96 percent 
compared to 1992. The expansion represents a real growth of 
23.54 percent compared to the GDP of 1980, which closed the 
expansionist cycle registered throughout the 1970's. During the 
same period, however, the population increased 28.2 percent, 
which means that per capita income fell 3.7 percent despite the 
improvement of 2.97 percent registered last year compared with 
1992. The growth of the 1993 GDP, compared with 1992, was 
attributed to the recovery of the mean real productivity index, 
which grew nearly 10 percent, the stability of employment 
levels, and a 9-percent increase in industrial production.

  [Text] Brasilia -- The formula devised by the economic team 
to adapt the tax system to the new leading reference index, the 
Real Value Unit (URV), contemplates that during the first stage, 
taxes will continue to be indexed to the Ufir [Reference Fiscal 
Unit]. Nevertheless, a parity will be established between the 
Ufir and the URV so that when the URV is instituted as currency, 
the Ufir may be equal to a certain fraction of the new currency. 
There would thus be a rate of exchange between the Ufir and the 
URV in the same way as there is a dollar exchange rate. The 
proposal to let the Ufir continue along with the URV seeks to 
head off legal actions. During the stage in which the URV will 
only be a reference index, the Ufir will continue to be 
effective with its present structure. However, once the URV is 
instituted as currency, the Ufir will disappear. 
  The contention of Central Bank Foreign Area Director Gustavo 
Franco is that this transition system to index taxes will do 
away with all the legal impediments that prevented the adoption 
of the URV for tax purposes. The great stumbling block 
presented by the Federal Revenue Service was a provision 
established in the National Tax Code stipulating that taxes 
should be indexed to the past inflation, which ended up by being 
incorporated into jurisprudence by the Federal Supreme Court 
[STF]. According to the definition cited in the text of the 
economic program, the URV would reflect the current inflation 
and would not be used for indexation purposes. 
  Suggestion -- Special Adviser Edmar Bacha went as far as 
suggesting that indexing taxes to the URV should be optional. 
Taxpayers could then choose to index their taxes to the Ufir, 
the value of which would continue changing, or to the URV, the 
value of which would be adjusted but to a lesser degree. 
  The Federal Revenue Service questioned the use of the URV 
for 
tax purposes because it feared that a disaster similar to the 
one that took place in 1991 would supervene. At that time the 
government was defeated time and again at the STF due to the 
obduracy of the team of former Minister Zelia [Cardoso de Mello, 
economy minister under Fernando Collor] to use the TR [Reference 
Interest Rate] as reference index.

  [Text] Brasilia -- The government intends to review the 
structure and functions of the National Monetary Council (CMN), 
the financial system's main regulatory body. Nearly everything 
ranging from the closure of banks to intervention in financial 
consortiums, including state loans with federal guarantees is 
decided by the CMN. Central Bank [BC] President Pedro Malan said 
the economic team believes the CMN has suffered hypertrophy, and 
it wants to simplify it by transforming it into a forum for 
debates and the creator of norms and the main guidelines for the 
monetary policy and the financial system. 
  The changes in the CMN should take place together with the 
process of the BC's independence, once a new special director is 
appointed so he can guide discussions about the reform in 
Congress. The CMN is made up of government and private sector 
representatives. 
<H5>  Defense of the Currency </H5>
  The council's composition will not be changed. Private 
sector 
representatives will continue to participate but the CMN's 
priority will be to defend the currency by supervising the 
monetary policy and controlling the monetary base's expansion. 
  The CMN is also one of the organizations that judges 
transgressions in the financial system. Bank directors, for 
example, can resort to the CMN to protest a prohibition 
determined by the BC. The judgment processes are slow and the 
sanctions, when they are issued, come with years of delay. The 
BC is considering making the CMN speedier. The CMN would, 
therefore, lose its jurisdiction over such matters. Control of 
the banks will remain a responsibility of a more independent BC. 
  The economic team's objective is to mark the independence of 
the monetary authority when the monetary standard changes in 
Brazil. The strong currency defended by Finance Minister 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso implies an autonomous body to defend 
its strength. Malan hopes that the new BC directors with a fixed 
mandate will be defined by the end of the current administration.

  [Text] Sao Paulo -- The government policy to improve the 
price of green coffee beans in the international market through 
the retention of 20 percent of the harvest has worsened the 
coffee producers' crisis, according to Americo Sato, president 
of the Brazilian Coffee Industry Association [Associacao 
Brasileira da Industria do Cafe -- Abic]. Sato says that the 
auctions carried out by the government with the objective of 
increasing coffee quotations abroad also increased prices in the 
domestic market. Sato said that the average annual quotations in 
dollars of green coffee beans suffered a variation of 34.56 
percent in 1993 in comparison with 1992, or 28.8 percent above 
the IGP-M [Market Prices General Index] of the same period. The 
average price adjustment in dollars during 1993 was 31.69 
percent. This difference, Sato said, caused a monthly loss of 
$8.5 million for the coffee industry. 
  In 1993 coffee production increased only 1.4 percent in 
comparison with the previous year while the initial forecast was 
a 4.6 percent increase. The sales volume during the second half 
of the year remained 2.5 percent below the average sales for the 
period. "The sharp increase in the price of coffee, which is 
responsible for 45 percent of the costs of the industry, has 
prompted a coffee price increase above the inflation which, 
together with the loss of the purchasing power, caused an 
immediate reduction of consumption," Sato said. 
  Consumption -- According to Abic, total consumption of 
roasted and ground coffee in the domestic market during 1993 was 
not greater than 9.3 million bags, which is equivalent to an 
annual consumption of 2.9 kg per capita. The Abic had expected a 
consumption of 9.5 million bags or 3 kg per capita. "Many coffee 
companies have already stopped their activities. Unless the 
government establishes a partnership with the coffee industry, 
with some mechanisms to regulate the price of the raw material, 
the crisis in the coffee industry will become worse during the 
present year," Sato said.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Brazil monitored through 17 
February. 
  Collection of the IPMF, provisional tax on financial 
operations, during its first month was $336.1 million (about 
131.3 billion cruzeiros), which is below the estimated $400 
million per month. (Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in 
Portuguese 8 Feb 94 Business and Finance Section p 3) 
  The Brazilian Petroleum Corporation, Petrobras, showed a 
$666 
million net profit in 1993, an increase of 1,089 percent 
compared with 1992. The government's debt with the company 
dropped $366 million. The total debt now amounts to $3.358 
billion. (Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 10 Feb 
94 Business and Finance Section p 5) 
  The Planning Secretariat reported that at least 40 of the 
108 
state-owned companies, including Petrobras, in 1993 surpassed 
the budget limitations set for them by Congress. Expenses 
surpassed the investment ceiling by 13.9 percent. (Rio de 
Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 10 Feb 94 Business and 
Finance Section p 4) 
  The government is spending $1.2 billion per year to maintain 
15 unfinished hydroelectric and thermoelectric plants. A study 
by the Andersen Consulting firm shows that each 1,000 megawatts 
of unfinished plant costs $100 million. Besides this, $12.3 
billion already has been invested in these plants. The Angra-2 
nuclear plant's expenses alone already have hit $2.6 billion.

<F P=106> [Article by Dora Kramer] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia -- The Lilian Ramos episode and President 
Itamar Franco's remarks supporting Minister Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso's presidential candidacy have provoked a reaction inside 
the government, whose members decided to launch an offensive 
with two clear objectives that will be implemented at different 
times: The immediate goal will be to play all the government 
cards in an effort to get the economic plan approved and later, 
in the next stage, announce impact measures to show the public 
that there is a government and that government members speak a 
single language. 
  One of the measures proposed by some government officials, 
but still not digested by the economic team, would be to convene 
a meeting of economic interest group representatives to discuss 
the implementation of the URV [Real Value Unit]. The issue will 
be discussed with Minister Cardoso early next week, but one of 
the ministers supporting the proposal thinks the moment is 
excellent "to convene entrepreneurs and workers for a debate and 
avoid negative reactions against any unpopular decision" such as 
the adjustment of salaries by an average indicator, for instance. 
<H5>  Repercussions </H5>
  Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Federal 
Administration Minister Romildo Canhim, Industry and Commerce 
Minister Elcio Alvares, Labor Minister Walter Barelli, and Civil 
Household Chief Henrique Hargreaves began articulating the first 
lines of an action plan to guarantee governability and maintain 
the government's credibility until the election. One of the 
ministers confided that the negative repercussions [of the 
latest incidents involving the president] were big and 
unexpected and the government understood it needed to act 
swiftly. 
  The key rule on 18 February was act to united until the 
economic plan is approved. There were quiet meetings and 
conversations all day. Canhim met Cardoso. Alvares and Barelli 
talked personally more than once, and even Hargreaves, who was 
being treated for a back problem, participated through the 
telephone. All the ministers agreed that Franco's remarks during 
an interview were an attempt to take the Lilian case out of the 
headlines, although some of them also admitted that the tactic 
used was not a very good one. That was the reason behind the 
joint effort to help the finance minister. 
  The news that spread around Brasilia saying the finance 
minister traveled to Juiz de Fora on the night of 17 February to 
meet the president was not confirmed, but not a single minister 
denied the meeting had actually occurred, either. One of them 
only said that the minister had travelled, while another only 
admitted knowing about Cardoso's temporary "disappearance," 
although accepting that no plan can be implemented without the 
president's previous consent. 
<H5>  `Tricked' </H5>
  The first step is the immediate entry of all ministers in 
the 
battle for votes, to convince congressmen that the Lilian case 
"is an incident lost on the horizon," and that the launching of 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso's candidacy has not really occurred. 
The agreed-upon version will be that in both cases the president 
was "tricked." At Carnival, by the model, and at the news 
conference, by reporters, who did not understand what he really 
meant. Besides, in the past couple of days important 
congressional leaders, such as Senator Jarbas Passarinho and 
Marco Maciel, were contacted with the purpose of creating an 
environment favorable to the government, in the sense that there 
is no way now to explain to the country a negative position on a 
proposal that was approved when it was voted on in general terms.

  [Text] Sao Paulo -- The PT [Workers Party] executive board 
will meet today to discuss the first draft of the party's 
platform without having been able to reach a consensus on 
controversial proposals such as the issue of a moratorium and 
the Armed Forces. President and candidate Luis Inacio Lula da 
Silva yesterday appealed for an understanding: "We can only 
promise what we can implement," Lula said. Besides taking the 
debate on the program to the PT grassroots, Lula wants to extend 
the discussion to include forces from outside the party. The 
purpose is to get rid of the ideological character of the 
discussion and be able to elaborate a program on goals. In the 
next few months he intends to intervene more often in the debate 
on the platform, even if it is only to avoid what he calls 
"political exploration of the project with a text that is not 
definitive." 
  Lula spent the day yesterday meeting with some of the people 
who cooperated in formulating the program such as sociologists 
Francisco Weffort and Maria Victoria Benevides, economist Jorge 
Matoso, Vice President Rui Falcao, and Secretary General 
Gilberto Carvalho. He wanted to know the status of the program 
and which are the points of disagreement. According to Lula, 
"we are not interested in avoiding controversial items." 
  Moratorium -- The dissemination of the first draft of the 
program where the PT defends a moratorium on the foreign debt 
did not please Lula. He has been defending a political 
renegotiation of the debt in more than 60 meetings with 
entrepreneurs. "The foreign debt must be transformed into a 
political issue and discussed by governments face to face, not 
between ministers and IMF experts," Lula said. According to him, 
the draft should not talk about default. "We do not know how the 
country will be in 1995. This is why there is no reason to speak 
about moratorium." 
  Despite the incisive defense of a renegotiation, the issue 
of 
a moratorium is one of the points on which there is no 
agreement. Two proposals should be included in the first 
official draft of the program: The suspension of payments to 
give way to an audit and a renegotiation with creditors 
guaranteeing the payment of the commercial debt; and a 
renegotiation of the debt without excluding the possibility of 
not paying what is not considered legitimate debt. 
  Armed Forces -- The treatment that the Armed Forces will 
receive, if the PT wins the election, is also controversial. The 
draft will include two proposals. The first proposal will defend 
the Armed Forces modernization; the second proposal -- supported 
by pacifists -- proposes changes in the concept of the Armed 
Forces organization and opposes investments to modernize it 
because they are of the opinion that the natural trend points to 
its disappearance. The only point of agreement is the creation 
of a Defense Ministry. Lula supports better treatment for the 
Armed Forces but he also thinks that the matter is not a central 
issue and should be discussed after talking with military 
commanders. 
  Another matter that is still a subject of controversy is 
whether the party platform will stipulate limits to the agrarian 
reform program. Another subject of discussions is the stability 
of public servants. PT Secretary General Gilberto Carvalho 
yesterday denied that there is disagreement on the issue of 
privatizations revision. He said the program proposes an audit 
to identify corrupt officials and to see if there were 
under-evaluations of privatized public companies. "We will try 
to find ways to punish corrupt officials and compensate the 
state for damages," Carvalho said. The PT is opposed to the 
privatization of strategic companies, such as those in the areas 
of energy, oil, and telecommunications. 
  During today's meeting between the party National Executive 
Board and members of the party bloc in Congress at the Comodoro 
Hotel, Lula and party leaders will also define the participation 
of the federal congressional bloc in the constitutional revision 
process. There is a widely supported proposal to liberate PT 
legislators to participate in the revision of the most important 
issues.

  [Text] Brasilia -- The PT [Workers Party] bloc yesterday 
unanimously decided to disclose the internal crisis this party 
is experiencing. In a harsh note approved by all those 
legislators who were present, the PT bloc voiced its 
disagreement with the decision of the party leadership to ban 
their participation in the constitutional revision, and held the 
PT executive board responsible for any problems the PT's absence 
may cause for the social and individual rights attained by the 
National Constituent Assembly. PT leader Jose Fortunatti 
asserted: "If the executive board has banned us from voting, it 
has to assume the responsibility for this." 
  According to Fortunatti, the entire federal bloc was upset 
by 
the executive board's prohibition, regarded as an inappropriate 
and authoritarian interference. Fortunatti commented: "So far, 
most of the bloc has maintained a cautious attitude." 
Fortunatti noted, however, that the unrest was obvious. From 
the cautious attitude -- many remain silent during a crisis -- 
the bloc decided to make public its disagreement with the party 
leadership. Fortunatti added: "The bloc unanimously rejects 
the executive board's decision to not participate in the 
constitutional revision." 
  Senator Eduardo Suplicy sees no other alternative for the 
party leadership than to yield to the pressure being excerted by 
the PT bloc.

  [Text] The Venezuelan National Guard crossed into 
Brazilian territory in Roraima and arrested 32 miners working 
illegally in the Ianomami Indian reserve. 
  The majority of the miners were arrested on the 
Brazilian-Colombian border, near the Army battalion in Cucui. 
  Jose Altino Machado, director of the Legal Amazon Region 
Miners Union Association, said: The Brazilian miners were 
illegally arrested and taken to Puerto Ayacucho [Venezuela]. 
  The undefined markers on the Brazilian-Venezuelan border, 
manifested in the massacre of 16 Ianomami Indians in the Haximu 
area in August 1993, facilitated the invasion of Brazilian 
territory. 
  Jose Altino Machado said: The Venezuelan National Guard 
arrests the miners to steal their gold. 
  The miners were arrested last week and held in Puerto 
Ayacucho, located 400 km from the border, until 16 February.

  [Text] Havana, 20 Feb (PL) -- President Fidel Castro has 
met with two Chilean legislators of the ruling Christian 
Democratic Party who are currently on a working visit to Cuba, 
the weekly Sunday newspaper JUVENTUD REBELDE reported today. 
  The report said that the Chilean legislators who met with 
Castro were Senator Carmen Frei and Deputy Eugenio Ortega. 
  The report added that aspects concerning bilateral relations 
were reviewed during the meeting, confirming advancements made 
in common interest areas. 
  Cuba and Chile broke diplomatic relations on 11 September 
1973 when constitutional president Salvador Allende was 
overthrown in a bloody coup d'etat headed by General Augusto 
Pinochet. 
  Relations between the two nations are currently at a 
consular 
level.

<F P=106> [Report by Rolando Jaime] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 18 Feb (PL) -- Today, a high-ranking PRC 
official said ties between the PRC and Cuba are excellent. These 
ties were boosted during the 1993 Havana summit between PRC 
President Jiang Zemin and Cuban President Fidel Castro. 
  During an almost two-hour interview with PRENSA LATINA, Wu 
Jianmin, head of the Information Department of the Foreign 
Ministry, spontaneously broached the topic of bilateral ties and 
expressed his opinion of Jiang's November visit to the Caribbean 
island. 
  "I was a member of the delegation that accompanied President 
Jiang Zemin on his Latin American tour," Wu said, and stressed 
that the visit to Havana and the talks between the two 
presidents played a very favorable role for the development of 
ties between the two nations. 
  "Cuba was the first Latin American country to establish 
diplomatic relations with China and that is something we will 
never forget," Wu said. 
  The Foreign Ministry spokesman added it is very important 
for 
Beijing to promote ties with Latin America because Latin 
American countries are developing countries and relations with 
them are based on equality. 
  My personal experience of the trip to Cuba and Brazil is 
that 
the talks were held within a friendly environment. The talks 
were smooth and among equals, Wu added. 
  "That," Wu said, "is very important and it encourages mutual 
relations because all barriers are eliminated through 
understanding." 
  The head of the Information Department of the Foreign 
Ministry assessed the state of economic ties between China and 
the subcontinent, and recalled that the overall volume of trade 
in 1993 was greater than $3.7 billion, 20 percent more than in 
1992. 
  I see enormous potential in the development of our ties, Wu 
said, and added "there is only one obstacle: a lack of knowledge 
of each other's possibilities." 
  In Brazil, Wu said, I could tell they did not have this 
information, and it is essential that we solve this problem so 
we can take advantage of the opportunities and combine our 
thriving economic development with the rich resources of that 
nation. 
  The spokesman insisted there is a great outlook for 
cooperation between the PRC and the South American giant, and 
noted that "the same applies with Cuba, a country of 120,000 
square km and 11 million inhabitants with very good natural 
conditions for economic growth. 
  "A strong and vigorous cooperation force exists between 
China 
and Cuba," Wu said. 
  I believe the first step toward cooperation is getting to 
know each other, learning about our respective situations, and 
seizing the opportunity for joint development.

  [Text] Havana, 18 Feb (PL) -- The delegation of French 
parliamentarians completed its official visit to Cuba today and 
expressed its support for an increase in commercial ties between 
France and Cuba. 
  Andre Santini, chairman of the Production and Exchange 
Commission of the French National Assembly, spoke on behalf of 
the mission representing various French legislative groups and 
commented on the his pleasant interview with Cuban President 
Fidel Castro. 
  It was interesting for us to meet with one of the most 
important figures in contemporary history, and we will always 
cherish this moment, said Santini, who is also a former 
minister. He described as pleasant and very cordial the 
conversation he held with the president who, he explained, was 
very interested in the French legislature and in exchanging 
viewpoints on the most important current world events. 
  During their stay in Cuba, the legislators also met with 
Vice 
President Carlos Lage, Ricardo Alarcon, president of the 
People's Government National Assembly, and the ministers of 
foreign relations, education, and public health, among other 
officials. 
  Santini said they have seen a country that resists in spite 
of the prevailing difficult conditions and that is ready to 
accept change without giving up its political ideology. He 
noted that the delegation will present a report to the National 
Assembly and the French prime minister calling for an increase 
in the current line of credit of $120 million that Paris has 
available to Cuba, recognizing that there are good possibilities 
for foreign investments in Cuba. 
  Some international media say Cuba will fail and that the 
people here are starving to death, but we have not seen anything 
like that during our visit, Santini emphasized. 
  The French parliamentary delegation will return to its 
country tomorrow, Saturday, after completing its final 
activities in Cuba.

  [Excerpt] Havana, 23 Feb (PL) -- Before leaving for 
Venezuela, the last part of his trip to Latin America, Canary 
Islands President Manuel Hermoso Rojas signed a letter of intent 
to promote commercial development with Cuba. 
  Jose Ramon Fernandez, Council of Ministers vice president, 
signed the document on Cuba's behalf. Fernandez called the 
agreement mutually beneficial due to the activities planned to 
promote and exchange goods. 
  Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina and the delegation 
accompanying Hermoso during his six-day official visit to Cuba 
were present for the ceremony at the Foreign Ministry. 
  Prior to signing, the officials chatted. Hermoso reaffirmed 
an invitation for Robaina to visit the Canary Islands in the 
near future, as part of his scheduled tour to Spain. 
  During a news conference, the president of the autonomous 
community of Spain said the letter of intent is the completion 
of talks held during his stay on the island. During that time, 
Hermoso met with Cuban President Fidel Castro on two occasions. 
  Hermoso said he would meet with President-elect [title as 
received] Rafael Caldera during his visit to Venezuela and will 
sign several agreements with banking institutions, Fedecamaras 
[Venezuelan Federation of Associations and Chambers of Commerce 
and Industry], and with the cultural sector. 
  Strong historic ties hold us close to Venezuela as well, he 
said. He said President Caldera himself is of Canary descent 
and, during a recent visit to the archipelago, was declared a 
son of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. 
  Fernandez, Deputy Foreign Minister Isabel Allende and 
Spanish 
Ambassador Jose Antonio San Gil were at the airport in Havana to 
see off Hermoso Rojas and his entourage, which comprises a score 
of government officials and businessmen. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Havana, 20 Feb (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina has announced that as of next Saturday he will 
tour six Asian countries, and beginning on 20 March he will 
spend seven days in Spain. 
  Robaina also announced that during the first half of April 
he 
will tour several Latin American nations, thus responding to 
invitations from several regional foreign ministries. 
  During an impromptu news conference following a three-day 
tour of Central Cuba with members of the diplomatic corps, 
Robaina said last night that the first nations he will visit on 
the Asian continent are Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar. He added 
that at present certain aspects of his visits to India, 
Malaysia, and Indonesia are being arranged. 
  This tour of Asia is very important to us because of what 
these countries represent and because several of their foreign 
ministers have paid official visits to Cuba, Robaina said. 
  Robaina also pointed out that acting on an invitation from 
the Spanish Foreign Ministry, he will make a week-long trip to 
that country. 
  Regarding his Latin American tour, Robaina refused to 
disclose any details, saying only that he has received 
invitations from several foreign ministries. He mentioned the 
first half of April as a tentative date for this tour.

  [Text] Havana, 20 Feb (PL) -- Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina has asserted that the renewal of diplomatic relations 
between his country and Chile will ensue when it is most 
appropriate for the latter. He added that Cuba does not wish to 
hasten the formalization of such ties. 
  Robaina made these statements and answered questions posed 
by 
reporters at an improvised news conference last night. He had 
just ended a tour of the central provinces, where he was 
accompanied by the diplomatic corps accredited in Havana. 
  We are not in a hurry or insisting on actions that are 
beyond 
what life itself imposes on all the countries, he said. 
  Regarding Chile and any other country with which we are 
furthering talks to renew diplomatic relations, I would rather 
maintain the same attitude we had with Colombia, Robaina stated. 
  The appropriate time appeared when life itself advised that 
the renewal of relations was desirable, Robaina said in 
reference to the recent renewal of ambassadorial-level relations 
between Colombian and the island. 
  Cuban-Chilean relations were interrupted on 11 September 
1973, when a bloody military coup, headed by General Augusto 
Pinochet, toppled constitutional President Salvador Allende. 
  Currently, bilateral ties are at a consular level.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Carlos Fazio: "Drugs: Over Those </F>
Roads in the South"] 
  [Text] On 9 February the U.S. Government disclosed part of 
its new antidrug strategy. It stressed the importance of 
treatment and prevention of drugs at home, as well as 
alternative economic development and strengthening of the 
institutions charged with combating drug trafficking abroad. 
  In theory, and regarding the international component of the 
new strategy, there seems to be a change of course. Robert 
Gelbard, U.S. assistant secretary of state for international 
drug trafficking affairs, has said that while in the past a 
special effort was made to intercept and seize drug shipments 
destined for the United States, the current plan is aimed at 
cocaine-producing countries, combining eradication of coca 
plants with self-sustained development. 
  In principle it sounds good. The only catch is that this is 
the strategy's publicity portion. During the past few years the 
drug trafficking issue has been at the core of relations between 
Washington and Latin America. In its development this issue has 
been defined by the White House as a national security problem 
and in fact has gradually become a threat to the internal and 
external security of the rest of the area's countries. 
  During the two most recent Republican administrations 
(Reagan- Bush) the concept of "drug trafficking" occupied the 
central spot in the new sociological language on drugs. Stress 
was put on the external nature of this "malignant" problem. The 
core of the problem was thought to consist of narcotics 
trafficking and transportation. 
  In other words, the danger was thought to stem from the 
supply, which the Reagan-Bush administrations regarded as a 
threat to U.S. social and even institutional structures. 
  Since the first Reagan administration, political-strategic 
logic ruled out the drug phenomenon's economic and commercial 
rationale. In the cause-effect diagnosis, ideology replaced 
pragmatism. With the hobbyhorse of "morals," the emphasis on 
solutions was expressed in words like "combat, war, and 
crusade." The Pentagon said it was necessary to combat the 
problem "at its origin" -- production and processing centers -- 
with highly coercive and repressive methods. 
  This argument, which failed to underline the importance of 
demand as the cause of the supply -- and which therefore 
concealed the situation's commercial and financial reality -- 
evidently had a political objective, that is to say, to transfer 
the cost of the fight to the producing countries. 
  Roughly, this has been the story of the failed "war on 
drugs" 
of the past three Republican administrations, with three 
additions. Drugs have also invaded a very specific area -- 
counterinsurgency. 
  Pentagon and Department of State publicity fanned the notion 
of "narcoterrorism" in the framework of a counterinsurgency 
policy, which has to do with the new standard that the U.S. 
Department of State seeks to impose on the subcontinent at the 
end of the Cold War. 
  During the Reagan and Bush administrations, the most 
prominent U.S. proposal to the Latin American drug-producing 
countries was to create a coercive regional counternarcotics 
force, with extraterritorial jurisdiction which could operate 
without the limitations imposed by sovereignty at local borders. 
  In view of the "coca for development" Andean strategy -- 
encouraged by Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori and Bolivian 
President Jaime Paz Zamora -- Washington implemented a policy 
stressing military aspects. 
  Bush, both president of the world's largest 
narcotics-consuming country and the epitome of contradiction, 
avoided facing the problem at home and pressed to mobilize the 
Armed Forces of the "drug countries" into carrying out 
essentially police tasks. 
  In addition, the Pentagon succeeded in establishing some 
posts in area countries, particularly Peru and Colombia. Two 
examples are Santa Lucia military base in the Upper Huallaga in 
a Peruvian coca- producing zone controlled by the Shining Path, 
and a base in Leticia, Colombia in the Amazon area of the border 
with Peru, where 500 U.S. soldiers are stationed. 
  Although Bill Clinton's speech now emphasizes the antidrug 
struggle at home and the budget allocation for the external 
front has been reduced, part of what he failed to say when he 
explained his strategy makes it possible to conjecture that the 
new president will continue to apply some of the former policy's 
central components through the militarization of producing 
countries. 
  It is no mere chance that there are U. S. military engineers 
in Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Guatemala in the framework of 
the "Caminos del Sur/94" exercise. 
  Their alleged tasks hint at the nature of their specific 
assignments, such as training in Guatemala, training and radar 
site installation in Colombia, and participation in the local 
fight against drugs in Bolivia, Ecuador, and Colombia. These are 
functions usually assigned to the police. 
  In reality, the Pentagon has spent a great deal of time and 
money on these actions and has succeeded in involving the CIA 
and DEA. 
  For this reason, we can assume that President Clinton was 
carried away by the momentum of the circumstances. While he says 
one thing in his speeches, in practice he follows and improves 
on previous strategies in Latin American countries.

<F P=106> [By Roberto Gili Colom] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 16 Feb (PL) -- Representatives of the Cuban 
immigration community in the United States agree that opposition 
to the U.S. blockade against Cuba is growing within that sector 
because it is considered an obsolete policy. 
  In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Journalist Francisco 
Gonzalez 
Aruca said the most influential media in the United States as 
well as an important sector of the Cuban immigrant committee 
"consider the blockade to be an obsolete policy." "Little by 
little the more moderate segment of the U.S. Cuban community is 
expressing its rejection of this measure," said Aruca, director 
of Radio Progreso Alternativa in Miami, Florida. 
  On Monday, Havana announced a meeting it calls "The Nation 
and the Immigrant Community." It will be held during the last 
week of April with the participation of approximately 200 
representatives of the Cuban community residing in other 
countries. 
  According to analysts, the blockade imposed by Washington on 
the island for three decades could be one of the subjects 
discussed. 
  Aruca agreed with other immigrants who were asked about this 
issue, meaning that, for the time being, a policy change is 
difficult "because there is still no group strong enough to 
bring about that change in the United States." 
  He said: The influence exerted by the most conservative 
segment of the community, led by the right wing of the 
Cuban-American National Foundation (FNCA) which favors the 
blockade, is equally considerable. 
  Another Cuban immigrant, ARIETO magazine director Andres 
Gomez, said: "The FNCA favors maintaining that policy because it 
coincides with its own interest." 
  "Unquestionably the group within the U.S. Cuban community 
which favors a suspension of the blockade has grown in recent 
years, and states its position more openly," he said. 
  There are those who advocate the unconditional elimination 
of 
the blockade; others endorse it up to a certain point so as to 
negotiate the rest later on, Gomez said.

  [Text] Havana, 16 Feb (PL) -- In allusion to a group of 
persons who entered the Belgian Embassy in Havana, a spokesman 
for the Cuban Foreign Ministry reiterated that entering 
embassies is not an acceptable way of leaving Cuba and that 
those who do so are on the mistaken path. 
  We will not allow this method to be adopted by those intent 
on leaving the country and entering a diplomatic mission cannot 
be a privilege or safe conduct for emigration, the spokesman 
added. 
  It was learned that four men, two women, and a two-year-old 
girl entered the Belgian Embassy on 26 January. 
  The Foreign Ministry spokesman told PRENSA LATINA that Cuba 
has not changed its policy and reiterated that there are 
emigration laws that allow any citizen to travel abroad, as long 
as he has received a visa and paid for the transportation. 
  The spokesman added that those who knowingly, thoughtlessly, 
or out of ignorance or naivete enter an embassy are impairing 
the security of the diplomatic mission. 
  We have cooperated with the Belgian authorities to the 
extent 
that we are allowed and if this matter was not handled earlier 
by the Cuban authorities -- even though the media have been 
reporting on the issue since yesterday -- it was because the 
Belgian authorities requested discretion, the spokesman said. 
  We were not going to go back on our word, the spokesman 
added, but for some reason unknown to us the Belgian Embassy 
officials issued a communique. 
  According to the spokesman, the citizens must leave the 
diplomatic mission voluntarily, return to their homes, and 
undertake the normal steps to leave the country, even if they 
have a visa. 
  The Foreign Ministry spokesman said that entering the 
Belgian 
Embassy will not represent an impediment to or a privilege for 
others who are requesting visas. 
  The spokesman added that only one of the persons in the 
embassy had served time for common crimes and was out on parole. 
He added that the others have no criminal background nor are 
they being persecuted for political reasons. 
  In 1990 four persons entered the Belgian Embassy in Havana 
with the same purpose. They also had to leave the site without 
achieving their goal.

  [Text] Mexico City, 10 Feb (PL) -- The Mexican daily LA 
JORNADA today reported that President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari's government approved the appointment of Abelardo 
Curbelo as the new Cuban ambassador to Mexico. Curbelo will 
assume office in the next few days. 
  LA JORNADA cites statements by outgoing diplomat Jose 
Fernandez de Cossio, who said that "the appointment of the new 
Mexican ambassador to Cuba, Carlos Tello, was approved three 
days ago and that the appointment of the new Cuban ambassador to 
Mexico was also approved." 
  According to Ambassador Fernandez de Cossio, ties between 
the 
two countries "are fine in every sense and there is excellent 
communication. These ties are longstanding and very strong." 
  The Cuban ambassador said Abelardo Curbelo is currently the 
Cuban ambassador to Uruguay, and "will travel to Mexico City 
shortly." 
  Fernandez de Cossio hosted an official farewell reception 
for 
the diplomatic corps accredited in Mexico. Fernandez de Cossio 
has been ambassador to Mexico for the past 10 years. 
  Mexican Tourism Secretary Jesus Silva Herzog; Cuauhtemoc 
Cardenas, presidential candidate for the opposition Party of the 
Democratic Revolution; and Colombian writer Gabriel Garcia 
Marquez were among those attending the farewell reception. 
  Fernandez de Cossio stressed that "for reasons of mutual 
geographic interest, proximity, and cultural and historic 
similarities, the ties between Cuba and Mexico have always been 
particularly strong." 
  The Cuban ambassador also recalled the high degree of 
awareness the two countries have regarding the international 
situation and the role the United Nations should play, as well 
as other important matters of current interest. 
  "We must thank Mexico for the position it has maintained at 
the various international forums against all attempts to isolate 
my small island. This position has been an expression of 
friendship and solidarity which we value highly," Fernandez de 
Cossio said. 
  In conclusion, the Cuban ambassador reiterated the 
expressions of love and affection he has received in the 
approximately 10 years of being in this country. "I take with me 
memories and experiences that in these past few days have been 
heightened by the many expressions of affection I have been 
receiving and which can be summed up by the fact that I have 
been awarded the Order of the Aztec Eagle."

  [Text] Mexico City (DPA) -- Mexico is an excellent toehold 
for economic commitment in the whole of America. This was 
stated by Tyll Necker, president of the Federal Association of 
German Industry (BDI), on Friday during a German-Mexican 
entrepreneurs' meeting before the Technogerma industrial fair, 
which will begin in Mexico City on Monday. In the competition 
of international investment locations, the country benefits from 
its geographical situation and its membership in the North 
American Free Trade Agreement, which was established with the 
United States and Canada on 1 January 1994, he said. 
  Necker and FRG Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free 
Democratic Party of Germany) stressed the successes of Mexico's 
economic policy in combating inflation, consolidating the 
budget, and modernizing the economy. Technogerma is to put the 
attractiveness of Mexico as a business location in its true 
light, said Rexrodt, who had arrived in Mexico, the third leg of 
his trip to America, on Thursday. However, in view of the 
enormous trade balance deficit, Necker and Rexrodt called on 
Mexican entrepreneurs to pay more attention to the European and 
the German market. In 1992, German exports were valued at $2.8 
billion (about 4.6 billion German marks), while imports from 
Mexico only amounted to $600 million. 
  Mexican Commerce and Industry Minister Jaime Serra Puche 
stressed that the establishment of NAFTA does not disadvantage

Mexico's various agreements with other Latin American countries, 
whoever produces in Mexico has access to the markets of more 
countries than anywhere else in America, he said.

<F P=106> [Comments by Cuban President Fidel Castro during a ceremony </F>
marking Radio Rebelde's 36th anniversary at station's Studio 2 
on 25 Feb -- recorded] 
  [Text] Invited by its workers, Commander in Chief Fidel 
Castro today visited Radio Rebelde on the occasion of its 36th 
anniversary. The topic of the dialogue was the rich history of 
this radio station. Furthermore, (Duval Paez), president of the 
Union of Journalists of Cuba, presented Fidel with a diploma 
acknowledging him as a war correspondent. 
  [Paez] Every war correspondent has this diploma in his home. 
  [Castro] Thank you, Tubal. I did not think I would receive 
so 
many honors tonight. I came here to celebrate the 36th 
anniversary, and you have given me a great surprise. Did you 
know I had complained? [crowd chuckles] I complain and always 
will complain [chuckles], first of all because they were 
speaking of all the collaborators in Radio Rebelde. I believe it 
was at the meeting of the Union of Cuban Journalists [UPEC]. I 
asked [name indistinct] why was I not mentioned? [crowd laughs] 
I worked for Radio Rebelde and I had worked as a collaborator. 
Then they forgot about it and I protested, but I did it 
jokingly. I was not serious; it was only a joke. 
  Today, I can see that I was given two diplomas -- one for 
being a collaborator and the other for being a war 
correspondent. I had no other option than to be a war 
correspondent. I had to provide information and news each day. 
That role of providing information on the most important events 
was very important. I believe we will continue talking about 
what Radio Rebelde is. Very little has been said of what Radio 
Rebelde represented. I would suggest we talk about its history: 
how it was organized, when we received the equipment, how much 
power the station had, how it was repaired and maintained. I 
believe that some comrades, such as Eduardo [not further 
identified], can tell us how the station was established because 
the station became much more than we imagined when it was first 
established. 
  [Announcer] After acknowledging all of the station's 
founders, its current workers, and the station's beginnings, 
history, and the role it played as a political instrument of the 
rebel army in the battle against the forces of the dictatorship, 
they spoke about the present: The radio's role in these 
difficult circumstances. 
  [Castro] I can see the decisive role radio plays in these 
times. I could compare this special period, the political moment 
the country is living, with those days of struggle in the Sierra 
Maestra, those days in 1958 that we have been talking about 
here, except that this is a more prolonged period of time. I 
would even say that these are more difficult times than those, 
requiring greater effort, more talent and dedication, work 
carried out under complex situations, especially when the 
economy of the country has received such tremendously hard 
blows, and when only a miracle of determination can explain how 
the country has been able to resist. 
  Today, I see radio in general, not only Radio Rebelde, as 
great in a moment similar to those times -- in a difficult 
moment, a decisive period. I hope the workers, the journalists 
who work in radio are aware of this and are at the level of 
Radio Rebelde in those times. Someday the new generations will 
meet here with the older ones who may live that long to meet 
again. They will have to meet to remember what radio represented 
during these difficult times of the special period. [applause]

  [Text] We will now contact the main engineer at the Mario 
Fortuny Manufactured Gas Plant, comrade (Raul Itina), who will 
give us the latest information on the gas service outage in the 
capital. Good evening, Raul. 
  [(Itina)] Good evening. We are advising you on the situation 
that came up today with regard to supplying the population of 
the city of Havana with manufactured gas. 
  At approximately 0500 this morning, we had an electricity 
outage on both of the circuits that supply the Mario Fortuny gas 
plant with electricity. This breakdown has dragged on because 
one of the electrical substation's transformers has been 
damaged. The comrades from the power company have been working 
on this (?since) very early this morning, and they continue to 
work to solve this situation. 
  As a consequence of this event, gas service has been 
seriously affected today. Sometime tonight -- we think that as 
of 2030, between 2030 and 2100, when the comrades finish -- we 
are going to resume supplying gas, although the service will be 
deficient because the electric company's work is going to 
continue tomorrow, until it is finished. (?Thus), we ourselves 
should be able to normalize the situation sometime tomorrow 
afternoon. 
  That is the information we wanted to give the population.

<F P=106> [Interview with Economist Julio Carranza by mobile unit </F>
reporter Mariela Diaz; place not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Diaz] Carranza, do you think a change in Cuban 
money would solve the excess currency problem? I would also like 
to know your opinion concerning the possible creation of a Cuban 
hard currency certificate, at an exchange rate still to be 
determined, and if this is possible, would it the exchange rate 
be adequate? 
  [Carranza] You are asking two complex questions. And first 
of 
all, these are my personal opinions. I think any of these 
measures you mentioned would be valid but only to the extent 
that they come within a context of measures and are part of a 
sufficiently coherent strategy. As I had said before, the 
economy is a system, and the economy does not operate on 
singular measures, but on well-prepared strategies within which 
the different measures are interconnected, playing a 
supplementary role, and this is what makes the decisions within 
the economic policy effective in the medium- and long-term, and 
also in the short-term. Thus, concerning the question about a 
change in currency, or about the freeze of bank accounts, my 
answer is that it depends on the manner in which the measure is 
implemented; it depends on the context of the strategy adopted. 
  Taking this into consideration, whether it is part of an 
adequate strategy, surely a change in currency could be one of 
the measures that would help restore the country's financial 
balance. However, this very answer leads me to a second 
consideration: that there can be different types of hard 
currency exchange systems. There are different ways of 
exchanging currency. It has to do with the amount of money, and 
the way to handle the future hard currency certificate. There 
are also a set of technical matters that must be considered, and 
they would also depend on the set of measures to be adopted. 
  The same thing would happen concerning a freeze of bank 
accounts during a given period. I would say that discussions on 
a well-prepared proposal, concerning the strategy for the 
country's economic feasibility, contemplate these measures, but 
in a general manner and not as a specific singular measure. 
  [Diaz] Would you say the same thing on the possible creation 
of a convertible Cuban hard currency certificate? 
  [Carranza] Monetary problems of the economy are the most 
complex of any economic system. As a consequence of the 
necessary measures adopted over the past few years to 
counterbalance the current crisis, Cuba has in fact authorized 
the circulation of two different currencies in the country. 
That is, the peso and the rest of the other currencies, which 
are convertible currencies, the most common of which is the 
dollar, as you know. This brings into the economy an abnormal 
situation which has been necessary because of the crisis 
situation as we have already explained it on different occasions. 
  I think that, concerning money circulation, the strategic 
idea would be to recover normalcy within the country's monetary 
structure, and to achieve this, we must seek the reestablishment 
of a single currency in the country. This is my opinion. And 
when I say a single currency, I am saying it in strategic terms, 
referring to a a single money, a Cuban currency that will have 
no other parallel. This does not mean, in strategic terms, that 
possession of currency will be penalized. Possession of currency 
is one thing, while circulation of currency is quite another 
thing. One thing is that a citizen can legally have a given 
amount of currency, but it is a different thing to have this 
money to use as a means of exchange in the economy. This money, 
or the circulation of it, is what I believe must be changed into 
a single currency. Between these currencies, there is the 
possibility of creating this Cuban currency you mentioned, which 
would create a better situation than what we have now, because 
it would be a Cuban currency which would be under better 
control. But in a more strategic context, I think we must strive 
for a single currency that would deal with the exchange rate of 
the Cuban peso, and which will comply with Cuba's true economic 
demands and its relations with other countries. 
  [Diaz] But Julio, suppose the money is collected one way or 
another. I think nothing will be achieved with the money that 
remains and which has no commercial value. That is, we must 
necessarily try to increase production, to increase supply. How 
can the current economic situation be improved when there is a 
scarcity of resources and inefficiency prevails. And how long 
would this recovery take place? Could it be achieved this year? 
  [Carranza] Look, every time this subject is brought up, many 
people rightly say that ultimately the crisis will be solved by 
increasing production. And I believe this is a correct opinion. 
But before that we must ask a question, which I think is a key 
question: How are we going to create the conditions to increase 
production? That is the problem. If production could be 
increased by decree, then the crisis would obviously be solved 
because the problem after all is a production problem. But what 
the economy must do is to restore the conditions for promoting 
production. And here is where all the discussions must focus on 
the measures to be adopted, either short- or long-term measures. 
I think in a first stage -- which will begin when the National 
Assembly of the People's Government adopts the appropriate 
measures -- the objective will not be and could not be to 
increase production, but to restore the balance. What do we have 
within the current situation of financial imbalance? The 
economic upturn process is a very complex task. Under a given 
condition of greater economic balance, where salaries will 
regain their purchasing power and where other conditions will be 
created, we would be creating better conditions -- not just 
conditions, but the best situation for a recovery process. Then, 
this is the first condition I mentioned. We must restore the 
financial balance and create the conditions to increase 
production. 
  Everything that can be done, small actions that can allow us 
to take small steps to increase production, especially the 
efforts being made by workers following their revolutionary 
awareness, is very important. But in general terms, we must 
recover the balance to push national production forward. This is 
the first point, and I am going to the second point. 
  Concerning financial recovery, in order to make an 
evaluation 
of a possible recovery of the economy, we need, among other 
things, statistical data which I do not have at hand at this 
moment. Had I known some details perhaps I could give you a more 
authoritative analysis, but I need some statistical data. But 
what I can say is that under current conditions production 
recovery is a complex and complicated problem. It demands much 
effort. I must also say that although the objective is to grow, 
we must focus on the recovery of the financial balance. 
  I also think that we must also take into account the fact 
that the Cuban economy has dropped considerably over the past 
few years. I can say that it dropped approximately 40 percent, 
and so the economy is already experiencing a tremendous 
downswing, and going lower than that will be very difficult. 
That is, we are experiencing the lowest level, and for this 
reason I believe that a new process could begin in a 
medium-term, a process of change in the economic policy, of a 
slow upturn until, to the extent that the conditions are 
created, production is increased in a more effective manner in 
the medium term. 
  I want to add something which I consider important. It has 
been said that the Cuban international situation is very 
complicated because of the blockade, and because of the 
severance of relations we used to have with the socialist block, 
therefore Cuba depends on a recovery of its production. I want 
to say that these factors are very important, but as I said the 
first day, regardless of the different forms of internal 
production, despite the different economic policies, and despite 
the difficult international relations, the country can give a 
different productive answer. And this is the effort I believe we 
must make, because the economic policy and the organization of 
the productive areas depend on us and not on the world 
situation, although the latter might be very important.

  [Text] An important news conference was held yesterday in 
Washington with the participation of Reverend Lucius Walker, 
Jesse Jackson, and Democratic Congressman Charles Rangel. Listen 
now to a telephone conversation between reporter Zeneida 
Costales and (Yuri Guerra), collaborator in the U.S.-Cuba 
friendship caravan. 
  [Begin recording] [Costales] First of all, we would like to 
know the main points discussed at the news conference. 
  [(Guerra)] Three matters were the focus of the news 
conference: the two Canadian contingents that traveled from 
Vancouver and Montreal to the United States, the ecumenical 
alliance established between the Rainbow Coalition led by Jesse 
Jackson, and (IFCO), the principal organization of the Pastors 
for Peace; and two additional signatures of support to Rangel's 
request for an immediate end to the embargo. This is a victory 
for us -- acquiring new supporters for our cause through the 
U.S. Congress. 
  [Costales] To your knowledge, what impact has this 
conference 
had on the U.S. media? 
  [(Guerra)] This news conference was covered by National 
Public Radio at the national level. As you know, Rev. Jesse 
Jackson is well known in the country and worldwide. This has 
enhanced the importance of the event. 
  [Costales] We appreciate these words by (Yuri Guerra), a 
collaborator in the U.S.-Cuba friendship caravan.

  [Text] Quito -- Government spokesmen have reported that the 
government has initiated a strict austerity program in an effort 
to achieve the economic stability and development goals set for 
the current year. The program includes the elimination of 
investments in new projects and programs, except for those 
projects considered to be of utmost importance. 
  According to the decree issued by the government of 
conservative President Sixto Duran-Ballen, the procurement of 
new domestic and foreign loans now depends on the existence of 
specific financing. The government will not agree to any 
international commitments, agreements, or contracts without 
first ensuring the existence of funds, and commercial contracts 
will only be signed once it has been verified that dependable 
domestic or foreign financing exists to support them.

<F P=106> [Article by Jose David Guevara M.] </F>
  [Text] The same way David confronted Goliath, yesterday, 
several of our manufacturers rejected giant Mexico's most recent 
proposals to small Costa Rica in an attempt to reach a consensus 
on a free trade agreement. That is what producers said when LA 
NACION asked them, by telephone, about their position regarding 
the Mexican Government's offer on such items as vehicle 
exchange, cocoa, candies and marmalades, dairy products, palm 
oil, and textiles. 
  Regarding vehicles, the northern nation asked our 
authorities 
to allow the sale of vehicles here, which they manufacture, with 
hefty tax reductions. This would be Ford, Volkswagen, and 
Chrysler vehicles, among others. Alfredo Levi, BMW manager in 
Costa Rica, said: "What is good for John must also be good for 
Peter." Therefore, he has proposed to the government to design 
an equitable formula so importers of vehicles from other nations 
are not harmed. 
  As far as cocoa is concerned, Mexico proposes that only 
merchandise produced from Mexican and Costa Rican supplies be 
exempt from taxes. According to Belisario Ardon, director of the 
Cocoa Marketing Company, this exemption should not be based on 
this criteria, rather, it should depend on the nation where the 
cacao grain undergoes a substantial transformation. 
  The northern negotiators also offered to open their borders 
to Costa Rica products, like candy and marmalades, which are 
manufactured solely with sugar that has the same price as in the 
United States. Ardon recommends our government not give into 
this demand as this would imply surrendering a significant 
differential in value. He noted: "It would be equal to 
surrendering our advantage." 
  Mexico wants dairy products to be excluded from the 
agreement. Nevertheless, Jose Pattoni, manager of Dos Pinos 
diary, stated this company is very interested in the Mexican 
market, specifically to sell liquid milk. He suggests -- in case 
this chapter were included in the treaty -- Costa Rica exchanges 
"what Mexico does not produce for what we do produce." 
  Regarding palm oil by-products, Mexico would allow us to 
export these with tariffs, which would be eliminated at the end 
of five years, on the condition we purchase their soy bean 
products with no tariffs. Rudy Venegas, industrial marketing 
manager of Numar Company, said it would be fair to implement an 
agreement without any type of tariff for both sides. 
  Rodrigo Arguedas, sales manager of INTEX [expansion 
unknown], 
categorically rejected Mexico's offer to purchase an initial 
quota of 350,000 colones of Costa Rican textiles the first year 
the agreement is implemented. He said: "Costa Rica is capable of 
exporting 150 million colones worth of textiles every year, but 
we could begin with an allotment of 75 million colones."

Olsen promised no new tax packages during his administration. 
What we need are tax reforms and a channeling of all taxes 
through certain groups to prevent the country from going further 
into debt, Figueres said. He also said that the agriculture and 
livestock sector would be strengthened, and negotiations with 
Mexico on the free trade treaty would be analyzed. If the 
country's producers derive no advantage from the treaty it would 
not be signed. Let us listen to the statements made by Engineer 
Jose Maria Figueres, president-elect of our country. 
  [Begin recording] [Figueres] It is a technical matter and it 
will be up to the economic team to define what specific actions 
will be carried out, but I can tell you we are interested in 
solving the fiscal deficit problem. A high fiscal deficit is 
not beneficial for the economy, the Costa Rican people, the 
productive sector, or any one else. Therefore, I think we will 
all be working on that task. This has to do a lot with [words 
indistinct] where we have to be more efficient in collecting 
taxes. This also deals with the expenditures; we have to be 
more austere, more careful in the appropriation of public 
resources. 
  [Madrigal] On the subject of sales tax, the current 
administration increased it 3 percent even though it was always 
at 10 percent. Now it is again 10 percent as was normal. Do 
you think your administration will adjust that tax? 
  [Figueres] I do not think the country needs a new tax 
package. I think the country certainly needs tax reforms in 
which we have four or five kinds of taxes instead of having more 
than 100 taxes. Also, those taxes should be easy to calculate, 
easy to collect, and they should be easily and efficiently 
controlled. Furthermore, those who have more should pay more, 
and those who have less should pay less. In that sense, we are 
interested in progressive taxes, rather than regressive taxes, 
because those who have more pay more taxes. 
  Definitely, due to the current administration's a lack of a 
clear policy to encourage the agricultural and livestock sector, 
we have seen a considerable decline in cattle herds. 
Furthermore, the numbers indicate that Costa Rica is on the 
verge of going from being a meat exporting country to a meat 
importing country, but we will be working very closely with the 
country's cattle sector. The policies we will define to 
reactivate the cattle sector will be worked out with this 
country's cattlemen; and there will be policies to give priority 
to credit, productivity, and efficiency in the handling of 
cattle herds so this tendency may be reversed. 
  [Madrigal] Regarding the free trade treaty with Mexico, 
Costa 
Rica carried out a negotiation but it closed the chapter on 
agricultural issues without really negotiating anything because 
no basic product was included. What would your position be if 
you were to take office and the treaty were still unsigned? 
Would you continue to give priority to the agricultural 
segment? Would you not sign that treaty with Mexico? 
  [Figueres] Well, we have said that we are interested in 
continuing negotiations on the treaty with Mexico. We are 
interested because it would open new markets for our export 
products. However, we have also made it clear that those 
treaties must be negotiated, on the Costa Rican side, by a team 
that is made up of government people and people from the 
productive sector. If the production sector is not satisfied, 
does not agree with, or does not feel comfortable with the 
agreement, then it will not be useful to us. In that sense, if 
nothing has been signed with Mexico when we take office, we 
would continue to work hand in hand with the nation's producers, 
in the industrial as well as the agricultural fields, to see 
what kind of treaty we sign with Mexico. [end recording] 
  The tour Jose Maria Figueres Olsen was scheduled to begin in 
a few days has been rescheduled, because issues such as the 
creation of the commission that will organize the transfer of 
power, as well as the creation of the Figueres administration 
cabinet that will be sworn in on 8 May, shall be analyzed this 
week.

  [Excerpts] The Movement for the Organization of the Country 
[MOP] has come out against the accusations of intransigence and 
bad faith brought against the Haitian head of state. President 
Aristide cannot be held responsible for the failures already 
recorded. [passage omitted] 
  The party is convinced that one cannot support the return of 
President Aristide while seeking the best way to implement 
Article 148 of the Constitution [which provides for assumption 
of power by the prime minister in the event the president of the 
Republic is unavailable]. Likewise, one cannot be opposed to the 
bloody 30 September coup d'etat and at the same time support the 
clean-sweep policy or reactivation of Article 149 [which 
provides for the Court of Cassation president to act as 
provisional president of the country pending new presidential 
elections within 45 to 90 days]. [passage omitted] 
  The MOP, which is not promoting any candidacy for the post 
of 
prime minister at this time, urges the entire diplomatic sector 
to unite in demanding respect for the Constitution, the 
commitments made at Governors Island, the end of repression, 
full enjoyment of public liberties, safety guarantees for all, 
the normalization of institutions, and the return of President 
Aristide on 29 March so he can complete his constitutional 
mandate. This is not a difficult solution to enact. 
  The year 2004 [marking the bicentennial of Haiti's 
independence] will soon be here. So let us make this 29 March 
the starting point for preparation of a grand celebration of the 
bicentennial of national independence. 
  MOP leader Gesner Comeau supports the counterproposal sent 
to 
UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali by President Aristide. 
This new plan worked out by the head of state provides for his 
return to Haiti during the 10 days that follow the appointment 
of the new prime minister. Let us listen to Gesner Comeau. 
  [Begin recording, in Creole] I think that if such a plan is 
applied, it would be perfect and in the interest of the waiting 
Haitian people. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] Once again General Raoul Cedras did not show up. 
For the second consecutive day, he did not answer a call from 
the second office of the Senate. Nevertheless Senator Romel 
Manigat remains optimistic about a positive response from the 
commanding general of the Army. This delay is understandable: 
He is preparing his case, the senator stated. 
  [Begin Manigat recording, in Creole] (?Despite the delay), 
we 
have no doubt that the commander will come because Gen. Cedras 
is a man of honor, he is a man of his word, a man who knows how 
to respect his commitments toward the Senate. So, we believe 
the case is so important that we cannot treat it thoughtlessly. 
If the high command deems it necessary to take some time to 
present a good case, it is normal that we, Senate members and 
wise men, understand the difficulties and we will wait for him 
because the steps we have taken have not been taken for 
ourselves, but have been taken on behalf of the Haitian nation. 
The military institution really needs to provide many 
explanations to the Haitian community. [end recording] 
  The senators waited until very late for the arrival of Gen. 
Raoul Cedras. Sen. Thomas Eddy Dupiton was sent to the Army 
General Headquarters to inquire about this delay. According to 
Sen. Dupiton, the commander in chief of the Army was trying to 
contact the various commands in the nine geographic departments 
of the country before coming to the Senate to answer the 
senators' questions. However, there was tension, sharp tension 
at the Senate. Sen. Bernard Sansaricq even demanded a vote on a 
censure motion against Gen. Raoul Cedras, an idea that is not 
shared by some parliamentarians including Sen. Dupiton, Sen. 
Ebrane Cadet, and Sen. Margareth Martin.

  [Excerpts] For the second consecutive day, the senators 
waited in vain for the Army commander in chief who they say had 
promised to appear at a Senate convening. The legislators' 
patience was put to a severe test by the Army commander who the 
legislators say had given his word to attend this session. 
  Senator Bernard Sansaricq has condemned the general's 
attitude. The president of the second Senate office could not 
contain his reprobation and anger. He had hoped for the 
formation of a new government as a solution to the political 
crisis. Edner Jean filed a report on the day in the Senate: 
  [Begin recording] [Dupiton in Creole] The general did not 
give a date when he commented on the complexity of the case to 
me. I understood and did not ask him for a date. He told me only 
that he was considering the situation and that at the 
appropriate time, he would come because he understands. [end 
recording] 
  [Jean in French] This report on the meeting planned with the 
Army commander in chief had the effect of putting a damper on 
the enthusiasm of the senators of GARD, Action Group for the 
Recovery and Defense of National Sovereignty, who finally 
revealed on 23 February the contents of the well-announced 
surprise -- formation of a new government to manage state 
matters. 
  The convening of General Cedras was most likely planned as a 
catalyst to begin the process of definitely excluding President 
Aristide. However, the absence of the general came to disturb 
the plan already implemented by those senators, an affront for 
which Bernard Sansaricq will not forgive General Cedras. It is a 
serious insult. The Army commander in chief must give an account 
to the nation, asserted Sansaricq. Senator Sansaricq is willing 
to go to Army Headquarters to demand the resignation of Gen. 
Cedras. [passage omitted] 
  This statement had the effect of shocking the Senate of the 
Republic, led for some time by just one political current, that 
of GARD. Most of the members of this body for the first time 
clearly dissociated themselves from the stance of their 
president. [passage omitted] 
  Finally, Sen. Belizaire intervened at the podium, asking for 
the withdrawal from the agenda of the point concerning the 
attendance of Gen. Cedras, which would be postponed 
indefinitely. This does not detract from the determination of 
those senators to form a new government in the country. [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Alejandro Arturo Flores in Santa Ana; from the </F>
"YSU Radio News" newscast] 
  [Excerpt] The takeover of the western penal facility by 
numerous inmates is into its fourth hour without any sign of a 
solution. So far two people are reported dead and two injured. 
We shall now hear from Gabriel Abraham Paniagua, president of 
the political committee of Armed Forces prisoners, who was 
wounded in his left arm. 
  [Begin recording] [Paniagua] Our people began to arm 
themselves with pieces of sharp steel. 
  [Flores] What do the inmates want? 
  [Panigua] The problem is that the people up front saw the 
soldiers fighting so the rest joined in. The other inmates 
joined in, although they normally do not bother anyone, but they 
were wounded so they joined in the fight against those from 
Gotera. They want to kill them because the problem is that if 
these people are left alive and we are transferred, then they 
will kill us in the other jail. Do you understand? That is why 
the inmates do not want to leave these types alive. 
  Regrettably, the National Guard troops only have to knock 
the 
doors down. We are a disciplined group who obey prison 
regulations. You understand? When I get back, if things have 
calmed down, just as we promised, those who have armed 
themselves will turn over their pocket knives at the front door. 
As you can see, we do not bother anyone. We live for our work 
and our families. We would have preferred some warning 
because... [pauses] [words indistinct] thefts and stabbings have 
increased these past few days. Recently, seven inmates were 
wounded. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Salvadoran Edgardo Rodriguez, National </F>
Solidarity Movement, MNS, presidential candidate, by 
unidentified PRENSA GRAFICA reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Do you consider your economic program 
substantially different than the one the government has 
implemented? What are your main points? 
  [Rodriguez] MNS' government platform contains general and 
specific objectives. Five of our general objectives are the 
following: the elimination of poverty as an essential factor; 
simultaneous sustained development and social development; the 
broadening of the business sector; the modernization of the 
state; and a change of the nation's economy toward a solidarity 
economy. 
  A solidarity economy is one that seeks a better distribution 
of the nation's economic surplus. Arena's [Nationalist 
Republican Alliance] "Achilles heel" is the thesis of monetarism 
it has implemented. The ripple effect theory has not been 
produced simultaneously with economic growth. A social economy 
market is not the most adequate label for the current model. 
  [Reporter] According to your proposal, what is missing in 
the 
current model? 
  [Rodriguez] There is a lack of openness in the market, and 
the tendency is not toward fair competition. 
  There are monopolies and oligopolies that influence 
important 
products in El Salvador. We could mention, for example, 
fertilizers, which have a bearing on all the basic grains. 
There are companies that have imported shiploads of 
fertilizers. The decisions of such a powerful group of 
speculators has an influence on prices. 
  We will not discuss progress, rather, extreme liberalism, 
which has put the businessmen who for many years supported the 
economy in a difficult situation. A market economy encourages 
equal conditions and openness. The state should regulate and 
orientate. 
  [Reporter] What does it mean the state should be the 
economic regulator without intervening in the market? 
  [Rodriguez] For example, by not exporting beans. What 
happened last year? Since Antonio Cabrales, agriculture and 
livestock minister, talked about a record harvest of cereals, 
speculators have decided to export beans to Nicaragua and 
Honduras, leaving our people hungry. 
  We do not think the state should intervene in certain 
matters 
but should in the food supply and strategic industries. 
  [Reporter] Would you, for example, fix prices for strategic 
products? 
  [Rodriguez] No. I would not, but I would prohibit the export 
of basic grains until the local market is guaranteed, and I 
would promote their production. 
  I would support the small producers with credits, low 
interest rates so they can produce more. In that case, the law 
of the market would work, because there would be a surplus. 
  [Reporter] What is the difference between what you are 
proposing for the state and what the PDC [Christian Democratic 
party] has, for example? 
  [Rodriguez] We would have the control and organization to 
enforce regulation, but we would not take over the role of the 
private sector. The PDC has intervened in the economy and 
substituted the private sector. This was an error, as it 
generated corruption. Neither did we believe in liberalism as 
applied by the government, where anything goes. 
  We believe the market economy strategy should be preserved, 
but social responsibility should be included. This is 
solidarism's proposal based on its two pillars, active 
participation and social responsibility in the nation's problems. 
  [Reporter] What measure would you apply, if these have a 
name, to make social development effective? 
  [Rodriguez] We are not going to entitle these measures, 
rather, criteria. In the government's strategy the ripple 
effect thesis is upheld. Its theory is to have investment there 
must be savings--it is axiomatic--and to have savings there must 
be a concentration of wealth. What have they done? They have 
promoted the large companies so they can concentrate wealth, 
save, and from there generate investments. 
  The truth is investment generated from the concentration of 
wealth in a few sectors does not translate into broad benefits. 
  We want to broaden the base of the private sector. We are 
talking about the poor in the marketplace, the shoemaker, the 
small businessmen who do not have access to credit. We want to 
promote them to strengthen the local market and to integrate 
them into an export economy similar to the Taiwanese model, 
where the family business has been essential in the export 
process. 
  [Reporter] What do these views mean specifically? Tax 
reforms? A change in the interest rate? Subsidies with 
international aid? 
  [Rodriguez] The assistant World Bank director visited us two 
months ago and informed us the IMF and the World Bank and other 
international organizations have given priority to supporting 
programs to eradicate poverty in developing countries. 
  These institutions pressured the countries of Latin America 
during the 1980's to make structural changes so they could 
improve their economies, and they then realized this caused an 
enormous level of poverty. The UN Development Program points to 
the imbalance: Twenty percent of the world's population earns 82 
percent of the world's income, and conversely 80 percent of the 
population earns 18 percent of the world's income. This tells 
us of the errors that even institutions such as the World Bank 
and the IMF have made in their policies. We hope to raise the 
national tax rate from 9 to 11 percent. We believe the 
value-added tax must be reformed. Everything that hurts the 
basic family basket and medicines must be eliminated. There 
should be a tax on luxury items, namely, jewelry, expensive 
clothes, and a stiffer tax on nonessential items, such as luxury 
cars. We plan to revise the tax law chiefly on income and 
family goods to make the wealthier pay more. 
  We also have international loans that have been negotiated 
lately. We know those resources will be effective. It is a 
matter of time. An important element we are considering is 
austerity in public administration. We plan to lower the fiscal 
deficit with austerity. There is no reason for the government 
to promote costly publicity campaigns such as the current one. 
  We will lower the Armed Forces budget. Why spend on 
television programs? Every night, they pay for a program on all 
channels. That money could be eliminated from the budget to 
lower the deficit. We are going to dispense with armored 
vehicles for public officials and lower traveling expenses. 
  We are even going to review the president's confidential 
expenditures. There is no reason for them to be confidential, 
but we must lower them to begin with. A Treasury Ministry union 
has told us some months ago the president withdrew 22 million 
colones in one day. For what? 
  We have a major resource abroad sending us large amounts of 
foreign exchange. We do not think those resources should be 
oriented toward the purchase of houses, as that is consumption. 
We must create an entity that steers those resources toward 
productive investments. In addition, we are proposing a reform 
in the foreign service. The southeastern Asian countries will 
encounter problems entering the United States. With an 
investment program brought before companies from Taiwan, 
Singapore, etc., we could become the entry point into the United 
States, making use of the advantages we still have under the 
General Preference System, the Caribbean Basin Initiative, and 
what remained of the Initiative for the Americas. 
  There is also the possibility of strengthening the 
integration of the isthmus, given figures indicate El Salvador's 
level of commerce with the region has registered a big increase. 
  [Reporter] The National Solidarity Movement did not complete 
the registration of candidates in all municipalities; yet you 
said the party's position is good. On what do you base your 
optimism? 
  [Rodriguez] We believe we are fighting for a second or third 
position nationwide. We were planning to run in 120 
municipalities but have entered 80 races for a lack of 
resources. We are running excellent candidates, however. We 
believe we can win in 40 percent of those 80 municipalities. If 
we are in fourth place, according to the polls, we will win a 
minimum of 12 deputies. At the presidential level we are making 
a major effort to maintain a higher profile. We think we are 
winning great support. In addition, everywhere we go we have 
found the support of the people from the churches, the Catholic 
and Evangelical Churches. We have candidates who belong to the 
Elim Church, Mormons, winners who will win in major centers. We 
have put forth the best we could without compromising the party. 
We trust in the people's sensible nature.

  [Text] Just a few minutes ago, retired Lieutenant Colonel 
Francisco Arias Cardenas met with President Rafael Caldera. 
Coming out of the meeting, Arias Cardenas said the meeting is 
the first step toward pacification. He also reiterated his 
commitment to those companions who in jail. 
  [Begin Arias Cardenas recording] Basically, the reason for 
my 
being here today, at Miraflores Palace, accompanied by Captain 
Luis Valderrama and members of my family, is for an initial 
rapprochement with President Rafael Caldera. In all sincerity, I 
believe we are living in a somewhat new atmosphere which favors 
change and brings hope. I feel the changes -- or the beginning 
of the changes that started 4 February and 27 November 1992 -- 
are become stronger; one indication of this is that we have a 
new government which the Venezuelan people elected on 5 December 
1983. [as heard] Our conversation mainly covered the political 
prisoners and the pacification process promoted by the president 
of the Republic. [end recording] 
  Last night after the dismissal of his case and the case of 
nine other officers who participated in the first coup attempt 
of 1992, retired Lt. Col. Arias Cardenas said that to accept 
pardon does not mean he regrets his past actions. Arias Cardenas 
held an impromptu news conference on Los Proceres Avenue, during 
which he clarified that those who have been released are not 
abandoning those who are in prison. He feels it is just a matter 
of using different methods of struggle, adding that each 
individual's stand is respected. 
  [Begin Arias Cardenas recording] One cannot think that the 
person who is in jail or who has been released is courageous or 
cowardly. There are different ways of confronting the truth, 
which we must do at this time, as a responsibility because of 
the trust all Venezuelans have. [sentence as heard] In the first 
place, I firmly declare that I am in complete solidarity with 
the companions who remain in prison and with their proposals. 
[end recording] 
  Arias Cardenas, who is considered the ideologist of the 4 
February 1992 coup attempt, pointed out that he is not ruling 
out participating in political activities if the circumstances 
so determine it. He explained that he requested his retirement 6 
months ago precisely to engage in politics.

  [Text] Mexico City, 24 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari has voiced optimism over the rapid progress 
being made in the dialogue to seek a "dignified and just peace" 
in southeastern Chiapas State, and he has reaffirmed his 
commitment to furthering democracy in Mexico. 
  Salinas de Gortari said: "This is a dignified and just 
peace, 
and this is exactly what we have been striving for. Without a 
doubt, I am encouraged by the results announced yesterday and 
the progress being made." 
  Today in the Chiapas town of San Cristobal de las Casas, 
Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation, 
and the armed group began their fourth day of talks amid 
substantial progress in an effort to find a political solution 
to the conflict that began on 1 January. 
  Interviewed at the conclusion of a "Flag Day" ceremony in 
Mexico City, Salinas de Gortari commended the peace 
commissioner's work by saying, "he is working with utmost 
dedication, complete loyalty and commitment, and with great 
patriotism." Camacho Solis "is earnestly performing the task I 
entrusted upon him (on 10 January), and the fact that the 
dialogue is advancing so rapidly is certainly pleasing," the 
president noted. 
  In confirming the announcement Camacho Solis made yesterday, 
Salinas de Gortari indicated the peace commissioner "has been in 
permanent contact with me, and I have authorized him to proceed 
with the proposals he has made." The president said the peace 
commissioner has been instructed that "in terms of the Indians' 
social demands," he should be "generous with his responses." 
  Yesterday, the Zapatist National Liberation Army said it had 
received a "satisfactory response" to one-fourth of its demands 
regarding health, education, housing, communications, and 
respect for Indian traditions and rights. 
  Also during the impromptu interview, President Salinas de 
Gortari commented on the recent talks between the Government 
Secretariat and the nation's political parties concerning the 21 
August federal elections. 
  "I am convinced we need to take additional steps in 
advancing 
the country's democratic life," the president stated, while 
emphasizing his commitment to promote the advancement of 
democracy in Mexico. He added, "As a citizen, I may have -- 
certainly, as each one of you have -- an (electoral) preference, 
but as president of the Republic I am committed to an impartial 
and democratic election." 
  Earlier, during the "Flag Day" ceremony headed by Salinas de 
Gortari at the midtown Constitution Plaza, the Armed Forces 
reiterated their support for the pacification process in Chiapas 
-- a process the president began on 10 January. 
  "We are not indifferent to the efforts you and your 
government have made and are still making to resolve the 
problems we face, some of which date back a long time, others of 
which are new," General Alvaro Vallarta Cecena stated. The 
commander of the 16th Military Zone continued, "These problems 
are complex and difficult to resolve because of the balance that 
must be maintained in an effort to avoid isolating people in a 
world that is becoming more interdependent and more demanding." 
  The military chief added, "The defense of the fatherland in 
this new world requires a flair and unity that will withstand 
all tests, combining in a balanced manner family with society, 
nationalism with internationalism."

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Armenta Avila; from the "ACIR Radio </F>
News" newscast] 
  [Text] [Armenta] Today's negotiations have extended, and 
the statements to the press by Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho 
Solis and Subcommander Marcos will take place at 2000 at the San 
Cristobal de las Casas Cathedral, which has been renamed the 
Cathedral of Peace. 
  We have been informed the negotiations extended because the 
peace commissioner and Subcommander Marcos held a meeting with 
representatives of nongovernment organizations who have staged a 
security siege around the cathedral since 19 February. 
  We have been informed reporters will have access to the 
cathedral at 1930, 30 minutes before the participants give 
statements. 
  [Unidentified announcer] Is that within one hour? 
  [Armenta] Correct. 
  In the meantime, Subcommander Marcos said this morning the 
political parties are more interested in leading the talks than 
in resolving problems. Subcommander Marcos met again this 
Thursday with representatives of the media, particularly radio 
media, which did not have access to the San Cristobal de las 
Casas Cathedral yesterday. 
  The EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army] subcommander 
said the representatives of the parties with whom he met on 22 
February never heard his demands and just argued among 
themselves, as if they were at the Chamber of Representatives. 
Marcos explained no agreement was signed with representatives 
of the PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution], PDM [Mexican 
Democratic Party], Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction 
Party, Mexican Green Ecologist Party, and the Labor Party to 
incorporate the EZLN demands to the political platforms of each 
of these parties. He added: It seems they only came to have 
their pictures taken with the EZLN delegates. 
  [Begin Subcommander Marcos recording] Certain parties did 
not 
come due to the masks with which we are covering our faces. 
They think that is not hygienic. Others prefer to wait and see 
what will happen or perhaps fear the movement wants them here to 
accuse or attack them. 
  We expected those who came would listen to us; instead, they 
came and said hello. We tell them we want them to monitor the 
talks and not leave us alone. We told them we are ready to 
follow the path of peace, if it will lead to an obtainment of 
our demands. Then they started to talk and discuss, as if they 
were at the Chamber of Deputies. We then waited until they 
stopped talking. They were not talking to us at that point. 
Then, one of them said we, the party of national or 
international journalists, want.... [pauses] Then another party 
official got upset and said we.... [pauses] Then they started a 
debate [words indistinct]. 
  We waited to see when they would become tired, and when we 
realized they would never become tired, we told them we had to 
go, because the beans were getting cold. [end recording] 
  [Armenta] The EZLN subcommander insisted on the need for the 
presidential candidates to commit themselves to respecting the 
accords that may be signed here at the San Cristobal table, so 
that whoever wins the elections follows up on these commitments. 
  I can also report the members of the Special Commission for 
Peace of the Mexican Bishops Conference are here in San 
Cristobal de las Casas. They are six bishops, led by Adolfo 
Suarez Rivera. Also here is Oaxaca Bishop Hector Gonzalez; 
Carlos Talavera of Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz; Raul Vera, dominican 
bishop; Francisco Aguirre, Tuxtla Gutierrez bishop; and Felipe 
Arizmendi of Tapachula. 
  We have been informed the bishops will speak to reporters 
tomorrow to give their viewpoints of the peace and 
reconciliation negotiations. Within 30 minutes, the six bishops 
who form the Special Commission will hold a mass here at Santo 
Domingo Square.

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, 24 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- 
Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis and the Zapatist 
National Liberation Army [EZLN] announced today they have 
advanced 50 percent in the demands presented to attain peace in 
Chiapas. 
  Upon concluding their fourth day of meetings at the 
cathedral 
of this city, both parties reported on the development of the 
conversations initiated 21 February to end the armed conflict, 
which erupted in Chiapas last 1 January. 
  "Things have continued to advance, and today we have been 
able to reach agreements on 50 percent of the issues that have 
been presented to us" by the armed group, Camacho told the 
national and international press gathered at the "Cathedral of 
Peace." 
  "We see in this the opportunity not only to answer one 
question but to achieve a broad consensus regarding these 
accords to attain a political solution to the conflict in 
Chiapas and regarding the peace accord," the peace commissioner 
added. 
  "Subcommander Marcos" said among the points on which 
progress 
has been made are the electrification of Indian communities and 
the redistribution of public investment in the state, as well as 
demands on health, truthful information, and housing. 
  NAFTA's impact on the Indian communities also received a 
satisfactory response at the negotiations in the Chiapas city of 
San Cristobal, 1,200 km southeast of the Mexican capital. 
  Regarding education, the parties agreed to build schools, 
provide them with school supplies, train teachers, and establish 
mandatory and official bilingual education in the Indian 
communities. 
  The respect for Indian tradition and culture, the punishment 
for discrimination and prejudice against Indians, the problem of 
nourishment, and economic support to the victims of war have 
also been discussed at the negotiations. 
  The need to create a National Peace Commission in charge of 
following up to ensure compliance with the agreements and the 
multiplication and strengthening of nongovernmental human rights 
organizations are within the 50-percent advancement. 
  In addition, the peace commissioner and the 19 EZLN 
delegates 
agreed humanitarian aid in the areas of conflict must be 
channeled through "authentic" representatives of Indian 
communities. 
  Both sides concurred the agreements reached in principle 
will 
be consulted with the highest Mexican authorities and with the 
Indian communities in Chiapas for their final approval. 
  The agreements will also be presented to the public in order 
to gather opinions and seek a consensus around the so-called 
"peace with dignity," according to "Subcommander Marcos," the 
rebel group's military chief. 
  Camacho recalled this Thursday is national flag day, 
stressing the importance of maintaining and defending 
territorial integrity, and of finding a solution for the Chiapas 
conflict in Mexico, by Mexicans, on the basis of dialogue and 
mutual respect. 
  The conditions of neglect and poverty faced by the Indians 
in 
Chiapas is what led to the emergence of the rebel group, one of 
the delegates who identified himself as "Juan" said, reiterating 
the demands for work, housing, land, freedom of expression, and 
democracy. 
  "We Indians are also struggling for a respect of our dignity 
as Indians," he said. 
  Both sides will continue the talks on 25 February, based on 
the list of demands presented by the rebel group on 22 February.

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico, 23 Feb (NOTIMEX) 
-- As one of its main proposals for achieving reconciliation in 
the region, the self-styled Zapatist National Liberation Army 
(EZLN) today called for the establishment of a cogovernment with 
the Indians in southeastern Chiapas state. During a news 
conference with radio reporters before the start of today's 
talks, EZLN Subcommander Marcos explained that Indian groups had 
to participate in this cogovernment to find adequate solutions 
to their problems. 
  Marcos also proposed the creation of a dialogue verification 
commission made up of civilians. Commission members would be 
appointed by the EZLN and Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho 
Solis. This commission would prevent solutions agreed upon at 
the talks from becoming empty promises and, in turn, avert the 
risk of another armed conflict. 
  On 1 January, armed groups from the EZLN seized several 
Chiapas communities by force, attacked a garrison, and prompted 
the intervention of the Mexican Army. These actions resulted in 
nearly 100 deaths, numerous injuries, and the displacement of 
about 20,000 people. 
  "We are aware of the difficulties in meeting our national 
demands, such as the reform of Article 27 of the Constitution 
(on land tenure)," Marcos stated, admitting that such issues "go 
beyond the work agenda agreed upon by both sides." 
  The EZLN military chief, who was interviewed in San 
Cristobal 
de las Casas, 1,200 km to the southeast of Mexico City, admitted 
that it is not possible to force peace in Chiapas "to get the 
country to do what we want." [sentence as received] 
  According to Marcos, the EZLN is not looking for power. 
Instead, it only wants peace with justice. He also added: We 
do not want to form a political party, so that later someone can 
say that we sold out. "However, we ask for the reform of the 
Federal Electoral Law in order that the upcoming elections 
(scheduled for 21 August) are observed and supported," he said. 
  The Zapatist spokesman welcomed the role of Manuel Camacho 
Solis, the commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, 
who has heard the Indian requests with an open mind conducive to 
finding solutions. Subcommander Marcos said two things can 
happen in this dialogue: The negotiations can further peace, or 
they can break down and engender another war. 
  When asked whether he believed he was personally upstaging 
others involved in the peace process, Marcos explained, "The 
movement has utilized me because I am the only one who speaks 
Spanish. However, the proposals were ordered by the EZLN 
leaders. I simply have a military assignment."

closely. Things are moving appropriately. We have already agreed 
on 50 percent of the issues presented to us today. 
  In this, we not only see the opportunity to satisfactorily 
answer the demands but it is also an opportunity to produce a

Chiapas conflict and on the peace agreements. 
  Today is Mexico's Flag Day. Today's Flag Day celebration in 
San Cristobal de las Casas has special significance for the 
negotiations. The Mexican flag allows us to: 
  1. Maintain and defend Mexico's territorial integrity. 
  2. Resolve the Chiapas conflict in Mexican territory. 
  3. Search for dialogue instead of confrontations because we 
trust Mexico and in its future. 
  4. It is necessary we reach agreements and respect each 
other to build a better fatherland. 
  This is what I had to say today. Thank you for being here. 
You are very kind.

Liberation Army, on talks with the Mexican Government, in San 
Cristobal de las Casas on 24 February; from the "24 Hours" 
newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] I speak on behalf of the Zapatist National 
Liberation Army [EZLN] to inform the people of Mexico, the 
people and the governments of the world, and the national and 
foreign media about the results of today's meeting with National 
Mediation Commissioner Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia and Manuel 
Camacho Solis, national commissioner for peace and 
reconciliation in Chiapas. 
  We have resolved 50 percent of the listed demands. We have 
already received a satisfactory response to the following points 
included on the list of demands presented by the Indian 
Revolutionary Clandestine Committee -- General Command of the 
EZLN. 
  One of these points calls for the electrification of the 
Indian communities and the redistribution of federal investments 
in the State of Chiapas. Another point deals with the impact of 
the free trade agreement on the Indian communities. Another 
point has to do with health, truthful information -- as we 
reported yesterday -- housing, education -- which involves the 
construction of schools, school equipment, and the availability 
of teachers -- obligatory and official bilingual education in 
the Indian communities, respect for Indian traditions and 
culture, punishment for anyone discriminating or showing 
contempt for the Indians, the food problem, economic support for 
the victims of the war and for the widows and orphans of the 
conflict, the demands of the women on what should be done so 
that the Indians may live in peace, the multiplication and 
strengthening of nongovernment human rights organizations, the 
need to form -- at the adequate moment -- a national peace 
commission with justice and honor that will be in charge of 
following up on the agreements reached during these 
negotiations, and the channeling of humanitarian aid to the 
conflict zone through the authentic representatives of the 
Indian communities. This is the last point on which we agreed. 
  These are the agreements we have reached so far. I repeat: 
Fifty percent of the demands presented by the committee have 
been satisfactorily met by the commissioner.

<F P=106> [Report by Jesus Casasola; from the "ACIR Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] During the 100 marches organized by the Party of the 
Democratic Revolution [PRD], the authorities have not reported 
any major incident, except for traffic jams that are affecting 
thousands of drivers. The streets most affected by these 
demonstrations are La Reforma, Juarez, Higaldo, Insurgentes, 
Puente de Alvarado, (?Tlalpan), Fray Cervando, and the entire 
first block [cuadro], among other major areas. The General 
Safety and Roads Secretariat as well as the Federal District 
Attorney General's Office have reported despite the large number 
of people participating in the demonstrations, there have been 
no incidents so far. 
  The Neighborhood Assemblies comprised the largest group seen 
on Thursday. The demonstrators tried to reach Los Pino's 
official residence but only got to (?Chivatito) Plaza. 
Presidential residence officials met with a delegation of this 
group. Despite the intense heat, demonstrators at one point 
marched on the sidewalks but then took to the streets, 
congesting traffic, mainly in the historic midtown area. 
Demonstrators are gathering there after concluding their 
marches. The situation has grown worse, because most of the 
people who came from Toluca, Mexico State, and had been 
gathering at the Guadalupe Basilica since yesterday have begun 
to return to their homes by buses, bicycles, or on foot. Some 
people are walking on the sidewalks, while others are walking on 
the asphalt roads; that is, on avenues and streets. The Relief 
and Medical Emergency Squad and the Red Cross have reported 
during the course of these demonstrations they cared for 37 
people who succumbed to insolation or fatigue. None of them had 
to be hospitalized and were simply cared for on the spot. 
Bearing placards and shouting, the demonstrators have demanded 
housing and, by the same token, better wages and a better 
administration of justice or respect for human rights; others 
marched to support peace via dialogue in Chiapas. Private and 
public offices closed their doors to keep demonstrators out. 
The same thing happened in certain political offices in the 
Federal District Department, Chamber of Deputies, and the Mexico 
City Attorney General's Office. I repeat: There have been no 
major incidents, according to the information provided by the 
Federal District authorities. That is what we have so far, but 
we will continue to follow the situation, because several groups 
are moving toward Zocalo, causing serious problems and traffic 
chaos, primarily in Mexico City's first block. Although the 
General Safety and Roads Secretariat deployed 3,000 agents, I 
would describe the situation as chaotic. I would say it is 
impossible to control the traffic chaos, which, I repeat, is 
mainly taking place in the historic area.

  [Text] Mexico City, 22 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Mexican Foreign 
Relations Secretary Manuel Tello Macias has stated that 
relations between Mexico and Germany are at a very high level 
with regard to cooperation, political dialogue, and economic 
exchange. Tello met with German Economy Minister Gunter Rexrodt 
and stated that 31 percent of all Mexican trade in the region 
had been carried out with Germany and, thus, it had become 
Mexico's leading commercial partner in Europe in 1993. 
  Rexrodt, who is in Mexico since last Thursday [17 February], 
to preside over the inauguration of "Technogerma-Mexico 1994," 
expressed his satisfaction with Mexico's economic reforms. He 
said the implementation of the free trade agreement between 
Mexico, the United States, and Canada stirs great expectations 
among German investors.

  [Excerpt] Mexico City, 21 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- [passage ommited] 
  The German minister [German Economy Minister Gunter 
Rexrodt], 
who has been on an official visit here since last Thursday, 
asserted that placing limits on exports will only lead to 
bilateralism, which runs against multinational agreements. He 
explained that such a decision "would violate GATT and would 
conflict with the interests of the world's large exporting 
nations." 
  Rexrodt said his country's investments in Mexico will 
increase if Mexico signs an agreement for reciprocal promotion 
and protection of investments. In 1993, 31 percent of Mexico's 
exports to Europe went to Germany and, in turn, Germany became 
Mexico's foremost commercial partner in the region. 
  After meeting with Mexican Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello 
Macias, Rexrodt explained that Germany has given Mexico priority 
status in its relations with Latin America. An example of this, 
he said, is the "Technogerma Mexico 1994" industrial fair, which 
was inaugurated by Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari 
on Monday.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the National Federation of Public </F>
Employees Unions, Fenasep, on the conflict between state workers 
and the government in Guatemala City on 23 February, read by 
unidentified Fenasep spokesman; from the "Telepress" newscast; 
broadcast in progress--recorded] 
  [Text] ...in keeping with its principles, values, and 
vocation of dialogue, as well as the use of reason and 
intelligence, and with the solidarity of independent unions 
represented by the Union of the Finance Ministry Employees, has 
investigated the real possibilities of achieving a decent wage 
increase, without affecting the rights and needs of private 
sector workers and the public in general. 
  2. With the investigation and drafted proposal, Fenasep and 
Sintrasip [expansion unknown] have initiated an honest, direct, 
open dialogue, a dialogue without giving up their principles 
with the government's economic cabinet. The results of this 
dialogue were reported to the unions' rank and file during 
special general assemblies. 
  3. Fenasep and Sintrasip announce to the country the 
government, via the economic cabinet, has not accepted salary 
adjustments, arguing it does not have the resources to do so. 
It has proposed to the Negotiating Commission an annual bonus 
of 360 quetzals, a proposal Fenasep and Sintrasip never accepted. 
  Consequently, by virtue of the moral authority vested upon 
the before mentioned unions, they reject the lies and false 
statements of those who have said these organizations are 
progovernment and have accepted the bonus. 
  4. The Fenasep rank and file, in a special general assembly, 
agreed to continue the talks to accomplish the following: 
  4.1. A salary adjustment in accordance with the high cost 
of living that will benefit not only state workers but also 
private sector workers. We also call for the implementation of 
other compensations to social sectors. 
  4.2. The government must demonstrate its political 
willingness and take corrective measures to guarantee a price 
reduction to the basic market basket items and must not permit 
increases to these products. The Economy, Finance, Energy and 
Mines, particularly, Ministries must stop protecting the 
interests of the large purse potentates; instead, they must 
impose price controls that guarantee the rights and interests of 
the poor majorities. 
  4.3. Fenasep and Sintrasip demand the Fiscal Offense Law 
be promulgated to punish those who evade taxes. Such a law must 
contemplate prison terms; that is, offenders must pay by 
spending time in prison, not with their dirty money, for the 
offense of tax evasion and nonpayment. 
  4.4. Fenasep and Sintrasip make a profound, serious, and 
responsible call to reflection and moderation to labor leaders. 
We must not play the game of those who want to blackmail us by 
privatizing state-owned companies. In addition, we demand the 
government rule out its plans to reduce the state via structural 
adjustment measures with the sale of assets and privatization of 
the basic services of Guatemalans. 
  4.5. Fenasep and Sintrasip affirm we must not give excuses 
to the sectors that are seeking to decree a state of emergency, 
which would be a return to the dictatorial-type measures of the 
past. We must avoid the working class again paying with its 
blood the price of recklessness, intolerance, and passion. 
  For a decent and fair salary for all and for the defense of 
national interests, 
  [Signed] Fenasep and Sintrasip

  [Text] This morning, some 4,000 public employees, members 
of the organization that groups state workers together, took 
part in a demonstration in western Guatemala. 
  Public employees from Huehuetenango, Quezaltenango, 
Totonicapan, San Marcos, and Solola also took part in the 
demonstration, which concluded with a meeting at a place called 
Cuatro Caminos. In this way, these state employees joined 
demonstrations staged in the capital yesterday to protest the 
government's refusal to grant a 40 percent salary increase. 
  According to local reports, traffic was interrupted on the 
Inter-American Highway for about two hours. The National Police 
dispatched officers to the site of the demonstration to 
guarantee public order along the highway.

  [Text] Bogota, 24 Feb (DPA) -- Today, Colombian Foreign 
Minister Noemi Sanin said it is unacceptable that Colombian 
citizen Maria Casas Dupuy, who was arrested in the United States 
on charges of espionage for the former USSR and Russia, has been 
both a diplomat and a CIA agent. This is the question that 
interests the Bogota government in the midst of the huge scandal 
that surrounds Washington and Moscow. Therefore, the Foreign 
Ministry has already asked the State Department to explain if 
Casas Dupuy worked for the CIA when she was the cultural attache 
of the Colombian embassy in Mexico. 
  Casas Dupuy, a 41-year-old intellectual, was arrested this 
week in the United States with her husband, Aldrich Hazan Ames, 
a high-ranking officer of the CIA, who is accused of selling 
secret information to the former USSR and then to Russia since 
1985. Sanin said the Colombian Government cannot condemn the 
former diplomat until U.S. authorities clarify this question. 
She also warned that many times people accused of certain crimes 
turn out to be innocent. 
  According to the Foreign Ministry, Casas Dupuy held the post 
in Mexico from April 1982 to December 1983, which means she 
would have been playing the double role of a CIA agent and a 
member of the diplomatic corps. According to FBI documents, the 
woman has worked for the intelligence corps since 1982. 
According to Gustavo de Greiff, prosecutor general of the 
Republic, if it is proven that Ames' wife was a CIA agent and a 
Colombian diplomat at the same time, she would be charged with 
treason to the fatherland. 
  In addition to clarifying the functions the woman had in the 
CIA, the Colombian Government has also asked Washington to 
explain what was the purpose of Ames' visit to Bogota on 30 
October to 3 November 1993, when he apparently met with Russian 
Secret Service agents. 
  One of the clues the United States used to capture the 
Ames-Casas couple was an ad published by THE WASHINGTON TIMES 
last October that said "we are ready to meet in the city you 
know well." According to investigations, that city would be 
Bogota. 
  The arrest of Casas Dupuy surprised everyone in Colombia, 
inasmuch as her friends remember her as a brilliant person who 
never showed any political inclinations. The woman, accused of 
espionage, graduated from the School of Philosophy and Letters 
of the University of the Andes in Bogota, and she has written 
poetry and philosophical essays.

Orejuela will not be released as was thought. The Cali regional 
prosecutor's office has issued a warrant for his arrest. 
  "National" newscast established, through high-level sources 
within the Dijin [Judicial Police and Investigations 
Directorate], that an arrest warrant was issued yesterday by the 
Cali regional prosecutor's office against Jaime Orejuela 
Caballero for the illegal possession of weapons. Also, the 
Bogota regional prosecutor's office has another preliminary 
investigation under way for illegal profiteering. 
  With the Cali arrest warrant, Orejuela Caballero will be 
unable to gain his freedom or be extradited to the United 
States, where he is sought for his role in cocaine production, 
possession, and distribution. In addition, the Colombian 
Constitution forbids the extradition of native-born Colombian 
citizens. 
  The DEA has also reported that Orejuela Caballero was 
involved in the murder of his former wife, and he is under 
investigation for his role in counterfeiting and arms 
trafficking to Colombia.

<F P=106> [Article by Julian Rios Rojas: "Second Round Against </F>
Cartels"] 
  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota--The death of the drug trafficker 
Pablo Escobar Gaviria marked the beginning of a new battle in 
Colombia: putting an end to the Cali Cartel. 
  According to the international police forces, the proof that 
the organization started coming under attack this year is shown 
in the results of recent operations that have made it possible 
to seize abroad gigantic cocaine shipments originating with the 
Cali Cartel. 
  In Colombia, the Counternarcotics Police and the state's 
intelligence and security agencies also have set out to battle 
that group head-on, because, according to a high-ranking 
official of the institution, "Now, there will be more time to 
fight it." 
  The authorities prepared a study on the organization's 
modus operandi, in order to learn the systems for 
trafficking with the alkaloid, as well as its production and the 
processing sites. 
  EL ESPECTADOR had access to several intelligence analyses 
that, surprisingly, reveal that the Cali drug traffickers 
control 80 percent of the cocaine shipped abroad. 
  The reports demonstrate that the Cali Cartel specializes in 
coca growing and production, and, finally, its crystallization. 
According to the documents, that cartel was formerly purchasing 
basic cocaine paste in Peru and Bolivia but, for the past 
several years, has been producing its own coca. 
  These reports reveal that, in view of the offensive 
conducted 
by the Counternarcotics Police against the drug trafficking 
ring, the latter decided to transfer its laboratories and some 
of its members to Ecuador, Venezuela, and Brazil. 
  The police official queried claimed: "Ecuador has become a 
bridge for the Cali Cartel. Impressive amounts of the drugs 
confiscated have come from that country." 
  This statement corroborates the results of some operations 
against the international rings in which cocaine shipments 
loaded in Ecuadoran ports have been seized. 
  This year the most severe blow dealt to the Cali Cartel by 
the police forces of Colombia, Italy, and the United Kingdom was 
operation "Angelo II." In this operation, after extensive 
intelligence work lasting over four months, a cocaine shipment 
that had departed from Ecuador was discovered. 
  Ten persons were captured, including some of the principal 
liaisons in Colombia and abroad. The Counternarcotics Police 
director, Colonel Teodoro Campo Gomez, returned from Italy this 
weekend, and will submit a detailed report on the operation. 
<H5>  In Venezuela as Well </H5>
  Moreover, the drug traffickers have crossed the 
Colombian-Venezuelan border, engaging in their illicit 
activities from several of that country's jungle sites. 
  One of those Venezuelan locales discovered by the Colombian 
police is the site known as Puerto Ayacucho, where the Cali 
cartel is growing and processing coca for subsequent shipment to 
Europe. 
  The police reports indicate that Brazil has become another 
strategic point for the Cali Cartel. Its members are producing 
large volumes of cocaine there also. 
  Insofar as Colombia is concerned, only 5 percent of that 
drug 
is produced in Valle del Cauca; while 75 percent comes from the 
departments of Guaviare, Vichada, Vaupes, Meta, Casanare, Huila, 
Putumayo, Arauca, and Amazonas. Another large percentage is 
produced in Ecuador, Venezuela, and Brazil. 
  The reports note that, simultaneously with its cocaine 
trafficking, the Cali Cartel is laundering money in Argentina, 
Chile, and Panama. In this latter country, two business firms 
located in the Colon free trade zone are being investigated for 
laundering dollars on behalf of the Cali Cartel. 
  The investigators believe that, this year, the Cali Cartel 
will not be able to produce more than 20 percent of the cocaine. 
They claim that the operations being conducted are causing the 
members of that organization to tremble.

  [Text] President Carlos Menem, who is resting in Cartagena 
de Indias with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, said there is 
no subversion in Argentina and "what happened in Chiapas cannot 
happen in Argentina." 
  In an interview published today in the Spanish newspaper 
ABC, 
Menem said: "Some kind of subversion has taken place in 
Santiago del Estero, but measures were adopted and the incidents 
are being investigated." 
  "The problem in Chiapas is ethnic and religious, something 
that does not happen in Argentina. There is no possibility of 
subversion here," Menem said. 
  "The incidents in Santiago del Estero were motivated by 
infiltrators, which explains the statements made by Daniel 
Ortega a few days ago in Cuba, in which he vindicated the armed 
struggle and mentioned the events in Chiapas and Santiago del 
Estero as an example." 
  "If Daniel Ortega mentioned Santiago del Estero as an 
example, it is because people have been infiltrated there by 
these elements, death traffickers, because subversion is without 
doubt traffic in death." 
  When asked what the solution will be to the Aerolineas 
Argentinas conflict with Iberia [Airlines], Menem said: "If the 
problem is not solved by the day I arrive in Spain, of course we 
will talk about it with the Spanish Government." 
  He also added that "of course" the Argentine Government 
wants 
Spain to continue, through Iberia, its participation in 
Aerolineas. 
  "That is why we privatized the company. We are trying to 
transfer the shares the government has (43 percent) in 
Aerolineas. We will transfer 28 percent of the shares and keep 
15 percent," Menem said. 
  He added: "If it is possible to privatize all the shares we 
will do so, but meanwhile, since the adjudication of shares to 
Iberia, the transfer of shares represents a form of 
capitalization for the Spanish company, thereby allowing it to 
continue operating in a more positive and fluent manner."

  [Excerpt] President Carlos Menem has taken advantage of his 
official two-day visit to Colombia to confirm Argentina's 
support for President Gaviria in his bid for the post of OAS 
secretary general. He even had time to speak about his heart. 
  Argentine President Carlos Menem today gave President 
Gaviria 
a strong endorsement in his bid for the post of OAS secretary 
general. Menam also announced both presidents will seek the 
support of other countries. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Do you think the 
role President Gaviria will play at the OAS, if elected 
secretary general, will be a good one? 
  [Menem] He would be a good secretary general for many 
reasons. The OAS, under the leadership of President Gaviria, if 
he is indeed elected, can improve its work and performance. [end 
recording] 
  Carlos Menem went on to talk about more than the OAS. The 
Argentine president, who has generated many controversies over 
family scandals in his country, confirmed not only that his 
heart is good, but also that it is still beating. 
  [Begin recording] [Menem] Thank God, my heart is doing very 
well. 
  [Reporter] Are you in love or not? 
  [Menem] I thought you were asking about the clinical and 
medical condition of my heart. 
  [Reporter] I am asking about both. 
  [Menem] Well, my heart is doing fine in both senses. [end

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 24 Feb (EFE) -- Mines and Energy 
Minister Guido Alberto Nule Amin announced today that Colombia 
will sell 15,000-20,000 barrels of petroleum per day to Cuba. 
The high-ranking official, who returned from Havana today, said 
both governments are interested in beginning the transaction. 
Nule Amin also indicated that the first shipments of Colombian 
petroleum to the Caribbean island will be made some time between 
June and July. 
  "We expect to finalize some details, such as payment and 
timeframe formulas" very soon, Nule Amin said. The minister 
explained that "these will be direct sales," making it known 
that the transactions will not involve any type of compensation 
or barter mechanisms. Guido Nule Amin emphasized that during 
the negotiations it was made clear that Colombia is willing to 
sell petroleum to Cuba, but under the same "conditions that 
prevail on the international market." 
  The Colombian minister said Cuba currently consumes 
50,000-60,000 barrels of petroleum and that, according to what 
was agreed upon in Havana, Colombia will initially supply 
one-third of Cuba's fuel supply. Colombia produces 
approximately 420,000 barrels a day. It consumes half of that 
amount and exports the rest.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the Colombian elections 
scheduled for 8 May 1994: 
  New Democratic Force (NFD) presidential candidate Andres 
Pastrana Arango has vigorously defended Colombian coffee 
producers during a meeting with residents of Bolivar, Andes, and 
Tamesis Municipalities in Antioquia Department. Pastrana said, 
"We must remember that coffee producers have promoted 
development in areas where crops are grown, as well as 
throughout the country in general." He also told his audience 
that we "cannot turn our backs on them now." (Santa Fe de Bogota 
EL NUEVO SIGLO in Spanish 14 Feb 94 p 7A) 
  At a meeting in Teusaquillo neighborhood in Santa Fe de 
Bogota, Conservative presidential hopeful Rodrigo Marin Bernal 
criticized NFD candidate Andres Pastrana's government program as 
being very weak. Marin said that Pastrana's program either 
evades the most pressing issues or approaches them in an overly 
simplistic manner. In Marin's opinion, Pastrana's approach is so 
superficial that "it would have been better for him to remain 
silent." (Santa Fe de Bogota EL NUEVO SIGLO in Spanish 14 Feb 
94 p 6A) 
  The Conservative National Directorate has decided to join 
the 
support expressed by Alvaro Gomez and the National Salvation 
Movement (NSM) for Andres Pastrana's presidential candidacy. A 
member of the directorate praised Pastrana's government program 
because of its national -- as opposed to partisan -- scope. 
(Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 
0000 GMT 17 Feb 94) 
  Presidential hopeful Andres Pastrana says that some 
Conservatives are trying to trap his campaign into being 
essentially conservative, when in truth it is a national 
suprapartisan movement. On 19 February, Pastrana toured eight 
municipalities in Bolivar Department. During the tour, Pastrana 
said: "I have said throughout all of Colombia that we do not 
want threats, kidnappings, violence, or massacres. The 
Colombian people want to consolidate peace, and by way of peace, 
we can attain development and, through development, the 
well-being of all Colombians." During the tour, Pastrana urged 
guerrilla groups to lay down their weapons. (Santa Fe de Bogota 
Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 0130 GMT 20 Feb 94) 
  Conservative presidential hopeful Marin Bernal says he will 
continue campaigning for the presidency, adding that after 14 
March he will conduct a nationwide campaign called "The One Left 
Homeless by Alvarismo [Alvaro Gomez of the NSM] and Pastranismo 
[Andres Pastrana]," because he believes he has been sacrificed 
because of his differences with the Pastrana and Gomez camps. 
(Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol Network in Spanish 1200 
GMT 18 Feb 94) 
  A month before the Liberal Party's presidential candidate is 
scheduled to be officially nominated, Carlos Lemos and David 
Turbay have stepped up their campaigns. Lemos believes that a 
form of violence worse than guerrilla warfare is created when 
the state plunges the people into poverty. Lemos says, "We must 
pay greater attention to this type of violence, because it 
fosters greater instability; therefore, we must establish a 
dialogue with people who are out of work." Meanwhile, David 
Turbay insists he will be nominated as the party's candidate. 
He said, "Even without the blessing of those who think they own 
the country, I will win the elections. I will win with God's 
blessing alone." (Santa Fe de Bogota EL NUEVO SIGLO in Spanish 
14 Feb 94 p 6A) 
  Liberal Party member Carlos Lleras de la Fuente today 
officially announced he will seek the party's presidential 
nomination. He told President Gaviria, "I want to be president 
of Colombia, not vice president." (Santa Fe de Bogota 
Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 1730 GMT 18 Feb 94) 
  Liberal presidential hopeful Ernesto Samper has visited four 
municipalities in Santander Department to explain his economic 
program, which focuses on housing and special attention for 
women and peasants. He said: "I am going to return the Agrarian 
Bank to the peasants of Santander, and we are going to 
strengthen the national rehabilitation plan." (Santa Fe de 
Bogota Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 0130 GMT 20 Feb 
94) 
  Antonio Navarro Woff, presidential candidate of the 19 April 
Movement Democratic Alliance (AD/M-19), today commented on 
President Cesar Gaviria's bid to become secretary general of the 
OAS. During a campaign appearance, Navarro Wolf said, "It is 
essential for Gaviria to tell the people of Latin America 
whether, if elected to the post, he plans to serve Latin America 
or to serve the United States." (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 
1842 GMT 17 Feb 94) 
  AD/M-19 presidential candidate Navarro Wolff has said the 
party's leadership should be enhanced. He also said he fears 
that the party could disappear from the political landscape.

  [Text] It was reported a short while ago from Caulatu, 
Quilali, that an agreement has been reached between the 
government and the rebels. As a result of this agreement, 
Esteban, the brother of Jose Angel Talavera, a.k.a. El Chacal, 
head of the 3-80 Northern Front, demobilized. Another important 
result of this agreement is that 100 recontras will surrender on 
2 March, and the last man will surrender his arms no later than 
8 April. 
  The government has agreed to create a provisional 
demilitarized zone in Caulatu and El Zungano, Esteli, and 
provide food, clothing, and medicines to the rebels while they 
wait for the demobilization's deadline.

  [Text] After reaching important agreements with the 
Government of Nicaragua, the 3-80 Northern Front led by Jose 
Angel Talavera, alias El Chacal, on Thursday signed a document 
to demobilize its troops. 
  The agreements reached between the rebels and the 
government, 
through the mediation of the Catholic Church and the CIAV 
[International Commission of Support and Verification]-OAS, 
establish the following main points: progressive disarmament of 
the 3-80 troops between 2 March and 8 April, demilitarization of 
the area, and former recontras joining the command posts of 
police headquarters in the municipalities of Jinotega and Nueva 
Segovia. 
  Likewise, the document signed between the government and the 
rearmed rebels establishes various social and economic 
development programs in the area. The agreements were signed 
after nearly 6 hours of intense negotiations and several foiled 
attempts in recent days.

<F P=106> [Report by Noel Irias] </F>
  [Text] Larry Astorga, general coordinator of the JS 
[Sandinist Youth Movement] and Deputy Coordinator Violeta 
Delgado were unexpectedly fired Saturday during a JS National 
Council session by a margin of one vote. 
  Roger Grijalva, a JS leader from Masaya, said the decision 
was made because "there was an absolute void in the 
organization's national leadership; we were isolated." 
  Nevertheless, doubts immediately emerged concerning the 
political and legitimate validity of the decision. According to 
JS sources who were at the session, the questions that have been 
raised mainly involve the absence of two departmental 
delegations at the session, the close margin by which the 
dismissals were approved and the likelihood -- which has not yet 
been proven -- that votes were cast by activists who are not 
members of the organization. 
  Bayardo Arce, a member of the FSLN [Sandinist National 
Liberation Front] National Directorate, was quite surprised by 
the National Council's decision. Arce said he suggested that 
the plenum stop focusing on internal matters and discuss youth 
problems such as "the reversal of the revolution's achievements 
at high schools, growing drug addiction, and the Atlantic coast 
elections. I am going to inform the National Directorate so 
that through our Secretariat an investigation can be carried out 
to determine if the decision was legitimate and in accordance 
with FSLN and JS laws and regulations," Arce said. According to 
Arce, "the National Council should, at any rate, have held an 
extraordinary National Assembly to reach a decision." 
  The vote was sheltered by an article in the JS charter which 
gives the National Council the power to fire any leader. Of 86 
members who were present, 45 voted in favor of the dismissals. 
Grijalva, however, said the vote was 59 in favor and 23 against 
the dismissals. 
  Sandinist Assembly member Rafael Henriquez, who was invited 
to the session, questioned the propriety and validity of the 
mechanism used by the National Council. "I do not know for sure 
if the article calls for a qualified vote or if the Council has 
the power to fire leaders appointed by the National Assembly." 
  According to Maria Ramirez, a member of the Sandinist 
Assembly who was invited to the JS National Council session, 
"the problem is political. At any rate a decision like this 
should have been made by the National Assembly that elected 
them. The difference of two votes indicates a lack of consensus 
in the decision. Problems are not resolved this way." 
  According to Henriquez, "none of the arguments I heard 
constituted grounds for dismissal. The problems of the JS and 
its leadership are obvious and anyone who attempts to resolve 
them will encounter the same difficulties." Henriquez, a former 
leader of the JS and UNEN [National Union of Nicaraguan 
Students], said "there was an undeniable problem with the 
leadership of Astorga and Delgado, but it would be way too much 
to blame them for the organization's problems." 
  According to JS sources consulted by BARRICADA, the 
delegations from Rivas and Esteli did not attend the session and 
two other departmental delegations withdrew following the vote. 
"The delegations from Chontales and Chinandega did not protest 
or explicitly express opposition during their withdrawal, but 
their action was clearly a form of protest," the source said. 
  Grijalva argued that the delegations left for reasons of 
time. 
  One person who attended the meeting said "this had been 
brewing for months; it was a maneuver involving trends. The 
real problem is that Astorga and Delgado had not sided with any 
trend; they had their own perspective." 
  An FSLN source explained to BARRICADA that the crisis began 
in 1993 when the JS leadership in Managua, headed by Vladimr 
Soto, raised serious questions about the leadership of Astorga 
and Delgado and attempted to break away. "The National 
Directorate had to intervene and there was nothing the people in 
Managua could do but go back together." 
  According to our sources, JS leaders from Managua, Masaya, 
and Matagalpa led the vote in favor of the dismissals. 
  While preparations are made for the election of the 
organization's top leaders, the JS National Council has 
temporarily appointed a coordinating commission headed by 
Enrique Pilarte and formed by departmental secretaries Francisco 
Guzman and Roger Grijalva, with Gustavo Alegria as an adviser. 
  Astorga defeated Alegria in the JS directorate elections in 
1992.

<F P=106> [Article by Monica Baltodano] </F>
  [Text] The FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] must 
undergo transformations that will enable it to adapt its 
structure and workings to the new conditions under which it is 
called upon to operate. One move in this direction is 
represented by the bylaws that were approved at the 1991 
Congress (which are radically different from the ones under 
which we operated throughout the 1980's) and the adjustments 
that we must make without delay for this special session. 
  Yet the key question is not what structure we will create 
for 
ourselves but rather: Should the FSLN continue to be a 
revolutionary party or should we organize ourselves in keeping 
with the commonplace objectives and styles of power-hungry 
parties? We will find the answer mainly in the "Principles and 
Program of the FSLN," which will also be revised by the time of 
the May Congress, and the changes in the bylaws will be 
consistent with them. 
  If the FSLN reaffirms that it is a party whose focus is the 
Nation as a whole but that wages its battle mainly to further 
the interests of the have-nots, a party that seeks power to 
continue making changes that will democratize society not only 
politically but in an economic and social sense as well, then 
the bylaws must be consistent with this tenet. 
  The bylaws of domestic and foreign rightist parties are very 
similar. They are vote- and power-hungry parties that are 
designed to reach their operating peak during election 
campaigns, when the main goal is to parcel out seats and posts. 
As far as these parties are concerned, politics boils down to 
taking office, enjoying power, and promoting a few policies of 
social justice. 
  Revolutionary parties, in contrast, are designed to function 
at all times, because they must support the struggles and 
grievances of the people at all times. They have very clear 
missions between elections, whether they are in power or the 
opposition. In keeping with their principles, revolutionary 
parties base their strength on developing the awareness of the 
people, on which they must work all the time. They forge broad 
political alliances but do not thereby corrupt the struggles and 
objectives of the party in light of its allies. 
  If most Sandinists want the FSLN to remain a revolutionary 
party and, in particular, a true government option, it will have 
to adopt structures and workings that are consistent with its 
devotion to democracy and revolution. 
<H5>  Intensifying Democratization </H5>
  Consequently, I feel that we must steadfastly intensify the 
democratization begun in 1990. The name that the FSLN's 
executive leadership body ought to adopt is not a matter of 
principle (until now it has been called the National 
Directorate), although many comrades in the rank and file 
contend that there ought to be a radical change in personnel, 
while others feel that the historic name ought to be preserved. 
Nonetheless, regardless of the name, it is imperative that the 
leadership, like the Sandinist Assembly, be elected directly by 
the Congress. 
  The subordination of the executive body to the Sandinist 
Assembly is not merely an issue related to the bylaws. This 
structuralist approach is too simplistic. What we have here is a 
political problem that requires political answers. 
  I feel that we need an effective and, therefore, not very 
large executive leadership body that can coordinate efforts 
through the regional network and that has close ties to the 
social organizations. 
  I would like to see the creation of a body that coordinates 
departmental chiefs but that has well-defined functions and 
decisionmaking power on a number of issues affecting party life. 
  One of the most important and decisive issues is the rank 
and 
file bodies. I think that we must try to bring as many 
Sandinists as possible into the new organizations and to 
broaden, without factionalism, the political involvement of a 
wide range of sectors in all spheres of activity that Sandinism 
can create and support. We must recognize, however, that there 
are different levels of commitment in the FSLN, and therefore 
categories must be maintained, with the different demands 
clearly spelled out. 
  The suggestion about organizing the FSLN in an altogether 
liberal manner is typical of the vote-getting approach. If we 
want a party that brings together people who are ready to push a 
revolutionary agenda, then it must have discipline and teamwork. 
A revolutionary party cannot be organized as if it were a club 
without membership requirements, because even religious or 
humanitarian organizations have demands, discipline, and 
hierarchical categories, not to mention the capitalist business 
system, part of whose success is based on its organizational and 
hierarchical capacity. In a word, the oppressive system that we 
are combating is organized and cannot be defeated with a liberal 
approach. 
  Under these new conditions, leaders (the Sandinist Assembly, 
the executive leadership body, regional posts) must be elected 
individually, directly, and secretly from among candidates who 
offer political proposals, not just personal appeal. A code of 
ethics to govern procedures must be established. 
  A quota for women has been a long-standing grievance of the 
women's movement, and the party should establish one without 
delay. This will insure that women, of whom we see fewer and 
fewer in leadership posts and as public candidates, have a 
minimum of representation at all levels.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Sandinist Assembly Member Omar Cabezas: "My </F>
Position in the FSLN"] 
  [Text] I have never written in Sandinist newspapers or 
appeared on radio programs because for personal reasons I felt 
that after 25 February 1990 the controversy within our party 
and, in particular, the public controversy were being handled 
poorly. The debate in our organization was characterized by 
epithets, mutual disparagement, and too many subjective attacks. 
  I have also declined invitations to the legitimate 
gatherings 
of various groups and refused to sign their equally legitimate 
documents. 
  I have decided today to break my self-imposed public 
silence. 
I am doing so for a sound reason: so that all Sandinists, the 
people of Nicaragua, and perhaps those who know me outside the 
country can become familiar with my position. While not wishing 
to be immodest, I harbor the secret hope that my position is 
shared by most rank-and-file Sandinists, whether organized in 
party bodies or not, by countless mid-level officials, whether 
long-time or not, and even by our brothers who have quite 
rightly already taken a definite stand on the internal problems 
of the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front], which are 
reflected publicly in the disagreements between Daniel and 
Sergio. 
  I am not frightened by the democracy that has been 
developing 
in the FSLN because we all wanted it and were involved in it. I 
am not frightened by the lawful and legitimate meetings of 
various groups of Sandinists, whether they receive press 
coverage or not. I am not frightened by the disagreements within 
our party. They enrich us. They are a fact. We must acknowledge 
it. 
<H5>  A Poorly Handled Controversy </H5>
  I am concerned, however, about how this dispute is being 
handled. I think that the poor handling of this controversy in a 
young and poorly administered (understood) internal democracy 
could lead to a split in the FSLN. 
  Those who would like to eliminate us, even physically, and 
our political adversaries are fomenting division in our ranks. 
They go back and forth with gossip between Sandinists, telling 
one and all. Some of our brothers and, at times, some of our 
media echo this gossip, thus adding fuel to the fire, which our 
adversaries stoke. 
  Some brothers who have quite justifiably made a clear-cut 
commitment to one or another position do not always do the best 
job of conveying what is discussed at these meetings, whether 
they are official, unofficial, or even among Sandinist 
congressmen, to the National Directorate, to the rank and file, 
and to the mass media. 
  At this point in the discussion I have the impression that a 
few brothers who are coming together with legitimate excitement 
and enthusiasm around the various schools of thought concerning 
the "Program, Principles, and Bylaws" that the FSLN ought to 
have in the immediate future (which are the outcome of a dynamic 
discussion that has not always been sound and is at times far 
from ethical) have wound up describing the position of others 
with stereotypes and even in black-and-white terms. 
  I think that there are brothers in the two factions who are 
already almost seeing things in black and white and losing their 
objectivity. I am concerned that emotion and passion seem at 
times to outweigh calm analysis and caution. 
  When a public political debate lapses into denunciations, 
generally by those who disagree, and into the stigmatizing of 
the other, it not only causes confusion in the various bodies of 
organized or unorganized Sandinism but also helps to divide our 
organization in the most naive way (I choose not to think that 
the intentions are evil). 
<H5>  Struggling for Unity </H5>
  I have friends and brothers on both sides and I have been 
listening to them all carefully and respectfully. There is some 
truth to what they both say. I feel, think, see, sense, hear, 
and observe that there is some truth to both positions. My 
position right now, acknowledging that each side possesses some 
of the truth, is that we should discuss what is best in each in 
a more mature, ethical manner and that at the May Congress we 
should extract the truth of Sandinism, which is part of the 
country's truth, from all of these bits of truth and, in an 
exemplary fashion for Nicaragua and the world that will be 
watching us, put together a single program and set of bylaws. At 
that same Congress we should then select the best men and women 
to guide the crystallization of our integrated truth so that 
later, in 1995, we can begin to seek out, either by ourselves or 
with other parties if appropriate, the brothers and sisters who 
are best suited to be our candidates in the 1995 elections. 
  In conclusion, I would like to point out a few things: 
  1. I think that along with discussing our internal problems 
we ought to see to it that the government, the IMF, and the 
World Bank do not condemn us to a return to the Stone Age with 
their cruel economic policies that are causing so much suffering 
and destabilization and that are introducing elements of anarchy 
into Nicaraguan society. 
  2. Today I am also sending a private letter to the National 
Directorate, expressing these same concerns. 
  3. Besides wanting to do something for Leon, Nicaragua, and 
the FSLN, I am, like any professional, trying to advance in my 
career as an attorney so that I can provide for my family's 
future, inasmuch as I will not seek reelection as a deputy or to 
run for mayor, nor do I seek any leadership post in our 
organization. 
  Although some comrades do not realize this clearly, I am 
simply trying to do what we did in 1976 or 1977, when on Kilambe 
Hill, 1,750 meters above sea level, cold and hungry, Camilo 
Ortega and I struggled from the two factions to which we 
belonged to unite the FSLN and defeat the dictatorship. Camilo 
and I made our little contribution to that heroic feat. 
  My father and three brothers who died in the struggle 
against 
the dictatorship, the thousands of Nicaraguans who fell before 
and after we took power, our accomplishments (some important 
ones still survive), and the accomplishments to come demand of 
me and demand of us all that we fight for party unity. If this 
letter succeeds in making a little contribution in this 
direction, I think that it will have achieved its goal.

<F P=106> [Commentary by FSLN Militant Carlos J. Vegacruz] </F>
  [Text] I would like to contribute to the debate inside the 
FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front]. I will put forth 
several ideas in this connection. 
  The FSLN is not the personal property of any leader. The 
FSLN 
is not the private property of any member of the National 
Directorate or of any Sandinist activist. Therefore, no one can 
claim to own the FSLN. In reality, however, we can see and show 
that Daniel, our national coordinator, appears to be the lord 
and master of the FSLN, or is made to so appear. I do not deny 
Daniel's major historic merits, but they do not mean that he is 
the most able or the only leader of the Sandinist Party. 
  The times in which we live demand that we be consistent with 
the Dialectic. If we remain bogged down in internal political 
changes, the social dynamic will wipe us off the political map. 
The FSLN must continue to move forward with its democratization 
in order to be able to democratize society. This means that our 
main leaders, at every level of the party, must be agents of 
change, leaders who are in tune with the democratic winds that 
are blowing through the ranks of the FSLN and all over the world. 
  We must promote change in the styles and methods of the 
Directorate, in the leadership, in our organizational structure. 
Therefore, we must be flexible yet firm, self-critical, and 
humble. We must struggle in a public-spirited manner together 
with our people for peace and for life. We must seek ways of 
erasing our party's militaristic image from the minds of the 
people. Our leaders must be peace-loving, intelligent people of 
progress who possess true social sensitivity and are not 
demagogues. Our leaders must be and have the reputation of being 
honest and must be respected by Sandinists and non-Sandinists 
alike, because when we return to power in the next elections, we 
are going to govern for the progress of the entire nation. 
  The essence of the FSLN is its democratic spirit. We want to 
democratize Nicaraguan society. We tried to do so during the 
revolutionary government through agrarian reform, education, and 
the single health-care system, but we did not progress to the 
internal running of the FSLN. The methods of the historic 
National Directorate did not permit this, perhaps owing to the 
influence of its underground past, and they justified these 
methods by citing outside aggression. Today, however, the 
democratic spirit of Sandino must once again take hold of the 
minds and deeds of Sandinists. We must not allow creativity, 
freedom of individual thought, and collective consensus to be 
crushed. The democratization of the FSLN begins with respect for 
individuals and with not allowing people who seem to be one 
thing but who are quite the opposite to impose their unhealthy 
wills. 
  The FSLN is opposed to dictatorship on principle. The FSLN 
emerged as the antithesis of Somoza's dictatorial system. A 
dictatorship is, in essence, the antithesis of democracy. Thus, 
dictatorship means imposition, a top-down hierarchy, arrogance, 
autocracy, violence, terror. This is why we in the FSLN must 
never allow any trace of dictatorship. On the contrary, all 
activists and the people must have confidence that our beliefs, 
our judgments, and our right to elect and be elected 
democratically are respected. Let us not allow leaders to be 
imposed on us. 
  Let us democratize the FSLN. Let us bring in people who 
think 
and act democratically, leaders who have done a great deal for 
the party and the people and who have not made it a point to 
maintain their idolized image. Leaders who are in the vanguard 
of thinking, who look to the future, not to the past of 
violence. Leaders who think about a new Nicaragua. Leaders like 
Dr. Sergio Ramirez Mercado, who has worked without political 
propaganda, who has not availed himself of the FSLN's resources 
to cultivate his image. He shines with his own light. 
  We Sandinists are thinking beings. The people are wise; they 
know how to distinguish what is good; a people who want a better 
future, a future of peace and of harmony. 
  Carlos J. Vegacruz B.

  [Excerpt] Tavapy 1, Alto Parana -- The police reacted 
violently against the some 400 peasants from Tavapy 1 and 2 who 
partially occupied Route No. 6, nearby km 22, for a short while 
in protest over the serious economic hardships they are 
experiencing and to demand at least 1,000 Guaranies per kilogram 
of cotton. 
  Almost 100 people were injured as a result of the police 
repression. One person was seriously injured by a tear gas 
canister. 
  The long history of struggle by Tavapy peasants was revived 
yesterday when about 400 of them temporarily occupied the road 
despite a strong police contingent. They refused to withdraw 
and sustained beatings and were the target of tear gas. [passage

  [Excerpt] Rodolfo Friedmann, the former governor of Guaira 
Department, has sought asylum at the Spanish Embassy because he 
has received death threats. However, because there is no asylum 
treaty between Spain and Paraguay, Friedmann was unable to 
achieve his goal. Nevertheless, Spanish Ambassador Asuncion 
Anzorena put Friedmann into contact with Interior Minister 
Carlos Podesta, who offered him the necessary guarantees and 
placed a police guard at his disposal. Friedmann also made 
serious charges against President Juan Carlos Wasmosy and 
Senator Juan Carlos Galaverna. 
  Former Guaira Governor Rodolfo Friedmann yesterday reported 
that during the evening of 21 February three armed individuals 
who got out of a Santana at the corner of Republica Argentina 
and Espana Avenues made death threats against him, his wife, and 
his children. 
  Friedmann added that he was warned that if he did not 
withdraw all charges made against the president in view of the 
decree accepting his resignation, his wife and children would 
suffer the consequences. 
  In view of this incident, Friedmann tried to seek asylum at 
the Spanish Embassy to protect himself. He added that because 
there is no asylum treaty between Spain and Paraguay, the 
Spanish ambassador put him in contact with Interior Minister 
Carlos Podesta. 
  According to Friedmann, Podesta offered him the necessary 
guarantees. This was evidenced yesterday afternoon, when 
Friedmann received police custody. 
  Friedmann added that after having held a telephone 
conversation with the Spanish ambassador he again received death 
threats, warning him that the action was to be perpetrated 
yesterday. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Paraguayan Episcopal Conference, presided over 
by Monsignor Oscar Paez Garcete, issued a note addressed to 
civilian authorities and political, social, peasant, and 
workers' leaders urging them to seek appropriate ways to find 
just solutions to the grave social problems affecting our 
country. 
  According to the bishops, dialogue is the most important 
tool 
for understanding because it will lead to a better 
interpretation of people's needs "because we know that 
radicalized positions of opposing interests always lead to 
violent confrontations and will increasingly deteriorate our 
fragile democratic coexistence." 
  The note says that the best efforts must be made to acquire 
and develop attitudes and actions seeking the moral cleansing of 
our institutions, companies, and individual behavior. 
  The note also says that institutions and state powers must 
have a quota of power and responsibility to be able to seek, 
promote, and administer the common good in democratic ways, and 
particularly respecting the poor. 
  "An adequate economic order requires a permanent review in 
accordance with dynamic criteria of social justice. Everyone, 
and particularly Christians, in labor as well as managerial 
leadership positions must have a deep and clear view of our 
common good. This is the best tool for fighting the corruption 
that corrodes democratic ideals and hinders social and human 
progress," the Paraguayan bishops' letter says. 
  The document adds that the problems now surfacing in diverse 
demonstrations have been there for a long time: land needs, 
better prices for agricultural products, and better salaries. 
These problems are not isolated or circumstantial, but they 
affect the entire country. This means that solutions have not 
yet been proposed for these problems, which grow worse every day 
and risk producing a generalized social outburst. 
  The document says that the much-yearned-for democratic 
political institutions, which have been in place for some years, 
cannot offer a satisfactory answer on their own to the needs of 
the poorest sectors of the population in order to achieve social 
coexistence and the enjoyment of an authentic peace. 
  It is therefore evident that state institutions have a 
special responsibility to promote immediate initiatives seeking 
just solutions to these problems, something that cannot continue 
to be postponed. 
  "As believers, we must look at these problems through God's 
eyes and understand them according to the wishes of our merciful 
father," the note adds. 
  The bishops conclude by exhorting people to trust and pray, 
knowing that the light we need to act according to God's wishes 
comes from Him, who is a father full of mercy.

  [Excerpt] So far it is a rumor: Colonel German Linares may 
be appointed police attache to the Bolivian Embassy in 
Washington. The Bolivian Foreign Ministry has not confirmed this 
rumor. Anyway, Linares cannot be appointed as attache until his 
pending trial is resolved in Bolivia. The facts were made public 
thanks to Senator Andres Solis Rada. 
  Ten years ago, in 1984, a lawsuit was filed against a long 
list of individuals accused of being involved in the kidnapping 
of the then-president of the Republic, Hernan Siles Suazo. The 
name of Col. German Linares is on the list and he is allegedly 
one of the main individuals responsible for that criminal action 
and the coup attempt. However, the trial was paralyzed a long 
time like many other lawsuits that sleep in the courtrooms of 
our country. 
  Solis Rada, alarmed at the possibility that Linares might be 
appointed to a diplomatic post, remembered the case and asked 
District Attorney Javier Dipps to reactivate the trial. 
Therefore, this not only means that Col. Linares cannot be a 
diplomat, but he cannot even leave the country. [passage omitted]

  [Text] MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left] Deputy 
Sergio Medinacelli, CONDEPA [Conscience of the Fatherland] 
Deputy Eduardo Paz, and ADN [Nationalist Democratic Action] 
Senator Jorge Landivar believe the new U.S. antidrug strategy, 
escalating the drug enforcement in the producing countries, will 
entail social problems. Therefore, their initial reaction was to 
reject transferring the "dirty war" to Bolivia. 
  In this regard, the three opposition congressmen lashed out 
at the fact that Bill Clinton's administration has decided to 
give more attention to its "domestic policy," leaving the 
producing countries at the mercy of clashes between drug 
traffickers and antidrug forces that, more often than not, kill 
peasants and not the criminals deeply involved in drug 
trafficking activities. 
  Landivar exclaimed: "We will not allow our country to become 
another Colombia." Paz pointed out: "A bloodbath involving 
innocent people will be the result of an antidrug war." 
Medinacelli stressed: "We cannot pay for Clinton's pragmatism." 
<H5>  Like the Industrial Field </H5>
  Medinacelli compared the U.S. decision with a situation that 
arose a few years ago in the industrial field when the United 
States purchased mineral complexes from Bolivia and paid for tin 
alone. Nevertheless, when the United States realized that 
refining tin damaged the U.S. environment, it preferred the 
refining to be carried out in our country. 
  The MIR congressman added: "The same happens with drug 
trafficking. First, the United States waged a cruel war against 
drug trafficking in which even politicians were involved, and 
now it wants this dirty war to be waged outside U.S. territory." 
<H5>  The Armed Forces Will Not Join the War </H5>
  After pointing out that the U.S. contribution always 
involved 
interdiction, with its consequences of violence and death, Paz 
ruled out the possibility that the Armed Forces might join the 
struggle against drug trafficking because in the past few years 
the Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) has managed to 
accumulate more "firepower" than the Bolivian Army. 
  The CONDEPA deputy noted: "The U.S. decision will promote an 
antinational discussion on the viability of alternative 
development in our country." 
<H5>  He Is Not Acquainted With Latin America </H5>
  For his part, Landivar said Clinton's decision seems to be a 
result of his unawareness of the positive results yielded by 
alternative development in the Latin American countries. 
  In Bolivia, Landivar said, the Repentance Decree was the 
outcome of the social isolation to which the drug traffickers 
have been exposed through well-developed consciousness-raising 
campaigns.

  [Text] Cochabamba -- Some 50,000 coca growers affiliated 
with the five coca growers federations of this department have 
been told to fight the imminent compulsory coca eradication that 
has generated a strained atmosphere in this tropical zone. 
  According to information obtained, the government has 
instructed the National Coca Control Directorate (DINACO) and 
the Coca Eradication Directorate (DIRECO) to fulfill the plan to 
eradicate all surplus coca plantations by 31 March "with or 
without dialogue." 
  Jorge Martinez, coordinator of the five federations, voiced 
his "deep concern" over the fact that government authorities 
"have given this order but they do not want to dialogue because 
since January they have repeatedly suspended scheduled meetings. 
They promised an answer in writing but have failed to give it." 
  Martinez asserted: "We are certain that the government is 
seeking to justify the compulsory eradication of coca 
plantations." He said that in view of this, the latest 
emergency meeting held in Ivirgazama decided to declare coca 
growers in state of alert and mobilization. 
  He added: "We are organized," adding that the committees for 
the defense of coca leaf production in labor organizations and 
unions "are already alert." He said they have decided to 
suspend the voluntary eradication "in response to the 
government's lack of interest." 
  The leader added that "although the government is making fun 
of us" they will wait until 16 February for the announced 
meeting to take place, even though DIRECO "constantly threatens 
and pressures us." 
  Martinez charges that members of the Victor Ustariz Regiment 
and of the Special Forces Training Center (CITE) will enter the 
tropical zone to carry out maneuvers, but they believe "it is 
part of the plan to use force to eradicate the coca plantations." 
  In face of this, he warned that coca growers will begin a 
hunger strike because they do not have the means to face the 
military men. He added: "There is a very tense atmosphere, there 
is fear that clashes will take place. This is, seemingly, what 
the gringos want to justify the intervention." 
  Martinez recalled that coca growers proposed amending 
Supreme 
Decree No. 23668 which eliminated the participation of the 
peasants as established by Supreme Decree No. 22270. "Now the 
government ministry is in charge of promoting development in 
Chapare and this is not right. We have made concrete proposals 
but have not received any answer." 
  Martinez added that if the authorities in charge of handling 
coca producer affairs do not answer, they will request an 
audience with the president of the Republic to whom they will 
explain their problems "within the framework of the people's 
participation plan he always talks about."

  [Text] "Faced with a governmental onslaught," the 
Federation of Tropical Carrasco Settlers [Federacion de 
Colonizadores de Carrasco Tropical] is reorganizing the coca 
defense committees and has proposed "Option One" ["Opcion Uno"] 
-- the expulsion of the DEA -- to counter the government's 
"Option Zero" ["Opcion Cero"] which involves a massive reduction 
of our country's coca crops. 
  The communique was released following the government's 
decision to forcefully reduce all coca crops in the Chapare 
region and to mobilize Coca Reduction Directorate (DIRECO) 
agents who "intimidate and threaten our rank-and-file comrades, 
forcing them to reduce their coca crops." 
  In response to the government's "Option Zero" -- which 
involves the eradication of our coca crops as a way of drug 
enforcement -- the Federation of Tropical Carrasco Settlers 
proposes "Option One" -- the expulsion of DEA officials from our 
country -- "to reassert our national sovereignty." 
  The eight-point communique released yesterday, after the 
government again suspended a meeting scheduled to discuss coca 
problems, instructs federation members to nationally and 
regionally reorganize coca defense committees, which comprise 
all existing institutions and organizations. 
  In a serious warning, which seems like an imposition, the 
federation members call citizens' committees of the tropical 
region and mayors' offices to support the coca growers' struggle. 
  The communique notes: "If they refuse, the coca producers 
will intervene in these institutions." 
  The coca growers communique states: "Reject any governmental 
attempt to carry out a forceful reduction of coca crops." The 
communique also declares "a state of emergency and constant 
mobilization of our federation's ranks, and a suspension of the 
voluntary reduction of our coca crops until the government 
implements development projects." 
  The coordinating committee of the five coca growers 
federations also proposes "calling a protest rally in the town 
of Ivirgarzama as soon as possible." 
  The communique concludes by stating: "Faced with the 
government's Option Zero -- which involves the complete removal 
of coca in the tropical region -- we propose Option One, 
involving the DEA's expulsion from our national territory."

  [Excerpt] Drug Prevention and Social Rehabilitation Under 
Secretary Jose Luis Harb yesterday disclosed that the Bolivian 
and Chilean governments have agreed to unify their policies to 
prevent drug consumption in the high risk regions in both 
countries. 
  The plan is to establish control, education, and health 
promotion policies, as well as to work on drug prevention 
programs and the struggle against drug trafficking, as part of a 
plan to change the antinarcotics strategy. 
  In Jose Luis Harb's opinion, the most important achievements 
in international negotiations were those reached with the 
Chilean Government. 
  He asserted: "Important agreements have been reached for the 
establishment of common and reciprocal actions in the 
interdiction field, and for the exchange of information on the 
border control and particularly on illegal precursors smuggled 
into the country." 
  The "narco-influence" ["narco-influencia"] phenomenon, which 
the government has identified as the "number one" threat to 
youths in Bolivian territory, has increased the level of drug 
consumption in the country to 2 percent of the Bolivian 
population. 
  According to a study conducted by the Drug Prevention and 
Social Rehabilitation Undersecretariat, "narco-influence" has 
become the main concern of the Government Ministry due to 
Bolivia's character as a drug producer and generator of cocaine 
trafficking to the rest of the world. 
  Jose Luis Harb commented: "Most youths start off by getting 
involved in drug production, then in drug trafficking, and they 
end up becoming highly addicted." 
  This is how the "narco-influence" phenomenon is generated in 
Bolivia, although he did not mention the true origin of "the 
youths' involvement in the underworld." [passage omitted]

  [Text] The following is a report from the Social 
Communications Ministry: 
  Last night, in the main hall of Government House, President 
Gonzalo Sanchez de Losada presented the Popular Participation 
Law to the nation. He did so on a national radio and television 
network in the presence of an audience of guests specially 
invited by a [word indistinct] polling company for a question 
and answer session. 
  As is his custom, the president presented the law during a 
frank dialogue with the Bolivian people and explained the scope 
and benefits this law will bring to all municipalities, 
communities, and cantons. 
  [Words indistinct] of the law, he said that it promotes and 
consolidates popular participation by incorporating Indian, 
peasant, urban, and rural communities in the political and 
economic life of the country. This law will likewise improve the 
lives of Bolivian men and women with a fairer distribution of 
wealth and better administration of public funds. It will 
strengthen the political and economic instruments necessary to 
improve democracy and will facilitate and make the participation 
of the people possible. [recorded passage indistinct]

  [Excerpt] Labor Minister Reynaldo Peters accused the 
Bolivian Labor Federation [COB] of intending to carry out 
actions to place the governability and stability of the Bolivian 
state at risk with its intransigence and refusal to discuss the 
economic and social measures implemented by the government. 
  Peters made this statement a few hours after several 
professional and labor organizations adopted radical pressure 
measures against the government, rejecting the capitalization of 
public enterprises, the reform of the social security and 
education system, and a wage increase of only 7.5 percent. 
  "None of the strikes announced in the past few hours were 
legally notified according to the Labor Law," Peters said. He 
added that the Bolivian Medical Association, which will hold a 
48-hour strike, and energy and telephone company workers, who 
will hold a 24-hour strike, "have not made any economic demand 
at all." 
  He said he ordered measures to punish those who do not go to 
work, adding that strikes by service sector workers were 
declared illegal. 
  The labor minister regretted that the Bolivian labor 
organizations have adopted "a frank and offensive attitude of 
incomprehension toward the government and its policy." 
  He said this "labor intransigence does not reflect the will 
of the Bolivian people or workers; it is a political position of 
the labor chiefs." 
  "Feeling relegated from the labor organization as a result 
of 
the measures announced by the government, these union leaders 
are making an effort to attain a more prominent position at any 
price," the minister said. 
  Peters said that is the position assumed by the COB 
leadership, especially since the COB will hold a congress in May. 
  "Such is the real spirit behind the labor strikes and 
mobilizations that are planned in the whole country," Peters 
said. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Potosi correspondent Mario Mamani Morales] </F>
  [Text] 14 February -- When assuming office as the new 
national leader of the General Trade Union Confederation of 
Bolivian Peasant Workers [CSTUCB], Felix Santos Zambrana 
emphatically said: "We are going to launch a strong offensive 
against small estates [as published] in Bolivia so that lands 
may revert to their original owners -- the peasantry." Santos 
was elected CSTUCB leader during a convention held in Cochabamba. 
  The new leader stated that the problem of land will be one 
of 
his overriding concerns as CSTUCB leader. 
  According to data provided by this trade union, there are 
approximately 36 million hectares of arable land in Bolivia, of 
which only 4 million are owned by true peasants; the remaining 
32 million hectares have been given away to the big landowners 
or large estate owners, especially in the departments of Pando, 
Beni, and Santa Cruz. 
  With regard to this issue, Santos explained that "there are, 
however, 3 million of us peasants who are affiliated with the 
CSTUCB, and who are demanding that we be given lands so as to be 
able to eke out a living. We are not asking for a present, but 
rather to be given back what has always belonged to us." 
  While a few big landowners have control of most of the land 
in Bolivia, more than a million Bolivian peasants are tilling 
others' lands in Argentina and Chile. "Need has led them to 
grovel for a job in other nations, which they enrich because 
they have no future in the land of their forefathers." 
  According to Santos, an average of 45 Bolivians emigrate to 
Argentina every day from Potosi Department alone. Even though 
most of them are illiterate peasants, they are skillful 
agricultural workers. Argentine ranchers are thus exploiting 
this situation to their own advantage. 
  Santos stated that in order to put an end to this situation, 
the CSTUCB will further a policy of dialogue with the government 
so as to effect a land reform that will enable thousands of 
peasants to settle in lands located in eastern Bolivia, where 
there are projects under way providing technical, agricultural, 
health, and education support. 
  "If they do not pay heed to our demands, we will then be 
forced to invade the land given out to big landowners, who 
moreover do not cultivate it," he asserted. 
  According to Santos, Law 1008 is an enemy to coca growers 
but 
not to drug traffickers. "Peasants are maltreated, persecuted, 
killed, their homes are burned down, their organizations are 
intervened with, while drug traffickers themselves go 
unscathed," he says. 
  He contends that the jails are packed with peasants who have 
been driven by hunger to engage in processing drugs, whereas 
wealthy drug kingpins who bribe authorities never have to go 
through difficult moments if they are ever caught. 
  Santos is of the opinion that "coca ought to be processed 
and 
exported, whether as pharmaceutical products or for other 
legally accepted uses, and for these drugs Bolivia should get 
export earnings that favor peasants through legal channels." 
  This is the first time in 17 years that CSUTCB has entrusted 
its leadership to a Quechua Indian. 
  The CSUTCB was established on 26 June 1979, and has been 
headed by Aymara leaders from La Paz Department for 14 years. 
Only once was it headed by an Aymara from Oruro City (Juan de 
la Cruz Villca). Chapaco, Camba, and Quechua Indians have never 
had a seat in the union's executive board. 
  Santos advocates that his new management strategy will seek 
to "be the bulwark of a multicultural Bolivian state, which we 
will seek to establish through the integration and strengthening 
of Aymara, Guarani, Chapaco, Camba, and Quechua Indian cultures." 
  He told LA RAZON that the "military-peasant pact" made with 
the help of civilians during the past military regimes was a red 
herring to carve up the land, "but the time has come for us to 
struggle to have our grievances met once and for all." 
  The multicultural state that he proposes will consist of 
achieving the full representation for all nationalities existing 
in Bolivian territory, through the establishment of "Assemblies 
of Nationalities" first, and then of a great peasant 
organization. 
  Santos stated that "there are qualified people among us 
peasants. We have become aware of the reality that involves 500 
years of exploitation and pillage of our natural resources, our 
lands, and we have decided that we have had enough of so much 
humiliation."

  [Text] The Social Emergency Fund [FSE] -- which is 
considered essential for the success of the economic plan of 
Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso -- will most probably 
be promulgated this week. Congress approved the FSE with just 
one change. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter Luciane Bacellar from Brasilia] 
The FSE was approved by 402 votes of the 500 congressmen present 
for the voting. Only one change was made: The government lost 
its power to reduce the bank PIS [Social Integration Program] 
contribution. 
  Congress approved the FSE but it has yet to decide whether 
to 
implement it immediately. The voting may take place this 
afternoon. The administration needs 293 votes to implement the 
FSE immediately. The date of the session at which the bill will 
be promulgated will be decided later. Only then will the FSE be 
implemented and will Minister Cardoso go ahead with the second 
phase of his economic plan: the Real Value Unit, URV. 
  [Senate Speaker Humberto Lucena] Congress must first 
conclude 
its work so that the minister can do his part. If the amendment 
is approved we will immediately call a session to promulgate it 
because it must be promulgated at a plenary meeting. [end

  [Text] The decision has been made: Now that Congress has 
approved the Social Emergency Fund [FSE], the economy's new 
leading index will go into effect early next week. Finance 
Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso today explained that the Real 
Value Unit [URV] will be adjusted for 100 percent of inflation. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter Ana Paula Padrao from Brasilia] 
The minister was very pleased that Congress had voted for the 
FSE; it put him in a very good mood. On his way to work this 
morning, he stopped to purchase newspapers, and briefly refuted 
the more sensationalist headlines. He promised: Nobody has to 
rush to the banks to take out their money, because the new 
economic plan does not change anything in the lives of the 
workers. He confirmed that the provisional measure establishing 
the URV will be issued on 28 February, adding that he is not 
worried by the coincidence that the Cruzado Plan had been 
launched on the same date. The Cruzado Plan was a good economic 
plan, Cardoso said, adding that a lot has been learned in the 
meantime, and the new plan will be successful. 
  The minister stated that measures designed to punish 
companies which increase their prices outrageously are being 
studied. Cardoso confirmed, however, that the policy of the 
economic team is to adjust salaries according to the inflation 
average and keep prices free. From his point of view this is to 
the workers' advantage. He explained that those whose salaries 
are stated in URV will be protected. Once the URV is 
implemented, salaries will not stay behind inflation for a 
single day. 
  [Cardoso] The wages of workers who get paid by the day will 
be adjusted practically every day. Those who get paid by the 
week will have their wages adjusted throughout the week, and 
those who get paid by the month will have their wages adjusted 
throughout the month. That is not the case now, because wages 
are adjusted for only 90 percent of inflation three months out 
of four, and only on the fourth month are the workers' wages 
adjusted for 100 percent of inflation. It will be different 
from now on: Wages will be adjusted for 100 percent of 
inflation throughout the month. 
  [Padrao] Once salaries are adjusted for the average 
inflation 
through the URV mechanism, what will happen to prices? 
Everybody is worried because prices will not follow the same 
approach. 
  [Cardoso] The less prices follow the same approach the 
better 
for the salaried workers, because the value of their income will 
be guranteed while prices will have no adjustment reference. 
Therefore, the longer businessmen take to adjust their prices 
through the URV mechanism, the better for the workers. [end

  [Text] Brasilia -- Industry, Commerce, and Tourism Minister 
Elcio Alvares estimates that the draft patent law, which will 
regulate the protection of industrial property in the country, 
will not be voted on by Congress until the second half of 1994. 
The United States is threatening to impose trade sanctions on 
Brazil if measures designed to protect industrial property are 
not approved by 28 February. 
  The Brazilian Government is seeking to avert U.S. 
retaliatory 
measures by proposing amendments to the draft patent law, which 
has been sitting in the Senate for eight months. Alvares is 
scheduled to talk tomorrow with Senator Beni Veras (Brazilian 
Social Democracy Party -- Ceara State), who was confirmed 
yesterday as rapporteur of the draft law at the Senate Economic 
Affairs Committee, to persuade him about the need to introduce 
changes to the draft approved by the Chamber of Deputies in June 
1993.

  [Text] Rio de Janeiro -- War College (ESG) Commander 
Brigadier Sergio Ferolla said yesterday that efforts to break 
the state's monopoly on the research, production, refining, and 
marketing of petroleum "are the result of pressure from foreign 
groups." In the brigadier's opinion, "petroleum is a strategic 
element, and therefore it is necessary to remain alert to the 
international interests that want to conquer the Brazilian 
petroleum reserves." According to the ESG commander, "society 
must not accept that Brazil be treated like a marginal country." 
  Ferolla advocated state control on petroleum exploration 
during a Science Forum discussion and during a meeting with 
federal university directors, both of which were held at the Rio 
de Janeiro Federal University (UFRJ). In his assessment, 
society has not discussed this issue at length, and it would be 
too early to implement such an important change. Ferolla 
claimed: "If the Constituent Congress decides to break the 
petroleum monopoly, it will be an untimely decision." In the 
ESG commander's opinion, "serious issues like those of 
monopolies should be decided with more coldbloodedness and less 
emotion." 
  The brigadier said it was necessary for society to be more 
conscious to discussion of the great national issues. He asked 
this "especially from young people, who will be carrying out the 
development of our country." Ferolla believes Brazil lacks a 
development model that takes into account the great differences 
existing between its regions. 
  Ferolla noted: "We require strategic planning. This is not 
a job for the military but for the whole of society, because the 
enemy is advancing. All it takes is to notice that our country 
is breaking apart." In the ESG commander's opinion, this 
planning must not take into account the desires of the 
multinational companies "that are viewing the commercial side 
alone." He explained that this does not involve opposing the 
multinational companies. Ferolla concluded: "They may and must 
gain their money, but they must not meddle with our country's 
sovereignty."

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Brazil through 24 February: 
  The Brazilian Petroleum Corporation, Petrobras, today 
announced a new national oil production record: 723,063 barrels 
per day. This is mainly due to the production of three new 
wells in Campos Basin, on the northern coast of Rio de Janeiro 
State. (Brasilia Voz do Brasil Network in Portuguese 2100 GMT 17 
Feb 94) 
  Brazil saved nearly $6.5 million as the result of a cut in 
electricity demand countrywide during the daylight savings 
program. (Brasilia Radio Nacional da Amazonia Network in 
Portuguese 0900 GMT 18 Feb 94) 
  The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics reports 
that the GDP increased by 5 percent in 1993, mainly due to 
industrial activity. The services sector closed the year with 
3.5 percent growth, while farming activities dropped by 1.9 
percent. The manufacturing industry grew the most, registering 
10.1 percent. Activities in the services sector increased mainly 
due to the increase of trade, communications, and transport. 
(Brasilia Voz do Brasil in Portuguese 2100 GMT 19 Feb 94) 
  Plane tickets increased 18.1 percent today. This is the 
third increase this year. Plane tickets increased by a total of 
128.58 percent so far this year. (Brasilia Radio Nacional da 
Amazonia Network in Portuguese 1000 GMT 21 Feb 94) 
  Commercial exchange with Common Market of the South, 
Mercosur, members has gone from $4.5 billion to $8 billion in 
barely three years. Brazilian exports within Mercosur increased 
35 percent and imports 58 percent. Brazilian regional 
investments will total $150 million this year. (Sao Paulo O 
ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 21 Feb 94 p B2) 
  A study conducted by the Interunion Department for 
Statistics 
and Socioeconomic Studies shows that the purchasing power of 
Brazilian workers dropped 55 percent in 1993 compared with 1 
March 1990 when the Collor Plan suspended the monthly salary 
readjustment, causing the biggest drop ever in the country's 
recent history. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 21 Feb 
94 p 6) 
  The National Confederation of Industries on 18 February 
reported that Brazilian industry sales grew 7 percent in 1993 
compared with the previous year. The total salaries paid to 
employees increased 2.4 percent, whereas the average 
installation capacity went from 70.9 percent to 74.2 percent. 
(Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 21 Feb 94 p 7) 
  Federal Government debt in securities increased by $4.3 
billion in January. The record exchange balance of $3.5 billion 
was the main cause. (Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO in Portuguese 22 Feb 
94 p 30) 
  National Privatization Program Chairman Andre Franco Montoro 
Filho on 22 February reported that the Brazilian Government 
auctioned 25 companies valued at $6,447 billion in the 30-month 
period since the privatization program was implemented. (Madrid 
EFE in Spanish 2217 GMT 22 Feb 94) 
  The Brazilian Capital Market Institute has reported that net 
profits of foreign companies working in Brazil increased 488.6 
percent in the first nine months of 1993 compared with the same 
period in 1992. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 
23 Feb 94 p 35) 
  Fuel prices were hiked by 18.5 percent on 24 February, thus 
registering an accrued increase of 88.17 percent so far this 
year. A liter of gasoline now costs 334 real cruzeiros.

  [Text] In 1993, the Brazilian labor movement held more 
strikes, with more participants, than in the previous year. The 
most recent figures come from the Interunion Department for 
Statistics and Socioeconomic Studies (DIEESE), which calculated 
that last year there was a 16.98 percent increase in the number 
of strikes in comparison with 1992, which results in an average 
of 60.83 stoppages a month involving about 432,800 strikers. 
  "The successive declines that occurred in the unemployment 
rate in Brazil starting in May, and an upward trend in a wide 
variety of economic indicators made workers feel more secure and 
more willing to demand their rights," said Eduardo Matosinho, 
technical coordinator of DIEESE. In his view, workers were more 
worried about losing their jobs in 1992 and so avoided 
participating in strikes. According to DIEESE, in 1992 there was 
an average of 52 walkouts a month, involving 234,900 strikers.

*Ratio obtained by multiplying the number of workers on strike by the 
number of hours of work stoppage for the month in question. For calculation 
purposes, a work day is considered to be eight hours for all categories. 


  Matosinho said the public sector was the main arena for work 
stoppages and was responsible for the 84.22 percent increase in 
the average number of strikers last year, compared with the 
previous year. In May, we had the federal civil servant strike. 
Then in August, the Minas Gerais state employees struck, as did 
teachers in Sao Paulo State. 
  This past December, the number of strikes fell by 3.70 
percent and the number of strikers by 74.71 percent, if compared 
with the same month of the previous year. In all, there were 52 
work stoppages involving 12,300 strikers, compared with the 54 
strikes and 234,900 workers who walked out in December 1992. 
  December, according to the technical director, is an 
atypical 
month because most of the strikes were organized to protest 
nonpayment of wages and worker entitlements. "In 1992, the 
recession was worse and more companies had trouble paying their 
employees the required `13th month' salary. Last year, however, 
the strikes were organized by companies and demanded payment of 
a `14th month.'" 
  Matosinho thinks the number of strikes this year will 
probably be about the same as in 1993. "We will never see levels 
as high as in 1989 and 1990," he said. According to DIEESE 
figures, there was an average of 183 work stoppages a month in 
1989, which dropped to 163 the following year.

  [Text] The unemployment rate in Brazil in December, as 
announced yesterday by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and 
Statistics (IBGE), was 4.39 percent, slightly below November's 
4.74 percent. In terms of business sector, the rate fell more 
significantly in commerce (18 percent) and in manufacturing (16 
percent). 
  Among the six metropolitan regions surveyed, the rate showed 
the most significant decline in Recife (27 percent), followed by 
Sao Paulo (11 percent) and Belo Horizonte (8 percent). 
Unemployment among women fell by 8 percent from November 1993, 
while among men, the rate declined by 7 percent. The number of 
employed persons during the same comparison period slipped by 
about 1 percent. 
  In 1993, however, the average number of employed was 1 
percent greater than in 1992, and higher in certain regions, 
such as Belo Horizonte (3 percent) and Porto Alegre and Salvador 
(both with 2 percent). By business sector, the number of 
employed persons rose by 4 percent in commerce, "pulled along" 
by Rio de Janeiro (5 percent) and Sao Paulo and Salvador (both 
at 4 percent). In the services sector (2 percent), the increases 
were higher in Belo Horizonte (4 percent) and Salvador (3 
percent). In terms of numbers employed in construction (4 
percent) the most significant findings were the declines in Sao 
Paulo (6 percent), and in Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, and Recife 
(all three at 4 percent). 
<H5>  Earnings </H5>
  The report also shows that average real income of employed 
persons in November 1993 had risen by 4 percent since the 
previous month. By segment of activity, there were increases in 
the earnings of persons employed in manufacturing (10 percent), 
commerce (7 percent), and services (3 percent).

<F P=106> [Article by Ribeirao Preto correspondent Antonio Costa </F>
Filho] 
  [Text] The Andrade Gutierrez construction group is looking 
for oil in the maritime waters off Cuba. Having installed an 
offshore platform and using its own prospecting personnel, the 
Brazilian company is working on the island as subcontractor to a 
consortium put together by Total, of France, and the Canadian 
firm CMW. 
  Exploration of the Cuban coastline in search of petroleum 
began last year when risk contracts were signed with 
multinational oil companies. Since it has no funds to meet any 
high-cost commitments, Cuba will use the oil taken from the 
bottom of the sea to pay the companies that operate there. 
<H5>  "Indications of Oil" </H5>
  Andrade Gutierrez's efforts, explained Roberto Rivas, 
director for the Americas of the Cuban Cooperation Committee, 
focused first on reserves that had already been analyzed by 
Cuban Government geologists and geophysicists. "We have 
indications that there is petroleum under the sea," said Rivas, 
who is an important adviser to Carlos Lage Davila, considered to 
be the strongman of that country's economy. 
  According to Andrade Gutierrez press advisers, the builder 
has already fulfilled half the contract. The work began on 18 
December 1993. So far, 1,760 meters of drilling has been done in 
three 3,500-meter deep wells in Cardenas Bay, on the north of 
Cuba across from Valadere beach (the country's biggest tourist 
center), according to reporter Elizabeth Rosa. 
  Andrade Gutierrez sets the total value of the project at $9 
million. It took the firm, which began drilling oil wells in 
Brazil early in the 1980's, 13 days just to transport the 
platform from Brazil to the Cuban coastline. According to 
Gutierrez, the platform was inspected by international firms and 
considered to be "in legal and acceptable condition in terms of 
the United States trade embargo against Cuba." 
<H5>  Decline in Production </H5>
  Even during the years of close ties to the Soviet Union, the 
Caribbean island had been producing as much as one million tons 
a year of petroleum, Rivas noted. But since Soviet assistance 
ended, local production has leveled off at about 500,000 tons a 
year, not enough to satisfy domestic needs. 
  The state corporation in charge of business transactions in 
the petroleum field--everything from prospecting to refining and 
distribution--is Cupet Cubana de Petroleos. The current 
off-shore risk contracts, the director of the cooperation 
committee stated, will also have the effect of using the idle 
capacity of the island's three refineries--one in Havana, 
another in Santiago de Cuba, and a third in Cienfuegos. 
Considered the most modern of Cuba's refineries, the plant at 
Cienfuegos has the capacity to refine three million tons of oil 
a year.

  [Excerpts] Brasilia -- The Constituent Congress has 
approved -- 381 votes in favor, 75 against, and five abstentions 
-- the new deadline to end work on the constitutional revision: 
31 May. The promise to approve the deadline date before 
approving the Social Emergency Fund [FSE] was part of an 
informal agreement sealed between rapporteur-general Nelson 
Jobim (PMDB -- RS) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party -- Rio 
Grande do Sul] and the judicial branch. The week before the 
carnival celebrations, Attorney General Aristides Junqueira 
disagreed with the proposal to promulgate the amendments in 
stages, and threatened to resort to the Federal Supreme Court if 
the government decided to promulgate the FSE apart from other 
issues under discussion. The solution to the crisis was to 
establish a deadline for the end of work on the constitutional 
revision. [passage omitted] 
  Planning Minister Alexis Stepanenko handed Congress the 
draft 
bill that made concrete the agreement reached the day before the 
voting to ensure approval of the FSE. The housing area will 
receive $480 million to compensate for the blocking of part of 
the Provisional Tax on Financial Operations in favor of the FSE. 
According to government plans, the budget Law will also ensure 
the same level of investment registered in 1993, including the 
$250 million portion to be used to pay for teachers' salaries. 
Stepanenko bet that the FSE would be approved. "All details 
have already been discussed," he said. 
  According to the economic team, the FSE estimate collection 
decreased from $16.1 billion to $15.5 billion during the FSE 
debate and its voting in Congress. Nevertheless, the FSE will 
ensure the goal of balancing public accounts in 1994, which was 
a pre- requirement for the second stage of the economic plan 
that contemplates the adoption of the Real Value Unit. In the 
opinion of Senate President Humberto Lucena (PMDB -- PB 
[Paraiba]), the fund can be promulgated right after its 
approval, if 293 congressmen support a request in this regard to 
be made by the party leaders.

workers and folded. A communique issued by the newspaper's 
board of directors reported that the economic crisis was 
responsible for the newspaper's folding. 
  Chief Editor Isaias Raw, 62, said the newspaper had been 
operating for two years at a deficit. According to Raw, JORNAL 
DA BAHIA had an average edition of 18,000 copies (5,000 
subscribers) and was mainly circulating in the capital of Bahia 
and in the metropolitan region of Salvador.

  [Excerpt] Foreign Minister Enrique Silva Cimma said the 
government did not present a protest but a document to the 
Arbitration Tribunal, noting a brochure published by the 
Argentine Tourism Under Secretariat locating the Laguna del 
Desierto area in that country's Santa Cruz Province: 
  [Begin Silva Cimma recording] More than a protest, what I 
did 
was present a formal description of the problem to the 
Arbitration Tribunal, communicating to it this situation that is 
contrary to the agreement establishing a deadline after which no 
one can publish anything that might disturb the normal 
development of the process. [end recording] 
  Silva Cimma met President Patricio Aylwin for more than an 
hour to discuss the issue. Asked if the Argentine publication 
somehow constitutes undue Argentine pressure on the judges who 
will decide the Laguna del Desierto dispute, Silva Cimma said: 
  [Begin Silva Cimma recording] It does not really represent 
pressure, perhaps a precedent. We thought it was our duty to 
note it officially, despite the fact that the brochure was not 
really published by the Argentine Government, as you all know. 
The document was issued by a provincial authority, the 
equivalent of a Chilean intendant or governor. We are 
investigating it. It seems that it is not even an official 
document but something published by the province without that 
character. In any case we are investigating the problem, and we 
already have presented a note describing the situation to the 
Arbitration Tribunal. [end recording] 
  So far the government has not received any answer, which is 
obviously expected. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Investigative Police have captured seven members 
of a terrorist Lautaro commando cell that is responsible for 
some of the latest violent incidents, including a double bank 
robbery in La Providencia Commune and the attack on the Nueva 
Espana Carabineros building in La Cisterna Commune. This 
information was confirmed to Radio Cooperativa this afternoon by 
Investigative Police General Director Nelson Mery. 
  This cell is believed to be responsible for a series of 
attacks. Many weapons were found in their possession. 
  [Begin recording] [Mery] They are responsible for the 
attack.... 
  [Unidentified reporter, interrupting] Is it true some 
arrests 
have been made? 
  [Mery] We have arrested eight individuals, all members of 
the 
Lautaro Rebel and Popular Front.... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] Do we know any of them? 
  [Mery] Some are important within their criminal 
organization. 
  [Reporter] How many of them participated in the latest 
attacks? 
  [Mery] They have admitted participating in terrorist 
activities during the past few months, particularly the 
Carabineros premises. 
  [Reporter] How many participated in that attack? 
  [Mery] They were arrested yesterday. We raided their safe 
houses and their alternative hideouts. The police seized M-16 
riffles, submachine guns, explosives, documents describing the 
group's participation in various acts, and materials used to 
forge documents. [end recording] 
  The police seized five M-16 riffles, two UZI submachine 
guns, 
a large quantity of explosives, dynamite, and banners used by 
the Investigative Police. Let us recall that some of these 
individuals used Investigative Police documents and shot at 
Carabineros premises. 
  The Investigative Police has thus dealt a new blow to this 
extremist group. We have been asked to keep the names of the 
terrorists secret, at least for this afternoon. We reiterate, 
five men and two women were arrested; they are responsible for 
the most recent terrorist attacks, particularly the double bank 
robbery in Providencia and the attack on the Carabineros Nueva 
Espana Building.

  [Text] Interior Minister Enrique Krauss has referred to the 
individuals carrying out terrorist actions in the capital as 
cowards and stupid. The minister said those actions are due to 
the transfer of terrorist criminals to the so-called new model 
prison. The minister minimized the importance of the 23 February 
attacks. Asked if security will be increased at political 
parties' offices, Enrique Krauss said: 
  "All appropriate measures were in place at the time of the 
attacks. That is why police were able to act promptly, avoiding 
possible damage to the premises or victims." 
  But do the latest incidents mean that terrorists are active 
again? 
  "They have a minimal capacity for action. When they resort 
to 
these types of actions, which are small, despicable, and 
cowardly, as usual, it means they do not have a large 
capability. It is the typical action of cowards, the kind of 
persons.... [changes thought] They do not have the capacity; 
they are not courageous people. This is the typical action of 
cowards." 
  Regarding the measures to be taken by police, the minister 
said: 
  "The Carabineros and Investigative Police are investigating. 
The appropriate preventive measures are in place. I want to call 
the attention of the country to the fact that we are not facing 
increasing terrorist activities. We are suffering from the 
stupid, despicable, cowardly action of small, insignificant 
groups. We have some concrete leads that we expect will lead to 
the arrest of those responsible." 
  Krauss said no terrorist group has claimed responsibility 
for 
the attacks. There are people in jail because when you act in 
democracy and according to the law there is a clear awareness on 
how to face these incidents. Regarding (ODEP), the so-called 
organization of political prisoners' relatives and friends, 
Krauss said it was a group dedicated to protecting and promoting 
terrorism.

  [Excerpts] Santiago, 23 Feb (EFE) -- Chilean Interior 
Minister Enrique Krauss today characterized the terrorists who 
machine-gunned three young cadets from a prison service school 
in the last few hours and planted several bombs as "stupid, 
irrational, and cowards." [passage omitted] 
  DC [Christian Democratic Party] President Deputy Gutemberg 
Martinez said he thinks the terrorist attacks that began shortly 
before midnight on 22 February are an answer to the transfer of 
44 inmates serving sentences for terrorist activities to a new 
maximum-security prison, where there is a strict system 
regulating visits, and inmates will not be able to dig tunnels 
such as the two discovered in February. 
  Police think terrorist leaders, taking advantage of the 
weaknesses of the old Santiago jail system, have not only 
continued directing their respective groups but also have 
established coordinated action between different prisons. 
  Visits by relatives with direct contact with inmates have 
made possible the introduction of weapons into the prison. On 20 
February, two inmates and four guards were wounded when inmates 
being transferred to the new jail opened fire on the guards with 
half a dozen small guns. 
  Martinez said the new maximum security prison respects all 
the human rights of terrorists inmates, three of whom are in the 
third day of a hunger strike in defense of what their relatives 
describe as "the right to escape." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Peasant and the New Antinarcotics Strategy"] </F>
  [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton recently announced a 
drastic change in the U.S. Government's antinarcotics strategy. 
  The idea is to emphasize prevention rather than repression 
which, generally speaking, has been used since, or even before 
the tenure of President George Bush. 
  One reason for the change of strategy is that the one used 
so 
far has proven ineffective and only increased the number of 
consumers by an average of 140,000 new addicts per year to the 
incredible current number of 10 million consumers. 
  At the same time as it announced the so-called New National 
Antinarcotics Strategy, the White House also asked the U.S. 
Congress to approve a $13.2-billion allocation to implement this 
program. This includes a substantial increase in the funds 
earmarked for cooperation with drug producer countries. 
  This directly concerns us because Peru is the world's 
biggest 
coca leaf producer and the money allocated for cooperation is 
earmarked for eradicating plantations and destroying 
laboratories. 
  U.S. Government officials have said that this money -- which 
will not reach Peru or Bolivia until October -- will also be 
used to strengthen the Peruvian and Bolivian judicial systems 
and to train their respective specialized police units. 
  Despite a relative increase, and the strategy implemented in 
Peru, the main changes by U.S. officials do not seem positive. 
  Iban de Rementeria -- a UN expert in narcotics affairs and 
agricultural development who termed the U.S. strategy "a 
complete turn around" -- has stated that although it is right 
that the United States has admitted for the first time since 
1904 that the drug problem is a domestic problem, there are 
other aspects that reveal faults in the new strategy as far as 
our countries are concerned. 
  Rementeria said: "There should be no illusions because we 
continue alone in this field," adding that prospects for Peru 
and Bolivia are not good because "in their capacity as producers 
they will be abandoned to their fate, they will be given no aid, 
and no importance will be granted to the alternative development 
crops." 
  To a certain extent, the current international agricultural 
policies upheld by the GATT are even more serious because the 
recent Uruguay Round has institutionalized the subsidy system in 
developed countries, condemning agriculture in the Third World 
"to failure." 
  Bolivian Chamber of Deputies President Guillermo Bedregal 
has 
mentioned the serious social conflicts that would be unleashed 
in his country following a cut in the alternative development 
program. 
  As we can see, it is not just a matter of a mere 
substitution 
of plantations, which to a great extend has failed because a 
series of complementary aspects -- such as guaranteeing peasants 
access to market -- were overlooked. 
  Alternative development is what is sought and needed now; so 
that the coca grower's problems will be tackled in a 
comprehensive way, that the peasant will by no means be regarded 
as a delinquent or an accomplice, but merely a producer with 
limited possibilities and without an "alternative" -- for the 
time being -- to survive. 
  The solution to the immensely complex trafficking problem 
must, therefore, contemplate the problem of the peasants -- who 
are on many occasions involuntarily and exploited producers of 
the raw material -- whose needs and interests must also be 
considered.

  [Text] A bill presented by the Executive Branch to the CCD 
[Democratic Constituent Congress] seriously punishing the 
cultivation of poppy has just suffered its first defeat in legal 
experts' circles. According to the bill, the sentences range 
between 12 and 20 years of imprisonment and there is no room for 
procedural benefits. In the Andean Jurists Commission's (CAJ) 
opinion, this openly contradicts the so-called "Fujimori thesis" 
that was included in the 1991 penal code and no longer 
classifies cultivation as a drug-trafficking crime. The 
Executive Branch's bill intends to radically eradicate this 
fairly new crop. The CAJ claims that if peasants raise this 
crop, it will be because its price is competitive and not 
because of fraudulent intention. The CAJ also claims that the 
punishment will not be a deterrent as long as poverty in the 
area prevails. The CAJ claims that the punishment might, 
rather, contribute to increasing prices and cases of corruption 
and abuse by producers, and an overwhelming growth in the prison 
population.

  [Text] PNP [Peruvian National Police] intelligence sources 
disclosed that Wilber Alvarado Linares, aka Champa, one of the 
main drug dealers in the Upper Huallaga, allegedly has taken the 
place of Demetrio Limoniel Chavez Penaherrera, aka Vaticano, as 
the main drug supplier for the Cali cartel. 
  Moreover, the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers, barons of the 
cartel, allegedly have chosen to contact Champa to try to 
recover the advance they paid Vaticano to buy white cocaine 
paste. 
  According to our sources, the arrest of Vaticano in Cali, 
Colombia, will represent a hard blow to the Rodriguez Orejuelas' 
"economy" if they fail to identify the "buyers" who received an 
advance for the purchase of a "large quantity" of drugs. 
  Other traffickers such as "Camboya," "Escorpio," "Santena," 
"Joselito," "Chuquin," "Mecano," "Tico," "Nano," etc., who also 
have "interests" in the Upper Huallaga might also be affected 
for having given Vaticano an advance of several thousands of 
dollars. 
  In this regard, it was learned that Elias Chavez 
Penaherrera, 
aka Lan, who is Vaticano's brother and the pilot of his private 
aircraft, may take Vaticano's place because he knows his 
"contacts" and probably the drug buyers who received the advance 
payment from the Cali cartel. 
  Moreover, the National Intelligence Service has discovered 
that Vaticano and the aforementioned drug traffickers had their 
operations center in the Upper Huallaga, Palma Pampa, Ramal de 
Aspuzana, Huicungo, "Boca de Diablo," Bellavista, and Bolognesi 
Province. 
  As for Demetrio Limoniel Chavez Penaherrera, it was learned 
that the Intelligence Services as well as Dinandro [Antidrug 
Division] are after several of his front men whose names are 
being kept secret and other people also involved in drug 
trafficking.

  [Text] Lima, 22 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Today, a poll revealed 
that 45 percent of Peruvians believe President Alberto Fujimori 
is in control, while a similar percentage of Peruvians believe 
the Armed Forces are in control. According to an Apoyo company 
poll, 45 percent of the population believes the chief of state 
holds power, but a similar percentage believes just the opposite. 
  The poll indicated that 70 percent of the population is 
aware 
that two weeks ago the ruling majority in Congress approved the 
controversial law transferring the case involving the 
disappearance of nine students and a professor from La Cantuta 
University to a military court. Meanwhile, 28 percent of 
Peruvians were not aware of the law, and 64 percent disapproved 
of it because they said such a law violates the autonomy of the 
Judicial Branch. 
  The Apoyo poll also revealed that 72 percent of the 
population believe the Armed Forces indeed pressured Congress to 
approve the law because members of the military institution are 
responsible for the kidnapping and subsequent July 1992 murder 
of the students and professor. Meanwhile, 26 percent believe 
these actions are justified because Peru is experiencing special 
circumstances due to the political violence carried out by 
subversive groups and the need to achieve complete peace. 
  Ruling party Congresswoman Martha Chavez said today that 
unlike what occurred in previous administrations, the Armed 
Forces are currently under the control of the Executive Branch. 
She emphasized that Fujimori, as commander in chief of the Armed 
Forces, issues the antisubversive strategy guidelines and that 
the military forces carry out his orders. Yesterday, Nicolas De 
Bari Hermoza, commander of the Armed Forces Joint Command and 
commander general of the Army, confirmed that the armed 
institutions are subordinate to the president thereby denying 
Fujimori is a "prisoner of the military forces," like a British 
newspaper recently reported. 
  President Fujimori's popularity has dropped from 66 to 58 
percent during the last few weeks. These figures, however, are 
moving further away from the 70 percent popularity rate he 
obtained in October 1993 and the 76 percent he achieved in June 
1992. Analysts believe the enactment of the so-called "Cantuta 
Law" significantly harmed the head of state's popularity. 
  Fujimori strengthened his administration with the support of 
the Armed Forces, especially the Army, after his self-inflicted 
coup on 5 April 1992, when he ordered the dissolution of 
Congress and the intervention of the Judicial Branch and other 
autonomous institutions. On 21 February, the president said such 
isolated cases as La Cantuta must not hinder the 
counterterrorism strategy his government is developing. He 
denied that high-ranking Army officers were involved in the 
disappearance of the students and professor, as minority 
opposition sectors in Congress claim.

  [Text] The brand-new 13 November Civic Movement has 
demanded the release of the Army officers who are serving 
sentences at San Felipe. One year after the military court 
sentenced 25 Army officers to prison for an alleged coup d'etat 
attempt, leaders of the 13 November Civic Movement said this was 
an unconstitutional ruling, therefore it is invalid. 
  General Luis Pastor Vives, president of the organizing 
committee, called for the release of his comrades in arms, 
arguing that the government's uncompromising position had 
priority even though favorable circumstances exist, like the 
promulgation of the new Constitution. A message from Gen. 
Salinas Sedo was transmitted during a news conference in which 
he expressed his disagreement with his sentence although he 
emphasized he preferred prison to an undignified freedom. 
Meanwhile, his attorney indicated that Congress should pass an 
amnesty law for the prisoners.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Fujimori Denies Any Negotiation"] </F>
  [Text] During his short trip to Colombia (which seems to 
have been a total success), President Alberto Fujimori denied he 
had been negotiating with Abimael Guzman and other imprisoned 
Shining Path leaders. The president also denied that he wanted 
to reduce Guzman's sentence to life imprisonment. 
  The president was obviously answering an alarming piece of 
news disseminated by television on 16 February, according to 
which the government signed a 10-point "peace agreement" with 
Guzman that included an item on improving Guzman's prison 
conditions and ended with a general amnesty for him and his 
henchmen. 
  It was good for Fujimori to have denied in Bogota the 
existence of such a pact because it worried some groups of 
people -- which possibly constitute a majority of the population 
-- who worry more about the severity with which they think 
terrorists should be treated than for the alleged trampling of 
their human rights. 
  These groups reacted with indignation when President 
Fujimori 
said he had granted Guzman and Iparraguirre preferential 
treatment in order to get them to write the letters calling for 
peace. This indignation was reflected in the polls at the time. 
We will never know how many "Yes" votes [for the approval of the 
new Constitution] he lost with that revelation. 
  He should not then repeat the mistake by stumbling on the 
same rock again. Guzman's letters had the positive effect of 
creating great confusion among Shining Path cadres, true, and 
encouraging a split between their leaders and militants. But 
they have not stopped the violence, which has continued. This 
continued violence has made many people doubt government 
policies on the matter, believing that they are unnecessarily 
indulgent with individuals who do not deserve anything other 
than the harshest punishment. 
  In fact, as we proposed in this column earlier, the 
efficient 
Justice Minister Fernando Vega Santa-Gadea should make public a 
detailed report on Guzman's imprisonment conditions and what 
assurances we have that he will not be able to leave his jail 
until the end of his days. The television crew who filmed him 
without his striped uniform, warmly calling for an unconvincing 
pacification, should now show us where he is and who he is 
talking to. 
  Because we still have the bitter taste of his letter with 
instructions to Scandinavian Shining Path followers, which was 
first published by EXPRESO, and the fact that no one was able to 
explain how the letter left the jail, first, and how it left the 
country, second.

  [Excerpts] The National Counterterrorism Directorate 
[Dincote] on 10 February confirmed the definite division of the 
Shining Path into two antagonistic factions, which could lead to 
the subversive organization's total defeat. [passage omitted] 
  Police also discovered a Shining Path training camp the 
so-called "People's Liberation Army" and "People's Help" had 
been using for training, physical preparation, and the use of 
guns and explosives. 
  Police reported on 10 February that the training camp was 
located at the top of Casablanca Hill, in the Jose Carlos 
Mariategui shantytown, near Miguel Castro Castro prison in San 
Juan de Lurigancho. 
  During the raid on the area, police found explosives and the 
inscriptions of the aliases of the 10 [number as published] 
alleged terrorists arrested. 
  According to the Dincote report, they have been identified 
as 
Miriam Tarazona Trujillo (21), alias "Rocio," and Jorge Manuel 
Linares Bustamante, 25, alias "Francisco" or "Santiago." The two 
are members of the PCP-SL [Peruvian Communist Party-Shining 
Path] defense department "leadership cell." 
  Police agents presented to the press the following 
individuals as "People's Liberation Army members:" Rolando 
Hector Limachi Arevalo, alias "John," responsible for the 
southern zone; Marco Antonio Huamani Soriano, alias "Mario," 
from the political command; and Shiomara Velasco Chavez, alias 
"Edith," from the military command. 
  Police also presented "combatants" Miguel Angle Santillan 
Coronel, alias "Jefri;" Jesus Honorato Alfaro Barrientos, alias 
"Helton;" Oswaldo Cuya Garcia, alias "Luis;" and Carmen Consuelo 
Llanos Inga, alias "Laura." 
  Also presented in striped uniforms were communicators 
Alejandro Arturo Mayta Manrique, 33, handicapped -- he walks 
with an orthopedic leg with a lot of difficulty; and Jose Carlos 
Lopez Torres, 25. 
  According to Dincote, the last two are allegedly members of 
the Shining Path's "People's Help" apparatus support department 
(health section). 
  The Dincote agents stressed that with the arrest of these 
individuals, police neutralized terrorist activities being 
planned for metropolitan Lima's southern area. 
  In the individuals' possession police found six sketches of 
streets, markets, and religious temples drawn by the PCP-SL 
People's Guerrilla Army to be used in the sabotage of bank 
offices and Pension Fund Administration (AFP) offices, and to 
paint walls, distribute pamphlets, and murder policemen. 
  Dincote charged the arrested subversives with the 
destruction 
of five bank branches, Guido de Surquillo's bakery in San Juan 
de Miraflores municipality, and the frustrated homicide of a PNP 
[Peruvian National Police] lieutenant whose last name is Valle. 
  They also were held responsible for the sabotage against the 
Peruvian Radio Television (Channel 7) station and Latin 
Frequency (Channel 2) building on 14 January 1991 and 5 June 
1992, respectively.

  [Text] Accompanied by members of the diplomatic corps 
accredited to Cuba, and Cuban and foreign journalists, Robaina 
has just completed a work trip to Pinar del Rio Province. This 
is what he had to say during the return trip to Havana: 
  "There could not be a Cuban foreign policy and Cuba would 
not 
have the voice and vote it has today if it were not thanks to 
the dedication we have seen in the fields, thanks to the 
dedication we saw at the biological factories, thanks to the 
efforts of so many men and women whom we do not have the 
privilege of personally knowing, and who do this 24 hours a day 
under conditions much more difficult and complex than those 
under which I travel the world." 
  Regarding the results of his first year as head of the 
Foreign Ministry, Robaina said: 
  "It has meant a significant change in my life, not so for 
the 
work. I believe the only reason we have to be pleased is that it 
seems that some people believe that we are doing what needs to 
be done. I am not comparing whether the work is better or worse 
than that done before me. I prefer to think that we do today 
what we do thanks to what was done before. My only interest is 
for the foreign policy conducted to reflect the times. I believe 
we have been doing so." 
  Foreign journalists asked Robaina the trite question about 
his work style as head of the Foreign Ministry. 
  "I insist that when I was given this responsibility I was 
not 
given conditions. They simply knew me when they appointed me. 
The mission I was given was to conduct the country's foreign 
policy following aspects of the work initiated with the youth 
dealing with our image abroad. I can say that no one has asked 
me to change my style. I was given a task and I have assumed it 
in the manner I think it should be assumed. I also think that 
style is part of the revolutionary training. I do not think it 
is just the fruit of an individual's private initiative. I think 
I have interpreted the revolution in this manner and I am trying 
to carry it out. 
  ``Concerning contradictions and concerns about this mission, 
I think there were concerns when I was appointed foreign 
minister. Concerns and worries will always exist, and there will 
be favorable and unfavorable opinions about this mission. But I 
can honestly say that I do not worry about the number of people 
who might be in favor or against this mission. I do that which I 
am positively convinced is the best thing to do.''

  [Editorial Report] Montevideo LA MANANA in Spanish on 17 
February publishes on page 6 a 500-word unattributed article on 
a cooperation agreement signed by the Andean Development 
Corporation, CAF, and the Latin American Integration 
Association, Aladi, which will enable CAF "to identify 
investment opportunities" in 11 Aladi member countries. 
  CAF Chairman Enrique Garcia Rodriguez told LA MANANA that 
the 
agreement will be instrumental in helping Aladi member countries 
in their integration drive. The article quotes Garcia Rodriguez 
as saying: "We believe we can play a support role in trade 
exchanges between the different integration areas like the 
Andean Group; the Common Market of the South; the group of three 
-- Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela; the Central American Common 
Market; and Chile, which even though it is not a member of these 
groups, furthers an open policy toward integration." 
  Garcia Rodriguez noted: "Seventy percent of CAF credits are 
earmarked for bolstering private initiatives."

  [Text] The creation of an International Judicial Assistance 
Office, involving the United Nations and each country of the 
continent, to promote the exchange of information that may 
contribute to complete investigations into cases of drug 
trafficking, was approved during the recent South American 
Antidrug Convention. This was an initiative of the Peruvian 
delegation. 
  Information on this important agreement was disclosed by 
Ernesto Vera Tudela, member of the 11th Lima Criminal Superior 
Court, who represented Peru together with Victor Prado, Judge 
Irma Simeon, and prosecutor Loayza y Sanchez of the Attorney 
General's Office. 
  The convention was held in Bogota, Colombia, and had the 
merit, thanks to Peru, of implementing an agreement that was 
signed but never enacted in 1988, when the first proposal to 
create a Judicial Assistance Office of these characteristics was 
made. 
  Vera Tudela said that the Peruvian proposal was approved and 
received the congratulations of the Colombian Justice Minister 
himself, in view of the fact that offices of this nature, at a 
continental level, are currently necessary to provide 
information requested by any Judicial Branch of the area in 
order to be able to complete an investigation. 
  Vera Tudela commented: "Police investigations were only 
coordinated through Interpol, but we lack a coordination between 
Judicial Branches in order to be able to complete investigations 
which many times reach a stalemate because the necessary 
evidence or information is retained in another country." 
  He added that the purpose is to create this office at a 
Judicial Branch level so that it can encourage the signing of 
conventions and agreements of public need, to allow the 
clarification not only of drug trafficking crimes but also 
crimes against the state, trafficking in minors, etc.

  [Text] Exiled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide has 
presented counterproposals in reaction to the political plan of 
a group of Haitian parliamentarians. He would require first the 
departure of the military who overthrew him, then his return to 
power within 10 after the designation of a prime minister. In a 
letter to the UN Security Council, a copy of which AFP acquired 
on 23 February, Haitian Ambassador to the United Nations Fritz 
Longchamp presented the sequence proposed by President Aristide 
for an irreversible resolution of the Haitian crisis. 
  This sequence provides first for the departure of the 
leaders 
of the 30 September 1991 coup d'etat, as stated in the Governors 
Island accord. This can be obtained through the adoption of 
more severe sanctions against Haiti by the UN Security Council 
along with efforts to put an end to the flood of goods entering 
the country through the border with the Dominican Republic, the 
document adds. President Aristide's proposal then provides for 
the adoption by the Haitian parliament of some measures 
including an amnesty for the military and a law on the creation 
of a new police force. The following steps include the 
deployment of the UN technical assistance mission, the 
designation of a new prime minister, and the return of President 
Aristide 10 days after this appointment. Finally, Mr. Aristide's 
plan provides for the lifting of the sanctions adopted by the UN 
Security Council, the prime minister's taking the oath, and the 
resumption of economic assistance to Haiti. 
  These counterproposals have been presented by President 
Aristide following the plan proposed in Washington last week by 
a group of Haitian parliamentarians. This plan, which is 
actively supported by the United States, provides first for the 
appointment of a prime minister and the creation of a government 
of concord, but does not specify a date for Aristide's return to 
Port-au-Prince. 
  According to Mr. Longchamp, it would be irresponsible to 
proceed to designate any prime minister -- who would risk his 
own life -- before the deployment of the UN mission. UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, who talked on the phone 
with Aristide on the evening of 22 February, had no comments to 
make for the moment on Mr. Longchamp's letter, stated UN 
spokesman Joe Sills. Mr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali implicitly 
supported this week the plan of the parliamentarians. The 
secretary general invited President Aristide to come quickly to 
UN headquarters to continue the discussions with representatives 
of the friends of Haiti -- including Canada, the United States, 
France, and Venezuela -- in an attempt to look for a solution to 
the crisis, Mr. Sills added. However, Mr. Aristide, who has to 
go to Europe in the next few days, advised Mr. Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali that he would contact him on his return scheduled 
for 5 March. This answer has given rise to a certain irritation 
among UN officials in New York.

<F P=106> [Report by Francisco Rubio in Chiapas from the "First Thing </F>
in the Morning" newscast; passages within quotation marks 
recorded] 
  [Text] Agreements have already been reached on five points, 
which constitute one-fourth of the neo-Zapatists' [as heard] 
demands. 
  [Zapatist Subcommander Marcos] "So far, we have received 
satisfactory replies to our demands on the following points: 
health, education, true and timely information, housing, and 
respect for culture, traditions, rights, and the dignity of the 
Indian groups in Mexico." 
  Other, more complex demands which were not mentioned will be 
submitted to advisory groups for study, and, even Marcos has 
admitted, there are other proposals that go beyond the 
possibilities of these negotiations. 
  [Subcommander Marcos] "Let it be understood that what the 
Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] wants is that just like 
the war was decided in a democratic manner, peace must 
necessarily follow the same democratic procedure." 
  The rebel subcommander and EZLN delegates are not rushing to 
reach definite agreements. 
  [Subcommander Marcos] "You must return to your areas; you 
must return to your committees and explain to your companions 
the proposals you have received regarding the points which 
started our movement on 1 January 1994. The communities will 
then decide yes or no." 
  [Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis] "We are making 
much 
faster progress in discussing these problems than I expected at 
the beginning of these meetings." 
  Camacho Solis announced he will follow a similar process. 
  [Camacho Solis] "I will report to the president of the 
republic on each one of the points we have agreed on. I will 
also report to the mixed commission of senators and deputies, 
and I will seek to report to the main political forces 
[pauses]... to all the political forces of the country so there 
will be a broad consensus." 
  New faces were seen during the third day of negotiations in 
San Cristobal de las Casas. These included Monterrey Archbishop 
Adolfo Suarez; Oaxaca Archbishop Hector Gonzalez; and Bishops 
Carlos Talavera from (Cuatzacualcos), Felipe Aguirre from Tuxtla 
Gutierrez, and Felipe Arismendi from Tapachula. They are all 
members of a special commission of the Mexican Bishops 
Conference, which is following the peace process. They will meet 
with political parties representatives and leaders of 
nongovernmental organizations. 
  (Arturo Warman), ombudsman for agrarian affairs, was also 
seen here. He is studying the possible juridical modifications 
that will result from agreements over the land problems.

<F P=106> [Report on telephone interview with Guatemalan President </F>
Ramiro de Leon Carpio by Karl Yvan Arevalo; place and date not 
given; no quotation marks as published] 
  [Text] Regarding the possibility of a coup d'etat, 
President de Leon Carpio notes that historically it could not be 
farther from coming true. There are internal and external 
factors that would not allow this to happen, and the Army 
officers themselves are aware that this should not happen. 
  De Leon added that the activities in which some citizens 
might have engaged near the Government House before his 
announcement of the recent changes in the National Defense 
General Staff are routine and Guatemalans can be certain that 
there is absolute peace in this sense. Some day we will be able 
to dissipate from the minds of our fellow countrymen the idea of 
the traditional coup d'etat because the officers are aware of 
the democratic role they must play. The commander general of 
the Army has all the support of the High Command. 
  Referring to the three changes that have occurred in the 
military leadership during his government, De Leon Carpio 
explained that those are institutional and not personal 
decisions of the president. De Leon Carpio added that these 
changes are in line with adjustments by a government that 
assumed power in a situation unprecedented in history because no 
president has accepted the challenge he faced -- to become 
president amid an institutional crisis, the legacy of former 
President Jorge Serrano. 
  I accepted the command of a vessel about to sink amid 
turbulence. Now, however, I am satisfied that I have guided the 
vessel to more peaceful waters because I strengthened the 
institutions. The political difficulty has been overcome since 
the purge achieved by a referendum that made history. Entirely 
secure in the institutional since, we currently have political 
stability. 
  The first change was the removal of General Jose Domingo 
Garcia Samayoa, who was the defense minister. This change had 
to take place given the fact that we were trying to strengthen 
the democratic system and the same chain of command that had 
been in place up until 25 May could not be maintained. 
  The second change, which occurred 21 days later, was the 
removal of General Roberto Perussina, who had replaced Garcia in 
the said post. This decision was also based on the same logic. 
The third and most outstanding change took place on 18 February 
and involved General Jose Luis Quilo Ayuso, who was replaced in 
the post of chief of the National Defense General Staff by 
General Marco Antonio Gonzalez Taracena. This change confirms 
the strengthening of the institutions. 
  De Leon explained the situation once the institutional 
crisis 
was solved: I can say that I have settled and not merely sat in 
the presidency, and that I am willing to face the social and 
economic problems. In order to solve the main problems, we will 
have to implement a government agenda that considers the 
investment of 28 percent of the budget to fight poverty. In 
addition, we are facing a serious financial problem, and this is 
why we need to obtain resources through taxes. 
  Regarding the current social crisis, I must clarify that 
this 
is a problem that I inherited, which does not mean that I will 
ignore it. In the beginning I concentrated on consolidating 
democracy and prepared, on a temporary basis, a 180-day program 
with a few resources to tackle some social problems. Now we must 
develop the government plan, which should not be subject to the 
interests of any specific sector. Although our policies might 
agree with the interests of some groups on certain aspects, they 
are definite, and our goals regarding the exchange, credit, 
labor, monetary, and other fields are clearly established. I 
have not bowed to political, military, or economic interests. 
  In order to promote this work, I am inviting Guatemalans to 
help me create a national project with the participation of all 
sectors of this society. 
  Regarding the controversy triggered by an apparent change 
in course, which came when he moved from human rights ombudsman 
to his current position as president, the president affirmed 
that his point of view regarding the Civilian Self-Defense 
Patrols [PAC] had not changed in the least. 
  I have recordings in which I clearly present my position on 
the PAC's. I have kept the same point of view since I wrote the 
constitutional provisions on the issue as a member of the Group 
of 30 at the National Constituent Assembly. I upheld my position 
as human rights ombudsman and I now have the opportunity to 
continue defending it as president. 
  My attitude remains the same. I believe the PAC's are groups 
of civilians being used militarily. They are a necessary evil 
because we are at war, a war whose main objective is to diminish 
the insurgent movements' power. 
  I believe that the confusion began when a PAC member gave me 
a rifle when I visited a hamlet where there were hundreds of 
other patrolmen. The photograph of that instance circled the 
world and was misinterpreted. They did not report what followed. 
The peasant gave me the weapon and told me that it represented 
the surrender of all PAC weapons to their commander in chief 
once peace is signed in Guatemala. 
  I must clearly state that there are some PAC leaders who are 
guilty of abuse. These men must be punished in accordance with 
the law. The case of journalist Jorge Carpio could be an 
example, if it can be proven that the attack during which three 
people died was carried out by one of these groups. 
  The president also stated that hundreds of peasants all over 
the country and particularly in the east have voluntarily left 
the patrols. Many have gone on to organize peace and 
development committees. I have also ordered the gradual 
dissolution of the PAC's in areas where they are now unnecessary. 
  I continue to uphold my values and principles. I believe 
there are patrol leaders who should be punished. Even so, I 
maintain what I said repeatedly when I was ombudsman: These 
groups must not be disbanded as long as we have an armed 
conflict. Those who want them disbanded are acting on personal 
interest or out of ignorance. 
<H5>  A Government in Search of Peace </H5>
  Almost at the close of our interview, de Leon Carpio said 
that his main goal is to give his successor a nation in peace, 
even though he received it in war. Although he does not believe 
he can change the nation's structure, he said he wants to create 
irreversible conditions that will promote such changes. 
  The truth of the matter is that Guatemalans are aware of the 
honesty in which we are handling the matters of state. There 
are no more obscure or secret transactions taking place, and, 
although there is still corruption in the Executive Branch, we 
are fighting to eliminate it, which in itself sets a precedent 
in Latin America. 
  The one most important thing about my administration is that 
I am going to leave the country with a taste for participation, 
which is growing through honesty. I want to be remembered as 
the honest president who knew how to administrate the country 
properly. 
  De Leon Carpio also addressed the course that privatization 
of state enterprises could take. On this he explained that it 
has been proven that the state is an inefficient administrator. 
It will be necessary to force it to compete. If our 
Constitution states that there must be no monopolies, we must 
find a way to eliminate them in a manner in which the end 
beneficiaries are the customers who use the services. I am ready 
to make whatever decisions are needed, even if that implies some 
sort of political cost. I am ready to privatize as soon as the 
time is right. Other presidents have been afraid to face this 
problem because it will be costly at the polls later on. I have 
no party. Therefore, it is easier for me to make these decisions. 
  The workers must leave their fears about this policy behind. 
They have an example in FEGUA [Guatemalan Railroad Company]. 
This enterprise already went through the process. The ones who 
got the most out of it were the workers. Not only do they get 
their wages, but they are now working for a disciplined and 
visionary corporation with highly promising plans for the future. 
  Privatization should not be misunderstood, because its goal 
is to improve the services and goods for the customers. Through 
this process, then, public schools and hospitals will be better 
managed. It is the people themselves who are the best ones to 
carry this out because they can organize family committees or 
trusteeships to get the best results. In so doing we will be 
implementing social supervision.

  [Text] Maria del Rosario Casas, the Colombian spy who was 
working for the Russian KGB, had access to confidential 
information on the M-19 [19 April Movement] peace process during 
the time she worked at the Colombian Embassy in Mexico. The 
question that emerges now is if she also provided information 
concerning Colombian domestic policy to the CIA. 
  During her time at the embassy, Casas not only had access to 
intimate information on the Colombian guerrillas but on other 
Central American subversive groups who at that time took their 
ideological leadership from the USSR. 
  Rafael Vergara Navarro, the M-19's international secretary, 
addressed the issue. 
  [Begin Vergara recording] In 1982 and 1983 there was 
considerable intellectual and political activity in Mexico. If 
she was, in fact, working for the CIA, she was in a marvelous 
position to prepare her reports and submit them. [end recording] 
  Residents of the San Diego neighborhood in Cartagena have 
vague memories of the Casas-Ames couple, who made rare visits to 
a home they own there. Augusto Vaca, a neighbor, had this to 
say about the Ames. 
  [Begin Vaca recording] They were very quiet, reserved 
people. They never established close connections in the 
neighborhood. [end recording] 
  According to residents of San Diego, the alleged spy couple 
last visited the neighborhood in 1987.

  [Text] The Nicaraguan Government and the leaders of the 
recontras today began their first direct meeting to discuss the 
disarmament of the rebels and peace in the country's north, 
where there has been violence the past few years. Sources within 
the Government Ministry, the Army, the OAS, and the Catholic 
Church confirmed the start of the talks in village of Caulatu 
near the Honduran border. The OAS and the church are acting as 
mediators. 
  The delegation of recontras from the so-called 3-80 Northern 
Front is led by its leader, Jose Angel Talavera, alias El 
Chacal. The government is represented by Government Minister 
Alfredo Mendieta and Colonel Javier Carrion, the Army's deputy 
chief of staff. The mediation commission comprises members of 
the OAS and the Catholic Church who will verify fulfillment of 
any agreements reached within the next few days concerning the 
demobilization and disarmament of the recontras.

  [Text] President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada's government 
yesterday confirmed its inflexible will to overcome our 
landlocked status, 115 years after losing the port of 
Antofagasta. 
  A Foreign Ministry communique notes: "The policy of 
recovering Bolivia's sea outlet follows the world 
democratization, trade opening, cooperation enhancement, and 
true integration processes." 
  The communique adds: "Bolivia's access to the Pacific Ocean, 
through a free, sovereign, and useful outlet, through diplomatic 
procedures, is a priority for our country and our government. 
It is supported by the hemispheric community." 
  The then-Bolivian port of Antofagasta was seized on 14 
February 1879 by the Chilean Army, thus initiating the "War of 
the Pacific;" a military conflict that involved the Republic of 
Peru and ended in the loss by Bolivia of the Littoral Department 
to Chile. 
  The national territory's amputation was consummated through 
a 
Peace and Borders Treaty signed under Chilean pressure in 1904 
which sentenced Bolivia to become a landlocked country. Various 
attempts to negotiate a revision of the treaty have failed due 
to the Chilean unswerving refusal to consider Bolivian 
aspirations. 
  Diplomatic relations between the two countries have been 
severed since 1962, apart from a brief interval during the 
government of former de facto President Hugo Banzer. 
  The Foreign Ministry notes that the sea recovery claim will 
remain unchanged in all international forums. 
  The Foreign Ministry says: "We are committed to pursue, at 
the appropriate forums and based on a national consensus, the 
appropriate actions to favorably resolve Bolivia's sea claim, 
thus implementing justice in international relations and an 
effective Latin American fraternity."

  [Text] Although it is the first time since 1904 the United 
States has admitted that drug trafficking is also a U.S. 
domestic problem, expectations regarding the U.S. Government's 
change of attitude regarding countries such as Peru and Bolivia 
are not very encouraging because "in their capacity as 
producers, they will be abandoned to their fate; they will be 
given no aid and no importance will be granted to alternative 
development crops (for coca leaves)." 
  This statement was made on 10 February by the UN expert on 
drug affairs and agricultural development, Iban de Rementeria, 
who said the change in the antidrug strategy announced on 9 
February by U.S. President Bill Clinton represents a "complete 
change in U.S. antidrug policy." 
  De Rementeria said: "Since 1904 the United States has 
maintained that drugs are a foreign problem. This is the first 
time they have admitted it is a domestic problem. This is a 
step forward because they admit that it is a health and 
educational problem and not just a police issue." 
  The UN official believes this change of attitude regarding 
the drug problem was promoted by the failure of the U.S. 
administration's antidrug policy, which during the past few 
years cost more than $10 billion per year. 
  "Drug consumption in the United States has really not 
dropped. During the past six years the number of consumers has 
remained more or less the same," he said as he commented that it 
is estimated there are 10 million cocaine and marijuana addicts 
in the United States. 
  In referring to Clinton's new strategy, de Rementeria said: 
"We must not have illusions because we remain alone in this 
field." 
  From his viewpoint, the importance of reducing or 
substituting coca crops has become a secondary issue. 
  De Rementeria added: "I do not see how we can plan an 
alternative development program with the current international 
agricultural policies if the GATT Uruguay Round has 
institutionalized subsidies in developed countries and this 
condemns agriculture in the Third World to failure."

<F P=106> [Report by Claudio Herrera] </F>
  [Text] The Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) today 
received the endorsement of the Revolutionary Party of the 
Workers (PRT), which regards it the "best possible (electoral) 
option" and feels the task now is to "defeat at the polls the 
oligarchic alliance (Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican 
Movement], Morena [National Renewal Movement], Civic Renewal 
Party)." 
  The PRT, which is reorganizing, threw its support behind the 
PRD in a communique that stated that the latter offers an 
internal structure "that allows for the opening of (basic) 
maneuvering room for participation that is comparatively more 
democratic." 
  In its analysis the PRT leaders gather that since the Civic 
Democratic Opposition Alliance took control in 1989 it began "to 
fragment as a result of the decisive impact of its abuses, 
irrational greed, ill-disguised corruption, and, of course, its 
systematic measures against the nation and the people." 
According to the PRT, the errors of that alliance "were nothing 
more than the inevitable and fitting result of the social nature 
of the governing individual." 
  The PRT document, signed by Graciela Dixon, Egbert 
Wetherborne, and Ramiro Guerra, indicated that "based on its 
ideals, origin, and historic reason, the PRD is more committed 
to the national tasks pending at the end of the century." The 
group also pledged to work for the PRD platform, "because with 
the people in power it will be possible to continue the struggle 
for an improved national and popular option."

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the Panamanian elections 
scheduled for 8 May 1994. 
  All Electoral Tribunal magistrates reiterated that no time 
extension would be allowed for election candidates to register 
and that the 8 February deadline at 1630 was announced long ago. 
The Authentic Liberal Party rallied outside the tribunal to 
protest the decision. It was also reported that the Civic 
Renewal Party presidential candidate, Ruben Dario Carles, 
visited the Victoriano Lorenzo Corregimiento in San Miguelito 
District where he walked through several streets and met with 
residents who expressed their community problems. Carles 
mentioned his recent trip to Honduras where he saw how certain 
industries operate. Carles suggested that similar industries in 
Panama could help reduce unemployment. Carles said: "We have 
visited San Miguelito several times, and greater attention to 
education, health, work, transportation, and security is needed 
in this area." (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 
2300 GMT 16 Feb 94) 
  President Guillermo Endara challenged presidential 
candidates 
who use government corruption as their campaign topic to present 
the necessary evidence. Replying to a reporter's question about 
a possible punishment vote by dissatisfied groups, Endara 
replied: "I cannot see why my government should be punished for 
having gone by the book. Everyone is free to vote whichever way 
they please, but a punishment vote is a wasted vote." (Panama 
City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 17 Feb 94) 
  Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential candidate for the 
United People Alliance, which is comprised of the PRD, 
Democratic Revolutionary Party, the Labor Party, and the Liberal 
Republican Party, presented formal registration documentation to 
the electoral tribunal and explained the party's name as "a 
desire to work for the best popular interests, for Panama's most 
needy and humble" and referred to the current administration as 
"belonging to the elite." On repeated charges of close contacts 
with former dictator Noriega, he replied: "Who, me? I have 
never had contacts with Noriega, much less now. I was a great 
friend of Omar Torrijos, who was a great nationalist and popular 
leader, who was also a member of the military. But I have no 
friends among the military, my friends are individuals." (Panama 
City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 18 Feb 94) 
  The Solidarity Party presidential candidate, Samuel Lewis 
Galindo, was interviewed by Carlos Singares, and one of the 
topics he discussed was U.S. military bases. He said that as 
long as the United States is interested in keeping military 
bases in Panama there is a possibility for this to be 
renegotiated. Nevertheless, he added that one needs to take 
into account that with the end of the Cold War, closure of U.S. 
bases everywhere is a topic of current interest. (Panama City EL 
SIGLO in Spanish 20 Feb 94 p 16) 
  After touring the Betania area with his wife and other PRD 
leaders, Ernesto Perez Balladares gave assurances that he will 
win the presidential election by a landslide and downplayed 
disparaging comments by certain political sectors. He would not 
comment on Carles' political campaign or on criticism by former 
Defense Force Chief Ruben Dario Paredes. (Panama City LA 
ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 21 Feb 94 p 1) 
  Candidate Carles told a group of professionals, workers, and 
businessmen that his political project is to streamline the 
government in order to have enough savings for public works and 
investments that will generate employment and fight poverty. He 
said that his administration "must impose on itself the task of 
productive, immediate, intelligent, and optimum exploitation of 
all our advantages for the benefit of Panama and Panamanians; 
employment must stop being a specter in the thousands of homes 
of our fellow citizens." Carles also pledged to end 
discrimination towards women and stressed the need for women to 
participate in all public and private activities. (Panama City 
LA PRENSA in Spanish 21 Feb 94 p 20a) 
  Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, the Arnulfist Party presidential 
candidate, said that defense forces are not needed to guarantee 
security and that the country will not return to a military 
system. She did not rule out, however, a special canal 
protection force. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in 
Spanish 2300 GMT 21 Feb 94) 
  A Molirena, Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement, source 
reported that Carles traveled to Colombia to meet with President 
Cesar Gaviria to discuss bilateral topics. (Panama City LA 
PRENSA in Spanish 22 Feb 94 p 1a) 
  CADE, Annual Conference of Business Executives, has invited 
all presidential candidates to explain their programs to improve 
western Panama -- Chiriqui and Bocas del Toro Provinces -- 
during the upcoming meeting in Bambito. Candidates Jose 
Salvador Munoz, of the Doctrinaire Panamenist Party, and Ruben 
Blades, of the Papa Egoro Movement, have excused themselves.

<H5>  Letter to the media </H5>
  The purpose of this letter is to report on the public 
finance 
situation to the Executive Branch through the media covering the 
following aspects: 
  1. The imbalance that has occurred due to the balance in 
hand situation, taking into consideration the 1994 budget 
compared to what is really available. 
  2. The direct dependence between the investment budget and 
foreign credits resources. 
  3. The structural problem of the government budget where 
current resources do not cover the costs of operations. 
  4. The public debt service which, in the future, will become 
one of the economic and fiscal topics of most importance for all 
Panamanians. 
  5. An explanation of why the Comptroller General's Office 
did not reserve 22 million balboas of the so-called 
"parliamentary initiatives." 
  6. The Finance and Treasury Ministry's responsibility of 
obtaining the necessary resources for complying with the budget 
of current resources. 
  7. The need to take measures to control public expenses as 
of right now, so we will spend only what we can afford. 
  Panamanians are confronting several challenges and problems 
which we must extensively analyze to try and find the best 
solutions. We have decided to send you this note, and we 
apologize for not sending a copy to each person individually, 
but we wanted you to know to whom we sent a copy so as to guide 
public opinion in a responsible manner. 
  At first, we thought of inviting you to a meeting at the 
Comptroller General's Office to give you more details and 
explanations, but we think it would be difficult at this time 
because of your many duties. We are at your service for any 
additional explanations you may need. 
  Yours truly, 
  [signed] J. Chen Barria, Comptroller General 
<H5>  Report to the president </H5>
  Your Excellency: 
  Early in January 1994, you asked me to present our 
preliminary impressions of the 1994 national budget and the 
country's fiscal situation before the Cabinet Council. When some 
changes took place in the Cabinet Council in early 1994, you 
once again expressed concern for the difficult 1994 fiscal 
situation of the government, and you asked us, on Thursday, 3 
February, to present before the new cabinet during its first 
formal session a report on the 1993 budget implementation and 
our comments for 1994, which we are doing in writing in this 
note. 
  1. The constitutional framework: Budget Equilibrium. 
  Article 267 of the Constitution of the Republic establishes 
that expenditures will balance with revenues in the budget 
prepared by the Executive Branch. Therefore, the Constitution 
requires that the budget is balanced. 
  2. Law 32 of 31 December 1993. 
  This is the law by which the national state budget was 
approved. Article 135 says: "The general state budget consists 
of estimating revenues and the maximum authorized expenditures 
that central government institutions, decentralized entities, 
public enterprises, and intermediator financial organizations 
can commit to for the corresponding term. [no closing quote 
marks as published] 
  The Comptroller General's Office is not responsible for 
preparing the General Budget of the nation. This law establishes 
the state general budget in the amount of 3.9044 billion 
balboas, of which 1.9286 billion balboas correspond to the 
central government budget (Annex No. 1). 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|The Revenue and Expenditures Budget of the Central Government is as follows (| 
|in billions of balboas):                                                     | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Total Revenue                         |1.9286                                | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Current Revenue                       |1.4158                                | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Capital Revenue                       |.5128                                 | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  [Text]The estimated capital revenues include: 
  -- Resources from foreign credit in the amount of 324.3 
million 
balboas (loans from international financing institutions, 
credits, 
and donations from governments and other institutions.) 
  -- Balance in hand and in the bank for 96.2 million balboas. 
(Annex No. 2) 
  Details of the expense budget are as follows: 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Operation costs                       |$ 1.5479 billion                      | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|(Public debt)                         |(493.0) million                       | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|(Operation transfers)                 |(269.5) million                       | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Investment costs                      |380.67 million                        | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  The $1.5479 billion in operation costs includes $493.0 
million in public debt service expenses and $296.9 million in 
transfers to other agencies. 
  3. Why does 1994 start with a projected fiscal deficit of 
$79.6 million? 
  It is necessary to indicate that the budget process begins 
several months before the end of the fiscal year so cash balance 
estimates are subject to variations and adjustments, especially 
during the last two months of the year when public agencies 
expedite their bids and requests for the submission of prices, 
as well as the issuance of contracts and payments. 
  The 1994 budget included an estimated cash and bank balance 
of $96.2 million, but this did not happen. The fiscal year which 
ended on 31 December 1993 showed a cash and bank balance of 
$16.6 million, which immediately results in a budget shortage as 
follows: 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Law No. 31, 12/31/94                                                         | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Cash and bank balance                 |$ 96.2 million                        | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Comptrollership General of the Republic, 31/12/93                            | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Budget shortage                       |16.6 million                          | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Budget deficit or shortage            |$ 79.6 million                        | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  4. How is the 12/31/93 cash balance determined? 
  We have implemented strict expense controls since we assumed 
the post of comptroller, without affecting government 
operations. By 10 December, we had a projected deficit of $28.4 
million for 31 December 1993. The measures we adopted include 
the following: 
  4.1 We canceled 1990, 1991, and 1992 purchase orders which 
had not been formally made. This represented $10.2 million in 
our books. 
  4.2 We also proceeded to annul the 1990, 1991, and 1992 
budget reserves. This represented $23.2 million in our books. 
  4.3 Additional contributions to the 1993 budget came from 
IPAT [Panamanian Tourism Institute], the National Beneficent 
Lottery, and the National Mortgage Bank. 
  4.4 Savings from November and December public expenses. 
  4.5 We continued to finance the 1993 cash and bank balance, 
$83.6 million, including government agencies' debts, which have 
yet to reimburse the central government for the amounts paid to 
the IFI's [International Financial Organizations] on their 
behalf. (Annex No. 3) 
  5. Why were all financial allotment requests not registered 
in 1993? 
  The comptrollership general received financial allotment 
requests, which were to be included in the 1993 fiscal year, 
from ministries and agencies and legislative projects for $72.9 
million. (Annex No. 4) 
  These reserve requests are listed as follows: 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Operation reserves                    |$ 13.2 million                        | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Investment reserves                   |59.7 million                          | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Logically, the $72.9 million could not be reserved. 
Therefore, the comptrollership general reserved the following: 
  -- Formally signed contracts. 
  -- Formally signed purchase orders. 
  -- Projects subject to public bids. 
  -- Subsidies to decentralized entities. 
  A total of $16.8 million were reserved for formally signed 
documents. 
  6. Why were all the legislators' projects not registered? 
  Legislators had submitted requests, through notes, to 
reserve 
$22.7 million for their "parliamentary initiatives." (Annex No. 
5, listed by legislator) 
  The reserves were not created because of the following 
reasons: 
  6.1 There were no documents on public bids. 
  6.2 There were no written requests for reserves. 
  6.3 If the reserves had been created, this would have 
resulted in a fiscal deficit which would have reduced the cash 
balance and increased the budget deficit for the 1994 fiscal 
year. 
  6.4 Legislators have the opportunity to request that their 
"parliamentary initiatives" be registered for the 1994 fiscal 
year. 
  7. What is the financial situation of the 1994 budget? 
  By not having the estimated cash balance of 96.2 million 
balboas and with a budget imbalance of 79.6 million balboas, the 
Comptroller General's Office has established the 1994 budget 
situation 11 months ahead of time, and is asking all ministers, 
deputy ministers, and all public institution directors and 
assistant directors to curb public spending, especially in the 
following areas: 
  Personnel (appointments and promotions). 
  Public services (Institute of Hydraulic Resources and 
Electrification, National Institute of Telecommunications, and 
National Water and Sanitation Institute). 
  Per diems and trips abroad. 
  Fuel. 
  8. What does execution of the investment budget depend on? 
  There is a structural problem in the Panamanian state's 
public finances. Panamanians do not save; the government does 
not [two previous words in upper case] save or collect 
sufficient income through taxes and its institutions are not 
profitable. Consequently, public investments must be financed by 
putting ourselves in debt and thereby increasing the debt 
service. 
  The central government's 1994 investment budget is 380.7 
million balboas, of which 318.9 balboas are from direct 
investments. How will these investments be financed? By putting 
ourselves more in debt. 
  According to estimates, the country will receive 324.3 
million balboas in foreign credit. It will be broken down as 
follows: 
  8.1 Conditional loans from IFI's, 183.9 million balboas. 
  8.2 Financing without conditions, 76.7 million balboas. 
  8.3 Agreements with foreign governments, 63.7 million 
balboas. 
  Mr. President, the question is: What will happen if this 
financing is not obtained as expected? Will we meet the IFI's 
requirements to obtain its disbursements? 
  9. What is the great responsibility of the Ministry of 
Treasury and Financing? 
  The central government's budget estimates current revenue 
collections will total 1.4158 billion balboas, which will be 
allocated to cover, along with other income, the central 
government's operating expenses, estimated at 1.5479 billion 
balboas. 
  What will happen if the Ministry of Finance and Treasury is 
unable to collected the budgeted amount? From now, this Ministry 
must take appropriate measures to avoid tax evasion, contraband, 
etc. so as to obtain the estimated current revenues. Otherwise, 
the 1994 deficit will increase. 
  10. The Public Debt Service 
  Whoever governs Panama in the future will face one of the 
most serious problems in public finances, the government, the 
economy, and the country in general. The public debt service. 
  The 1994 budget contemplates 493 million balboas for 
servicing the internal and external public debt. This figure, 
which is already high, does not include debt servicing of the 
San Jose Pact, Japanese and European bonds, or commercial banks. 
When agreements for restructuring the previously mentioned debts 
are achieved in the future, servicing the Panamanian public debt 
will be one of the most serious economic, financial, and fiscal 
problems for future leaders and the Panamanian people. The debt 
corresponds to the country and its inhabitants and not the 
administration that may be in office. 
  11. The important role of the MIPPE [Ministry of Planning 
and Economic Policy], Ministry of Finance and Treasury, and the 
Comptroller General's Office. 
  Article 147 of Law No. 32 establishes the following: If at 
any given time during the fiscal year, MIPPE, together with the 
Ministry of Finance and Treasury and the Comptroller General's 
Office, considers that revenues may be lower than the total 
expenses authorized in the government's budget, it will present 
a spending reduction plan before the Cabinet Council to avoid 
incurring a deficit. This presentation will be followed by 
appropriate legal actions, including the corresponding approval 
of the Legislative Assembly Budget Commission. This action, 
after approval has been duly granted, will be considered a 
modification to the state general budget, as set forth in 
Article 205. In light of this situation, we present, we think, 
Mr. President, that those of us who have the legal 
responsibility to take appropriate action must begin our task. 
  12. Can funds not used in 1993 be reallocated? 
  We suggest the remaining 1993 budget reserves, which were 
not 
used due to the aforementioned reasons, be considered for 
inclusion in the 1994 budget. This will allow them to be used so 
as to take advantage of the institutions' 1993 efforts. 
  13. Special 1994 credits against current revenues. 
  Given the 1994 financial situation, it is necessary to point 
out the limitations we are facing for addi?ional credits, whose 
financing will come from current revenues in 1994. Consequently, 
the Comptroller General's Office will not approve said credits 
if the current situation does not improve. 
  On this lengthy but necessary note, we wished to state, in 
detail, the fiscal situation, with the desire of observing the 
wise popular saying, which goes: "We must use only what we have 
at hand." 
  Respectfully and truly yours, 
  J. Chen Barria, Comptroller General

  [Text] The Panamanian Foreign Ministry today said it does 
not know anything about the alleged confiscation of assets of 
U.S. citizens residing in Panama -- confiscations that have been 
denounced by U.S. Senator Jesse Helms. Deputy Foreign Minister 
Carlos Cordero expressed surprise over the statement by Senator 
Helms, who accused the Panamanian Government of seizing assets 
of U.S. citizens. Cordero said the Panamanian Government will 
ask Jaime Ford, the Panamanian ambassador to the United States, 
to send information regarding the Republican senator's 
statements in an effort to clarify the situation. 
  [Begin recording] [Cordero] The Foreign Ministry has heard 
nothing about any seizures whatsoever. Nevertheless, we have 
asked Jaime Ford, our ambassador to the United States, to send 
us the transcripts of the statements made by Senator Helms in 
order that we can examine them. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Have you asked the U.S. Embassy in 
Panama for additional information to clarify this situation? 
  [Cordero] If deemed appropriate, and if the U.S. Embassy has 
any information which might shed some light on this situation, 
we will consider making such a request. [end recording] 
  According to the diplomat, Panama is interested in knowing 
the source of Helms' information. 
  [Begin Cordero recording] We want to examine his statement 
carefully and determine the source of the information he has 
disclosed before the U.S. Senate. [end recording]

  [Text] Panama City, 23 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- The European Union 
[EU] signed several cooperation agreements in Panama City today 
worth more than $2 million, which will be channeled to the 
Electoral Tribunal, Kuna Indians, and the Justice and Peace 
Commission. 
  Vittorio Alloco, EU ambassador to Central America, signed 
the 
agreements at a ceremony during which it was underscored the 
Central American region is the "first partner" of the 
development promotion policy being fostered from Brussels. The 
European diplomat said with more than 500 projects underway, 
worth more than $600 million, Central America is in first place, 
on a per capita base, among the regions the European aid is 
benefiting. 
  The Panamanian Electoral Tribunal will receive from the EU 
more than $500,000 to conduct a nationwide campaign to inform 
citizens about the new single-ballot voting system, which will 
be used for the first time in the upcoming 8 May general 
elections. 
  Electoral Tribunal President Eduardo Valdes has said the 
highest Panamanian electoral authority is also expecting 
complementary European aid to buy vehicles to be able to reach 
the remotest communities in the country. 
  The EU representative signed another agreement with Kuna 
"Indian Chief" Carlos Lopez to improve the traditional 
production sectors of the Indian communities and to promote 
sustainable development. 
  Another agreement was signed with the Justice and Peace 
Commission, which Stanley Muschett, Santa Maria La Antigua 
University president, heads. This agreement will enable the 
commission to conduct a poll during the elections. 
  The tour of the EU ambassador, who is headquartered in the 
Costa Rican capital, will end with the signing of another 
agreement with the Panamanian Foreign Ministry.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by Sever </F>
Plotzker in Davos on 29 January] 
  [Text] [Plotzker] Minister Peres, what is your reaction 
to 'Arafat's appeal to the United States to mediate between 
Israel and the PLO? 
  [Peres] We will in no way agree to U.S. mediation. This 
will freeze the entire process and bring us back to square one. 
  [Plotzker] Will we reject the mediation even if the price 
would be the collapse of the talks? 
  [Peres] We will not agree even if the result is a breakdown 
of the talks. Also, I believe that the Americans will not want 
to mediate. 
  [Plotzker] Why do you think 'Arafat opted for this? 
  [Peres] 'Arafat has been speaking about U.S. mediation for 
quite some time. The Palestinians fail to understand Israel's 
security problem. They believe we are a superpower. Our 
demands for adequate security arrangements on the bridges and 
border crossings fall on deaf ears. 
  [Plotzker] Can the Israeli stands be more flexible? 
  [Peres] It is not a question of flexibility. We signed the 
Oslo agreement; the Knesset approved it; the majority of the 
people supports it. We must implement it to the letter. If we 
agree to withdraw from the agreement, we would shatter the 
credibility of the peace process. Naturally, this would also 
contradict our real security needs, on which we insist. 
  [Plotzker] So, what it is going to be? Will the parties 
forever dig in their heels? 
  [Peres] Let me tell you something. The people involved in 
the Middle East peace process are no longer young; I speak of 
Israel's prime minister, myself, Mr. 'Arafat, King Husayn, and 
President al-Asad. It is very probable that the time has come 
for us to take some unpopular steps and make hard decisions -- 
because of our age -- to prepare the grounds for the younger 
generation. After all, in five to six years, the entire Middle 
East leadership could be different; a new generation will take 
the reins. The process is essential, and I am optimistic about 
this new generation. 
  [A report by Sever Plotzker on pages 1 and 15 of the same 
YEDI'OT AHARONOT edition adds that, arriving in Davos, Peres 
said: "If 'Arafat wants to bring in the United States as a 
mediator, he can forget about making progress in the peace 
process. We have not signed the Oslo and the mutual recognition 
agreements for this. Such an appeal places a giant obstacle on 
the road to progress."]

  [Excerpt] A senior political source has estimated that it 
would be difficult to attain practical agreements with Yasir 
'Arafat without making significant progress in the negotiations 
with Syria. According to the source, 'Arafat has been 
maneuvering the talks on a daily basis in order to avoid 
reaching a final agreement with Israel because his position as 
talks coordinator gives him much more influence than he would 
have once he assumes control over Gaza and Jericho, and the 
problems this entails. The political source believes that once 
Israel reaches a significant understanding with Syria, 'Arafat 
would rush to conclude all the issues in dispute because he 
understands that after the agreement with Syria is made, 
agreements with Jordan and Lebanon will immediately follow, and 
the PLO might find itself deserted and with no international 
support. 
  Another senior Israeli source who participates in the 
negotiations with the Palestinians also believes that Syria is 
the key to progress on all tracks. He maintains that only an 
agreement with Damascus will guarantee that the Rabin 
government's peace policy will become an irreversible situation. 
According to him, the government will not cross the "point of 
no return," as long as the conflict between Israel and Syria 
remains the same. This could lead to a situation in which, if a 
right-wing government comes to power in Israel, it could pull 
out of the peace process. 
  The foreign minister's entourage in Davos expressed 
satisfaction in view of the various public opinion polls 
published in Israel regarding a possible peace agreement with 
Syria. The polls, conducted by YEDI'OT AHARONOT and MA'ARIV, 
show a significant majority opposing a withdrawal on the Golan 
Heights. Peres' men, however, claim that the polls were held 
before any agreement on security arrangements has been made, and 
before a public relations campaign explaining the advantages of 
peace with Syria was held. The fact that more than 30 percent 
support a full withdrawal and another 30 percent support a 
partial withdrawal indicates that the government will not find 
it hard to attain the support of a very large majority for the 
agreement -- if and when a referendum is held on this subject. 
Peres himself had stressed that holding a referendum is still 
only an option. 
  Several officials in Davos have asked why Israel does not 
start discussing the permanent arrangements with the 
Palestinians and, instead engages in discussing border crossings 
arrangements which, in any event, will only last for a short 
period. The senior source said in response that the main reason 
why Israel drafted the Oslo agreement as it is pertains to the 
issue of Jerusalem. 
  According to the source, if Israel were to deal with the 
permanent arrangements at this time, the talks would have 
encountered serious difficulties over the Jerusalem issue. 
  The source stressed that, although the government enjoys the 
support of the majority of the Israeli public, "there are issues 
on which the majority is not sufficiently large, and it would 
not be wise to turn large parts of the public against the 
government." 
  The source used the same argument regarding the issue of 
evacuating the isolated settlements of Netzarim and Kfar Darom 
in the Gaza Strip. A government source who is not a Foreign 
Ministry official stressed that although the issue in question 
refers to several dozen families -- the defense of which would 
entail the deploying a large number of IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] troops and controlling the roads in the very crowded 
Gaza Strip -- Israel must show that it insists that the Oslo 
agreement be fully honored. According to him, the agreement that 
will be signed with the Palestinians is just the first in a 
series of agreements which will be made in the near future, and 
it is important to establish the principle that signed 
agreements should not be reopened. 
  At the same time, sources in Davos expressed the possibility 
that, after the parties sign the agreement on the transfer of 
authorities, Israel may unilaterally decide to disband certain 
settlements. The sources stressed that this decision will be 
made by Israel alone, based on Israeli interests, and not in the 
framework of the negotiations with the PLO. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The PLO and Israeli delegations in Davos last night 
issued a joint communique stating that the first meeting between 
the two parties was conducted in a very positive atmosphere 
which indicated good chances for future progress. Both 
delegations established a joint formulations committee which 
held its first meeting last night. This committee will continue 
work this morning. The formulations committee will deal with the 
major issues currently on the agenda: the implementation of the 
Gaza-Jericho First agreement and the issue of the border 
crossings. This morning, the committee will report to the 
plenum on the results of the discussions. The members of the 
formulations committee are Nabil Sha'th, Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad 
Quray'], and Akram Haniyah, on behalf of the PLO, and its 
Israeli members are Uri Savir, Major General 'Uzi Dayan, and 
Yo'el Singer. 
  Minister Yosi Sarid warned against excessive optimism and 
explained that there were still gaps between the parties' 
positions. Sarid said that it would only be possible this 
evening to know whether an agreement had been reached. 
  Last night, Yasir 'Arafat and Shim'on Peres held a private 
meeting which lasted approximately two hours.

  [Text] The meeting of Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and 
PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat in Davos -- also attended by Minister 
Yosi Sarid and Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa -- has ended. 
After the meeting 'Arafat said that not all the problems were 
solved, but he expects an agreement soon. Yosi Sarid said there 
are ups and downs; agreement was achieved on some issues and now 
we are closer to an agreement. Arab sources told our 
correspondent Gid'on Kouts that for all intents and purposes an 
agreement has been achieved, except for some minor issues. 
Israeli members in the formulations committee said that 
understandings were reached on all issues; the two sides made 
concessions and there is a chance for reaching an agreement. 
  Foreign Minister Peres will stay in Davos until tomorrow 
morning. The contacts will be carried on tonight.

  [Text] Davos, Switzerland, Jan 30 (AFP) -- Israel and the 
PLO appeared moving toward a breakthrough Sunday [30 January] in 
talks on Palestinian autonomy with the PLO accepting a 
compromise proposal hammered out by negotiators overnight. 
  Working groups laboured through the night and morning hours 
to nail down details of the Israeli withdrawal from the West 
Bank town of Jericho and Gaza Strip under an accord signed in 
September. 
  'Abd-Rabbuh, a spokesman for the Palestine Liberation 
Organisation, told reporters in this Alpine resort town that 
there was now a compromise on the table and "we accept it." 
  He would not give details of the proposal or say explicitly 
whether the Israelis accepted it. But he added, "I can't say 
that there is any problem holding up an agreement." 
  Israeli officials were not immediately available for 
comment. 
Israeli sources said the proposal was being transmitted to Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. 
  Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, who had lengthy 
talks 
with PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat late Saturday and was to meet with 
him again outside the World Economic Forum here, was asked 
earlier if they were close to a breakthrough. "Closer than 
yesterday," he replied. 
  He told reporters the two hours of discussions he had with 
'Arafat at their hotel here Saturday were constructive but he 
refused to say whether they would produce an accord. 
  'Arafat declined to comment on progress, telling reporters 
at 
the hotel where he and Peres were staying: "You will have to 
wait." 
  "Yesterday it was going well and we hope today we continue 
on 
the same lines," 'Arafat said. 
  Israeli Environment Minister Yosi Sarid said the working 
groups of negotiators met until 3 a.m. (0200 GMT) Sunday and 
resumed at about 7 a.m (0600 GMT). He said they would continue 
their work and then 'Arafat and Peres and full delegations would 
meet again. 
  Asked about progress he said: "As long as documents are not 
being signed, I don't want to speculate about progress." 
  Peres is due to fly out Sunday night for Washington. But 
when asked if he was leaving Sunday night, he only said: "Maybe." 
  'Arafat had said at the start of his discussions with Peres, 
their first since a meeting in Oslo a week ago, that they hoped 
to get an accord here or at least "a main platform for an 
agreement." 
  Peres had added: "There are serious differences between the 
parties, but we are here with serious intentions. We will do 
all that is possible to answer hopes for peace." 
  Under an agreement signed on the White House lawn on 
September 13, the Israelis were to have started a four-month 
withdrawal of their troops from Jericho and the Gaza Strip on 
December 13. 
  But Israel and the PLO have been wrangling over who should 
control border crossings with neighbouring Jordan and Egypt, the 
size of the Jericho autonomous area and security for Jewish 
settlements. 
  Sarid had said earlier that if there was an agreement later 
Sunday it would focus on the size of the Jericho and Gaza 
autonomous areas as well as on the border crossings but leave 
many other issues still to be resolved, such as the status of 
Palestinian authority and administrative arrangements in the two 
areas. 
  "There are many legal questions which we have not even 
discussed," Sarid said. 
  'Arafat had arrived from Tunisia on Saturday after appealing 
to US President Bill Clinton for help in ending the impasse 
which he blamed on the Israelis. He made the same request of 
British Prime Minister John Major on Friday.

  [Text] Israeli and Palestinian spokesmen in Switzerland 
are now saying that progress has been made in the discussions 
towards reaching a compromise between the parties. PLO official 
Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh told our correspondent in Davos, Gid'on Kouts, 
that the representatives of both parties in the formulations 
committee had accepted the compromise after making difficult 
concessions. According to the Palestinian sources, the 
formulated proposals were sent to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
who will decide whether or not to accept them. Our 
correspondent notes that Foreign Minister Peres telephoned Mr. 
Rabin several times today from Switzerland. Apparently, an 
agreement has been reached on the issue of the border crossings 
and on the size of the Jericho area; however, the parties still 
disagree over the matter of the security zones and roads in the 
Gaza Strip. Israeli sources confirmed that significant progress 
had indeed been made in the talks. The sources nevertheless 
stressed that there had already been instances in the past when 
everything fell apart at the last moment. Egyptian Foreign 
Minister 'Amr Musa, who is mediating between the Palestinians 
and the Israelis, expressed great optimism. Minister Musa met 
with Yasir 'Arafat several times over the past 24 hours. 
Shim'on Peres and Yasir 'Arafat will meet later today at a 
luncheon on behalf of the international economic forum meeting 
at Davos.

  [Text] Davos, Switzerland, Jan 30 (AFP) -- Israel and the 
PLO will have a final agreement "very soon" to launch 
Palestinian autonomy in the occupied territories, PLO chief 
Yasir 'Arafat said Sunday [30 January]. 
  He made his remarks at the World Economic Forum here amid 
two 
days of intense talks between delegations headed by 'Arafat and 
Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in this Alpine resort 
town. 
  But there was no clear sign how much of a breakthrough the 
two sides had made in stalled negotiations on the withdrawal of 
Israeli troops from the West Bank town of Jericho and the Gaza 
Strip. 
  Only minutes before addressing the forum, 'Arafat said when 
asked if progress had been made: "Not yet." 
  Peres, who was also participating in a panel discussion on 
the Middle East here, pledged efforts to make peace but made no 
specific reference to the talks here. 
  'Arafat told the forum he and Peres had "very important and 
constructive talks" on ending the impasse over details of their 
September agreement to launch limited Palestinian self-rule in 
the two areas. 
  "We can say we are on our way to bypassing all the obstacles 
which had been raised in the last weeks to have very soon the 
final agreement to start direct implementation of the peace 
agreement," he said. 
  The PLO chief said he hoped to have an agreement signed soon 
in Cairo and Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa announced 
President Husni Mubarak had invited the two parties for the 
signing. No date was mentioned. 
  Musa said the discussions made "definite progress that paved 
the way for the implementation of the agreement signed a few 
months ago." He said negotiations would continue after the 
Davos talks. 
  Earlier, a spokesman for the Palestine Liberation 
Organisation said the PLO had accepted a compromise hammered out 
overnight by a working committee of negotiators from both sides. 
  The compromise centred on the size of the autonomous Jericho 
area, Israeli radio reported. It also said Israel accepted for 
the first time to have corridors linking Jericho and three holy 
sites in the Jordan valley. 
  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin was studying the 
proposal in Jerusalem but there was no word on any progress on 
the key issue of who would control international border 
crossings. 
  Israeli officials cautioned any progress here would not 
cover 
all disputes holding up the Israeli withdrawal from Jericho and 
Gaza, which was to have started December 13 and be completed 
four months later. 
  "We were not supposed to sign anything today," Peres said at 
the well-guarded luxury hotel where he and 'Arafat were staying 
and negotiating. 
  "We are trying to overcome the remaining problems and that's 
what we are doing," said Peres, who met with 'Arafat late 
Saturday and had two more sessions with him Sunday in the 
presence of Musa. 
  Israeli Environment Minister Yosi Sarid cautioned that even 
if some of the key details were ironed out here, several other 
points remained to be resolved. 
  Among them were the status of Palestinian authority and 
administrative arrangements in the two areas after the Israeli 
pullout. "There are many legal questions which we have not even 
discussed," Sarid said. 
  Before the talks opened here, both sides had played down 
chances for significant progress. But the atmosphere appeared 
warm from the start, and 'Arafat said early on that they hoped 
to get an accord in Davos or at least "a main platform for an 
agreement." 
  Peres was originally scheduled to fly to the United States 
later Sunday. Asked if he was sticking to the plan, he said 
only "maybe," leaving open the possibility of another day of 
talks. 
  'Arafat was to leave Monday for a trip to Bern at the 
invitation of the Swiss government and then continue to Geneva 
to speak to the UN Commission on Human Rights.

Our correspondent reports that differences of opinion remain 
only on the Jericho area issue. On the issue of the border 
crossings it was agreed that a Palestinian attorney will be 
permitted to attend the interrogation of suspects detained at 
the crossings. 
  The Davos negotiations will continue this evening at a 
junior 
level. Peres and 'Arafat will intervene if called to do so. 
Minister Peres will leave Davos tomorrow morning.

  [Text] Davos, Switzerland, Jan 30 (AFP) -- Israel and the 
PLO have cleared away virtually all obstacles to a final 
agreement on Palestinian autonomy and will sign an accord in 10 
days, Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa said here Sunday [30 
January]. 
  "This is really the final stage," said Musa, who took part 
in 
two days of intensive talks here between PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat 
and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. 
  "Next time they meet will be in Cairo to sign the 
agreement," 
he said. Asked when this would be, he replied: "Within the next 
10 days." 
  Musa said discussions would continue in this Alpine resort 
town on the final details of arrangements for the withdrawal of 
Israeli troops from the West Bank town of Jericho and the Gaza 
Strip. 
  "It is just a question of finessing some points. The way is 
clear for an agreement. There is no major issue between them 
anymore," he said. 
  Musa said the sticky question of who would man international 
border control points had been resolved with agreement that 
Israeli border guards would be deployed, but out of sight of 
travelers. 
  'Arafat told the World Economic Forum that an agreement 
would 
be signed "very soon" in Cairo. But there was no confirmation 
from the Israeli side, and Peres said only he was "hopeful" of 
an agreement.

Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh in Davos, by MBC Anchorman Antoine 'Awn in 
London, "few minutes ago"--recorded] 
  [Text] ['Abd-Rabbuh] In fact, discussions continue up to 
this moment. I believe that these negotiations could reach 
agreement over some points, but not all of them during this 
round. Discussions revolve around the issue of the crossings, 
the Jericho area, and the settlements in Gaza. There is some 
slow and simple progress in these points. We are now working on 
finding a joint formula on the things we have managed to agree 
on. There are still some difficulties. I believe that if all 
points are not addressed during this round, we could discuss 
them in Cairo to finalize our agreement. 
  ['Awn] Mr. Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, on what level will discussions 
in Cairo take place? On President 'Arafat's level? 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] I do not think so. Before we reach 
discussions on the level of President 'Arafat and Prime Minister 
Rabin, we need to be very close to finalizing the agreement in 
its broad outlines and even its essential details. Therefore, 
what we agree on now will form a part of the agreement that we 
must finalize at a later date. 
  ['Awn] Mr. Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, thank you. 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] I thank you.

  [Text] Shim'on Peres and Yasir 'Arafat are slated to meet 
in Davos at the present time. Our correspondent Gid'on Kouts 
reports that the Israeli-Palestinian formulations committee 
completed its work and has reached a written document. Israeli 
sources in Davos say that if the document is approved by Yitzhaq 
Rabin and Yasir 'Arafat an agreement will be reached. Sources 
in the Palestinian delegation say, on the other hand, that some 
problems remain and the Israelis are retreating from promises 
they have made. 
  The document includes mutually agreed-upon positions as well 
as the positions of each of the two sides. It was reported that 
agreement has been reached on the sterile room at the border 
crossings, as well as on the issues of security roads and zones 
in the Gaza Strip. On the other hand there is only a basic 
understanding regarding the size of the Jericho area; a 
gentleman's agreement has been reached that Israel will increase 
this size as a goodwill gesture. 
  The Israeli sources assessed that the agreement will not be 
initialed tonight. 
  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres told our correspondent that 
if 
everything is concluded this will constitute a major step toward 
implementing the agreement of principles. Peres would not 
commit himself to deadlines and dates for the implementation of 
the agreement of principles, but said that if an agreement is 
reached the road will be greatly shortened. He added that every 
side has remained faithful to its principles: Israel made no 
concessions on security issues, whereas the Palestinians 
insisted on issues relating to their self-respect and sentiments.

  [Text] Cairo, 30 Jan (MENA)--Informed diplomatic sources 
have stated that during their meeting in Davos, Switzerland, the 
Palestinian delegation led by Yasir 'Arafat and the Israeli 
delegation led by Shim'on Peres have agreed on 12 points that 
were sources of disagreement. In a statement to MENA, these 
sources said that among the points on which they agreed is 
allowing a Palestinian police presence at the crossing points 
between Gaza, Jericho, and Jordan, and the flying of the 
Palestinian flag at the crossing points that lead to Gaza and 
Jericho. They also agreed to jointly search goods passing 
through the crossing points, to establish Palestinian projects 
by the Dead Sea, on joint Palestinian-Israeli projects, and to 
set up a crossing in the al-Maghtas area [site where Jesus 
Christ is believed to have been baptized] and raise the 
Palestinian flag in the area on certain occasions. 
  These sources also said that among the 12 points of 
agreement 
is that the security belt of Israeli settlements in the Gaza 
Strip should be 36 km long. They also agreed on the presence of 
joint Palestinian-Israeli security control on roads in Gaza and 
Jericho and to have joint patrols on the borders. These sources 
said that defining the size of Jericho's area was left to the 
Israeli side [words indistinct] a size of 54 kms. The sources 
expect the two sides to sign the points of agreement they 
reached in Cairo soon.

  [Excerpts] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and PLO Chairman 
Yasir 'Arafat will meet in Cairo on Sunday [6 February]. After 
a further round of talks in Switzerland last night, Peres said 
he was optimistic that the differences between the two sides can 
be bridged before next week's meeting, where it is hoped an 
agreement on implementing the Gaza-Jericho First plan can be 
signed. Mark Weiss reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Weiss] [passage omitted] Addressing the 
economic forum, Foreign Minister Peres had this message for 
Yasir 'Arafat: 
  [Peres] May I tell Chairman 'Arafat, who himself 
personalizes the great suffering of the Palestinian people, that 
we on our side, on the Israeli side, are decided to enable as 
much as it depends on us to make the Palestinian story a story 
of success. 
  [Weiss] Peres praised 'Arafat's determination to reach 
agreement and said that although both sides had compromised, 
Israel had made no concessions on security issues. [passage

  [Excerpt] This morning, Brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], 
president of the state of Palestine and PLO Executive Committee 
chairman, received Mr. John McCarthy, the ambassador of the 
United States in Tunis. During the meeting a discussion took 
place covering the latest developments in the 
Palestinian-Israeli negotiating process and the deadlock it has 
reached as a result of the obstacles placed by Israel in the way 
of implementing the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of 
Principles agreement. 
  Brother President Abu-'Ammar has sent an appeal to U.S. 
President Bill Clinton asking him to intervene, as the agreement 
was reached under his auspices. Brother President Abu-'Ammar 
also asked for the intervention of the United States in its 
capacity as one of the two co-chairmen of the peace talks, in 
order to overcome the deadlock in the negotiations and attain 
the accurate and faithful implementation of the provisions that 
were approved in Washington. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Tawfiq 'Abid] </F>
  [Text] An informed Palestinian source in Amman has stated 
that security issues have hindered reaching a 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement in Cairo. The source added that 
the extent of security measures at the bridges and inspection 
points and Israel's powers in this regard took 36 hours of 
fruitless discussions. 
  The source told AL-DUSTUR that the Israelis insist on 
putting 
an observer at the crossings who will have the right to talk to 
and interrogate those who arrive at and those who leave the 
crossings prepared for the residents of Gaza and Jericho. This 
constituted a departure from their previous stands by which they 
demanded a special crossing which will be subjected to remote 
electronic surveillance, he said. 
  The source said: A new condition has been presented over the 
past two days by the negotiating delegation dispatched by Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. The Israeli condition is that the 
Israelis should have the right to interrogate directly and 
independently every suspect and to search him thoroughly without 
interference from the Palestinian authorities. 
  The source added: The Israeli delegation was very 
uncompromising concerning basic issues on the agenda in an 
attempt to transfer controversial issues to the ['Arafat-Peres] 
Davos meeting in Switzerland. 
  Answering a question, the source said: The 12 points of 
difference have been reduced to four after difficult sessions of 
negotiations. However, the remaining issues are more important 
and complicated and we do not know if the Davos meeting will 
succeed in tackling them. 
  The source said: Differences over the Jericho area are still 
continuing but the Israelis have agreed on a compromise giving 
the Palestinian side special "passageways" to the Dead Sea, 
al-Nabi Musa, al-Maghtis, and the River Jordan without Israeli 
interference in order to prevent any connection between Jericho 
and Jordan. [sentence as published] 
  AL-DUSTUR has learned that the Israeli side proposed "joint 
investments" in the area located between Jericho and the Dead 
Sea but the Palestinian position on this proposal has not yet 
been revealed. 
  The source said: The Israelis went back on their agreement 
to have a symbolic Palestinian presence on the entry posts to 
the West Bank--a policeman or a flag--and presented to us a new 
stand pertaining to a symbolic Palestinian presence immediately 
after, and not at, the entrance of the bridge. 
  Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa carried positive signals 
from his Israeli counterpart after a brief visit to Tel Aviv 
four days ago dealing with basic issues in general and 
recommending compromise solutions, but these signals disappeared 
at the negotiating table and the Israeli side appeared to be 
most uncompromising.

<F P=106> [Interview with PLO dissident Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi by </F>
KNACK; place and date not given: "`Democracy Is a Process' -- 
An Interview with Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, the Old Man of Gaza 
and Former Leader of the Palestinian Delegation in Madrid"; 
first paragraph is KNACK introduction] 
  [Text] Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi resigned as the leader of 
the Palestinian negotiating team in Washington when the Oslo 
agreement came to light. He is probably the most respected man 
in Gaza and very popular as a dissident within the PLO. 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] The peace agreement leaves many things to be 
desired, but its most important fault is that it does not 
question Israeli claims on the occupied territories. Also, it 
says nothing about the colonization process in Jerusalem and 
elsewhere. The Israelis claimed right from the start that this 
territory was Israeli territory. That is why they called the 
1967 war a "war of liberation." That has remained like that: 
They have never admitted that they were occupiers. And that 
means that they have claims on the occupied territories. The 
fact that this agreement does not cover this aspect, and does 
not ask Israel to give up these claims, is its big fault. They 
are actively colonizing Jerusalem, despite the agreement which 
says that Jerusalem will come on the agenda in the final phase 
of the negotiations. 
  In other words, Jerusalem has been virtually given up to the 
Israeli side. Nothing was said about the settlements -- there 
is a silent agreement on two different entities in the occupied 
territories. Firstly the Israeli entity, which is the 
"settlers," and secondly the Palestinian entity, with separate 
administrative and legal systems. 
  This, too, will lead to major obstacles for us, on our way 
to 
our long-term goal, which is our own independent state. 
  [KNACK] Do you not believe that in a later phase of the 
process the "settlers" would be sent back anyway? 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] Now, in the interim period, they could at 
the 
very least have given positive signs that the final outcome was 
still open for discussion. But all that Israel is doing at 
present is further reducing the credibility of that agreement on 
the ultimate solution. As I said back in Madrid, the 
settlements are not compatible with peace. Even James Baker 
agreed. 
  [KNACK] You and others have signed a text which was sent to 
the PLO leadership in Tunis ... 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] That was a memorandum on democratic 
practice. 
After the agreement became fact, we wanted at least to be able 
to work democratically in managing our own affairs in the areas 
which will be transferred. We are certainly against 'Arafat 
remaining the only source of decisions. Therefore, we are 
asking for a broad basis to the decision making process, we are 
asking the Executive Committee to work as a collective 
leadership, we want competence and quality to not be sacrificed 
to political and personal considerations, things in that line ... 
  [KNACK] Here in Gaza, the people are worried about a 
possible 
dictatorial regime which 'Arafat might bring from Tunis ... 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] Look, if we are going to manage our own 
affairs, then it is no more than normal that we ask that type of 
question. You should not read too much into that. An 
administration which meets the people's needs must be 
constructed along democratic lines: accountability, 
transparency and so on. The people are worried, they want to be 
certain that this is what it will actually become. 
  [KNACK] How do you see such a democracy? In the past you 
refused to lead an opposition party in the name of Palestinian 
unity. 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] It is still too early to talk about that. I 
do know that pluralism is one of the aspects of democracy. If 
we organize our own society, in the context of freedom and 
independence and the rest, then pluralism will certainly be a 
part of it. But now we are thinking about that broad basis for 
the decision making process and collective leadership. I hope 
that the elections in July are orderly and produce an elected 
leadership which itself will work democratically. But real 
democracy is still a way off. You cannot just give or take 
democracy, democracy is a process. 
  [KNACK] Do you think that the peace agreement can 
nevertheless have positive results? 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] I hope that we will manage our affairs 
competently and thus prove that we are capable of doing so. 
That is very important. That does not mean that we must forget 
the things which are not covered in this agreement. 
  [KNACK] Do you believe that the leadership in Tunis can 
democratize itself? 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] Democracy can only be achieved in an 
atmosphere of freedom and independence. What we are thinking 
about now -- a collective leadership and the like -- is possible 
because the Executive Committee is made up of representatives of 
the different groups. If they introduce a spirit of democracy, 
then it will become an example of democratic practice. That 
would be meaningful in the present circumstances, and then the 
practice of the Palestinian National Council and the Central 
Committee could be democratized. That would be reflected in the 
behavior of representatives of the leadership who are appointed 
for the duration of the interim period. It is a process which 
creates its own dynamic, but first it must start. 
  [KNACK] So won't it again be 'Arafat who decides to launch 
democratization? 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] No, it does not have to be that way. If the 
group of delegates has the will to push this through, then it 
can do so.

  [Text] Paris, Jan 28 (AFP) -- The World Bank's 
consultative group on development of the West Bank and Gaza 
decided Friday [January 28] to grant budgetary aid on behalf of 
Palestinian autonomy for this year, the World Bank announced in 
Paris. 
  It said the group members would provide "more than 120 
million dollars to cover the budget deficit of 158 million 
dollars" in connection with Palestinian autonomy this year. 
  The donors -- including the European Community, the United 
States, Japan and some Arab countries -- also agreed to the 
broad outlines of expenditures and receipts contained in the 
first Palestinian budget, developed by the Palestinian Economic 
Council for Reconstruction and Development, the announcement 
said. 
  The consultative group, grouping 24 countries and five 
international institutions, was supposed to cover the entire 
budget deficit. Palestinian delegation head Nabil Kassir told 
correspondents that "We did not get everything we need to ensure 
economic stability. But we did not come out so badly." 
  The donors' meeting was held Thursday and Friday at the 
World 
Bank's European headquarters in Paris.

Palestinian national. The source added that Israel might use 
him as a bargaining chip in the ongoing PLO-Israeli negotiations. 
  The source went on to say: The Tunisian authorities, which 
interrogated this agent after unearthing his espionage 
activities, do not intend to extradite him to Israel. Any 
decision in this regard is bound to be influenced by the 
Palestinian leadership's calculations regarding this issue, the 
source noted.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Awdah 'Awdah] </F>
  [Text] The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine 
[PFLP] has denied that it is about to move its headquarters from 
Damascus to Baghdad. 
  The PFLP and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine [DFLP], as well as other factions, moved their 
headquarters from Beirut to Damascus after the Palestinian 
resistance evacuated Beirut in September 1982, while Fatah and 
other factions moved from Beirut to Tunis. 
  Following his return from Baghdad a few days ago, PFLP 
Political Bureau member 'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh told AL-RA'Y that 
the PFLP delegation's visit to Baghdad had nothing to do with 
this subject, and said the PFLP's main office is still in 
Damascus. 
  Malluh denied that the opposition factions, including the 
PFLP, are facing harassment by the Syrian leadership. 
  He described the press reports published by London 
newspapers 
on moving the PFLP headquarters from Damascus to Baghdad as 
completely untrue, and said the front has the right to be 
present in the Arab states bordering Palestine. 
  He said that cooperation and coordination between the 
Palestinian opposition forces and the Syrian leadership 
continue, based on their position which calls for full Israeli 
withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian and Arab territories, 
and their joint position on the dangers of self-rule because it 
is unfair to the Palestinian national rights. 
  Meanwhile, a DFLP official said he expects a DFLP delegation 
to visit the Iraqi capital within 10 days. DFLP Political 
Bureau member Saji Salamah denied any intention to move the 
front's headquarters from Damascus to Baghdad, and emphasized 
that the DFLP delegation's visit to Baghdad had been decided a 
long time ago. 
  The visits by the PFLP and DFLP delegations to Baghdad are 
the first since the Syrian-U.S. summit in Geneva. 
  Fatah and other factions have announced that they will move 
their headquarters to the self-rule region after Israel's 
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, expected to be completed next 
April.

<F P=106> [Report by Yosi Torpstein] </F>
  [Excerpt] A seminar on democracy and human rights 
organized by the Center for the Protection of Liberties, 
identified with the Democratic Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine [DFLP], has, for the first time ever, decided to 
establish a committee in the territories to monitor human rights 
violations against Palestinians by fellow Palestinians. 
  Presenting the idea, Dr. Mahmad Jadallah, one of the most 
prominent DFLP activists, said that in view of the feared human 
rights violations against Palestinians not only by Israel but 
also by the Palestinian national government that will be 
established in the territories, "someone must try to stop 
irregularities and violations of human rights by Palestinians, 
even if this is only done by words." 
  The seminar, held yesterday at the al-Watani Hotel in East 
Jerusalem, dealt with issues on the current agenda of 
Palestinian society involving its fears with regard to the 
future. Among other things, the participants discussed 
relations between the individual and the Palestinian government 
that will be established in the territories, the status and role 
of human rights watch organizations in relation to that 
government, the status of Palestinian women, and the proposed 
constitution for the Palestinian government. 
  In the discussions, sharp criticism was leveled at the PLO 
leadership for signing the Oslo agreement; for its lack of 
awareness of the need to teach democratic values in schools and 
other institutions; and for other negative phenomena in the 
territories, such as the murder of innocent people. [passage

<F P=106> [By a JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>
  [Text] Amman--The Abu-Nidal group has applied to join a 
Palestinian alliance opposed to the moderate strategies of 
Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, 
and the factions in the Damascus-based coalition appeared to be 
split over the issue, informed sources said Saturday [29 
January]. 
  The Abu-Nidal [group], formally calling itself Fatah 
Revolutionary Council (FRC), renewed its bid to join the 
alliance after the coalition named a 20-member leadership 
council on Jan. 19, the sources said. An earlier FRC bid to 
join the alliance, when it was first created as a loose umbrella 
in September 1992, was turned down. 
  According to the sources, the Democratic Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) of Nayif Hawatimah oppose any 
membership for the Abu-Nidal group in the alliance. It is 
citing the numerous attacks on PLO officials claimed or 
attributed to the Abu-Nidal group and objecting its entry into 
the alliance, they said. 
  "Abu-Nidal's hands are stained with Palestinian blood, and 
he 
has no place in a Palestinian nationalist group," according to a 
senior DFLP official. 
  The DFLP also argues that the presence of the FRC in the 
alliance would be insignificant in view of the small size of the 
group. It is estimated that the Abu-Nidal group has less than 
200 members scattered around in the Arab World, but mainly in 
Lebanon. 
  The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, believes tht the FRC 
should be given a chance to enter the coalition if it publicly 
accepts the principles of the alliance and pledges to abide by 
them, according to the sources. 
  Hamas, which claims to be the largest faction in the 
10-group 
alliance, also believes that any decision on the FRC bid for 
membership should be decided by the leadership council, which is 
scheduled to meet in early February in Damascus to elect a 
president, they said. 
  Other leading groups in the alliance include the Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP); dissident wings of 
Fatah, the main-stream group of Mr. 'Arafat; the Communist Party 
and the Palestine Liberation Front are also members in addition 
to Lebanon-based factions such as Islamic Jihad-Palestine and 
Hizballah- Palestine. Their views on the FRC bid were not known 
immediately. 
  The leadership council is made up of two members each from 
the 10 groups. 
  Abu-Nidal, whose real name is Sabri al-Banna, is one of the 
most wanted men in the world. His group has been blamed for a 
series of violent attacks in the Middle East and Europe, 
including the 1986 attacks at Rome and Vienna airports which 
killed more than 20 people. 
  Abu-Nidal was expelled from Syria in the late 80s. His group 
was believed to have moved to Libya and stayed there for a few 
years before the Tripoli government launched a crackdown on the 
group in 1990-91. 
  Several leading activists of the group were reported to have 
been killed in a bitter power struggle while it was based in 
Libya.

  [Text] Fatah has narrowly won the elections to the Gaza 
Strip Engineers Association, which will now be headed by a Fatah 
representative, with a deputy from the Islamic list. The 
executive committee will be run by a Fatah majority, but next 
year the Islamic list will have a majority. This arrangement 
was dictated by the need to rotate one seat. 
  Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that since the Islamic 
movements have traditionally held a majority in the Engineers 
Association, the Gaza Strip Fatah chapter views the election 
results as a victory.

  [Text] Gentlemen: Did our people back the wrong side in 
the major and historic Mother of Battles? Are a certain people 
at fault if they take their own side, trench, and active 
weapons? Our people from all walks of life and across the 
political spectrum took a worthy stand throughout the Mother of 
Battles. Our people tilted toward truth and that continues to 
be the case. They continue to be in truth's fighting trenches, 
in the battalions of the camp of justice and the faithful led by 
the mujahid leader President Saddam Husayn. 
  Anyone who wants to speak on behalf of the Palestinian 
people 
must utter only that which truly represents their position and 
militant march on the road of freedom and the Arab character of 
the homeland. 
  The Saudi Arabian regime -- mired in treason, ignominy, and 
subordination, and, having leased Arab territory and tradition 
in the Arabian Peninsula to invaders -- is not a custodian of 
our people. Nor is it the right party to issue certificates of 
good conduct and inflict punishment. 
  Anyone who will apologize for our people's distinguished 
stand during the Mother of battles and their taking Iraq's side 
only speaks for his own ignominiousness. Such a person has no 
right to claim he is speaking in the name of or representing our 
people. Our militant people, who were unanimous in their 
support for Iraq in the Mother of Battles, knew then and are 
still convinced that the position they took was the right one. 
Our people will take the same position and sit in the same 
trench in all the Arab nation's battles and honorable pages of 
glory. All Saudi Arabia's money that has been withheld from our 
people, revolutionaries, and our valiant intifadah, and diverted 
to foot the bills of aggression on the Arab nation, cannot buy 
the consciences of the Palestinian people and their decisive, 
historic stands. This is because our people are too good to be 
bribed with ill-gotten money that has hurt and bankrolled 
aggression on the Arab nation. Our people will not stand for an 
apology. Our people will never apologize for taking their own 
side and trench and honorable history.

<F P=106> [All names as received] </F>
  [Text] Algiers, Jan 30 (AFP) -- General Liamine Zeroual, 
the career soldier co-opted Sunday by the High Security Council 
(HCS) to lead Algeria through three years of transition, is a 
veteran of the 1954-62 war of independence from France. 
  Now 53, the man with silver hair and a pepper-and-salt 
moustache emerged from three years in the wilderness last year 
to succeed Major-General Khaled Nezzar as defence minister. 
  Nezzar was widely considered the strongman of the five-man 
presidential college that has ruled since president Chadli 
Bendjedid resigned on January 11, 1992, shortly before the 
cancellation of the second round of a general election that the 
fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was set to win. 
  Zeroual has kept his forays into the public debate on the 
country's political future to a minimum. 
  But in two memorable statements on October 24 and January 
16, 
he warned that while the army remained neutral, it would not 
stand by passively in the face of dangerous developments that 
were threatening the fate of the nation. 
  His unscheduled televised broadcast on January 16, a vain 
attempt to galvanise the key political players into attending 
this week's abortive national conference, had the stamp of a 
presidential hopeful. 
  It had been hoped the conference could choose a new 
president, but in the absence of comprehensive participation, 
the task fell to the HCS. 
  In that televised speech, Zeroual called in firm and solemn 
tones for a "new national political system to enshrine true 
democracy, to guarantee all individual and collective freedoms 
and to put an end to political, economic, cultural and 
ideological monopolies." 
  He also called for a "complete break from the old style and 
methods of management." 
  Zeroual's army colleagues portray him as reserved and a man 
of principle. He resigned as commander of land forces and 
deputy chief-of-staff and quit the army in 1989 after clashing 
with Bendjedid about his plans for a military shake-up. 
  He was then named ambassador to Romania, but resigned after 
less than a year to get away from politics and spend time in his 
hometown. 
  After the assassination of caretaker president Mohammed 
Boudiaf on July 29, 1992, there were persistent rumours that he 
would be appointed interior minister or a kind of 
secretary-general of the five-man presidency. 
  But he got neither job, and it was much to the surprise of 
most people that he was appointed defence minister on July 3 
last year. 
  His appointment was seen as the army's way of inciting the 
politicians to reform the management of the civil service. 
  Zeroual, who advocates a professional army, has in his long 
career as a serving officer commanded the Tamanrasset military 
region in the extreme south of Algeria in 1982, Bechar on the 
Moroccan border in 1984 and Constantine in eastern Algeria in 
1987. 
  He has also commanded two of the army's training schools, 
including the Cherchel Academy, the nursery for the officer 
elite.

<F P=106> [Address to the nation by President Liamine Zeroual at his </F>
swearing-in ceremony--live relay] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. Your Excellency, the chairman [of the Higher 
State Council]; members of the Higher State Council; ladies and 
gentlemen: It is my duty at this historic moment solemnly to 
salute the souls of all our righteous sons who paid for the 
freedom and independence of Algeria and the unity and 
sovereignty of our nation with their lives. 
  I stand before you at a time when the homeland is going 
through a decisive turning point which makes it the duty of 
every Algerian citizen, male or female, to shoulder his 
responsibility and devote all of his forces in order to preserve 
the supreme interest of the homeland and secure the continuity 
of the Algerian state and the independence of its decision in 
faithfulness to the principles of the 1 November Revolution. 
  Not long ago my brothers called on me, from the highest 
authority in the country, to assume the post of minister of 
national defense. I responded to the call of duty out of my 
feelings about the seriousness of the situation and put all of 
my energy into the service of the military establishment, not 
striving for posts and protocol, but out of my belief that the 
homeland is above all other considerations, just as the National 
People's Army supported and backed--and is still supporting and 
backing--all efforts to take the country out of its multi-sided 
crisis by way of serious dialogue. Therefore, I supported my 
brothers' efforts to make the national conference successful in 
order to obtain a national consensus within the framework of the 
document for organizing the transitional phase in accordance 
with the spirit of the constitution. This is so that it will be 
a true expression of the tendencies of various sections of 
society, in order to guarantee a wide popular mobilization, and 
in order to end the scattering of the nation and to recruit all 
the sons of the Algerian people, regardless of their political 
affiliations, for the sake of building a new national order in 
which the people are allowed to express their choices with total 
freedom and on correct bases remote from any pressure or 
falsification, without infringing the homeland's supreme 
interest and the stability of the state and its establishments. 
  Mr. Chairman, members of the Higher State Council, 
gentlemen, 
ladies: My appointment as head of state by the Higher Security 
Council comes after all means have been exhausted [to solve the 
crisis] and in response to the requests from large sections of 
our society who want security, stability, and tranquility. I 
placed myself at the service of the supreme interests of the 
homeland and the nation, with all modesty and sincerity, after I 
saw the deep fragmentation occurring on the political scene, in 
order to unite the sons of Algeria. I have never aspired at any 
time to acquire this lofty task and heavy responsibility. 
  Mr. Chairman, members of the Higher State Council: Thanks to 
your sincere spirit of responsibility and nationalism, you have 
been able to manage the affairs of the country; you have been 
eager to follow the constitution and preserve the state 
institutions. You have created the atmosphere for dialogue and 
consultation that enabled us to entrench the principle of 
rotation in power. By doing this you have provided the proof of 
your sincerity and your zeal in the service of the state and the 
homeland within the framework of the principles of the November 
revolution, and you have fulfilled the pledge you made in the 14 
January 1992 declaration. 
  The coming generations will remember and history will record 
this exemplary stand. In my turn I offer you my thanks for what 
you have done for the people and the homeland. May God render 
us successful and guide our steps. Peace and blessings of God 
be upon you. [applause]

  [Text] Athens, Jan. 30, IRNA -- The Islamic Salvation Front 
(FIS) Sunday dismissed the appointment of the defence minister 
as the new head of the Algerian regime as "insignificant," and 
said days of the military-backed regime were "numbered." 
  Algeria's High State Council Sunday named General Liamine 
Zeroual, defence minister for the past six months, as head the 
new regime after the collapse of last week's national conference. 
  "For us the issue is of no importance. The regime has lost 
its last card after the failure of the national conference. The 
regime is now politically bankrupt," a spokesman for FIS, 
Yousuf, told IRNA by phone from Germany. 
  The official FIS spokesman in Europe Rabeh Kabir, who lives 
in exile in Germany, was not available for immediate comments on 
the naming of General Zeroual. 
  He will replace the High State Council which was set up by 
the military two years ago after the cancellation of elections 
in the wake of a landslide victory for FIS. 
  The appointment of General Zeroul implies that the army 
wants 
to continue its role as the main decision maker in Algeria. 
  In a separate statement, faxed to IRNA sunday, FIS blamed 
the 
regime for the killing of a leader of the Islamic Hamas [Islamic 
Society Movement] in Algeria professor Mohammad Bouslimani. 
  "The world should know that this regime has lost all 
justification for its existence and its days are numbered. 
Hence it took recourse to assassinating professor Mohammad 
Bouslimani as a ring in the shameless chain aimed at making 
Islamists hit each other," said the Arabic statement Nr. 10. 
  It said "FIS strongly condemns and denounces this 
assassination and all of its kind," and added that there is no 
solution to the crisis except by "responding to the demand of 
the people to choose its rulers and to the right to live under 
the shade of an Islamic state." 
  Last Tuesday's national conference held near Algiers was 
seen as a last ditch move by the regime to preserve its illegal 
rule. Major political parties boycotted it and the 2-day meeting 
ended in failure when former foreign minister Abdel-Aziz 
Bouteflika refused the post for the presidency. 
  The Islamists in Algeria are struggling to create an Islamic 
state after they were robbed of certain election victory by the 
army in January 1992. 
  The regime banned FIS and imprisoned thousands of Islamists. 
Nearly 2,000 Islamists, security personnel and other citizens 
have been killed in the violence.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] After its meeting today at the 
presidency of the republic, the Higher Security Council 
appointed Lamine Zeroual as head of state, and he will keep his 
post as national defense minister. Zeroual will be sworn-in 
tomorrow. [passage omitted] 
  Zeroual, the president-designate and national defense 
minister will assume several tasks in his capacity as head of 
state. These tasks have been fixed by Article 13 of the 
document of the national consensus platform [recently reached at 
the national conference in Algiers]. Nasira Mennan reports: 
  [Mennan] The head of state has several authorities and 
prerogatives: He is the commander-in-chief of all the Armed 
Forces of the republic; he is in charge of national defense; he 
decides and guides the foreign policy of the nation; he presides 
over the Council of Ministers, appoints and puts an end to the 
job of the prime minister, makes appointments in the civil and 
military state functions, and signs presidential decrees. He 
has the right to pardon, to reduce, or replace sentences. He 
may consult the people through referendum on any issue of 
national interest. He also appoints the ambassadors 
extraordinary and envoys abroad. [passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] Zeroual, the head of state and minister of 
national defense, has an enormous responsibility, particularly 
leading the country to safe shores. Chaabane Bounakel reports: 
  [Bounakel] The appointment of Zeroual as head of state and 
minister of defense is considered an important political event 
and a turning point in national political life. The man is 
known for his honesty and sincerity, and he has secured the 
respect of the public and the political class with its various 
tendencies. 
  Zeroual is assuming a heavy task, and he should receive the 
understanding, support and backing from all social and political 
partners. This is a national matter that binds all and cannot 
bear a retreat. 
  Just as his withdrawal from the scene was a rejection of 
blessing a weak political system after the eruption of the 
October [1988] events, and the bad management of the economy, 
the abandonment by the state of its social role, the deviation 
of some administrative organs, the domination of a narrow 
partisan view amid the public, the return of the man at this 
precise moment and after the convening of the national consensus 
conference, all the more since he is both head of state and 
defense minister, his return at this moment is in itself 
considered the main guarantee for the national public in the 
first place, second for political and social partners, and third 
for the regional and international public. 
  For Algeria in a national consensus, which has not been easy 
to attain, it has indeed found its way toward the transcending 
of the trial and to move assuredly from the stage of the single 
political party system to a new national system that entrenches 
genuine democracy. The matter is not easy: Just as the 
military establishment has provided categorical proof and 
evidence of its goodwill not to spare any effort to get out of 
the crisis, the political classes, particularly those deeply 
nationalist and determined to meet the challenges, transcend the 
crisis and give momentum to the wheel of the real change the 
people want, these classes should drop any worn out positions 
and practices. 
  This double appointment is not at all a review of the 
withdrawal of the national people's army from the political army 
as much as it is a respect for the will of the people to get out 
of the crisis, and a way of avoiding the Army becoming a tool in 
the framework of the political conflicts of any side. The 
military establishment is a national school that forms tough 
men, and these men will assuredly not retreat from answering the 
call of the homeland.

<F P=106> [Interview with Rabeh Kebir, official spokesman of the </F>
Algerian Islamic Salvation Front, FIS, by Salim Badawi; from 
"The Event" program ; date and place not given--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Badawi] The national dialogue conference was 
held on time but its success was not certain. Its failure was 
expected by major Algerian parties and forces, especially the 
FIS, whose spokesman abroad, Rabeh Kebir, says that since the 
dialogue has failed, a serious, deep-rooted solution must be 
sought. This should begin by releasing all detainees and 
entering serious negotiations with the FIS preparatory to 
handing over power to the real representative of the Algerian 
people. Here is Rabeh Kebir: 
  [Kebir] The failure of the dialogue committee was expected. 
We were not surprised. Everybody knows the FIS won the 
elections, in addition to other two parties, the National 
Liberation Front and the Socialist Forces Party. But since that 
time, the putschists have refused to deal seriously with the 
winning parties. They tried to create a counter-front against 
the FIS. They did not succeed. Then they resorted to lies, 
because before and after the dialogue conference there were 
rumors that the FIS would participate. The aim was clearly to 
confuse the people and pressure the parties. 
  Now that the dialogue has failed, and its failure was 
expected, a deep-rooted, serious solution must be sought. I 
believe those in power now cannot go on because the country's 
resources are wasted everyday. Their own interests are 
threatened in Algeria. They cannot do what they want. I 
believe that the wise ones should seek a serious solution. This 
begins by releasing all detainees and entering serious 
negotiations with the FIS preparatory to handing over power to 
the real representative of the Algerian people. 
  [Badawi] Do you consider the failure of the national 
dialogue 
conference to be a victory for the FIS? 
  [Kebir] Absolutely. Because the FIS is working in a clear 
way and on correct principles, it is moving from one victory to 
another despite the fact that it sometimes seems to fall into 
troubles, that it has been exposed to injustice. But, I believe 
this is only logical in the lives of great movements that demand 
deep-rooted changes. [passage omitted] 
  [Badawi] Concerning the future, you spoke of the need for 
deep-rooted changes. How do you view these changes and are you 
prepared to share power, first on the legislative level, with 
the other political parties and sides in Algeria preparatory to 
crystallizing a future picture of the government? 
  [Kebir] The demands of the FIS have been clear from the 
beginning. It was expressed in its charters and in its election 
campaign. It wants to build an Islamic state based on Islamic 
principles as stipulated in the November statement. This is not 
an invention. This is a demand of the early martyrs. Since 
this is the demand of the martyrs and mujahdin in November, this 
means that those who are present in the political arena... 
[pauses] it is supposed to be the demand of everyone. By God, 
we will work with those who accept this demand, the demand of 
establishing an Algerian state within the framework of Islamic 
principles. 
  [Badawi] Otherwise? 
  [Kebir] By God, our demands are clear. We cannot concede 
this principle. 
  [Badawi] Does this mean that there is no place for the other 
parties that do not call for establishing an Islamic state in 
Algeria? 
  [Kebir] I do not say this. The issue of the establishment of 
parties or our (?nonacceptance) is connected with the Algerian 
people. The election explained this. We certainly welcome the 
parties that were elected by the people. But those who lead the 
country, as is known in all world countries, are the party that 
gets the majority. The other parties may participate in power 
with ministerial portfolios and other things. This is logical 
but always within the planning of the majority party. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Algiers, Jan 31 (AFP)--Unidentified killers murdered 
the national secretary of Algeria's Rally for Culture and 
Democracy (RCD), Rachid Tigziri, early Monday outside his home 
in an eastern suburb of Algiers, family sources said. 
  A cultural association representing Algeria's original 
Berber 
inhabitants, from whom the RCD draws its support, blamed the 
"odious crime" on "terrorists" in a statement. 
  Tigziri was the first national official of a political party 
to be murdered since armed Islamic fundamentalists began waging 
a guerrilla war against the state two years ago. Numerous 
intellectuals have been assassinated as part of a campaign of 
fear. 
  The attackers slit Tigziri's throat as he was heading for 
his 
car outside the building in Bach Djarah, one of the strongholds 
of Islamic fundamentalism in the region around the capital. 
  Formerly a senior civil servant at the Ministry of Labour, 
Tigziri had been economics spokesman for the RCD, led by Said 
Sadi. Tigziri, 42, was married and had no children. 
  "Algeria has again lost one of its finest sons, an activist 
for all the democratic causes," the Berber cultural grouping Si 
Muhand U Mhend said in its statement, adding that the 
association would "remain mobilised" and that "republican 
Algeria will win." 
  Tens of thousands of Berber people have held demonstrations 
in towns in the Kabylie region this month to protest against the 
Muslim extremist violence as well as what they presented as 
repression of their culture by the authorities.

  [Text] It was officially confirmed today that the Cheikh 
preacher Mohamed Bouslimani, chairman of the Reform and Guidance 
association, has been assassinated. This was mentioned in a 
statement signed by the deputy chairman of the Reform and 
Guidance Association, and the radio received a copy of the 
statement. 
  The statement points out that a at around 1330 today, a 
delegation from the family of the assassinated Cheikh identified 
the body while accompanied by members of the bureau of the 
association at the military hospital of Ain Naadja. 
  It is worth recalling that Cheikh Bouslimani, may God have 
mercy on him, was kidnapped from his home in Blida by four armed 
men two months ago.

arrested two Islamic militants in connection with the kidnap and 
murder of Mohammed Bouslimani, the president of the charity 
Al-Islah wa al-Irshad. 
  Bouslimani's body was found a week ago in El Affroun near 
Blida two months after his abduction at the end of November. 
  A police statement said agronomist Guitoun Nasser and imam 
Rashid Zerani, 26, an inspector in Algeria's fraud squad, had 
kidnapped the charity leader on the orders of Djaafar al-Afghani 
leader of the Islamic Armed Group (GIA). 
  It said Al-Afghani had ordered the killing after a series of 
discussions with Bouslimani.

  [Text] Some Western newspapers, primary among which is the 
French LE MONDE, have disseminated a report that Algeria has 
suspended payment on external debt servicing. This report was 
denied yesterday by sources close to the government. The 
sources said that Algeria has been continuing to service its 
foreign debt. Nasira Bouzid reports: 
  [Bouzid] Algeria continues payment of its external debts by 
the required time. Sources close to the prime minister's office 
have told APS that Algeria has paid in succession $900 million 
and $600 million as debt principal and services, for the 
payments due in December last and this month, January, alone. 
Likewise, in December 1992 and January 1993, Algeria paid in 
succession $911 million and $694 million. 
  The same sources said that the reorganization of debt 
management procedures in order to improve them had led to a 
purely administrative delay. The prime minister's office 
stressed that Algeria continues to make all efforts to preserve 
its policy of respect for foreign commitments. The same sources 
thereby denied the reports carried by some Western newspapers, 
especially LE MONDE, which had a headline on its front page 
yesterday saying: Algeria Suspends Payment of its External Debt. 
The government sources described these reports as groundless.

  [Text] Cairo, 31 Jan (MENA)--The newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH 
says Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's statements are 
designed to avoid meeting the April deadline to implement the 
Gaza-Jericho Agreement just as he avoided beginning the 
withdrawal on 13 December. 
  The paper adds: Israel knows how to sell the illusions of 
peace to obtain more arms deals and restore its ties with many 
countries. The U.S. pressure to end the Arab boycott of Israel 
before the latter takes any concrete step proves this. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH points out that Israel has a long experience 
in 
prevarication and maneuvers, the most recent of which was the 
farce over a referendum on withdrawal from the Golan Heights. 
This was a move intended to confront the results of the Geneva 
summit between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President 
Bill Clinton. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH concludes: Washington apparently approves of 
this game as demonstrated by a remark made by U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher that his country, although a full 
partner to the process, will not pressure Syria or Israel in the 
peace negotiations and will not mediate unless requested to by 
both parties.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Statement That Raises Hope"] </F>
  [Text] Certainly we must not ignore the statement that U.S. 
President Bill Clinton made to the American television network 
CNN yesterday, which was reported by all international news 
agencies. The importance of this statement is due to two 
factors: First, it comes a few days after the Geneva summit with 
Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and, second, it comes a few days 
before the resumption of the bilateral negotiations in 
Washing?on after a suspension of about four months. 
  What did President Clinton say? He declared that he will do 
all he can to establish an honorable, permanent, and acceptable 
peace in the Middle East. He said that peace is the outstanding 
priority of U.S. policy in the region. Evaluating the Geneva 
summit, President Clinton said that Syrian President Hafiz 
al-Asad was sincere when he emphasized to him Syria's concern to 
reach peace, which he described as very important to Syria and 
to all Arab peoples. Clinton said that he wants to see a peace 
agreement between the Arab countries and Israel. He noted that 
his meeting with President al-Asad in Geneva was serious and 
great. 
  Regarding Lebanon, President Clinton said that the talks 
with 
President al-Asad in Geneva dealt with implementing the al-Ta'if 
agreement and that they agreed that Lebanon should return to 
being an independent and sovereign state and that all foreign 
forces should withdraw. 
  These positive statements prompt us to rise to our feet in 
respect for U.S. President Bill Clinton and to call on him at 
the same time to translate them into action on all the 
Palestinian, Syrian, Lebanese, and Jordanian negotiating tracks. 
Fortunately, the Washington bilateral negotiations will be 
resumed on Monday on all tracks. We have a right to be 
optimistic and to expect great results from these negotiations. 
  The United States provides Israel with everything from bread 
to missiles. As we know, there are strategic cooperation 
agreements between them that allow Israel, as happened recently, 
to transfer advanced U.S. technology. Since the Arab party's 
intentions have been proven serious to the United States as 
President Clinton himself noted, it remains for him to signal to 
Israel that withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and 
recognition of the Palestinian people's rights have become a 
requisite that must be fulfilled sooner rather than later. 
  Israel is maneuvering on all negotiating tracks and instead 
of proceeding seriously and directly toward peace, we find that 
it is trying to incite Arabs against each other. First Israel 
focuses on the Syrian track so that one thinks that a solution 
is imminent. Israel then abruptly leaves Syria and focuses on 
the Palestinians so that everyone thinks that a solution is at 
hand. It then leaves the Palestinians and returns to the 
Syrians. It continues this approach in an attempt to generate 
concern and division among the Arabs, pretending that this is 
the nature of negotiations. 
  We Arabs have all become convinced of America's role as a 
full partner in the peace process. We are all convinced that 
the role of a full partner cannot only be played through 
statements. This role must be exercised practically by advising 
Israel that its security cannot be achieved by capturing the 
land of others but by striking a balance in the interests of all 
parties and living together within a framework of good 
neighborliness and cooperation in all areas. President Clinton's 
statement raises our hopes and affirms that peace is making 
progress despite Israel's maneuvers. It remains to translate 
these statements into action.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "An American Priority"] </F>
  [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton has declared that 
establishing peace in the Middle East is one of the highest 
priorities of U.S. policy. He promised to exert everything in 
his power to establish an honorable and permanent peace that is 
acceptable to all parties. 
  President Clinton said in the interview he gave to CNN that 
his meeting in Geneva with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad was 
great and serious. He added that he is convinced that the 
Syrian president is honest when confirming Syria's interest in 
establishing peace and is committed to finding an agreement for 
a settlement with Israel on the basis of peace prevailing on 
both the Lebanese and Jordanian fronts, in addition to the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement. 
  The statements by the U.S. President came after he met twice 
with Jordanian monarch King Husayn and before a series of 
meetings that were held in Oslo between U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher, Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat, and 
Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. 
  The preparatory meetings start in Washington today between 
the Arab delegations taking part in the bilateral peace talks 
with Israel in preparation for resuming these negotiations at 
the beginning of the next month, after they have been stopped 
and stalled for a long time. 
  Since the United States gives priority to peace efforts in 
the Middle East, we hope that the U.S. capital will soon witness 
concurrent agreements between Israel and Syria, Lebanon, and 
Jordan respectively along the lines of the Palestinian-Israeli 
agreement, which will bring about a historic reconciliation and 
an honorable and permanent peace through which cooperation and 
good neighborliness can replace bloodshed and fighting.

  [Text] Political sources have told AL-SHA'B that during his 
tour of the region U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown has 
discussed a plan for cooperation among Egypt, Israel, Saudi 
Arabia, and Jordan. Brown met with President Husni Mubarak 
Thursday to discuss the details of the U.S. economic plan, which 
includes the following points: 
  1. Establishing free trade between Israel and the three Arab 
countries through trade agreements between governments. The 
agreements will involve Israeli commodities and products tha? 
can be exported to the three Arab markets, and commodities and 
products of the three Arab countries that can be exported to 
Israel. 
  2. Establishing banking cooperation between the three Arab 
countries and Israel to finance a number of common commercial, 
agricultural, and industrial projects. 
  3. Abolishing restrictions imposed on the private sectors in 
the three Arab countries concerning trade and establishment of 
joint ventures, whether in Israel or in the Arab countries. 
  4. Setting up a four-way committee, with the possibility of 
Palestinians joining it, to study duties on commodities 
exchanged among the four countries. 
  The U.S. plan stresses the need to begin steps for economic 
cooperation in March or April. It says the agreements will 
support the bases of the ongoing peace process. Brown said 
during his talks with President Mubarak that U.S. President Bill 
Clinton is interested in seeing the plan implemented.

<F P=106> [Article by Mustafa Mashhur, deputy leader of the Muslim </F>
Brotherhood: "The Bats Wouldn't Survive in this Light"] 
  [Text] The world today is witnessing a growing Islamic 
awakening fashioned by God and carried out by Islamic movements 
all over the world. This Islamic awakening is growing and 
surging, thanks to our Lord and His care, despite the attempts 
of the enemies of Islam, here and abroad, to harm and wipe it 
out. 
  Even after their war against Russia and the collapse of 
communism, the enemies in the West consider Islam and the 
Muslims the enemies that must be fought with all efforts. They 
have kept NATO and are currently trying to bolster it and 
increase its members. 
  Several regimes in our Arab and Islamic countries responded 
to this tendency by world enemies. Those regimes persecuted and 
subdued the Islamic trend and tortured and intimidated its 
members in a bid to terrorize this trend and prevent the public 
from cooperating with it. 
  But the Islamic nations, which adhere to their religion, 
have 
discovered that the sincere Islamic trend is rallying those who 
are most devoted to their homelands. It has been proven that 
the Islamic nations are making sacrifices, shouldering burdens, 
and enduring afflictions without entertaining any covetous 
designs. But they are doing so for the sake of God and their 
countries. At the same time, the Islamic nations are seeing how 
some of those in power are benefit-seekers and how they are 
plundering public funds and receiving bribes from big-time 
thieves. 
  We read about these grotesque crimes in the press every day. 
But all these crimes are forgotten with the passage of time and 
the criminals never stood trial or were punished, to avoid 
scandal. Those who reveal the crimes are tried and condemned, 
while the real criminal is acquitted. 
  At a time when the widely popular Islamic trend is harassed 
and prevented from performing its public function on the grounds 
that its activities are illegal, we see that some parties that 
are not popular among the people are allowed to perform 
activities through papers and magazines. Those parties even 
receive funds and are presented as the representatives of the 
people. 
  All this is taking place on the basis of a wrong premise. 
Some ruling regimes resort to this premise to create a balance 
between the existing powers. Those regimes try to harass the 
strong Islamic trend to allow antifreedom forces to perform 
activities in a bid to minimize the people's cooperation with 
this strong Islamic trend. But no matter how the defeated 
secular forces and remnants of communism try, they would not be 
able to influence this religious Muslim people. 
  Perhaps it is useful for the younger generations to know 
some 
historical facts about the past: In 1964, Russian Prime Minister 
Khrushchev came to Egypt to inaugurate the second phase of the 
High Dam. He insisted that all communist prisoners be released 
before he arrived in Egypt. He also said that the communists 
should be allowed to work in the entire Egyptian media service. 
This is what indeed happened. The communists, who were with us 
in the same al- Wahat prison, took control of the media and 
exploited the whole service to spread their ideas and cast 
doubts in Islam. 
  When al-Sadat assumed power and jumped from the Russian bed 
to the U.S. bed, he tried to lessen the leftist presence in the 
media. But the leftist remnants continued their activities. The 
rulers, however, thought that it would be in their interest to 
keep the leftists to confront the growing Islamic trend. 
  We now see that the present regime is giving those writers 
whose hearts are imbued with hatred and rancor against Islam and 
the Islamic movements free access to the national papers to 
inject their poison against Islam and describe it with violence 
and terrorism, using some acts of violence and the killings and 
counter-killings between some youth and security and police 
force as their pretext. These acts did not exist before, but 
came as a result of the policy of suppression and intimidation, 
economic crises, unemployment, increase in prices. These acts, 
in addition to the government's policy of meeting violence with 
violence, add fuel to the fire. The government's tolerance of 
sinful practices such as drinking alcohol, gambling, usury, 
prostitution, immoral media, and drugs seems to be an 
intentional policy to create a balance between religiousness and 
moral decadence. 
  We have been reading for some time now about planned 
campaigns against some parties that are trying to protect 
society from those who seek to spread corruption, cause 
disintegration, and cast doubt on the faith. We notice that the 
campaign harms the holy al-Azhar and its ulema, who over the 
ages stood up against malicious campaigns against Islam, the 
Egyptian nation's official religion according to the 
Constitution. 
  Have the remnants of communism forgotten that Russia 
considered religion the opiate of the people and that it 
punished anyone in possession of a Koran or anyone who advocated 
any religion other than communism? Where was the freedom of 
opinion? Why didn't they object to this kind of suppression? 
  Islam, the righteous religion that God has chosen for his 
people, is a religion of peace, freedom, justice, security, and 
safety. Islam does not approve of any injustice by any party 
against another and is unique in the sense that it promotes 
virtue and suppresses vice. It is the duty of the nation's 
ulema to balance things according to Islam's accurate scales and 
to caution about what is good and what is bad. If a controversy 
arises over an issue, it should be referred to God's book and to 
the tradition of his Prophet, may God's prayer and salutation be 
upon him. There is no human being who knows more about what is 
good and what is bad for us than God and his messenger. 
  These malicious campaigns are launched by those who are 
called the vanguard in enlightening public opinion about Islam's 
darkness and shackles and who claim that religion has no 
authority over art and literature. We should stand up to these 
campaigns and refute them with unequivocal arguments. In the 
first place, reality requires these bats to hide in their holes 
and in the places of darkness and suppression where communism 
lived, now that they cannot survive in the age of light in which 
nations demand freedom and true representation. The people 
should listen to each party's propaganda and then decide what is 
right and what is wrong and what is beneficial and what is 
corrupt. 
  We accept what society decides in genuine, fair elections. 
But to devise laws marginalizing the Islamic trend and barring 
this trend from actual participation in legislative elections or 
to intervene by committing forgery and so forth contradicts the 
creed of the much-abused democracy. 
  Had the ruling regime not encouraged this approach, no 
magazine would have dared to publish this stuff, defying the 
authority of law and the Constitution and even practically 
annulling them and denigrating al-Azhar's role in protecting 
society against any attempt to harm it. A society's value 
depends on its adherence to virtuous principles and keeping away 
from depraved morals. God, our creator, has laid down these 
limits for us and explained what is good and what is bad; but to 
confuse these limits is corruption itself, and we do not trust 
the intentions of those who advocate such behavior. 
  We know that the enemies of Islam promote such ideas and 
find 
people among us who will cooperate with them in the name of 
freedom. 
  This magazine's challenge, by publishing material 
unanimously 
deemed corrupt and mean by the judicial authorities, should not 
be tolerated in silence by the holy al-Azhar and the Government 
if they truly mean good for this country. The magazine's 
publication of excerpts from the book "The Satanic Verses" 
despite the proven fact that the book attacks Islam and Islam's 
prophet, is a flagrant declaration of war against Islam, the 
faith of this Muslim nation. 
  Demonstrations and sacrifices were made in some countries 
where parts of this book were published. Does the Government 
realize the danger it poses when at a time when we need help to 
stop acts of violence, the magazine is fueling the fire? 
  The government should have taken the necessary measures to 
help create calm and stability by lifting restrictions on 
liberties and releasing those who have not been incriminated. 
The government should also stop the sinful practices such as 
drinking alcohol, prostitution, and usury. It should rectify 
the government media, which are full of corruption. The 
government should be firm with both large-scale and small-time 
thieves and should bring up generations on educational and 
ethical methods. 
  The Cairo international book fair is approaching. We hope it 
will be utilized to reform those with corrupt ideas, and not to 
draw up a plan to harm values and ethics or give an opportunity 
to those hiding behind the facade of the so-called enlightenment. 
  Let's review the scenes of struggle between the Muslims and 
others so that we can see who is responsible for the acts of 
violence and terrorism. Are they Muslims or others? Who are 
the terrorists in Palestine? Is it the Zionists or the 
stone-throwers who are defending their land, which the enemy has 
usurped by means of force, killings, deportations, and 
displacement? Who are the terrorists in Bosnia-Herzegovina? Is 
it the Muslims, who are defending their land and who are 
deprived of weapons, or the Serbs and Croatians, who have killed 
hundreds of thousands, raped tens of thousands of women, and 
evicted hundreds of thousands? 
  Who are the terrorists in Kashmir? Are they the Muslims, who 
have been defending their usurped freedom over the past 40 
years, or the Hindu soldiers, who are committing atrocities 
similar to those being committed in Bosnia-Herzegovina? In 
Cambodia, the Buddhists are killing hundreds of thousands of 
Muslims and no one is doing anything to protect the oppressed 
there. These tragedies are a lasting disgrace for the whole 
world, which remains silent about these acts. It is also a 
lasting disgrace in the history of the Arab and Islamic world, 
which has not taken the appropriate stand dictated by the creed 
of their peoples--a creed that calls for unity. 
  If we look at the international situation, we will find that 
the oppressed Muslims are standing fast, enduring, and remaining 
firm; they have not relinquished their creed or their land. 
Those Muslims are hopeful that God will support them and will 
grant them victory ?one day. 
  Here in Egypt we see that despite the harassment of the 
Islamic trend, the Islamists won victories in the elections in 
the professional associations and various university faculty 
clubs. The Islamists scored victories despite the government's 
unified trade union law, which is difficult to surmount. But 
the Islamists were prepared for the elections and managed to 
surmount the obstacles. Perhaps the government is thinking of 
another solution or of placing more difficult obstacles. But we 
tell all these people [not further specified] not to swim 
against the current. We are full of hope that God will not 
abandon his faithful people and will support righteousness and 
will destroy falsehood and its advocates. And God hath full 
power and control over His affairs; but most among mankind know 
it not [Koranic verse]. 
  Out of sympathy, I advise them to reconsider their position 
because they will not be able to impede this Islamic awakening. 
Nor will they be able to dissuade the Egyptian people from 
demanding the adoption of God's law. God will uphold 
righteousness and will destroy falsehood. This is God's way and 
it will not be thwarted. It is better for them and for the 
country to save their efforts and not to stir up tension, 
because we need calm and cooperation. I only desire your 
betterment to the best of my power; and my success in my task 
can only come from God. [Koranic verse]

  [Text] Surt (Libya), AL-HAYAH -- Libyan Prime Minister 
Abu-Zayd 'Umar Durdah has stressed that the disappearance of 
former Libyan Foreign Minister Mansur al-Kikhya in Cairo on 10 
December "is a conspiracy aimed against Egyptian-Libyan 
relations" in order to drive a wedge that "would lead to the 
closure of the border between the two countries with a view to 
suffocating Libya and intensifying the embargo on it." 
  In a statement to AL-HAYAH Durdah saluted "the Egyptian 
brothers for their awareness of the conspiracy." He pointed out 
that the economic effects of the Lockerbie crisis has paralyzed 
Libya's ability to meet spending requirements in all spheres, 
especially with regard to new development projects and securing 
foreign currency to finance imports. 
  He pointed out that exporting states are setting the 
condition that Libya pay the financial credits for imports in 
full. He said that even the budgets of the biggest and richest 
states cannot do that. 
  On Libya's cooperation with Egypt and Tunis, he said that 
"European states took accounts of their interests when they 
adopted the resolutions against Libya. But some Arab brothers 
-- either because they did not directly read the text of the 
Security Council resolution or because of the influence of 
Western media services -- did not understand the resolution the 
way the Western states concerned with the crisis did." He 
declined to name these states. 
  On the reduction in the volume of Egyptian-Libyan trade 
after 
Mansur al-Kikhya's disappearance, he said: "There is no link 
between trade and al-Kikhya's disappearance. Libya has lost 
billions of dollars as a result of the freezing of its assets 
abroad. And Libya has taken a number of measures" -- he 
declined to reveal them -- "to secure the largest amount 
possible of these investments, especially liquid investment or 
those that are easy to liquefy." 
  On the measures Libya is going to take to reduce workers, 
Durdah said: "Necessity knows no laws." Libya is preparing 
steps in this connection, but it will not touch Egyptian and 
Tunisian workers in particular.

newspaper has printed a detailed report on the visit by Qatar's 
foreign minister, Shaykh Hamad bin-Jabbur al-Thani, to America, 
and his meetings with American officials, including Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher. 
  The report states: Despite America's caution to Qatar about 
its ties with Iran, and the request to Qatar to sever these 
ties, the Qatari foreign minister, in his meeting with 
reporters, described the stances of his country vis-a-vis 
strengthening relations with the Islamic republic of Iran and 
other regional countries. 
  According to this newspaper, the American secretary of state 
called Iran a dangerous country and cautioned Qatar against 
moving close to Iran. In response to Christopher's request, the

circumstances, change its policy toward Iran, and will make 
efforts to establish the best possible relations with the 
Islamic republic of Iran.

meeting while our people are looking forward, with strong hopes 
and great confidence, to ending the regrettable crisis which 
surfaced on 19 August 1993, and which we never sought in the

has been a terrible nightmare that weighed heavily on the minds 
of the people, who have been caused a great deal of suffering, 
the brother Presidential Council chairman maintained.

  [Text] The Standing Committee of the General People's 
Congress [GPC] today held an extraordinary session under brother 
Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the 
Presidential Council and GPC secretary general. During this 
session, the Standing Committee examined several issues and 
developments on the national scene, particularly the recent 
developments in our country in light of the finalization of the 
document of pledge and accord by the Political Forces Dialogue 
Committee to overcome the crisis and build the Yemeni state as 
well as the positive supportive stand declared toward this 
document by the GPC. 
  The conferees also discussed a number of organizational 
issues as well as the missions and tasks the GPC will undertake 
during the forthcoming phase. 
  The session was opened by Koranic recitations. Brother Lt. 
Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council 
and GPC secretary general, then delivered a speech, noting the 
importance of this extraordinary session of the GPC Standing 
Committee, and highlighting the critical issues it is examining, 
chief among which is the accord document initialed by the 
parties to the Political Forces Dialogue Committee. He said 
that our people are currently on the threshold of an important 
historical phase after the realization of their great 
accomplishment on 22 May 1990. He added: Right now, we are 
meeting while our people are looking forward, with strong hopes 
and great confidence, to ending the regrettable crisis which 
surfaced on 19 August 1993, and which we never sought in the 
first place. This crisis has caused immense devastation. It 
has been a terrible nightmare that weighed heavily on the minds 
of the people, who have been caused a great deal of suffering, 
the brother Presidential Council chairman maintained. 
  The chairman of the Presidential Council and the GPC 
secretary general added: When unity was achieved, we agreed to 
follow the best way in our experiment to build a new Yemen. We 
also agreed to follow positive courses in this experiment. He 
added: The crises are not part of these positive courses. 
  There were many good mechanisms that could have been 
followed 
in the fields of development, administration, and building the 
individual. Also, there are many positive courses that could be 
followed in building streets, establishing the basic structures 
of development, founding educational academies, and exploiting 
resources. 
  Salih said: What calls for pride is that the GPC has always 
championed these mechanisms and has played a prominent role in 
achieving many of the achievements witnessed by all Yemenis. 
The mechanism of the GPC was that of building and construction, 
promoting the standards of individuals, safeguarding the 
people's blood and rights, and respecting their rights, Salih 
maintained. The GPC has always shown love and tolerance to all 
out of its concern for the higher interests of the homeland and 
people. It also cooperated with the honest and good national 
forces to build Yemen's prosperous future. 
  Salih added that the GPC has a clear record full of good 
intentions and sacrifices for the homeland, and full of 
tolerance and amity among its members and with others. The GPC 
has embodied the strong commitment to democracy within its ranks 
and in dealing with others, and has pioneered the entrenching of 
political pluralism within the party's framework. The party has 
provided a national umbrella for all to work for a secure, 
unified, and prosperous homeland. 
  The brother president said: The crisis and all its 
repercussions--the likes of which the homeland had never 
witnessed throughout its contemporary history--constituted a 
clear circumvention of constitutional legitimacy and the results 
of the parliamentary elections held on 27 April 1993, which 
represented the shining image of the great unity achievement. 
However, we hope that the document of pledge and accord will be 
the means for resolving the crisis and deterring those who want 
to harm the homeland, its unity, and democratic march. We have 
to begin a new stage in which everyone shoulders his 
responsibilities concerning the practical implementation of the 
document, and everyone devotes himself to construction and 
development rather than continuing these repeated crises, the 
reasons for which we all know, as well as those responsible for 
them. 
  President Salih said: Sanaa, the political capital of united 
Yemen, which embraced all the Yemeni homeland's sons throughout 
the stages of national struggle for liberation from British 
tyranny and colonialism, will continue to be the city of peace 
and steadfastness, and will continue to embrace unity. Sanaa 
will also embrace all parties, the same as it embraced the 
revolution and the republican system and protected them in the 
face of all challenges and all hostile attacks launched by the 
revolution's enemies in the 1960's and 1970's. 
  He said: On 22 May 1990 we began a new stage, and we should 
eliminate the consequences of the past mentality and the 
remnants of the totalitarian regime. We should never allow the 
mentality of conspiracy, bloody coups, and ideological and 
political terrorism to return or dominate our new life. Today, 
we call on GPC cadres and supporters to prepare to be--as our 
people have known them to be--at the forefront of the national 
fold, shouldering their responsibilities efficiently and 
sincerely to safeguard unity and democracy, and to grasp and 
interact with the facts and all national and international 
changes in a manner that meets our people's aspirations for 
progress and prosperity. They should always be the strong 
defenders of unity and democracy. 
  He said: We highly appreciate the efforts made by the 
Political Forces Dialogue Committee, and applaud the role played 
by the GPC representative within the framework of the committee. 
We hope that the political forces, led by the GPC, the Yemeni 
Socialist Party, and the Yemeni Reform Grouping, will intensify 
their efforts to implement the document. This is the real test 
of credibility and intentions, and this requires unity of 
political will and collective efforts by all constitutional 
establishments to shoulder their duties in an effective manner 
in order to implement the document. 
  The brother president said: We call on all political forces, 
social figures, intellectuals, and all the homeland's sons to 
comprehend well the dangers facing the homeland, and to be 
united in the face of all those who try to divide the national 
fold or endanger our national and homeland's unity. We should 
move to the stage of construction rather than harmful political 
disputes. He who calls for sectarianism is not one of us 
because we are a united Yemeni people and all of us shoulder the 
responsibility for maintaining the unity of the ranks and 
homeland. 
  The Standing Committee discussed several important national 
and organizational issues on its agenda, as well as developments 
relating to the political crisis. The committee will continue 
its discussions tomorrow, Monday.

  [Text] Baghdad, 31 Jan (INA) -- AL-THAWRAH newspaper says 
the decisionmaking process in the United States reveals the 
extent of the Zionist lobby's control of U.S. policy. 
  In an article today, the paper, speaking for the Arab 
Socialist Ba'th Party, notes the U.S. Senate decision 
prohibiting U.S. arms sales to any Arab state that adheres to 
the boycott of "Israel." The Senate's unanimous decision shows 
very clearly to what degree U.S. decisionmakers are under the 
control of the Zionist octopus at the expense of legitimate U.S. 
interests and U.S. taxpayers. 
  The paper also highlights the U.S. Administration's attitude 
toward the Zionist lobby's domination, saying that the tentacles 
of the Zionist octopus are all over the White House and that the 
Presidential Office is not safe from Zionist influence. In this 
regard, the paper notes what happened when another nominee was 
appointed to replace the former Defense Secretary Les Aspin, who 
reportedly resigned for personal reasons. The Zionist lobby 
forced President Clinton to withdraw his nomination of the 
retired General Bobby Inman in favor of the Zionist candidate 
William Perry, Aspin's deputy who is known for his intelligence 
activities. 
  The ban on arms sales and the withdrawal of Inman's 
nomination show that U.S. decisions are purely Zionist in terms 
of their substance, endorsement, and aims. No one can now dare 
to differentiate between U.S. national interests and those of 
world Zionism and its usurping entity in occupied Palestine. 
  The paper says the Zionist octopus is ruling the United 
States through U.S. tools. It is enough here to note that four 
senior officials of the U.S. Administration, led by Vice 
President Al Gore, are well-known Zionists. 
  The paper also reviews the effects of this situation on 
developments in the Arab arena. The Arab rulers who have tied 
their decisions to U.S. decisions are, in reality, carrying out 
the orders and decisions of Zionism. They should expect more 
humiliating and disgraceful decisions. 
  The paper highlights the attempts of some Arab regimes to 
break and end the Arab boycott of the Zionist entity, saying 
that, in light of this, the U.S. Administration is in no need of 
such a Zionist decision to ban arms sales to countries that 
boycott "Israel". 
  The paper cites Republican Senator Brown as saying that most 
Arab countries do not oppose such a measure, and that some of 
them have indeed dropped the boycott. In fact, there are some 
people in the region who are more eager than Brown to end the 
Arab boycott of the Zionist entity and tighten the Iraq embargo.

  [Text] We have received confirmed news from Baghdad saying 
that on the evening of Wednesday, 26 January 1994, a number of 
jumbo [preceding word in English] cars, affiliated with the 
Iraqi regime's intelligence service, were driven at high speed 
into a square near the Baghdad International Fair, which has 
become a market for dollar dealers. The Iraqi regime's 
intelligence forces asked the dealers to be quiet and to remain 
in their places. However, the dealers, who were aware of the 
intentions of the intelligence men, tried to escape. The 
regime's men fired at those who tried to escape, killing and 
wounding many innocent people. After gaining control over the 
area, the regime men arrested many people and left the bodies of 
the slain in the streets. Such criminal acts have exacerbated 
the miserable situation in Baghdad and increased the citizens' 
worries.

mediating to buy and sell foreign currencies in Baghdad in 
accordance with the instructions issued by the Central Bank of 
Iraq in this regard. 
  A responsible source at the control directorate overseeing 
banks' foreign transfers told the Iraqi News Agency that the 
activities of these companies are confined to mediating to sell 
foreign currencies at a commission defined by the bank. He 
pointed out that these companies are not allowed to present 
direct or indirect credit offers and facilities, open current 
accounts for their currencies, accept deposits in any form, or 
present guarantees in local or foreign currencies, except 
sureties presented to the Central Bank of Iraq.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mas'ud Barzani, chairman of the Kurdish </F>
Democratic Party, by Georg Hoffmann-Ostenhof in Arbil, northern 
Iraq; date not given: "Just Like Before an Execution"] 
  [Text] [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] Mr. Barzani, there is an 
elected regional government in northern Iraq and de facto 
autonomy for the Iraqi Kurds. However, the economic situation 
is terrible. Is your experiment doomed to fail? 
  [Barzani] We cannot enjoy our freedom without a functioning 
economy. I am afraid that the Kurds will soon flee again to 
other countries in masses. 
  [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] Do you want to threaten the friendly 
allies, who protect you, with this? 
  [Barzani] No. But if the misery here increases, the people 
will again move to Iran or to Turkey -- or perhaps even to the 
south. 
  [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] To Saddam Husayn's Iraq? 
  [Barzani] If the people are starving.... 
  [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] The UN economic embargo against Iraq 
also hits you, because, despite its autonomy, Kurdistan 
continues to be Iraqi territory. 
  [Barzani] Yes. I have asked the United States several times 
to lift the embargo against us. The answer always was: We know 
that you are not involved in Saddam's criminal acts, we will 
continue to talk about that. But nothing has happened. There 
is a lot of Iraqi money abroad. We have demanded that some of 
this frozen money is given to us -- in vain. 
  [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] Are you in favor of lifting the embargo 
against Iraq in general? 
  [Barzani] It is of no advantage to us that the Iraqi people 
suffer. If the embargo were lifted under UN control, and if the 
sale of Iraqi oil benefited the people in the country and not 
the regime, we would be in favor of it. 
  [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] Iraqi Kurdistan is protected against 
Saddam Husayn's attacks by the Allies. Every six months, the 
question of the protection zone is decided anew. Does this not 
create uncertainty? 
  [Barzani] Our situation is like that of a person sentenced 
to death waiting for execution in his cell. The period of 
protection is again and again extended, of course. However, the 
uncertain wait has fatal psychological effects on the population. 
  [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] Until 1992 you negotiated with Saddam 
Husayn. Then the talks were suspended. Can you envisage a 
resumption? 
  [Barzani] Actually, we only want to negotiate with a 
democratic government. But if the Kurdish people are threatened 
with destruction..., then negotiations with Baghdad will perhaps 
be necessary. 
  [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] Do you really believe that Saddam Husayn 
will be overthrown? 
  [Barzani] This is not so simple. Thirty states were unable 
to overthrow Saddam. But I believe that he is suffering from 
the international isolation. 
  [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] A colorful Iraqi opposition front, which 
is mainly active in exile, presents itself as an alternative to 
dictatorship. Your party is part of it. Is this opposition 
mature enough to take over the government if Saddam is toppled? 
  [Barzani] No matter how I assess the opposition's political 
maturity -- we do not have anything else.

  [Text] Mahabad (West Azarbaijan Prov.), Jan. 29, IRNA -- 
Four peshmergas of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) were 
killed in an offensive by the Islamic Movement forces, an 
informed Iraqi Kurdish source told IRNA here today. 
  According to the source the attack was launched on 'Shuresh' 
camp in Khurmal on Thursday, where the PUK organizational 
committee lies. 
  At least ten partisan operations have been carried out 
against the PUK, headed by Jalal Talabani, over the past ten 
days, during which several of its members have been killed. 
  The new waves of operations are in retaliation for the 
January occupation of Islamic Movements' headquarters and bases 
north of Iraq by the PUK forces.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by Christophe </F>
Boltanski, Marc Kravetz, and Patrick Sabatier in Strasbourg; 
date not given: "Golan, Gaza-Jericho, Referendum...the Israeli 
Prime Minister Analyzes the Situation" -- first paragraph is 
LIBERATION introduction] 
  [Text] Strasbourg -- Yitzhaq Rabin wants "greater 
involvement" by the Europeans in the peace process. The Israeli 
prime minister is particularly counting on their aid to secure 
the lifting of the Arab boycott. Addressing the Parliamentary 
Assembly of the Council of Europe, he gave a positive account of 
the Israeli-Arab negotiations and in particular welcomed the 
"progress" achieved with the Syrians. He tempered this optimism 
in an interview to LIBERATION. 
  [LIBERATION] You have said several times that 1994 will be 
decisive for the Near East. Decisive for a lasting and 
comprehensive peace? 
  [Rabin] I hope so. I am not saying that we will be able to 
achieve peace with all the partners in the negotiations -- 
Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and the Palestinians -- before the end 
of the year. But if we succeed in implementing the agreement 
which we have reached with the PLO, even if we only implement 
its first phase, I think that we will have reached the point of 
no return. The same remark is valid for the negotiations with 
Syria. But, on this point, unless a basic agreement is reached 
on the essential problems in 1994, we have reason to fear that 
it will then be too late. 
  [LIBERATION] Are you optimistic? 
  [Rabin] It is not a question of being optimistic or 
pessimistic. If we really make progress with the Palestinians 
and Syria, then the other questions -- Lebanon and Jordan -- 
will be resolved without any major problem. We have no 
territorial problem with those countries, and there is no 
fundamental obstacle to reaching peace with them. But those two 
countries cannot open the way. 
  [LIBERATION] Many obstacles have arisen in your negotiations 
with the PLO which have delayed the implementation of the 
agreement signed in Washington. Will they be overcome in the 
near future? 
  [Rabin] The real problem stems from a difference in approach 
between Yasir 'Arafat and us. I told him during our long 
conversation in Cairo on 12 December that it was perhaps a 
mistake not to have taken the time to discuss the significance 
of the document which we signed. It all stems from that. He 
thinks, and his viewpoint is understandable, that the first 
phase of the interim Gaza-Jericho agreement is already a step 
toward an independent Palestinian state. The declaration in 
principle clearly specifies that the discussion on the final 
status (of the occupied territories) will start at the latest in 
the two years following the completion of the implementation of 
the Gaza-Jericho agreement. These are not symbolic issues. I am 
not talking about flags, I am talking about a Palestinian 
currency, control of international borders, or other aspects 
which form a practical part of the notion of an independent 
state. They tell us that these are matters of dignity. We 
respect their dignity. But we do not confuse dignity and 
sovereignty and, at this stage, we cannot agree to introduce 
elements which affect sovereignty. 
  [LIBERATION] Which elements, for instance? 
  [Rabin] There are three fundamental problems which may seem 
minor but which, for us, are not minor. Yasir 'Arafat is 
demanding the presence of Palestinian police on the bridge 
(Allenby bridge, the crossing point between Jordan and the West 
Bank). We agree, but we want to be able to interrogate, out of 
their presence, any person, foreigner or Palestinian, who 
crosses the bridge and who, we think, could present a threat to 
our security. The two sides already have a right of veto. But 
that is not enough to prevent anybody from crossing the border. 
We want to be able to check whether our suspicions are founded 
or not. Second, the question of the area of the autonomous 
region of Jericho has not been resolved. 
  Third, they (the Palestinians) want to control a road 
between 
Jericho and the (Allenby) bridge. We agree that any Palestinian 
who has crossed the border should be able to go to Jericho 
without having his identity checked by an Israeli. But they 
want a new road built, and we do not understand what the purpose 
of that is. The safety of travel will remain our responsibility 
outside the areas which will be under the Palestinians' 
authority. 
  [LIBERATION] Would it be possible to envisage a Palestinian 
border post without the visible presence of Israeli soldiers? 
  [Rabin] The declaration in principle clearly states that 
Israel is responsible for external security. It makes reference 
to the crossing points and talks clearly of coordination. We 
accept the presence of Palestinians to deal with the 
Palestinians. But we want to be sure that no terrorist crosses 
the border and that a quarter of a million more Palestinians do 
not come and settle on the West Bank. 
  [LIBERATION] Is it possible, despite everything, to think 
that the withdrawal of the Israeli army from Gaza and Jericho 
will be achieved on 13 April, as planned, or will there be 
further delays? 
  [Rabin] It is preferable to devote more time to clarifying 
everything which can be clarified to avoid conflicts and 
misunderstandings later. Once an agreement has been reached -- 
an agreement which does not give rise to differences of 
interpretation -- the implementation will be all the quicker. 
There are no sacrosanct dates. 
  Each phase must be negotiated, as stipulated in the 
Declaration of Principles. This is not the same thing as 
negotiating with the three neighboring states and with the PLO. 
In the first case, once a peace agreement has been achieved, 
each will be within its borders. With the Palestinians, we must 
achieve peaceful coexistence among two entities whose past 
history has shown that they do not have much liking for each 
other and which, moreover, are closely intertwined. The risks 
of friction are so high that we must define everything in the 
finest detail. Who will be responsible for what? What will be 
the instruments of cooperation and coordination between us? If 
we do not answer those questions, there will be general chaos. 
  [LIBERATION] Are you not afraid that the delays in the 
implementation of the agreement might encourage the 
oppositionists in the two camps? 
  [Rabin] I will not deny that these delays reduce the support 
for the agreement both among the Palestinians and the Israelis. 
The Hamas extremists are determined to step up terrorism, 
hoping to strengthen the Israelis' reactions of rejection. The 
same thing applies with regard to the PLO and the Palestinians 
who approve of the agreement. But I think that as soon as we 
put the agreement into practice, we will overcome the current 
problems. 
  [LIBERATION] After the meeting in Geneva between Hafiz 
al-Asad and Bill Clinton, can we expect rapid progress in your 
negotiations with Syria? 
  [Rabin] I hope so. But it is important to understand the 
problem. In a democracy like Israel, it is impossible to solve 
a crucial problem without the assent of public opinion, at least 
the majority of public opinion. Remember the peace agreement 
with Egypt. It was possible because President al-Sadat, 
visiting Jerusalem, convinced the Israelis of his peaceful 
intentions by his speech to the Knesset. He thus wiped away the 
hatred and suspicion built up over 28 years of conflict. 
President al-Asad has not come 2 percent of the way traveled by 
President al-Sadat to win over Israeli public opinion. When, 
during the Geneva news conference, an American journalist 
questioned President al-Asad about the meaning he gave to the 
word "peace," he allowed Bill Clinton to answer for him. 
  [LIBERATION] Do you hope that Hafiz al-Asad will be able to 
follow President al-Sadat's example? 
  [Rabin] I do not expect him to do so. But, at some stage, 
the two countries' foreign ministers will have to meet. We have 
asked for there to be discreet preliminary talks at a relatively 
high level. Following his recent visit to Damascus, U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced to us that the 
Syrian president had accepted our proposal. What has he in fact 
done? He has appointed the head of the Syrian delegation -- 
Deputy Foreign Minister Ambassador al-'Allaf. 
  [LIBERATION] You have announced that you want to put any 
agreement with Syria to a referendum. Can you tell us more 
about that? 
  [Rabin] The question of whether or not to make peace with 
Syria is a crucial problem, as is accepting a major withdrawal 
from the Golan Heights. There must be no misunderstanding or 
opposition on this subject. I think that the best thing is to 
allow the people to decide. All stable democracies hold 
referendums on major issues. Why should Israel not do so on a 
subject which is even more vital, not only for its prosperity 
but for its security? 
  [LIBERATION] Why not hold a referendum on the whole peace 
process, as your opposition is demanding? 
  [Rabin] Peace with Syria and the loss of most of the Golan 
Heights are much more important questions than peace with 
Lebanon or Jordan, which does not involve any territorial 
problem and does not affect the borders. With regard to 
Palestinian autonomy, I think I have a mandate from the voters. 
  [LIBERATION] What will happen if the answer is no? 
  [Rabin] I do not want to answer hypothetical questions. I 
think that the Israeli people want peace. Of course, I cannot 
be absolutely certain of the result. But we first need clear 
indications about what peace means for Syria, what the 
territorial price is, what the security arrangements will be, 
the timetable for withdrawal, the link between peace and this 
withdrawal, and so forth. I will then be able to ask the 
question: Are you in favor of this peace agreement? And the 
answer can only be yes or no. 
  [LIBERATION] In your recent statements, you seem to give 
real credence to President al-Asad. Why? 
  [Rabin] Hafiz al-Asad has two faces. On the one hand, he 
encourages -- especially since the agreement with the PLO was 
signed -- the terrorism of the 10 Palestinian organizations 
opposed to the agreement which have their headquarters in 
Damascus, and the terrorism of Hizballah in Lebanon. At least 
he does nothing to end it. But we also know that Hafiz al-Asad 
keeps his word. The respecting of the agreement on withdrawal 
from the Golan Heights signed with Syria in May 1974 is evidence 
of that. 
  [LIBERATION] In domestic political terms, do you nonetheless 
think you can pursue the two negotiations with the PLO and Syria 
at the same time? 
  [Rabin] In the parliamentary sphere, there is no doubt that 
I only have a majority of one seat. But while I have the 
majority, I am determined to go ahead. By announcing the use of 
the referendum on the question of peace with Syria, I think I 
have increased the chances of being able to advance on the two 
fronts. 
  [LIBERATION] Are we to understand that your decision to hold 
the referendum is definite? 
  [Rabin] Undoubtedly. We need a specific law, because the 
use of the referendum is not a provision which exists in Israel. 
When we have achieved the kind of agreement which the 
government, or the majority of the cabinet, can propose for the 
people's approval, we will refer this matter to the Knesset.

  [Excerpts] Reports summing up the Central Command's 
activity in 1993 reveal that, from the beginning of 1988 to the 
end of 1993, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] demolished 205 
houses of Palestinians who were involved in terrorist 
activities, sealed 228 houses, and sealed off 146 alleys. 
[passage omitted] 
  In 1993, the Central Command carried out 1,456 special 
operations. This figure includes operations by the Duvdevan 
undercover unit and operations to capture fugitives. March 
registered a record number of operations -- 156. 
  A soldier was lightly injured when stones were thrown at an 
IDF patrol in Gaza yesterday. He was treated and sent back to 
his unit. 
  A resident of Rafah who was digging in his field was 
surprised to find 28 land mines yesterday. He summoned the IDF 
and the defense forces which detonated the mines. IDF sources 
reported that the man was held for interrogation, but it is 
believed that he was not involved in planting the mines and that 
they were placed there by terrorists. 
  Two Palestinians were murdered yesterday on suspicion of 
collaborating with the Israeli authorities. [passage omitted] 
  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and Fatah have recently 
been conducting a campaign of murdering suspected collaborators. 
  Palestinian sources yesterday reported a series of incidents 
in the territories in which four residents were injured.

  [Text] Three IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers were 
slightly injured by a grenade thrown at them in Rafah this 
afternoon. Our army affairs correspondent Alon Ben-David 
reports that the three were evacuated to hospital, and IDF 
troops launched searches for the perpetrators. 
  Two Arab residents were wounded by soldiers gunfire in Gaza 
this afternoon. Our correspondent Shlomi Eldar reports that as 
a soccer game between Gaza and Rafah teams was in progress, IDF 
soldiers entered the field to pursue an armed suspect. While in 
pursuit, they were pelted with stones by the spectators. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1700 GMT on 29 January 
adds: "Last night in Rafah, IDF soldiers captured a Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement] terrorist carrying a Kalashnikov 
and ammunition. 
  ["A Molotov cocktail was thrown at a Border Police patrol 
near Abu-Dis tonight. The bottle shattered and ignited, but no 
one was hurt and no damage was caused."] 
  Fatah figures have expressed satisfaction with the results 
of 
the elections to the Gaza Strip Engineers Association, in which 
Fatah representatives were elected to four out of the nine 
seats, with Islamic Jihad and Hamas, which ran on a joint list, 
gaining the other four seats. [The ninth seat is to be held by 
rotation.] The elected chairman is Sa'id Khurama from Fatah. 
Our correspondent in the south notes that because of Fatah's 
dire financial condition, by comparison to other organizations, 
Fatah had been unable to achieve better results in the election 
campaign, with many candidates defecting to Hamas as a result of 
Fatah's inability to pay salaries.

<F P=106> [Dispatch by Randah Habib from Amman] </F>
  [Excerpt] Crown Prince Hasan has led a delegation to 
receive the body of Jordanian diplomat Na'ib 'Umran 
al-Ma'ayitah, which has arrived in Amman aboard a military 
plane, following his assassination in Beirut in front of his 
residence. The coffin, which was wrapped in Jordanian flag, was 
taken off the plane while the members of Na'ib's family shouted: 
Allahu Akbar [God is great], O martyr of Jordan. 
  Official Jordanian sources have ruled out any personal 
motive 
behind this operation because it was carried out in an organized 
way. The Jordanian officials, who do not see any clear 
explanation for the assassination, noted that it is linked with 
extremist elements, perhaps against the background of Jordan's 
involvement in the peace process. Amman is waiting for the 
results of the ongoing investigations in Lebanon and asked to be 
briefed on the results as details are available. [passage

<F P=106> [From the "News at Ten" program] </F>
  [Text] His majesty the king denounced the assassination of 
a Jordanian diplomat in Beirut, and said that treacherous crimes 
committed against us would only increase our determination to 
continue in our path as one family. In a message to His Royal 
Highness Crown Prince Hasan, the regent, the king said that 
Jordanians are the soldiers of the nation who are not afraid of 
death to defend its rights and to secure life and peace. His 
majesty said the rats and the bats of the night, whether 
ordering or executing the murder, will be disgraced till 
doomsday. 
  The body of Jordanian diplomat Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah, who was 
assassinated in Lebanon this morning, was brought back home 
tonight. His Royal Highness Crown Prince Hasan, the regent, 
accompanied by the prime minister and several other officials, 
as well as his family members, were at the airport to receive 
the body. The regent described the killing as a heinous crime, 
and said Jordan would seek the culprits out and bring them to 
justice. 
  [Begin recording] [Hasan] It is too early to tell. It is a 
heinous crime. It is another outrage against Jordanian 
diplomats abroad. And we are certainly going to make every 
serious, determined effort to find them out and to bring them to 
justice. 
  [Reporter] Will you file a protest with the Lebanese 
Government? 
  [Hasan] The Lebanese Government have been extremely helpful, 
extremely concerned. The prime minister was in touch with our 
embassy this morning, as were the Lebanese foreign minister and 
minister of interior. We appreciate this strong stand. 
  [Reporter] How do you feel about that? It is a sad story? 
  [Hasan] I think it is an outrage that proves once again that 
individuals and innocents pay the price when criminals are 
(?abroad). And that this is something that this country will 
never accept. We shall continue to do every thing in our power 
to bring the perpetrators to justice. 
  [Reporter] Do you think that this was an act against the 
peace process? 
  [Hasan] Well, it is certainly against every thing that 
civilized [words indistinct] in this part of the world and the 
world .... 
  [Reporter] Thank you. 
  [Hasan] Thank you. [end recording] 
  Forty-three-old Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah, a counselor at the 
Jordanian Embassy in Beirut was gunned down as he was leaving to 
work. Lebanese police said a lone assassin with an unarmed 
accomplice went up to al-Ma'ayitah's car and pumped at least 
seven bullets through the driver's window. Al-Ma'aytiah died 
instantly as most of the bullets from a 9 mm pistol hit his head 
and neck. There was no immediate claims of responsibility or 
clues as to the motives of the assassination, the first such 
crime against a foreign diplomat in Lebanon since 1987. Police 
officials said the killer and the accomplice escaped possibly in 
a car waiting close by. 
  Al-Ma'ayitah, who had been serving in Lebanon for about one 
year, is survived by his wife and two sons and a daughter.

of Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali and the ministers. 
The House discussed a number of its agenda items. Details are

  At the outset of the session and before discussing the

attack on late martyr Na'ib 'Umran al-Ma'ayitah, counselor at 
the Jordanian Embassy in Beirut. [passage omitted] 
  The House agreed to issue a statement denouncing this 
heinous 
crime. Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali said that the 
Jordanian Government is in constant contact with the Lebanese 
Government and will be kept informed about the investigations in 
this case as Jordan has asked to take part in these 
investigations. 
  Dr. al-Majali said: [Begin al-Majali recording] In fact, 
there have been contacts with the Lebanese Government between 
the minister of interior and his counterpart over there [word 
indistinct] on the investigations. They said that there are 
vague leads and we have asked to take part somehow in order to 
be directly informed about developments. So far there are no 
fingers pointing to any particular party. However, when such 
developments take place, we will inform the House, thank you. 
[end recording] 
  Afterwards, the House began to discuss items on the agenda. 
The House listened to the government's response to questions 
posed by a number of deputies dealing with citizens' public 
affairs.

  [Text] A Lebanese Foreign Ministry delegation, led by Zafir 
al-Hasan, the Ministry's secretary general, arrived in Amman 
this morning to offer condolences on behalf of the Lebanese 
Government and people on the martyrdom of the late Na'ib 'Umran 
al-Ma'ayitah, the counselor at the Jordanian Embassy in Beirut, 
who was assassinated by criminal terrorists in Beirut last 
Saturday. 
  On arrival at Queen Alia International Airport, al-Hasan 
said: The crime that was committed was an ugly crime, and we 
strongly condemn it. We feel great sorrow over the martyrdom of 
the Jordanian diplomat because the victim was one of our 
Jordanian brothers. 
  He added: We bow with appreciation to martyr al-Ma'ayitah 
because he offered much during his mission. We in Lebanon, and 
on all levels, are doing all we can to identify and punish the 
criminals. He emphasized Lebanon's readiness to cooperate with 
Jordan in order to secure their arrest. 
  He voiced sincerest condolences in the name of 
Lebanon--president, government, and people--on the martyrdom of 
the Jordanian diplomat, and said: We offer our heartfelt and 
sincerest condolences to Jordan--king, government, and 
people--and to the martyr's family.

<F P=106> [From the "News at Ten" program] </F>
  [Text] The prime minister, 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, 
returned home from the United States after accompanying his 
majesty the king on his visit to Washington and after holding 
talks at the United Nations on the effects of the sanctions on 
Jordan. The prime minister described his majesty the king's 
visit and talks in Washington as very successful. He told the 
News at Ten that he had also briefed the UN Sanctions Committee 
on Jordan's losses due to the sanctions imposed on Iraq and that 
the Committee had promised to cooperate with Jordan. 
  [Begin recording] [Al-Majali] The purpose of the meeting is 
to meet with the committee which has been appointed by the 
Security Council for the sanctions on Iraq. And I gave them a 
paper on this to show what is the damage to the Jordan economy, 
especially to our factories, because Iraq is our main market for 
most of the industries in Jordan. And again, we explained to 
them how much we are affected by the inspection of the cargo in 
the high seas which has cost Jordan quite a lot in the last 
three years. They were very understanding and they were very 
cooperative. And, in fact, we discussed the procedures about 
this, that there should be a certain base as a policy for this, 
so we do not have to get into the routine towards this. And I 
met with the secretary general, as well, to exchange with him 
the views about the sanctions, and in the same time to discuss 
the peace process. 
  [Reporter] Have you received any promises from them? 
  [Al-Majali] I think they will be very serious in discussing 
all what we have put to them, and we asked that we should get 
contribution for the damage for our economy. And we hope that 
we will get it. In fact, when we were in the United States 
again we put the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the president 
about these things. And they both promised to help Jordan 
overcome these difficulties. [end recording]

  [Text] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali met in 
New York yesterday with the chairman and members of the UN 
Security Council Committee entrusted with implementing 
Resolution No. 661 of 1990 concerning the economic sanctions 
against Iraq. Al-Majali presented to them a report supported by 
ample studies and figures on Jordan's economic losses and 
difficulties and the negative effects on Jordan of its 
commitment to implementing this resolution. He emphasized his 
demands that the Council work for making good Jordan's losses, 
amounting to $300 million annually, as a result of its 
commitment to the Council's resolutions. 
  Backing his report with details and figures, the prime 
minister noted the complications and losses that affect the 
Jordanian economy, especially the sectors of transportation, 
transit, the free market, and the Gulf of Aqaba as a result of 
the inspection measures by international forces against all 
ships arriving and leaving the al-'Aqabah port. He explained 
the negative implications of this inspection for the Jordanian 
citizen who is living the stage of building democracy and 
peacemaking. 
  The prime minister answered questions by the committee put 
forward by the chairman who in turn promised to raise these 
issues and discuss them with all the committee members and give 
them priority consideration. 
  The meeting was attended by Information Minister Dr. Jawad 
al-'Anani, Finance Minister Sami Qammuh, and 'Adnan Abu-'Awdah, 
Jordan's permanent UN representative. 
  Last night, the prime minister met with UN Secretary General 
Dr, Butrus-Ghali and exchanged views with him on the peace 
process in the Middle East in light of the latest developments. 
The prime minister briefed the secretary general on the results 
and the course of the Jordanian-U.S. talks held recently in 
Washington between the Jordanian side under His Majesty King 
Husayn and the U.S. side under President Bill Clinton. The 
prime minister raised with the secretary general the issue of 
the negative effect on the Jordanian economy of Jordan's 
commitment to UN Security Council Resolution No. 661. 
  The secretary general expressed an understanding of the 
Jordanian complaint and of Jordan's suffering because of its 
commitment to implementing international legitimacy. 
  The meeting was attended by Information Minister Dr. Jawad 
al-'Anani, and Jordan's permanent UN representative 'Adnan 
Abu-'Awdah.

<F P=106> [Report by Hamdan al-Hajj] </F>
  [Text] Marwan Dudin, deputy head of the Jordanian 
delegation to the Jordanian-Israeli peace talks has called on 
the Arab League member states to meet without delay to discuss 
the amendment unanimously adopted by the U.S. Senate, which bans 
U.S. arms sales to countries boycotting U.S. companies that deal 
commercially with Israel. 
  In an exclusive statement to AL-DUSTUR, Dudin said it has 
become important that the Arab parties meet to discuss this 
subject very seriously so that the Arab measures will have a 
collective meaning, as did the original Arab League decision on 
the Arab boycott of Israel. 
  However, he said it is not strange that the U.S. Senate 
adopts such decisions that are supportive of, and openly biased 
toward Israel. This decision also shows disrespect for the 
broad relations between Arab countries and the United States. 
  He wondered how the U.S. Administration would be able to 
reconcile the Senate decision with the desire to activate U.S. 
arms sales to the Arab countries, especially the rich ones whose 
arms purchase figures are astronomical. 
  Dudin ruled out the possibility that the U.S. Administration 
could implement this decision unless implementation is 
accompanied by U.S. pressures on Britain, France, Russia, and 
other countries that compete with the United States in supplying 
Arab countries with weapons. 
  He expected the U.S. Administration to circumvent this 
decision by arguing that the peace process is at an advanced 
stage, and its success will lead, sooner or later, to the 
lifting of this boycott of Israel. 
  He said, however, that from the practical point of view, the 
decision may have one direct effect; it will intensify pressures 
on the Arab parties to the Arab-Israeli negotiations to expedite 
reaching reconciliation arrangements with Israel that are below 
these parties' aspirations, and said such an effect is very 
likely.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "No Signing of Agreements Before Resolving All </F>
Problems"] 
  [Text] Jordan has reiterated the need to resolve all 
problems with Israel before signing any peace agreement. There 
are many topics on the Jordanian-Israeli agenda that need urgent 
solution. There will be no solution if Israel does not 
acknowledge or respond to Jordan's requirements related to 
borders and occupied Jordanian territory, water and its fair 
distribution, or the issues of refugees who are still living in 
camps under the supervision of the United Nations Relief and 
Works Agency. 
  His Majesty King Husayn addressed these issues in his 
statements in the United States. He also presented them clearly 
in front of the representatives of the American Jewish 
communities and the members of the U.S. Council on Foreign 
Relations. No peace would be achieved if these rights were not 
recognized or the necessary and appropriate solutions were not 
reached. 
  King Husayn noted, in one of his statements, that he heard 
some suggestions saying: Why does Jordan not sign a peace 
agreement with Israel? The king's answer was: There will be no 
signing of agreements before reaching a just and comprehensive 
peace, not with Jordan only, but also with all involved Arab 
parties. We do not seek incomplete or fragile peace, but a 
peace that will be accepted by the coming generations. We seek 
a peace that will consolidate security and stability in the 
region; a peace that will pave the way for progress and 
prosperity in the region; and a peace that will provide an 
honorable life for people, relieve their suffering, fear, 
concern, and deprivation, and save them from the dangers of 
fighting and wars. 
  King Husayn wanted to reiterate this so that everybody will 
know that Jordan has not deviated from its sound national and 
pan-Arab course to which it has been adhering since the 
beginning of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Palestine 
question. Jordan will remain, despite all circumstances, the 
patient and indefatigable country which defends its rights and 
those of its nation with honor and truthfulness.

  [Excerpts] At 0930 today, gunmen assassinated Na'ib 'Umaran 
al-Ma'ayitah, first secretary at the Jordanian Embassy in 
Beirut, in front of his house in al-Rawshah as he prepared to go 
to the embassy offices in Saqiyat al-Janzir. [passage omitted] 
  A special Jordanian military plane carrying an official 
delegation headed by Foreign Ministry Secretary General Nayif 
al-Hadid arrived in Beirut this afternoon and transported the 
body of the diplomat to Jordan. At the airport to see the body 
off were Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz and Jordanian Ambassador 
to Lebanon Fakhri Abu-Talib. The ambassador hoped the Lebanese 
authorities find the culprits and those behind them. He 
stressed that the Jordanian Embassy in Beirut will remain open. 
He said: 
  [Begin recording] [Abu-Talib] I believe the Lebanese 
officials have made enough statements about the attack. I 
cannot add to what they said. [passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] Do you believe the attack is politically 
motivated? 
  [Abu-Talib] I believe there certainly are political motives. 
There are no personal reasons for the killing. Someone is 
trying to harm both Jordan's march and Lebanon's security. 
Those who planned and carried out the attack do not want 
stability and security for Lebanon, nor do they want Jordan to 
continue its current political line. But despite all obstacles 
and difficulties, we will not change our policy, and we will 
take a courageous and responsible position. [passage omitted] 
[end recording] 
  For his part, Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz made the 
following statement: [Begin Buwayz recording] As I said this 
morning, this is a loss for Lebanon. It is a stab at Lebanon 
more than Jordan. Those who try to harm stability and security 
in Lebanon are also trying to harm Lebanon's credibility in the 
political and security spheres. Of course, I will not forestall 
the investigations and point accusing fingers at any quarter, 
but certainly the tragedy reflects negatively on Lebanon above 
all. 
  I express my condolences to the Jordanian officials and to 
the family of the victim, and I stress that the Lebanese 
Government will spare no effort in conducting investigations and 
finding the attackers. [end recording]

  [Text] Beirut, Jan 31 (AFP)--Investigators hunting for the 
killers of a Jordanian diplomat are hopeful of making arrests 
after witnesses provided descriptions and other information, 
Interior Minister Bisharah Mirhij said on Monday [31 January]. 
  A gunman shot dead embassy first secretary Na'ib 'Umran 
al-Ma'aiytah outside his Beirut home on Saturday and seized 
documents from his briefcase. 
  He was the first diplomat to be killed in Lebanon since the 
end of the 15-year civil war in 1990. 
  No group has claimed responsibility for the murder, which 
Jordan blamed on opponents of the Middle East peace process. 
  "Witnesses have given the security services a description of 
the killers," Mirhij told AFP. "This information could lead to 
their arrest," he said. 
  "Some witnesses also revealed that the killer seized a file 
from the Jordanian diplomat's car," he added. 
  According to the latest police report, al-Ma'aiytah, a 
42-year-old father of three, was killed when a gunman pumped 10 
bullets into his neck, head and chest as he sat in his Mercedes. 
  The killer then fled in another car with an accomplice. 
  Jordanian Foreign Ministry officials, citing Lebanese 
police, 
reported on Sunday that a file which al-Ma'aiytah had at the 
time of his killing had disappeared. 
  Jordan's ambassador in Lebanon, Fakhri Abu-Talib, said "the 
murder was planned and carried out by professionals and it could 
have taken place in any other country." 
  The killing came almost a week after Jordan's King Husayn 
said in Washington that he hoped to meet Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin to boost the chances for peace. 
  Several Palestinian and Lebanese groups opposed to the peace 
process, including pro-Iranian and pro-Syrian factions, are 
based in Beirut.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: The Washington talks are continuing 
among the heads of delegations taking part in the peace process. 
Although U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher hoped to 
achieve tangible progress, due to the practical atmosphere 
prevailing over the talks, all signs indicate that the Israelis 
are avoiding responding to any substantive questions posed to 
them, especially those concerning full withdrawal from the 
occupied Arab territories. The Israelis have adopted a policy 
of prevarication while showing flexibility in techniques only. 
  The stand of the Israeli negotiators in Washington reflects 
Yitzhaq Rabin's views, which have been described as a halfway 
policy. On every occasion, Rabin calls on the Arabs to convince 
Israel that they really want peace, given that the Arabs have 
repeatedly reaffirmed their desire to achieve peace. 
  The Arab trend toward peace does not need further evidence 
or 
proof. Syria has presented a lot in order to render the peace 
process a success and its efforts have enjoyed the international 
community's appreciation. Syria was the center of attention 
during the recent Geneva summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad 
and Bill Clinton. The latter clearly and frankly praised 
Syria's stands and its true efforts to achieve a just and 
comprehensive peace in the Middle East. President Clinton 
totally adopted President al-Asad's call for the peace of the 
brave--a just and honorable peace that removes the occupation 
and restores the rights to their owners. 
  From this we can see that Israel's prevarication has 
certainly not been caused by the doubts it is claims to have on 
Arab intentions for peace, especially Syria's intentions. It is 
caused by its desire to devour as much occupied Arab territories 
as possible under the pretexts of security, given that a firm 
peace is the ideal security guarantee for all the countries in 
the region. 
  It is no surprise that during his official address to the 
European Parliament in Strasbourg, Yitzhaq Rabin said he is not, 
and will never become, Israel's de Gaulle, in clear reference to 
[former] French President Charles de Gaulle's decision to 
withdraw from Algeria and recognize its independence. At the 
time, this decision was described as a brave and courageous 
decision and enjoyed world appreciation. Rabin added: Israel 
will very carefully explore the road until it is reassured of 
Syria's intentions toward peace and security. 
  It is clear to every observer that Israel, through its 
officials, is deliberately raising these doubts in order to put 
an end to the momentum of the peace process after the Geneva 
summit and to buffer the active and effective U.S. role. the 
Arabs understand peace as a full withdrawal from all their 
occupied territories -- not from half of these territories-- and 
a restoration of all their rights -- not having them restored in 
increments. 
  The halfway policy that Rabin is promoting is a flagrant 
attempt to circumvent the call for the peace of the brave and 
the world community's expectations that Israel will rise to the 
level of the Geneva summit and the desired peace in the Middle 
East. This is especially so since, after long years of feeding 
the Zionist community on Talmudic illusions, kindling 
fanaticism, and promoting expansionist schemes, the rulers of 
Israel have no alternative but to adopt a true and brave stand 
themselves and confide in the Israeli people the facts of the 
20th century and the requirements of peace, the foremost of 
which is a full withdrawal from the occupied territories and 
closing the chapter of Jewish settlements once and for all. 
  This bravery, which the world community is eagerly awaiting, 
has been frankly rejected by Rabin. Instead, he is still 
talking about the same security claims and fabricated doubts. 
It is natural for all of this to reflect on the Washington 
talks and for the Israeli negotiators to continue evading the 
requirements of the peace process and the necessary answers to 
substantive questions. 
  Because peace is an important and basic issue, on the fate 
of 
which the future of the region depends, the Arabs will continue 
talks until the end. The next days will reveal the extent of 
the rulers of Israel's response to the will of the world, the 
resolutions of the world community, and the results of the 
Geneva summit.

  [Text] Damascus, Jan 30 (AFP) -- The bilateral Arab-Israeli 
peace talks in Washington are proceeding in an "encouraging and 
positive atmosphere," the official AL-THAWRAH daily said here 
Sunday [30 January]. 
  In an editorial, the newspaper said U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher described the negotiations as "very 
promising," because "he noted how serious the Syrian position 
was." 
  The bilateral talks resumed Monday after a four-month break 
following the signing of the PLO-Israeli autonomy accord in 
September, which Syria condemned, arguing that separate deals 
undermined the Arab negotiating position. 
  "The negotiations will make progress if Israel conforms to 
the requirements of peace, but the search for a settlement will 
go back to square one if the Jewish state continues to stand by 
its previous positions," the newspaper said. 
  On Wednesday Christopher described as "very promising" the 
new format for the negotiations, with meetings restricted to the 
heads of the Israeli, Jordanian, Syrian, Lebanese and 
Palestinian delegations.

<F P=106> [Ahmad Muwaffaq Zaydan report: "Rabbani Tells AL-HAYAH: I </F>
Will Not Resign Even If International Intervention Takes Place"] 
  [Excerpts] Peshawar, Jeddah, AL-HAYAH -- The Afghan 
opposition yesterday announced its support for UN intervention 
to resolve the crisis between it and President Borhanoddin 
Rabbani. It accused Russia of interfering in Afghan internal 
affairs and of supporting the latter. 
  But the Afghan president told AL-HAYAH over the telephone 
that he rejects any proposals to internationalize the crisis in 
his country. He stressed that he would not relinquish power 
even if international military intervention takes place against 
him. [passage omitted] 
  Furthermore, Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani stressed 
that his forces are in control of the strategic city of Baghlan 
and the surrounding areas in northern Afghanistan. He said that 
Uzbek militia forces and Hezb-e Eslami forces have surrendered 
with all their military equipment to government forces. 
  In his statement to AL-HAYAH yesterday Rabbani rejected any 
offers to internationalize the Afghan crisis, because "it is 
primarily an Islamic problem and concerns Islamic institutions, 
organizations, and states." Rabbani denied that he intends to 
submit his resignation. He said, "I will not submit my 
resignation except after the remaining six months of my term 
have elapsed. I will not step down even if military and 
international intervention takes place. Because I refuse to 
surrender to pressure, conspiracies, and broken pledges. I am 
here because I was selected by all Afghan leaders." 
  Rabbani pointed out that "so far all mediations have failed 
to find a solution to the problem or secure a cease-fire."

<F P=106> [By Terence White] </F>
  [Text] Kabul, Jan 30 (AFP) -- Afghanistan's northern 
neighbour, the former Soviet republic of Uzbekistan, is accused 
of aiding a rebel faction fighting to overthrow President 
Borhanoddin Rabbani, according to an official spokesman in Kabul 
Sunday. 
  "We have clear-cut evidence about direct interference by 
Uzbekistan in the Kabul fighting," presidential spokesman Abdol 
Aziz Morad told AFP. 
  Morad said the former communist militia warlord, Uzbek 
General Abdol Rashid Dostam, who launched a failed coup attempt 
in the capital on New Year's Day, has received much military 
support for the one-month long Kabul factional fighting. 
  He went so far as to say that representatives of Dostam met 
with government officials in the Uzbek capital Tashkent in order 
to help plan the coup attempt in Kabul. 
  "Many facilities, both military and economic, have been put 
at Dostam's disposal by Uzbekistan," Morad said. 
  He accused Uzbekistan of not only supplying Dostam with 
jets, 
aircraft spare-parts and the construction of a military 
airstrip, but also of launching air-raids over Kabul and other 
targets from inside Uzbekistan itself. 
  Although Morad said it was not clear if the Uzbek 
interference in Afghanistan originated from the highest official 
level, he nevertheless demanded that a joint Afghan-Uzbek 
commission be appointed to investigate the charges. 
  The rumble of anti-aircraft fire over the capital followed 
three raids on Kabul by Dostam Jets before midday Sunday, with 
bombs exploding at the foot of the strategic "television 
mountain," which houses a lot of heavy artillery. 
  Meanwhile, fighting intensified Sunday in northern Baghlan 
province, where a spokesman for Hekmatyar's Hezb faction said an 
offensive by pro-Rabbani forces had been repulsed. 
  The coalition forces fire@ two long-range Luna missiles on 
the presidential troops in the Nahrin district, while infantry 
troops were also making advances towards the garrison, said Hezb 
spokesman Qaribur Rehman Saeed in the bordering Pakistani city 
of Peshawar. 
  He said one of the missiles, having a range of 80 to 90 
kilometers (53 miles), landed in the military base built by the 
former Soviet troops while the other landed in Nahrin's bazar. 
Details of the losses were not available, he said. 
  Saeed, giving importance to the opening of the new front in 
the north amid a slowdown in the Kabul fighting, said the 
anti-Rabbani coalition's strategy appeared to be to engage 
troops of the president's main commander, Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, in 
his northern strongholds and ultimately reach Jabalus Siraj. 
  The highway town of Jabalus Siraj, located in the south of 
Baghlan, is Mas'ud's last major base north of Kabul, he added. 
  He said Mas'ud had already brought troops to Kabul from his 
northern bases, and his Nahrin commander, Abdol Haye, was facing 
a shortage of manpower. 
  Morad was keen to note that pro-Rabbani jets, which fly out 
of the Soviet-built Bagram airbase 50 kilometres (31 miles) 
north of Kabul, are also active in the factional fighting. 
  Apart from the air raids, Kabul was largely spared the 
punishment of bombardment Sunday, with merely a handful of 
rockets exchanged and quiet frontlines; this unusual lull in 
hostilities prompted some locals to speculate on the prospect of 
a ceasefire. 
  Dostam's ally, Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar, is 
reported to be open to ceasefire negotiations if there was 
international backing, but his rival Rabbani appears sceptical 
of such moves. 
  "Neither the United Nations, the Organisation of Islamic 
Conference, nor any other foreign country has raised any popular 
and acceptable proposal to solve the Afghan crisis," Morad said. 
  Morad summarised by saying that the Dostam-Hekmatyar 
alliance 
has become weakened, was now on the defensive, and was looking 
for political solutions to its military problems.

joint investigation with Iranian officials and we will accept 
the results of this investigation, regardless of what they are. 
  The Turkish foreign minister also said: If such an incident

will not forego any measure to make up for it. Cetin added: We 
will not allow this issue to have a negative impact on the two 
countries' relations.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan 30 (A.A) -- Iran on Sunday accepted 
Turkey's offer to set up a special committee to investigate 
allegations that civilian villages were hit in Iran's border 
regions during Turkey's air strike on Friday against terrorist 
bases in northern Iraq, near the Turkish border. 
  AA was told by officials at the Iranian Foreign Ministry 
that 
Iran will not "at this point" ask for any compensation. 
  Iran had alleged on Friday that nine civilians from its 
border villages were killed during raids by Turkish war planes 
aiming at the terrorist bases in northern Iraq. 
  The Turkish Foreign Ministry for its part had stated that 
close inspection of the photographs taken of the area where the 
strike was held, showed that no such mistake was made.

  [Text] The deputy foreign minister for Asia and Oceania has 
said in a meeting with the Turkish ambassador to Tehran that an 
official apology from the Turkish Government and the payment of 
compensation for losses suffered by the victims of the tragic 
incident on the border between the two countries is the least 
that will be expected by the people of Iran. 
  Mr Borujerdi referred to the visit paid by the Turkish 
consul 
in Orumiyeh to the victims of the incident and said: The 
existence of these witnesses to the bombings must have removed 
any doubts Turkish officials may have had about the bombs 
falling around the Sar-e Dasht area. He added: The Islamic 
Republic of Iran strongly requests that the Turkish Government 
adopt measures ensuring that future military operations by that 
country in northern Iraq will not inflict any harm or damage to 
the Islamic Republic of Iran's borders, even if such operations 
take place close to our country's frontiers. 
  Mr. Haktanir, the Turkish ambassador to Tehran, for his part 
expressed deep regret over the tragic incident and said: The 
Iranian authorities and nation must rest assured that the plans 
of Turkey's military officials were to attack the positions of 
PKK guerrillas inside Iraqi territory, and that was precisely 
why we immediately sent a special fact-finding team to examine 
the situation close up with Iranian officials. He added: The 
Turkish Government will not forego any measure to make up for 
the losses inflicted, and the proposals of the Government of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran will be speedily conveyed to the 
Turkish authorities.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 31, IRNA -- An Iranian English daily, 
TEHRAN TIMES, today commented on the Friday attack of Turkish 
fighters on Kurdish bases inside Iraq and suggested that a 
permanent solution could be found through sincere and combined 
political efforts of Iran, Turkey, Iraq and Syria. During the 
attack, the fighters also fired on Iranian border villages, 
killing and injuring 28 Iranian nationals. 
  The daily cautioned in its editorial that the Kurdish 
problem 
was becoming increasingly dangerous for the entire region. 
  "In recent decades the `Kurdish' card has been used by the 
region's countries as a weapon to intimidate each other," it 
said. This policy would have worked for a short while, the daily 
added, "but the recent involvement of Western powers in this 
affair will inevitably endanger the territorial sovereignty of 
all the countries involved." 
  The daily recommended regional countries to set aside their 
differences and work out a practical peaceful solution to this 
common problem "whose main victims are the Muslim Kurdish 
civilians." 
  "When the Turkish Government issues diplomatic passports for 
Iraqi Kurdish leaders and supports them in their efforts to 
disintegrate Iraq, then it should not be upset when other 
countries help the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]," the daily 
said. It stressed that Turkey could not solve its Kurdish 
problem by "sending 50, or even 500 fighter bombers to massacre 
the Kurds." 
  The editorial concluded by calling for an end to the "game 
of 
politico-military one-upmanship, played by the regional powers 
using the Kurdish card."

  [Text] The Islamic Republic of Iran described the recent 
claims of the head of the CIA about Tehran's support for 
terrorist groups and Iran's attempts to obtain nuclear weapons 
as the futile repetition of Washington's previous policies. 
  The Islamic Republic of Iran's mission at the United Nations 
issued a communique last night describing the repetition of such 
allegations as the continuation of Washington's efforts to exert 
pressure on Iran and achieve the U.S. Government's political 
motives. 
  The head of the CIA has said at a session of the U.S. Senate 
Select Committee on Intelligence that the Islamic Republic of 
Iran supports terrorism and endeavors to obtain nuclear weapons. 
  The communique issued by our country's office at the United 
Nations explains that the Islamic Republic of Iran is itself a 
victim of terrorism and that during their inspctions of our 
country's nuclear sites, the International Atomic Energy Agency 
experts have testified that the U.S. claims are false.

<F P=106> [Friday prayers second sermon delivered by Ayatollah </F>
Mohammad Yazdi, head of the judiciary, in Tehran on 28 January 
-- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. [passage omitted: prayers, inviting worshippers 
to observe piety and importance of the revolution anniversary 
celebrations] 
  Another issue, to which I will briefly refer, is the issue 
of 
cooperation between the esteemed government and the Majlis. It 
is a pleasure to see those two big powers have full cooperation 
and understanding, particularly in important issues such as the 
1373 [year starting 21 March 1994] budget and the Second 
Five-Year Development Plan. They will solve the problems through 
close consultation and understanding. God willing, both powers 
will perform their duties. 
  I ask the esteemed deputies to be coherent, as much as 
possible, and consider the future. Do not look at issues on an 
individual basis and through the sole consideration of your own 
constituency. Look at them according to the constitution, state 
laws, and in relation with the world. In fact, look at the 
current and future effects of those issues. You yourselves are, 
more than anyone else, aware of the important role of this kind 
of outlook. I ask the esteemed government, and particularly the 
esteemed ministers who have a role in the budget issues and the 
plan -- on which all cabinet ministers play a role -- to make 
the most use of experts and other consultants who may even not 
be so famous. The more a decision is based on expert and 
scientific opinion, the better its effects. [passage omitted] 
  The first duty of judicial power is to monitor the best 
implementation of the laws and confront the violators at 
different levels. I apologize that I cannot mention the 
violators' names, whether government affiliated or not, who may 
exist in various offices, ministries, and organizations. They 
have been confronted and they will be confronted. We have had 
some cases, which I do not want to mention here. It is not good 
to go on a platform and talk about shortcomings. 
  I would like to say here that your country's judicial 
apparatus is using all its power and all the supervisory devices 
at its disposal to supervise the rule of law in the country and 
confront the offenders. There are other organs that help the 
judiciary perform its duties properly, such as intelligence 
bodies, and law enforcement and popular forces. Now there might 
be an individual case who may come to me or to you, and faced 
with this situation I should not interpret this in a special way 
and raise the question: What is the government up to? This is 
why I stress the importance of a holistic and generalistic 
outlook and far-sightedess. 
  Now to the issue of Afghanistan. I would like to call on my 
Muslims brothers and tell them: O brothers! Enough is enough. 
Do not destroy your country any more. Do not fight against one 
another any more. Why do you not put your weapons away and sit 
together and talk to resolve your issues and reform your 
country? Do not constantly associate yourselves with certain 
bodies and create this ugly situation that might prompt someone 
to question Islam's ability to manage and rule, God forbid. It 
was under the banner of Islam that you succeeded in deposing the 
previous regime and then set out to establish an Islamic 
government. Can you not see our country, where in a very short 
period of time all the internal squabbles came to an end and the 
late Imam [Khomeyni], may he be admitted to God's paradise, put 
a stop to all the arguments? Of course we had different 
opinions here, and we still do, and we always will. Such 
differences are only natural. However, how long do you intend 
to inflict so much destruction on a poor country? Enough is 
enough; stop the civil war! 
  Now to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Given what you all know, one is 
really ashamed of all the international organizations, which 
according to what has recently been announced, have issued 
nearly 30 resolutions, only one of which has been implemented. 
This is the one preventing Bosnia-Herzegovina from defend 
itself. They have implemented this resolution pretty well, while 
nothing has been done about the rest; nothing of course but idle 
words. They are all after the partition of that Islamic land 
and the suppression of the Muslims. However, we are confident 
that the Muslims, under any condition, will not be prepared to 
suffer shame, and they will not concede to the partition of 
their country, no matter what hardship they have to endure. 
[crowd chants] 
  As the compromise agreement progresses both sides realize 
what the situation is. The fact that Rabin said we would not 
even retreat from the Golan Heights and the occupied lands shows 
how things are. Optimists should realize what the final outcome 
will be. We are certain that the home of Palestinians belongs 
to the Palestinians and that they should return to their home. 
  My time is up. There are two or three more issues that I 
will not talk about, but simply refer to. The approval of the 
Dutch Senate in connection with a legal and judicial matter -- 
with a majority of three -- that prescribes mercy killing, as 
they put it, is definitely rejected and condemned in our view, 
as the judicial and legal system of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran. It is not correct to kill a patient even in the last 
moments of his life, out of mercy and for a quicker release. 
  The remarks made by the head of the Turkish Constituent 
Court 
[as heard] are totally rejected by us. Fortunately, some 
Muslims in Turkey--and another fortunate thing was that the 
prime minister himself was involved in the matter--have rejected 
his remarks. That gentleman thinks--I am speaking for the 
judicial sector--that he can say anything he wants when he is in 
court. He says Islam cannot be considered as a system of 
government. What he has said is pointless. That judge should 
be told: You might be of high rank, but your legal knowledge is 
very poor, let alone your Islamic knowledge. You should 
reconsider. [passage omitted: Koranic verses]

  [Text] Tehran, Jan 31 (AFP)--The Iranian Armenian leader of 
a Middle Eastern Protestant sect has been found dead after going 
missing two weeks ago, his Assembly of God church said here 
Monday. 
  A church source told AFP that the police had informed them 
on 
Sunday that the body of Mike Hovsepian [first name as received] 
were [plural as received] found in an alley in Eslamabad, a 
suburb of Karaj, 45 kilometers (30 miles) west of here. 
  Hovsepian, 49, had been killed on January 20, he said. 
  The official media has not reported the killing and the 
police not publicly announced it. But relatives of the victim, 
who have seen pictures of the body, said it had knife wounds. 
  The church officials said last week that Hovsepian had 
disappeared on January 29 [timeframe as received] on the way to 
Mehrabad airport in Tehran to receive a guest arriving from the 
central city of Esfahan. 
  A police official, quoted by the daily SALAM, denied 
Hovsepian had been arrested. 
  The Assembly of God has members in several countries of the 
Middle East, around 500 of them in Iran, including Armenians, 
Assyrians and Farsi-speakers, according to Protestant church 
sources. 
  [In a related report, Tehran SALAM in Persian on 25 January 
adds the following: "The Law Enforcement forces of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran are investigating the disappearance of a 
Christian clergyman in Tehran. 
  ["Asked by our correspondent about the disappearance of the 
Christian priest, and denying allegations of his arrest or 
detention, one Law Enforcement official said yesterday: For 
some time, this Christian clergyman had been missing and the Law 
Enforcement forces were investigating his disappearance. 
  ["In a newscast on 23 January, BBC radio carried negative 
propaganda against Iran with a report claiming that concern for 
the safety of a Christian cleric in Iran was increasing. 
  ["The radio added: A senior Christian evangelist [Enjili] in 
Tehran has been missing since 19 January. 
  ["The cleric Mikailyan, who is an official of the 
Evangelical 
Armenian Church of Tehran, spoke to our correspondent last night 
about the [missing] clergyman and said: Hayk Hovsepian, who is 
the head of the Assembly of God Church, left for Iran to receiv? 
a family member coming to Iran from Spain. He went to 
[Tehran's] Mehrabad airport. Since then, there has been no news 
of Hayk's whereabouts. 
  ["Mikailyan said that Hayk's disappearance was reported to 
the Law Enforcement forces."]

  [Excerpts] On the occasion of the auspicious birthday 
anniversary of the savior of mankind, His Holiness Hojjat Bin 
al-Hasan, Mahdi, the lord of the age, may God hasten his advent, 
the participants in the general session of the Ahl al-Bayat 
[Prophet Muhammad's scion] world congress from Iran and 64 other 
countries today met his eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, guardian 
of the cause of Muslims, in Imam Khomeyni's mosque. 
  In this meeting, His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i began his 
speech by congratulating the auspicious birthday of the lord of 
the age, may God hasten his advent to the oppressed people and 
nations of the world, and the followers of the Ahl al-Bayt 
school of thought all over the world. [passage omitted] 
  His eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i considered the formation of 
the first ever powerful Islamic political system in Iran through 
the efforts of the followers of the Ahl al-Bayt--may peace be 
upon them--as a cause for pride among all Islamic sects and 
denominations. He said: The followers of the Ahl al-Bayt, may 
peace be upon them, have raised the flag of Islam and the Koran 
in this part of the world, and in continuation of the efforts 
and struggles by the family of purity and modesty, may peace be 
upon them, they have managed to rid Islam of oppression and 
alienation. Today, the Islamic system is a significant political 
rallying point devoted to serving Islam and the Muslims. 
[passage omitted] 
  His eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i then said that one of the 
main objectives of America, the world's domineering powers and 
their dependent political regimes, is to create a rift between 
the Shiites and the Sunnis. He added: The gathering of the 
followers of Ahl al-Bayt in Islamic Iran is step toward unifying 
the adherent of the great Koran. This gathering will also pave 
the way for unity in the Islamic world and understanding among 
all Islamic sects. The great nation of Iran praises God that it 
has been able to put all its integrity, might, and capability a 
global scale at the disposal of Islam and the Koran. 
  His eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i stressed the sensitivity of 
the Islamic republic of Iran toward the issues of Muslim 
nations, and said: The Muslim nation of Iran does not consider 
itself aloof from the problems of the Muslim nations. While 
refraining from interference in the affairs of other countries, 
Iran is carefully following the issues of the Islamic world, to 
which it attaches great importance. The Islamic republic of Iran 
considers the problems of Kashmir, Afghanistan, and the 
oppressed but courageous nations of Palestine and Lebanon, as 
its own problems, and makes endeavors on a global level to 
resolve them. 
  The leader of Islamic revolution expressed profound regret 
at 
the process of fratricide in Afghanistan, and set out to 
question the leaders of armed parties and groups in that 
country. He said: What excuses can the Afghan leaders give to 
the Afghan nation, and what justification can they provide for 
the Islamic community? They have managed to deliver the kind of 
blow to the Afghan nation that the communists had not been able 
to deliver. They must know that the Islamic Ummah will question 
those individuals who inflict so much destruction and bloodbath 
on a nation on the grounds of sectarian, partisan, and personal 
issues. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Ankara in the Trap of Political </F>
Deception"] 
  [Text] Ezer Weizman, the president of the Zionist regime, 
is expected to arrive in Ankara for a four-day visit, something 
that is considered very important and vital for Ankara as well 
as for Tel Aviv. 
  Weizman's trip, which can be considered the first official 
trip by the head of the usurping Jerusalem regime to Turkey, 
follows trips by the Turkish foreign minister and the tourism 
minister to occupied Palestine. 
  The desire for such frequent visits at this level was not 
confined to Turkish echelons; Tel Aviv officials also insist on 
such meetings and exchanges. But both sides seem to have their 
own reasons and justifications for such visits. 
  Most political experts believe that in view of the trend of 
current events and efforts by most Arab governments to forge 
relations with the Zionist regime, Ankara seeks to accelerate 
the improvement of its relations with that regime and to exploit 
the trend of regional developments for its own good. 
  Ever since rounds of talks have paved the way for a 
compromise between the regional governments and the Zionist 
regime, Turkey has sought to become a link. This is what 
Ankara's officials hope for and the more their relations with 
the Zionists improve, the more this hope is boosted. 
  So, acquiring a false sense of popularity among the Arab 
governments involved in these talks has always been a reason for 
broadening its political relations with Tel Aviv's officials. 
  Among the other reasons Turkish officials insist on 
expanding 
relations with the occupying Zionist regime is to elicit greater 
economic and political support from the West. This economic 
support is needed to solve Turkey's problems such as its rising 
budget deficit, the daily depreciation of its currency, and the 
proliferating losses by Turkish economic institutions. 
  Lobbying for such support in the political arena is 
necessary 
to pander to the European government to end opposition to 
Ankara's wish to enter the EC's common market. Long have the 
Turks been groveling before various governments on the continent 
to enter the EC's common market. But because the entire Turkish 
population is Muslim, there has been opposition to this Turkish 
aspiration each time. So, Turkish officials now sense that 
broadening relations with Israel might be a major step toward 
creating change in the stances of European governments in this 
regard. 
  Strengthening and broadening Turkey's relations with the 
Zionist regime--as was stated earlier--is also a Zionist wish. 
For quite some time, the wave of Islamism has proliferated in 
the region and perturbed the Zionists. Their officials have 
expressed their apprehension at this mounting trend of Islamism 
in the region and have initiated efforts to combat it. The 
intelligentsia believe that because of the presence of strong 
anti-Zionist sentiment among the Muslim nations in the region, 
especially among the Turkish Muslims, the despots of Jerusalem 
have, for quite some time, taken steps to mitigate such 
sensitivity. They feel that every development in expanding 
relations with Turkey or with any government in the Middle East 
will be construed as a step on the path toward achieving this 
objective. 
  According to experts in regional affairs, using Turkey as a 
bridge for an effective presence in these strategic and 
geopolitical [preceding word in English] regions of Central Asia 
and the Caucasus is another reason for Tel Aviv's objective of 
expanding ties with Ankara. The Zionists are pursuing this 
particular strategy unilaterally with regard to Turkey. 
Informed observers say that there are 4,000 experts from the 
Zionist regime in the Central Asian republics engaged in 
economic, political, security, and propaganda activity. 
Naturally, expanding their activities demands that the Zionists 
have more extensive relations with the region's governments. 
  Most experts in regional affairs believe that broadening 
Ankara-Tel Aviv relations will benefit the usurping Zionist 
regime more. They believe that by broadening relations, greater 
benefits will accrue more quickly to the Zionist regime and that 
what is being given to Ankara are empty promises in the form of 
probable economic assistance or the creation of an atmosphere 
conducive to gaining some eventual benefits from regional 
circumstances. 
  All the Arab governments involved in talks with the 
occupying 
Jerusalem regime have constantly received similar promises from 
the Western countries to motivate them to expand relations with 
Tel Aviv. 
  But at least the experience of the past few months of the 
PLO-Israel compromise and the way in which 'Arafat and his 
associates have been deceived by this accord should prove an 
instructive experience for those who, in the Islamic region of 
the Middle East, are being drawn to soar on their wing toward 
the despots of holy Jerusalem.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] Discussions in Switzerland between PLO chief Yasir 
'Arafat and Shim'on Peres, foreign minister of the occupying 
Zionist regime, on differences regarding autonomy for Gaza and 
Jericho ended yesterday afternoon, but the problems have not 
been solved. 
  Differences continue to exist over the Jericho region, 
control of the Gaza-Jericho autonomous region's borders with 
Egypt and Jordan, and the security situation in the Zionist 
occupied settlements in Gaza and Jericho. 
  It is said that Yasir 'Arafat, representing the Palestinian 
side, lacks effective levers or pressure on the Zionist bully, 
and that he accepted some mediocre solutions in the Davos talks 
and passed on suggestions through Shim'on Peres, foreign 
minister of the Zionist regime, to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
of the occupying regime so that he could announce the final view 
regarding them. 
  At the end of yesterday's discussion 'Arafat tried again to 
create the illusion that differences between the Palestinian and 
Israeli sides are being solved, and hoped that a new agreement 
will soon be signed between Rabin and himself in the presence of 
Mubarak. However, Shim'on Peres declined to express hope over 
the Davos talks. 
  Some political analysts believe the failure to determine a 
date for signing the new agreement indicates the vagueness and 
lack of clarity rather than a definite outcome of talks between 
'Arafat and Peres -- in particular because it has been decided 
that they should continue the discussions in Cairo. 
  Meanwhile it seems that 'Arafat hopes, through concessions 
to 
the Zionist side, to take over the internal affairs of Gaza and 
Jericho soon. Thus 'Arafat's hopefulness is more a result of 
concessions to Israel but it is not clear whether the occupying 
regime will be satisfied with the new concessions, particularly 
because from the point of view of the Zionist regime the issue 
of controlling the borders of Gaza and Jericho with Egypt and 
Jordan is related to the security of the Zionist regime and this 
is not an issue over which Israel would easily come to an 
arrangement or hand over completely to the Palestinians. 
  From the point of view of the Zionist regime, the security 
of 
the occupiers is supreme to any form of credibility and it must 
be maintained at any cost, even with the violation of the 
security and national sovereignty of others. However, it is 
possible to predict that talks between 'Arafat and Tel Aviv will 
continue endlessly over differences and obstacles to the 
Gaza-Jericho plan. 
  'Arafat has burned all his bridges behind him and Israel 
feels that the present buoyant situation is in its interests 
because, without giving any rights to the Palestinians, it is 
receiving concessions from the Arabs and the West. This 
situation was predicted earlier because the autonomy agreement 
was designed to have sufficient ambiguity and contradictions as 
to allow excuses for delays to its implementation. 
  However, the problem is not limited to the Davos talks. The 
main crisis lies in the occupied lands. Israel has intensified 
its suppression and the Palestinians have intensified the 
conflict with the Zionist occupiers. The presence of 'Arafat's 
Fatah forces alongside the Islamists in confrontation with the 
Zionist regime is significant. This is an indication that 
'Arafat has lost the game not only to Israel. A more important 
card is the people of the occupied lands and the younger radical 
Fatah forces whom 'Arafat has lost to the Islamists and the 
Islamic intefada. 
  In the past few days, while discussions were under way 
between 'Arafat and Israel, radical Fatah youths carried out at 
least two anti-Israeli operations which indicate that 
differences between Fatah and 'Arafat are increasing.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres met his Egyptian 
counterpart 'Amr Musa in Davos this morning in anticipation of 
his meeting with Yasir 'Arafat this evening. The PLO chairman 
told a British diplomat the gap between the sides is wide and 
outside intervention is required to bridge it. 
  The Egyptian foreign minister will meet 'Arafat after the 
latter arrives in Davos this afternoon, and later he will hold 
another meeting with Peres. Mr. Peres expects a tough meeting 
with 'Arafat, perhaps the toughest so far at this stage of the 
talks. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 1300 GMT on 29 January 
reports that "Musa told Israel radio that he intends to mediate 
between Israel and the Palestinians prior to the Peres-'Arafat 
meeting tonight. The 'Arafat-Peres meeting is due to begin at 
2100, at first alone and then later with the heads of the two 
delegations.]

  [Text] Davos, Switzerland, Jan 30 (AFP) -- PLO officials 
Sunday [30 January] accused Israel of rolling back on agreements 
in their autonomy negotiations here, dampening optimism for 
conclusion of an early accord. 
  Their mood contrasted with the earlier heady prediction of 
PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat that a deal would be signed "very soon" 
on an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank town of Jericho and 
the Gaza Strip. 
  Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa had also said all major 
problems had been settled and an accord could be concluded 
within 10 days as a followup to the broad autonomy agreement 
signed in September. 
  But PLO officials said later that the Israelis had gone back 
on issues they thought were resolved. "Nothing is settled. 
There is no agreement," said one senior official, who asked not 
to be named. 
  They said that 'Arafat would have a third meeting Sunday 
night with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, who is due to 
leave for the United States in the early morning hours of Monday. 
  The discussions began Saturday with three major points 
outstanding: manning of international border crossings, the 
size of the Jericho autonomous area and the security of Jewish 
settlers. 
  Musa said the two sides agreed on the deployment of Israeli 
border guards, who would keep a discreet presence at frontier 
posts. 
  But Palestine Liberation Organisation officials said there 
was no agreement on the size of the Jericho autonomous area and 
there was no word on the question of security for the settlers.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent in the territories Yosi Torpstein] </F>
  [Text] Palestinian public support for Fatah, the largest 
and dominant organization in the PLO, is falling, while support 
for "independents," who prefer to avoid direct identification 
with the organizations supporting the Israel-PLO agreement or 
those opposing it, is steadily increasing. This transpires from 
a public opinion poll conducted on 16 January by the 
Nabulus-based Palestinian Research Center. The poll included 
1,607 interviewees from the West Bank and Gaza Strip. This 
research center started to conduct monthly polls after the 
signing of the agreement in order to assess the public mood 
among the Palestinian population and its possible voting 
patterns in the framework of democratic elections. 
  According to the agreement of principles, the elections for 
the autonomy council are slated to be held in July 1994 and the 
research center intends to continue conducting the polls until 
elections are held. Recently it was proposed that municipal 
elections be held in order to gauge the mood of the Palestinian 
voters in the territories. It has also been reported that the 
PLO leadership is even considering delaying the elections for 
the autonomy council. 
  According to the poll, support for Fatah has declined from 
approximately 42 percent in December to 35 percent in January. 
During this period support for the opposition organizations has 
not increased but remained stable. Support for Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] stands at 14.7 percent, whereas support for 
the Popular Front is 8.4 percent. At the same time the poll 
indicates that the coalition of the agreement's supporters made 
up of Fatah, FIDA [Palestinian Democratic Federation], and the 
Palestinian People's Party, is still stronger than the 
rejectionist coalition of Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Popular 
Front, and the Democratic Front. The agreement's supporters 
garnered approximately 39 percent, whereas the opposition 
accrued some 29 percent. The findings indicate that the 
contribution of FIDA and the People's Party to the supporters' 
camp is marginal and amounts to only a few percent. 
  The researchers assess that the voices lost to Fatah went to 
those supporting the "independents," especially the "national 
independents." According to the poll, support for the 
"independents" has gone up to 32 percent. The conductors of the 
poll estimate that some Fatah supporters preferred to define 
themselves as "national independents" or to abstain. They also 
assessed that some other independents are leaning toward the 
Muslim organizations or other organizations which have not 
defined their positions. 
  The poll shows that the lowest support for Fatah is to be 
found in Hebron, where only 24.6 percent support this 
organization. Had elections been carried out in Hebron on the 
day of the poll, the opposition organizations would have easily 
defeated the agreement's supporters. The greatest support for 
Fatah is to be found in Nabulus and Jericho (42.2 percent in 
both areas). The greatest support for the "independents" is to 
be found in East Jerusalem: 46.2 percent. 
  The researchers estimate that several factors contributed to 
the drop in support for Fatah. The main factors are the 
frustration and despair felt by the Palestinian population in 
view of the slow progress made in the negotiations; the absence 
of practical moves for implementing the agreement; the ongoing 
violence in the territories, for example, the killing of the 
four Hamas activists in Hebron two days prior to the poll; and 
the proliferation of arms in the Gaza Strip. The inter-Fatah 
arguments over appointments and democratic reforms also made a 
bad impression on the public. The researchers believe that all 
these factors have increased the Palestinian public's doubts 
over Israel's intentions and the ability of the Palestinian 
delegation to convince Israel to accept the Palestinian 
positions.

  [Text] Manama, Jan 30 (AFP) -- The head of a 16-member UN 
arms inspection team said here Sunday [30 January] his 
just-ended mission to Iraq was a success, adding that Iraqi 
officials had promised to cooperate in setting up a monitoring 
system. 
  "We achieved all objectives," said Russian team leader 
Nikita 
Smidovitch, who told reporters his 10-day mission to Iraq had 
been "successful." 
  Smidovitch was inspecting Iraq's military arsenal under UN 
Security Council Gulf war ceasefire resolutions. 
  "The Iraqis had a forthcoming attitude," Smidovitch said. 
"Iraq has promised to cooperate and said they will do what they 
can to shorten the period" needed to set the monitoring process 
in motion. 
  He was to leave Manama, the United Nations' base for Iraqi 
missions, late Sunday. 
  The long-term monitoring of the Iraqi arms program is 
crucial 
to Baghdad's hopes for an end to the embargo imposed after the 
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. By accepting Security 
Council Resolution 715, Iraq hopes to at least have UN sanctions 
on its oil exports lifted. 
  Asked how many missions were still needed before long-term 
monitoring could begin, Smidovitch replied? "Quite frankly, it 
will take time. We need more activities to set up the 
monitoring process." 
  The surveillance program is the next UN step following the 
destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction after the Gulf 
war of January-February 1991. 
  Iraq agreed to the surveillance in November after rejecting 
it for three years and has been lobbying hard for an end to the 
embargo. 
  On Wednesday, the UN's deputy disarmament chief said 
long-term monitoring of Baghdad's weapons program was still some 
way off despite Iraq's efforts to have sanctions lifted. 
  American Charles Duelfer, deputy head of the UN Special 
Commission (UNSCOM) disarming Iraq under the Gulf war ceasefire 
resolutions, spent five days in Iraq preparing a visit there 
this week by his boss Rolf Ekeus. 
  Ekeus is due to arrive in Baghdad on Tuesday to discuss 
monitoring, but has said he is unlikely to recommend a lifting 
of sanctions before the end of the year.

<F P=106> [Commentary by S. Vishwam of DECCAN CHRONICLE] </F>
  [Text] One cannot recall a stretch of time in 
India-Pakistan bilateral relations which was not characterized 
by strain, stresses and tensions. Indeed, during the last four 
decades the course of India-Pakistan relations has been variably 
been marked by a pattern which has by now become quite familiar 
to the students of South Asian politics. A prolonged period of 
confrontation and hostility leads to expression of the desire 
for normalization and friendship. This leads to some form of 
dialogue which arouses expectations in both the countries. The 
dialogue ends either in failure or in stalemate and relations 
are back to square one. 
  The recent foreign secretaries level dialogue was yet 
another 
attempt to broker peace between the two neighbors. The outcome 
was disappointing. In diplomatic parlance, it could be 
described as both sides agreeing to disagree. But instead of 
being put off by the failure, India has decided to go ahead and 
make one more attempt to induce Pakistan to try and remove some 
if not all of the irritants which (?clay) bilateral relations. 
This attempt was in the form of handing over six nonpapers 
containing detailed proposals in several key areas of contention 
in India-Pakistan relations by the foreign secretary, Mr. J.N. 
Dixit, to the Pakistan high commissioner in New Delhi. The 
initial response to the proposals from Islamabad has predictably 
been lukewarm, but one hopes that a detailed study of the six 
proposals would persuade Pakistan to be more responsive. 
  These proposals may not been spectacular or sensational, but 
they address issues which have aggravated tension and which 
because of that very reason needed to be got out of the way. 
Indeed, one of the most innovative among the proposals is the 
Indian offer in the arena of building confidence and removing 
mistrust of a no first-use of nuclear capability. This is to 
ensure regardless of whether or not the two countries possess 
nuclear capabilities that there is no chance of a nuclear 
confrontation between the two. The proposal is of benefit to 
both the countries and hence it ought to be acceptable to 
Pakistan. 
  Again, Islamabad should consider the proposal for creating 
an 
institutional mechanism to preserve peace and tranquility along 
the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir. Since the porous 
border has led to numerous instances of violations of the Line 
of Control, any mechanism which can monitor such violations and 
prevent them ought to be welcomed by Islamabad. It is worth 
remembering that agreement between India and China on the 
creation of an institutionalized mechanism along the border has 
actually resulted in trans-border tranquility and lessening of 
tension. There is no reason why a similar mechanism along the 
Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir cannot work. 
  The proposal for implementing the agreement on Siachen 
arrived at three or four years ago by the defense secretaries of 
the two countries is an earnest of India's sincerity in settling 
the Siachen issue once and for all. In fact, the suggestion for 
ensuring peace and tranquility along the Line of Control and the 
offer to implement the agreement on Siachen taken together 
constitute a major peace-offering on the part of India. Both 
countries have admitted that the Siachen agreement could not be 
implemented two years ago because of the absence of political 
will. Soon after returning to power after elections, the prime 
minister of Pakistan, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, had said that an 
agreement on Siachen would restore Pakistan's confidence in 
bilateral negotiations. By offering to implement such 
agreement, India is giving proof of its good faith. Indeed, the 
spirit in which the Indian proposals have been made are 
consistent with the spirit of the Simla Agreement of 1972. It 
is on such a basis that Islamabad must assess the six proposals. 
Islamabad demanding a plebiscite in Kashmir or raising the 
Kashmir issue at the UN Conference on Human Rights in Geneva 
will not take Pakistan too far.

  [Text] During extensive military operations by the Turkish 
Government inside northern Iraq against the positions of the 
Kurdistan Workers Party [PKK] guerrilas, who are opposed to the 
Turkish Government, a number of rockets and bombs hit a number 
of our country's border villages, killing nine Iranians and 
wounding 19. 
  After receiving the above news, our country's deputy foreign 
minister for Asia and Oceanic affairs telephoned Turkish Deputy 
Foreign Minister Bilgin Unan to express the deep concern of the 
Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for that tragic 
incident and called on the Turkish Government to give an 
explanation in that regard. 
  The deputy Turkish foreign minister said: The Turkish 
Government under no circumstances allows such operations inside 
Iranian territory, and yesterday's military operations were 
conducted following very precise calculations; they took place 
precisely inside Iraqi territory and were aimed at suppressing 
the PKK. The Turkish Government is ready to immediately dispach 
a team to the Islamic Republic of Iran to work under the 
supervision of the Iranian authorities to investigate the 
incident. He added: The Turkish Government will accept the 
outcome of the investigations. 
  When that telephone contact ended, the Iranian deputy 
foreign 
minsiter for Asia and Oceanic affairs told our correspondent 
that the Foreign Ministry is coordinating its efforts 
continuously with the Interior Ministry and other concerned 
organizations to follow up the case, the result of which will be 
announced later.

  [Text] In Mauritania the two main parties were unable to 
obtain an absolute majority in the local elections, which were 
held for the first time yesterday under multiparty conditions. 
The most striking feature of the elections was the failure of 
the candidates to gain the votes needed to prevent the holding 
of a second round of voting, which will take place on 4 February 
in all the municipalities where candidates were unable to gain 
more than 50 percent of the votes cast. 
  According to the official preliminary results, the 
Republican 
Democratic and Social Party and the Union of Democratic Forces 
[UFD] gained an equal number of votes, especially in the capital 
Nouakchott and the financial capital Noudibu. 
  In Nouakchott, the party of Mauritanian President Maaouiya 
Ould Sid Ahmed Taya gained 44.77 percent of the votes cast, 
while its rival the UFD, which is the most important opposition 
grouping, gained 42 percent of the votes in the capital. The 
Union for Democracy and Progress obtained 15 percent of the 
votes cast in a total of 208 municipalities in Mauritania.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Votes are being counted in Mauritania, which 
yesterday went to the polls to elect local government officials. 
The election is the first test of the government's popularity 
since presidential elections in 1992. The opposition has cried 
foul, alleging that voters had been bused into the towns from 
the countryside and that the ink used to mark the (?sums) of 
voters wasn't indelible. For their part, the government says 
the opposition forged identity cards. Now as Shayk Bekaye 
reports in this telex from Nouakchott, the first results are out: 
  [Begin studio announcer recording] The ruling party in 
Mauritania has taken the lead in local elections. Provisional 
results give President Ould Taya's Democratic and Social 
Republican Party, PRDS, 90 percent of seats in rural districts, 
except in the south where there are a majority of black 
Mauritanians who voted for the Union of Democratic Forces, the 
main opposition grouping. The opposition did much better in the 
cities. In Noaukchott and Nouadhibou, there will be a second 
round of voting on Friday [4 February] as no party managed to 
win an outright majority. The opposition also forced a second 
round in urban areas of the east, a surprise for observers, who 
had expected the ruling party to do well. 
  The PRDS did all it could to win in urban centers, 
mobilizing 
massive financial and material resources and the result is seen 
as setback for the popularity of Ould Taya. Officials of his 
party were keen to point out that conditions have changed since 
1992, when the government was accused of malpractice in 
presidential elections. Yesterday's voting brought accusations 
of cheating on all sides. Independent observers said some people 
were voting more than once but said both government and 
opposition supporters were involved. [end recording]

  [Text] Nouakchott, 30 Jan (AFP) -- The ruling Democratic 
and Social Republican Party [PRDS] is poised to win most of the 
208 communes, in spite of the strong showing of the Union of 
Democratic Forces (UFD), the main opposition party, according to 
official results of municipal elections published here this 
evening. 
  The PRDS of Mauritanian President Maaouiya Ould Sid'Ahmed 
Taya is expected to retain the majority in 160 communes while 
UFD is expected to win in at least 32 communes, an official 
source stated. Independent candidates have won about 20 towns, 
with the rate of participation at around 60 percent. The second 
round is slated for 4 February. Final results should be known 
tomorrow. 
  PRDS, UFD, and the Union for Democracy and Progress (UDP), 
the second opposition party, will be contesting the second 
ballot in about 10 communes including Nouakchott, the political 
capital, and Nouadhibou, the economic capital. In Nouakchott, 
PRDS obtained 44.77 percent of votes as against 42 percent for 
UFD. According to partial results, the two parties obtained 
identical percentages in Nouadhibou. The PRDS will also be 
contesting the second ballot at Nema and Aoun, two eastern towns 
where it had absolute majority. 
  The UDP, which was legalized in 1993, has already called on 
its voters to cast their votes for the UFD during the second 
round in areas where it came third. The municipal elections are 
being held two years after the first pluralist elections (March 
1992 presidential and legislative elections) and three years 
after the introduction of multiparty democracy into Mauritania.

  The ruling Republican Democratic and Social Party won 163 
municipalities. The Union of Democratic Forces "'Ahd Jadid" won 
16 municipalities. Independents won 18 municipalities. 
  There is some discrepancy between the total number of 
muncipalities won by the two parties given at the end of the 
report and the breakdown of the number of municipalities won in 
each province. In the breakdown the number of municipalities 
won by the ruling Republican Democratic and Social Party adds up 
to 164, the number of municipalities won by the Union of 
Democratic Forces adds up to 17 and the number of municipalities 
won by independents adds up to 18. That brings the number of 
municipalities decided in the first ballot to 199.

<F P=106> [Dispatch by Basim Abu-Sumayyah from the occupied territory] </F>
  [Text] Israeli and Palestinian sources have stressed that 
Israel and the PLO reached a final draft agreement to implement 
the Gaza-Jericho accord yesterday while meeting in Davos. 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres are expected to meet in Cairo in 10 days 
to sign the agreement. 
  Israeli sources said that the two sides are drafting the 
technical details of the agreement, which should begin to be 
implemented within the next two weeks. These sources added that 
the Davos draft agreement includes the following points: 
  -- Israel's demands and security requirements will be 
guaranteed; 
  -- Israel will control road junctions in the Gaza Strip; 
  -- Only Israeli police will carry out searches at the 
border crossings. Palestinian police will be present at these 
crossings; 
  -- The two sides will reach an understanding on the size 
of the Jericho area so that this matter will not constitute an 
obstacle in the talks. Israel will be flexible in this regard; 
  -- The citizens of the self-rule area will be able to move 
freely to the al-Nabi Musa, near Jericho, and al-Maghtis, on the 
Jordan River, to perform religious rites only; 
  -- The Palestinians in Gaza and Jericho will have access 
to the joint recreation area to be built between the Israelis 
and the Palestinians on the Dead Sea; 
  -- The passages leading to these areas will remain under 
Israeli military control; 
  -- Special passages for the self-rule residents to move 
about without restriction will be established. These passages 
will ultimately be linked to a highway linking Amman to the 
self-rule area across the King 'Abdallah Bridge. 
  -- Israel will have the right to protest the entry of 
suspect Palestinians; and 
  -- Special Israeli search rooms will be created at the 
border crossings. The Palestinian police will not be allowed in 
these search rooms.

  [Text] Cairo, 31 Jan (MENA)--Nabil Sha'th, Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat's political advisor, arrived in Cairo 
this evening from Switzerland after taking part in the meeting 
between 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in 
Davos. 
  Upon his arrival, Sha'th stated that 'Arafat and Peres will 
meet in Cairo on Sunday [6 February]. He noted that the 
Palestinian and Israeli delegations will meet tomorrow to 
prepare for the 'Arafat-Peres meeting on Sunday. 
  Sha'th expressed his belief that the Davos meeting has made 
some progress with respect to the difficult problems surrounding 
the Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  He said that if we reach agreement on Sunday, we will have 
overcome the stage of conflicts and advance to the signing of 
the agreement. 
  Sha'th clarified that an international presence at the 
crossings has been ruled out, but it is still our right to 
demand a temporary international presence in Gaza for a period 
of one or two years.

  [Text] Upon his arrival in Amman today, Palestinian 
Ambassador in Cairo Sa'id Kamal, told our correspondent that 
Israel is still studying the Palestinian paper presented by the 
PLO and that there is hope on the horizon. 
  [Begin recording] [Kamal] I can say that when I left Cairo 
for beloved Amman there was a paper comprising 12 contentious 
points. On the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, 
it was agreed that brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] and the 
Israeli foreign minister should meet to try to overcome these 
points, after Israel had a chance to study them, especially from 
the PLO's point of view. 
  I was somewhat cautious when I learned yesterday about the 
optimistic report that a compromise [previous word in English] 
was reached, because Mr. Rabin holds the reigns and has the 
final say. It became evident that, until this morning, the man 
was still studying the particular issue of security at crossing 
points, which is a sensitive issue to both the Palestinian and 
Israeli sides, as well as to the Jordanian and Egyptian sides. 
  Hence, there is a glimmer of hope on the horizon for another 
meeting before the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan in 
order to formulate the agreement. However, this must be 
preceded by a meeting that solves the problems over the issue of 
crossing points, especially the crossing point at Rafah. This 
is after Rabin announces that he is coming to Cairo, just as he 
announced earlier, to sign the final agreement on security 
preparations and withdrawal within the Gaza Strip and the 
Jericho area. 
  [Reporter] Besides the issue or problem of crossing points, 
are there other problems obstructing the agreement? 
  [Kamal] I believe that there are still stylistic issues 
rather than issues that are particularly sensitive to either 
side or to the Arab side, in general, especially to the Arab 
cordon states. [end recording]

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has said that some 
progress was made in the Davos talks, but no agreement has yet 
been reached between Israel and the PLO. Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres said last night that Israel and the PLO have 
overcome two or three of the toughest issues in the 
negotiations. The prime minister was speaking in a conference 
call with the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish 
Organizations, while the foreign minister also spoke in a 
conference call, but with Israeli journalists in Washington. 
Arye Golan reports from Washington: 
  [Begin recording] [Golan] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres 
will start a two-day visit to Washington this afternoon. The 
main event on the first day is a meeting with Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher to update him on the talks with 'Arafat in 
Davos. In a conference call from Florida, where he started his 
U.S. visit, Peres refused to detail the solutions worked out in 
Davos. 
  [Peres] We agreed on the contents, but we have not yet 
reached agreement on the wording. I did not want to draft it 
hastily or without holding consultations at home, because 
telephone consultations have their limitations. Since each word 
is important, I came to the conclusion that before we add our 
signature, it would be best to wait several days until I have 
the opportunity to speak with the prime minister and others 
involved in the talks. This requires a lot of time and 
patience, but I remain firm in my belief that we can reach a 
full agreement, although under no circumstances am I ready to 
say how long it will take. 
  [Golan] Both Prime Minister Rabin, in his conference call 
with the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish 
Organizations, and Foreign Minister Peres stress that the 
government will make sure that Israel remains responsible for 
overall security and that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will 
protect the settlements. Both promise the government will not 
compromise on security. 
  [Peres] We have not compromised and will not compromise on 
security matters, and we must be extremely careful in wording 
any agreement on security. As I have already said, I prefer to 
go over the draft word by word, because we have reviewed many 
drafts during the negotiating process. I would like the final 
draft to be acceptable to my colleagues, the prime minister in 
particular. 
  [Golan] Before Peres leaves the United States to continue 
the negotiations with 'Arafat in Cairo, he will confer here with 
Senate and House leaders, and tomorrow he will meet with Vice 
President Al Gore and National Security Adviser Anthony Lake.

  [Text] Cairo, Feb 1 (AFP) -- Israeli and PLO negotiators 
began top secret negotiations here Tuesday [1 February] on 
finalising an accord on Palestinian autonomy, a Palestinian 
delegation source said. 
  The location and duration of the talks as well as the 
make-up 
of the teams were not revealed. 
  The source said that the meeting was shrouded in the 
"greatest secrecy", and an Israeli diplomat here refused to give 
any details. 
  The talks are to prepare the ground for a meeting between 
Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and PLO leader Yasir 
'Arafat here on Sunday. 
  The two reported important progress when they met last 
weekend in Davos, Switzerland, although Israeli officials have 
been stressing that a final agreement will still take several 
weeks. 
  The outstanding disagreements include control of 
international border crossings, the size of the Jericho 
autonomous area and security for Jewish settlements. 
  PLO chief negotiator Nabil Sha'th said Monday that the two 
sides in Davos "managed to resolve all problems concerning Gaza, 
Jericho and the crossing points" but added: "I don't want to be 
too optimistic, because stumbling blocks sometimes emerge for 
reasons beyond our control." 
  He had said the two sides would resume talks in Cairo on 
Tuesday in a bid to resolve remaining differences, but Israeli 
officials said consultations were continuing in Jerusalem and 
the talks were not scheduled to begin. 
  The disagreements have held up the beginning of the Israeli 
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, which should have begun on 
December 13 under the Declaration of Principles signed on 
September 13. The handover should be completed by April 13.

<F P=106> ['Ali Ibrahim article: "The Arab-Israeli Gas Projects"] </F>
  [Text] There are no reservations regarding discussion of 
projects with Israel but it is important that the Arabs should 
link this to progress in the peace nogotiations. 
  The Qatari foreign minister's confirmation that his country 
is discussing with Israel the construction of a gas pipeline has 
ended the controversy which had been going on for over a month 
with press reports about the project and denials by officials, a 
familiar state of affairs considering the development of the 
region and the current direct contacts with Israel in the 
context of the peace negotiations. 
  The Qatari gas pipeline project is not the only one. Press 
reports have been talking about another Egyptian-Israeli project 
although that is a different case because Cairo has full 
diplomatic relations with Israel. 
  It is clear that the Arab official inclination, deduced from 
officials' statements and interviews with them, is to hold 
exploratory talks on joint projects with Israel provided their 
implementation is made conditional on progress in the peace 
negotiations and on prior conclusion of political agreements. 
That is the correct way because it would be improper to offer 
free prizes while the peace negotiations were stumbling. 
  As a matter of principle, there ought to be no reservations 
regarding ideas and issues of that kind, for as long as we 
accept the principle of negotiations for a comprehensive peace, 
it follows that there will in the future be full relations 
including trade, investment, tourism, and so on. 
  But there are some apprehensions which should be discussed 
frankly. Peace and normal relations would not mean harmony of 
interests nor would they mean the disappearance of 
contradictions. Peace in the general sense means that the 
parties to the conflict agree not to resort to arms in the 
settlement of their differences. Realistically, nobody even 
expects full normal relations overnight because the element of 
trust requires time and requires dealing for some time. That is 
why international strategists do not expect a flow of relations 
between the Arabs and Israel immediately after peace is 
achieved. They expect the two sides to take their time in 
exploring one another. 
  In the view of these strategists, joint projects could, if 
concluded at regional level, speed up the elimination of 
suspicion and distrust and create common interests, although 
what is required at the same time is that such process, if 
useful, should be within a framework that would give priority to 
Arab market interests. 
  Another concern is that there are some ideas that Israel 
will 
be the Arab economies' bridge to the international market. If a 
new regional economic system is going to emerge with Israel as 
part of it, the Arab side should have more say because it is the 
bigger part. 
  The Israeli economy may be bigger and much more advanced 
than 
the Arab economies but, according to international studies, the 
general Arab economy is the one with great opportunities for 
growth, expansion, and progress. With the dense Arab 
populations, if the per capita income grows, the Arab markets 
will surpass what was achieved by the Asian tigers.

  [Text] The Arab Maghreb Union summit, which was due to be 
held on 5 February [in Tunis], has been postponed to a later 
date, according to well-informed sources. This official 
postponement announced by the host country, Tunisia, does not 
cancel the Council of Ministers' meeting of the Arab Maghreb 
Union scheduled for the same day, 5 February, in the Tunisian 
capital. 
  The decision to postpone the summit, which was taken by 
Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, was at the request 
of Mauritanian President Maaouiya Ould Sid Ahmed Taya, in view 
of the current developments on the Mauritanian political scene, 
resulting from the recent municipal elections in that country. 
  This Mauritanian request is not the only reason why the 
summit was postponed, because according to the same source, King 
Hassan II [of Morocco] was going to be represented at this 
summit by an envoy. Moreover, Mr. Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi has 
also announced that he will not be attending the summit 
proceedings. Algeria, which took over the chairmanship of the 
union on 1 January 1994, had prepared the proceedings of this 
summit [as heard] and [words indistinct] supported Tunisia's 
request for a postponement.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hanan 'Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the PLO </F>
delegation to United Nations, by Umberto de Giovannangeli; place 
and date not given: "The Palestinians Are Running Out of Time" 
-- first paragraph is L'UNITA introduction] 
  [Text] "No, the hopes that the agreement between Rabin and 
'Arafat gave rise to have not vanished, but disappointment is 
increasingly spreading in the occupied territories because of 
the delay in implementing the agreement. Israel must understand 
that time is a decisive factor for a landless people." At this 
crucial stage in the Middle East peace negotiations, Hanan 
'Ashrawi's words provide an insight into what is happening in 
the Palestinian camp. 
  [Giovannangeli] What is the prevailing mood today in the 
occupied territories? 
  ['Ashrawi] Disappointment, no doubt, and a lot of 
skepticism, 
but not only about the possibility of reaching a peace agreement 
with Israel quickly. In fact, I would even say that this is a 
secondary aspect in relation to the outbreak of internal 
problems within our own camp. 
  [Giovannangeli] What sort of problems? 
  ['Ashrawi] The crucial issue is that of democracy -- how 
decisions are made which affect the Palestinian people's future. 
Many of us are aware of the risk of not being ready for autonomy 
when we get there. We must build our institutions, form a new 
ruling class, and this is a task which we cannot delegate to 
someone else or postpone until a vague "future." 
  [Giovannangeli] Is it this shortfall in democracy which lies 
at the heart of the clash within the PLO? 
  ['Ashrawi] Rather than a clash, I would speak of a difficult 
self-reform process aiming to strengthen Palestinian democratic 
structures. In other words, the question is not to remove 
'Arafat, but to reconsider his role as an unchallenged leader 
who takes upon himself all the burdens -- and the honors -- of 
decisionmaking. 
  [Giovannangeli] What does this mean exactly? 
  ['Ashrawi] This means creating a new ruling class that can 
give shape and substance to the Palestinian nation. This is the 
challenge which the PLO is now facing: To change from being a 
national liberation movement into the embryo of the future 
Palestinian state. 
  [Giovannangeli] How did 'Arafat respond to your requests for 
greater democracy? 
  ['Ashrawi] Disagreement concerns the "two-stage" policy 
advocated by 'Arafat: first achieving independence, and then 
everything else. I have voiced my dissent in this respect. If 
we do not already make use of all the energies and intellectual 
resources available to us today, we risk giving birth to an 
authoritarian state, and this is not what we have been fighting 
for over the past 50 years. 
  [Giovannangeli] However, on the road leading to a 
Palestinian 
state there is Israel, which is accusing the PLO of attempting 
to disrupt the negotiations' timing agreed in the "statement of 
principles." 
  ['Ashrawi] This stage of the negotiations reflects the 
essence of the conflict between Israel and Palestine. It is not 
"good" and "evil" which are opposing each other, but two equally 
legitimate sets of reasons, of rights. I am perfectly aware of 
the importance the security issue has for the Israelis, I know 
and understand their fears. But Rabin must understand that for 
my people, as much as for his own, symbols have great 
importance. The Israeli prime minister is right to say that 
what is at issue today is Gaza and Jericho's autonomy, but he 
cannot dismiss as being "tendentious" our request to highlight 
immediately, also in material terms, the actual link between the 
transitional stage and the negotiations' final outcome. I have 
never advocated an "everything now" position. I have always 
been convinced, and still am, that peace with Israel can only be 
achieved gradually, one stage at the time. Because of this 
position, I was threatened by "Hamas," but I am not afraid of 
being accused of treason. My fear is that autonomy may end up 
becoming a sort of self-imposed ghetto. 
  [Giovannangeli] Mrs. 'Ashrawi, let us go back for a moment 
to 
13 September 1993. What aspect of that "Declaration of 
Principles" do you regard as being the most valid four months 
later, and which, on the contrary, do you consider to be the 
most fragile? 
  ['Ashrawi] The agreement contains an element of strategic 
importance: the explicit recognition of the PLO by Israel and 
the international community as a whole and, therefore, the 
recognition of the Palestinian problem as a national question. 
The agreement's limitations concern the ambiguity of certain 
formulations included in it, particularly as regards the 
withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and Jericho, and the 
future of the Jewish settlements. The risk that I perceive 
today is that such ambiguities will be resolved only on the 
basis of the balance of forces, which is clearly to Israel's 
advantage. 
  [Giovannangeli] Are you therefore pessimistic about 
negotiations being continued? 
  ['Ashrawi] Despite everything, I still believe that the 
negotiations can be resumed, finally leading to the 
establishment of our self-government. The news from Davos is 
encouraging in this sense. I had the opportunity of meeting 
Israeli Prime Minister Peres several times, and I am convinced 
that he genuinely wishes to achieve a fair peace in the region... 
  [Giovannangeli] Is time an obstacle to peace? 
  ['Ashrawi] You see, the Israelis, like the Syrians or the 
Jordanians, can afford the luxury of procrastinating when it 
comes to looking for a peace settlement. At any rate, they have 
a state, a land to live on, a recognized national identity. We 
have nothing of all this. It was not easy -- believe me -- to 
convince the kids in the refugee camps that we must continue to 
believe in dialogue. However, we managed to do so, just as we 
managed to give back some hope to our elders by promising them 
that they would see their lifetime's dream come true: national 
independence. Today, they are asking us to justify such 
promises, they are asking us when all this will begin to happen. 
Unfortunately, we still live in the present, under Israeli 
occupation. 
  [Giovannangeli] What about your own political future, Mrs. 
'Ashrawi? 
  ['Ashrawi] I intend to strengthen the Palestine Human Rights 
Committee, which was set up less than a month ago in the 
territories. This body will closely monitor the Palestinian 
leadership's actions, ensuring that respect for human and civil 
rights does not remain a statement of principles and nothing 
more.

<F P=106> [Basim Abu-Sumayyah dispatch from the occupied territories] </F>
  [Excerpt] In the Gaza Strip, a previously unknown 
Palestinian faction, called the battalions of martyr Ahmad 
Abu-al-Rish, which is affiliated with the Fatah Movement, has 
announced its rejection of the peace negotiations. In its first 
statement, distributed in Khan Yunus and Rafah yesterday, it 
called for escalating armed struggle against Israel, saying that 
negotiations should be carried out through the muzzle of a gun 
and not across a peace table. The Abu- al-Rish faction claimed 
responsibility for eight armed operations against the Israeli 
Army in January. 
  Palestinian sources in the Gaza Strip say that the 
Abu-al-Rish battalions were formed following the assassination 
of Ahmad Abu-al-Rish, a member of the Fatah Hawks, by the 
Israeli secret units last November. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Riyad Mansur] </F>
  [Text] Amman -- In the first Palestinian opposition 
reaction to the Davos meeting between President Yasir 'Arafat 
and Israel's Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, the Popular Front 
for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], led by George Habash, 
has called on the Palestinian leadership to abandon the Oslo 
agreement and account for its actions to the Palestinian people, 
in view of the damage it has caused. 
  The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP], 
led by Nayif Hawatimah, called for the immediate resignation of 
the Palestinian leadership, which, he said, is not authorized to 
carry on with its devastating policies. 
  'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh, member of the Political Bureau of the 
PFLP, told SAWT AL-SHA'B that before the Davos meeting, it had 
been expected that the PLO negotiators would work out a 
compromise with the Israeli side. But the compromise reached 
accommodated Israel's requirements on the issues of security and 
the crossings. It is regrettable, he said, that things will 
follow much the same line in the future. He noted that the 
Palestinian negotiators reached security agreements with Jordan, 
and asked what has become of them after the Davos session. 
  Malluh urged the rejectionist Palestinian forces and Arab 
forces to move to counter the negative consequences of the Oslo 
accord to give priority to Arab-Palestinian relations and 
inter-Arab relations in order to confront what Israel is trying 
to impose on the Palestinian party or the other Arab parties. 
  Malluh urged the Palestinian leadership to immediately 
abandon the agreement ratified with Israel and to return to the 
Palestinian people, whom it harmed, to account for its actions. 
  Taysir Khalid, member of the DFLP Political Bureau, told 
SAWT 
AL-SHA'B that the results of the Davos meeting, as reported by 
the media, reiterate that the only interpretation of the Oslo 
agreement is the Israeli interpretation. Khalid added that the 
Oslo team gave the impression that there were Israeli and 
Palestinian interpretations of the Oslo agreement. He added 
that what was announced in Davos reiterates that the 
implementation of the agreement falls within the framework of 
what is drawn up by Israel. Khalid, who withdrew from the PLO 
Executive Committee protesting the Oslo agreement, described the 
presence of a Palestinian lawyer at the crossing point as a 
presence to bear false witness to Israel's right to control 
internal and external security in accordance with the military 
laws and orders of the occupation authorities.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jawid al-Ghusayn, chairman of the board of </F>
directors of the Palestine National Fund, by Marc Rozen in 
London; date not given: "The Development of the Autonomous 
Palestinian Territories"] 
  [Text] [Rozen] What role might the diaspora play in the 
peace process? 
  [Al-Ghusayn] The peace agreement between Israel and the PLO 
only concerns the Palestinians in the occupied territories and 
the Palestinian exiles who were living there in June 1967, 
during the war. Under the terms of the Treaty of Washington, 
the rest -- some 3 million people -- are not authorized to 
return, at least not for the time being. The fate of the 
Palestinians of the diaspora and those who left after 1967 will 
be the subject of the final phase of negotiations with Israel. 
I believe that many of the Palestinians living abroad will 
invest their money in the territories. But before they do this 
they are waiting for the Israelis to withdraw and for durable 
peace to be established in the region. In order to gain a 
general idea of the future of Palestine, the other problems must 
first be solved: the 1948 refugees, the issue of water, 
borders, and Jerusalem. Its future is also linked to the kind 
of relations established with neighboring countries. Economic 
cooperation and development will be a logical follow-up to peace. 
  [Rozen] Must the diaspora make donations or investments? 
  [Al-Ghusayn] The effect of donations is limited. We need 
investments. We want to set up a market economy in which the 
private sector -- rather than just the public sector -- will 
play a predominant role. We also want to limit bureaucracy in 
the new state, which could form part of a confederation along 
with Jordan. 
  [Rozen] Will the PLO go ahead with nationalizations? 
  [Al-Ghusayn] The days of socialism and nationalizations have 
definitely come to an end. Today, everyone is busy privatizing. 
We want to create a free zone in Gaza with peace, security, and 
no bureaucratic restrictions, so that investors will be inclined 
to set up shop in these territories. 
  [Rozen] How will you finance the budget of the Gaza-Jericho 
unit? 
  [Al-Ghusayn] During the two-year transitional period, our 
budget will have to be financed by the international community. 
Meanwhile, we shall have to establish an efficient system for 
collecting taxes and customs duties. We could also benefit from 
some of the taxes collected by the Israelis during the 
occupation. As you know, Palestinian resources are extremely 
limited. Our main assets are our well-trained laborers and the 
tourist potential. 
  [Rozen] What does the future hold for the local 
administration? 
  [Al-Ghusayn] The current administration of the territories 
could serve as a kind of nucleus. It will have to be 
revitalized and modernized by professionals and using 
technology. We want to build a government machine that is 
lightweight and efficient. The inhabitants of the territories 
will be responsible for the administration, not the expatriate 
executives in Tunisia. They must have priority regarding 
employment, because they are living there and are aware of the 
local problems. 
  [Rozen] Do you intend to return to the country? 
  [Al-Ghusayn] Every Palestinian is an uprooted individual who 
remains attached to his homeland. 
  [Rozen] Why do you favor the political dimension? 
  [Al-Ghusayn] The psychological environment is of key 
importance when it comes to establishing good cooperation. When 
you take on an associate in the business world, the 
understanding is based on trust, reciprocity, and equality 
between the two parties. How do you intend to build a future if 
you distrust each other? That is why we must first settle the 
political problems, the main one being the refugee issue. 
  [Rozen] Is Yasir 'Arafat motivated by economic issues? 
  [Al-Ghusayn] Being a trained engineer, Yasir 'Arafat was an 
entrepreneur in Kuwait before he became chairman of the PLO. He 
knows the significance of free enterprise and the free movement 
of capital.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Husni Mubarak by Ursula Stenzel: </F>
place and date not given -- recorded, Mubarak statements in 
English with superimposed German translation] 
  [Text] [Stenzel] Your Excellency, Egypt has played an 
eminent role in the Middle East process since the Camp David 
accord. Particularly in the past few days you and your 
government have been once more in the center of attention of 
Middle East diplomacy. What are the reasons for the optimism 
that Israel and the PLO will now achieve a breakthrough? 
  [Mubarak] First of all, I would like to point out that the 
first courageous step that opened the door to an overall 
solution was made by President Al-Sadat. Without his courageous 
step we would not have achieved a solution and not even any 
contact between the parties to the conflict to this day. As far 
as the Gaza-Jericho agreement is concerned, a problem that has 
existed for 45 years, it is not easy to implement it within a 
week, or two or three months. The two sides are facing problems, 
but I am optimistic that they will reach agreement, although the 
problems will continue. Still, these problems will be overcome, 
because there is no alternative to negotiations. That is a fact. 
  [Stenzel] The implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement 
has been delayed. Demilitarization had been put off before, now 
the two sides have agreed on 13 April. Do you think that this 
deadline can be kept? 
  [Mubarak] The negotiations will be concluded swiftly. 
Whether it is the 13th or not is not a problem. The point is 
to conclude an agreement and start implementing it. There are 
differences of opinion between the Palestinians and the 
Israelis. In the declaration of principles it was mentioned 
that security remains in the hands of the Israelis -- at least 
until a final agreement is reached. Now the Palestinians want 
to carry out all checks on Palestinians coming to Gaza or 
Jericho themselves. Yet, the Israelis say that anybody passing 
through these checks could then go anywhere in Israel. Still, I 
think that this problem will be solved. 
  [Stenzel] Mr. President, as there was no Camp David without 
Egypt, there will not be a new agreement without the Syrians. 
How close is Syria to being integrated in the peace process? 
So far, one had the impression that Syria was more or less 
hesitating. 
  [Mubarak] No, Syria is not hesitating. I had several talks 
with President Al-Asad, with the Israelis but also with all 
other countries. I think, and I hope that the negotiations that 
are currently being held in Washington will yield a result in 
the immediate future. Syria is anxious to solve the problem and 
to sign a peace treaty, also with the inclusion of Jordan. 
  [Stenzel] Will there be a summit meeting between President 
al-Asad and Prime Minister Rabin? 
  [Mubarak] I think that, initially, al-Asad will not agree to 
such a meeting. Only after they achieve something will they 
meet -- certainly sometime in the future. The point is that the 
Syrians want an agreement. 
  [Stenzel] And at what price? The return of the entire Golan 
Heights? Do you think that Israel will be prepared to agree to 
that? 
  [Mubarak] Well, I cannot speak on behalf of Israel, but I 
can say that in order to reach a settlement with Syria, Golan 
must be returned. There may be certain conditions, such as a 
demilitarized zone, some multinational troops. This will not be 
the problem. 
  [Stenzel] Mr. President, what is the use of the best peace 
agreement when fundamentalism destabilizes the entire region? 
  [Mubarak] Look, you in Europe and in the United States, who 
live far away from this area, have your own assessment of the 
situation that does not coincide with the realities of the area. 
So many people claim that Egypt has a problem with 
fundamentalism like Algeria. I do not want to talk about 
Algeria, but you must not compare Egypt with another country. 
Egypt has a 7,000-year-old civilization, Egypt has its roots 
here, Egypt is a strong country. We are in control of all these 
things. It happens, of course, sometimes that some 
fundamentalists, some extremists who were in Afghanistan while 
the Soviets were there and were trained there, and who were 
financed by other countries, are trying to destabilize the 
situation here. I think that this is very difficult. If you 
talk about fundamentalism in the entire region and the danger 
that emanates from it for the peace process, then I have to say 
that I do not believe it. The further they advance, the less 
room the fundamentalists will find for creating problems. 
  [Stenzel] Are you not under pressure of time? Is there not 
a danger that radicalism will increase the longer people have to 
wait for real peace in the Middle East and do not benefit from 
it, economically and socially? 
  [Mubarak] The danger is that one has to deal with all these 
criminals, thus neglecting the economic reform. Only then will 
the situation become more complicated. We are not doing that. 
We are pushing forward economic reform because only in that way 
can we improve the people's standard of living. Only if we were 
to freeze this economic development and concentrate exclusively 
on fundamentalism would the economic situation deteriorate, and, 
thus, encourage fundamentalism. 
  [Stenzel] There might be another danger to the peace process 
by a possible change of government in Israel. 
  [Mubarak] Mr. Rabin and the Labor Party understand the 
situation very well. Besides, we signed the peace agreement 
with Menahim Begin. Once an agreement is signed between the 
Palestinians and Israel, between Israel and Syria, I think that 
even the Likud opposition, if it were to take over power, would 
respect these agreements. 
  [Stenzel] Last but not least, what do you expect from the 
visit to Egypt by Austrian President Klestil? 
  [Mubarak] We have had excellent relations with Austria since 
the time of Bruno Kreisky. I had more than 10 meetings with him 
in Vienna, and we received him in Cairo. We have traditional 
relations with Austria. We will discuss bilateral issues with 
the Austrian president, the support of the Middle East process 
by Austria, because Austria used to play a very active role 
regarding the Palestinian problem. We expect to discuss many 
problems of the area, questions of cooperation, what could be 
done for the peace process. 
  [Stenzel] Recently, Norway instead of Austria played an 
important role as a promoter of dialogue between Israel and the 
PLO. Could you imagine Austria resuming an important role in 
this connection? 
  [Mubarak] Austria is capable of playing an eminent role. I 
wonder why the strong, active role of the Kreisky era was not 
continued. We had contacts with Austria, we will inform the 
country of the peace process, and I think Austria could play a 
very important role. 
  [Stenzel] A more active one. 
  [Mubarak] Yes, for sure.

  [Text] Cairo, Jan 29 (AFP) -- A party of senior Egyptian 
Interior Ministry officials has gone to Yemen to try to counter 
the influx of Islamic fundamentalist guerrillas from 
Afghanistan, the semi-official daily AL-AHRAM reported on 
Saturday. 
  The paper said the delegation wanted to "stop the 
fundamentalists coming from Afghanistan from reaching Cairo 
through Yemen" to carry out attacks. 
  The paper said the delegation was "carrying documents with 
the addresses of the homes of fundamentalists" implicated in 
recent attacks in Cairo. 
  The report said Islamic militants arrested in Egypt, 
including the alleged perpetrators of an abortive attempt to 
assassinate Egypt's Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi in November in 
Cairo, had supplied police with these addresses. 
  They also provided information about camps located in Yemen 
where they received training in weapons handling and explosives. 
  The visit to Sanaa follows a recent meeting in Tunis between 
the Egyptian and Yemeni interior ministers, Hasan al-Alfi and 
Muhammad Salim al-Mutawakkil. 
  Al-Mutawakkil told AL-AHRAM then that they had discussed the 
possibility of signing a an extradition treaty to enable Egypt 
to recover fundamentalists who had fled to Yemen. 
  He said Yemen had "set up lines of coordination with Egypt 
in 
the fight against terrorism."

  [Text] The Foreign Ministry handed David Sultan, the 
Israeli enemy's ambassador in Cairo, an urgent memorandum last 
week. The memorandum demanded that quick and full information 
be provided to the Egyptian authorities about the circumstances 
related to the detention of 15 Egyptians in Israeli prisons 
since approximately a year ago. The memorandum called for 
allowing Egyptian Embassy personnel in Tel Aviv to attend the 
interrogations of the detainees. 
  A Foreign Ministry source has told AL-'ARABI that seven of 
the Egyptian detainees, whom Israel has declined to name, are 
accused of spying. The eight others are alleged to have 
infiltrated into occupied Palestine without obtaining an entry 
visa. The source added: It seems that the Tel Aviv authorities 
intend to continue to hold the Egyptians in custody to bargain 
for the extradition of Israeli drug trafficker Yusuf Tahhan, who 
was sentenced to death in Egypt a few years ago, but the 
sentence has not yet been carried out.

  [Text] Cairo, 1 Feb (MENA)--AL-AHRAM has urged the Arab 
League in its upcoming meetings to define the rules concerning 
the economic boycott of Israel in order to maintain a minimum 
degree of Arab unanimity on this issue. 
  In its commentary published today, the paper refers to the 
current controversy over the question of the boycott, which came 
into the open following the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli 
agreement in September. The paper notes that the basic 
prevailing conviction is that a settlement in the region will 
have to lead to normal relations over a certain period of time, 
something that the direct parties to the conflict acknowledged 
from the start when they joined the multilateral talks for 
economic regional cooperation. 
  The paper emphasizes that there was a general conviction 
that 
certain criteria governed the lifting of the different types of 
boycotts as the settlement process progressed, but this 
conviction has been somewhat shaken recently.

<F P=106> [Article by Wajih Abu-Dhikri: "Regarding the Arab Boycott: </F>
U.S. Commerce Secretary Puts the Cart Before the Horse"] 
  [Text] In his important interview with senior writer Sa'id 
Sunbul, U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown discussed the Arab 
boycott [of Israel]. He said: We in the United States are 
against the policy of boycott in general. It is part of my 
responsibility during this tour to call for an end to this type 
of boycott, which has harmed U.S. companies. During my visit, I 
have sensed many positive signs for now, he added. The U.S. 
secretary gave several examples of Arab-Israeli cooperation. He 
noted that he had obtained a promise from Arab League Secretary 
General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid to refer the issue of ending 
the boycott to the Arab foreign ministers! 
  The U.S. secretary, as I understand from his important 
interview with Sunbul, has come to the region to terminate the 
Arab boycott of Israel. I know he may achieve some progress 
toward this "termination," but he needs to answer an important 
question: Do we end the boycott before or after a comprehensive 
peace? Lifting the boycott before peace is achieved deprives 
the Arabs of one of the important elements of pressure backing 
up the Palestinian, Syrian, and Lebanese negotiators. Thus, the 
U.S. secretary is putting the cart before the horse. 
  I know the decisions of the boycott bureau in Damascus are 
not honored by most Arab states because they are not based on 
logical foundations. I also know that some Arab states have 
turned a blind eye to the boycott of Israel and started making 
deals, albeit secretly, with it. I know that Israel's exports 
to the Arab countries are rising and that more Arab delegations 
have been visiting Israel, both openly and in secret, following 
the Gaza-Jericho Agreement. But the boycott was one of the 
weapons used by the Arab negotiators in the battle for peace. I 
appeal to the Arab League secretary general to restate the Arab 
League Council's decision that the boycott must not be lifted 
before a comprehensive peace is achieved. 
  Regarding the Middle East market, the U.S. secretary said 
that some believe this market is an "Israeli-U.S conspiracy" the 
purpose of which is to swallow Arab markets. The secretary 
added: Certainly, the long years of tension and hostility have 
created mistrust, resulting in several conspiracy theories that 
have no foundation. He added: The motives of these theories 
could be understood, but there is no conspiracy! 
  In response to the U.S. secretary's remarks, I repeat what 
Israel has stated more than once regarding its views on this 
market: 
  1. The Suez Canal could be canceled out by building a 
"competitive" canal from Elat on the Gulf of Aqabah to the 
Mediterranean. 
  2. A pipeline could be built to convey Arab oil from its 
sources in the Gulf to an Israeli port, thus harming both Egypt 
and Syria [who have similar pipelines]. 
  3. A phosphate industry in cooperation with Egypt could be 
established, undermining industry in Jordan. 
  There must be more, Mr. Secretary, that has not been 
declared! The strange thing about Israel's views on the Middle 
East market is that they seek to set up alternative industries 
to those in Arab states, which are of the utmost importance to 
these countries. For example, Israel is thinking of building an 
alternative to the Suez Canal, Sumed [Suez-Mediterranean 
Pipeline], and the Egyptian and Jordanian phosphate industries. 
Even in space, Israel fought Egypt so that it would have no 
place [in satellite transmission]. 
  So, Israeli thinking, at least on the Middle East market, is 
conspiratorial, despite what U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ronald 
Brown has stated.

by Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta. 
  Dr. Ghali had left Paris for Rome two days ago at the end of 
a conference of the advisory committee of the creditor nations 
to Egypt, which opened at the World Bank's European headquarters 
in the French capital on Monday.

  [Text] The People's Assembly members resumed their 
criticism of the government policy statement yesterday. 
  The members said the state finds itself in a dangerous 
situation because of the spreading famous trio: unemployment, 
corruption, and terrorism. 
  The members noted the very high prices of all basic 
commodities and services, demanded a fixed, standard price for 
bread, and cautioned against the continuing rise in water, 
electricity, and medicine prices. 
  They called for social justice in the government's measures 
and for protecting and securing free medicine for students and 
workers. 
  Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi leveled sharp criticism at 
some newspapers and described what they publish about the 
officials' corruption as "coffee shop and street talk."

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Cairo AL-SHA'B in Arabic on 21 January 
publishes two articles charging government officials of 
involvement in illicit dealings involving Fawzi al-Sayyid, a 
discredited construction contractor. 
  The first article, a 300-word report by Mahmud Bakri, 
appears 
on the front page. Bakri writes: "New scandals are coming to 
light with regards to the illicit dealings of Fawzi al-Sayyid, 
Madinat al-Nasir multimillionaire. Al-Sayyid's illegal 
practices were committed with the help of National Democratic 
Party [NDP] officials, police officers, and members of the 
People's Assembly and Consultative Council. Al-Sayyid has been 
involved in various activities besides construction in the 
period 1985-90. Some security officials have concealed a report 
prepared by government circles about the multimillionaire's 
activities in this regard. In return, these officials accepted 
substantial kickbacks from al-Sayyid. 
  Bakri adds that al-Sayyid transferred a large part of his 
financial assets abroad after "his relations with an official in 
the Presidential Office deteriorated." The reason for the 
strained relations was that the said official, whom Bakri 
declines to name, wanted al-Sayyid to foot most of the bill for 
land that the official bought in Ismailia and the Red Sea area. 
  The second article, an 800-word report by 'Imad Mahjub, 
appears on the front and seventh pages. 
  Mahjub begins by reviewing the career of the Presidential 
Office's secretary Zakariya 'Azmi and stating that "questions" 
remain about 'Azmi's dealings, despite the "smokescreen" he 
hoped to raise by filing a complaint against AL-SHA'B with the 
Public Prosecution Office. 'Azmi, Mahjub claims, owns a 
10-million pound [$3 million] mansion, despite his humble 
beginnings as a junior employee in Cairo's municipal service. 
The mansion was built "by a certain contractor who has won 
other government contracts, including the mansions of ministers 
and senior government officials." 'Azmi also acquired various 
types of properties in the names of his family members and only 
won in the People's Assembly elections because of heavy support 
by the government apparatus. 
  Mahjub then relates the story of a piece of land that ended 
up in the hands of Madinat al-Nasr multimillionaire al-Sayyid, 
after being owned before by a Greek immigrant and then a drug 
dealer. Mahjub claims that "a very senior official" helped 
al-Sayyid assume possession of the 6-million pound piece of land. 
  Mahjub then claims that the government intends to stop 
investigations into al-Sayyid's and similar fraud cases "in 
order to save the necks of senior officials who are clearly 
involved in these cases." Mahjub then describes al-Sayyid's 
comfortable confinement in a prison hospital and predicts that 
he will be "released on bail in a few days, after which the 
storm will blow over and the case will be declared closed for 
good."

  [Text] Cairo, 28 Jan (MENA)--Interior Minister Major 
General Hasan al-Alfi has declared that terrorism does not 
target Egypt alone but all Arab and Islamic countries. 
  In an interview with the newspaper AKHBAR AL-YAWM published 
in Saturday's issue, al-Alfi said that terrorist acts in Egypt 
are similar in the way the perpetrators are armed, the way bombs 
are manufactured, and the way acts of sabotage and 
assassinations are planned. [sentence as received] He added 
that he saw things abroad that prove this. He explained that 
this shows that terrorist schemes are not limited to Egypt but 
are designed to harm all Arab countries. 
  The interior minister said that Egypt knows the identities 
of 
the countries that finance the terrorists but does not want to 
reveal them so that the terrorists who are there now will not 
escape. 
  Maj. Gen. al-Alfi stressed that the police are taking the 
initiative rather than reacting to operations and are aborting 
them before they can occur. He said the police have succeeded 
fully in this task and that a new attempt to assassinate certain 
public figures was uncovered and the criminal culprits were 
arrested and referred to the Prosecutor's Office. He explained 
that no public announcements will be made on this issue until 
the trial begins. 
  The police recently thwarted plans to sabotage vital 
installations and assassinate public figures during the 
Christmas holidays and the Police Day celebrations. The 
individuals involved were arrested. 
  The interior minister said the police have been equipped 
with 
modern equipment and that they depend on scientific planning, 
sophisticated technology, and modern weapons.

  [Text] Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi has stated that a 
study is under way to set up special funds to provide life 
insurance for police officers. He emphasized that the ministry 
provides medical and social care to all policemen and to the 
families of martyred policemen. He noted in this regard that 
two hospitals had been built in Asyut and Tanta to offer 
services to policemen in the Delta and Upper Egypt regions. 
  Al-Alfi pointed out that the current security strategy seeks 
to modernize the police department by supplying it with modern 
equipment, weapons, and technology, step up security patrols, 
and lift the morale of policemen. 
  The minister denied that the Palestinian organization Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement] is involved in terrorism in Egypt. 
He noted that Palestinian defendant Samir Isma'il Salih joined 
the terrorists in his personal capacity and that he is not 
connected with Hamas. 
  Al-Alfi stressed that efforts are being made to extradite 
the 
remaining terrorists abroad, adding that so far 23 terrorists 
have been repatriated following intensive contacts with the 
countries they were in.

  [Text] The security organs in al-Jizah, in coordination 
with the state Security Intelligence Service, launched a 
large-scale security campaign at 0500 yesterday. The campaign, 
which lasted until 0900, targeted the areas of Ka'abish, 
al-Thalath Tawabiq, 'Izbat 'Fakihah, Kafr al-Mansi, al-Jabal, 
Bulaq, and the pyramids. The security forces captured 148 
suspects, including seven extremist terrorist elements, and 
seized a quantity of automatic and semi- automatic weapons. All 
the defendants were referred to the prosecution for 
interrogation. 
  Major General Fahim Husayn, assistant interior minister for 
al-Jizah security, ordered the al-Jizah security forces to raid 
the terrorists' lairs in coordination with the state Security 
Intelligence Service. Secret information received confirmed the 
terrorists' intention to carry out operations targeting the 
police, especially during the Police Day celebrations. The 
security forces launched their raids at 0500 yesterday in the 
areas of Ka'abish and al-Thalath Taqwabiq. They arrested 88 
suspects, including the seven extremist terrorists. 
  A responsible security source said that one of these seven 
terrorists was involved in the recent incidents in Imbabah, 
Bulaq, al-Dakrur, and al-Ma'sarah. The source added that the 
interrogation of the group confirmed their membership in a new 
organization that planned to attack policemen, especially on 
Police Day. 
  The AL-AHRAM AL-MASA'I correspondent learned that the raids 
were carried out by more than 80 officers and about 300 soldiers 
equipped with modern weapons and armored vehicles and supported 
by a number of fire engines in anticipation of any clashes with 
the extremist elements. 
  The raids were carried out without any resistance from the 
targeted elements and not a single bullet was fired. 
  At the same time, another group raided the areas of Kafr 
Tuhurmis and the villages of 'Abd-al-'Al and al-Mashabik. Some 
46 suspects were arrested and the prosecution began their 
interrogation. 
  A security source said that the interrogation of the 
terrorist group is being held in total secrecy and the release 
of their names will be delayed.

  [Text] In exclusive remarks to AL-'ARABI, Mufti of the 
Republic Dr. Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi has called for allowing 
political Islamic groups to participate in the upcoming national 
dialogue. He added: The government's dialogue with political 
parties and youth of various tendencies as well as with any 
group or individual, regardless of their inclination, is a good 
thing. It is required for each side to listen to the views of 
the others in the interest of the country, presuming that the 
intentions are sincere. 
  Asked how the youth branded as "extremists" could be 
represented in the national dialogue, the mufti said: The 
important thing is to start the dialogue. As for the question 
of how, this could be judged by the competent experts who will 
send the invitation. 
  It is worth noting that the mufti took part in a seminar 
held 
at Cairo University on Wednesday. He stressed that all 
religions oppose injustice, whether it is done by the ruler or 
the ruled, noting that corruption cases are widespread in 
society.

  [Text] AL-WAFD published on its first page Sunday [as 
published--the picture was in the Saturday 22 January edition] a 
disgraceful picture of German model Claudia Schiffer. Eight 
full days passed and only in Indonesia were the Muslims' 
feelings aroused. They forwarded a strongly worded protest to 
the German Government, while the Islamic institutions in Egypt 
maintained complete silence. 
  Finally, the Religious Affairs Committee of the People's 
Assembly made a move and released a statement urging the boycott 
of the House of Chanel. The statement was issued after the 
house apologized to the Muslims and pledged to destroy the dress 
that was embroidered with Koranic verses and the dress's 
pictures and films. 
  The Religious Affairs Committee discovered the tragedy after 
AL-WAFD published the story and the picture twice with sharp 
comment, appealing to those responsible for Islamic affairs in 
Egypt to move and confront the West's badness and depravity. 
  The unconsciousness of the officials in Egypt could be 
tolerated in every other respect, but not in what causes harm to 
Islam and the holy Koran. We cannot but ask the People's 
Assembly: Where have you been all these past days? We also say 
to all religious bodies and organizations, at the top of which 
are al-Azhar's ulema: Wake up.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by Wolfgang </F>
Kaden, Stefan Simons, and Olaf Ihlau; place and date not given: 
"We Are at a Crossroads"] 
  [Text] [SPIEGEL] Four months after the historic 
Washington Declaration of Principles, the Arab-Israeli peace 
process has now reached a decisive stage: Will a breakthrough 
be achieved now or will there be a setback that will call 
everything into question once again? 
  [Rabin] My goal is to end the 100-year conflict between Jews 
and Palestinians. The first great step forward was achieved in 
Washington last September... 
  [SPIEGEL] ...but nothing has happened with respect to the 
basic treaty that was to come into force on 13 December. Why 
have you allowed yourself to end up in such a tight spot? 
  [Rabin] The fact that we could not meet that deadline -- 
three months after the signing -- in no way means that there has 
been a setback. Whoever levels accusations at us about that is 
not aware of the pitfalls that were hidden in the agreement. 
The Israeli-Palestinian negotiations that are under way in 
Taba, Oslo, Paris, and Cairo are no longer about principles, but 
about details. 
  [SPIEGEL] So, the details are the problem now. 
  [Rabin] It is particularly awkward to negotiate something 
with the Palestinians. We want a new reality, peaceful 
coexistence between two peoples between whom -- for goodness' 
sake -- there is no love, but profound distrust. On top of 
everything, the two peoples are closely intermingled. That is 
why it is exceptionally difficult to implement the basic 
agreement. There are a great many issues that have to be 
clarified: security, infrastructure, jobs, and the supply of 
water and electricity. 
  [SPIEGEL] And how long should the clarification process 
last? 
  [Rabin] In my opinion, we need another two or three months 
really to settle all the details. That is the only way in which 
we can achieve our goal. However, I am sure that we will 
achieve it. 
  [SPIEGEL] Many Palestinians feel that you are deliberately 
playing for time. 
  [Rabin] Nothing works without patience. Ultimately, we are 
trying to end a conflict that has gone on for 100 years. 
Germany and France did not become friends overnight. 
  [SPIEGEL] So why did you promise to start the withdrawal of 
Israeli troops from Gaza and Jericho on 13 December? By setting 
a schedule did you not put yourself under pressure? 
  [Rabin] That was undoubtedly a mistake, one that we both 
made, and I told that to 'Arafat at our third meeting on 12 
December. We should have met much earlier and discussed 
everything. 'Arafat suddenly chose to interpret the treaty in a 
way that was entirely different from that of his team, and he 
did so with respect to all the basic points, such as our 
responsibility for border security. 'Arafat suddenly changed his 
position by 180 degrees. We could have avoided such 
misunderstandings. 
  [SPIEGEL] When you shook hands with the PLO chief at the 
White House, your aversion to doing so was clearly visible. 
  [Rabin] My feelings have got nothing to with it. I had made 
the basic decision of holding negotiations with the PLO. 
  [SPIEGEL] President Clinton had to give you considerable 
help when it came to shaking hands. 
  [Rabin] We were together with the president for one moment 
before the ceremony. At first we did not say anything to each 
other, then I said to 'Arafat: It will be difficult to 
implement this treaty. 'Arafat replied: Yes, it will be very 
difficult. 
  [SPIEGEL] You have met 'Arafat several times since then: Do 
you trust him today? 
  [Rabin] I would be wary of saying anything publicly about 
'Arafat's character in the middle of negotiations. As far as I 
am concerned the choice was either we speak to the PLO or we 
have to tackle the Islamic extremists in the Hamas Movement. If 
Israel wants peace with its neighbors, then it has to deal with 
enemies, often mortal enemies. 'Arafat and I are aware of the 
responsibility that we have assumed. Ultimately, the results 
that we achieve will show what the risk that we have taken was 
worth. 
  [SPIEGEL] You have not gotten much to show for it so far. 
Every delay weakens 'Arafat's position and his ability to make 
concessions. That cannot be very convenient for you? 
  [Rabin] It is true that we are behind schedule. However, in 
the meantime, the Palestinian opponents of the treaty have 
intensified their terror campaign against Israel. It comes as 
no surprise that our enthusiasm for the treaty has begun to wane. 
  [SPIEGEL] That is equally true of the Palestinians, who 
suspect that Israel is playing some kind of dishonest game. 
  [Rabin] Excuse me for having to point something out to you: 
There is no democracy in the Arab countries, at least not in the 
sense in which there is democracy in Israel and the Western 
countries. We have to deal with authoritarian or totalitarian 
regimes. 
  [SPIEGEL] That is precisely that accusation that the 
opposition is leveling against you, that you want to conclude an 
agreement with politicians of that sort. 
  [Rabin] I do not expect 'Arafat to have his Palestinians 
under control before he has set up a strong security apparatus 
of his own in the Gaza. 
  [SPIEGEL] Why do you not want to make a humanitarian gesture 
and release the 12,000 Palestinians that are incarcerated in 
Israeli prisons? 
  [Rabin] I do not believe that the release of the 
approximately 9,000 prisoners would be a contribution to overall 
security. Israeli support for the peace treaty is declining, 
because of the rising number of terrorist attacks. 
  [SPIEGEL] As you have said, there is 100 years of hatred 
and confrontation between Israelis and Palestinians. Does the 
population of Israel really desire a reconciliation? 
  [Rabin] Everyone is talking about peace, but everyone 
interprets peace differently. One thing is clear: There will 
only be peace if all the parties concerned are prepared to make 
painful compromises. Whoever believes that conflict with the 
Palestinians can be ended without granting them autonomy will 
not achieve peace. 
  [SPIEGEL] Autonomy is not enough for the Palestinians. It 
is the first step toward their own state. Can you imagine such 
a state existing alongside Israel? 
  [Rabin] In the longer term, I can imagine a confederation 
composed of the sovereign states of Israel and Jordan and within 
that, a Palestinian entity with its own administration, but not 
an independent Palestinian state. 
  [SPIEGEL] What status would Jerusalem -- a capital city for 
both Israelis and Palestinians -- have then? 
  [Rabin] Jerusalem is the capital city of the Jewish state. 
It cannot be divided. 
  [SPIEGEL] It must above all be difficult for the 130,000 
Israeli settlers in the occupied territories to give up the goal 
of a greater Israel, which includes the biblical lands in 
western Jordan and the Gaza Strip. 
  [Rabin] I personally do not believe in a greater Israel that 
would include the occupied territories. That would mean that we 
would not only annex western Jordan and the Gaza Strip, but by 
including those territories, we would also forcibly place 1.8 
million Palestinians under our authority, people who are 
different from us in terms of politics, religion, and culture. 
Israel would thus become a bi-national state and not the 
realization of the 2,000-year-old Jewish dream of a return to 
Zion. 
  [SPIEGEL] Does that mean a return to 1967 borders? 
  [Rabin] I am opposed to that. We have a right to insist on 
changes to borders, especially with regard to security. That 
would entail a limited inclusion of other territories, but with 
as few Palestinians as possible. 
  [SPIEGEL] What would happen to the 144 settlements in the 
occupied territories then? 
  [Rabin] We have to distinguish between the settlements that 
are important for Israel's security and those settlements that 
-- contrary to our will -- were created by the Likud Party for 
political reasons. I do not believe that the latter are a 
contribution to the security of our country. 
  [SPIEGEL] They could become a danger. Radical settlers have 
announced that they will offer militant resistance vis-a-vis the 
Palestinians. 
  [Rabin] I would ask you not to draw conclusions too hastily. 
We will deal with the question when it arises. During the 
transitional period of the treaty, the settlements will remain 
where they are. 
  [SPIEGEL] You were a professional soldier and a hero of the 
1967 Six-Day War. What has actually turned you into a dove? 
  [Rabin] I did not become a soldier out of a sense of 
vocation, but because of circumstance. I went to agricultural 
college and actually wanted to become a hydraulic engineer. 
Then World War II broke out. I was unable to study and joined 
the Israeli underground army, the Palmach. I was a soldier for 
27 years.... 
  [SPIEGEL] .... and made it to the post of chief of the 
general staff. 
  [Rabin] Fortunately, I was head of the general staff during 
the most successful war that Israel has waged, the Six-Day War. 
During my entire time in the military, I was aware that we need 
to be militarily strong to safeguard our security. At the same 
time, it was also clear to me that our military power must be 
translated into political terms. The Arab-Israeli conflict 
should no longer be settled on the battlefield. One should not 
just leave wars to the generals, but the search for peace should 
also not just be left to politicians. 
  [SPIEGEL] So, do you want to appear in the history books as 
the person who achieved peace? 
  [Rabin] Believe me, I am not concerned about titles, fame, 
and office. I have been almost everything that one can be in 
our country: head of the general staff, ambassador in 
Washington, defense minister, and prime minister -- I am not 
concerned about this position that I am occupying now. What I 
am concerned about is achieving security and peace for Israel. 
The current regional and international layout of forces 
provides a unique opportunity. 
  [SPIEGEL] Being an old military man, your critics accuse you 
of being committed to the peace process not with your heart, but 
with your head. 
  [Rabin] For Israel, peace always means that we have to pay, 
usually with territorial concessions. What did we receive in 
return? Words, treaties. It is worth noting that such 
agreements are not with democratic states, but with 
authoritarian regimes. That is why I have to constantly ask 
myself: What about our security? With the wars that it waged, 
Israel took great risks, and now we must also risk a great deal 
for peace. 
  [SPIEGEL] Are you now counting on peace and 
reconciliation, because you believe that Israel's strategic 
superiority in the Middle East is being gradually reduced? 
  [Rabin] Not at all. We have time, but that is not the point 
at issue. We are living in a new age. The Cold War is over, 
and the Soviet Union has disappeared as a source of disruption 
in the Middle East. The United States, which acted resolutely 
in the Gulf war, has acted resolutely. That has led some Arab 
leaders to think things over. Who knows whether Syria's 
President Asad would have opted for the path of peace if he had 
still had Moscow's military and economic support. 
  [SPIEGEL] That almost makes it sound as if Israel now lives 
in a world without real enemies. 
  [Rabin] In the longer term, there are, of course, dangers: 
the growing strength of Islamic extremists in almost all Arab 
countries and the lunatic ambitions of the regime in Iran that 
is behind these movements. Apart from that, Iran and Iraq are 
seeking to become nuclear powers by the year 2000. 
  [SPIEGEL] Why do you trust President al-Asad today? The 
Syrian leader is an ally of Iran and still fundamentalists and 
terrorists. 
  [Rabin] Previously, al-Asad sought to keep up with Israel 
militarily. He can no longer hope to do that today. Of course, 
there always is the danger of a return to the past, and there is 
speculation that a new Damascus-Tehran-Baghdad axis will be 
formed. I do not think that that will happen. Only one thing is 
certain: This year we are standing at a crossroads. The year 
1994 will tell us whether the Middle East will be move toward 
peace or will be stuck in a stalemate situation. 
  [SPIEGEL] And stalemate would mean war when the next move is 
played? 
  [Rabin] Perhaps not next year, but possibly in five or seven 
years' time. 
  [SPIEGEL] That is why the Americans are trying to draw the 
Syrians into the peace process. Do you feel that you have to 
some extent been placed under pressure by U.S. President Clinton? 
  [Rabin] It is clear that the Americans want Israel to be at 
peace with all its Arab neighbors. Washington does not have to 
tell me that the key partners in that respect are the Syrians 
and the Palestinians. The Palestinians do not constitute a 
danger to Israel's existence, but the Syrians do. If we manage 
to settle matters with them, to achieve a genuine peace -- as we 
did with Egypt -- then we will have created a security zone 
around us, a buffer against potential enemies in a war such as 
Iran or Iraq. 
  [SPIEGEL] So, are you ready to return the Golan Heights, 
which were captured from Syria in 1967, to achieve peace? 
  [Rabin] It would not be particularly wise to set out the 
course of our current negotiations with Syria at this stage. I 
will not say in public that I am ready to pay the highest price. 
Both sides are trying to achieve as much as possible for 
themselves. 
  [SPIEGEL] Do you really believe that Asad will be satisfied 
with less than Egypt's President Sadat was? He got back the 
entire Sinai Peninsula from Israel. 
  [Rabin] That is a nice question, but I cannot answer it. 
New circumstances exist, and those justify a different course 
of action on the part of Israel. 
  [SPIEGEL] Even a partial return of the Golan Heights would 
mean that Israeli settlements would have been abandoned. 
  [Rabin] I would like to say once again that in the current 
complex situation, you cannot expect me to give a clear-cut 
answer. Our talks with the Syrians have just started up once 
again. We are seeking to conduct them as discreetly as 
possible, in the same way that we pursued talks with the 
Egyptians at one time. 
  [SPIEGEL] The Camp David peace agreements mean that in 1990 
Israeli settlers had to leave the Sinai, which was returned to 
Egypt. 
  [Rabin] I know. 
  [SPIEGEL] Are you afraid that opponents of the treaty -- 
fanatical Palestinians or Israeli extremists -- will 
nevertheless try to torpedo the peace process with terrorist 
attacks? 
  [Rabin] That could already happen today, while we are still 
in charge, or it might not happen until tomorrow, once Jericho 
and the Gaza Strip are under PLO control. Then it will 
transpire whether Arafat's security forces can ensure law and 
order and whether they can prevent the Gaza Strip from becoming 
a shelter for terrorists. To my mind, that is the decisive test 
of whether Palestinians are really willing to accept peaceful 
coexistence and whether they are capable of that. 
  [SPIEGEL] Prime minister, thank you for talking to us.

  [Text] In a letter sent to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, 
settlers in the Jordan Valley write that if reports are true 
that Israel agreed to set up three territorial corridors -- 
which will dissect the Jordan Rift Valley -- this constitutes a 
declaration of war on settlement in the Jordan Valley. Our 
settlement affairs correspondent Gil Litman reports that the 
settlers go on to tell the prime minister: Do not force 
settlers who merely want to farm to turn into warriors fighting 
for their homes and lives. The settlers say they will not put 
up with such lethal blows and will not allow the establishment 
of a Palestinian corridor anywhere in the Jordan Valley.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Avner Regev: "Lebanon First"] </F>
  [Excerpts] The disparity between the headlines heralding 
progress in the political process and the information about the 
situation in the territories delivered in various forums 
presents us with a serious dilemma. If, as reported by the 
media, the Palestinians are prepared to assume control, and the 
delay is the result of minor disagreements, how do we explain 
the pronouncement of army officers involved in the territories 
population's everyday life that the confusion there is so great 
that practical discussions on the transfer of rule cannot be 
launched? [passage omitted] 
  Even now the Palestinians are trying to secure external 
manifestations of political independence. For them, the interim 
arrangement is close to an independent state. For them, the 
permanent arrangements go beyond the achievements of the interim 
arrangement, and they will deal mainly with the borders of the 
state-to-be, the status of Jerusalem, and the refugees' right of 
return. Thus the prime minister, who understands the dilemma 
and has reservations about the Palestinian stands -- and is 
occasionally prepared to accept certain demands while never 
forgetting the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] officers' assessments 
-- has a problem on his hands. He can slow down the process 
with the Palestinians until the situation on the ground permits 
the transfer of control to be made. He can make a unilateral 
move, such as withdrawing from Gaza, or he can make a 180-degree 
turnabout, launching serious negotiations with Syria, Lebanon, 
and Jordan with the objective of reaching full peace. 
  One of the ideas discussed recently in political corridors 
speaks of a special gesture toward Syria in Lebanon. The exit 
from certain Lebanese areas and the reduction of the security 
zone's size in the first stage may display goodwill that will 
help the Syrians to evince more flexibility at the negotiating 
table. In addition, a unilateral gesture in Lebanon will be 
welcomed by the Americans, who, while favoring the negotiations 
with the Palestinians, have repeatedly shown their 
dissatisfaction with the Oslo accord. The U.S. Administration 
takes a positive view of negotiations with bona fide countries, 
even dictatorial ones, and a less than positive view of talks 
with organizations which have no established territorial basis, 
organizations whose aspirations for independence may not even 
have the support of other countries in the region. 
  An accelerated process with Syria stands a chance of 
culminating in a positive outcome that will impact the region no 
less, and perhaps more, than a fragile interim agreement with 
the Palestinians. An accord with Syria will result in an 
arrangement in Lebanon and peace with Jordan, isolating the 
Palestinian problem. 
  The al-Asad-Clinton summit has created a certain momentum 
and 
the prospects of progress are good. A move with the Syrians 
that includes significant territorial withdrawal will enjoy the 
support of Likud figures -- unlike the emerging agreement with 
the Palestinians. Rabin called on al-Asad to make another 
courageous move, to meet him halfway. If al-Asad has indeed 
come to the conclusion that peace is a strategic goal, he can be 
trusted to make a move that will convince the prime minister of 
the seriousness of his intentions. 
  In parallel, Israel can make a unilateral move in south 
Lebanon, one that will not impair its security while helping to 
ease the tension between the two countries. This category 
includes King Husayn's declaration in Washington concerning his 
willingness to openly meet with Rabin. An overt meeting would 
be a natural sequel to the clandestine meetings held over the 
years, and one may safely assume that this time it will 
culminate in understandings that will lead to a signed agreement 
with Jordan. We can presume that Husayn made his Washington 
declaration after coordinating positions with Damascus, and it 
should be seen as a clue to al-Asad's desire to reach full peace 
on all fronts, including Jordan and Lebanon. 
  When he entered office about 18 months ago, Rabin waited for 
some signal from al-Asad -- secret or overt -- that would supply 
him with a good reason to move faster in the political process. 
For a long period, al-Asad took his time, and that brought 
about the Oslo agreement. Perhaps the opening Rabin has been 
expecting for months has just been breached, and it will now be 
possible to move on to a new era on the northern border, one in 
which no security threats will loom over Israel any longer. 
Lebanon First may be a possible and a desirable solution.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report from New York by Hayim Handwerker] </F>
  [Excerpts] Israeli economic sources have expressed fear 
that the United States is trying to surreptitiously alter the 
spirit of the free trade agreement between the two countries by 
changing the regulations pertaining to the country of origin. 
[passage omitted] 
  According to the agreement between the United States and 
Israel, any change in the free trade agreement requires prior 
consultations and agreement. U.S. sources promised Israeli 
representatives that Israel had no reason to be concerned. 
Officials in Jerusalem nevertheless fear that certain Israeli 
industries may be seriously affected by these changes. Israel 
has still not studied the changes in the rule of origin 
provisions; however, it seems that the Israeli textile industry, 
for example, could be badly hurt by the anticipated tightening 
of the rules. 
  Finance Minister Avraham Shohat and Industry and Trade 
Minister Mikha Harish have sent letters to Treasury Secretary 
Lloyd Bentsen and U.S. Trade Commissioner Kantor expressing 
concern about the recently proposed changes in the rules of 
origin, designed to maintain harmonious trade relations between 
the United States and the NAFTA countries and ease the load on 
U.S. customs. As a result of these changes, Israeli companies 
may be asked to pay customs on products previously exempt under 
the free trade agreement. 
  The U.S. officials have not yet replied. The matter was also 
raised in the talks between Shohat and U.S. Trade Secretary Ron 
Brown in mid-January. [passage omitted] 
  Officials in Jerusalem are worried because the proposal 
calls for comprehensive regulations stipulating, among other 
things, that whenever there is a discrepancy between various 
rules of origin and the NAFTA regulations, the latter will 
prevail. NAFTA regulations on rules of origin are tougher than 
those in the trade agreement with Israel. Officials in 
Jerusalem fear that one day they will find themselves facing 
faits accomplis.

<F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin] </F>
  [Excerpts] Senior IDF [Israel Defense Forces] officers, 
including General Staff major generals, two days ago leveled 
criticism at the Finance Ministry's decision to allocate only 
250 million shekels for the IDF withdrawal from the Gaza Strip 
and Jericho and its redeployment. 
  On 28 January, a discussion was held at the bureau of 
Yitzhaq 
Rabin, prime minister and defense minister, with all the 
officials dealing with the autonomy issue. The discussion was 
attended by Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq, the chief of staff; 
Maj. Gen. Uri Sagi, head of the Intelligence Branch; Maj. Gen. 
Shalom Hagay, head of the Logistics Branch; the commanders of 
the Southern and Central Commands; Israel Police officials; the 
head of the Shin Bet; and others. The discussion mainly dealt 
with the implications of the IDF redeployment, the autonomy, and 
the evacuation of Gaza and Jericho. 
  At the discussion, it became apparent that the Finance 
Ministry will give the IDF only 250 million shekels for the 
evacuation and another 100 million for the protection of the 
Jewish settlements, in addition to the IDF's annual budget. 
  According to a senior IDF source, the agreement was made 
between the Finance Ministry and the defense establishment, 
without the IDF's knowledge, and, according the agreement, the 
defense establishment will not ask for additional funds. 
[passage omitted] 
  It has been learned that the IDF claims that the overall 
budget required for the evacuation of the IDF from the Gaza 
Strip and Jericho and its subsequent redeployment is over 550 
million shekels. [passage omitted] 
  It has further been learned that the IDF will insist on 
receiving additional funds for the redeployment beyond the 250 
million shekels allocated. 
  The prime minister said that he understands the situation 
and 
that he will try to handle the matter. 
  Speaking at a meeting over the weekend -- held at Bet 
Hahayal 
in Tel Aviv, and attended by Prime Minister Rabin, Chief of 
Staff Baraq, and all the IDF reserves officers ranking from 
brigadier general up to former chiefs of staff -- Gen. Uri Sagi, 
head of the Intelligence Branch, said that an all-out war with 
the Arab countries is not expected in 1994, and that he expects 
the political process to continue. 
  Gen. Sagi also referred to the remarks made last week by 
Maj. 
Gen. 'Uzi Dayan, according to which a limited war is to be 
expected if the talks collapse. Sagi said that there are two 
evaluations. Dayan represented the Planning Branch's stand (an 
operational evaluation) and, according to the Intelligence 
Branch estimate, no war is expected in 1994. 
  This was the first time the IDF presented the senior 
reserves 
officers with its plans, debates, and political evaluation.

  [Text] With a majority of Labor ministers against the 
Meretz ministers and Minister Hayim Ramon, the government today 
decided to withdraw the original national health insurance bill 
from the Knesset and return it for deliberations in the Knesset 
House Committee. At the request of Minister Amnon Rubinstein 
the government did not deal today with the two clauses that 
pertain to the Histadrut Labor Federation and the collection of 
taxes, but will do so in its next session. 
  Health Minister Hayim Ramon told our correspondent Hayim 
Hecht that in view of the government's decision he is determined 
to resign and will submit his letter of resignation at the 
opening of the cabinet session next Sunday. Minister Ramon said 
that in his private meeting with the prime minister prior to the 
cabinet session he informed Rabin of his plans, and in his 
opinion there is no personal rift between Yitzhaq Rabin and 
himself. 
  Our correspondent notes that during the cabinet session 
sharp 
words were exchanged between some of the ministers and Ramon. 
Minister Tzur accused Ramon of being a spoiled boy. Ramon said 
in return that the ministers who went back on their support for 
the bill caused severe damage to the Labor Party. 
  In today's cabinet session, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
expressed great appreciation for Ramon's performance as health 
minister. He said the bill's amended version is not an 
expression of ideology, rather a necessary compromise between 
what is desirable and what is attainable. He emphasized, at the 
same time, that the bill retains its two most important 
principles: it covers all the citizens of Israel, and payment 
will be determined on the basis of salaries.

  [Text] The Labor Party convention approved by a large 
majority the ministers' compromise proposal on the national 
health reform bill after a tense debate in which Health Minister 
Ramon did not announce his resignation. The voting was 
conducted by a show of hands after convention chairman Minister 
David Liba'i called for a preliminary vote to halt the debate in 
order to conduct the final vote. 
  The convention was opened by Prime Minister Rabin, who 
explained the significance of the amendments required in the 
bill. The ministers' compromise proposal calls for returning 
the original bill to the government for amendments, after which 
it is to be submitted to the Knesset. 
  In his speech, Minister Hayim Ramon harshly criticized the 
compromise proposal for the national health reform bill, but 
contrary to expectations, he did not announce his resignation. 
In his speech Ramon reviewed the history of the bill and 
accused the party apparatus and officials of emptying the 
original bill of its content. Our correspondents Sheli 
Yehimovich and Shmu'el Tal note that Minister Ramon's speech was 
constantly disrupted until at times he could hardly speak. 
Ramon called on the convention to reject the compromise 
proposal. 
  Prime Minister Rabin reacted to Minister Ramon's criticism. 
He was followed by Labor Secretary General Nisim Zvili. The 
debate ended with the vote, which approved the compromise 
proposal of the ministers against the wishes of Minister Ramon. 
  In a news conference held after the convention, Minister 
Ramon said he will submit his resignation when the amended bill 
is submitted to the Knesset.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] The newspaper AL-THAWRAH comments on the Middle East 
peace talks, noting that Syria has always taken the lead in 
efforts to promote peace in the region. It has done its utmost 
to nurture the peace process and ensure the implementation of 
the relevant international legitimacy resolutions in a manner 
that would guarantee the restoration of all Arab territories and 
rights to their rightful owners. 
  The paper adds: The ball is now in the Israeli court. For 
the future of the peace process, as well as the future of 
security and stability in the region hinge upon the moves the 
Rabin government might make. Hence, this government must 
declare its clear and open commitment to the bases and terms of 
reference enshrined in international legitimacy resolutions to 
help achieve a true and durable peace. 
  AL-THAWRAH goes on to say: But, if Israel resorts to its old 
well-known tactics, then the international community must 
shoulder its responsibilities and perform its role of curbing 
Israeli belligerence and removing all the difficulties 
obstructing the peace talks. This is essential if this 
community really wants this region to enjoy security and peace. 
  The newspaper TISHRIN affirms Syria's commitment to the 
requirements of achieving just and comprehensive peace, arguing 
that partial settlements and separate deals will neither achieve 
peace, nor ensure security, as the course of events has shown, 
particularly in the aftermath of the signing of the Gaza-Jericho 
accord. As a matter of fact, they have only exacerbated the 
regional situation and derailed the peace process, the paper 
notes. 
  TISHRIN adds: Syria has explained its positions, which 
advocate the attainment of just and comprehensive peace, with 
all clarity during the Geneva summit. Consequently, it has 
affirmed that the party that is promoting comprehensive peace is 
the very party that is eager to see the region enjoy stability, 
the party that is committed to the components of comprehensive 
peace. As for the U.S. peace initiative, which is grounded in 
the principle of trading land for peace; the relevant UN 
Security Council resolutions; and the concept of comprehensive, 
just, durable, and true peace, they should not be looked at as 
useless instruments. As a matter of fact, these instruments 
reflect concrete positions that should shape the peace to be 
achieved. Syria has underscored all this when it upheld the 
concept of full withdrawal in return for full peace, and spelled 
out its objectives, as explained in the document it submitted to 
the Israeli negotiators during the sixth round of the Washington 
bilateral talks. This document has continued until this moment 
to constitute a true and objective basis for just and 
comprehensive peace. 
  Concluding its commentary, TISHRIN says: Syria, which is 
eager to achieve peace and working to attain it, has reiterated 
that just and comprehensive peace is its strategic option. 
Hence, it has become extremely necessary and important for the 
peace process to achieve its objectives. It has become 
extremely necessary for it to make positive and constructive 
progress, which is contingent, first and foremost, upon Israeli 
acceptance of complete withdrawal from the occupied Arab 
territories, Israeli commitment to the implementation of the 
relevant international legitimacy resolutions, and Israeli 
subscription to the principle of trading land for peace.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] The Israeli prime minister has admitted that peace 
with Syria is very important and that the Syrian track is the 
most important track. This runs counter to what he said just a 
few months ago in the wake of the signing of the Oslo agreement 
amidst all the media clamor. 
  Despite the fact that the Israeli prime minister has always 
sought to hit one track with another and fabricate 
contradictions among the Arab parties involved in the peace 
process, and despite the fact that he managed to take on the 
Palestinian party separately, all of the subsequent developments 
and the stumbling of the Oslo agreement brought to the forefront 
the facts of the established, just solution in the Middle East. 
Israel had to acknowledge Syria's central role in the peace 
process. The Geneva summit came to consecrate this role and to 
confirm the bases and facts of the desired peace in the region. 
  Thus, when Rabin acknowledges the importance of peace with 
Syria, he is in fact acquiescing to the facts of the conflict. 
Rabin's statements should have reflected decisively on the 
talks currently being held in Washington on the level of heads 
of delegations. Despite the relatively practical atmosphere in 
these talks, the Israeli negotiating team has not yet given a 
satisfactory answer on Israel's complete withdrawal from the 
Golan Heights -- a withdrawal which Syria expects in return for 
peace in the region. Rabin returned to his tune on holding a 
plebiscite for the Israelis on withdrawal from the Golan Heights 
and on what he termed peace with Syria after reaching a draft 
Syrian-Israeli agreement. Rabin thinks he is authorized to sign 
agreements on the other tracks, but not the Syrian one, and 
justifies this by saying the Golan Height are strategically 
important and that the Israelis are suspicious of the Syrians. 
  The fact is that the Israeli prime minister is contradicting 
himself. He uses a plebiscite as an excuse for extortion 
against Syria and to deflect it away from the demand of the just 
and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. Peace is the most 
important guarantee for security and there is no area of special 
strategic importance for any region in the world in the age of 
missiles and aircraft. Syria, as the world acknowledges, has 
always been faithful to what it says. President al-Asad 
expressed Syria's firm, principled stand in his well known 
statement "we fight in honor, and we make peace in honor." 
Geographic expansion did not, and will not, guarantee security 
for Israel. That expansion will only be a tool to ignite wars 
in the region in the future. Syria has offered a just and 
comprehensive peace, a peace with no occupation, one that will 
lead to stable conditions in the Middle East in return for 
regaining the occupied territories. 
  If peace with Syria is a basic element, as Israel's leaders 
acknowledge, and the key to peace in the Middle East, then peace 
is now at hand. It only requires a positive Israeli response to 
the UN Security Council resolutions and the principles of 
international law by ending its occupation of the Arab 
territories, recognizing the rights of the Palestinians, and 
getting involved in the crucible of the just and comprehensive 
peace. 
  We do not believe that any two people in the world will 
dispute the fact that returning the entire Golan Heights is a 
basic condition for peace with Syria. Throughout the long years 
of the Arab-Israeli conflict, Syria has never relinquished, and 
will never relinquish, an inch of land or a single right. Nor 
will it ever yield to the Israeli extortion. 
  Thus, Rabin is playing the plebiscite game in the wrong 
place. The Golan Heights have been Syrian territory since time 
immemorial. This fact cannot be changed by a thousand Israeli 
plebiscites. Syria in the past ignored the [Israeli] annexation 
of the Golan Heights. Equally, Syria will not give any weight 
to these threats. The Israeli prime minister should instead 
instruct his negotiating team in Washington to address the 
substantial issues and approve the return of the entire Golan 
Heights to Syria because this is a basic condition for any 
progress in the talks. When Syria sets the condition of 
returning all the occupied territories in return for peace, it 
is showing respect, in letter and spirit, to the UN Security 
Council resolutions, the principles of international law, and 
the UN Charter. The Israeli occupation, which continues to 
date, is a flagrant infringement on these resolutions, 
principles, and charter and constitutes a defiance of the entire 
world community. Israel's submission to international law will 
mark the beginning of the road to the established of a lasting 
peace in the Middle East that will benefit every state in the 
region.

  [Excerpt] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali 
received in his office at the Prime Ministry today a delegation 
from the Lebanese Foreign Ministry, led by the ministry's 
secretary general, Zafir al-Hasan. 
  The delegation conveyed condolences from Lebanon--president, 
government, and people--on the martyrdom of late Na'ib 
al-Ma'ayitah, the counselor at the Jordanian Embassy in Lebanon, 
and Lebanon's condemnation of this ugly crime in which one of 
Jordan's sons was killed. 
  He emphasized that Lebanon is pursuing the perpetrators of 
the crime so that they will receive the toughest punishment, and 
said that Lebanon is ready to cooperate with Jordan in this 
field. 
  The meeting was attended by Dr. Fawwaz Abu-al-Ghanam, acting 
minister of state for foreign affairs, the Jordanian Foreign 
Ministry secretary general, and the Lebanese ambassador to 
Jordan. 
  Dr. Abu-al-Ghanam received the Lebanese Foreign Ministry 
delegation, led by Zafir al-Hasan, in his office at the Foreign 
Ministry this morning. 
  Al-Hasan conveyed the condolences of the Lebanese Government 
and people to His Majesty King Husayn, and the government and 
people of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, and to the martyr's 
family. He expressed the Lebanese Government's strong 
condemnation of this cowardly criminal action. 
  He stressed that the Lebanese Government will do all it can 
to arrest the perpetrators, and that it considers this incident 
a threat to Lebanon's security, stability, and safety. 
  Dr. Abu-al-Ghanam emphasized the importance of joint efforts 
in order to identify the criminals, saying this will be in the 
interest of sisterly Lebanon and will also deter crime. 
  He thanked the Lebanese Government for its condolences and 
sincere feelings toward the Jordanian people and the family of 
the deceased. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 31 Jan (MENA)--Ziyad Abu-Ziyad, head of 
the Palestinian delegation to the multilateral talks' working 
group on arms control and regional security affairs, has 
rejected the Russian-U.S. paper on arms control in the Middle 
East. In a statement to MENA, he said the paper, which contains 
many details, is an indirect attempt to give new interpretations 
to UN Security Council Resolution 242 on which the Arab-Israeli 
peace talks are based. 
  Abu-Ziyad explained that in the morning session, the 
Palestinian delegation proposed forming a minicommittee to draft 
a new paper or amend the Russian-U.S. paper. The proposal was 
accepted. 
  Abu-Ziyad said the Palestinians object to the Russian-U.S. 
paper because it tries to interpret the clauses of UN Resolution 
242. The paper thus discusses the inadmissibility of the 
seizure of land by force without discussing Palestinian 
territory. It speaks about the region's states but ignores the 
region's peoples. This means that the paper ignores the 
Palestinian people and their rights. He said this approach is 
rejected because the Palestinian people are now passing through 
a stage of liberation and the establishment of a Palestinian 
state. This must be considered. He explained that any attempt 
to rearrange relations among the region's states must consider 
that another state, namely the Palestinian state, is about to be 
established. So, the Palestinian people's rights and interests 
must be taken into account. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Kuwait City, Jan 30 (AFP) -- OPEC may decide to 
reduce oil production to prop up falling crude prices, at its 
next ministerial meeting scheduled for March 25, Kuwaiti Oil 
Minister 'Ali al-Baghli said in remarks published Sunday [30 
January]. 
  The minister, quoted by the Kuwaiti daily Al-Anba', said a 
cut in output "would be agreed on if OPEC was sure it would lead 
to a bolstering of crude prices." 
  In December the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council -- 
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and 
Bahrain -- said it was ready to lower production to stabilise 
prices if other producers worldwide pledged to do the same. 
  Omani Oil Minister Sa'id Bin-Ahmad al-Shanfari recently 
toured producers outside the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries to seek their support for the GCC [Gulf Cooperation 
Council] offer, but his initiative has not affected the oil 
markets. 
  OPEC members fear a resumption of oil exports by Iraq, 
suspended under the embargo imposed on Baghdad after its 
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, may push oil prices to new 
lows. 
  Last month they fell to their lowest level in five years, 
deepening a trend that began in the second half of 1993 due to 
excess supply, recession in industrial states and the spectre of 
Iraq's return to the oil market. 
  "OPEC will hold an extraordinary meeting immediately the 
embargo on Iraqi oil is lifted," al-Baghli said. 
  Iraq hopes the oil embargo will be lifted this year, 
following its acceptance in November of long-term weapons 
monitoring -- one of the Gulf war ceasefire conditions laid down 
by the United Nations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Information Minister Muhammad Salman by </F>
AL-MUSAWWAR journalist Sana' al-Sa'id; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Al-Sa'id] What is your view on Israel's recent 
proposal about a possible referendum before any withdrawal from 
the Golan, and on Rabin's stance on not making any territorial 
concessions in the Golan before consulting with the Israeli 
people? 
  [Salman] Israel has no right to hold a referendum on the 
Golan because it is Syrian territory. A referendum in such a 
case contravenes international law and the UN Charter regarding 
other countries' territories. There can be no referendum on the 
territories of other countries. The Golan was occupied by force 
and the Security Council passed Resolution 242 rejecting the 
occupation of others' land by force. There is an explicit 
provision to this effect. In addition, when Israel made a 
decision to annex the Golan and apply Israeli laws there, the 
United Nations swiftly rejected this and emphasized that the 
Golan was Syrian territory, that it must be returned to Syria, 
and that Israel must withdraw from it. Therefore, proposing the 
idea of holding a referendum on returning or refusing to return 
the Golan is like holding a referendum on whether the 
international law itself is correct or incorrect. Thus, holding 
a referendum totally contradicts international law and 
legitimacy. A referendum is invalid and absolutely 
inadmissible; otherwise, it would set a precedent that would 
prevent the existence of the United Nations. It might set an 
example for other countries of the world to reject Security 
Council resolutions and international law, making a referendum 
the judge on the legitimacy or illegitimacy of any resolution. 
  [Al-Sa'id] In the wake of the Geneva summit, Israeli Prime 
Minister Rabin said that President Clinton and not President 
al-Asad spoke about normalization of relations. Rabin stressed 
that President al-Asad did not explain what his concept of peace 
was. 
  [Salman] Israel, as we know, wants to blackmail any stance 
and wants to take before giving. Israel has not yet given 
anything. When Israel withdraws from the Golan, it is 
withdrawing from Syrian territory that will be returned to 
Syria. Israel is not giving anything, but the establishment of 
relations between countries is voluntary and subject to the will 
of this or that country and, consequently, to mutual confidence 
between countries. If there is no mutual confidence between 
individuals there can be no friendship. This definitely applies 
in international relations. President al-Asad on the Geneva 
forum and within the hearing of the whole world left no room for 
doubt that Syria and its leader declare that he is ready to sign 
a document of a comprehensive and fair peace in the region. 
This was so decisive a response to all those who attended this 
conference that President Clinton applauded it. Israel, 
however, has grown used to skirting issues and wants to foil and 
subvert the positive results of any meeting that binds it to 
withdraw from Arab territory. 
  [Al Sa'id] What are your views regarding security 
arrangements, which primarily concern Israel since fears about 
govern its motives and moves in the region? 
  [Salman] It is impossible for anyone to discuss conclusions 
before preludes nor to debate details before setting forth 
general principles. The basic issue in the peace process is 
Israeli withdrawal from the Arab territories, but the security 
issue is one of the main clauses outlined in the Syrian document 
that was submitted in the sixth round of peace talks. President 
al-Asad reiterated this issue at the Geneva summit when he 
stressed the right of all countries of the region to live in 
peace. Regarding Israel's apprehensions about security, I 
maintain that Syria's and every Arab country's security is 
threatened by Israel. The outstanding threat to the Arab 
countries is by far more real than the threat to Israel's 
security. 
  [Al-Sa'id] The Geneva summit was successful, but Israel's 
reaction to it was lukewarm. It even voiced reservations about 
Syria's intentions. My question is: What is your opinion about 
the talks that are about to take place now? 
  [Salman] Quick reactions are always the loudest. By reacting 
to the results with such coldness, Israel gave the impression 
that it does not intend to work to make peace in this region, 
because it believes that peace does not serve its expansionist 
designs in the region. Thus, it believes that peace may put an 
end to the expansionist designs it had been dreaming of. 
Everybody knows that the founders of Israel always reiterated 
that Israel's borders extended from the Nile to the Euphrates. 
By accepting a just and comprehensive peace in the region, 
everyone will know the geographical boundaries he can live in. 
That is why Israel viewed these resolutions as halting its 
aggressive designs toward its neighbors. All these matters boil 
down to one thing; that is, that Israel must withdraw first. 
Before withdrawal, there can be no talk about any future idea 
or step. Thus, the details and moving to discuss these details 
entirely depends on the beginnings, which constitute the main 
principle; that is, the withdrawal. So it is absolutely 
inconceivable for us to talk about the nature of security or 
talks or how we will have to coexist in the future. 
  [Al-Sa'id] But did President al-Asad obtain guarantees from 
the United States at the Geneva summit confirming that Israel 
will withdraw from all the Golan? 
  [Salman] The initiative that United States has offered 
within 
the framework of the Madrid Conference and the rounds of talks 
that followed it is based on international legality, as 
represented by Resolutions 242 and 338, meaning full withdrawal. 
So when the negotiations are guaranteed by and based on 
international legality, as represented by Resolutions 242 and 
338, this means that the United States is offering a guarantee 
that it will work according to these resolutions to achieve 
peace in this region. The United States is a permanent member 
of the Security Council and it has recognized these two 
resolutions. So by honoring the Security Council resolutions, 
it respects its participation in making these resolutions. 
  [Al-Sa'id] But Syria has no objection to security 
arrangements under which multinational forces, including U.S. 
troops, could be deployed, and through which some parts of the 
Golan could be disarmed? 
  [Salman] Syria will agree to any formula endorsed by the 
international institutions. The Security Council may authorize 
the United States to send U.S. troops as a guarantee to the 
region. If this happens, Syria will certainly respect this 
international will. Thus, all we want is to establish real peace 
and security in the region and not imagined security that could 
be violated at any time by Israel when it has the chance to do 
so. 
  [Al-Sa'id] It is said that Syria's support for the 10 
Damascus-based Palestinian groups is one of the reasons behind 
accusing Syria of backing terrorism. 
  [Salman] We differentiate between national struggle and 
terrorism. These groups constitute a resistance force to 
liberate the territory occupied by Israel. Similarly, Hizballah 
is a Lebanese party fighting to liberate its territory. How can 
these groups be called terrorists? It is Israel that is killing 
people daily. A proof of this is the number of Palestinian dead 
and detained in the occupied territories despite the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement. As a matter of fact, the number of dead 
Palestinians and detainees has doubled since the agreement was 
signed. Israel has filled its jails with Palestinians who are 
struggling to liberate their land occupied by Israel. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Can the United States fulfill its promise of 
establishing a comprehensive peace, particularly since Israel is 
trying to put forward numerous pretexts to avoid withdrawal? 
  [Salman] This is what the United States has affirmed and is 
affirming every day and at every meeting between us and the 
United States. Through the Geneva summit and the U.S. 
delegations' visits to Syria and Syrian delegations's visits to 
the United States, we have considerable confidence because the 
U.S. Administration is serious about resolving this issue and 
establishing a fair and comprehensive peace in the region. 
Peace will serve the interests of all countries of the region 
and it represents a real interest for the United States in the 
region. Instead of having soldiers stationed in the region as 
foreign forces, the United States can do without this presence 
when the region is stable and secure. It can thus deal with the 
region as a friend instead of being viewed as a force 
interfering in the domestic affairs of the region. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Do you fear the possibility of Israel's resorting 
to holding early elections and of the Likud, which is more 
extremist than the Labor Party, taking power? 
  [Salman] We are confident that the Israeli rulers dream 
about 
peace in their own special way, a peace of hegemony and 
domination. If this does not materialize, they will not accept 
the establishment of peace in this region. Circumventing issues 
is a major characteristic of Israel's behavior. Thus we do not 
think that the Israeli side will agree to establish peace in 
this region. We expect that they will circumvent the Geneva 
summit resolutions in one way or another. Perhaps they will 
create a problem by dissolving the government or calling for new 
elections or a referendum. All signs indicate that they want to 
circumvent the outcome of the Geneva summit. The propaganda 
campaign against Syria, President al-Asad, and President Clinton 
in particular was one of Israel's attempts, backed by its 
massive media organs and the Zionist lobby, to prevent the 
convening of the Geneva summit and to pressure and intimidate 
Clinton about it. 
  [Al-Sa'id] What is your current view of the situation 
regarding the Gaza-Jericho agreement? 
  [Salman] I praised this agreement from the outset, but what 
President al-Asad said about this agreement proved to be true: 
Every paragraph in this agreement needs an agreement and every 
agreement in it requires negotiations. The issue is in a 
vicious circle. Israel evades and will continue to evade. 
Israel will not give because it has grown used to taking. We 
know the destiny of this agreement. It was born feeble and it 
is now in the intensive care unit. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Was there a sort of bargain over Lebanon in the 
Geneva summit--something like pulling the Syrian forces out of 
that country or disarming Hizballah in return for Israel's 
withdrawal from the Golan? Israel claims that organizations 
such as Hizballah threaten its security. 
  [Salman] There is a Security Council resolution relevant to 
Lebanon, namely, Resolution 425. It calls for an immediate 
Israeli withdrawal. Before the Israeli occupation of Lebanon, 
no organizations like Hizballah had borne arms. Thus, these 
organizations are struggling and offering sacrifices to liberate 
the south. If their raison d'etre is removed, there will 
certainly be no need for any fedayeen operations. Those 
organizations will find no need to carry weapons if the land is 
liberated. Now they are fighting to liberate their lands. When 
an Israeli is killed, he is killed in occupied Lebanese 
territory. Hizballah does not infiltrate deep into Israeli 
territory; it is fighting Israel on Lebanese territory. But 
through the terms it uses--terms like the security belt, which 
all of us are now repeating--Israel has managed to delude the 
world into thinking that it is living in fear, and that it is 
the victim that needed the belt to protect itself. But this 
belt is in occupied Lebanese territory and an integral part of 
Lebanon--south Lebanon. It is not a security belt, as Israel 
claims; it is Lebanese territory, and its inhabitants are 
carrying arms and struggling to liberate the land occupied by 
Israel. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Although President Clinton spoke about the need 
for qualitative relations with Syria, the world was surprised at 
the U.S. State Department announcement after the summit that 
Syria will not be struck off the list of states sponsoring 
terrorism. 
  [Salman] We are not totally taken aback by this; this is not 
surprising. Had the United States--and I mean the U.S. 
Administration in particular--been convinced that Syria was a 
terrorist country, the Geneva summit would not have taken place, 
and the exchange of visits by Syrian and U.S. delegations world 
not have continued. Many U.S. Congress and Administration 
officials come to meet the president. Syria was unfairly 
accused of terrorism thanks to the influence of the Zionist 
lobby in the United States. Had it not been for the influence 
of the Israeli and Zionist lobby in the United States, which put 
pressure on the U.S. Congress and Administration, the 
[terrorism] decision would not have been made. As regards daily 
interaction, the United States and Syria do not deal with each 
other on the basis that Syria is a terrorist country. It is 
enough to say that to date, neither Israel, nor the Zionist 
lobby in the world, nor anyone in the U.S. Administration itself 
could provide a single piece of evidence that Syria carried out 
or was involved in any terrorist act, either at a state or at an 
individual level.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "How Far the Punishment"] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali took the 
right step in going straight to the U.N. Security Council 
Committee monitoring the application of sanctions against Iraq 
in a bid to highlight the Jordanian case at the United Nations 
headquarters. Jordanian losses due to the observance of the 
sanctions imposed on Baghdad in the aftermath of the Gulf crisis 
of 1991 have been carefully documented and conservatively put at 
$300 million annually. Numerous attempts have been made by 
Jordan to explain the extent of the hardships that our economy 
has sustained as a result of the application of these measures 
and to seek adequate compensation for them. It is no secret 
that industrial production in the country has been oriented with 
the Iraqi market in mind, in view of the geographic proximity 
and in order to maintain a trade balance commensurate with 
Jordan's dependence on the import of oil from Iraq. 
  All nations of the world which admit to having a stake in 
the 
stability and development of the Kingdom, whether for the 
promotion of the peace prospects in the Middle East or for the 
overall security of the region, have now an opportunity to 
translate this faith into action. This they could do by lifting 
the secondary "sanctions" that have been applied against Jordan 
and by ending their indiscriminate interference with sea 
shipping to and from al-'Aqabah. Jordanian imports and exports 
have been unduly and unnecessarily jeopardised because of 
routine inspection of freighters bound to the Jordanian Red Sea 
port. Costs to the economy attributable to such unacceptable 
practices have been staggering. Needless to say, this country 
can ill afford the additional costs to its imports and exports. 
Sea lines to Jordan have also been curtailed considerably, by 
up to 30 per cent, because ship owners cannot afford the unusual 
delays experienced by their ships en route to Jordan. The 
alternative Jordanian proposal to replace sea searches by 
on-land inspection by a neutral party is a lesser evil, even 
though such idea had been anathema to us until the recent past. 
In principle, the proposal is a threat to Jordan's sovereignty 
but it would work out as a temporary alternative. 
  As to the prime minister's other major concern--that 
Jordanian applications numbering already in the thousands, 
requesting U.N. authorisation to export certain food and medical 
products be processed on criteria basis rather than on the 
existing case-by-case method--is also a step in the right 
direction. There is no sense in spending precious time on the 
applications and working on the 15 members of the committee to 
discuss each and every request if the majority of requests fall 
under similar general category. The current method is simply 
not cost effective. A more rational way to deal with this issue 
could be found in the Jordanian proposal. Still, the central 
problem lies in neither dimension of the application of 
sanctions against Iraq. It is the question of the sanctions 
themselves that has to be reasked, especially after it was 
proven beyond a shadow of doubt that it is the Iraqi people who 
suffer most from them. Besides, Baghdad has enforced most if 
not all of the U.N. Security Council's resolutions imposed on it 
after the Gulf war. There is a good case to at least relax the 
sanctions and start lifting them on a gradual basis, 
commensurate with the extent of Iraqi adherence to the original 
U.N. resolutions.

<F P=106> [Khayrallah Khayrallah article: "Syria Was the Primary </F>
Target"] 
  [Text] Arab sensitivities should have receded, at least a 
little, now that the peace process in the region has entered a 
decisive phase that would not tolerate any mutual campaigns. To 
make hasty accusations against one Arab party or another after 
the assassination of the Jordanian diplomat in Beirut is to 
ignore the risks involved at this particular juncture. One 
cannot but understand the Jordanian position maintaining that 
the aim of the assassination of the diplomat was to strike at 
any bid for rapprochement between Amman and Damascus. Is any 
Arab party opposed to such rapprochement? The realistic answer 
is no. 
  Actually, it should be stressed that the incident which 
occurred in Beirut, the first of its kind in three years, was a 
severe blow to Lebanon and all of its government's attempts to 
prove to Arabs and foreigners that security prevails in Beirut 
and that they can return there. In terms of the aim it was 
meant to achieve, the incident is only comparable to the blowing 
up of the Phalangist headquarters on New Year's Eve. That was 
meant to be a clear message to whom it may concern that Beirut 
would not return to normal, that all the attempts to rebuild it 
would fail, and that it would remain hostage particularly to 
those who are thought to have allocated millions for its 
destruction and for making it what it is, a den of blackmail, as 
it was in the eighties. It is clear, however, that just as the 
Phalangist headquarters explosion did not stop the 
reconstruction process, there is nothing to indicate that the 
assassination of the Jordanian diplomat, serious as it is, will 
stop the government's march. 
  Even more important, the assassination appears to be aimed 
primarily at Syria which has, in recent weeks, taken a number of 
important steps culminating in the summit meeting between 
Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton in Geneva on 16 
January. At that summit President al-Asad emphasized that peace 
is Syria's "strategic choice," and the United States confirmed 
its willingness to improve relations with Syria, which would 
pave the way for the elimination of its name from the list of 
states sponsoring terrorism. There can be no doubt that Syria's 
conduct in Lebanon will be one of the matters to be taken into 
consideration in the assessment of bilateral relations in 
accordance with a certain mechanism agreed by the foreign 
ministries of the two countries. That being the case, is it 
conceivable that the aim of the assassination was anything but 
to embarrass Syria and portray it as incapable of holding all 
the cards in the Lebanese game, and to show that the Lebanese 
question should also be discussed with other non-Syrian parties 
and outside the framework of the Lebanese Government? 
  It seems, therefore, that in the coming few days Syria will 
have to confirm that it has made its choice and that its 
decision is final. Helping the Lebanese Government identify the 
party which perpetrated that ugly crime would be the best 
confirmation of this, because Syria would not tolerate those who 
pursue a strategy different from its own, those whose strategy 
is in harmony with Israeli interests, especially the Israeli 
interest in keeping Beirut out of bounds for Arabs and 
foreigners.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Amr Nasif in Cairo] </F>
  [Excerpt] An Arab political source in Cairo, who has asked 
to remain anonymous, has told AL-SAFIR that Saudi Arabia and 
Kuwait have recruited a large number of UN inspectors in Iraq to 
work for their intelligence services. 
  The source said they have attracted key figures of the UN 
Special Commission supervising the removal of Iraq's mass 
destruction weapons. 
  The source emphasized that UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali has asked his top aides to conduct a secret inquiry 
into alleged cooperation between UN experts and "Gulf security 
agencies" and whether the experts have really informed those 
agencies of the correct details of their inspections and of the 
nature of Iraq's military and armament programs. 
  Early this month, the source said, Saudi Arabia paid 
"checks" 
worth $71 million to the UN Special Commission under the pretext 
of covering the expenses of the UN inspection teams in Iraq. 
  The source added that Saudi Arabia will offer another $50 
million for the same purpose. 
  The source said that Saudi Arabia exploited the 
international 
organization's bad finances and its failure to provide the 
necessary cash to cover the wages and expenses of inspectors to 
realize its political objectives in a way that makes the experts 
feel indebted to Saudi Arabia. This is in addition to personal 
bribes. 
  The source said that Saudi Arabia and Kuwait recruited 
several experts to work on their behalf. The experts, the 
source added, are reporting to Saudi and Kuwaiti intelligence on 
their mission. 
  The source added: The recruitment was made in coordination 
with the CIA's regional station in the Gulf. This station 
enjoys high-level relations with Saudi and Kuwaiti intelligence 
through Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN Special Commission, who is 
also a CIA officer. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Baghdad, Jan 31 (INA)--Another chapter of U.S.-led 
conspiracy has opened with the allegations that German and Saudi 
inspectors have found two containers loaded with hundreds of 
tons of chemicals on board a freighter at Jeddah Port in Saudi 
Arabia. The inspectors claim that the freighter was heading to 
Beirut where the chemicals were to be unloaded and transported 
to Iraq which will use the stuff in making missiles, says THE 
BAGHDAD OBSERVER editorial. 
  The news spread as quickly as possible and the Western as 
well as the American media flexed their muscles in manipulating 
the allegations to serve their masters' interests. The 
above-mentioned media quoted a German official as saying that 
German intelligence has obtained the information of the 
freighter from their Saudi counterpart. 
  Those who have fabricated this story are themselves the same 
enemy of Iraq. They themselves were behind the imposition of 
sanctions against the Iraqis and they themselves were parties to 
the U.S.-led aggression which destroyed Iraq's infrastructure 
and killed thousands of innocent Iraqi people. Hence what they 
claim comes as no surprise to the Iraqis who are well-aware of 
the tactics of their enemy, the editorial added. 
  When Iraq announced that it was ready to abide by all UN 
resolutions these dubious circles began to launch campaigns with 
the aim of putting a spoke in the wheel of Iraq [words 
indistinct] states to even recommend the lifting of the more 
than three years sanctions against a nation of 18 million people. 
  The daily maintained that the human rights issues was on top 
of U.S. agenda of conspiracy against Iraq. The U.S. and its 
allies Britain and France in particular released their 
accusation against Iraq and said that Iraq was abusing human 
rights in the south of the country and denying the people in the 
north food rations. What these circles alleged is definitely 
false because those people, the Iraqis, who live in the south of 
the country are suffering from the same sanctions imposed on 
Iraq by the UN under U.S. pressures. As to the people of the 
north, the Iraqi government sends them their food ration 
regularly. But the outlawed elements there, supported by the 
U.S. and its allies, steal the food ration of their people and 
sell it in the black market. 
  Today the U.S. and its allies have created another way to 
distort Iraq's reputation before the international community 
which is calling for an end to the blockade imposed on the 
Iraqis. Furthermore, the Saudi regime for its part has been 
showering money upon their puppets in the Western and American 
media to publicize such a lie, the motive of which is well-known 
for the Iraqis. The Saudi regime only wants to keep the embargo 
on Iraq to serve the interests of its allies. 
  Nevertheless it has become crystal clear that the U.S. and 
their agents including the Saudi puppets can never succeed in 
either undermining the morale of the Iraqis, nor can they 
deceive the world public opinion because the truth will soon 
come up and those who fabricated the allegations will be exposed 
by their own people, THE BAGHDAD OBSERVER concluded.

  [Text] Tyrant Saddam's regime recently liquidated another 
group of detainees in al-Radwaniyah Prison near Baghdad. 
  Our sources said Saddam's regime handed the body of martyr 
'Ammar al-Maliki and the bodies of 20 other mujahidin to their 
families in Baghdad. On 15 January, the regime also handed over 
the bodies of 50 martyrs in al-Basrah, including the bodies of 
Husayn al-'Ibadi and Musa al-Hanafi. 
  Al-Radwaniyah Prison southwest of Baghdad is currently the 
largest detention center in Iraq and run by tyrant Saddam's 
in-law Saddam Kamil. The prison, called the murder prison, was 
originally built as a military camp and was used during the 
Iraq-Iran war as a camp for Iranian prisoners. After the March 
1991 uprising, it was converted to a large detention center. 
The prison is currently occupied by thousands of 
(?inmates)--those the regime suspects of taking part in the 
uprising--especially people from the center and the south.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 1, IRNA -- Few bullets were shot during 
the ten-day dawn ceremonies held at the shrine of the founder of 
the Islamic Republic the late Imam Khomeyni Tuesday [1 February] 
morning. The shots were heard from the western corner of the 
shrine while President Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani was delivering a 
speech. 
  The ceremonies, attended by tens of thousands of 
participants, including foreign guests, were held at the 
beginning of the ten-day dawn ceremonies, marking the arrival to 
the country of the late Imam Khomeyni after a 15-year exile in 
1979. 
  An unidentified person, standing 150 meters away from the 
western gate of the shrine, shot a few bullets into the air and 
was later seized by the crowd and handed over to the Law 
Enforcement Forces. Major Reza Mohammad-Doust, a law 
enforcement officer, told IRNA that interrogation started 
immediately after the arrest and in the body search that ensued 
a number of forged student, police and press cards were found on 
the assailant. 
  The incident took place on the first day of the ten-day dawn 
ceremonies, marking the 15th anniversary of the 1979 victory of 
the Islamic revolution. 
  The shots did not disturb the ceremonies and the large crowd 
of people, after chanting "death to munafiq" (munafiq, means 
"hypocrite" a reference to the members of the Iraqi-sponsored 
terrorist Mojahedeen Khalq outfit) and "Hashemi, Hashemi you are 
the apple of our eyes", calmed down and continued listening to 
the rest of President Rafsanjani's speech.

<F P=106> [By Laurent Maillard] </F>
  [Text] Tehran, Jan 30 (AFP) -- Fifteen years after Iran's 
Islamic revolution, businessmen drive brand-new Mercedes, 
advertising billboards abound, and newspapers publish stock 
quotations. 
  And workers demonstrate against rising prices as well as 
unemployment, corruption spreads, and hardliners denounce the 
abandonment of revolutionary ideals. 
  When the Islamic revolution triumphed on February 1, 1979 in 
the name of the have-nots, it made austerity a virtue and 
nationalized entire sectors of the economy. 
  A decade and a half later, Iran has reversed course and 
headed toward a market economy, a process which has plunged the 
government into an unprecedented crisis and hit the poor 
severely. 
  The liberalization drive was launched by President 'Ali 
Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani, just one year after the revolution's 
charismatic leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeyni, died in 1989. 
  Hoping to revive an economy disrupted first by the 
revolution 
and then by the 1980-1988 war with Iraq, Hashemi-Rafsanjani 
steadily removed subsidies, started monetary reform, and backed 
privatization of industry and services. 
  He allowed foreign products back into Iran and urged wealthy 
Iranians who had fled abroad during the revolution to return 
home. 
  Liberalization filled stores with goods, plunged the country 
into a spending spree after a decade of scarcity, and brought 
new life into the Tehran Bazaar, the economy's traditional 
driving force. 
  It also led to new fortunes for those who invested in real 
estate. 
  Tehran's relationship with Washington is a symbol of its 
current pragmatism. 
  While the leadership and the press continue to label 
Washington as the "Great Satan" and the revolution's foremost 
enemy, the United States in the past few years has become one of 
Iran's main trading partners. 
  But this "second revolution" is going through increasingly 
hard times as the government fails to control it properly and 
some politicians and religious figures slow it down for fear of 
its social consequences. 
  The return to a market economy and a sharp depreciation of 
the rial have produced runaway inflation and impoverished much 
of the population who can no longer afford many items especially 
as subsidies have been withdrawn. 
  Corruption, which had disappeared in the first few years 
after the revolution, has returned at an alarming pace. 
  Uncontrolled imports combined with falling oil revenues have 
placed Iran on the brink of bankruptcy. 
  According to western sources, Iran for the first time in its 
history is unable to reimburse its debts, and has accumulated 13 
billion dollars in arrears in 18 months. The figure amounts to 
one year of oil revenue. 
  The austerity policy Iran has adopted to overcome the 
financial crisis has led to a steep fall in imports over the 
past year but at the same time sparked a crisis for industry 
which depends heavily on imported equipment. 
  Many factories are currently working at half or quarter 
capacity. For the first time since the revolution, tens of 
thousands of workers have been laid off, which has aggravated 
social tension. 
  The current crisis, the most serious since the revolution, 
has sparked sometimes brisk debate between free-market 
supporters and an increasing number who back a return to 
revolutionary basics and a centralized economy. 
  As the debate continues, many Iranian and foreign economic 
observers do not rule out that the government -- divided and 
unable to assume the political price of its reforms -- might 
turn inward again.

<F P=106> [By Hamdan al-Hajj] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Dr. Marwan al-Mu'ashshir, official spokesman 
for the Jordanian delegation to the Jordanian-Israeli peace 
talks, has affirmed that the current peace talks in Washington 
are focusing on the mechanism for the next stage of negotiations 
and the modes of action that will be followed by the 
subcommittees emanating from the bilateral talks. 
  In a telephone conversation with AL-DUSTUR, Dr. 
al-Mu'ashshir 
explained that U.S. President Bill Clinton had promised His 
Majesty King Husayn to seriously study the possibility of 
reducing Jordan's debts to the United States and that this issue 
would be followed up through various key channels. 
  Dr. al-Mu'ashshir said that this is one way to indirectly 
help Jordan, especially since the U.S. foreign aid is being 
reconsidered and even reduced, and this would therefore be the 
best way to help Jordan. 
  He added that the U.S. Administration has welcomed the idea 
of replacing sea searches by an international on-land inspection 
of the goods bound for Jordan through the Gulf of Aqaba. He 
noted that sea searches increase freight charges and reduce 
cargo sizes because of the need to leave space inside ships to 
carry out inspections. 
  Dr. al-Mu'ashshir explained that UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali has shown clear interest in the proposals made by 
Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-al-Salam al-Majali when they met last 
week. Those proposals call for easing Jordan's burdens resulting 
from the blockade imposed on the Port of al-'Aqabah, 
facilitating the processing of Jordan's [import] applications 
and treating them like those of other countries harmed by the 
blockade imposed on Iraq, and reducing the excessive 
bureaucratic measures imposed on Jordan. 
  He said that the response of the British Lloyds Company to 
the proposal for on-land inspections rather than sea searches 
has encouraged the U.S. Administration to accept such a 
compromise in order to ease Jordan's burdens resulting from the 
blockade on the Port of al-'Aqabah. He said this response has 
left a good and satisfactory impression among Americans. 
  Dr. al-Mu'ashshir stressed Jordan's concern for unanimous 
Arab decisions, especially over the lifting of the Arab boycott 
of Israel. He said the boycott issue depends on the Arab 
League, which has the final say in this regard. He said, 
however, that the secondary and third degree boycott can be 
studied and ways can be worked out to deal with this matter.

  [Text] Amman (PETRA)--The Foreign Ministry is exerting 
intensified efforts with several Arab, Islamic and foreign 
countries as well as the Arab League and the U.N. urging them to 
mediate with the Kuwaiti authorities to review sentences issued 
against Jordanian nationals. Recently, the Foreign Ministry 
called the ambassadors of the five permanent members of the U.N. 
Security Council seeking their countries' mediation in the issue 
and calling for retrials of the Jordanians, most of them accused 
of "collaborating" with Iraq during its six-month occupation of 
Kuwait. The Foreign Ministry has also called several 
ambassadors of Arab states in Amman for the same purpose. It 
has also contacted Jordanian diplomatic missions in Arab and 
Islamic states and at international organisations to continue 
their efforts in this regard.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "An invitation To End Captivity"] </F>
  [Text] While we deeply respect every sincere effort and the 
good offices that have been exerted concerning the issue of the 
prisoners, and while we appreciate and understand the motives of 
the ongoing visits to world countries to keep this issue alive 
in the world's conscience, it is not easy for us to say that 
this method will not produce results and will not advance this 
issue one iota. 
  The world may sympathize with our suffering and understand 
our insistence and why we are losing patience. The countries in 
the world will continue to loudly declare that the prisoners 
have every right to be set free. They might couple this with a 
condemnation of the Iraqi regime for its violation of human 
rights and UN principles. But, none of what we seek will be 
realized. Of course, this is neither a call for despair, or an 
attempt to absolve an issue that concerns every Kuwaiti, and to 
that effect, every free man in the world. We are just stating a 
fact with the realization that keeping silent about it, or 
trying to hide it will not serve anyone. 
  You want your prisoners? Then, stop deceiving yourselves and 
say it as frankly as possible because you know it well. If you 
lack the courage to do so, we find no harm in declaring it on 
your behalf: 
  We will say that it is a political issue before a 
humanitarian issue. It is a card in the hands of the alliance 
countries, specifically the Western countries. They have their 
own strategic calculations, which do not necessarily tally with 
our national or regional calculations. It is high time for us 
to understand that they do not want to change the current 
situation because it represents an ideal state that is needed to 
have circumstances that will help bring a new move on the Gulf 
map to fruition. They want to keep the area crucified on the 
cross of the prisoners and of other outstanding issues until 
they complete the rearrangement of the state of affairs in other 
areas that have more priority on their strategic agenda. 
  In light of this reality, we call for a qualitative move to 
redress the course and end this state of begging for a solution, 
to begin shaping a new reality that will force the Western 
countries to change their course and tackle the issue of the 
prisoners and the demarcation of borders -- not as a Kuwaiti 
issue but as a Gulf issue that endangers regional security. 
  The best thing that we can do to control this new reality is 
to establish a strategic regional group with the Gulf 
Cooperation Council countries at the center, flanked by Syria 
and Iran. Then, we can tell the Western countries: Leave our 
countries, as we no longer need your services, and Saddam's army 
is no more than a scarecrow with which we know how to deal. You 
will then be astonished to see how well the Western countries 
can actively and positively move to align their stand with this 
new reality to secure the interests they have in this regional 
group, even if the price needed for this is Saddam's head. 
Otherwise, we shall remain captives with our prisoners, moaning 
in Baghdad's prisons.

  [Excerpts] Riyadh, 31 Jan -- King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz Al 
Sa'ud, custodian of the two holy mosques, this afternoon 
presided over the weekly meeting of the Council of Ministers at 
al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh. 
  In a statement to SPA after the session, Information 
Minister 
'Ali Hasan al-Sha'ir said: The custodian of the two holy mosques 
opened the session with a comprehensive analysis of some issues 
concerning current events at the Arab and international level. 
  Through a critical review of the current situation in the 
Arab arena, and in light of new developments in the course of 
the Palestinian issue and on the basis of the persistent 
historical role played by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia devotedly 
and sincerely in support of the Palestinian people since the 
painful tragedy of their suffering started until now, the king 
made clear to the council the nature of the meeting held 
recently between him and Yasir 'Arafat, president of the State 
of Palestine and chairman of the PLO's Executive Committee. He 
said that he had wished success for the positive initiative 
'Arafat had undertaken and for the attempts that were still 
being made and persisting on the peace path to achieve autonomy 
for the Palestinian people in the territory of their homeland in 
the form that would satisfy them and which they would view as 
appropriate to their aspirations. [passage omitted] 
  The information minister went on to say in his statement: 
  Following that, the beloved king talked about the economic 
condition of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and praised the right 
steps taken to reduce expenditure in order, God willing, to 
reach the expected balance over the coming years, pointing to 
the movement for economic revival through which the Kingdom is 
living, coupled with the continued growth of the trade movement 
and the noticeable banking activity, to which the reports of 
financial and economic experts referred. He said that one of the 
distinguished Saudi economic position is the excellent financial 
results which companies participating in vital sectors, such as 
baking and industry, started to announce. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] His Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, 
president of the state, has reiterated that the Bosnian tragedy 
and the massacres carried out against the Bosnian Muslim people 
are a terrible catastrophe never before seen in history. He 
added that this tragedy is also a disgrace to all those who 
could put an end to this issue, but do nothing and stand as 
spectators. This came, during a meeting yesterday, with His 
Excellency Pablo Puente, the Vatican's ambassador to Lebanon and 
envoy of Pope John Paul II. The president added that the 
position of America and Europe will forever remain shameful and 
disgraceful. He said: In fact, their position is disgraceful 
from top to bottom. 
  The president said: These countries not only refrain from 
helping or protecting the oppressed party, but they ban it from 
receiving arms to defend itself and its property. In fact, 
these countries, which have the military power to deter the 
oppressor and assist the oppressed, do not support justice. It 
is as if they are helping the oppressor against the oppressed. 
  Shaykh Zayid added: The Islamic nations, which witness and 
follow up these daily massacres that are taking place under the 
eyes of the European countries, believe that there is a 
tendentious plot against the Islamic minority in Europe. The 
Islamic nations also believe there is an attempt to suppress and 
liquidate the Muslims. He said: Such a thing cannot take place 
in the Islamic world against any minority because Islamic law 
bans any coercion against the Christian minority. At the same 
time, however, Muslims each day see the Muslim people of Bosnia 
being slaughtered like sheep. God may give someone time, but He 
will never forget. 
  Regarding the dialogue between Muslims and Christians, his 
highness the president of the state welcomed this dialogue for 
the sake of peace and mankind's prosperity, noting that the 
teachings of the heavenly religions should be applied. He said 
that the Islamic world is committed to implementing Islamic law, 
God's book, and the prophet's sayings. Therefore, he added, the 
Christians should also apply the sound teachings of their 
religion, follow their holy book, and work for the well-being 
and prosperity of mankind. [passage omitted]

  [Text] India has told the United Arab Emirates [UAE] that 
Pakistan is indulging in cheap propaganda on Kashmir to keep a 
nonissue alive. The civil aviation minister, Mr. Ghulam Nabi 
Azad, apprised the UAE leaders of the anti-India tirade launched 
by Islamabad. He held wide-ranging discussions in Dubayy with 
the labor minister, Mr. Sayf al-Jarwan who virtually holds the 
number two position in the UAE government. Mr. Azad regretted 
that Islamabad looks at every bilateral issue through the prism 
of Kashmir, making a meaningful dialogue difficult. He squarely 
blamed Pakistan for the problem in Kashmir and said Islamabad is 
fomenting the trouble to further its own political interests. 
The civil aviation minister also said that India is not sure 
whether a commitment made by one government in Pakistan will be 
honored by the next government. He pointed out that the late 
Pakistan prime minister, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, had committed to 
resolving the bilateral problems within the framework of the 
Simla agreement. 
  The UAE minister, Mr. Jarwan, appreciated India's 
achievements as also the steps taken for maintaining stability 
and communal harmony. He assured Mr. Azad that the Indian 
community in UAE will be well protected.

  [Excerpt] Sanaa, Jan 29 (AFP) -- Negotiations were underway 
Saturday [29 January] to free three French tourists kidnapped by 
Yemeni tribesmen at odds with the government, with officials 
here saying the three were unharmed. 
  The tourists, including two women, were seized last Sunday 
by 
tribesmen in a bid to force the Yemeni government to build a 
road through their region, Yemeni sources and French officials 
said Friday. 
  They were being "treated like guests and their security is 
not in danger," an interior ministry source told AFP on 
Saturday. The ministry is negotiating their release. 
  Another source familiar with the negotiations and who 
declined to be identified said talks between the kidnappers and 
the authorities had still not made progress. 
  The three were abducted on Sunday in Hajjah province, 200 
kilometers (120 miles) northwest of the capital Sanaa, while on 
a tour organized by Club Aventure (Adventure Club), company 
director Yves Godeau said in Paris. 
  Terres d'Aventure (Lands of Adventure) denied earlier 
reports 
from Yemen that it was the tour operator involved. 
  Ahnum tribesmen were holding Henri Heslot and his wife, both 
retired agriculture professors, as well as cardiologist Brigitte 
Fontaine, 42, to press the government into building a road 
through their region. 
  The powerful Hashid tribes, whose land surrounds the Ahnum, 
have altered the direction of the road. 
  "The kidnappers don't want to endanger the lives of the 
three 
French (tourists), but are protesting against the chief of the 
Hashid tribes, Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, who altered the 
direction of the road," the source said. 
  Al-Ahmar, who is Yemen's parliamentary speaker, heads the 
Islamic al-Islah Party, which is part of the government 
coalition. 
  In Paris, the French Foreign Ministry said the French 
embassy 
in Sanaa had asked the authorities to try to obtain their 
immediate release and said the three were in "good health and 
well treated." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sanaa, Jan 30 (AFP) -- Tribesmen have cut off 
supplies to a remote mountain village in northwestern Yemen 
where three French tourists are being held hostage, sources said 
here Sunday. 
  Hashid tribesmen surrounding Madan village, 200 kilometers 
(120 miles) northwest of the capital Sanaa, blocked all access 
routes to force the surrender of the kidnappers, from the rival 
Ahnum tribe. 
  Last Sunday Ahnum tribesmen seized Henri Heslot and his 
wife, 
both retired agriculture professors, as well as cardiologist 
Brigitte Fontaine, 42, to press the government into diverting a 
road through their region. 
  A Yemeni interior ministry source told AFP on Saturday the 
ministry was negotiating for the hostages' release, and they 
were being "treated like guests and their security is not in 
danger." 
  Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, chief of the Hashid, had also 
sent 
an envoy to the village, sources said. 
  Al-Ahmar, who is Yemen's parliamentary speaker, heads the 
Islamic al-Islah Party, which is part of the government 
coalition. 
  Negotiators said Sunday the Ahnum tribesmen had vowed they 
would "not surrender, even if we all have to die." 
  Other sources reported divisions among the Ahnum over the 
kidnapping of women and elderly people, considered contrary to 
the tribe's "code of honour." 
  The three were abducted while on a tour organized by Club 
Aventure (Adventure Club), company director Yves Godeau said in 
Paris. 
  The Ahnum were demanding that a road be built bypassing 
Hashid land, so that their goods could be delivered to other 
parts of the country safely, officials said. 
  However, the powerful Hashid tribes, whose land surrounds 
the 
Ahnum, had altered the direction of the road. 
  In Paris, the French Foreign Ministry said the French 
Embassy 
in Sanaa had asked the authorities to try to obtain the 
hostages' immediate release and said the three were in "good 
health and well treated." 
  Yemeni sources added that the tourists were being kept in a 
house with electricity and warm water and were able to read 
newspapers and books which a tribal leader had passed on to them 
from the French Embassy. 
  In the past few months tribesmen have repeatedly kidnapped 
foreigners, including Western oil workers, to put pressure on 
the Yemeni government.

  [Text] Sanaa, Feb 1 (AFP) -- The authorities in Yemen have 
told tribesmen holding three French tourists hostage for more 
than a week to free them "immediately" in exchange for pledge to 
look into demands for a road into the tribesmen's remote 
mountain fief. 
  Reliable Yemeni sources said the government had given the 
promise in a letter signed by 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-'Ansi, deputy 
prime minister and general secretary of the Islamic 
fundamentalist Al-Islah party and by fellow deputy prime 
minister Mujahid Abu-Shawarib. 
  Abu-Shawarib is himself a native of the region where the 
three French tourists are being held about 200 kilometers (120 
miles) north west of Sanaa. 
  The letter was due to be delivered late on Monday to the 
mountain village of Al-Madhan more than eight hours by road and 
trail from the capital. 
  The move follows a decision announced on Sunday by the 
al-Hashid tribe whose territory adjoins Al-Madhan to halt 
supplies of food to the rebel village in order to force the 
kidnappers into surrendering. 
  The men who seized the French tourists belong to the smaller 
Ahnum tribe who claim to be penalised because the only road to 
their enclave goes through al-Hashid territory with the result 
that often their farm produce is confiscated. 
  A road to be built in the region was initially due to go 
through Ahnum territory but was later diverted to go through 
al-Hashid land. 
  A report in the English-language YEMEN TIMES Monday said the 
ministry of public works had come under strong pressure from the 
al-Hashid tribal chief Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar who 
is also president of parliament to re-route the road so as to 
skirt the Ahnum enclave. 
  The letter delivered Monday reportedly said "the path of the 
road will be reexamined if the French hostages are released." 
  Henri Haslot and his wife, both retired agronomy teachers in 
their seventies and 42-year-old Brigitte Fontaine were kidnapped 
at gunpoint on January 23 as they were travelling on the road 
from Sa'dah in the extreme north of Yemen. 
  A French foreign ministry spokesman Monday said the three 
were "well treated and in good health". 
  The YEMEN TIMES showed a photograph of the three French 
tourists sitting smiling with a village man at their side. 
  The paper said there had been at least 11 similar cases in 
the past three years, and that all of them had come to a 
negotiated settlement. 
  It said several countries had advised their nationals not to 
go to Yemen unless it was absolutely necessary.

  [Text] Yemeni Minister of Interior Brigadier General Yahya 
al-Mutawakkil has denied that the kidnapping of three French 
nationals northwest of Sanaa last week was politically motivated. 
  In press statements today, he added that the kidnappers 
motive in taking the three hostages, one man and two women, is 
to provoke the government and make unrealistic demands. He went 
on to say that his ministry has taken practical measures to 
besiege the kidnappers in case they do not surrender and free 
the hostages.

<F P=106> [Interview with Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, speaker of the </F>
Yemeni House of Representatives, by Salih al-Qallab in Sanaa; 
date not given] 
  [Text] [Al-Qallab] We have heard that you have reservations 
on some points in the document of understanding. Which are 
these points? 
  [Al-Ahmar] In the first place, I want to say that our 
acceptance of the dialogue that led to this document was based 
on our eagerness to maintain the Yemeni unity. Our acceptance 
of most of what the document contains was based on the desire to 
satisfy the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] because it hinted at 
separation, and we do not want separation. 
  [Al-Qallab] But what are your reservations? 
  [Al-Ahmar] We have reservations, and the team that 
represented us in the dialogue registered these reservations in 
the minutes of the meetings. 
  [Al-Qallab] Are your reservations on the point concerning 
local government, or are there other issues? 
  [Al-Ahmar] We have reservations on more than one issue, but 
as I said we accepted dialogue in the first place for the sake 
of unity, and we offered several concessions to the YSP since 
the beginning of unity and until today for the sake of unity. 
  [Al-Qallab] Do your reservations mean that you do not accept 
this document? 
  [Al-Ahmar] No, we accept the document, but we have 
reservations on some of its points. 
  [Al-Qallab] What is one of these points? 
  [Al-Ahmar] One of these points is that we reject the 
division 
of Yemen into regions or semi-states. Yemen should be divided 
into administrative units, which are the governorates. 
  [Al-Qallab] We heard that you insist that the document 
should 
be worked out by the House of Representatives and not by the 
dialogue committee that represents the main parties. Is that 
true? 
  [Al-Ahmar] This is untrue. The dialogue committee is not a 
constitutional establishment. The House of Representatives is 
the legislative establishment. The document includes some 
procedural points that do not need parliamentary approval, and 
includes other topics that should be presented to the House of 
Representatives because they conflict with the constitution. 
  [Al-Qallab] President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih received an 
invitation from His Majesty King Husayn to meet in Jordan. Do 
you think this meeting will end the crisis? 
  [Al-Ahmar] If, after the signing of the document in Jordan, 
the brothers in the YSP return to Sanaa to carry out their 
duties, then this will be the beginning of resolving the crisis, 
but if after the signing everyone returns to his present 
position and to where he is now, then nothing will change and 
the crisis will continue. 
  [Al-Qallab] Did you settle this issue with the YSP? 
  [Al-Ahmar] The dialogue committee is continuing its efforts, 
and it is the party that can answer your question. 
  [Al-Qallab] Does this mean that you want the president and 
the vice president to return to Sanaa aboard the same plane 
after they sign the agreement in Amman? 
  [Al-Ahmar] Yes. This is a natural thing if we want the 
crisis to end and the document to be implemented. 
  [Al-Qallab] But the brothers in the YSP say that there have 
to be security measures before they return to Sanaa so they can 
resume their normal duties. 
  [Al-Ahmar] This is a pretext. Since unity was achieved, 
they have been safe among us. Their brothers in the north 
received them with open arms. 
  [Al-Qallab] But if you remember the famous incident when 
Prime Minister al-'Attas's motorcade was stopped at a checkpoint 
and was about to be prevented from entering Sanaa? 
  [Al-Ahmar] This is not true. What happened is that when a 
large motorcade arrived at that checkpoint, the policemen only 
wanted to check the identity of the official who was escorted by 
this large motorcade. When they found out who he was they 
saluted him and let the motorcade proceed. 
  [Al-Qallab] The brothers in the YSP say they have lost 
around 152 officials in explosions and assassinations and that 
their houses and families were constantly harassed. 
  [Al-Ahmar] This is a big lie, and if we wanted to escalate 
things, we would sue them for such claims. 
  [Al-Qallab] What is the case, then? 
  [Al-Ahmar] All these figures are incorrect, except for one 
or two. They know who did the killings. 
  [Al-Qallab] The YSP says its leaders will not go back to 
Sanaa before the suspects in the assassinations and explosions 
are tried and military troops are withdrawn from the cities? 
  [Al-Ahmar] The first demand is approved by everybody. Yes, 
we insist that the criminals be tried and security be achieved. 
We are against sheltering or abetting criminals. 
  [Al-Qallab] What about withdrawing the army from the cities? 
  [Al-Ahmar] We in Sanaa regard the Armed Forces as the 
protectors of the homeland and of Sanaa. The Army of the Yemeni 
Arab Republic has never gone on a rampage in Sanaa as the YSP 
Army did in Aden. 
  [Al-Qallab] It is said that Yemeni authorities have managed 
to seize some lists of the names of the "Jihad" group that is 
behind the incidents in Yemen and some incidents in Egypt. Is 
this true? 
  [Al-Ahmar] Investigations have proven that all those 
elements and their camps are in the southern and eastern 
governorates. None of them is in the north. 
  [Al-Qallab] But the lists Egypt handed over to the Yemeni 
envoys speak differently. 
  [Al-Ahmar] No such lists have been handed over. The 
Egyptians say it was Aden Governor Salih Munassar al-Siyali who 
informed them about the presence of extremists' camps in the 
north during a secret visit to Egypt. This is an unfounded 
falsehood. 
  [Al-Qallab] But, Shaykh 'Abdallah, foreign oil experts 
continue to be kidnapped in the north and this harms the 
reputation of Yemen. 
  [Al-Ahmar] These kidnappings are directed by the YSP in 
order 
to underscore the impression that the security situation in the 
north is unstable and that there are terrorist acts and 
kidnappings. All elements undertaking these vile operations are 
supported by the YSP. 
  [Al-Qallab] Reports say the three tourists whose release is 
now being negotiated were kidnapped by the Hashid tribe. 
  [Al-Ahmar] They belong to the al-Ahfum tribe, which 
sometimes 
says it is from Hashid and other times from Bakil. It is a 
small tribe, but the ones who kidnapped them are from the YSP, 
from Sufyan. They did so in return for 100,000 riyals. 
  [Al-Qallab] Apparently, the gap between the three coalition 
parties--the YSP, the General People's Congress [GPC], and the 
Reform Grouping--is still very big. What step do you think is 
necessary to end the present crisis? 
  [Al-Ahmar] The first step is to unify the army. Unifying the 
army is the beginning of the unification of the state. We want 
the army to be an army for the whole country and not for 
parties. There is now an army for 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 
another for 'Ali Salim al-Bid. 
  [Al-Qallab] Some say there are four armies in Yemen: An army 
for 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, an army for 'Ali Salim al-Bid, an army 
for 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, and an army for the Reform Grouping. 
What is your opinion? 
  [Al-Ahmar] This is not true. There are only two armies. 
They are the army of the south, which is 'Ali Salim al-Bid's 
army, and the army of the north, which is 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's 
army. 
  [Al-Qallab] It is noted that following the recent crisis the 
state of affairs has reverted to the pre-unity stage. Has 
division become a fait accompli? 
  [Al-Ahmar] For your information, the situation now is much 
worse than it was before the unity. The bitterness existing now 
as a result of lack of confidence is much greater than that 
which existed four years ago. 
  [Al-Qallab] Why? 
  [Al-Ahmar] Because of lack of confidence and because unity 
was based on power sharing between the YSP and the GPC. I can 
frankly tell you that unity as well as pluralism and democracy 
have not entered the southern and eastern governorates.

  [Text] There are great doubts about the possibility of 
signing shortly an agreement struck by Yemeni parties almost two 
weeks ago. Apparently, the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] has set 
new conditions. The doubts exist because differences between 
the two parties to the political crisis have persisted. 
  Reports from Aden said several Yemeni politicians fear that 
the situation might explode in light of the military deployments 
by the rival parties. 
  A member of the committee that is tasked with setting a time 
and venue for a ceremony to sign the accord document, who 
demanded anonymity, has said that YSP Secretary General 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid has set new conditions for the signing. The 
committee member said the YSP wants to see, once the agreement 
is initialed, the implementation of its major clauses before a 
final settlement to the Yemeni crisis is reached. Al-Bid and 
other YSP officials, most of whom are in Aden, do not think it 
is necessary for them to go back to Sanaa after signing the 
agreement, even though the agreement stipulates their return. 
  The committee member said Culture Minister Jarallah 'Umar, 
the YSP representative, told the committee al-Bid will not go 
back to Sanaa before these clauses are implemented. 
  Al-Bid, who has been staying in Aden since 19 August 1993, 
wants security guarantees before he declares his readiness to 
sign the agreement, which was reached after extensive 
discussions that lasted two months. The agreement meets most of 
the YSP demands, especially with regard to a broad 
administrative decentralization and security arrangements. 
  The member asserted that representatives of the General 
People's Congress, led by Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
and the Yemeni Reform Grouping, under 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, have 
rejected this demand. They argue that the agreement is binding 
and that its implementation requires the contribution of all the 
leaders of the government coalition. 
  The member added that the YSP wants the signing ceremony to 
be attended by representatives from the United States, the 
European Union, Russia, the PRC, Canada, Syria, Saudi Arabia, in 
addition to Fahim al-Qasimi, the secretary general of the Gulf 
Cooperation Council. The purpose of this is to have more 
guarantees. 
  A source close to the president's party said this demand is 
part of political one-upmanship and efforts to internationalize 
the Yemeni crisis.

  [Text] The Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], led by 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, has stated its full and unqualified commitment to the 
document of accord recently agreed to by Yemeni parties to 
defuse the political crisis plaguing the country. 
  In a letter addressed to the Yemeni Political Forces 
Dialogue 
Committee, which initialed the document on 18 January, the YSP 
expressed its willingness to contribute to the implementation of 
the document in defense of Yemen's unity. 
  In the letter, which was published in Sanaa today, the YSP 
urged compliance with the provisions enshrined in the document. 
The YSP also warned against attempts to obstruct the 
implementation of the document. It reiterated that it is 
extremely concerned about avoiding media vituperations to help 
clear the political climate in the country. 
  The Political Forces Dialogue Committee, which includes the 
Yemeni coalition government parties as well as opposition 
parties, will hold its last meeting later today to endorse the 
draft accord that will be signed by the Yemeni president, his 
deputy, and the secretaries of Yemeni parties in the Jordanian 
capital on Sunday [6 February].

<F P=106> [Interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, assistant secretary </F>
general of the Yemeni Socialist Party, YSP, by AL-DUSTUR 
correspondent Salih al-Qallab, in Aden -- date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Al-Qallab] If some delay 
takes place in implementing the accord document after it is 
signed, will the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], which controls 
the largest part of Yemen, unilaterally implement it? 
  [Muhammad] Extensive and important discussions are being 
held 
at our leadership and cadres level and with the other parties to 
reach a clear answer to the question of what to do vis-a-vis 
this document. 
  It is very difficult to answer your question. We cannot say 
now that we will unilaterally implement the document if our 
partners in the coalition refuse to implement it. However, with 
respect to issues that need no constitutional amendments, that 
do not conflict with laws in force which are adopted by the 
legitimate authorities, I say that we have the right to 
implement them in areas where it is possible to do so. [passage 
omitted] 
  We will avoid everything that violates the Constitution, 
harms unity and could be interpreted as being part of the 
establishment of a second state. We will continue dialogue with 
all the parties concerned to achieve what one can call a white 
revolution. 
  [Al-Qallab] It is obvious that the YSP is inclined to sign 
this document outside Yemen while others believe the signing 
should take place on Yemeni soil. Why are you prefer to sign it 
abroad? 
  [Muhammad] We, in the YSP, prefer that the document be 
signed 
in Jordan for three reasons: 
  The first is that the brothers in Jordan had suggested at 
the 
start of the crisis that a meeting between the president and his 
vice president take place in Amman. Brothers 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih and Salim al-Bid agreed to this. [passage omitted] 
  The second reason is that, this time, we want witnesses. We 
want an Arab presence, other than the Jordanian brothers. We 
proposed that the anticipated Amman meeting be attended by 
neighboring countries. There is a direct connection, for 
example, between the issue and the brothers in Oman, in Saudi 
Arabia, and in Eritrea, not to mention Egypt, Syria, the PLO, 
and the Arab League. 
  We want these fraternal countries to be represented at a 
high 
level. Also, there are some foreign countries which from the 
beginning have shown an interest in the need to seek a solution 
for the Yemeni crisis and to safeguard Yemeni unity. These 
countries should be invited to the Amman meeting, particularly 
France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. 
  The third reason is that I believe that the Yemeni crisis is 
still acute, particularly concerning its military and security 
dimension. While we take the first steps, during the signing 
ceremony, we do not want to see any security breaches that might 
inflame the situation and destroy all the achievements that have 
been attained. 
  In other words, if the signing ceremony takes place in a 
Yemeni area or city, every party or group attending the meeting 
will be escorted by huge security forces. In such a case, it is 
not far-fetched that, intentionally or not, a misunderstanding 
could take place between this or that person. This would lead 
to a catstrophe because the situation and atmophere are very 
tense. Huge efforts, including those of the Jordanian brothers, 
have been made to prevent this. 
  We believe that the signing of the document in fraternal 
Jordan will guarantee the safety of all, including the brothers 
and friends who will be invited to attend. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Qallab] We have noticed that all the YSP leaders, 
including the vice president and the prime minister have moved 
from Sanaa to Aden. Is this some kind of a strong protest 
against a specific situation, for security reasons, or to avoid 
an eruption of the situation, particularly at this stage? 
  [Muhammad] There are two reasons: Security in Sanaa, 
regrettably, is not available, particularly for the leaders and 
members of our party. This is substantiated by the fact that 
many of our houses have been attacked, and we have lost several 
of our leaders and cadres in broad daylight. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Qallab] When will you return to Sanaa? 
  [Muhammad] We decided to have our brothers in the House of 
Representatives return and assume their duties. But, with 
respect to some leaders, the causes which forced them to leave 
Sanaa should first be remedied. 
  [Al-Qallab] We have heard that 'Ali Nasir Muhammad might 
return to Aden. Have matters been definitively settled with 
that wing of the YSP? 
  [Muhamma] Yes. This issue has been closed for more than two 
years now. With respect to brother 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, we have 
no objection to his return to Aden. We welcome him. 
  We have settled all differences and have closed the January 
incidents file on the basis of dialogue and alliance, and the 
formation of a broad front of all the forces, parties, and 
figures to complete the unity project.

  [Text] The Standing Committee of the General People's 
Congress [GPC] this evening concluded its extraordinary session, 
which was chaired by brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih, the chairman of the Presidential Council and the GPC's 
secretary general. The session continued to review the items on 
its agenda, addressing national developments, including the 
document of pledge and accord among the political parties to 
emerge from the political crisis and build the new Yemeni state. 
  The discussions of the members of the Standing Committee 
focused on the means to implement the pledge and accord 
agreement and the GPC's future tasks. 
  The brother secretary general delivered a speech at the end 
of the GPC's work in which he reviewed national developments and 
the GPC's relevant stands. He stressed the need to shoulder our 
national responsibilities at this crucial stage in the history 
of our people and country and overcome all the negativism and 
false steps witnessed by our Yemeni homeland during the 
transitional period and thereafter. He indicated that our 
people have suffered much from the crisis and that all concerned 
should measure up to their responsibilities and rise above minor 
issues and subordinate everthing else to the interest of the 
homeland. 
  The Standing Committee adopted a number of internal 
decisions 
and measures. A press release was issued at the end of the 
extraordinary session of the GPC's Standing Committee. 
Following is its text: 
  In a climate full of confidence and hope, the GPC's Standing 
Committee held an extraordinary session on 19-20 Sha'ban, 1413 
hegira, corresponding to 30-31 January, 1994 under brother 
secretary general of the GPC, Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the 
chairman of the Presidential Council. The session was devoted 
to a discussion of the present general state of affairs in light 
of the document of pledge and accord drafted by the Yemeni 
Political Forces Dialogue Committee on 18 January, 1994. As 
well as reviewing the contents of the document, the Standing 
Committee studied the reports related to the progress of the 
national dialogue and its ramifications on all fronts and the 
subsequent developments and intensive contacts to prepare for 
the final signing of the document. In this regard, the GPC's 
Standing Committee expressed its full support for the GPC's 
statement issued on 18 January, which announced the GPC's 
acceptance of the document reached by the parties to the 
dialogue of the political forces to build the new Yemeni state. 
At the same time, the Standing Committee appreciated the 
efforts of the committee of the political forces and the 
document it worked out -- the document which the Standing 
Committee believes to be a program for the next stage in the 
life of the Yemeni people, who entered the modern age when they 
restored their unity on 22 May, 1990 and chose the democratic 
road of its own free will, the crowning day of which was 27 
April, 1993. 
  In this context, the Standing Committee asserts that 
commitment to this document and eagerness to implement it truly 
embody the depth of commitment to the democratic option, which 
the GPC was the first to adopt. 
  The accord document is a further contribution to the 
efforts to firmly establish democracy in the life of the state 
and society. This requires collective action by all forces and 
the mobilization of all energies to implement it creatively to 
ensure that it is transformed into practical steps on the 
ground. The exceptional importance of this document stems not 
only from the fact that it has put an end to the political 
crisis from which our homeland and people have suffered, but 
because it serves as a safety valve which will ensure that 
similar crises will not recur in the future, and will abort any 
sedition and plots aimed at harming the unity and democracy. 
  Hence the need for and importance of the practical 
implementation of this document by all parties to the state's 
institutions as soon as the document signing ceremony is over. 
This is the true yardstick for measuring the high national 
responsibility and ability to transcend narrow interests and 
adopt the supreme interests of the homeland and people. 
Undoubtedly, implementing the accord document with maximum 
success requires that all efforts be united through full 
cohesion among all national, legislative, and executive 
departments and institutions of the state and that the 
implementation process be spared any acts of one-upmanship. 
Throughout the duration of the political crisis, such acts have 
gravely harmed the state and society, thus endangering the 
homeland's unity, security, and stability, and even the life and 
future of every Yemeni citizen. 
  In this context, the Standing Committee emphasizes the 
importance of making available the appropriate atmosphere for 
the final signing of the accord document. Meanwhile, most 
regrettably, it has noticed the unjustified continuation of some 
ramifications of the crisis, especially the cessation of the 
general census of the population, houses, and installations 
while it is in its final stage, in addition to some media 
ramifications. The Standing Committee believes that if the 
course of dialogue, accord, and mutual concessions at the table 
of a national, responsible dialogue has resulted in this 
national document, which has won broad popular support, then the 
continuation of this course within the framework of commitment 
to constitutional legitimacy and its institutions and abidance 
by the tasks and powers as specified by the Constitution and law 
will provide sufficient protection for all stages of the actual 
implementation of this document. Besides, the existence of a 
broader popular participation in the programs of implementation 
will enhance the possibility of implementing the document and 
will prevent any attempt to shirk abidance by the document. 
  In this regard, the Standing Committee believes that 
building 
the modern Yemeni state is a great historic process that cannot 
be achieved without the broadest possible popular participation, 
especially by political forces and national intellectuals who 
really believe that the state of law and order, the state of 
institutions, and the state of stable constitutional legitimacy 
that is based on the people's free will, is the main objective 
which has been sought since the homeland restored its unity on 
22 May 1990. This objective was at the forefront of the 
national tasks of the 27 September and 14 October glorious 
revolutions. 
  In light of this, everybody is called on today to renounce 
the methods followed during the transitional period and to 
resort to new methods that are in harmony with the historical 
nature of this lofty national mission which we should accomplish 
with one political will and with high national responsibility to 
rise to our greater national objectives sought by our masses to 
live a secure and stable life in a climate of justice, freedom, 
and equality. 
  Given the large-scale Arab and international support for the 
document of pledge and accord, the Standing Committee expresses 
its satisfaction with this great national and international 
response and thanks all brothers and friends who expressed their 
concern over our country's unity and democratic experiment. 
Those brothers and friends spared no effort to reach a 
satisfactory end to the political crisis. They also blessed the 
document of pledge and accord reached by the dialogue among the 
Yemeni political forces. 
  As the GPC Standing Committee ends this extraordinary 
session, it greets and appreciates our people who have suffered 
a great deal throughout the crisis which endangered the people's 
food, security, and future. Despite all this, our people showed 
great patience and readiness to make sacrifices to safeguard 
unity and democracy. Our valiant Armed Forces proved to be a 
shield that protects the homeland and its unity and that they 
will never become a tool to destroy the homeland and shed the 
blood of its sons. 
  On this occasion, the Standing Committee renews the pledge 
that the GPC will always remain -- as it has always been -- 
loyal to the interests of the homeland and people, concerned 
about their unity, safety, and stability, and determined to 
proceed on the road toward prosperity and progress for all the 
sons of the people. 
  Let us move together toward the future; let us converge 
efforts to triumph in the battle for construction. Let us work 
together to build the edifice of the modern Yemeni state. Let 
us always raise high the banners of unity and democracy. Our 
God will grant us success as He is our best supporter. 
  Issued by the GPC Standing Committee at the conclusion of 
its 
extraordinary session in Sanaa on 31 January 1994.

  [Text] Sanaa, 31 Jan (INA)--The Arab League has expressed 
its willingness to host a reconciliation summit between Yemeni 
President Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Yemeni 
Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid. It invited them and the other 
parties concerned [to Cairo] to endorse the document of accord 
recently agreed upon by Yemeni parties to defuse the crisis. 
  The invitation came in a telephone call to Yemeni Vice 
President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, who is in Aden, from Arab League 
Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid. 
  It was reported that the Arab League secretary general 
informed al-Bid of the Arab League's willingness to host, at the 
Arab League Headquarters, the reconciliation meeting of the 
parties concerned so that they may sign the accord document. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid also welcomed the participation in such a 
meeting of all the Arab and friendly sides that might want to 
attend the document signing ceremony--the parties whose 
attendance at such a ceremony is deemed necessary.

  [Text] Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice chairman of the 
Presidential Council, this afternoon received a telephone call 
from his brother Arab League Secretary General 'Ismat 
'Abd-al-Majid, who said the Arab League welcomed the accord 
document worked out and initialed by the Political Forces 
Dialogue Committee. 'Abd-al-Majid stressed the Arab League's 
invitation to host all the concerned fraternal and friendly 
parties that the sides signing the document believe should 
attend. He also stressed the Arab League's support for all 
efforts to end the crisis facing our country in order to draw up 
sound bases and to build a modern Yemeni state. 
  On behalf of brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council, Foreign Minister Muhammad 
Salim Basindwah today received a telephone call from Arab League 
Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, who expressed his 
desire to see the document of accord signed at the Arab League 
Headquarters in Cairo. 
  The foreign minister conveyed the greetings of the chairman 
of the Presidential Council and informed him that, after failure 
to sign the document in Yemen, the chairman of the Presidential 
Council would have been pleased to see the Yemeni document of 
pledge and accord document signed at the Arab League, if some 
parties in the committee stemming from the expanded National 
Dialogue Committee had not demanded that the signing ceremony 
take place in the Jordanian capital, Amman. He said that the 
General People's Congress leadership agreed to this demand, and, 
therefore, it would be difficult to change the venue of the 
planned signing ceremony, especially since the brother officials 
in fraternal Jordan have begun preparations for the ceremony, in 
addition to their commendable efforts.

  [Excerpt] Cairo--Arab political sources in Cairo have 
revealed that Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are working to foil any 
mediation to end the political crisis in Yemen. 
  The sources, which refused to be identified, told AL-SAFIR 
that a Saudi-Kuwaiti coordinated effort recently sought to abort 
the Document of Pledge and Accord even if this required 
arranging a military coup in the north that would destroy 
support for unity. 
  The sources added that Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are providing 
some Yemeni parties with suspicious reports about the mediation 
efforts of Mujahid Abu-Shawarib and are accusing him of working 
for the Iraqi intelligence service and of receiving regular 
financing to exploit the differences between the Yemeni sides in 
favor of augmenting the role of Yemen's Ba'th Party. 
  The sources stressed that the hot lines between Saudi 
Arabia, 
Kuwait, and Aden are constantly busy and that financial aid sent 
to Yemen during the crisis reached $500 million. 
  The sources referred to the hasty return of 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, Yemeni vice president and secretary general of the 
Socialist Party, to Aden from Washington in 1993 and to the 
subsequent eruption of differences. 
  The sources said that al-Bid was originally scheduled to 
travel to France and Jordan for treatment but actually visited 
Washington to meet with U.S. Vice President Al Gore. They added 
that the meeting between al-Bid and Gore was held in Washington 
in the absence of the Yemeni ambassador and that al-Bid returned 
directly to Aden, where he adopted the policy of seclusion. 
  The sources linked Saudi-Kuwaiti efforts to abort Yemeni 
reconciliation to Saudi Arabia's insistence on continuing joint 
meetings with Yemen on demarcating the borders. They said that 
Saudi Arabia wants to negotiate with an unstable party to obtain 
as much as possible. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ['Abdallah Hammudah report: "Yemeni Jews Appeal to Interior </F>
Minister To Protect Them From Enticements and Threats of 
Foreigners"] 
  [Text] London -- Yemeni Jews have appealed to Interior and 
Security Minister Brigadier General Yahya al-Mutawakkil to "ward 
off the harm from American and British Jews" and to help them 
"keep their Yemeni citizenship and live in their country, the 
country of their forefathers." 
  This came in a letter in Arabic sent to Brig. Gen. 
al-Mutawakkil by Yemeni Jews and signed in Hebrew by nine of 
their dignitaries, protesting against the Zionist campaign which 
exploits the "poor financial situation" in Yemen to make them 
emigrate to Israel "with financial enticements." 
  It is worth noting that an American Jew of Yemeni origin by 
the name of Moshe Yarimi and a Jewish Swiss journalist by the 
name of Oneger are currently in Yemen. The latter is 
accompanied on his tour of the cities of Sa'dah and Raydah by 
Muhammad al-Juraydi, an employee of the Yemeni Information 
Ministry, which helps him move around and which also arouses 
fears among Yemeni Jews about their continuing to live in Yemen 
and encouragement to emigrate to Israel. 
  While Yemeni Jews welcome religious groups of their faith 
who 
visit them and bring books and educational literature such as 
Naturi Carta, known as Guards of the City, which help them 
within their community, they express surprise at the Yemeni 
authorities' lack of response so far to their requests for 
protection from "foreign corruption," in the form sometimes of 
enticement and sometimes threats. Joseph Kaplan and Yosef Amar, 
two American Jewish assistants of Shlomo Grafi, representative 
of the Jewish Agency which actively works for the emigration of 
Jews to Israel, visited Yemen last month and distributed sums of 
money to Yemeni Jews. Kaplan succeeded in leaving with a Yemeni 
Jewish woman whom he married on the way to Israel via European 
capitals or New York. 
  Yosef Amar remained [in Yemen] after that for two weeks, 
during which he worked for the emigration of a Yemeni Jew by the 
name of Harun Murji to Israel to join one of his two wives who 
preceded him there without the knowledge of his other wife, whom 
he intended to leave behind in Yemen to join him later. 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that Moshe Yarimi managed to 
get close to a tribal chief in the area of Sa'dah and persuaded 
him to threaten one of the Jews opposed to emigration to Israel. 
It reached a point where that chief pointed his gun at the Jew 
and threatened that "he would kill him if he continued to 
instigate others against the Americans." 
  The letter addressed to the Yemeni interior minister 
mentioned that and said "we wish to inform you that we have 
received ultimatums and threats that they will make some corrupt 
people harm us unless we give in to them." 
  Observers believe that the Zionist groups, whose work in 
Yemen is coordinated by a special committee directly attached to 
the Israeli prime minister's office, use American and European 
Jews to fulfill their mission and they exploit the current 
liberal atmosphere in Yemen and the weak government presence in 
the northern areas, a matter which facilitates their task.

  [Text] Baghdad, 31 Jan (INA) -- AL-QADISIYAH has warned 
some Gulf countries of the seriousness of their plans to 
cooperate with the Zionist entity in the field of energy. 
  In an article today, the paper notes a statement by a 
Zionist 
Energy Ministry spokeswoman that her government has received 
offers from some Gulf regimes to supply it with natural gas in 
line with cooperation agreements between the Zionist entity and 
Gulf regimes, including the Saudi regime and the rulers imposed 
on Kuwait. 
  The paper adds: The devils are eager to supply the enemies 
of the nation with all the means of strength and existence, even 
before they sign a single item of the settlement accords. The 
parties to the settlement process are making more concessions so 
the Zionists will agree to sign these accords. 
  The paper goes on: Iraq wanted those people to hold their 
heads high and to be loyal to their peoples, religion, heritage, 
and history. However, they chose treason and plunged their 
poisoned daggers into the backs of those who sought to protect 
them and who sacrificed the blood of their sons to protect them 
and save their dignity and glory. 
  The Mother of Battles shall remain a major turning point in 
the history of humanity and in the struggle for man's glory and 
dignity.

  [Text] Baghdad, 30 Jan (INA)--The newspaper AL-THAWRAH says 
that the U.S. decision to supply the Zionist entity with 
sophisticated assault warplanes exposes Washington's serious 
course of handling international issues and flash points all 
over the world. 
  In an article published today, the paper, which speaks for 
the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, adds that the Zionist entity is 
known for its expansionist course, for its use of force and 
military aggression to consecrate its occupation of Arab and 
Palestinian territories, and even for military aggression 
against Arab countries not adjacent to Palestine, as happened in 
its aggression on Iraq and other Arab states. 
  The paper wonders how Washington can convince the Arabs that 
it can be an honest broker in Middle East peace talks when it 
makes moves to consecrate the Zionist aggression and ensure its 
superiority over the Arabs. 
  AL-THAWRAH goes on to say: Washington is talking of 
democracy and human rights at a time when it wages wars and 
kills tens of thousands of people in various parts of the world 
every year in the name of democracy. It has continued to 
provide the Zionist entity with unlimited military support 
despite this entity's criminal record, which is replete with 
repression and human rights abuses. The United States has chosen 
to overlook the Zionists' criminal record, their demolition of 
Palestinian homes, and their detention every day of hundreds of 
Palestinians. It has continued to provide the Zionists with 
additional sophisticated weapons. It is committed to aiding 
their military superiority at a time when it is stripping the 
Arabs of the requirements of self-defense. 
  The paper says: The United States would not have gone to 
excess in this course had it not seen a willingness on the part 
of some Arabs to squander the Arab nation's funds in return for 
U.S. crumbs, in return for useless and obsolete weapons and 
aircraft. 
  AL-THAWRAH adds: Those who followed U.S. arms sales to Saudi 
Arabia over the past two decades must have realized that the 
United States has plundered tens of billions of dollars in 
return for obsolete weapons used in World War II. Nobody knows 
for sure whether or not these weapons have actually been 
received by Saudi Arabia. For, after all, the U.S.-Saudi arms 
deals might have been fictitious. Nonetheless, what is certain 
is that Washington has received billions of dollars just to 
maintain the Zionists' military edge over the Arabs. 
  The paper concludes by saying: The big powers, particularly 
the United States, are required to take more balanced positions 
in their relations with world states, and also in their handling 
of issues related to world security and peace. It should be 
unreasonable for them to continue to work to perpetuate the 
unfair embargo imposed on Iraq although it has honored all its 
commitments as enshrined in UN Security Council Resolution 687.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Limited Sovereignty, Another Face of America's </F>
World Order"] 
  [Text] One of the most dangerous concepts that the U.S. 
Administration has come up with and tried to enforce in its 
international policy is the concept of limited or restricted 
sovereignty. 
  This administration considers any developments aimed at 
realizing this suspicious objective as part of the grounds for 
establishing the new world order. This order is a unipolar 
order that ignores the will and aspirations of other peoples and 
the role they are supposed to play in the balance of 
international interests and relations, which are based on the 
principles of mutual respect and noninterference in the affairs 
of other countries. 
  Last year in particular, the United Nations witnessed 
massive 
efforts to propagate this concept of limited sovereignty. It 
saw attempts to provide this concept with an international cover 
that would lend it legitimacy, thus giving the United States and 
its allies the chance to pressure other nations and governments 
to bow to their illegal will to dominate, using the banner of 
human rights as a pretext for intimidation, terrorism, and 
forcing their evil designs without facing any resistance to such 
dangerous trends. 
  In this context, it is enough to refer to the current 
General 
Assembly session debates in which blatant calls were made to 
propagate this U.S. concept. These calls tried to sugar coat 
their arguments with sweet-sounding words and resounding phrases 
with dubious meanings. 
  Regrettably and incredibly, the UN secretary general has 
become a party to this process, and in his discussions he openly 
propagates this concept of limited sovereignty. He does this 
despite the fact that everything indicates that this concept is 
an attempt to violate the sovereignty of nations, or at least 
deprive them of their right to practice their sovereignty over 
their internal affairs under the same pretexts that are raised 
occasionally in the interest of the United States and its allies. 
  Any people that is proud of its dignity and basic right to 
sovereignty over its own land and affairs must denounce and 
reject the concept of limited sovereignty. This is not because 
it is rude to interference in the internal affairs of a country 
that enjoys sovereignty and independence, but also because it 
brings international relations back to the stage when the law of 
the jungle prevailed. It would allow the strong to impose their 
mandate and threaten to use brutal force against those who are 
smaller and weaker by materialistic standards. 
  Hence, the logical question is that if the United States 
wants-- through these suspicious efforts--to interfere in the 
internal affairs of countries under the pretext of protecting 
human rights, is it prepared to accept that the interfere of 
others in its own affairs for the same reason? Human rights 
violations are numerous and dangerous in the United States in 
particular, and in the colonialist West in general. Shouldn't 
other nations have the same right that the United States 
proclaims for itself but at the same time denies to others? 
  Despite these designs, whose nature and timing may or may 
not 
be calculated, the peoples of the world will eventually win. 
This determination will certainly have the final say on all 
practices, violations, and conspiracies that target the world 
peoples and their honorable forces that believe in justice, 
right, and principles. 
  The experiment of steadfast and mujahid Iraq is a model that 
opens the way for those who reject any form of injustice, 
arrogance, aggression, mandate, and hegemony.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Informed press sources cite a member of the U.S. oil 
lobby as saying that American companies have recently concluded 
sizable deals amounting to $40 billions with Saddam's regime. 
The French oil lobby has expressed dismay at this step on the 
part of the regime, since it had earlier promised French 
companies significant privileges. The regime even implied that 
it was willing to grant the Iraqi Majnun oilfields to French 
companies in return for billions of dollars, which these 
companies would have made up for in a matter of weeks through 
oil export sales. 
  France is dissatisfied with the changes, which French 
security sources attribute to the regime's attempts to gain U.S. 
favor at the expense of the promises he made to the French oil 
lobbies. Political observers interpret the regime's conduct with 
France as a deliberate attempt to drag the United States into 
allying with it and negotiating an oil deal that would ease the 
oil embargo imposed on the regime and an attempt to restore 
normal bilateral ties with the United States. 
  In this framework, the Kurdish opposition in Turkey has 
destroyed the Iraqi oil pipeline that passes through Turkey, 
wasting several millions of barrels of oil ready for export--the 
oil that remained in the pipes after the imposition of the oil 
embargo by the UN Security Council. This was reported by 
Turkish sources, but was not reported by any neutral 
international source. Political observers believe that the 
matter is nothing more than an attempt to settle accounts 
between the regime and Turkey concerning the oil that remained 
in the pipeline. Turkey demanded the lion's share with the 
excuse that it had been harmed by the Kuwait war. Saddam's 
regime, for its part, demanded half of the oil. However, visits 
among officials of the two sides, in addition to the Turkish 
political stance that recently has tended to demand a lifting of 
the embargo and the reinstatement of the regime to the 
international family, indicate that this is part of an economic 
deal to enable Turkey to get what it wants in exchange for 
political backing for Saddam's regime. 
  To avoid embarrassment, the two sides preferred to accuse 
the 
Kurdish opposition in Turkey, thus achieving their collective 
objectives. This means that Saddam's regime pays no attention 
to the wealth, resources, and interests of the Iraqi people 
since its ultimate goal is to remain in office and commit the 
most horrible crimes against our kinsmen in Iraq.

<F P=106> [Statement by Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim, leader of the Supreme </F>
Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, on the third 
anniversary of the "15 Sha'ban uprising", issued on 26 
January--read by announcer] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate: To those against whom war is made, permission is 
given to fight, because they are wronged; and verily, God is 
most powerful for their aid [Koranic verse]. 
  On these blessed days, we are reliving the memory of the 15 
Sha'ban uprising, which reflected our heroic Iraqi people's deep 
association with great Islam and their readiness to make any 
sacrifice for its sake. The uprising also reflected the extent 
of injustice and persecution practiced by Saddam's criminal 
regime against this zealous people, and the rejection of this 
regime by the Iraqi people of all their sects, nationalities, 
and social groups. [passage omitted] 
  On this blessed anniversary, we call on our Iraqi people to 
perpetuate the confrontation against the ruling tyranny in 
Baghdad. We call on them to be vigilant of the plots being 
hatched against our beloved Iraq by its enemies, both Saddam's 
gang and the covetous forces that are trying to find a foothold 
in Iraq to practice their sabotage mission on behalf of the 
arrogant forces that seek to serve their own interests. 
  On this anniversary, we also remind the world and all 
virtuous forces that the Iraqi people are experiencing a major 
plight at the hands of Saddam's regime, and are being subjected 
to plots of physical liquidation, terrorism, and confiscation of 
public and individual freedoms. We call on the world and its 
virtuous forces to make continuous efforts to force the ruling 
regime in Baghdad to stop its criminal schemes from being 
implemented in the Iraqi cities in the north, south, center, and 
in the marshlands in particular. The regime is engaged in 
operations of pursuits, killing, economic blockade, continuous 
dry-up efforts, and annihilation of all features of human life. 
  We call on the world and the virtuous forces to abandon 
their 
silence over the Saddam regime's genocide against the Iraqi 
people everywhere. We appeal to the Security Council, the 
United Nations, and their humanitarian organizations to play 
their legal role regarding the crimes and tragedies of Iraq. 
  O sons of the Armed Forces; O Iraqi officers and soldiers: 
The sons of your Iraqi people everywhere have unleashed their 
outcry in the face of the criminal tyrant, expressing their 
rejection of him. They have paid with their lives and pure blood 
for this outcry. They wanted to rid themselves of the tyrant and 
its regime and establish a system that ensures their freedom, 
independence, dignity, might, and honor. You belong to this 
steadfast, brave, mujahid people who seek salvation. This 
people calls on you to be the strong and striking force to 
topple this criminal tyrant, who has violated dignities and 
sanctities, destroyed the country, ruined all its resources, and 
forced humiliation, death, displacement, and disgrace on the 
Iraqi Army. The Iraqi people warn you against being used by 
Saddam to realize his personal whims of despotism, crime, and 
corruption. 
  O honorable officers and soldiers: The current situation 
provides the best chance for the Army and the Iraqi people to 
join forces and wage the battle against tyranny, crime, 
corruption, humiliation, and slavery, a battle for Iraq's 
independence and freedom, which Saddam is relinquishing--after 
having destroyed everything--to preserve his power. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Jalal Talabani, chairman of the Patriotic </F>
Union of Kurdistan, by Georg Hoffmann-Ostenhof in Arbil, 
northern Iraq; date not given] 
  [Text] [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] Mr. Talabani, when will the 
new Kurdish autonomy fail? 
  [Talabani] We have freed ourselves from the Iraqi tyranny 
and this gives us the strength to resist, the strength to bear 
all difficulties. 
  [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] For how long? 
  [Talabani] Forever. Certainly, the economy is very bad. 
But there are also rays of light. Thousands of Kurdish 
villages that were destroyed by Saddam have meanwhile been 
reconstructed. The people are returning to the rural areas and 
they are beginning to produce food again. Last year we had 
enough grain, rice, vegetables, and fruit. 
  [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] Iraqi Kurdistan is surrounded by 
countries that do not exhibit any sympathetic feelings for 
Kurdish democracy -- in Turkey and in Iran there are also large 
Kurdish minorities. And the West does not want Iraq to crumble 
and chaos to develop. 
  [Talabani] In order to avoid chaos, our autonomy must be 
preserved. We will defend ourselves against any attack on us -- 
this will then lead to chaos. Iraq can remain united in the 
long run only as a democracy. 
  [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] Or under a strong dictator. 
  [Talabani] No. A strong dictator has just lost. Saddam has 
split Iraq. Now everybody is fighting everybody else: Sunni 
against Shi'ite, Sunni against Kurd, Turkmen against Arab. 
  [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] When your people fled from Saddam 
Husayn's army, the world paid attention to the Iraqi Kurds. Now 
international attention is rather directed toward the Kurds in 
Turkey and watches Ankara's armed struggle against the 
guerrillas of the Workers Party of Kurdistan, PKK. 
  [Talabani] Turkey must remain unified. However, Kurdish 
rights must be accepted in this framework. If Turkish 
propaganda pretends that there is only the PKK problem, it just 
helps this organization. It becomes popular. 
  [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] Do you feel solidarity with the armed 
struggle of the PKK? 
  [Talabani] Of course, we have differences with the PKK. We 
want nothing to do with its Marxism-Leninism. We do not agree 
with its tactics in Western Europe. We believe that a popular 
struggle is more effective than the occupation of embassy 
buildings or airline offices. Above all, we believe that it is 
not a realistic demand to divide Turkey. 
  [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] Occasionally you meet Mr. Ocalan, the 
leader of the PKK. Do you then recommend that he give up the 
armed struggle? 
  [Talabani] No, but I urge him to look for political 
solutions. Last March he announced a unilateral cease-fire. 
Unfortunately, there was no positive response the other side. 
Ankara did not want to negotiate. The end of this cease-fire 
was a tragedy -- 32 Turkish soldiers were massacred. We 
condemned that. 
  [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] Ocalan is a Stalinist. Can one actually 
negotiate with him? 
  [Talabani] Certainly. One can hold a dialogue with anyone 
in the world. You saw how Mr. Rabin shook Mr. 'Arafat's hand. 
And a short time ago it was inconceivable that Her Majesty's 
prime minister would talk to the IRA. Why should this not be 
possible in Turkey? Mr. Ocalan has indicated to me through 
mutual friends that he is willing to make peace. Whether you 
like Ocalan or not: He heads the biggest Kurdish movement that 
has ever existed in Turkish history. One cannot ignore that.

[place-name as heard] and Darbandikhan, and the peshmerga of our

thieves and highway robbers who attempted to damage and steal 
parts from the Darbandikhan-Bawa Nor telephone network. The 
operation took place at midnight on 27-28 January 1994. In this 
successful operation, the unit managed to capture 14 thieves and 
five cars. They were handed to the judicial authorities so that 
they would receive their fair punishment.

attacked regime vehicles and convoys passing along that road. A 
military vehicle that tried to escape was destroyed and all its 
occupants killed. 
  Meanwhile, our sources said that Islamic resistance groups 
attacked a military bus carrying 23 mercenaries and a small 
military vehicle with four mercenary passengers. The two 
vehicles were completely destroyed, their passengers killed or 
wounded, and huge amounts of military equipment and supplies 
were captured.

  [Text] Air Force and artillery forces of the Islamic army 
launched aerial attacks today on the assembly centers of the 
notorious Golboddin-Dostam militia. As a result, a large number 
of militia troops were killed. 
  A responsible source of the Ministry of National Defense 
told 
a BIA military correspondent that jets of the Islamic army 
bombed enemy assembly centers in Maranjan Tapa and around 
Chelstoon, as a result of which heavy losses were inflicted on 
the enemy. 
  The spokesman added that Dostam-Golboddin militia embarked 
upon a series of movements and military transportation in the 
frontline battle zone, which were pushed back as a result of the 
activity of the Islamic army units. Their dead were left behind 
on the battlefield, and a number of their positions have been 
seized by the Islamic army. 
  A spokesman for the Kabul Garrison General Command said that 
the Golboddin-Dostam militia today fired 464 missiles at Kabul 
city residential areas. As a result of these savage missile 
attacks, a number of innocent Kabul citizens were martyred and 
wounded.

  [Text] A convoy of seven trucks carrying 1,250 tents left 
Peshawar this morning for Jalalalbad. These tents have been 
sent by the World Food Program with the cooperation of Pakistan 
for distribution among the Afghan war affectees. 
  Reports from Afghanistan speak of fresh fierce fighting 
between the rival warring factions in (Chehalstun) and Gazergah 
area of Kabul. The AFGHAN ISLAMIC PRESS reported from Kabul 
that the antigovernment forces used heavy shelling and rocket 
fire against government strongholds in southern parts of the 
city. The television mountain also came under heavy fire. In 
retaliation, the air force of the state Defense Ministry bombed 
the Dostam militia positions in Bala Hesar and (Tappa Maranjan). 
Afghan sources told Radio Pakistan's Peshawar representative 
that this is for the first time in the month-long war that the 
fighting has spread south of Kabul.

  [Text] The Afghan prime minister. Eng. Golboddin 
Hekmatyar, has intensified the last week launched diplomatic 
offensive against president Prof Borhanoddin Rabbani and his 
close associate commander Ahmad Shah Mas'ud. 
  A four-member delegation of the Supreme Coordination Council 
arrived in Islamabad last week to meet the foreign minister and 
other concerned officials. The Council consists of Hezb-e 
Eslami, Junbish-e Milli, Hezb-e Wahdat and Afghan National 
Liberation Front. 
  The delegation members were Abdol Hadi Arghandiwal, 
Hashmatollah Mujadadi, Dr Talib and Abdol Samad. During their 
meeting with Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ali, the delegation 
maintained that fighting in Kabul would continue until President 
Rabbani resigned from his office to pave the way for 
establishment of a broadbased interim government in the Afghan 
capital of Kabul. They said Golboddin Hekmatyar was also 
willing to resign from the office of prime minister. The 
Council is also demanding holding of general elections in the 
country within six months to elect the future government of 
Afghanistan. The setting up of a national army is also one of 
the Council's demands which links its four-point plan to 
restoration of peace in Afghanistan. 
  The Council is also ready to surrender all of their arms to 
the Ministry of Defence of the new government. 
  A reliable source told THE FRONTIER POST on Saturday that 
the 
delegation would also be visiting Iran and Saudi Arabia soon to 
win diplomatic support of these two countries to their peace 
plan.

  [Text] Pakistan has categorically rejected the allegation 
which appeared in the Indian press that a rocket attack by 
Pakistani troops took place in a border township of Punch. An 
official press release issued in Islamabad today says there has 
been no violation of the cease-fire from the Pakistani side. 
The reports played up in the Indian press are obviously part of 
the propaganda war being currently waged by New Delhi to divert 
world attention from the atrocities and human rights violations 
by Indian forces in occupied Kashmir.

  [Excerpts] Islamabad, 29 Jan (MENA)--The Indian Government 
today accused Pakistan of training over 10,000 Afghan mojahedin 
prior to sending them to the Indian state of Kashmir to escalate 
acts of violence and extremism in the state. [passage omitted] 
  Reports coming into Islamabad today indicated that three 
senior Indian security officials died and a number of others 
were wounded in clashes in Srinagar Province. 
  Responding to the Indian charges, knowledgeable sources in 
Islamabad said today that the Indian threats to launch "a 
limited war" along the line of control on Kashmir will not force 
Pakistan to abandon its stand on the Kashmir issue. 
  The Pakistani sources told MENA that if India truly fears 
that "a limited war" will break out and affirms that there is 
shooting on the line, it has not informed Pakistan of this 
officially through the hot line between the directors of 
military operations in the two countries. The sources stressed 
that Indian allegations about the Afghan mojahedin infiltrating 
Kashmir are baseless. They said Indian patrols roam about the 
entire line and that they mined and erected barbed wire along 
it. 
  The Pakistani sources explained that the mountainous 
passages, the only way in for infiltrators all along the line, 
have been completely blocked by snow and that it is impossible 
to pass through them. 
  As regards shooting along the line of control, the Pakistani 
sources said the Indian forces over the past four years have 
been firing provocatively all along the line in the state of 
Jammu and Kashmir. 
  The sources added that it is estimated that India killed 
over 
600 civilians on the Pakistani side of the border recently, 
while Pakistan avoids shooting at civilian targets. 
  The sources accused India of waging a war against unarmed 
civilians in Kashmir and called on India to stop this war 
immediately. 
  These sources affirmed that Islamabad has no intention of 
using force and noted that Pakistan does not interfere in 
Kashmir but supports the just aspirations of the Kashmiri people 
who are struggling for their right to self-determination.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 1, IRNA -- People who packed the shrine 
of Imam Khomeyni to celebrate the 15th anniversary of his return 
to Iran disarmed a man immediately after he pulled out a pistol 
and opened fire during a speech by President Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani, according to a police officer. 
  "As soon as the man pulled out the pistol, the crowd rushed 
towards him and pushed the pistol barrel towards the air as a 
result of which four bullets were fired which hit the ceiling of 
the shrine," Major Mohammad Panahi said. 
  The incident took place when President Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani was addressing a large crowd of people on the 
occasion of the beginning of the ten-day-dawn celebrations 
marking the 15th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic 
revolution. After being disarmed, the man was dragged out of the 
shrine and handed over to Law Enforcement Forces. 
  The officer, who is in charge of providing security for the 
revolution victory celebrations at the shrine of Imam Khomeyni, 
lauded the people for their quick reaction and vigilance. "In 
fact, the Iranian people are the main protectors of the Islamic 
revolution and republic," the officer said. 
  After the shooting incident, the crowd chanted "Death to the 
U.S," and "Death to Hypocrites" a term used for members of the 
terrorist Mujahideen Khalq organization.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 1, IRNA -- A man who shot five bullets 
in the air in a ceremony at the shrine of the late Imam Khomeyni 
this morning said at the initial interrogation that he did not 
mean to make an attempt against the life of any specific person. 
  The 26-year-old Kourosh said "his real aim was to overshadow 
the joy of people at the start of the `ten-day-dawn' 
ceremonies," which marks the 15th anniversay of the victory of 
the Islamic revolution. 
  He fired five bullets into the air while President 'Ali 
Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani was addressing a large gathering of people, 
among them foreign guests. 
  He was immdiately disarmed by the crowd and handed over to 
the law enforcement forces. 
  Major Panahi, a law enforcement commander for southern 
Tehran, told IRNA today that the person under arrest carried a 
revolver, from which the bullets were fired. The handgun is a 
U.S.-made low-caliber revolver, he added. 
  Major Panahi quoted the culprit as saying "he did not plan 
to 
assassinate any specific person. Rather, he meant to terrorize 
people and spoil the celebrations."

  [Text] Our correspondent contacted President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani a few moments ago via telephone. About the 
Iranian Muslim people's concern in the wake of the [shooting] 
incident, the president said: 
  [Begin Hashemi-Rafsanjani recording] I am very grateful to 
the people and to you for taking measures to reassure the people 
so that they do not worry. In my opinion there is nothing to 
worry about. If the exact proceedings of the incident at that 
place [Khomeyni's shrine] were broadcast, the people would not 
worry. 
  As the reporters present saw, the point from which the shot 
was fired was a long way away from the platform. I first 
thought a light bulb had exploded, but when I heard several more 
sounds it became clear, and I came to the conclusion that it was 
not a light bulb but gunfire. In my opinion there is no cause 
for concern at all. It was an incident in the corner of a huge 
gathering in the mosque. The proceedings of the meeting were 
not interrupted either. I am not certain whether it was being 
broadcast live or not. Everything continued as normal. 
  I am very grateful to everyone for demonstrating such 
kindness. I ask you to inform the people somehow that there is 
no cause for concern at all and no one should worry. [end 
recording]
